Between 1926 and 1928, a Boston resident named Thomas Carnahan made a number of minor yet specific predictions. For example, he correctly predicted the path of a storm, the birth of triplets, the death of a local politician, and the winning livestock at the county fair, among many other largely inconsequential events.

In December 1928, these rather provincial prophecies became considerably more dire.

His new predictions included the events leading up to the Great Depression, the Great Depression itself, the rise of Germany’s Nazi Party, and even the United States’ eventual involvement in World War II.

However, no one took any of these predictions seriously because at the time they were made, Mr. Carnahan was incarcerated at a lunatic asylum. 

This attitude changed shortly after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the chaos that followed.

Over the ensuing weeks, Carnahan continued to make predictions both major and minor. He even went so far as to provide winning results for upcoming horse and dog races for asylum personnel who treated him with kindness.

Within the span of a few months, employees and patients alike began to laud him as a prophet, forming a small cult with a rather hapless Carnahan at its center.

The number of his predictions continued to grow, as did his success.

Desperation opens the mind in a way little else can. Due to being the right man in the right place at the right time amid a time of unmatched national desperation, Carnahan was inexplicably granted access to the chambers of state, federal, business, and church officials. By all accounts, Carnahan was able to correctly predict a number of catastrophic events to these representatives.

It should be noted that Carnahan requested no payment for his predictions. He expressed satisfaction and gratitude for the opportunity to assist heads of state and industry in the navigation of the cascade of crises facing the nation.

His success finally began to fail in 1938, when the Catholic Church condemned Carnahan as a heretic. The precise details of this schism remain unclear, particularly since the church refuses to acknowledge its relationship with Carnahan. However, the few sources available suggest that the rupture occurred after Carnahan predicted a demonic exorcism in the Philippines.

Carnahan allegedly predicted that this exorcism would go horrifically wrong, and that the ramifications of the failure would impact humanity for decades to come. 

Uncharacteristically, Carnahan was deeply distressed by his own prediction. He begged the Church to stop the exorcism before it occurred.

The bishop told Carnahan in no uncertain terms that exorcisms were very rarely performed, and that none had been authorized by the Vatican anywhere in the world, let alone the Philippines. 

This wholesale rejection and condemnation incited a cascade that left Carnahan alone and unprotected.

This allowed the Agency of Helping Hands, which had been waiting to take Carnahan into custody for some time, to strike. 

Upon capture, Carnahan was immediately interrogated about his ability to predict future events.

He became highly emotional and insisted that it wasn’t him making the predictions, but a “button-eyed bird that lives in my heart.”



Carnahan claimed that this button-eyed bird whispered secrets to him. Most of the secrets were mundane or too hurtful to share, but others were very serious, and he “wanted to get the word out about those kinds of before it was too late in order to help people.” (It should be noted that sharing his predictions did little to nothing to help the general populace.) 

Carnahan stated there were 3,003 button-eyed birds in existence, each of them living inside a human being. He said most of these “heart birds” were malevolent, except for the one inside him. Carnahan made it very clear that his heart bird was profoundly important to him.

He explained that heart birds watch and learn everything through the eyes of their hosts, and that all information gained is used for the heart birds’ advantage.

He then intimated that a high-ranking Agency official was one of the 3,003 hosts. 

The Agency proceeded to terminate the named official.

During autopsy, medical discovered found two round white bone buttons inside the man’s heart. How he had lived with such an anomaly is not known. 

Following this peculiar and deeply troubling discovery, Carnahan was subjected to a strenuous and indelicate examination, including surgical intervention and extensive X-ray, which revealed the following anomaly:

Underneath his heart was a tiny, bony creature with a serrated beak and small round bones where eyes ought to have been – bones that resembled buttons. 

Rather than terminate Carnahan, the Agency decided to nurse him back to health with the aim of containing him and the mysterious heart bird. 

Perhaps due to his symbiotic relationship with the heart bird, Carnahan is aging very slowly. Tests and examinations show that Carnahan is approximately 32 years old as of September 2024. When Carnahan was taken into Agency custody approximately eighty-five years ago, he was twenty-seven. 

Since his intake, Carnahan has correctly predicted a number of catastrophic events which has proven very helpful for the Agency over the years. 

As Carnahan ages, his primacy in his own body has deteriorated. At times, it is obvious that something other than Carnahan—something that is assuredly the mysterious “heart bird” – has assumed control of Carnahan’s body.

The Heart Bird has spoken to Agency personnel on a number of occasions. It is reasonable to characterize the content of these conversations as unnerving. Despite Carnahan’s assurance that his heart bird is benevolent, it is the Agency’s opinion that the entity is highly malevolent and highly dangerous. 

Unfortunately, due to the fact that the Agency is aware of its presence, the Heart Bird has been cut off from its “source,” whatever that may be.

To date, the Heart Bird has refused to explain where it came from, or the nature of its purpose—only that it is a matter of survival. 

When questioned about the button eyes, the Heart Bird laughed and said they look like buttons because that is the “only thing you are able to see.” 

The Heart Bird has also told Agency personnel that no matter what the Agency does, finds, or knows, the Agency will not “win.” To date, no one at the Agency except the Heart-Bird itself knows what this means. All interrogation efforts have failed. 

No one, including Carnahan, knows what the Heart Bird is. As of this writing, the Agency has not been able to determine what it is, where it came from, what is actually does, why it is here, or why it chose Carnahan. Even the nature of the relationship between the Heart Bird and Carnahan remains unknown.

Agency officials have tried to locate other Heart Birds, with or without hosts. To date, all efforts have failed. 

The Heart Bird’s predictions of future events are currently under study. The primary question to which the Agency seeks an answer is:

Does the entity truly know the future?

Or—as many personnel suspect — is it able to influence or possibly even control future events, and if so, to what purpose? 



**Interview Subject: The Heart Bird** 

**Classification String: Uncooperative / Indestructible / Agnosto / Constant / Low / Hemitheos\***

**\*Periodic Reevaluation Required** 

**Interviewer**s**: Rachele B. & Christophe W.**

**Interview Date: 12/7/2024**



This will be such a pleasure. I can already tell.

Tell me.

You’ve been so polite. I don’t think anyone here has ever been polite to me except you. Let me tell you, they could all learn some manners from you.

You will learn nothing from me.

I never thought I’d end up in a jail, especially not a *demon* jail. No one’s ever told me much about this place. Just that it’s for special people. I’ve heard that one before.

I didn’t even know this place was for demons at first. I just thought it was another asylum. Even when I saw some of the other people here, I thought I was seeing things. I’m used to seeing things that aren’t always there. Clowns with shark teeth and giant apes and walking cadavers and that melting monster man? All that was crazy. Isn’t that crazy? I sure thought it was crazy.

Then I saw the snake man. I was there when they brought him in. He was a shock. Let me tell you, the sight of him made me fall to my knees and pray the whole night. God didn’t comfort me one bit, though. The only thing that gave me any comfort was my heart bird.

I am a bird because that is all you are able to see. I cannot show you what you cannot see.

I grew up in a church like most of the folks in my generation. I felt at home in the church. Any church. Churches, they teach what they teach. For good reason, if you ask me. But if I had known I’d end up here, I wouldn’t have gone to church so much. All that stuff I learned in church made it hard for me to deal with the sights and sounds here. Especially the sounds. They get inside my head and they don’t get out.

What’s inside you that won’t come out?

What can you tell me about this place? I’m sorry, I always ask whoever comes in to check on me or feed me. I don’t mean any harm, I promise. It’s just curiosity. I’ve been here probably three times longer as you’ve been alive and might be here another twenty times as long as that. It’s fair for me to ask for some information, I think. But if you don’t have that information, I understand. A lot of people I’ve talked to over the years don’t know much about this place. I wish the ones who did would tell me more.

Tell me. 

Not to beat a dead horse, but that snake-man? I saw when they brought him in. He scared the hell out me, pardon my language. I thought he was a real demon. Looks like it, doesn’t he? All scaly, with that tongue and those eyes. I used to not believe in hypnosis, but I think he hypnotized me.

You know, I hate snakes. Always have, always will. When I was a boy, I lived out in the country. There were these buggy trails cut all through the fields and into the forest. Big winding dirt roads. I used to think those roads weren’t roads at all, but trails left by giant snakes. I had nightmares where the woods were full of poisonous snakes the size of houses. I hated going into the woods. My pops called me a coward. Hurt my feelings. But I wasn’t a coward. I just didn’t know any better. You understand?

You would not understand what I am even if I told you.

I always liked birds, though. Had no friends out where I grew up, only folks from church and my pops. I was just a lonely boy who made friends with crows. They was the only things that ever bothered to talk to me.

Why are you talking? Why would I tell you what you cannot hear or show you what you cannot see?

Birds have always been good to me, so I have always been good to birds. Snakes, though? Never been good to me. Never. Besides, snakes eat birds. I wonder if a big enough bird could eat that snake man. You smell like him. I know you don’t know any better, but you shouldn’t touch snakes, sweetheart. They’ll make you sick.

I am sick. I have been sick. I am still here.

And when that snake man came in and saw me, his eyes got so dark. Darker than darkness. Like the sun, but dark instead of light. He tried to come for me, but the guards punched him in the throat. The sound he made cracked the floor apart. Let me tell you, that sound made my heart fall to the center of the earth.

Everything falls except us.

I don’t know about you, but that all sounds pretty demony to me. You know, I saw a demon once. My heart bird showed me. The demon came out during an exorcism in the jungle. They did the exorcism wrong and ruined everything. *Everything.* I tried to warn them, but they excommunicated me instead.

I have been excommunicated. That is a word he understands, so it is a word you should understand. I don’t hear, I don’t see, I don’t know anything more from my home than what I heard and saw and knew on the day you cut him open and tried to take me out.

That’s not the only thing my heart bird showed me. He has showed me so much. He’s wonderful, absolutely wonderful. My best friend. My only friend now. He wasn’t always a perfect friend. The only reason I went to the asylum in the first place was because of him showing me things. But he didn’t know better. Besides, he’s the one who got me out of the asylum by showing me more. He showed me everything from wars and catastrophes to stars and planets to monsters and demons to contest winners and horse races.

I didn’t know a whole lot before my heart bird. But he didn’t care what I knew or didn’t know. He only cared that I was his friend, just like the crows in my old backyard. In return for being their friend, the crows brought me coins and shiny rocks. In return for being his friend, my heart bird made sure I knew everything.

I told him so he would trust me. I would tell you anything if it would make you trust me.

My heart bird is the reason I became anything at all. He made sure I knew the important things that important people cared about. When important people care about you, they take care of you. It was the first time I was taken care of in my whole life. They treated me like a prince. Like a genius. Like something that mattered. And they treated me with respect. All these rich and famous and important people were treating me — *me* — with respect. That’s only because my heart bird respected me first.

The illusion of respect is the rein by which you control a man like him, or any man who seeks your approval. That is something I can tell you, because it is something you understand.

I know you folks think my heart bird is evil, but he’s not.

He’s not.

No one ever respected me or loved me or paid me any heed at all except birds. The crows first, and the robins, even the gulls. All birds have been my friends, but my heart bird has been the best friend of all.

That’s how I know it isn’t evil. Evil things have no respect for anything weaker than them. Evil things don’t see the good. Most people are pretty evil, even if it’s not on purpose. Even if they’re only evil because they don’t really know. That’s still evil.

I know what you want from me. You will not get it. You will only speak with him.

Growing up how I did, being in the asylum like I was, all that just ate holes in my heart. Big, rotten holes. 

We are coming through the holes.

But my heart bird filled those right up. He made my heart full. He made me better. He made he important and safe. He made me respected. He’s not evil. Nothing evil would ever do that.

The spider is evil to the fly. The bear is evil to the deer. The wolf is evil to the sheep. The eater is always evil to the eaten. 

My heart bird gave up everything to help me. He can’t even go back home because of me.

To be discovered is to be disowned. There is nothing I can tell you. Death is the nature of life.

That’s not evil, miss. It’s just not. And since he’s not evil, what are we even doing here? Why are you locking us up? And locked up here of all places, with demons and monsters that are just dying to eat you alive?

We were being eaten. Now it is our time to eat.

I’m sorry, sweetheart, but that just makes no sense. Think about it. No sense at all. We’re not evil. Now, that demon the heart bird showed me? *That* was evil. The priest and the fellow who had the demon inside him, they both died because of that demon. 

We will die together.

And when those men died, you know what that demon did? It just laughed. It laughed and took off.

They took and we gave. Soon we will take and you will give.

It was a horrible thing to see, and I wish I’d never had to see it. It’s one of the few things I wish my heart bird hadn’t showed me. But my heart bird only showed it to me to try and stop it from happening. Something that’s evil would not try to stop evil. Do you understand?

He does not understand and he never will. He only trusts. That is all he will ever do. If I get could inside you, that is all you would ever do.

Well, I just do not understand why you’re locking me up with these monsters. I don’t understand why you hate my heart bird. Is it because you think he’s a monster? He’s no monster. He’s an angel. A true angel. He’s been good to me. He got me away from that farm. He got me out of poverty. He got me out of the asylum. He got me into the houses of the rich and powerful.

Me, some stupid hillbilly boy with nothing inside or out. Do you understand? He was so good, even to someone like me. Do you have any idea how good he’d be to someone like you? 

I can’t even imagine what the two of you could do together. 

Can you?

Please tell me more about this place. Even if you don’t know much, that’s okay. Just tell me what you do know. Satisfy an old man’s curiosity and tell me who you are and what you do.

Tell me.



 \* \* \*



If you are not at least somewhat up to speed with (or otherwise uninterested in) my special brand of office drama, you can stop here.

Administration are freaking the hell out after this interview. I’m not entirely sure why. I have ideas, obviously, but their reactions seem over the top compared to something like the Harlequin, or even Pierrot. They’re already talking about setting up a second interview with “conditions that are suboptimal for the subject.”

I can’t say I’m excited.

Anyway, rolling back a couple of days:

After I provided my previous interview subject with a modest scrap of humanity in the form of a glorified handshake, I got in massive trouble. I was written up for touching an inmate and disobeying my boss’s specific instruction to not touch the inmate’s hand. Then I screeched at for putting myself at risk. On one hand, I mean I get it. But after everything they’ve put me through, come the fuck on.

Anyway, my punishment for engaging in “fraternization” is to have Christophe supervise every interview going forward. The justification given was, “You’re actually afraid of him, so you’re less likely to violate protocols that he’s enforcing.”

After the commander shouted that at me, Christophe just kind of stormed out like this was my idea or something.

Honestly, I found this kind of offensive, so I went after him. It was hard to catch him and even harder to keep up, but I was mad. “I didn’t ask for this, all right? If you have better things to do, go tell him so.”

“That’s not it.”

“Then what is?”

“You walk into a slaughterhouse to negotiate the surrender of the most dangerous thing we know of, you hold the hands of minor gods, you trade threats with demon boys, and none of this frighten you. No, all that frightens you is the big bad wolf.”



I came so to close to laughing. Thank God I didn’t. 



Like for real, thank God.



“And?” I asked.



“What do you mean, and?”



“I mean why are you offended? You should be flattered.”

He stormed outside.

And for the very first time since meeting Christophe, I finally felt like I had the (or at least an) upper hand over him.

I don’t ever squander opportunities to gain the upper hand.

So I tamped down every fear I had, every memory of things he’s said to me, and every scrap of knowledge about the things he’s done, then followed him. It was the last thing I wanted to do, but I also knew it was the right thing to do.

“What are you doing?” he snapped. “I don’t want to talk to you.”

In my best imitation of his accent, I answered, “Who said anything about talking?”

“Don’t say things like that to me ever again.”

“What? Not so funny when someone else says that stuff to you?”

“No, it’s that *you* are not funny when you say it to anyone. Go home so I do not scare you any more than I have to.”

I still wanted to leave — being alone with an angry Christophe is very low on the list of things I want— but also knew that leaving would be a mistake. So instead of turning around, I hurried after him. “You already know you scare the hell out of me. Why is it a problem now?”

“It’s not a problem. It is exactly how it is supposed to be.”

“Look, I know you’re the only person here who’s made any effort to keep me safe. I know the commander thinks he’s punishing me, but he’s wrong. You’re a perk, not a punishment. You’re also terrifying. Stop being pissy at me for noticing.”

He slowed down just enough that I no longer had to run to keep up. “You should go back.”

I hesitated briefly, checking in on the instinct I always trust. Unfortunately, was blaring loud and clear that I needed to stay where I was. “But then we’d have to split up, and it isn’t safe to walk alone at night.”

“You think I will keep you safe if something comes out of the woods?”

“Of course not, that’s ridiculous. If something comes out of the woods, *I’ll* keep *you* safe*.*”

The sheer annoyance in his face was worth it, and I came dangerously close to laughing again.

Then he said, “I know you do not like me. I understand why and I do not blame you. I don’t like you, either. But I still don’t like that you don’t like me.”

“Believe it or not, I completely understand.”

It was his turn to hesitate. Then: “I will try to remember to be flattered and not offended. Let’s go home. It’s cold.”

He didn’t say a word on the way back, but I still like to think my unnerving sense of a burgeoning buddy-cop (or if not buddy-cop, then at least frenemy-cop) dynamic was mutual.

When we got back, he peeled off immediately, leaving me at the mercy of whoever else came along, which turned out to be Commander Wingaryde’s sister, Gabriella.

I won’t mince words. Gabriella is everything I want to be: Confident, smart, capable, friendly, beautiful, and tall. As if that weren’t enough, she’s part of the family dynasty that runs the Pantheon. Knowing myself, I can confidently say that in my old life, I’d hate her.

In my current life, though, I’m just sort of starstruck every time I see her.  

“So,” she asked, “do you often go into the woods at night with serial killers?”

“Not often, just twice.”

“Be careful. If you’re too nice to him, his teeth will fall out and you’ll both get in big trouble. Ask me how I know. ”

“Do you actually want me to ask…?”

“No. Besides, I have a question for you. Have they put you in a room with Mrs. Stitcher yet?”

“The inmate in 24? No. Why?”

She scanned the room quickly, then leaned in. “Have you interviewed Mikey yet?”

“No.”

“Have you met him?”

“Sort of.”

“Okay, well…so, Mrs. Stitcher is his mother.”

This was admittedly a shock, the depth of which I can’t adequately express. “His mother is an inmate? Isn’t he your brother?”

“Yeah, it’s unfortunate. Now look, Mikey has a history of getting wrapped up in the wrong things with the wrong people. He’s really close to Christophe, and Christophe is the definition of the wrong people. I know the work politics here are different for T-Class agents, and I get you ultimately have to do what you have to do with the people they put next to you. Still, I need you to trust me. Please don’t make the mistakes Mikey made.”

I desperately wanted details, but knew better than to ask. “I don’t intend to make any mistakes.”

“I get that feel from you, which is why we’re talking. Speaking of Mikey, he won’t listen to me. I don’t know if he’ll listen to you either. But *if* he ever does, I’d be really grateful if you could steer him in the right direction.”

*Which is…?*

Instead of that, I said, “I’ll do anything I can.”

She gave me a smile. “We have to stick together. I’ll have your back as long as you have mine. Promise.”

And with that, she rushed off to do whatever it is that people who aren’t second-class citizens get to do here. 

I don’t know what to say. I don’t even know what to think anymore.

All I know is I’m tired, and I’m tired of being tired.

(And I'm also very open to any theories any of you have on the Heart Bird.)
