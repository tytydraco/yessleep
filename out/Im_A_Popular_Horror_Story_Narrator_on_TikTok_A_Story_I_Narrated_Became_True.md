I’m good at what I do, and I’m building up a huge fan base- in fact I was thinking if it goes on like this I might even be able to give up my hideous day job soon and move out. I put time and effort in my videos- no silly ai voices on my TikToks, thank you very much, and I seems to have a  knack for putting music and animation to the stories I find for free online.    
Sometimes the “authors” dm me complaining that it's their story, I used it without their permission- well that’s just plain silly, such a genz boomery thing to say, yk? How can you “own” a story? And who’s to say they’re not lying- I mean they call themselves “ChunkeroftheNight233” or “LordHighFlies503”, so it’s not like they sound like legit people. It’s just, like, their generation that they’ve spoiled everything for us, and now they’re complaining about some stories on the internet- which everyone knows are free. Besides, even if they are telling the truth, they should be great full for all the exposure they are getting, amirite?   
I mean, the stories are good, there’s no doubt about it- some of them get me, and they get my base too. They think I wrote them, and their happy to send me cash, and, like, maybe if I wasn’t so busy making my videos, I could of. And some of them are just silly, but kind of funny, too, yk?   
Anyway, I just finished narrating this story about a houseplant that started to move and eats meat meant for the OP and his gf. Silly, right? But it kinda gets you too, especially because I do have a huge houseplant- it came from my grandma’s house and mom just dumped it in my room because she didn’t want it in the living room but she didn’t wanna throw it out because grandma, right?- typical that I have to have the shitty houseplant in my room. Actually it was useful because I used some of the pics from the plant for my video, and it actually looked quite good. The fans loved it too, and the likes and comments came rolling in within minutes of smashing that upload button. And $$$.    
And then it rustled. I see its reflection in my screen move before I hear the rustle, actually. I turned around, and there it was, looking big but still. I never realised how big it was. I had heard the rustle, just like the OP in the story heard the rustle.    
I suddenly had a memory flash by- years and years ago, in a school playground. All of us little kids where in a line trying to creep up to the Wolf, who was Mr. Smith, but we could only move when his back was to us. As soon as he turned and looked, we had to stay still. I actually hated that game, and I hated Mr. Smith and his smile and the way he reached out his arms to grab us if we moved. Ugh.   
 They really fucked us up, with those fucking dumb games they played with us, all the fucking time.     
I looked at the giant plant, with its long ugly-ass yellowy dusty leaves.    
“Sam! Sam!” called mom. “Supper!”   
I took my headphones off and sidled out of my chair, still not taking my eyes off the plant. I walked to my door, and then I had to turn to the door.    
“SUPPER!” screamed mom. Jesus Christ. I opened the door. “OK!!” I bellowed back   
Zing! I yelped in pain and almost keeled over as something lashed me behind my knees. I didn’t looked back- just ran downstairs.    
“Mom, I need that houseplant out my room” I said, shovelling pasta into my mouth. My knees where still stinging.    
She shrugged. She had been kinda funny since grandma died anyway. “You can put it out behind the trash” she said. “I don’t care”.    
We ate in silence, and I went back to my room, as soon as I could, eager to get rid of the houseplant. But I couldn’t resist checking my stats on my latest upload first. Wow- this story was doing real amazing. I read the comments- ppl were so happy and they said such nice things about my story. It made me feel amazing.    
And then, as I was busy responding with thumbs ups and “ty”s to the comments, it happened. The rustle. I looked up, but it was too late. The ugly ass leaf was already wrapping round my legs, and climbing up my body.    
I screamed, remembering the horrible thing that the houseplant did to the OP in the story. I’m not going to spoil it for you- go check out my TikTok of my story if you like- I've left it up. It didn’t have a happy ending for OP.    
The leaves didn’t wrap up around my wrists, tho’ but flicked my phone out of hand. It landed, and the screen cracked from side to side.    
I screamed with horror even louder- that was an expensive phone I had gotten and I did all my narrations on it. And then the leaves slapped sharply against my mouth, and stayed there, gagging me. I stumbled backwards, and fell, choking on the bitter green stuff.   
Mom knocked on my door- she knew better than to come in without knocking. But I could only make some muffled gagging sounds. Fortunately, I guess her mom spidey sense told her to open the door- and as she did, the leaves let go of me and scuttered back. She saw me on the floor, clutching my broken phone, wiping drool. “Sam what’s going on?”   
“Just take that fucking plant out!” I yelled at her.    
She looked confused, but she didn’t argue with me. She picked up the pot, and staggering a bit under the weight, she went out. I slammed the door after her. It was her fault for leaving it in my room the first place.    
I looked at my phone. It was just the screen what was broken, the notifications and likes were still pouring in. I felt a bit better, seeing all the lovely comments.    
I stopped narrating for a while now, I mean, but I can’t stop now, I need a new phone. I’ll steer clear of the houseplant story writer tho’. There’s plenty more free content out there.
