[\[Part 24\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1i2jn0y/the_call_of_the_breach_part_24/)

While being relatively poor in most respects, Barron County seemed to have put all its efforts into the construction at the school’s founding in 1905, and it showed. Unlike the blocky, dull construction of most modern colleges, BOU was built into soaring vintage structures of either red brick or white stone, the rooftops capped with gothic crenelations that made it look like a fairy-tale castle. The central clocktower rose like a black arrow to the sky, a huge spire at its height, and stone gargoyles around its roof edge. Rose bushes had been planted in between the footpaths snaking across the green, as well as fruit trees and other flowering shrubs that would have smelled amazing in the spring. A collegial forest bordered the dormitories, a dense huddle of 100 acres of trees that encircled the campus on the east and south, lanced through by a handful of walking trails and picnic areas. It was a beautiful place, one that almost made me wish I could have afforded the tuition.

However, the aura was soured by abandoned Organ military equipment in the courtyard, an anti-aircraft gun in the parking lot, and long rows of razor-wire fence that had been put up around the old utility buildings to convert them into holding cells for ‘persons of interest’. As in the rest of town, crews of eager civilians worked to tear down the fences and cart the equipment off so as to put it to use by our forces, but still, the scars of the past remained. There were more than a few shattered windows, some bullet holes pockmarked the exterior walls, and a shell crater lay in the western gardens where a mortar had decimated the geranium population there. Over all this, the headmaster’s office kept watch, its bay window enough to view the entirety of the neatly kept green.

Furnished much in the same grandiose late-Victorian fashion as the rest of the college, the headmaster’s office was paneled in dark-stained wood, with the aforementioned bay window looking out over the campus, the walls painted a rich shade of navy blue. A gorgeous onyx desk sat in front of the window, and several plush chairs ringed it in a semi-circle, most already occupied by our coalition’s figureheads. One person, however, did not belong, and judging by the gray uniform he wore, the fact that he stood in the center of the half-circle surrounded by suspicious glares, and the rigid pride to his stance told me all I needed to know.

As I stepped into the room alongside Eve, Colonel Riken turned to acknowledge me with a curt nod of his close-shaven head.

*What is he doing here?*

“Private Campbell,” Chris stood behind the desk with his hands laced together behind his back, and nodded at Lucille, who stood waiting in the doorway. “Would you mind watching the door for us, until this is over? It’s a matter of defense secrets.”

Lucille made a quick salute and backed out of the room to shut the door behind her.

Eve found her chair beside Adam, and I settled down into an empty one beside a rather smug-looking Peter, who had put on his full pirate regalia for such an occasion. His sword glinted in the bright electric ceiling lights, his knee-high boots had ben polished, and Peter had added another colorful sash to his waist in true Caribbean fashion.

“Morning, miss daredevil. Looking right peachy for someone who ate a ton of concrete yesterday.” He grinned at me with an ornery glint to his eye and flicked his gaze to my neck. “Someone’s been celebrating, I see.”

At his comment, a few other heads turned to peer my way, and it seemed as though lava boiled under the skin on my face.

*I really need to find a coat or something.*

My embarrassment must have been obvious, because Peter’s face softened, and he tugged a green-and-black checkered sash from the collection of around his beltline to offer it to me. “Green’s more your color than mine.”

“Thanks.” I gratefully wrapped it around my neck and shoulders in something like a shawl, hoping no one else had detected evidence of my ‘celebration’ with Chris.

For his own part, Chris still wore his green coalition uniform, the high collar of which covered up any signs of my affection on him, and he pulled a high-backed chair from the side of the room to offer it to the Colonel. “Would you like to sit?”

Colonel Riken shook his head, a square brown leather briefcase tucked under one muscled arm, a small multi-cam assault pack by his shiny black dress shoes. “My orders were to be brief and concise. I doubt this will take more than ten minutes. All the same, I appreciate the gesture.”

Chris remained standing as well, the two facing each other in impassive stillness. “Why are you here, colonel?”

Opening his briefcase, the towering military man produced a collection of papers bound by plastic rings and set them on the desk before Chris. “I’ve been authorized to offer a new peace deal on behalf of ELSAR. Upon your signature as acting commander, it will go into effect immediately.”

Despite my best efforts, I felt my mouth drop open slightly, as though I would snort out loud with indignance. He couldn’t be serious. We were winning, no, we *had won*, and now ELSAR wanted to talk again? This was nonsense, and I was sure Chris had to see it.

“Why should we bother?” From across the room, Josh glowered at the colonel with a boiling hatred under his features, and his frothing emotions matched my own. “We’ve already seen how good your ‘deals’ are. Koranti’s an idiot if he thinks we’re going to fall for that again.”

The colonel regarded Josh with the same unmoved stare he had for everyone, as if he didn’t fear the potential of being strung up in the courtyard by his polished boot heels. “The incident at the first negotiations was unfortunate, and not sanctioned by myself, or Mr. Koranti. The culprits behind the attack are being dealt with as we speak. You have our sincere apologies.”

Peter flipped open the lid of his stainless-steel flask with a loud *click* and threw me a side-eyed smirk. “Well, that makes everything better, now doesn’t it?”

His face reddening, Josh leapt from his chair, fists balled at his sides. “Apologies? *Apologies?* You murdered our families, you burned down our homes, you *ruined everything*, and you think an apology is going to make that better?”

“Easy.” Chris held up a hand to calm Josh’s thunder and narrowed his sky-blue eyes at the colonel. “Let him finish first.”

Colonel Riken didn’t flinch, didn’t so much as make a sharp inhale at Josh’s fury, as unmoved as a male lion resting in the company of his pride. “The treaty will establish a new peace accord, which you will find is more to your liking than the first. Your alliance will receive unprecedented amounts of aid, including small arms ammunition. If you want the deaths you speak of to mean anything, then you’d be foolish not to at least consider it.”

With that last line, he turned to face Chris again, and the room waited in tense silence for our leader’s response.

A cloud of suspicion reigned over my fiancé’s handsome countenance, and Chris looked down at the booklet, then to the colonel. “How do I know this won’t end the same as the last treaty did?”

Reaching down to his feet, the colonel unzipped the assault pack to pull out a black plastic box with white letters painted on the outside in military stencil.

My blood turned to ice as I recognized it.

*The beacon.*

If I managed to grow old and forgot everything else in my life, I would never forget that cursed box. It had been the price for Chris and Jamie’s freedom when we were captured by the pirates on Maple Lake, and I’d gone through hell and back to get it. I had nearly been killed in the enterprise, and we lost the box when Jamie used it to bribe ELSAR for my surgery after Vecitorak stabbed me. Truth be told, we didn’t know much more than what the skimpy field manual had said about the device, but one thing was for sure; ELSAR never gave gifts, only payments. If they were offering us something so precious, then it meant they expected something very important in return.

He placed it on the desk next to the treaty, and the colonel returned to his rigid stance. “Our mission has always been to contain and eliminate the Breach from the very start. This device was designed not only to act as a military jamming system, but to detect, locate, and eliminate environmental anomalies such as the Breach. When placed in the epicenter of the affected zone, and activated in concert with the others around the county’s borders, the Breach will collapse in on itself, and the hole in our reality-plane will seal.”

Chris blinked at him, no doubt as stunned as the rest of us were. “You mean, you’ve been able to do this the entire time?”

A faint, cynical smile came the colonel’s face. “Yes.”

Anger rippled through the expressions of everyone around me, and I had to admit, I’d never wanted to strangle someone so much in all my life. True, Dr. O’Brian had admitted a much in her dying moments at New Wilderness, but still, to hear it from someone in a position of power made my blood boil. How could they have done this to us, to the countless innocents who lay dead and rotting around Barron County’s landscape? I though back to that family in the farmhouse we’d stumbled across in the southlands, the man, woman, and their two little girls. They could have lived, could have been evacuated, could have been spared the horrendous ending to their existence if only Koranti had acted.

*How can a man have so much money, so much power, and do so little good with it?*

Chris folded his arms, and I could see him bite back whatever he really wanted to say in order to formulate a more diplomatic response. “So, what, you’re going to go through with it now that you’re beaten, is that it? And we should just let you walk around behind our lines based on good faith? From what I’ve heard, this thing could do more than just ‘collapse’ the Breach; it could erase fry our electronics, maybe even make things worse.”

For a moment, the colonel didn’t say anything, and then, I saw his mountainous shoulders fall as he let out a tired sigh. “Not all of us in the security forces wanted it to be this way. My command argued for a full civilian evacuation, a standard cordon to contain the anomalies, and a special team to infiltrate the area so we could plant the beacon. Anyone who knew anything wanted minimal risk, both for our men, and for the local population . . . but we were overruled.”

“Forgive me for not feeling sorry for you.” Sandra quipped from where she sat, shooting daggers with her eyes at him, the hem of her white researcher coat stained red from hundreds of surgeries.

Colonel Riken chuckled, not out of any humor but a morose agreement. “I don’t expect you to. Koranti realized there was more to be gained by mining the Breach for its mutant population than by simply closing it as planned. He wanted to see what it would do, let it run its course through the local area, as a test of how prepared our world is to survive if there was a mass outbreak. None of us expected anyone to survive, and yet here you are.”

“Would’ve been a lot easier if you’d helped us instead of dropping rockets on our heads.” Ethan’s words were colder, his demeaner calmer, but I could sense the dangerous tension in him like a crouching tiger waiting to pounce. He was as mad as anyone, and even if he didn’t bear a weapon, I doubted the hulking oilfield man would need one to do serious damage if he wanted to.

Shifting in my seat, I looked down at my legs, clothed in a soft pair of newly washed trousers.

*He broke that one guy’s legs for attempted rape. Sean might have stood on ceremony for carrying out justice, but not Ethan. Riken better watch his back.*

Without skipping a beat, the colonel shrugged. “We tried. Collingswood was meant to be a full evacuation in spite of Koranti’s orders, but when your forces drove mutants into crowds of innocent people, I had to make a hard call if I wanted any of my men to get out alive. You could have waited until you knew what we were carrying, but you didn’t, and so I gave the order to turn that town into cinders.”

“How heroic of you.” Losing my composure at last, I glared at him with a sarcastic bite to my tone. All too well did I remember the ashes of the town I’d walked through, the constant fires that still burned, the poisoned air that would take years to clear. Thousands of souls, incinerated in mere seconds. How could that be justified?

His eyes landed on me, and Colonel Riken held my gaze with a dull weariness to his own. “War is about preserving what you have, not losing everything on a desperate gamble. It was either burn Collingswood, or the entire southern half of the county. We had more rockets, far more, and the only reason Koranti didn’t scorch everything from the middle parallel down was because I managed to contain the problem by bombing that town. Yes, I killed thousands, but by doing so, I saved thousands more.”

Something about that stuck in me like a thorn from the forest, and I found my previous angst tempered by doubt. There it was again, that same argument made by so many others I’d crossed paths with before; a small sacrifice for the greater good. On one hand, it was monstrous, but on the other, it held a grain of truth. Collingswood had been a debacle of New Wilderness’s strategy, and from the ELSAR point of view, what were the mercenaries supposed to do? Let the mutants feast on the town before driving on to their main supply route? Fight to the last bullet to save a few thousand civilians who weren’t worth the fighting men they would lose in the effort? Pour in more soldiers until the outside world could no longer ignore the convoys of military trucks going through southern Ohio and began asking dangerous questions?

*What would we have done if the tables had been turned? He’s right, they couldn’t save everyone. Besides, being burned to ashes by a rocket is a kinder death than ending up in an Echo Spider nest.*

Another tide of discontented murmurs threatened to mount, but Chris held up a hand to stifle more comments. “Regardless, I’m not interested in your excuses. We’re managing just fine without you, so I’ll restate my question; what do you want?”

Colonel Riken swept the room with his hardened stare to address everyone. “What satellite data we can gain through the regional interference has pointed to a surge in electromagnetic and radiological activity in the county center. We believe that, in a few days’ time, the Breach is going to reach a point of no return, after which we won’t be able to close it. If this eruption happens, it could expand into the biggest we’ve ever seen, enough to affect the entire North American continent. Even *if* most smaller communities could achieve the level of preparation you’ve made now, it is likely the fatality rate would reach close to 90 percent of the human population within the affected zone . . . which equates to over 500 million deaths spread between the US, Canada, Mexico, Greenland, and the Caribbean islands.”

My mind whirled, and I remembered the stranger papers I’d found in Silo 48, the newspaper headlines from another time, another reality, where the Breach had consumed the entire world.

*Mom and dad would never see it coming. They’d be easy pickings for a Birch Crawler, or a bunch of Puppets. Dad’s knee is too bad to run, and mom has low blood sugar . . . oh God, they wouldn’t make it ten blocks.*

Silence coated the air like lead, until at last, Adam sat up straighter in his chair, Eve at his elbow. “What do you need from us, colonel?”

“We want to send a joint task force, with your boys and ours, into the Breach to plant the beacon.” For his part, Colonel Riken made a polite bow of his head to the patriarch and matriarch of the Ark River people, though I could tell from the way Eve narrowed her golden eyes that she trusted ELSAR no more than I did. “We’ll agree to most of your terms, supplies, official recognition, you name it, but we cannot initiate an evacuation without the Breach being sealed first. Once it’s dealt with, our forces will pull back from the border, and you can reopen the highway to bring in foodstuffs from the rest of the country. How’s that sound, Mr. Stirling?”

Adam’s toffee-colored irises swiveled to Chris, and he nodded in his direction. “Commander?”

Chris picked up the bound pages of the treaty to flip through it and seemed to be lost for words.

“You don’t seriously believe him, do you?’ On his feet once more, Josh pointed an accusatory finger at the colonel, his eyes wild with building resentment. “It’s a trap, just like last time. He’s one of them, he’s a genocidal monster, how can you trust a thing he says?”

Pale-faced in dread, Chris held up the booklet for us to see, and I caught a glimpse of a satellite chart of Barron County, with something that looked like a hurricane superimposed on it, only this one wasn’t over any water. Depicted in various shades of red, it spread out slowly, graph-by-graph, over the county map until everything was covered in a dense cloud. More tendrils ran over the county lines, into neighboring states, and as the pages continued, across the whole of the United States.

*It looks like those old documentaries of Pripyat after the meltdown.*

“This is just over a 30-day period.” He rasped, Chris’s voice hoarse, and our eyes met. We both knew what this could mean for us, having read the accounts from those who had managed to post their stories online before the internet went down. This problem was only growing, and like a wildfire, it would devour everything in its path. Vecitorak was a small threat compared to this; the breach meant death for our entire modern world. Without our advanced technology, everything would break down, from water lines to sewage systems. If things had been bad in tiny Black Oak, how awful would they be in a city of millions like New York? What if one of the many nuclear power plants across the country had a meltdown? What would happen if they all did at the same time?

*Thirty days to cover the US. How many until it spreads to Asia, Europe, Africa? We might not lose 500 million people . . . we could lose five billion.*

Frustration etched across his stubble-ridden face, Josh looked around the room in enraged disbelief as he saw Chris’s concern shared amongst the others. “How can you sit there and listen to these lies? It’s not real, they just made it up! I could have done that with some computer paint app in ten minutes!”

The colonel didn’t say anything, just looked at Chris, his weathered face plated with a resigned knowledge. Try as I might, I couldn’t detect any deception in that face, no lies, no malice. It began to come together in my head, like pieces to a broad, horrible puzzle, and a shiver went down my spine.

“Maple Lake.” I found my voice, and drew Chris’s attention, the two of us of the same mind just by sharing that glance. “The southern ridge. The electrical storms. The underground fault line. All of it’s expanding, the mutants are getting more powerful, and it matches what Vecitorak said. This is real, Chris.”

For a moment, he shut his eyes in a defeated grimace, and Chris frowned at the packet in his hands. Despite everyone else in that room, he alone had the power to reject Colonel Riken’s proposal. The fate of not just Barron County, but all our home continent rested on his shoulders, and I could see him struggle under the weight of that responsibility.

*If we do this, we risk ELSAR pulling another fast one to kill us all. If we don’t, we risk the murder of our entire civilization. Either way, people are going to hate Chris for his decision, and our government will have to deal with the fallout.*

When he opened them again, Chris fixed both resolute eyes in a withering stare at the colonel. “So how do we activate the beacon without sending all of us down with the Breach?”

“Once it’s in place, a high-frequency emitter will keep everything in a fifty-meter radius at bay.” Colonel Riken nodded at the beacon with the same flat intonation as if he were instructing new recruits on how to use a rifle. “It has the power to cause damage on the cellular level that’s lethal within seconds, and the mutants can’t stand the noise. So, we put the device in place, evacuate the remaining population to safety outside the county line, and activate all nine beacons together. If all goes well, the populace can return once the Breach is sealed. If not, at least they got clear.”

Chris turned to me, and I could sense in his pleading gaze that he was at a crossroads. “How many days left?”

I swallowed a nervous lump in my throat and fought the chorus of eerie whispers that rose in the back of my mind like static. “Two.”

He scanned the pages some more, talking over his shoulder to Colonel Riken. “What assurances can you give me that this isn’t just a trick to kill more of us?”

The colonel spread his arms with a rueful half-grin. “They sent me. I’m to remain with you, both as liaison for our team and as a diplomatic hostage, until the operation is successful. Do you accept our terms?”

Chris scratched the back of his neck and took in a deep breath before facing the room. “None of this means anything if the Breach isn’t stopped.”

“I don’t believe this.” Josh snarled between clenched teeth, and stomped to the door.

Stepping forward, Chris tried to catch his arm as the resistance leader stalked past him. “Just hold on a—”

“*No*.” He jabbed a finger at Chris, and whatever remained of Josh’s calm broke in a sea of emotion-fueled bellows. “Screw you, screw *all* of you, I’m done taking orders from a bunch of morons who sell themselves out for a free lunch! As for you, colonel, you can burn in hell!”

Josh slammed the office door behind him, and Chris let out a long sigh.

“That’s going to be trouble.” Peter murmured to me, his face no longer drawn into a smirk. He had a dangerous look in his eye, the rare kind he only wore on the occasions where the safety of his crew was at stake.

*Man, I hope you’re wrong.*

Turning to the colonel, Chris took out a pen, signed the papers with a flourish, and handed them back to Riken. “How soon can your men get here?”

With the treaty in hand Colonel Riken checked his watch, and gave Chris a thin, deadly smile. “The first helicopter is already in the air.”
