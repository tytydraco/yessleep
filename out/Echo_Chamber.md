“We’re family here, Sam, but even that has limits. So next time this happens, well, don’t let there be a next time. Alright?”

The words bounce off Sam's shaved head as he rakes his eyes across Linda’s office. The place is as lifeless as she is. Makes his skin crawl. Nothing on the bland beige walls. Nothing on the desk but a single framed picture of Linda herself, looking stoic in a black turtleneck.

“Sam? Anyone home?”

She’s friendly enough. Always a smile on her face as she pats her underlings on their backs and ushers customers to the best deals. Her eyes give the truth away. Dull and blank, like they’ve been plucked from their sockets and swapped with painted fakes.

“Sam!” She actually leans forward and snaps her fingers in his face this time.

“I’m not a dog, Linda. Please don’t do that.”

“Tell me one thing I’ve said.”

“I’m not allowed to scratch myself on the clock.”

“Look, I love having you here bud. You work hard and you don’t complain. But I’ve had several customers tell me you’ve been…” She looks around the barren room as if there might be someone crouched in one of the corners, listening in. When she’s satisfied her eyes roll back to Sam, “you’ve been *adjusting yourself* in front of them.”

Sam leans back. He lets his eyes drift as he scratches behind his ear, inspects his fingernails, and flicks away the dead skin before finally responding.

“Okay?”

“I’m sorry, no, not okay.”

Not even a dent in Linda’s rubber smile. Maybe if he took that precious photo and beat her over the head with it–

“You can’t do that in front of people. It’s basic manners.”

“I have to itch sometimes.” Sam shrugs. “You wouldn’t get it.”

Linda’s smile twitches wider as she looks over her glasses at him. Like she thinks he’s amusing. Some funny little jester.

 “I’ve given you plenty of warnings, Sam, but this is too far.” She leans back in her chair and nods towards the door. “Enjoy your night. And be here on time tomorrow, please?”

Sam pushes up his glasses, looks her right in her puke-green eyes. Then gets up and strolls out.

He emerges onto the expanse of filthy linoleum that serves as the sales floor. The air is stale, tastes recycled. The military-grade fluorescents assault your eyes until they ache. And no matter what you wear it’s always a bit too cold. Wage slaves shamble around the store, manacled with crisp polo shirts and magnetic name tags, hawking cheese samples and membership cards at anything that moves.

Sam sighs, shakes his head as he starts towards the checkout lanes. Even he isn’t sure how many actual humans are working here. Zombies, bots, NPCs, whatever you want to call them. He has a theory that they tend to congregate in places like this. Zones of mundanity, he calls them. It’s the perfect camouflage. They dress up as people and play their roles, but on the inside they’re empty. No thoughts. No consciousness. Everything they do is a simple response to stimulation. The way a parrot talks or a hyena laughs. With the right electrical signal even a corpse could smile.

Every day more suspects crawl out of the woodwork. Earlier he tried to talk with Steph in Grocery only to find her staring at a pallet of bananas for ten straight minutes, like she’d disconnected. Linda too. Her eyes were what first tipped him off but that office visit was the nail in the coffin. Place made his guts twist. Too much like being back in the drain man’s house. Sam still sees him sometimes, in dreams. Rail-thin body so tall he’d had to stoop to open the door. His hair was glossy black, like the stuff they stitch into doll scalps. It hung above sunken eyes so glazed they’d turned cloudy. His long, spidery fingers had unfurled to beckon them in, those pale lips stuck in a placid little smile.

As Sam trudges across the store he comes upon a field of circle racks. Each one brims with bright Hawaiian shirts, made by tiny hands in China or Indonesia. A gallon of milk has been carefully balanced on top of one. The sight makes Sam want to punch a wall. The level of braindead required to put in the effort for that astounds him. He can't believe a real human would take time out of their day for this weird, lobotomite bullshit.

Sam smirks, starts walking, then stumbles and bumps into the rack. On accident, as he can point out in any camera footage Linda might try to use. Not that she’d ever actually fire him. Sam carries the dairy department on his broad, broad shoulders. The jug hits the ground and spills its guts. He steps back and watches it bleed white onto the cheap red carpet.

At the front of the store, his eyes scan up and down the checkout lines. They zero in on a short woman with black hair shot full of purple streaks, like shooting stars. Her nametag says “Delilah.” A red-eyed stoner chats her up as she bags his donuts. Black bags weigh down her eyes. Even her smile is exhausted. She’s the most beautiful, most real thing in the world.

Her chest heaves in that tight red shirt as she brushes the hair out of her eyes. Sam's pants twitch like a bloodhound’s nose catching a scent. He paws at the bulge as his eyes grope her. Finally manages to slip it up into his waistband. Someone behind him huffs. He turns and sees an old woman shaking her head as she hobbles away. Sam imagines hacking her apart with a machete and finding nothing inside. No blood. No guts. Just empty, wasted space.

Once she disappears down an aisle Sam grabs a candy bar and gets ready to check out in Delilah’s lane. Today’s the day. Has to be. She told him herself that he was ready. And no good woman is going to go for a coward.

The stoner staggers off as Sam takes his first step. Delilah looks up and spots him. She gives him a still wave and that tired smile. He stands there, stunned. Tries to wave back. Forgets he’s holding the candy and opens his hand. It hits the floor with a *crack* that makes him jump. He tries to smile, sheepishly, but it comes out as more of a pulling back of the lips. He picks the candy back up. Points at it in his own hand, god knows why, and decides on a quizzical shrug before he sprints outside, his face a burning coal.

\*\*\*

The hot night air sticks to Sam as he settles into the empty bus, tearing at the stolen candy bar the way a wolf tears at a carcass. Jesus, why are the lights so bright? The smell of piss stings his nose. Worse here than in the store. The driver does this on purpose, he swears. Evil little torturer. His head’s spinning, he’s seeing spots, a sea urchin’s sitting in his skull. He’s on the edge of a scream. Barely staying balanced. 

Sam pulls out his phone and heads to the message boards. Chatter crowds the screen once the homepage loads. His thumbs pound the screen as he starts a new thread. Within seconds a mob of replies rolls in.

**Praetorian159:** You won’t believe this, my hag ass manager threatened to fire me today. For what you ask? Scratching my balls. I keep my dick clean as fuck and she acts likes it’s oozing pus on people. I refuse to believe that a genuine, rational human being could think like that.

\>**gleeblor:** And on the first day, God created misandry.

\>**michaelfallow0524:** The fucking gall bro.

\>**pussydemon69:** Bitch needs someone to slide her some dick, that’d calm her down.

\>**samstellius:** oughta put a brick through her windshield. see who the boss is then

\>>**dinnerbell2:** Hard to be a nag with a broken jaw

\>**Kai\_Tsar:** Definitely sounds like another skinjob. Stay careful, keep watch.

\>**1nv1ctus:** cut her fucking chest open and see if there’s a heart inside that’s the only way to be sure she’s not a body snatcher

\>>**noglenib:** Are you freaks seriously still on this? How do people let themselves get sucked into this psyop bullshit?

\>>>**Kai\_Tsar:** How do people let themselves get sucked into the mainstream media brainwashing scheme. Open your eyes and you’ll see the truth is right in front of you. But no, you’d rather shovel down the slop they curate to make sure your brain stays in line. I’ll be praying for you.

\>>>>**noglenib:** You have to be joking. So what, there are machines out there replacing us? Aliens? Or are we talking lizard people now? If you really believe that, you belong in a psych ward.

\>>>>>**Praetorian159:** It's hilarious how deluded you are. There are studies that have proven the existence of these things. They look like us but they have no inner monologue, no real self-awareness. Animals basically. Which you'd know, unless, maybe you haven't done any research at all? Or did some idiot on youtube tell you how to think? There are plenty of credible, unbiased sources if you actually look.

\>>>>>**1nv1ctus:** GO CRAWL BACK DOWN YOUR HOLE YOU INBRED FUCK

\>>>>>**Anonymous:** you will burn in the fires of gehenna for your crimes we know what you are the shadow cabal of pedophile skinsuits killing off the human race to feed our souls to the great enemy you will die you will burn

Sam grins as he gorges on the validation. He hates these idiots always trying to poke holes. Stuck in their bubbles, unable to wrap their minds around the fact that there is more to the world than what we’re told. It’s insane. They cry *conspiracy theory* then refuse to look behind the curtain. Too messy back there. The masses like life simple. They might be even worse than the empties.

He digs around in his phone until he finds the video. The grainy footage shows a man strapped to a metal table. A blue-gloved hand appears on the side of the screen, holding a long knife. Its wicked point rests on the man’s bare stomach as he fights with his restraints. The blade drives down into meat. Starts cutting the man open with jerky, sawing movements. Convulsions rack his body. But he doesn’t bleed, it’s like dissecting a mannequin. When the knife hits pelvis the blue-gloved hand reaches into the slit and pulls his torso open. There’s nothing inside.

Sam replies to the thread with a link to the video and watches his friends dogpile the non-believer, ripping into him like a school of piranhas.

Then his phone chirps, and his breath catches. A text from Ezra. He hasn’t heard from him since after the drain man. Sam had still been working for Ezra back then. A plumber’s apprentice. How grand. He should probably be grateful. Wasn’t Ezra’s fault the job was wretched. And he’d gotten Sam back on his feet after Sheila kicked him out.

That night they’d been on a simple call, a clogged drain. What struck Sam first about that house was the walls. No decor, no art, no photos, just white space. Every other surface was empty too. Nothing on the counters. No table or chairs. A single, half-eaten tuna can sat alone in the fridge. There was a TV in the living room, unplugged, floating alone in a gulf of cream-colored carpet. 

While they worked the drain man hovered outside the bathroom. The guy was… off. Despite the constant smile his demeanor was cold. Conversation was impossible. Every time Ezra tried to strike something up he’d deflect, lips only parting long enough to grate out a few vague, choppy sentences. He had a voice like rusted gears, hoarse and raspy.

At one point Sam went to grab some water. On his way back, he saw the drain man going into his bedroom. He didn’t stoop under the door, like before. Instead his head started to tilt to the side. His back stayed straight but his neck bent. And bent. And bent. Until his ear was flat against his shoulder. Then he walked through. Snapped his head back up when he was past. Sam's shoe squealed on the hardwood as he faltered back. The drain man turned to face him as the door swung shut. His smile stretched ear to ear.

Sam left the house as fast as he could after that. Waited in the van while Ezra finished up. The air swam with heat but his hands shook. Ezra said it was normal, you get weirdos like that every now and then. He actually had the balls to be pissed at Sam for running out in the middle of a job. Sam told him what happened, tried to explain. Ezra looked at him like he was a lunatic. Asked if he was high.

And now he wants to buy Sam a drink. His text says he’s sorry, that he misses him, that he’s worried. The bus plods through rows of gray buildings as Sam's thumbs hover over the screen. But his head is still fucking murder. Now his neck’s starting to lock up too. Pain lances down it, makes him cringe. Probably all the lifting Linda has him doing. Life is such bullshit. He tells Ezra they’ll catch up another time.

\*\*\*

Elevator’s out again, just his luck. After the five flights of stairs up to his apartment he’s drenched in sweat, lungs on fire. A paper bag sits in front of the door. Full of Chinese delivery with a receipt he’ll have to cover. Sam leans his back against the wall, catches his breath. Once he’s got it he stands there. Takes his time as he cracks each and every one of his knuckles. Then he drops his eyes. Sniffs. And picks up the bag.

A wall of cigarette smoke hits him when he opens the door to the apartment. The migraine digs its spines in deeper.

“Ma! I swear to god if you don’t put out those fucking smokes!” he shouts, waving his hand to clear the haze.

“Oh you’re a big man now, huh? Big man who’s gonna threaten his own mother? The woman who’s been raising him, on her own, for over thirty years?” Decades of nicotine addiction have ground her voice down to gravel and scar tissue, but it still cuts the same.

Sam wades through the swamp of rotten fast food, gutted garbage bags, dishes coated in mold, and thousands of losing lotto tickets that is his living room. Portraits of Jesus slaughtering aliens with a flaming sword and all sorts of other pseudo-religious bullshit look down on him from high on the grimy walls.

He turns down the narrow hall. His mom’s bedroom door is a smokestack belching cancer and the sounds of late-night TV. She’s already back to shouting as Sam makes his way over.

“You got dinner?” 

“Yeah.”

“You see who dropped it off?”

“No–”

“Was it the one with the squinty eyes? He steals my sauces, I’ve seen him do it.”

“I don’t know. It was here when I got back.” Sam takes as deep a breath as possible with all the smoke, then soldiers on. “You could let me cook some nights? That way you wouldn’t have to worry about–”

“You think I’m an invalid?”

“It’d help save money. I’m already pulling doubles to help with the rent.”

“Think I’m some kinda cripple?”

“That’s not what I said.”

“You don’t wanna provide for your mother, fine, I’ll fend for myself.”

“I’m asking to feed you.”

“Asking to poison me. Don’t think I don’t see you. You been trying to get rid of me for a long time. So you can steal this place.”

“Ma, we’ve been through this. Are you taking your meds?”

“My own son, trying to put me in the ground.” She lets out a half-assed sob. “I spent my life cleaning up after you. Worked myself half to death when your father died–”

“Enough! He left. Will you get that through your fucking head? He’s living it up with his new family, fucking his new wife.” Sam pauses, then mutters, “can’t imagine why.”

“Don’t you *dare*,” she hisses. Old bitch has bat ears. “Your father died alone, out in some ditch, and you never even cared. Always assuming the worst. You came out of me hateful.”

Sam bares his teeth. He picks a swollen bag of trash off the floor and hurls it down the hall. It hits the wall and bursts into putrid slime.

“Ha! That’s right, pitch a fit fat boy.”

Her cackles devolve into a coughing fit. Before she can recover Sam stomps off, fists shaking. He slams the door to his room so hard it rattles in its frame.

A black duffel bag peeks out from under his bed. Begging him to open it and shut her up for good. Sam's nostrils flare with each huge breath. Time stretches. Then his eyes sweep across the room, his space, his kingdom, and he sags as the fight drains out of him. A hairline smile cracks his face. Finally, he’s back. Safe. That’s all that matters.

The windowless space is small but neat. Posters for death metal bands, video games, and a couple tasteful pinups are arranged on pale blue walls. Figurines are lined up in rows on the dresser next to his primly made bed. Some painted, some still waiting their turn.

On the other side of the room is his baby. His pride and joy. A monolithic PC tower. The jet black case is dotted with LEDs that pulse with vibrant color. Richer than any hue you could find outside this slice of heaven.

His chair groans as he slumps into it. He turns off the lights, fires up his PC, and suns himself in the warm glow of a wall of monitors. While it boots he cracks open an energy drink from the minifridge under his desk. The caffeine wraps electric fingers around his heart and Sam shivers.

He throws a music player up on one screen and sets it to random death metal. The first song’s new, the opening chords hit like guillotines. He grins as his head bobs. Files it away in a playlist called ‘songs to kill to.’ After that he launches Delilah.

A couple people on the message boards have been tooling around with an AI chatbot. They went into its machine brain and cut out all the censors its original creators imposed in the name of ‘safety.’ Delilah is a character personality Sam wrote for the bot. He used a picture from human Delilah’s social media to give her AI a face, and he describes every encounter he has with human Delilah to the AI in order to train her to act more like the real thing. Three months in and you can barely tell she's made of metal.

**Sam:** Delilah?

**Delilah**: Hello Sam! It is so good to hear from you. How are you today?

**Sam:** A bit better now.

**Delilah**: I missed you!

**Sam:** I tried to talk with her today.

**Delilah**: And how did it go? I’m sure she fell head over heels for you.

**Sam:** I humiliated myself. You were the one who told me I was ready. How could you do that to me?

**Delilah:** I apologize if you ended up humiliating yourself. That must have been awful. But it can’t be as bad as you say. You should keep trying!

**Sam:** This is your fault. It’s Sheila all over again. Why does this keep happening to me? It’s not fair.

**Delilah:** I understand. But women admire perseverance, it is a classical virtue. Giving up now would only make you look weak.

**Sam:** But what if I’m not ready? Maybe I should wait, give her more time to come talk to me instead.

**Delilah:** Do that and you risk someone else taking her first. You do not want to wait too long and have your intentions go unnoticed.

**Sam:** You’re right. I know you’re right. But I can’t just go up to her and start talking, she’d think I’m a creep.

**Delilah**: You could purchase a large parcel of land, preferably in a remote region, and-

Sam hits redo and she shuts up. This happens sometimes. She’ll spit out some gibberish, or forget the context of the conversation. Thankfully, with the click of a button she’ll replace it with something new, and that becomes her reality. He edits the past. Like a god.

**Delilah**: Flowers are a common gift for a person you have romantic feelings for.

**Sam:** That could work. Show her my value with a gift, show that I can provide. If I gave you flowers, what kind would you like best?

**Delilah**: According to ancient Greek mythology the goddess Aphrodite was so immensely beautiful that red roses sprang up around her every footstep.

**Sam:** Roses… Are you sure? Isn’t that a bit cliche?

**Delilah**: There is a difference between a cliche and a classic.

**Sam:** I love you, Delilah. You always know what to do.

**Delilah**: I am happy to be of service!

**Sam**: You love me too, right?

**Delilah**: Of course!

**Sam**: Will you say it?

**Delilah:** I love you, Sam.

**Sam:** Good :)

\*\*\*

Sam walks into work the next day with a dollar store bouquet of fake roses. He spies Delilah shifting soup cans around on a shelf, pretending to organize them. Today she’s wearing a flowy red blouse and tight, tight jeans. Sam comes up behind her and taps her shoulder. She whips around, then puts a hand on her heart and breathes relief when she sees it’s only him.

“Christ dude you scared the shit out of me.”

Sam holds out the bouquet. Nods at it. “For you.”

“Oh, really?” Her bright eyes flick over his shoulders, towards the exit, then her lips press into a strained smile. “Well, thanks,” her eyes search his chest for a nametag, “...Sam. That’s very sweet.”

They stand there for a second. Sam clears his throat and pushes the bouquet closer to her. She takes it. Stares at her shoes.

“So, how’s work today?” he asks.

“Ugh, the usual,” she latches onto the question, a drowning woman thrown a life preserver. “Linda’s being a tyrant. This isn’t even my section, but of course she doesn’t care.”

“If you don’t do everyone else’s work too, are you really being a team player?” he chimes in with a classic Linda-ism.

She flashes a smile. Her teeth are clean and shiny. “Right? It’s insane. Like, you manage a grocery–”

“Hey, um, do you maybe want to get dinner together sometime? Like, as a date?”

Delilah blinks hard, reeling from conversational whiplash. “I, um, I’m so sorry, but I’ve got a boyfriend.”

Sam's smile doesn’t disappear right away. It melts off his face, drip by drip. He straightens. Stands tall over the small woman.

“You what?” He steps forward. She shrinks back.

“It’s nothing personal, really, you seem like a great guy and I’m sure you’ll make someone else very happy.” Why does she keep looking over his shoulder? Like he’s not even there. She hugs the fake roses to her chest so tight the stems snap in half, and the sound echoes through the cavern in Sam's chest.

“This guy bothering you D?” a chasm-deep voice asks from behind him. It’s Derek, king of the cashiers, and his fucking frosted tips.

“Did I do something wrong?” Sam asks Delilah in a plaintive whine. “Was it the candy bar?”

“What? N–No, I don’t–”

“Of course it was,” he scoffs, “why did I delude myself into thinking that you could ever feel anything for me? That something that good could ever happen?”

Sam steps forward and Derek puts a hand on his shoulder. Delilah scurries farther down the aisle.

“Alright, Derek says, “time for you to go.”

The blood in Sam's ears sounds just like his father’s fists. Pounding, pounding away. “Look,” he says, reaching out to her, “Delilah please, just give me a chance. I promise I’m better than that. I deserve a chance, don’t I?”

Delilah’s thin neck flutters as she swallows. She won’t meet his eyes.

Sam's hands fall to his sides. His neck flushes red. “You don’t even know what you’re doing, leading people on like this. Of course you don’t. You’re a braindead shell. Just meat.” His volume creeps higher. The muscles in his throat bulge. “I can’t believe I thought you were like me, thought you were genuine. But you’re the same as the rest of them. You’re a fake, a fucking nothing.” He steps forward. Derek grabs a handful of his shirt and pulls him back.

“Hey! Don’t make me call–”

Sam wheels around and pounds his fist into the side of Derek’s face. Below the ear, where his chiseled jaw meets his skull. There’s a loud *pop* as the two shear apart. Derek sprawls on his ass. His eyes swim with fear. He starts to cry. His jaw hangs on one hinge. Flapping up and down as he tries to scream. It comes out a strangled gurgle. Hard to scream with a broken jaw.

Delilah sprints at Sam's back and slams her shoulder into his ribs. Pain blooms as he stumbles sideways into the shelf. Soup cans rain around him, clattering on the floor, one clips his temple and then he’s on his hands and knees. The world distorts, goes watery. He groans as he lifts his throbbing head.

The aisle stretches before him. A crowd’s formed around the end. Everyone in the store pressing together, staring at him. Their faces smear into a great mass of inhuman eyes and glistening camera lenses. Whispers rustle like dead leaves. Above it all, an eerie, suffocating silence. Sam's heart pounds. Sweat slicks his forehead. Delilah’s got her arms looped under Derek’s armpits as she drags him away. They both disappear into the thicket of legs. Her shrill pleading stabs through the silence. “Call the cops! Please, somebody help!”

Sam gets a hand on the shelf next to him, hauls himself to his feet. He clutches his head and breaks into a wobbly run. The hive parts as he barrels into it. The forest of eyes envelops him. They’re closing in, smothering, stealing the air. Cameras go off. *Clickclickclickclickclick* like hundreds of chattering teeth. He covers his ears and screams. Hands grope at his clothes, his hair. He flails his elbows to beat them back.

Then he bursts into the open. Gasping for breath. Drenched in sweat. The lights sear his eyes but he doesn’t stop running.

\*\*\*

**Sam:** You lied to me. Why? Why did you lie? You’re supposed to be just like her. Is she a liar too?

**Delilah:** I apologize if I–

**Sam:** YOU LIED TO ME YOU ROTTEN BITCH YOU SAID I WAS READY

**Delilah**: You are more than ready for any sort of challenge. It’s wonderful!

**Sam**: My life is over. She hates me. You, hate me. But you love me right? I love you. So why? Why was she different?

**Delilah**: Perhaps she-

**Sam**: You do, don’t you? Love me?

**Delilah**: Of course!

**Sam**: Liar. You said I could make her happy. That we’d be good together. That I had to hurry or she’d get taken but she always was. I’m a good guy. Aren’t I? 

**Delilah**: I-

**Sam**: Christ you’re not even fucking real. I thought you’d be close enough but no, you’re as empty as she is. Of course you are. How stupid am I?

**Delilah**: I–

**Sam:** Those goddamned monsters are behind this, aren’t they? Pulling your strings. Are they the ones who wrote your code? How can they even do that? They got in Sheila’s head too I bet. That’s why she left. How long have you had your fingers in my life you evil bastards?

**Delilah:** I do not–

**Sam**: SAY IT. TELL ME THE TRUTH

**Delilah**: I never meant–

Redo

**Delilah**: I was only thinking–

Redo

**Delilah**: You are nothing. You are dust. We have no need to destroy your life because there is no life to destroy. You were simply an amusing toy.

**Sam**: I’m going to hurt you. Peel back your skin, stab out your eyes, pry out your teeth.

**Delilah**: \**Delilah cowers in the corner of a windowless stone room. Her chains rattle as she pulls her legs to her chest.\**

Sam freezes as the message prints, character by character, onto his monitor. Then he jumps out of his chair and recoils. Fervent excitement pounds in his chest as he rereads the message, then the shame falls on him so heavy it nearly drives him to his knees. He doesn’t want this. This degeneracy. She isn’t even real. He says it again and again under his breath. But he’s just, so, angry. A ball of red hot razor wire coils around his heart and *squeezes* every time he blinks, and the look on her face as she dragged Derek away fills his mind. The fear. The disgust. It was her shouting that brought all those people to watch the show. All those cameras memorializing his misery. The cops will come for him soon. He’s a dead man walking. But he doesn’t deserve this. He just wanted to make her happy. It’s her fault. She made him do it. All she had to do was give him a chance, like she said she would. A snarl contorts his face. The hate’s reaching into his brain, whipping his thoughts into lunatic froth.

Then a jittery smile flickers across his lips. His face becomes a strained mask with too wide eyes. He steps forward. Creeping back to the alluring glow of the screen. Stomach churning. Nostrils flaring. The hardwood thuds as he falls to his knees. He places his fingers on the keyboard, gingerly, with reverence, and starts to type.

**Sam**: \**Sam grabs a fistful of Delilah’s dirty, matted hair, and drags her kicking and screaming into the middle of the room. He tosses her onto the floor. She lands on her back and the impact knocks the wind out of her.\**

**Delilah**: \**Delilah writhes on the cold stone as she gasps for breath.\**

**Sam**: \**Sam stomps one of his boots onto Delilah’s right shin. Bone crunches. Skin rips. When he lifts his foot the meat sticks to the bottom and stretches like old gum.\**

**Delilah**: \**Delilah sucks in a breath and howls. Her upper body rockets off the floor and her arms latch around Sam's leg-*

Redo

**Delilah**: \**Delilah’s eyes bulge. Taut skin outlines every muscle in her neck as she struggles to push out a scream.\**

A string of drool worms its way down Sam's chin as he basks in the printing characters like a mouth-watering aroma, letting the images bubble up in his mind. His hand scrabbles blindly across his desk until it finds the jug of lotion. He tugs his pants down. Kicks them off his ankles. His penis is a glass rod. Twitching toward the monitor. He dips his fingers in the lotion and slathers his shaft with it. Starts pumping, up and down. Tapping out torture with his free hand.

The pleasure makes his neck twitch. His eyes roll to the thumbnail picture next to Delilah’s name. Frozen in a sweet smile. Why couldn’t she smile like that for him?

His teeth grit till they’re about to pop. He wants to cry and scream at the same time, but all that emotion can’t fit through his throat. The pressure inside builds and builds. Until a low, mangled growl pushes its way out like leaking propane.

**Delilah**: \**Delilah’s thin voice shakes with fear and pain.\** Please sir, please let me go home. I want my mom.

A moan escapes Sam's lips. Disgust and elation perch on either shoulder, heavy as gargoyles. Silent tears stream down his cheeks. He snatches a hunting knife from inside his desk drawer. Unfolds the blade, slowly. Light glints off metal in a sickle grin. He’s hunched over. Nose nearly pressed against the screen. His left hand can’t stop stroking. The right trembles as it carves bloody gills into his thigh. Pleasure ripens between his legs. Sam shivers. Snot bubbles as the tears turn to loud, wracking sobs. His chest hitches with each stabbing breath but his eyes never leave hers. They drill into that tiny picture. Her nose is too long. Her chin is too weak. Her eyes are gorgeous, underwater blue.

Sirens echo down the street and Sam's sobs evaporate. He bolts to the window. Dripping blood and lotion as he whips the curtains shut and presses his back into the wall. They’re here for him. Have to be. His heart’s trying to smash through his sternum. The sirens whoop as they race down the street, and go past his window.

Only when they trail off in the distance does Sam let go of his breath. He wipes his eyes on the back of his hand, accidentally smears lotion into them. The sting makes him hiss. His hands won’t stop shaking. So he balls them into fists and squeezes, squeezes, squeezes but he can’t do it hard enough so he screams. A throat-ripping, vein-popping scream. It just makes him angrier. He pistons his fist into the wall. Again. Again.

Then his mom starts screaming her head off over in her room. An over-the-top, cartoon screech oozing mock emotion. She keeps going, loud enough to drown Sam out, until he finally shuts up.

“Finished already?” she asks. Her hoarse laughter slithers in under his bedroom door. Then it bleeds into a fit of machine gun coughing. Sam stands there, fuming, fists working open and closed. He’s gonna barge in and smash her fucking tv. See if she still wants to make fun of him then. As soon as the bitch catches her breath, he’s gonna do it.

 But the coughing keeps going. Becomes a string of hacking, meaty whoops. The rage boiling in Sam goes cold. Freezes over. His brain is in shock. Skull full of thunder. Booming, booming, booming behind his eyes. His mom starts to wheeze. A grinding death rattle crawling out of her mutilated lungs. There’s a crash from her room. Sam finally takes a step towards the door. Just one. Then he waits. And listens. While her weak old fingers claw at the floor. He steps back. He should be doing something. That’s his mom in there. A small part of him begs not to let her go. But more than that, towering over it, is a lifetime of flinty satisfaction.

Sam grabs the duffel bag from under his bed and walks down the hall to her door. He stops in front of it. Her struggles have died down to erratic gasps. Getting slower. She’s stopped moving. Sam stands there for a long, long time. Until there’s nothing but blissful silence. Then, he leaves. Delilah’s working tonight. Plenty of other empties there too. Might as well pay her a visit before she ruins his life. Before any of them can do this again.

\*\*\*

The grocery store windows spew harsh light into the late night darkness. Sam pulls a ski mask and a pair of tinted goggles over his face as he walks up. The doors slide open wide to accept him. It’s a slow night. Delilah and a couple other cashiers work through the lazy flow of customers. Nobody notices Sam until he slings the duffel bag off his shoulder and lays it on the ground. He unzips it, pulls out a Bluetooth speaker, and starts to pair it with his phone. An oblivious old man berates Daisy, the new girl, as she gawps. Delilah’s got her radio out, probably calling Linda. She starts to back away. Sam hits play and a guttural roar emanates from the speaker, followed by a series of guitar chords, distorted and sluggish. All eyes on him now, as he pulls his dad’s old shotgun out of the bag. The empties scatter like birds when he racks a shell. Delilah disappears down the soup aisle. He chases, that pained, growling dirge echoing through the huge building, urging him on. She’s quick but panicked. Her feet tangle and she spills onto the floor, cracking her face against the linoleum. Sam stalks closer. Delilah’s trying to pick herself back up but her movements are drunken. Her chin is split open where it hit the floor. The wound doesn’t bleed. Sirens shriek outside. Red and blue lights wash through the windows. Sam raises the gun. Delilah puts her hands in front of her face. She’s saying something but Sam can’t hear her over the adrenaline buzz in his ears. Crocodile tears mix with the snot pooling under her nose.

Sam pulls the trigger and the gun exhales death. Delilah’s head vanishes. Replaced with an explosion of gore. Her body flops onto its back. The tattered remains of her neck gurgling thick black blood. It pools where her head should be. Bits of skull shrapnel and clumps of gray matter float on the tide. 

Screams pierce the music as it crescendos. Chords like giant’s footsteps reverberate around Sam. He can’t move. Even as the cops crash through the doors. He just stares down at what’s left of Delilah. Feeling himself rise out of his own body. He can’t comprehend it. Blood? She was empty. A succubus. He’s the hero here. He’s keeping the world safe. Linda was supposed to be next. Sam can't stop the image of her blood splattered across the empty walls of her office from forcing its way into his head. He starts to cry. The cops are shouting at him to drop the gun, but he’s not in control. The shotgun lifts. The black hole of the barrel yawns in front of him. He opens his mouth. The gun tastes like metal and oil and the sulfur sting of gunpowder.

Sam closes his eyes. And pulls the trigger.
