   
*Darkness.* The only sight visible as my eyes opened and were met with the sheer black that now surrounded me. The skin on my forearm burned with a numbing cold pain and was unnaturally hot and clammy to the touch. I coughed with an ache in my chest at the harsh breath that filled my lungs. A grim and painful silence was all I heard. 

&#x200B;

The taste on the tip of my tongue and lips was copper and ash. My nostrils filled with a burning sensation, followed by a smell of sweet rot. A pulsating feeling overtook my senses as my ears picked up a droning sound in the distance. 

&#x200B;

I found myself to be stuck, unable to move forward toward the sound. It could have only been a few seconds, but it felt like an eternity. Slowly, I put one foot down, followed by the other, and walked a distance that I will never be able to comprehend. 

&#x200B;

Sweat fell into my eyes, followed by a burning sting. I tried to blink away the pain but was rewarded with an equally uncomfortable dryness. I could feel my pupils dilate as the light overtook me, sending a harsh pulsing pain to the back of my head.  The pain was blinding, yet I still felt a great relief overtake me as I could see again, even if I was still in horrible pain with the worst migraine I have ever had. 

&#x200B;

The relief was short-lived as I looked upon my surroundings. I saw nothing that seemed even a little bit familiar, gray stone walls covered in moisture that seemed to ooze out of the walls. The floor was covered in ash that stuck to my feet and stirred up as I walked. Blood-covered areas of the wall caught my attention, and I focused on them and recognized hand prints. I shivered in fear as I walked on. 

&#x200B;

I followed the walls, passing pools of blood on the floor. The horrid smell of copper overwhelmed me as I began to walk at a brisk pace, my breath quickening. That was until I nearly ran into a great wooden door. The wood that made up this door was dark and smelled of rotting oak, bound together with rust-covered iron. A cloud of dust hung in the air and seemed to surround the door as if it was shrouded in mist.

&#x200B;

After taking in the sight of this massive door, I took several steps towards it. A piercing scream caused my ears to ring out, and my whole body began to shake as I fell to the floor. An immeasurable pain overtook me as if to torture me with this noise. The sound was that of several people screaming directly into my ear, and it echoed within my brain. Building pressure within my skull until my eyes began to water. I cried out in pain with a scream of my own, to try and release some of the built-up pressure before my skull cracked. 

&#x200B;

As quickly as it came, the scream dissipated, although the ringing in my head remained. I wiped tears from my eyes and steadied my breath as I slowly rose to my feet. After regaining what little composure I could, I made my way toward the great wooden door yet again. A sound that will now forever haunt my dreams, an immense and dreadful *grinding*. 

&#x200B;

I paused with trepidation as I reached for the handle. How did I get here? What will I find here? Why was I sent here? And most importantly, where the hell was I? I took a deep breath as I tried to prepare myself for anything. I was, however, severely unprepared for what I was about to see as I slowly pulled open the door with an intense creak.

&#x200B;

I took a step back as my eyes beheld a seemingly infinite chamber covered in gore, that was dripping down the sides of it. This chamber seemed to go on up forever, into an untold darkness that seemed to swallow it whole. For a moment, I found myself to be lost in the darkness as if it was pulling me towards it. I was able to break my fixation as I focused my attention back on what was at the center of this horrid chamber.

&#x200B;

At the center of this hellish chamber, was an immense machine of agony. It was made from gears, pulleys, and belts, held together by rusty blood-stained iron. The machine continuously ground and pulsed. It was running at a speed that seemed both archaically slow and impossibly fast. I could feel the rumbling of this horrific machine deep inside my chest. My eyes watered in fear as I looked the machine up and down, taking in its crude build. I could smell a putrid stench I was unable to identify. 

&#x200B;

As my eyes focused back on the area in front of me, I was met with the crippling gaze of a horrible creature. This beast in front of me was gaunt, and its skin was a shade of lifeless gray. It turned its head towards me, and its mouth formed into a smile. The smile, however, was not warm or inviting. It held a horror behind it, unlike anything I had ever experienced and it held a deep lust in its eyes.

&#x200B;

Sounds of screaming broke me free from its gaze, and I looked to see several similar creatures who were dragging a man behind them. This man screamed, and he begged as the ones carrying him turned to me. Stretched across their faces were smiles that held untold horrors behind them, and in their eyes, I saw all-consuming greed.

&#x200B;

I looked at the man they dragged behind them, his voice was hoarse and his skin was bloodied. He shouted to the creatures that held him with confusion in his voice,

&#x200B;

*"I followed the word, and all that was taught to me!"* 

&#x200B;

This was when I noticed he had a blood-soaked cross hanging from his neck. His despair turned into hateful anger, as he spewed wishes of death towards the ones he had followed. He spoke of his parents, how they raised him with discipline and stole away his zest for life. He spat as he spoke of the priests who told him how to live his life, how to judge others, and how to hate his fellow man for following their hearts. After being surrounded by such hate his whole life, it now fully engulfed him.

&#x200B;

I was shocked to witness a man of faith be so filled with hate. I was unsure what fate awaited him. The creatures dragged the man up the lower part of the machine. Smoke spewed from the insides as the gears turned faster. 

&#x200B;

The creatures all turned and looked back at me as they began to feed the once-screaming man into the gears. 

&#x200B;

The man did not beg, and he no longer pleaded; he only began to maniacally laugh as his whole body slowly was pulled into the shredding gears. His insides spilled out and his blood sprayed my face as the gears went to work, crushing his body. Skin, bone, and muscle all tore and ground as if being devoured by a starving animal. Until only a part of his face and a single eye remained trapped within the gears of the machine. 

&#x200B;

My friend, what took place next, is why I have written this account. For it's a horrible memory I cannot bear to keep within anymore.

&#x200B;

The man, who was now minced by the gears of this great machine turned his eye and looked at me. He blinked, only once then narrowed his eye. What remained of his mouth, formed into a wicked smile that burned itself into my very soul. 

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

I jarred myself awake and quickly grabbed the trash can just beside my bed. I was sick for a few minutes, as what I had seen would cause me to be ill for days. I sprung out of bed, ran to my washroom, and threw cold water on my face. In an attempt to calm myself, and rinse away the bile on my lips and sweat from my face.

&#x200B;

The nightmare, or what I was sure must have been one, was over. I took several deep breaths and found my lungs were not painful or heavy. My skin was not hot, and I no longer smelled sweet rot. However, I could still hear the droning and the grinding of that horrible and immense machine.

&#x200B;

When I opened my eyes, I began to whimper as I felt a tear roll down my cheek. For the reflection of that ungodly smile looked back at me. 

&#x200B;

….

&#x200B;

*Hell is but a great machine, believe me, I've seen it. Ever turning, forever tormenting the souls of those whose life actions cursed them with an eternity in this place. A machine manned by the most horrific creatures, whose only lust in life is to cause untold suffering to the ones enslaved by the faceless monstrosity of this ghastly machine.*
