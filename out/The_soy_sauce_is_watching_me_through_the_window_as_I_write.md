So, that\^ ... I guess I’ll give you guys the backstory ...

Basically, my grandmother used to make her own soy sauce. Which was like next level shit. Like, I don’t know if umami is a real thing, but if it is, this soy sauce was it.

We used to visit my grandparents about twice a year, and the soy sauce was always a highlight. My granddad had a garden. They’d do like a stir fry with fresh veggies and pork. Ahhhh! That shit was bananas. Or there was this rice noodle dish she’d make. I don’t know what all was in it, but I know it was the soy sauce that made it so insane. I would literally sell my soul to get another taste of the stuff.

My granddad eventually passed away, and after a few years my grandmother got super old and couldn’t really do much on her own, so we had her move in with us. She stayed with us about a year before she died. But she never made the soy sauce during that time. That whole period felt like a slow end to my childhood. Honestly when she stopped making the stuff, I think I grieved more than when she died. Not because I didn’t love her, but it was just such a part of who she was. It hurt worse than when she started forgetting my name. When we eventually buried her, it felt like she’d already been gone for over a year.

Pretty soon after she passed I went off to college, and eventually moved across the country to teach at a high school in Raleigh NC. I’d visit my parents like once a year or so, and call my mom on her birthday, but for the most part, I was pretty detached from my childhood. And I didn’t really think about it much. 

Anyway, like 6 months ago, I got a new client named Tian Hua and it pretty much floored me. That was my grandmother’s name… I hadn’t really thought about her in years. Just seeing her name unlocked something in my subconscious, because the memories started flowing and I … Oh God, it’s sucking on the window … what the actual fuck …

Ok I shoed it off with a broom… Sorry this is kinda stream of consciousness… I swear I’m getting to the point, I just wanna make sure ya’ll have the back story in case it’s relevant… I’m kinda at a loss here.

So, ya… I got all homesick and shit, and I ended up using all my vacation time and heading back to my parents.

All my grandmother’s stuff is in the attic, and apparently no one in my family had gone through it in the 12 years since she died. My dad was kind of apologetic when he admitted he hadn’t touched it. But I understand. She was his mom.

Mostly it was your typical old people stuff. Like someone boxed up the contents of a Goodwill… A porcelain figurine of a teddy bear nurse… embroidered bed covers that were probably white at some point… a pendant of two dolphins nose-to-nose making a heart shape. That last one at least was sterling silver, which I guess would be cool if I were willing to sell my grandmother’s old jewelry, lol.

I looked through it for like 2 days before finding her old soy sauce equipment. I wasn’t really looking for it specifically, but when I found it, I was like, “oh shit! This is what I was looking for” … if that makes sense … Anyway, the crazy thing is, in one of the jugs I found a letter she had written me, apparently shortly before she died. 

It was really sweet. And I don’t, really, feel like sharing it with you guys… but, I suppose giving ya’ll more context is better, in case it’s relevant… So ya, here it is transcribed:

 

My Dearest Granddaughter,

As I sit by the window, watching autumn turn to winter, I find that my thoughts are mostly on spring and summer. I am reminded of the many beautiful moments we've shared. You have always been such a joy to me, and I am so very proud of the person you are and are becoming.

I have a special gift for you, one that has been passed down through our family for generations. It is the cherished recipe for making our family's jeungyauh \[soy sauce\]. This recipe is more than just a list of ingredients; it is a piece of our heritage, a symbol of love for those who came before us, and of dedication to preserving our traditions.

I remember the first time I made our beloved jeungyauh. It was with my grandmother, your great-great-grandmother. How could I possibly forget? \[here there’s some Cantonese that I don’t understand, followed by an exclamation point\]! And in the end, a transcendent pleasure, black as night. It was then that I understood the importance of this craft, and I have cherished it ever since.

You were always the one. I knew it from the time you were a baby. You always liked her best. I just wish I had more time. I wish I could be there in person to watch you make it for the first time. But I find myself wandering in a fog most days, the moments of clarity fewer and fewer. So I’m writing you now, in the hope that when the time is right, you will pick up the baton and carry it forth.

I know you will treat it with the same care and respect that I have. The equipment may be old, but it is sturdy and has served me well. If anything breaks though, no worries, pots and jars can be replaced. The recipe, written in my own hand, is enclosed with this letter. Follow it with patience, love, and utter precision.

Remember, my dear, that making jeungyauh is not just about the end product. It is about the process, the time spent creating something truly special with all the generations who came before.

With all my love, 

\[more Cantonese\]

Grandma 

 

So ya, that was the letter I found with it. And I’ll just say preemptively, I know it sounds kind of gushy, but if any of you guys make fun of my grandma, I’m not gonna engage. I’ll just block you and report you to the mods... simple as.

Anyway, the recipe was there, like she said, along with some hair tied up in a ribbon. Which was weird… but at the time I thought it was just like, a sentimental thing or whatever, and I left it in the envelope.

In hindsight, it’s kind of whack that I lugged all of the equipment back to NC with me, but I honestly didn’t really consider not taking it. I kinda had tunnel vision. It was weird. And the same with making the soy sauce. It was literally all I thought about. I didn’t even dawn on me how weird the recipe was until I caught myself bending over the brew, dropping pieces of my grandmother’s hair in, and chanting something, in Cantonese I guess. 

I’m kind of getting ahead of myself. Cause it’s not like I blacked out or anything. I remember the whole brewing process, but it just didn’t seem weird until that moment. See, I hate hair in my food. I mean, I know everyone does, but I straight up won’t finish something if I find a hair in it. I even threw up one time when I pulled a 2 foot long hair out of my gumbo ... gag, gag gag gag ... I still can’t eat gumbo... Sorry, I’m getting sidetracked. But all that to say it was like my, disgust at intentionally adding hair to the mix, kicked whatever nostalgic obsession had taken over. It was kind of a, “what the actual fuck am I doing” moment. And then with the benefit of hindsight, it all seemed insane.

I mean, I was making soy sauce. So not everything was weird. I had to soak and steam the beans. And there was toasting and grinding the wheat. But each day during the initial fermentation, I had to add a piece of parchment with Cantonese characters on it… ya… There’s a paintbrush with the equipment that looks ancient as hell. And then every evening during the brining period, just as the sun went down, I’d chant something over the mash… ya, I know… I don’t speak Cantonese, but my grandmother scrawled out whatever it was in English letters. That took like 4 months. But again, I honestly didn’t think anything of it until after it was in the ceramic aging jug with the soy mash filtered out. That’s when the recipe had me adding the hairs... gag...

So that pretty much brings y'all up to speed as far as the brewing process goes... I mean at least as far as what I’ve done. The recipe did call for one more thing that I DID not and WILL not do. \*cough\* adding 4 drops of my own blood... like, how the hell did I read that for months and not burn all of that shit............... smh.......... vlw;kals;nvl;nvnl;vlnasvlnasnvlnaslasnkadlnkasvlnkasvlnk

Sorry... lol... but ya... I didn’t do anything else to it after adding grandma's hair... I just left it out in the yard… The recipe had me move the jug outside for the final aging process, so it was already out there. I just haven’t touched it since. 

And now it came back… and has been tapping on the glass for like the last 3 paragraphs... which I have been trying to ignore... \*sigh\* ... I know I should probably be more scared for my life than I am, but it’s been crawling around for like 3 weeks now... and I’m kind of past all that. But I guess I should fill you guys in... We’re almost there.

Basically 3 weeks ago I’m sitting on my back porch and I see this black amoeba like thing, but maybe more splashy than amoeba? I don’t know, I’ve never actually seen a giant amoeba before. Anyway, it comes around the side of the house and races across the yard after a bird. And then fucks of back to where it came from, looking all disappointed when the bird flies away. So ya, that scared the shit out of me. I won’t go into all the details cause nothing has really come of it, but I called animal control, multiple priests, Buddhist, Shinto, Catholic. I even tried getting ahold of the Vatican cause the Catholic priest didn’t really take it seriously. Pretty much, when anyone else comes around, it takes off, of course. I’m not sure if anyone believes me about it... but whatever...

I bought holy water on ebay, which didn’t do shit. I tried putting garlic around, but it ate most of it. I had the idea to try appeasing it, I’m not really sure to what end, but I found out it doesn’t really have any particular affinity for Asian food, who knew. Mostly it eats the eggs from my fridge. Or any small animals it manages to catch. There's got to be like 2 dozen squirrel/lizard/bird carcasses around my house. I think it’s even gone after my neighbor's cat a few times. Yes, I’ve tried fire, soap, diluting it with water. The thing is it’s really good at gtfoing whenever it’s threatened. And it’s pretty much impossible to trap... I don’t know what else... it likes to hang out in glass containers...

But ya, it’s taken to watching me for like hours at a time. I mean it doesn’t have any eyes, but I know that’s what it’s up to. It mostly keeps its distance, but sometimes it’s a bit obstinate and doesn’t want to move… I have a bleach spray I use, if it does anything super annoying. I taught it to quit bringing bones in the house.

Honestly that’s pretty much the current situation. Maybe there’s more, but I think I’ve been pretty exhaustive. So I guess... I don’t know, I’m kind of at a loss. I’m not really even sure what to ask... Has anyone had something like this happen to them? Also... what the hell do I do now?!? ..... uhhh, does anyone have any ideas for names? ... jk, lol... that shit has got to go...

Hope you guys aren’t offended that reddit is LITTERALLY my last optionXD...
