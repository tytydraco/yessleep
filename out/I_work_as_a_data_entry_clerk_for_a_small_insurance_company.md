 My name is Sean. I work as a data entry clerk for a small insurance company. Every day I sit at my desk surrounded by towering stacks of paperwork. 

The task of inputting data into the computer has become a mindless routine. 

Staring at my computer screen, my eyes begin to feel heavy as I reach for my coffee. I take a sip of my mocha coffee before returning to work.

Thankfully, The coffee seemed to do the trick. I spent hours typing, but it felt like minutes.

 As I looked at the neat stack of paperwork I had just finished, I felt something like a sense of pride. 

However That warm feeling was replaced with cool dread as I saw the remaining towers of papers I needed to work on.

 I was tired, but I knew that I had a deadline. So I grabbed my coffee and took a sip. 

To my surprise, What I expected to taste and what I tasted were different things entirely. I was expecting to taste mocha, but when I took a sip of my coffee, the coffee was caramel - I hated caramel flavoring.  

I spit the vile liquid out and turned my cup, assuming I had somehow swapped cups with someone else. 

However, what I saw when I turned my cup confused me. The cup had my name on it. 

I didn't have time to think too deeply into it, I didn't want to fall behind on my work. So I tossed the coffee cup into the green trash bin under my desk and got back to it.

I typed for hours and watched as my coworkers went home for the evening. The work day ends at four but It was dark when I finished my work for the day. 

As I made my way outside, I called a cab.

I always call the same cab company when I get off work late. The driver for the night shift is always friendly and after many rides together, I consider him my friend. 

I sat on the bench outside and as I waited, I went to pull out a cigarette when  next to the pack I felt a piece of paper in my pocket. Curious, I fished the paper out of my pocket and upon further inspection, I realized that it was a receipt for the coffee I had purchased earlier.

The receipt read, one large mocha coffee.

“Isn't that odd?” I thought to myself, My thoughts of confusion however were cut short as I heard a car approaching.

 I looked up to see my favorite cab driver pulling up to the curb. I had a long day sure, but at least now I was with a friend. I waved and smiled at him.

He didn't wave or smile back. He might have even looked annoyed. Despite his seemingly annoyed state, As I entered the cab, I was excited to talk with the driver.  
However, this time, the cab felt different. The once warm and friendly cab driver that I had many enjoyable conversations with in the past now averted his gaze when he caught me studying him in the rearview mirror, as we rode in silence. 

A silence only broken once.  I asked how his day was, and he never answered. 

The only time the driver spoke to me was to verify that we were at the drop-off destination.

 I looked through the window and saw that we were. I thanked the driver and tipped him as usual.

After I paid him, He quickly drove away, as if he was in a hurry, and I wondered what had happened to change the demeanor of such a formerly friendly man.

 I walked up to my apartment building and as I approached the door to the lobby I could hear my neighbors fighting inside. 

I looked through the window and saw one of my neighbors, an elderly man in a fist fight with another tenant in the building.

 I hurriedly turned my key in the door and rushed inside. When I entered I found that the lobby was completely empty. Not only was there nobody fighting, There wasn't anyone there at all. Just me in a state of fight or flight, completely by myself.

 I felt foolish for a moment and decided that I really just needed to rest. I passed the other apartments, before quietly slipping into my apartment. 

After stumbling to my bed, I fell asleep almost instantly. I felt the world fade around me. However this rest was short lived, as I soon woke up to the sound of my phone ringing. I answered the phone and it was my boss. 

My boss told me that I was lucky I wasn't fired. Confused by this, I asked him, why?  
He told me that I didn't show up to work yesterday and that I better show up today if I wanted to keep my job.  

Before I could reply in any way, he had already hung up. I hurriedly got ready for work and called the cab company.

 As I waited for the cab to come, I smoked a cigarette.

 When the cab pulled up, I was surprised to see that the person driving it was not the morning driver, but the night-time cab driver.

 I was even more surprised that he seemed to be in a great mood. Last night was a little odd, but at least today he seemed to be back to his normal and usual self.

 We chatted and laughed the whole drive to work and it made me a lot less nervous about what I knew was going to be at the least an awkward conversation with my boss.

As I walked into the building. The lobby pulsed with the nervous energy, its very walls seeming to vibrate with my anxiety.

I made my way to my boss's office and I stood outside his door, mentally preparing myself for his lecture.

 Before I could enter his office, the door swung open, and as my boss emerged from the doorway, I was confused because he didn't seem to be angry like he was on the phone this morning.

 His eyes lit up as he saw me and he said, “ Good morning, Sean. I really appreciate you staying late yesterday.“ What should have been a moment of relief and even pride was instead a moment of confusion and dread , creating an uneasy feeling in my stomach.

 I was confused. I asked my boss why he called me this morning about me missing work the day prior. 

The smile that once seemed carved into his face dropped suddenly, replaced by a look of intense confusion. He tilted his head to the side and said, I didn't call you this morning, Sean. The unease in my stomach intensified as I slid my hand into my pocket and pulled out my phone. 

“I'm pretty sure you did. Give me one second” I said.

As my boss and I stood, each locked in this uncomfortable moment, I checked my call history. I saw that he did, in fact, call me this morning. “If you look right here, you'll see you did call me, “ I said to my boss as I handed him my phone. He took the phone and immediately froze. He looked at the phone. He looked at me. He looked back at the phone and giggled. “Sean, you do realize you handed me a dead phone, right?”

 He slid me back my phone and laughed as he said, “ You're funny, Sean. I don't always understand your humor, but I know you're funny. Have a great work day.” 

Before I could respond, he had already slid back into his office. Happy that I wasn't fired, I made my way to my desk. As I passed co-workers, they smiled at me, but I could feel their smiles fade the moment I looked away. I sat down at my desk and accidentally knocked over the bin. I went to put the bin upright, but I was thrown off by its color.

 As far back as I could remember, my trash bin, much like all the other bins in the office, was green. The bin that I was looking at was bright red.

 I heard a noise and looked up to see a co-worker walking by. Their sudden presence startled me and I blurted out, “New bins!” My co-worker looked at me like I was crazy before asking, ”What?”.

  I explained to my co-worker that my bin has been replaced by a red one. My co-worker looked at me bewildered and said something that I couldn't believe.

 “I've Worked Here for over 20 years; the bins have always been red.” I stood up and looked at the other cubicles in the office and sure enough, under each desk every single bin was red.

 Still in disbelief, I pulled my bin from under my desk and in the bin was a disposable coffee cup with my name written on the side.

 My mind reeled and I was trying to make sense of the world around me, but it kept getting stranger. I slid my bin back under my desk and watched my co-worker walk away, clearly annoyed. 

 If my co-worker would have walked away in a way that made sense, I might have been able to explain away all the other oddities I've been experiencing. 

What they did when they walked away, however, made no sense. I watched them walk to the back of the room by the printer and straight through the white wall.

 “What the fuck? “ I said out loud as I walked to the same wall I had just watched my co-worker vanish through. I reached out and touched it. The wall was solid. There was no way that what I saw was possible. 

Thinking about it made my head hurt, but I knew that something was wrong with either reality or my perception of it.

I found my boss and told him that I needed to leave early for the day before I stepped outside and lit a cigarette. I pulled my phone out of my pocket and saw that it was fully charged.

 I called the cab company and to my surprise I heard a phone ring across the street from me. I looked up and saw the cab parked on the other side of the road.

 The driver waved me over,  I crossed the street and I got in the cab. The driver looked familiar but I couldn't remember his name. He was being very friendly, but there was something wrong with his face. I realized that while the cab driver's face looked happy and kind, his eyes looked wild and angry, almost demonic. 

I asked him what was wrong with his eyes, and he laughed in an octave I'd never heard before. for just a moment The sky darkened, and I lost my ability to breathe. The car seemed to stand still as if time had frozen. The only proof that time wasn't frozen completely was the rapid beat of my own heart pounding in my chest. 

In that moment, I felt both like I was going to die and that whatever was happening wasn't ever going to stop. However, just as quickly as it came, the moment passed. I found myself shaking and staring through my fingers at the floor. I felt cold.

  
 I was afraid to look at the driver, for fear that I would not see a friendly face. I only dared look up when I heard the driver ask me a question. In a very normal and familiar voice, the cab driver asked me,” Hey buddy, are you okay?” I looked up and recognized him as the night driver for the cab company. I told him that I was fine, just a little ill. He mentioned a doctor he was going to call on my behalf. I told him that he didn't have to but he really insisted. I thanked and paid the driver before stepping out of the cab.

  
To My absolute horror as I watched the cab drive away, it was rammed off of the road by a public bus. The bus slamming into the side of the cab forcefully,  that for a moment it looked like they became one. Like some kind of vehicular hammerhead shark.

 I blinked hard and rubbed my eyes, when my eyes readjusted, I was able to see the cab driver turn the corner of the road, driving the cab completely undamaged. There was no bus, and there was no crash. My head hurt.

  
 I decided I needed to get home. I hurried into my apartment building. In the lobby, there was nobody. However, every apartment door now stood open, even mine. I walked through the door of my apartment, but as I crossed through, I felt cold, before I exited through the front door of my office building. I was so afraid that my legs gave out and I fell on the ground. The cold concrete was a reminder that I was certainly not in my apartment. It was so cold that I instinctively jumped back up to my feet.

 I looked back at the building and it was closed. Everyone had gone home for the day. I checked my phone and this time it didn't turn on. Without another option, I decided that I would spend the evening on the bench, under a light blanket of snow. 

I woke up early the next morning, in my apartment. shivering in my warm bed.  
 I checked my phone and realized that I was going to be late for work. I hurriedly got dressed and called the cab company. As I waited for the cab to come I smoked a cigarette. When the cab driver arrived, I was nearing the end of my cigarette, so I flicked it into the street. 

As I entered, I noticed that it was a totally different cab driver. He didn't seem annoyed, but he didn't seem friendly, I assumed it must have been someone new. I asked what happened to the usual day time driver and the new cab driver told me that he was the only cab driver the company had and as far as he knew, the company he worked for didn't offer rides after 5 pm because they only had one driver. This made no sense to me, I was sure he was new. 

As we rode in silence I studied his face, it was totally unfamiliar. When he dropped me off at work, I tried to pay him, but he refused payment and gave me a card to call a doctor. I took it to be kind, but I wasn't planning on calling the doctor. 

As I stepped out of the taxi, I shuddered at the sight of the bench. I don't know if it was a dream or not that I spent the night there, but regardless, I wasn't a fan of that bench at that moment.

I looked past the bench to my job. I was eager to get back to work and get my mind off of all the craziness. I walked in, but everyone was busy working, so nobody said hi. I did, however, catch some odd glances from people before they went back to their work.

 I sat down at my desk but when I tried to log onto the computer, it told me my credentials were invalid. As I tried and failed to get into my work computer, I heard someone approaching. I looked up to see my boss coming with an angry look on his face and two armed security guards.

I tell him that I'm struggling to get into my computer and he says to me in an angry tone, “That's because it isn't your computer. You've never worked here.” I felt dizzy when i heard those words.  My boss had security escort me out of the building and as I heard the doors lock behind me, I saw the bench covered in snow, in an otherwise sunny environment, that could only be described as summer like.

 I wiped the snow off of the bench and reached into my pocket to grab my phone. Despite removing the snow the bench was still cold and wet. I sat uncomfortably and called the cab, I smoked a cigarette while I waited for it to come. 

Once I was in the cab, I heard the driver say, “short trip today.” When I looked up, I was glad to see that it was the night-time cab driver that I remembered. I was frightened by my job. I was frightened by my neighbors, and most days I was frightened by the cab.  I wondered to myself when life got so incoherent and scary. My thoughts were interrupted by the driver letting me know that we arrived at my apartment.

As I got out of the cab, I remembered that I had forgotten to pay him. So I reached into my pocket for my wallet, but I couldn't find it. When I turned around to see if I had left it in the cab, I saw that he had since left. I turned back around to face my apartment and my heart sank. It was nighttime now and I was standing in an empty lot, where a building might have once stood, but where no building stood now.  
 I stood alone in the lot and noticed snow falling. Not knowing where to go, I walked back towards the road where I found a familiar bench covered in snow. I wiped the snow away and laid down to rest. I closed my eyes, and as I drifted away from the world, I felt heavy and cold.

 I woke up to the sound of a car horn. It was the night-time cab driver. He asked me if I was getting in or not. I chose to get in. It would be a nice break from the weather. He studied me from the side of his eye and asked, “Same place as usual?” I answered yes, and as we rode, he mentioned that I should call the doctor he gave me the card for. I thanked him again for the card and reassured him I would call the doctor. He gave me a kind nod and left. As he drove off into the distance, I watched him go, but nothing crazy or unexpected happened. Maybe I don't have to call that doctor, I thought to myself.

 I turned away from the road, but what I saw didn't make any sense at all.  
 I saw that damn bench that I've suffered on so many times, and that was not a surprise to me. What surprised me, what shocked me to my core, was the decaying structure of what appeared to be a defunct, out of use building.

 The building looked similar to the one I work at, but it was in such a state of disrepair it would be hard to believe anyone has been there for years. I opened the front door, and the smell of still air made the place feel extra abandoned. 

 I heard rhythmic tapping sounds from deeper into the building. I was so scared. I didn't want to search any further, but I felt like I had to. I had already gotten this far, and I wasn't sure of the alternative. I followed the sound of the typing. It grew louder as I drew closer.

 I was halfway to my destination when I realized where I was headed. I was a layer cake of dread and anxiety when I walked up to my desk. I peeked over the top of my desk, and I saw a man sitting in the dark, staring at a blank monitor, typing. I asked, who are you? The man looked up at me with what I recognized as my own face before vanishing. 

My mind struggled to grasp what was going on in front of me. I stood alone in the dark above my rotting desk for what felt like an eternity, as my mind reeled. I was about to turn away from the desk and leave. To run away from that desk, to run out of this building, to keep running until things made sense to me again, but as I went to turn away, the computer screen lit up the room.

 I turned back towards the computer and recognized the login screen. Not knowing what else to do, I put in my username and password. To my surprise my credentials worked. The computer loaded up my desktop, all of my work files were still there, but when I clicked in on them, they were all empty word documents. Hundreds of professionally labeled blank files. Other than what was missing, there was also something new. A folder on my desktop, labeled My Diagnosis. 

All of this was too much, my mind ached, my eyes burned, my stomach hurt, I felt so cold, but I had to know what was in that folder. I clicked open the folder, inside of the folder was a pdf file titled, Patient File - Sean M. I clicked it open and as I read the document. the words in the report burned in my mind. 

Patient Name: Sean M

Current Status: Unemployed, Homeless Following Eviction. Isolated.

Diagnosis: Chronic Delusional Disorder (Severe).

Current Delusion: Structured employment as a 'data entry clerk' for an imaginary insurance company. Uses the abandoned former worksite as an anchor for the delusion.

Daily Behavior: Breaks into defunct job site, sits at desk, performs repetitive, meaningless actions (typing on blank documents) for eight hours. Uses public transport) to maintain the illusion of financial autonomy.

My stomach dropped out of my body. It wasn't my memory or the world that was broken; it was me. Every weird glance, every disappearing building, every change in the trash bin—it was all logged here, in my own files. I dragged my eyes from the screen, looking around the dilapidated room again. No co-workers. No stacks of paper. Just cold, still air. 

I felt the card that the cab driver had given me in my pocket, the weird things that have been happening have been terrifying, and the text on the screen was enough to seal the deal for me. I was done living this way. I was going to call the doctor. 

I pushed my hand into my pocket and pulled out the doctor's business card. I held it in my hand, studying it for a while, I knew that it was supposed to be a good thing, the thing that saves me, but it felt dangerous in my hand. I started dialing the number but as I got to the third digit I froze. I realized that I would be trading all of my comfort away for a reality I never agreed to participate in. I thought about how I would be trading all of my stability, and everything I know, for a tomorrow that was guaranteed to be worse  
A reality where I didn't have a home, a job, or any friends. 

I didn't want to do that, I felt angry, sad, and confused, but I knew what I wanted to do. I tore the card to pieces, and as each piece fell, the room changed. Until suddenly I was sitting at my desk surrounded by towering stacks of paperwork. 

On my desk was a fresh mocha coffee with my name on it. I sat down and started working. After I finished the first stack, I grabbed my coffee and took a sip. What I expected to taste and what I tasted were different things entirely. I was expecting to taste mocha.  
But when I took a sip of my coffee, the coffee was caramel.
