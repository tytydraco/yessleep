Am I able to type? Oh, I am. I am. Still, I cannot move my hands very well or stretch my fingers. A callus is forming around the tips and there’s this weird numbness left over from the moment most of my soul left me from my fingers. But I have to type this out - I MUST. I don't know what will happen to the text. Will it jumble up into nonsense the moment you look at it? Hell, I am not sure if I am writing sense. I have my suspicions but I’ll continue.

I dare not tell you any details. *That bastard* will come after me if you find me. He told me that once I fall asleep and wake up, I’ll forget all that happened. Can you believe it - half my soul ripped away, rotting inside the basement of my college’s lecture hall but I’ll never know of it? He said that my stomach would try to choke on itself and that my veins would try to deny themselves the ability to pulsate, but I’ll live on miserably. But should I divulge details to someone, even death won’t save me. I looked into the bastard’s eyes when He said that - I believe Him. So I’ll be frugal with my information, but I will warn you. If not for myself, then for my mama’s belief in good.

I joined my college three years back. You would’ve heard of it. It’s a pretty famous one that prides itself on providing an equal future for its students. Coming from a piss-poor family, it was heaven - I was getting opportunities I could’ve never dreamt of in my wildest dreams. I imagined a future where I was making boatloads of dollars, one where my mama was content. I took extra courses, extracted recommendations, got the perfect grade, everything you can imagine, I did it all with neither a word of despair nor a want of sympathy. But for what?

All the while, I used to notice the graduating batches and returning alumni. The not-so-good performing ones were a bit flushed and sad, yes, but the well-performing ones looked horrible. Not so much in appearances but in the look of their eyes. The eyes looked like the skin a snake has just before it decides to shed it. All papery, with no substance inside. For three years, I chalked it up to their lack of perseverance and hunger. Three hours back though, I realized a disturbing truth - these people lack a complete soul.

Tonight was the main event, *the* placement interview. Not any normal one, mind you, but for a senior position at a gigantic White Shoe banking firm, the likes of which are extremely rare. It was scheduled in a small classroom in the Lecture Hall Complex. As the interview progressed, an eerie dread grew inside me. By the time I was offered the role, I was sweating profusely. I sent mama the good news. An old lady, a staff member of the Placement Cell, nudged at my arm, asking me to come to the ‘Equity Room’ and fill out some documents. I went with her into a dimly-lit room and suddenly, she locked me inside.

I felt Him before I saw Him. The eerie dread was now a python wrangling his prey, a creeper wrangling his host. About Him… I shudder to describe Him. I can’t, I can’t… or I might lose my sanity. He was smiling. He said in a voice I dare not describe, “I was brought here a hundred years ago when this institute was being built with brick and mortar. I have one task: to keep this place equal. But you’ve overshot the average student and to make you equal to him, I need to take part of your soul. Tell me. What do you want: a complete soul or a more equal job?”

My phone rang. It was my mama. “Pick it up,” He said. My mama… so happy she sounded. She was crying. “My child, how proud you make me!” she mumbled through her tears.

He started speaking to me again, not speaking even... We could talk in our thoughts. *While you think it over, I have a question for you. Tell me quickly or I’ll ask your mama. There are twenty-five parts of your soul and we have five racing tracks. How many races do you need to find the fastest three pieces of your soul? Quick, quick. Tell me.*

“We’ll move out of the trailer and get a home. A big one, my child. And one of those flashy cars, won’t we?” my mama was saying. He looked at me and a shudder passed through me. The question was easy enough. *We’ll race five pieces of my soul at a time. So that will be five races. Then we’ll race the winners of these once to find the fastest piece and then another one to find the relative ordering of the next five. So that’s seven. Seven races.*

As I answered him, I saw it all happen before me. My soul left my body, split itself into twenty-five pieces. The races happened in front of me. It was awful… a coldness swept through my body. The winning three pieces of my soul were celebrating, oozing pus and making screeching sounds. But my mama could not hear anything. “You’re on the call, child? You are happy, aren’t you?” She sounded concerned. I told her I was fine. “Of course, you are! It’ll change our life overnight, make us filthy rich. Tell me, when is the joining date?” She kept questioning, until she ran out of breath. “I have some documents to fill out before they confirm the job, mama. I’ll call you in a while,” I told her and cut the call.

Laughter boomed in the room. I could feel my eardrums oscillating violently. *You are wrong. To find the fastest three parts of your soul, we take away twenty-two of them. The remaining three are the fastest.* He started slashing through the pieces. They started flying, making horrified contorted versions of my face until He captured them. Each time He caught one and threw it behind Him into the basement, I felt weaker than before. The last thing I saw before I fainted were the three remaining pieces reintegrating into my body.

That’s it. Most of my soul, eighty-five percent of it, to be exact, was taken away. It is horrific. I can already see happiness recede away from me. I must warn you - I MUST. Don’t go to these crazy-ass huge colleges and work your ass off. Be average, it might save you. But don’t do badly because the more you drag down the average, the more an above-average student will be tormented. Heed my advice or be ready for your soul to be taken away.
