"You do know who lived in that house, right?" 

"Have you found the journal yet?"

"Have you heard the whistling? Your name being called?"

All questions I have been asked in this tiny town far too often. Every since moving in the old farm house in the "resting lands" of the Appalachia Mountains.

I found the moutains to be beautiful along with the well-aged farm house. Sure, it needed work but the charming character lured me in before I ever even stepped inside for a tour. 

After purchasing and moving in, the locals let me know "that was Louanne's house". 

The realtor didn't give much background on the house. I found out through the rumor mill that Louanne slowly lost her mind before vanishing completely. Rumor also had it she kept a journal detailing her descent into madness and her weird experiences with the moutains. 

"The creatures came for her!" They claim.

Rubbish. Absolutely rubbish. 

Or so I thought before today. 

While working in the yard behind the house, I walked to wood line and noticed a tall decayed tree stump. It was almost completely blacken, as if someone had tried burning the stump. 

I stood on my tiptoes in order to look down into the hollow trunk. Lots of debris was at the bottom but something caught my eye. Something red barely visible above the dirt, twigs and dead leaves. 

I was back at the stump with my step ladder within 15 minutes. As I climbed the few steps, I leaned down and reached until I was able to grab, what I discovered to be, red fabric.  

I pulled hard as the top of the jagged trunk dug into my stomach.  The red balled up fabric broke loose and I nearly fell back off the small ladder as I stood up, clutching the red ball to my chest.
Once I had safely climbed off the ladder, I placed the red ball on the grass. As I carefully unraveled the fabric, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 

It was a dark leather bound book wrapped in what could have been the tattered reminisce of a tshirt. 

I grabbed the book and headed into the house. I sat in what I called the "gathering room". It was a large room with a massive fireplace. 

Seated in an old rocking chair, I opened the book and felt my heart start to race. It was exactly what I feared it was. Though it appeared a few pages had been ripped out from the front of the book.

Dearest Diary,

John has left for the city. Business he claims. I begged him to stay but he insisted it was important. I hate being alone here, especially after dark. The scratching at the windows keeps me awake all hours of the night. With John here, I feel much safer. He promised Andrew, our closest neighbor and groundskeeper, would be by early tomorrow to check in. Andrew tells me to ignore the scratching and to never go outside after dark. At least he listens to me and tries to help as John ignores me. 

The sun will soon set. Maybe a dog could help me feel safe when he's away?

With love,
Louanne."

My hands began to sweat as I gripped the soft, somewhat damp leather binding. The inside of the journal was in surprisingly good shape given it's age.

The tops of the pages were a bit frayed and stained. Some of the ink was smeared but still legible. 

I turned to the next page, the crisp sound of the far too long pressed together pages breaking apart filled my ears.

Dearest Diary, 

Andrew came by, just as John promised. He even came in for a cup of coffee. I was so thankful for human interaction. I sometimes feel I'm the only person in existence out here in the country, so many miles from town. I wish John would purchase a second vehicle so I could leave this place more often when he's away. I told Andrew something new happened last night. Knocking. Loud knocking on our bedroom window. Andrew told me to continue to ignore anything I heard after dark. I wonder if he thinks me nuts? John does. Perhaps that is why he leaves me so often. 

I still think I'll get a dog. A large breed. 

With love,
Louanne"

The sound of a loud BANG pulled me from the journal as my eyes darted around the large empty room. I closed the book and set it on the coffee table in front of me. 

I looked out the window on the far side of the room. The sun was setting but I could see one of the two big flower pots I had placed on each side of the top of the stairs leading to the porch had been knocked over. 

The ceramic shatters were all over the porch, clumps of soil as well. The colorful flowers that were once planted in the pot were also scattered and crumpled, as if they had been stomped on. 

Strange. There had been no wind and I hadn't heard anyone on the porch. I decided to leave the mess for tomorrow. I also decided that was enough reading for one night. 

I left the journal where it laid on the coffee table and headed up the stairs to my bedroom. After a hot shower, I felt a bit better.  Thoughts of the journal entered my brain as I knodded out into sleep. 

Scratching! I was certain that's what I heard as I became more awake. It sounded almost like nails on a chalk board as the sound hurt my ears.

I sat up straight in bed. The shrill almost squeaking sound faded as my eyes darted around the dark room. I finally glanced at the alarm clock on my nightstand. The digital green numbers displayed 4:10am.

Nervously, I reached over and switched the small lamp on. Yellow light spilled over the room. I turned and faced the large window located behind the king sized bed frame. 

I peered through the blinds while feeling my heartbeat in my throat. My vision was blurry through the thick glass. I pulled back then reached for the pull strings to the blinds to the right, I took on a sharp breath as I pulled hard. 

I froze as the blinds lifted and I looked at the glass. No wondered I could barely see out of the window. The glass was covered in multiple long, jagged streaks. I imagined a large animal digging furiously to get inside. 

However, my bedroom window was at least 13 feet off the ground level... what was tall enough to reach such a height?

I immediately thought of the journal I had left downstairs. What I had done by finding it and then being stupid enough to read it was beyond me. 

I couldn't stop now, I could feel that. 

I grabbed my phone and headed out the bedroom door. The hallway was illuminated with the same yellowish light as I flicked the switch on the hallway wall outside my bedroom door.

I could only hear the padding of my bare feet hitting the cold hard wood floor as I hurried down the stairs to the lower level. 

I was surprised to find the tall standing lamp in the gathering room on, filling the room with more of a whitish light from the LED bulb. 

Had I left it on the evening before? No matter. I was thankful as I walked over to the coffee table and grabbed the leather journal in my hands. 
I quickly tucked it under my arm and headed back towards the stairs and up to my bedroom. I didn't bother to cut any of the lights off. 

As I climbed back in bed and sank under the covers, I opened the book to the next entry.

"September 1st, 1978

Dearest Diary,

It's been a few days  since I have written. Yesterday was wonderful.  Dreama (Andrew's wife) came to visit and took me into town. We enjoyed shopping and chatting over lunch. I almost begged her to take me back to her house as we drove up the long narrow driveway to the farm. Things were quiet until I awoke to a strange new sound. It was after 4:00am when it woke me out of a dreamless sleep. Whislting, right outside our bedroom window. It was a somewhat familiar tune. Maybe from my childhood? All I know is it felt like it was calling to me. In my drowsy state, I felt myself get out of bed and head downstairs in the dark to the front door. Just as my hand touched the cold metal of the door knob, something inside of me screamed "DON'T"! 

Suddenly, I was fully awake and aware of what I was about to do. I felt cold chills cover my body as I turned and raced back to the bedroom. I locked the bedroom door as I slammed it shut. 

Andrew had also visited again the previous morning. He told me of the strange markings on the outside of the front door. 

Please, John, return to me soon. They almost got me tonight.

Fearfully,
Louanne"
