Well, hello there. I guess it would be a good idea to start by introducing myself? I don't know, I'm fairly new to these kinds of pages.  
  
My name’s Mike (Short for Micycle... if Mom hadn't stopped Dad) and I am your very traditional screw-up. I’m a normal dude by most accounts. I work an average job as a small-time writer at my local newspaper and live in... wait, the rules did say to stay away from identifiable information, so maybe let's not go around divulging where I live? Well... you just need to know that, just like the town I live in, my life was pretty beige… or at least... it used to be until last year.

It’s been almost exactly a year since everything changed, so I figured I’d share my experiences here in hopes that, if you were to find yourself in a similar situation, you may be able to avoid making the same mistakes… or so I call them, but I’m not too sure I would do things differently if given the chance.

But, anyway… It all began on Halloween night, 2024.

A friend of mine (let’s call him Bob), invited me to a pub crawl organized by some local places. 

Have you ever been on one? You basically pay a fee and then spend the whole night going from bar to bar drinking like you have something to prove. It wasn’t a good idea. I don’t even like getting wasted, shit, I’m *terrible* with alcohol. But life had been boring and, well, Bob’s fun to be around, so I thought, *hey, maybe just one night*.

A part of me still wonders how things would have changed if I had just stayed home and watched a bad horror movie instead.

By three in the morning, we were on our fourth or fifth stop. I was more than a little past my bedtime, so I parked myself at the counter and asked for a shot of tequila. The bartender gave me the look you give a toddler reaching for a power outlet, then handed me something that tasted like pure regret.

That’s when I saw her there, standing by a speaker.

She mixed well with the other party-goers, dressed as she was, but her long, brown dress, wide hat and long gloves didn’t actually look like a costume, it looked like she had been ready to go to a Gala of some sort but had ended up in this dingy pub. 

Under the dim pub lights, she looked stunning, the kind of stunning that makes you forget your own name.

For all means, I’m average looking. I have a permanent stubble that grows back the minute I try to shave, messy brown hair that doesn’t want to sit in one shape for longer than a minute (Some friends and colleagues have said it sometimes looks like it moves on its own) and the bags under my eyes make me look like I sleep three hours a week (Which with my work schedule is sometimes sadly true), so by any means, that woman was waaaay outside of my league.

But to my inebriated mind, not trying to, at least, talk to her would have been a waste.

I don’t remember much, really. Just a flash of her smile and the sound of her laugh somehow reaching my ears beneath all the music, to my eyes, she looked amused. Now that I look back at it, I remember thinking it was strange no one else had tried talking to her before.

I remember taking her hand as we moved across the dancefloor together, her fingers cold in mine, and then I remember walking out of the pub with her in tow.

I remember thinking of calling for a cab, but given that I lived relatively close to the pub, I guessed the cold air might help to sober me up.

Next thing I know, it’s morning.

I woke up in my apartment, head pounding. The bed was a mess, like I’d collapsed into it fully clothed, but I had no memory of getting there. No memory of… well, anything after leaving the pub.

Then Bob called.

“Dude, you left alone last night,” he said. “Are you okay?”

“Uh, no. I didn’t leave alone,” I said. “I’m pretty sure I left with someone.”

“Nope, pretty sure I saw you talking to a wall for, like, half an hour. Dude, you were *gone* gone. I had to pay your tab, by the way. You can pay me back later.”

That’s when I heard it, the sound of my coffee maker starting up.

I told Bob I would call him later and walked towards my door, sure that on my kitchen I would see that he had been mistaken, that I had, in fact, left the pub with that lady.

And I saw her, sure… but just for a split second. She looked as good as the night before, but under my apartment’s lights her dress didn’t look as brown as it looked sepia, like taken from some faded old photograph.

And her eyes? I only saw two embers looking back at me under the shade of her wide hat.

For that split second I saw her smile a smile that was a bit too wide for comfort, and then… she was gone…

The pot sputtered and hissed while I was stood there, too stunned to move, until the kitchen smelled faintly of freshly made coffee.

Did you know ghosts can interact with some machinery? I didn’t. Turns out the lady from the bar knows how to use my coffee machine… just not very well. Her coffee always comes out tasting a little ashy.

I still drink it. It feels... rude not to.
