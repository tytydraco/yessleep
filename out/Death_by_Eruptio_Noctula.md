Do you all remember that guy who died a little over a decade ago from an owl bursting through his stomach? My father was the lead detective on the case before it went federal though as far as I can tell it’s never been solved. I mean how does an owl even get inside someone’s stomach?  
  
I’m sure most of you have seen the videos but for those who haven't heard of this strange occurrence, I’ll explain what happened March 14th, 2011. All the information here is either from my own research, my father’s experience or a combination of both.  
  
Mayor Bently was running for reelection. Dad said he remembers being shocked by it at the time considering all the scandals. March 14th, he was giving a speech at city hall. His first public appearance since all the allegations. There was a substantial crowd and his supporters were numbered.  
  
The videos are eerie to watch. One moment he’s bullshitting his way through the response to a woman’s question and the next he’s doubled over clutching at his stomach. Someone called an ambulance and security escorted him off stage though his visage of pain only got worse. He collapsed after descending the stage steps, writhing and screaming.   
  
Dad wrote in his report. “Angelina, the woman who called the ambulance thought it was a heart attack until “it” happened. She also added that she was not won over by Mr. Bently’s response to her question. Showed a strong distaste towards him. Called the ambulance because it was ‘the right thing to do.’”  
  
Despite security’s attempts, there are at least a dozen different videos, a dozen points of view that managed to capture what happened next. Paramedics cut open his shirt and jacket. Honestly just remembering the image of his stomach bulging and shifting makes me feel somewhat lightheaded. Bodies shouldn't ever move like that.  
  
Delirious from pain Mayor Betly hit one of the paramedics, and he had to be restrained. From then the video only gets worse. He goes still and passes out from shock as blood dribbles from his lips. Paramedics immediately begin putting him on a gurney to get him into the ambulance.  
  
One shot is also cinematic as you see his rippling belly on display for everyone to see as he’s hoisted up. Just as the paramedics finally stand it breaks through, blood beginning to dribble as the writhing and flapping of flesh gets worse. People start truly shouting. One of the paramedics drops him.  
  
Dad interviewed him afterwards. “I’ve never seen anything like that. I mean, there was clearly something inside him, something alive. We had no idea what to make of it but he clearly needed to get to a hospital. So we strap him in and pick him up, and then people start screaming. I glance back to see a beak violently tearing at his flesh from the inside as blood just pours out of him. Look, I’m a paramedic, I’m used to blood, but whatever that was… it was fucked.”  
  
You can see the owl finally break through, his flesh almost snapping like a rubber band as the feathered thing erupts out of him and spirals into the air. A shower of blood sloughs from its feathers and sprays everyone nearby. It fumbles in the air, struggling to fly until it finally gets its bearings and is gone.  
  
The camera then zooms into the gore that once had been Mayor Bently’s stomach. Some kind of hellish prolapse out of a horror movie. His body literally shredded from the inside out as the bird birthed itself from his corpse. Maybor Bently lay pooling in his own blood.  
  
The whole thing took minutes.  
  
From Dad’s report. “The coroner concluded that the owl was the cause of death, unsurprisingly. But it is the how that is far more confounding. Footage indicates it was a smaller barn owl. Far too big to have somehow been ingested. A 12-inch bird does not fit within a human body. Thus the bird clawed its way out. I have talked to several ornithologists in the weeks following, none have even begun to suggest how such a thing could have happened.”  
  
The feds soon took the case off Dad’s hands but they didn’t have any more luck than he did. The case is solved, death by eruptio noctula, erupting owl, yet no one has been able to explain why. The most prominent theory is that it’s something like spontaneous human combustion, a glitch in reality, an error that makes something impossible happen. I don’t know if I like that explanation or what it implies.  
  
If it wasn't all recorded on video it would surely be explained as mass hysteria. If it wasn't for the fact that the Mayor’s back didn’t have a scratch then the theory that the owl flew through him might have some merit. There are plenty of theories, not even about the cause of the death. That it was an assassination or a suicide. Still, I’ve yet to see anything that adequately explains how something like this could happen.  
  
That’s how I planned to end my article, it really was. The fact I’m posting this here of all places is because of what happened next. During my research, a woman reached out to me saying she knew what happened.  
  
I was obviously intrigued, there were plenty of theories but no one had gone out of their way to tell me one.  
  
When a stranger asks to meet with you, you say no. When a stranger asks to meet you in a well-lit busy cafe of your choosing, well… I said yes. I’m not an idiot, my dad’s a cop, I know how these things can go, but I’m also a journalist and sometimes risks need to be taken.  
  
It was Angelina, the woman who had called the ambulance. She was older yet remarkably the same as on video. I recognized her immediately. Apparently, she did so too, considering one of the first things she said to me was “You look like your father.”  
  
I will not transcribe everything that happened. You may hate me for it, for withholding the answers you so crave. But sometimes ignorance is bliss. A bliss you can never get back once it is torn from you.  
  
In short, she confessed, it was she who had conjured that owl. While that may sound ridiculous, believe me when I tell you I know it to be true. Her words were no mad ravings, they were calm and collected, they spoke of horrifying experiences I did not dare imagine.  
  
A witch, she was a witch. Such a silly word in the world we live in. All meaning and power behind it is shrouded by cartoons and caricatures. Yet Angelina was a wise woman, wise to things best left in the dark. I can tell you that because she gave me the spell she used.  
  
It sits on my shelf now. I’ve only read it the one time. The otherworldly vocalizations and material components are best not kept rattling around in my head. But I will guard it, as Angelina said, “There will always be a man in power that must be put in his place.”  
  
As for her fate, I don’t know. I have not reported my knowledge to the police, not only for the fact Mayor Bently paid his due for what he had done in my opinion but also because no one would believe me anyway. As far as I know, she is still out there. I can only hope she's using her knowledge for the betterment of the world. God knows how much damage she could do if she wanted to watch everything burn.  
  
I can only hope one day the world we live in does not require people to take justice into their own hands. But until then, Angelina is there. I am there. And we are legion.
