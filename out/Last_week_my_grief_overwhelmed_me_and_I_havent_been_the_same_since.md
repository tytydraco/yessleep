Dusk was illuminating the kitchen with an orange hue as I stored leftovers in the fridge. The glistening vodka caught my attention but I resisted the urge, and slammed the fridge shut. I snapped the dish towel from a drying rack, and furiously cleaned the countertops. After that ordeal I made my way along the darkening hallway. I stopped about halfway to peer trough the window and gazed upon the backyard. I could still see the doghouse behind overgrown grass. This gave me an urge to get fresh air.

First I had to sweep away the mountain of envelopes that had accumulated in front of the door. With a wide motion I stuffed them under the drawer. Next I had to find a key for the deadbolt. A framed photo caught my attention while I was rummaging around the table. It evoked a distant memory that i’d rather not relive. I turned the photo to face a wall. Soon after that I found the key neatly tucked in an embroidered pouch.

The outdoor light turned on as I stepped into the cold air. A light breeze swayed vegetation around and all I could hear was the rustling of leaves. Nature had almost complete devoured the footpath connected to the main road. 
This deep into the woods light pollution is low so the night sky is clear. Though it was still too bright to see the cosmos, and when it got dark I didn’t enjoy being outside. The thought that someone could see me from the shadows but I couldn’t see them always raised hairs on my back, besides the cold started to sting my skin.

I made sure to lock the door and hurried to the bathroom. Heat from the shower first felt like a burning sensation on my skin but subsided as I warmed up. The hot water flowing reminded me of bodily contact for as long until the heated water ran out. After that I brushed my teeth. Same mundane rituals. Nothing really different about that evening except the bedroom felt more isolating than usually. I cradled myself in a blanket, and  arranged the many plushies I had around to form a sort of barrier. Then I caressed each one with the same level of love and attention. To some it may seem childish but for me it truly gave comfort. 

I flicked the nightlight on and closed the curtains. The veil of darkness swallowed the room except for that little light. I imagined it as a star clinging onto energy surrounded by ever expanding darkness. How insignificant I felt in that room. It was not uncommon for me to have thoughts like these at night.

Slowly my limbs got heavier and heartbeat slowed. Sleep was coming regardless of my troubled psyche. 

Im half asleep when I hear the sharp clicks of nails hitting the tiled floor. Approaching from the doorway moving slowly towards the bedside. This filled me with a warm sense of nostalgia that was cut short when my hands started to sweat, as if my nerves reacted faster than my mind. One realisation occupied my mind.

“Rex was euthanised six years ago”
