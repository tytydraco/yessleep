“We turn the lights off on All Hallow's Eve.”

It was the first thing that my Grandma Margaret said when my parent's car pulled away from the ancient stone house. Their muffled argument carried over the engine, and they must’ve thought that they could finally run through the process of divorce without me overhearing, but whispers carry in old houses, and now they’ve left me in the oldest one in the county. It loomed large above me, three stories with three gables in the shape of a ‘T’ that faced out into a wild bog.
        
Grandma caught my stare as she unlocked the door, “Another set of rules at my house Jack -” She grabbed my head and softly turned it toward a massive oak whose branches snaked gnarled and heavy over the grounds, their weight held up by several large pillars of granite. It was hard to tell if the stones had always been there, or if they were placed to support the tree. Grandma pointed a boney finger from there to a mossy black slate bridge that crossed a narrow brook, “- you will not play around that tree, and you will not cross the bridge into the bog.”
        
I looked up to her and nodded and she turned and entered her house. I noticed a bundle of twigs wrapped in twine that leaned against the porch and I took it in my hand. The slender sticks wound their way into one another, woven like a single thread that had knotted itself together.
        
“What’s this Grandma?” I held it out for her as I stepped into the cold entryway. The air was still, and the walls pressed in against us. She snatched the wad of wood away from me with a sharp glare.
        
“There is no shortage of stories about boys named Jack doing things they shouldn’t,” Grandma sniffed the bundle and gestured for me to follow her down a narrow hall past diamond paned windows that faced the yard. The kitchen was a sunken stone room dominated by a hearth on the far wall. It was claustrophobic with cookware and clutter, and a heavy wood table sat in the center of the room under chiming pots and pans. It didn’t look like it had been updated in two hundred years. “This is from Joan, she’s a *neighbor*.” She held the sticks between two fingers, her tone dripping with distaste. I wanted to ask about it, but Grandma threw a stack of old newspapers into the hearth. She deftly stacked logs around the yellowed paper, then crossed the room to grab a brown mass that sat on the windowsill.
        
An iron hook protruded from the back of the shape, and she carried it like a lantern. I noticed it had a face. Two hollow holes for eyes, and a gaping mouth with wax dripping down its chin. A stout candle flickered in the cavity behind its eyes.

“A Jack O’Lantern?” I asked. It was smaller than a pumpkin, misshapen, and it flaked like it was covered in dried mud. It had none of the telltale cliches of a carved pumpkin either. No silly face or jagged teeth. Instead it was like a shrunken head.
Grandma smiled and snapped a twig from Joan’s bundle and stuck the end into the lantern mouth. It immediately took to flame, “My Ma always said it was the skull of my Great Grandpa Jack.” She brought the flame to the hearth and soon a fire roared to life. “Truth of the matter is that it's just a turnip. The first turnip our family grew on this land after crossing the Atlantic on wooden boats. It’s been plastered and fired in a kiln dozens of times to preserve it, but maybe my Mama was right-” She flashed me a smile with her tea stained teeth and knocked on the head of the Jack O’Lantern twice. Its yawning face stared at me in a frozen scream. “-Jack’s skull may be in there.”
        
With that, Grandma threw the sticks into the fire and it roared up twice its size, spewing soot and embers across the stone floor. The bundle untangled like worms, and hissed as its moisture evaporated. Then it was ash.
“Why did y-”

Grandma raised her hand, “Do not bring anything you find into this house without my permission. Joan is not a friend of the family. I have never spoken with her about any of my children, nor of you. She is nosey, she insults our family and good folk everywhere with her beliefs. If you see her, ignore her.”
I swallowed my questions.
-

It was easy to settle in during early September while the air was still warm with late Summer wind. When I started Eighth Grade it felt like my life hadn’t changed much.

When the Fall Equinox came around, Grandma took me to the old oak. We laid out homemade candles and carved wooden figurines of humans and animals at each of the stone supports. After the fifth candle, I finally noticed that the seven pillars formed a circle around the tree, and that no grass grew under its boughs, only clover.
“The seasons change, and ghosts walk the earth when it is in a state of transience.”

I always felt stupid when she lectured. Like she was talking in a different language and I could only understand every other word. She mentioned her rules as if they were obvious, and then spoke of things I’d never heard of. I was too intimidated to tell her that I didn’t know what she was talking about.
“October is soon. Get into the habit of turning off all the lights. Unnatural light attracts unnatural things.”
No matter how dim I thought my Gameboy was, Grandma would glare at me if I played too close to sunset. She insisted that candles be our only source of light.

I grew used to seeing her wander the grounds of the house at night with her Jack O’Lantern held aloft.  Then, the night before Halloween, she bade me goodnight after spending nearly an hour outside beneath the oak tree. I was restless, and I floated in and out of sleep as the night grew long, and out of frustration, I sat up on my elbows and looked out my window.

A lantern bobbed within the stone circle under the tree. Grandma doing her rounds of the yard again. I opened the window and poked my head out, listening. The lantern meandered between the granite pillars, and my eyes caught something past the slate bridge. A dozen more lights floated and flickered out in the bog.
*Flashlights?* I wondered.

*“Jack!”* A woman’s voice carried over the lawn. *“Jack! Come here.”*
It was Grandma’s voice.

I quietly pulled on my coat and crept out of the house. The door weighed heavily against me as I pushed it shut, the cold dew soaked through my slippers with each tip-toed step through the grass.
*“Over here Jack,”* Grandma’s voice whispered, pulling me closer to the stone circle.

Her lantern glowed from behind the pillar. I couldn’t see her, but she kept whispering,
*Over Here. Over Here.*

I stood before the ancient oak, just outside the stone circle. The granite slabs towered over me, nearly eight feet in height. The light of Grandma’s lantern started to peak around the corner, and my stomach sunk, like I had just broken something ancient and irreplaceable.

The glow was wrong. Deep and green and swirling, and as it waxed from behind the eclipsing stone, I stared deeper into it. I stepped to the edge of the circle, my toes nearly into the clover patch.
**“Jack!”** An unfamiliar voice rang out behind me.
I tore myself from the haunting glow, and was blinded by a flashlight pointed at me by a middle-aged woman.
At that moment, I saw all the lights in the bog scatter away like UFOs escaping from a black hole. Their tiny torches dimmed faster than I could blink. *Fireflies?* I thought, but deep down I knew that was wrong.

“Jack, I’m your Granny's neighbor. Get yourself away from that tree!” Joan said, pulling a necklace with a purple crystal bound in wire from her nightgown.
I was about to sprint back to the house, when I caught an aquamarine aura creeping behind my back. A shiver ran through me, as something rested its hands onto my shoulder.
A gentle voice whispered in my ear, *“Thank you for your offering.”*
I craned my head back and the glow suddenly extinguished itself.
“Begone beast!” Joan spat out before her flashlight flickered and the bulb burst in a small explosion of sparks and glass.
A voice from the tree rumbled, “No.”
Joan’s face contorted in terror as her necklace was ripped from her throat and shot past me. A moment later, something invisible grabbed ahold of her nightgown and she was yanked off her feet and pulled screaming into the stone circle.

***“Jack!”*** The Grandma’s voice cried out again, and it was as if I was being drawn by an unseen force. My legs moved on their own, unsuspecting of the danger. My heart drummed in my ears as I tried to listen out for Joan.
I tried to make out the source of the voice as I walked across the lawn but darkness ate away at the emptiness in all directions.
Empty except for one, solitary, blue light that I followed.
My feet clomped against the black slate as I crossed the small bridge out into the open bog. I felt myself go white. Grandma told me never to set foot on the bridge.

Croaking frogs and singing crickets echoed through the fens. Eventually, I reached the source of the light. It hung in the air like a flaming vapor, thin clouds of luminescent fog curled inward like arms calling me to follow. The word wisp came to mind.
*This is why Grandma didn’t let me near the bog?* My thoughts were slow and dulled, as if they were being dictated to me. *It looks harmless enough. She really needs to stop treating me like a thumb-sucker.*

The wisp swooped across the air and hovered just three feet from the ground, and a spectral voice filtered through its condensed vapors, *“Hello Jack. It’s nice to meet you.”*
I jolted back a step and that unseen force seized my muscles again. “How do you know my name?”
*“We’ve heard you and your grandmother talk from afar. Your head must be spinning right now.”* It whipped around with a sharp jerk left then right, and my eyes trailed after it like a hypnotist’s watch. *“Your parents are not getting along it seems.”*
My blood turned to ice. The wisp could only have heard about my parents while they were arguing in the car.
Instead of floating like a kite in the wind, the cloud began to whorl around in loops. It didn’t move with grace but instead in stutters and stops. Mesmerizing nonetheless.
*“I can solve all of your problems if you just follow me down into the bog.”* The living flame skimmed the water in a calculated arc, tapping the surface and leaving behind ripples before scattering off into the night.

“Hey, wait! Come back!” My body suddenly was released from the hold and I took off in a sprint toward the apparition. I yearned for my parents to be happy again. I loved them both and wanted to go home with them instead of stuck here with Grandma’s superstitions.
As I carried on, the slate path from the bridge gave way to tall reeds and muck. The longer I pushed onwards, the more my shins began to burn. The ghost giggled, stooping down abruptly to touch the water just out of my reach. Mud cakes stuck to the soles of my slippers and slowed me down.

*“Keep following!”* The spirit called once more in a haunting, high pitched voice. *“I want to help you!”*
As I chased the sprite in front of me, a pit of dread began to form in my stomach. I ran, just as much by my own volition as by the will of something unseen. *Should I be doing this?*
The path twisted between stale bodies of water, before it led into a grove of trees. I paused before it, the moon did not penetrate the darkness beneath the branches. Grandma never said anything about this place. She never thought to tell me what was beyond the bridge.
The voice sang, *“Come! Come Jack!”*

I realized then that it no longer spoke with the voice of my Grandma that had lured me from my bed, but instead, with Joan’s, or at least some mimicry of both.
My feet moved independent of the terror in my heart. Footsteps followed me, but my head would not turn back to look at what trailed behind. In the darkness of the grove, I saw faces peering from bushes and branches. Small ones, fair and cruel, and curious. It reminded me then of the stories my Mother told me of the *Fair Folk* before my Father told her not to tell me fairy tales. She said never to speak their name. I didn’t believe in them until now, when one of the far faces pulled itself from behind a tree. She was small, maybe two feet in height, and completely nude. I was fixated on her, hypnotized completely by the contours of her body and the way her skin shimmered despite the darkness. Gold eyes pierced through me with an otherworldly gaze, and without me realizing, she had reached into my pocket and taken out my Gameboy.
*“What is this?”* Her voice was like wind rustling in the forest.
I reached for it, and as she pulled away, I heard the sound of it turn on. 

An electric light bathed her face, and she stared up past me, dropped the Gameboy and ran deeper into the grove.
The wisp returned, hanging just in front of me, bobbing up and down like it was breathing. Then I was deafened, a screech rang out through my ears and I stumbled forward finally free from the spell. Something sharp caught the back of my shirt, tearing it as I ducked beneath branches and over roots, into ankle deep mud as the thing behind me lashed out.

It wheezed and hissed at my heels, but it kept getting caught by branches and bushes as I squeezed through tight spaces. When finally, I wore out, I turned and pressed my back against the roots of an overturned tree and saw what hunted me.
The creature was abnormally tall and disproportionate. Its face was shrunken, gaunt, and frozen in a look of agony. Its gray skin hung in wrinkles over thin humanlike bones. Its arms reached down below its knees almost touching the ground with fishhook talons. The wisp hung above its head, and I noticed that the vaporous light was attached to the creature by a long tendril of bone. Like an angler fish, it had been luring me into the bog. I froze with fear and trembled as it stalked closer.

Then I heard a lively hobbled gallop through the muck behind the creature. I recognized the gait the moment before Grandma burst into sight with her Jack O’Lantern held high.
The wisp creature twisted and swung its long arm toward Grandma, but she ducked and side stepped the blow. I didn’t know she could move like that, and suddenly she was at its flank and shoved the creature with one hand catching it off balance, while the glow of her lantern caused it to recoil.

She chanted in a language I could not recognize, and the creature retreated from her; the glow of the wisp paled as the light in her Jack O’Lantern burned brighter. The creature scrambled back on awkward legs and began to submerge itself into the brackish waters. It dipped lower and lower, and the wisp attached by bone was dragged into the swamp. Grandma chanted louder and with a bang the candle in the Jack O’Lantern burst into a glow of blue flames and the creature gave one last roar that shrunk into a pathetic scream and the wisp dipped into the depths with a hiss like water poured over embers.

Grandma turned to me, and I realized her shirt was drenched in blood. She snatched my wrist and dragged me through the mud.
“I’m sorry! I didn’t-” She let go of my arm and smacked me across the face.
“Do you know where Joan is?” Grandma was breathing down my throat.

“I-She was in the-”
*“Joan is dead!”* Grandma grabbed me again and continued on. “Why do you think I’m covered in blood? She saw you in the yard and decided to help you with her New Age magic rot.”
My heart sank.

“You left the house with a *light*. You went to the *tree*. You crossed the *bridge*.” She rattled off my sins, and each lashed me harder than the last. “A woman is dead, and it may be her fault, but you are not without blame.”
“But -”
“This can wait. We need to get back to the house.”
Tears blurred my vision as we ran back. Wisps floated in the waters on either side of us, and I could see more of the creatures hiding, stalking, like they were ready to pounce but knew better.
When we got back across the bridge, I looked toward the stone circle. Bloody handprints covered the pillars and Grandma guided me wide away from the tree urging me to look away.
She pushed me inside the house and took me to the kitchen. I felt numb and mute, and only the sound of the tea kettle whistling brought me back to reality.

“What were you doing out there?” Grandma spoke gently as she poured me a cup of black tea. The Jack O’Lantern sat on the kitchen table, watching.
“I thought I heard your voice telling me to come outside,” My heart was still pounding. The blood on her shirt was drying brown.
“Why would you think I left the house so late? Why would you bring your toy out there?”
What was there to say? I didn’t know. I didn’t understand. Everything I thought about our world was being flipped on its head.
“Jack,” Grandma said softly and slid sugar across the table as an offering. I spooned it into my tea until it was sickly sweet. “I am hard on you because I care. Because where we live is dangerous for our family.”
“What were those things?” I asked.
A line creased Grandma’s forehead, and she looked older than before, “They are Will o’ the Wisps. *Ignis fatuus.* Fool’s Fire. They want to lead you to your destiny. Some are kind, most are cruel, and the wisps that haunt our family are the cruelest of all.” She gazed at the flame in the Jack O’Lantern’s mouth. “My Great Grandpa Jack should have died long before his time. He had used magic to live long beyond his years. He had my grandpa when he was ninety-one, well after his fourth bout of illness.”
“You said Great Grandpa Jack-”

“Great Great Great Grandpa Jack to you.” Grandma corrected.
"You said he used magic to live longer?"
“I didn’t stutter,” She sipped her steaming tea.
"And so we're cursed?" I sounded out my words carefully.
"All of mankind is cursed. The *Good Folk* don't die, not the death that we do. They live on as whispers on the land. Lights in the sky. The warmth of candle light and the feelings that you have while walking alone in the forest." She rummaged in a drawer beneath the table and pulled out a narrow tallow candle and held it to the ever burning flame in the Jack O’Lantern. "Those creatures that attacked you, the will-o’-the-wisps, they’re here to correct the fact that our bloodline was born on borrowed time. Jack lived too long, and everything he did with that time, including having children, is considered time owed to the *Fae*. Our destiny should be owned by them, and instead we flaunt our freedom.”
“Am I cursed?”

Grandma’s smile barely crossed her lips and she handed me the newly lit candle, “Only if you think taking care of the land and giving offerings to the *Fair Folk* in exchange for living this interesting life is a curse. Every little offering and sacrifice is a down payment on our lives. Honestly I think the *fae* prefer it this way, though they’d never say. No, you are no more cursed than your mother or I. But, from here on out, you need to listen to me. Artificial lights enrage them, so they *must be turned off*. Tomorrow is All Hallow’s Eve, they will be stronger and more numerous than they were tonight. When you go to bed, put this candle by your window, it will keep you safe and secure.”

My thoughts were reeling. Tiny people and will-o’-the-wisps; fairies and monsters in the bog. Phantom voices and invisible forces. Destiny and magic. The way Grandma looked at me made me realize that she didn’t know how very little of her world I understood. My mother told me about fairies in passing, and I had read *Grimms’ Fairy Tales* in school, but I didn’t know what happened on our family’s land. It may have been my mother’s duty to inform me, but in truth, she hardly ever spoke about Grandma when we weren’t visiting.

Grandma told me to wash up and go to bed. I placed the candle on the windowsill and I listened to the strange howling of beasts across the bridge as I fell asleep.
–
The next morning,  Grandma Margaret directed the police to where Joan’s body was. Candles were burning at every pillar beneath the tree, and as she guided them under the oak, she kept the Jack O’Lantern in her hand.

I heard the police from my window,
*“Wild dogs . . . Bobcats . . . Gutted . . . Hands ripped off . . . Liver removed.”*
I couldn’t help but think that this was my fault.
“Joan was skeptical. She was nosy.” Grandma told me over breakfast.
“Is that why she was out there?”

Grandma sipped her black tea, “She could have thought you were one of the Good Folk. They don’t wander onto her land, perhaps she saw you in the yard and went to speak with you.”
That didn’t sit right with me, “I think she was trying to protect me.”
“Probably. Not that she could protect anyone with those crystals.”
Without the lights on, the house was dark during the day. Uncommonly so. Clouds hung in the sky, heavy with the threat of rain. Grandma had me lay flowers and wood carvings at the bog bridge while she placed candles that she lit from the Jack O’Lantern in every window.

My hand rested on one of the seven stone pillars, just beside the dried brown bloodstain of Joan’s hand. I cried myself silly thinking of that poor woman who had tried to keep me from going under the tree, only to spend the last few moments of her life pressing her hands to the granite in some attempt at leaving her mark on the world.
Grandma watched me from afar, before returning to work placing offerings across the property.
Then something clicked.

Joan had lost her hands, and Grandma was covered in blood when she found me.
I shivered.

*How did Joan’s handprints get here?*
We ate dinner in silence at four in the afternoon. Through the diamond paned windows, I watched the Sun fall closer and closer to the bog. Shapes twisted in the dark places that the Sun could no longer kiss, and the shadows grew long on our lawn. Grandma busied herself with whittling runes and laying iron nails on thresholds. I watched her work, numbed to it all. I think she was finally realizing that my mom had told me nothing of her upbringing here.

“It's time,” Grandma finally said as the Sun touched the horizon. She handed me a wad of sticks wrapped in twine, just like the one Joan had left on our front porch weeks ago. “Light this with your candle and set it in the hall outside your room. Then *lock your door.”*
I held the bundle like a snake. Sunlight rippled green and orange on the surface of bog, and the great orb looked like it was melting and turning into a wisp. “Are we going to be okay?”
Grandma grabbed my shoulder, “This isn’t our family’s first Halloween. But I need you to promise me something, can you do that?” I gripped the sticks tight and nodded. “Nothing you hear is real. Even your eyes may deceive you. Do not leave your room.”
I did as she said. I lit the wad with my candle and it smoldered like a stick of incense and I set it just outside my door. My lock clicked and I sat on my bed.

Then I heard the most peculiar thing from down the hall.
A phone dialing.
Then the ringback tones as my Grandmother called someone.
Her voice was muted through the walls of the house, but I could hear murmurs, “ . . . feeling down. . . trick or treating . . . I’ll see you tonight.”
“Grandma?” I called through the door. Her creaking footsteps went down the stairs, and I received no answer.
I resolved to grab a school assignment and sit beneath the window and read by candlelight, like I had been thrust back in time. My eyes strained as I read, *Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon.* Line by line, until I drifted off to sleep.

*I dreamt of my mother giving birth. I saw a baby bathed in blood be given over to a tall handsome man. I dreamt of knives and drummers. I was at a concert, and my Grandma Margaret was on stage singing in that strange language. I danced to the music. The crowd was brimming with people smiling, but I couldn’t recognize a single face, and they all started humming and like a tidal wave their voices rose into screams. I screamed too. Primal and ceaseless and the drumming pounded like a heartbeat. I was holding a purple crystal wrapped in wire and Joan was beneath the ancient oak tree, her feet and arms were tied up to the branches above and she danced like a marionette. The crystal burned in my hand, and an electric surge shot through my veins until I couldn’t bear it. I threw the stone at Joan and it struck her above the eyebrow. Crimson blood flowed down her face, and then the wound glowed with the aquamarine aura of a wisp and Joan locked her eyes on me and her countenance transformed into the mummified Jack O’Lantern face and in my Grandmother’s voice she uttered,*
***“FEED ME MORE.”***

I woke with a start. The candle above me flickered wild shadows across the walls, and my heart was thrumming. It took me a second to calm myself when I realized the sound of drums from my dream persisted.

There was music playing outside and the sounds of a crowd chatting and laughing. I shot to my feet and looked out the window. Hundreds of shapes were milling about in the lawn. Women walked in fantastic ballroom gowns, and children ran to and fro with glass orbs of every color over their heads. I saw people with sheets thrown over them like ghosts and tiny people walking about on stilts. In the shadow of the oak, I saw a dozen dark figures crawling on all fours in a circle around the trunk, and in the low light they seemed to flicker like stop-motion characters. It was the oddest cast of characters I could have imagined, and they all gathered like old friends.
There were torches the color of the Will-o’-the-Wisps burning on the slate bridge, and at each granite pillar. One torch bobbed low across the lawn and I saw that it was the small fairy woman from the grove. 

She was no longer nude, instead she wore a gown of woven vines and bark that trailed in the grass behind her . There was an allure to her, terrifying enough that I wanted to run from the window, but also to jump from it and join her. Her appearance drew the attention of the other ‘guests’ before the haunting sound of a horn rose from the bog.

Five figures stood on the bridge, their arms held skyward, and from them emanated a clattering of shifting stones. The rags they wore were drenched and muddied, and my heart skipped when I processed that there was no head attached to their necks, instead they were held high, shriveled mummified Jack O’Lantern’s that spewed sick light from their chattering mouths.
It was at that moment that I heard the crunching of asphalt beneath wheels. I looked out and saw a car coming up the driveway with its lights beaming. Every figure in the yard turned to the source, and their quiet otherworldly speech went silent. The oblivious headlights cast a pall over the revelers. Their shapes twisted. Their colors shifted.

 The shine went through them revealing wisps of smoke and foreign skeletons crammed into the shapes of mankind. They grew agitated, their shoulders heaved, and the *things* underneath the tree writhed in misery.

“We turn the lights off on All Hallow’s Eve,” I whispered. Their fate was sealed. Grandma had made this clear with our rituals. Joan’s light was why she died. Part of me thought this interloper should have known better. How dare they come onto this land on Halloween with their lights ablaze. Then I recognized the car.
My dad got out and cast a halting glance at the party before he came and knocked at the door.

"Margaret? It's Nathan." Dad studied the crowd as it shifted toward the house with determined but glacial steps.
“Dad?!” I ripped open the window, “Dad! What are you doing here?”
He fell back a step and spotted me, “Jack, what’s going on?”
The horn in the bog sounded again. My pulse quickened. The five figures on the bridge had crossed over into the yard. The revelers crept closer to the house. Beams of light revealed creatures of flesh and muscle and other indescribable shapes that shifted with predatory gaits.

“Dad, get inside now!” I screamed and dashed across the room to my door. I slammed into it, jostling the latch, and when I turned the doorknob my hand flinched away like I’d been burned. I drew away from the door and watched the latch lock itself. I tried the door again and again, my hand would burn, the door would relock, and I’d look down at my palm and it’d be unblemished. “Grandma help! Let me out, Dad is here!” I hammered on the door.

The front door jostled and banged from my dad’s blows and they resounded through the house.

He was yelling, “Is this some kind of joke? Get away from me! Where’s Margaret?”
I hurried back to the window, my dad was bellowing. Two of the orb-head children had taken him by a leg, and an unnaturally tall man with arms that reached close to his ankles took my dad by the armpits. The tall man’s spine grew malformed out from the base of his neck and over his head like a fishing rod with a glowing wisp hanging from the end. *Just like the bog creatures*, I thought.
*“Thank you for coming, Nathaniel.”* The small fairy woman stood directly before my father.

His struggles ceased and he went quiet as a spell fell over him. Dad was dragged to his knees beneath the granite pillar that was painted with Joan’s blood. At every other pillar stood one of the headless beings with their chattering Jack O’Lanterns chanting a warbling song.

“Dad run!” I yelled, but my voice was lost. All the revelers hummed along and the world vibrated.
Our front door opened quietly, and Grandma stepped out in an iridescent white gown. This time she did not hold her lantern out in front of her, but instead she mimicked the headless figures and held her Jack O’Lantern above her head and approached the circle.
The creatures and fairies of the bog scowled but parted from Grandma’s light. She then stood before my Dad and the elegant fairy woman just on the edge of the clover patch where the dozen dark figures rolled and clawed at nothing.

*“Two bodies in two nights.”* The fairy said. The pieces flitted into place for me. They already considered my dad dead.
“Luck,” Grandma Margaret replied. “Bad luck for some.”
The phone call was to my dad.

*“You insult us with your malshaped charade,”* The Fairy scowled. *“You carry Jack’s head, what is rightfully ours, and you mimic our Diviners. How long will you persist with this?”*
Joan was a sacrifice. I had unwittingly exchanged her life for my family’s bloodline.
“For as long as you take my offerings.”
My dad isn’t Margaret’s son. He is not part of our bloodline.
*“Your bones are old. You don’t plan for us to eat them.”* The Fairy’s voice was cracking ice and sunk cold into my blood. I wanted to slink under my covers and box my ears and pretend this nightmare was over, but I wanted to get my dad away from them before they took him forever. *“There are seven pillars and five Diviners. I know you plan to be the sixth, and when you steal your death from us and join them, do you plan to let your kin die?”*
“No, we will continue.”
I tried to fit through the window. I wanted to jump and save my dad, but an unseen force kept me at bay. My body disobeyed me and kept me in the room.
*”Who then will be leaving offerings? Your daughter, or the boy Jack be giving more?”* The fairy’s golden eyes pierced me from across the lawn.

An offering from me. An offering now from Grandma.
“Let’s not speak of the future,” Grandma Margaret’s tone was final.
*“Very well,”* The Fairy grabbed a tuft of my Dad’s hair and yanked him back into the stone circle.
Bedlam was unleashed.

**“No!”** I screamed as the strange beasts beneath the tree pounced on my father. He made no noise as a dozen bodies piled onto him and the sounds of tearing flesh commenced.The partygoers let out a cheer, and the Jack O’Lanterns of the Diviners flashed with deep strobing flames. The headlights on my dad’s car burst and the car horn sang in rhythm to drums as the party launched into the throngs of frenzied bloodlust. People danced and sang. Colors melted and clashed. Bodied twisted and spun. I was compelled to move as well. Hollering and screaming. My window slammed shut on its own volition and the candle burned bright and I was pulled out of the madness. My bedroom door was battered on its hinges by forces trying to break their way in. Bloody hands smacked the window panes, and I wrapped myself in my comforter on top of my bed and cried.
*“Thank you for your offering.”*
–

I woke in cold silence. I was able to open my door, and the bundle of sticks was just a pile of ash in the hallway.
Grandma Margaret smoked a cigarette while she made tea.
They said that my father died in a car accident. His car had tumbled down into a ravine and he was too injured to get help. His body was savaged by wild animals after he succumbed to his wounds.
That was the official story. But I know the truth.
At his funeral, I overheard my mother thanking Grandma, “-for everything you’ve done.”

I don’t have to imagine why my Grandma called Dad to the house. Divorces are messy, maybe Mom asked for help and maybe Margaret was generous with her interpretation.
I never went back home. Mom sold our house and moved in with Grandma and I. She wanted to make up for lost time and to ‘Better understand her roots.’

Grandma doesn’t tell her everything. Mom thinks the offerings are primarily trinkets and food, but I see the looks Granny gives me. I know she is willfully hiding what true gifts to the *fae* are. Hiding from her that which really buys us time.
I see Dad sometimes in the bog. Watching me mournfully. On Solstices and Equinoxes, he dances below the tree with the rest of the revelers. He seems happy.

Margaret has been sick for years now. She’s left me with her Jack O’Lantern and I’ve taken over most of the strange tasks and duties that were once her responsibility. My mom helps where she can, but I think she has a different destiny than me. When Grandma ‘dies’ she intends to become one of the Diviners that stand sentinel around the stone circle when the world is in a state of transience. The *Fae* will need offerings of life in exchange for protecting Jack’s bloodline.
I know things I shouldn’t know. Jack talks to me through the flames in his mouth when I wander the property. I have memories of the land when it was young. I dream of places not of this world.

All Hallow’s Eve is coming.
