When I was a kid, Grandma's house was my favorite place. Cheap blue linoleum peeling at the corners, garrish floral wallpaper in delicate pinks, the soft tick tick of a cat clock, its tail swinging to the seconds. I went to a friend's grandma's once and that smelled of menthols and hot dogs so I was grateful for mine.

She seemed grateful for me too. Mom and Dad worked a lot so I was dropped off pretty frequently. We were close. One of our favorite activities was to clean the collectibles. She had a whole set of figurines ordered meticulously in a fancy display case of wood and glass. I never seen tiny statues with such realistic detail. A small brown dog in the middle of scratching his ear. A teenager dressed in a pizza delivery outfit holding three boxes in his arms. A small brown bird, wings half extended in flight. There were historical figurines too-- a woman with long braids from the '60s. A farmer still dressed in early 1900s overalls, and my favorite, a king with a magnificent robe billowing behind him. I once asked her who the sculptor was with such talent, but she only smiled and patted my head. 

The years went by and while I got older Grandma seemed timeless. I started wearing baggy pants and knee-high socks. I mastered the flute well enough to be second chair and managed a decent enough SAT score to attend a local public university. But I still went over to her house three times a week, studying in that warm sunny kitchen to the tick, tick, tick of the cat clock's tail. I would type on my computer and she would drink her coffee and we'd sit in comfortable silence.

 But like all change, that came to an abrupt halt on the most boring of Tuesdays. Like many college students I had a clunker car and that Tuesday it would not start. This was a fairly frequent occurrence and I had the bus schedule memorized so I rode it to the closest stop to her house, and I walked a mile and a half from the bus stop. To this day I will never understand. It was Tuesday. It was 3:00 in the afternoon. The sun was shining. There was no reason for something bad to happen. The neighborhood was decent. I'd seen a few people watering their lawns. But all of that couldn't help me. Something bad happened to me. I don't want to talk about it. Afterwards, I finished walking to Grandma's in a confused state. I knocked on the door and when she opened it and saw me the smile on her lips slipped away. She knew.

That Tuesday, that unjust Tuesday, when I stepped through the door, something changed. There was electricity in the air, a sweet sharp hum and it vibrated around me. I could feel it pushing away the fog, replacing my fear with anger. My grandma took me into her arms, a deep warm hug. She whispered only two words. "It's time." I felt a tingling sensation in my scalp, slow at first but intensifying. I could feel something sliding out, I could hear tendrils softly scraping against each other, vibrating, ready to defend. My grandmother whispered, 'No one will ever hurt you again."
