Despite being an extrovert all my life, I live far out in a mountain range in a northern state. I moved here recently, and unfortunately for me, this is currently against my will. Long story short, I'm a part of a witness protection like program, and my “name” (fake for obvious reasons) is Margaret Harrison. Over the years, I have switched companies a few times, but my career has been consistently as head of marketing.  Now, however, I. Do. Nothing. That isn't entirely true. I do the same stuff online, but it's mainly referring to other people's work, and in return, I'm set up with this cabin. 

I have no neighbors, and I am about a 45-minute walk from the nearest town.  My current job requires me to work online, and living only 30 minutes away from the nearest cell tower has allowed me to be in such a remote location. 

It's only been about two weeks since I moved into my new house, but… I've been seeing them for almost a week.  I guess “seeing” isn't accurate. THEY have been lurking around my home for about a week. I haven't seen them, but I KNOW they're there, just out of sight. I'm not… I'm not crazy, I know that. I just haven't SEEN them yet. 

At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but now I can't keep brushing it off. After the third day of noticing them, they had just become an annoyance. It was just small things at first: footsteps behind me, the constant feeling of being watched, even things on my porch slightly moving. Now, however, those small annoyances have actually started to affect my day-to-day life. Now, the things on my porch that will be moved around or hand prints in my windows during the morning fog, and the occasional flash of movement outside of my window. 

It's strange, being alone in the woods, in complete isolation. Last night, I could have sworn that I had seen someone on the porch. With a mug in hand, I went out to cheeks. Of course, I didn't see anyone, but the empty porch didn't provide me any comfort. I climbed into bed shortly after but struggled to fall asleep. 

I saw it shortly after I woke up. The entirety of my porch was moved. I don't think you understand. When I say the entirety, I mean everything that was bolted down was moved 5 inches to the right. EVERYTHING. When I looked out the kitchen window, I was confused, but I continued making coffee. I went out to enjoy it in the early spring air when it hit me. The chairs were the first thing I noticed. They were in the wrong spot. These were not light chairs either; they were sturdy and, to be frank, heavy wooden chairs. I probably wouldn't have noticed it if it weren't for the support beam that they normally sat just to the right of it. It didn't stop there. The plants, the solar lights, the really heavy frog statue that I can't even pick up. They were all moved. It was weird; most of these things were heavy, at least too heavy for the mind to move. 

I want to restate that I have nowhere to live and live far out from any towns. WHO MOVED MY STUFF? See, I knew I had to have been losing it, so imagine when I realized how consistent they were with the movement. I wish I could say I went back inside, leaving it there, but that would make me a liar. I went into the garage and dug out an old tape measurer and wanted to cry upon the realization that everything was exactly 5 inches to the right. By the time I was done, my coffee was cold, resulting in half a cup of coffee going to waste. THANKS A LOT, WHOEVER DID THIS.

Despite my best efforts to keep truckin' through, they just keep getting to me. I’m not even scared of the supernatural or paranormal, just annoyed at this point. With all of my focus being on this, my work has started to decrease in quality. 

I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for, but I need some form of distraction for a solution. Something, even if it's just writing to keep myself from losing my mind.
