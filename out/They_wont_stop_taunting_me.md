Despite being an extrovert all my life, I live far out in a mountain range in a northern state. I moved here recently, and unfortunately for me, this is currently against my will. Long story short, I'm a part of a witness protection like program, and my “name” (fake for obvious reasons) is Margaret Harrison. Over the years, I have switched companies a few times, but my career has been consistently as head of marketing.  Now, however, I. Do. Nothing. That isn't entirely true. I do the same stuff online, but it's mainly referring to other people's work, and in return, I'm set up with this cabin. 

I have no neighbors, and I am about a 45-minute walk from the nearest town.  My current job requires me to work online, and living only 30 minutes away from the nearest cell tower has allowed me to be in such a remote location. 

It's only been about two weeks since I moved into my new house, but… I've been seeing them for almost a week.  I guess “seeing” isn't accurate. THEY have been lurking around my home for about a week. I haven't seen them, but I KNOW they're there, just out of sight. I'm not… I'm not crazy, I know that. I just haven't SEEN them yet. 

At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but now I can't keep brushing it off. After the third day of noticing them, they had just become an annoyance. It was just small things at first: footsteps behind me, the constant feeling of being watched, even things on my porch slightly moving. Now, however, those small annoyances have actually started to affect my day-to-day life. Now, the things on my porch that will be moved around or hand prints in my windows during the morning fog, and the occasional flash of movement outside of my window. 

It's strange, being alone in the woods, in complete isolation. Last night, I could have sworn that I had seen someone on the porch. With a mug in hand, I went out to cheeks. Of course, I didn't see anyone, but the empty porch didn't provide me any comfort. I climbed into bed shortly after but struggled to fall asleep. 

I saw it shortly after I woke up. The entirety of my porch was moved. I don't think you understand. When I say the entirety, I mean everything that was bolted down was moved 5 inches to the right. EVERYTHING. When I looked out the kitchen window, I was confused, but I continued making coffee. I went out to enjoy it in the early spring air when it hit me. The chairs were the first thing I noticed. They were in the wrong spot. These were not light chairs either; they were sturdy and, to be frank, heavy wooden chairs. I probably wouldn't have noticed it if it weren't for the support beam that they normally sat just to the right of it. It didn't stop there. The plants, the solar lights, the really heavy frog statue that I can't even pick up. They were all moved. It was weird; most of these things were heavy, at least too heavy for the mind to move. 

I want to restate that I have nowhere to live and live far out from any towns. WHO MOVED MY STUFF? See, I knew I had to have been losing it, so imagine when I realized how consistent they were with the movement. I wish I could say I went back inside, leaving it there, but that would make me a liar. I went into the garage and dug out an old tape measurer and wanted to cry upon the realization that everything was exactly 5 inches to the right. By the time I was done, my coffee was cold, resulting in half a cup of coffee going to waste. THANKS A LOT, WHOEVER DID THIS.

Despite my best efforts to keep truckin' through, they just keep getting to me. I’m not even scared of the supernatural or paranormal, just annoyed at this point. With all of my focus being on this, my work has started to decrease in quality. 

I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for, but I need some form of distraction for a solution. Something, even if it's just writing to keep myself from losing my mind.



Edit

Hey everyone. I'm still surprised anyone has even seen this. It has been a few days since my last post, and I really appreciate everyone who believes in me. Since I'm alone out here and I'm so far removed from everyone, I honestly needed this. I loved how some of you really started looking into these things on my behalf. I even tried some of the tips you all have left. Unfortunately for me, I haven't been able to see any success. If anything, I think it's getting worse.. For those of you who didn't see my last post, hi, I'm Margrett, and I've been dealing with various strange occurrences in my new house. (Northern mountain range, btw) .No, my main reason for posting last time was that I was stressed beyond belief by the weird stuff that's been happening on my property. I've tried taking longer breaks to relax and meditate, and I’ve even started DOING YOGA EVERY MORNING NOW! Nothing, and I mean nothing, has helped. Sure, my work has improved a bit since I've been taking more breaks to relax, but these problems have just been getting worse, and I'm losing sleep over it. 

The other day, I was doing yard work, mainly just cleaning up leaves. While I was breaking my back over that, any time I looked away from my barrel of sticks, when I looked back, it would be 5 feet away from me. (I'm not sure what is with the fives, but it's weirdly consistent.t) When I say every time I look aw, ay even if it's a glance, if I'm not holding on to the barrel itself it's gone when I look back to put sticks in it. This isn't even life-ruining; it's just petty. 

It must have taken me a whole hour longer than usual to clean up the fallen branches around the house.  

The following days weren't any better. Despite working online, I'm supposed to go for walks every day to avoid getting stagnant. I had noticed earlier that morning a few things were missing from my porch. 

  Things on my porch have started to go missing, only to show up on the trails. And I know my things, not just me misplacing stuff and finding it in the woods.

When I went inside, any time I walked past a window, I swear I could have seen them. Their faces this time.  Their uncanny pale faces are only ever out of the corner of my eye.

And this morning, I woke up only to then find a bunch of silhouettes sitting on my porch. I rushed out of my house only to find that they were all gone. There had to have been at least 8 people, and by the time it took for me to walk out of the kitchen and onto the porch, not only were they all gone, no, oh no, I don't even get the satisfaction of hearing them running off into the woods. The closest tree was 8 yards away, and there wasn't a sound or any trace of them being there in the first place. I was so close to catching them. I swear that I'm going to lose it.
