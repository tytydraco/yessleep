I don't blame you if you don't believe in my story. 

There are too many self proclaimed testament stories of people talking to a God of their personal religion.

And all of them are probably horse shit.

But I promise you that my story is not anything like that. 

I don't even know if the creature I talked to is a God, but it's hard not to describe it as such.

But for the sake of my sanity, I will truthfully say everything that happened to me.

It started when I was sitting on my couch. I was playing with my newly  bought Rubik's cube while pondering how lucky I am to be part of the most intelligent animal species on this planet.

"I have an average Intelligence, but atleast average human IQ is above and beyond compared to the intelligence of other species in the animal kingdom."

In that moment, I felt a jult of pride and superiority.

Ive always felt insecure about not achieving much in life and now I have to compare myself to an animal to feel better about my self.

I was 30 minutes in, trying to solve the cube and I still haven't finished a single face.

"How ironic, here I am, masturbationg on the thought of my intelligence."

" I bet a dolphin could solve this cube faster than I can, if it had hands"

I thought to my self.

And then suddenly, I felt a presence to the left side of my living room. 

My kitchen door is slowly being opened.

"That was weird, I just broke up with my ex and she left my house 2 weeks ago, Did she come back to get something?

Then I saw it, a tall purple skinned humanoid creature. It was bending and peeking at me.

I felt an intense shock and wave of fear and anxiety all throughout my body. The feeling of complete paralysis from pure terror is something that will always stay with me forever.

I would rather go cave exploring than experience that again.

The creature bent over and walked inside the living room and I saw its full, terrifyingly, glorious and beautiful form.

It had a bulbous round head, with triangular pyramid shaped eyes littered all over. Each of it's Iris had a different color, and I swear some of those  colors have never been discovered by humanity before.

Now I am an atheist but at that moment, I immediately assumed that it was an unholy demonic entity sent by the mythical devil itself.

It had 3 long arms on each side of its body, almost touching the floor. Each hand have 7 long fingers and 3 thumbs, no nails. and shockingly enough, it had 2 legs and each foot had no toes.

"This thing, it has a purpose for being here, and I don't think it means well"

The extreme terror and cortisol release felt like needles are scratching on the veins of my heart  And the paralysis, freeze response felt like I was buried in dried cement.

The purple skinned entity started making it's move by walking so unnaturally towards my book shelf. The thing picked a plethora of books at once with it's multiple hands and it started turning pages on all the books with its dexterous fingers. It's eyes started moving in a rapid manner.

"This fucking creature is reading"

Now I am no intellectual but those books are mostly about Science, history, novels, mathematics, philosophy, astronomy, comics, manga and old porn magazines.

The Rubik's cube fell off my hands. And it looked like no recent intelligent life form had tried to solve it due to its chaotic color pattern.

The creature immediately looked towards my direction, as if it did not have eyes on the side of it's head that was already looking at me.

At the bottom of its face, a line started to form, and yes it's a mouth and it grinned. It's teeth are emerald colored and all of them look like different shapes of sharpness.

At that point, I was close to passing out but surprisingly I didn't, maybe practicing stoicism and mindfulness breathing is starting pay off.

Out of nowhere, courage came up to me and I asked the creature what it wants.

Creature: " Ccc, Cu, buh"

I did not hesitate, I immediately threw the cube at it and the creature started to laugh like a child, it's voice sounded like it was in reverse of an audio record.

The thing solved the toy in 4 seconds. Followed by an immediate sigh and an expression of boredom.

At that point, I felt like the creature is harmless and I started to ask it questions.

"What are you?"

Creature: "life from the beyond"

"Where is that?"

Creature: "Can't explain, It's like human explaining universe to ant"

"Try me"

Creature: "the beyond is bigger than this universe, bigger than this reality, More complex, more dangerous."

"So are you an alien life form?"

Creature: "alien in human language means other beings in other planets or galaxies, Me not from this reality, therefore I am not alien. The closest to describe me in your language is God"

"A God huh? Why do you think you're above us? I mean you're incredibly smart. You learned our language in 5 minutes and you solved the Rubik's cube in like 4 seconds but you're still an organism right?"

Creature: " Correct, I am organism, my species adapted and evolved and procreated, for trillions of years in your human time measurements"

"So you're not a god"

The creature started laughing.

Creature: "each human contains approximately 86 billion neurons inside their cranium, that amount of complexity is equivalent to a single cell in my body."

"Alright, you're beyond my comprehension, but why are you here?"

Creature: "Exploration and survival, our species shrank our ourselves to survive and avoid a reality ending catallclysim in our dimension and we want to know how far we can explore towards the lower dimensions."

"I probably won't comprehend this reality ending catallclyism even if i ask..So ill ask another question instead...Why not go to higher dimensions?"

Creature: "the same reason why ants can't explore space. It's simply beyond our capabilities."

"You said your species shrank yourselves, how big were your original self?"

Creature: "Imagine your sun as small as a single cell in my body, that big."

"Woah... So what will you do now?"

Creature: "my species will learn everything about this dimension and after that, go explore towards lower dimension."

"Will your species, reveal yourselves to humanity? You revealed yourself to me...Maybe show us the way to a higher understanding of physics? How about giving us the blue prints for nuclear fusion?" 

Creature: *laughs hysterically*

Creature: "my species is scattered from all over this dimension, I am the only one of my kind in this galaxy. And no, I will not teach your species anything. For a good reason, Species vitality."

"Bullshit! What the hell is that? We are dying of climate change, we need radical tech to solve a God damn extinction level threat.

Creature: " species need to fall and learn from their own, if a species is worthy, their survival is guaranteed, that is the rule for every life in every dimension."

"well It's worth the shot asking...We're so doomed.... Anyways what will be your most important message to my species?"

Creature: "Keep exploring everything."

At this point, the creature pulled out a glowing, shapeless and morphing object from thin air and multiple tentacles of mixed colored light that came out of it and it started whipping and bending the space and time around the creature.

I can only described the visual of the scenario as fracturing and slicing through reality.

The creature, in a mere moment, blinked out of my vision.

Our interaction was only under 10 minutes, It was short lived but my life will never be normal again.

Was the creature a God?  It's hard not to think so. 

But to me, the creature is just like any other organism, no matter how big or small, No matter how smart or dumb...

We all simply want to survive.
