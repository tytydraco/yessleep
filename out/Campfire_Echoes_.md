The fire cracked and popped, casting faint light across the group’s faces. We were huddled close, warding off the creeping chill of the bush. The night was still, the kind of quiet that made you second-guess every rustle in the scrub or splash on the lake’s surface.

We’d been here for hours, telling stories, as we always did. Every year, same spot, same faces, same ritual. Sam, the self-appointed ringmaster, was grinning as he finished his latest yarn. It was a load of nonsense about a bloke finding a woman’s reflection in his bathroom mirror that wasn’t his own. The group laughed nervously, the way you do when you’re unsettled but don’t want to admit it.

“Alright, Joel,” Sam said, leaning back and stretching his legs toward the fire. “You’re up. Haven’t heard you spin a yarn all night.”

I shifted on the log, staring into the flames. I didn’t usually tell stories, and they knew it. But something about the night made it harder to resist.

“Fine,” I said, adjusting my jacket as the firelight danced over my hands. “But this one’s true.”

The group groaned, and Josh tossed a stick into the flames. “They’re always true. Just tell us, mate.”

I smiled faintly, glancing at the shadows stretching long across the ground. “This happened a few years ago. I used to work at this industrial dump site. Grueling shifts, dust everywhere, bloody suffocating heat. The worst of it was this old conveyor belt we called Conveyor 48. Thing was a hundred meters long, creaking and moaning like it was alive. And it was always breaking down, always needing a clean.”

“Doesn’t sound scary yet,” Maya said, smirking.

“Wait for it,” I replied, my voice dropping slightly. “Me and my mate Madox got stuck cleaning it one day. Just the two of us, the whole shift. Down in the guts of the thing, where the trash smelled like death and the air felt thick enough to choke you.

“We joked around to pass the time, but Madox kept glancing over his shoulder, like he was waiting for something. I didn’t think much of it at first—Conveyor 48 gave everyone the creeps. But then we heard it. A sound, faint at first. Scratching. Like claws on wood. And the trash… it moved.”

The fire crackled louder, as though to punctuate the words.

“Moved how?” Anna asked, leaning forward.

“Like it was alive,” I said, staring into the flames as if seeing it all over again. “We tried to laugh it off, but it got louder. Closer. Then something started charging up the belt toward us—fast, too fast. We ran. Had to. I made it out. But Madox… he didn’t.”

The group was silent now, their faces pale in the firelight. Even Sam had stopped grinning.

“That’s it?” Maya asked, breaking the quiet. “You just left him?”

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. “I didn’t have a choice. They never found him. No body, no sign of a struggle, nothing. Just… gone.”

“Hang on,” Josh said, narrowing his eyes. “Where was this?”

I hesitated.

“Yeah,” Sam chimed in. “What kind of place has something like that? You’re not making this up, are you?”

I looked at them, my face tightening. “I’m not. It was real. I worked there. At Conveyor 48.”

The campfire seemed to dim as the words hung in the air. The group exchanged uneasy glances.

“Shit,” Maya muttered, hugging her knees.

I forced a chuckle, though it sounded hollow. “Don’t worry, that place is long gone. They shut it down not long after Madox disappeared. Too dangerous.”

Josh was about to say something when a sound interrupted him—a faint voice, drifting across the lake.

“Joel…”

My blood turned to ice.

“Did you hear that?” Maya whispered.

The voice came again, clearer this time, a low, guttural call.

“Joel…”

My head snapped toward the lake. Ripples spread across its surface, black and oily under the starlight. Something broke the water—a shape too large to be a fish, its form shifting and wrong.

“Joel…” The voice grew louder, and I stumbled to my feet, my chest tight.

“Madox?” I whispered, the name slipping out before I could stop it.

The others froze, their eyes darting between me and the lake.

“What the hell, mate?” Sam said, his voice shaky.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. The shape was moving closer now, rising from the water, its limbs too long, its face twisted and unrecognisable.

“Joel… I’m still here,” it said, the words bubbling out like a wet rasp.

The fire hissed, the flames sputtering as though the air itself recoiled.

I stepped back, my boots scraping against the dirt. “This can’t be real,” I muttered, shaking my head. “It can’t—”

“Joel!” The voice was a roar now, impossibly loud, filling my head like a thunderclap.

And then it was gone. The ripples stilled, the voice silenced. The campfire burned steady once more, as if nothing had happened.

The group stared at me, their faces pale and slack.

“What the hell was that?” Josh finally asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

I didn’t answer. I just sat back down, staring into the flames, my heart hammering in my chest.

But deep down, I knew the truth.

Madox was still out there. And he wasn’t alone.

The fire continued to crackle, though it felt distant, muted, like the world had shifted around us. The group sat frozen, barely breathing, the weight of my story still hanging heavy in the air.

Then we heard it.

Not the voice again—something worse. A wet, sloshing noise, faint at first, like something being dragged through the undergrowth. It grew louder, closer, wrapping itself around us like an invisible hand squeezing tight.

“What the hell is that?” Josh whispered, his voice trembling.

No one answered.

The sound was everywhere now, impossible to pin down. Something primal and cold bloomed in my chest, the kind of fear that doesn’t give you time to think—only to act.

I bolted.

I didn’t warn them, didn’t look back. My legs moved on instinct, tearing through the bush as fast as they could carry me. Branches clawed at my face, the darkness swallowing me whole, but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t.

Behind me, the dragging noise grew faster, more erratic. And then the voices came again.

“Joel…”

They weren’t just calling my name this time. They were laughing, a guttural, choking sound that made my skin crawl.

The ground beneath me turned uneven, roots and rocks threatening to trip me with every step. I pushed harder, my breath ragged, my chest burning. My boots slipped on the wet earth, but I caught myself and kept running.

And then, just as suddenly as it started, the noise stopped.

I stumbled into a clearing, the pale light of the moon casting an eerie glow. My chest heaved, my pulse pounding in my ears. I stood there, frozen, the silence pressing down like a weight.

“Joel…”

The voice came from behind me, soft and familiar.

I turned, and there he was.

Madox.

He stood at the edge of the clearing, his body twisted and wrong. His eyes burned like embers, and his mouth stretched into a grin that was anything but human.

“You left me,” he said, his voice a low rasp.

I couldn’t move. My legs were leaden, my body refusing to obey.

“Madox…” I managed, my voice cracking. “I didn’t—”

“You left me,” he repeated, stepping forward. His movements were jerky, unnatural, as if something else was pulling his strings.

The sight of him snapped me out of my trance. My legs finally listened, and I turned and ran, the underbrush tearing at me as I pushed blindly through the trees.

The voices followed me, growing louder with every step.

“Still here, Joel…”

I broke through the treeline, my foot catching on a root. I hit the ground hard, but I scrambled back up, refusing to let the darkness claim me.

And then, suddenly, there were lights. Flashing red and blue. The harsh bark of voices calling out.

The red and blue lights flickered through the trees, strobing the darkness and painting the world in surreal flashes. My legs gave out as I stumbled into the clearing, collapsing to my knees on the muddy ground. Voices followed—the sharp commands of the police, the low murmur of radios crackling in the still air.

I didn’t hesitate. “They’re still out there!” I shouted, my voice hoarse. “You have to find them!”

Two officers approached cautiously, their flashlights cutting through the night. “Mate, slow down,” one of them said, crouching in front of me. “Who’s out there? What happened?”

“The others!” I gasped, gesturing frantically toward the trees. “Maya, Josh, Sam—they’re still out there! Something’s after them!”

The officer’s brow furrowed, and he glanced back at his partner, who was already speaking into his radio, calling for backup.

A paramedic arrived, draping a blanket around my shoulders and guiding me gently to the back of the ambulance. I sat there, trembling, as the officers and emergency crew fanned out, their flashlights bobbing in the darkness.

The minutes stretched endlessly as I watched them search.

Finally, the lead officer returned, his face a mask of confusion. “We’ve looked everywhere,” he said, his voice carefully measured. “We couldn’t find anyone else. Just you.”

“No!” I snapped, lurching forward. “That’s not possible. They were with me. We were all here!”

The officer exchanged a glance with his partner before crouching down again. “Alright, let’s start from the beginning. How many people were in your group?”

“Four of us,” I said, my voice trembling. “Me, Maya, Josh, Sam.”

He nodded, jotting notes into a small pad. “And their last names?”

“Maya Fitz, Josh Campbell, Sam Weller.”

The Officer walked a few paces back towards his vehicle, sitting inside the front passenger seat of the already blinding blue and red lights continuing to beam off and on stating to any onlookers that something is going on.

Slowly returning the officer paused, his pen hovering over the page. “Fitz, Campbell, and Weller?” he repeated, his tone uncertain.

“Yeah,” I said, blinking at him. “Why?”

He sighed, shutting the notebook with a soft snap. “There’s no one in the database with those names. Not in the area. Not anywhere nearby.”

“That’s not possible,” I said, my voice cracking. “I drove here with them. We set up the campfire together. Look, their stuff must still be here!”

The officer’s face darkened. “We found your car,” he said carefully, “and we found things at the campsite—enough for one person. There’s no sign of anyone else ever being here.”

The words didn’t make sense. They couldn’t.

“No,” I whispered, shaking my head. “That’s wrong. You’re wrong. I’m not crazy—they were real! I can describe them! Maya, she had brown hair tied back in a ponytail. Josh had this stupid shark tattoo on his forearm. Sam, he…” My voice faltered as I tried to summon the memory.

The details began slipping away like sand through my fingers.

“Maya’s voice… it was…” I stammered. “Josh… he liked…”

The officer’s gaze softened, his voice quieter now. “Joel,” he said. “Are you sure you weren’t alone tonight?”

I stared at him, my mouth opening and closing, but no words came.

Then, from somewhere deep in the bush, a sound echoed—a wet, sloshing noise. Faint, distant, but unmistakable.

“Joel…”

The voice slithered through the air like a whisper wrapped in razor wire. My heart stopped.

“Did you hear that?” I asked, whipping my head toward the trees.

The officers exchanged uneasy glances.

“There’s nothing out there, mate,” one of them said, his voice steady but lacking conviction.

But I knew better.

The paramedic gently placed a hand on my shoulder, guiding me back into the ambulance. As the doors closed, shutting out the flashing lights and murmuring voices, I was left with one, undeniable truth.

The voices around the fire. The laughter. The stories. They weren’t real.

The monster had followed me from Conveyor 48.

And this time, it hadn’t just taken Madox. It had taken everything.
