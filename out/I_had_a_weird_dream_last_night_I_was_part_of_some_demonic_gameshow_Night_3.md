I don’t know what to believe anymore. I have seen numerous things these past few nights that I just can’t disprove. I don’t know what’s real anymore. How can everything that has happened actually have happened? Why, why did this have to happen to me. I am writing this to help me process everything that I have gone through. All I can say before I start though is I'm sorry…

HELLO ONE AND ALL AND WELCOME TO RAZAROTH’S GAME!! 

Let’s welcome Susan, this week’s returning contestant. The crowd erupted into jeers and booing  as I was thrust upon the stage for my final time. Razaroth like usual appeared behind me and this time was sporting a fine black tuxedo, suit jacket and black rose in his shirt pocket. As soon as he emerged the crowd’s demeanor shifted into applause followed by a moment of silence. Why is the mood so different this time? Before I had time to think the host touched a hand on my shoulder and announced. “Welcome everyone to Razaroth’s Game.” Today is a special day since our contestant has made it to the final round. Not many make it this far, but those that do usually do not finish. Will Susan be one of the lucky few or will she become one of the thousands before her to join us here?” “What?” Is all I could muster, before the host continued on. “Let’s get right on to the meat of it shall we.” A twisted smile contorted onto his face. 

The stage lights one by one turned off leaving us in complete darkness for a brief moment. Before a single pillar of light erupted into the center of the stage where the host and I were standing. Then one by one the lights turned back on and in front of us was a koi pond. Jagged stones pointing this way and that. A large roaring waterfall rushed into the main part of the pond, but the water wasn’t water. It was blood, and on the surface on the blood were a few dozen tiny wooden row boats with people on them. Baring the waves as a large koi fish jumped out of the pond and caused a tidal wave. The tiny boats bobbing up and down and some of them capsizing in response. Tiny little lives snuffed out in an instant, as the koi fish swallows them up one by one. 

Somehow this wasn’t surprising anymore. I looked over at the host and asked, “Is this how we are selecting the game this time?” He looked annoyed either at my lack of enthusiasm, my question or maybe both. He didn’t respond, instead I just got a net thrown at me with a quick thumbs up from the hands atop his head. It doesn’t seem like I’m supposed to catch the koi fish, all the other games have made me have to pick from multiple fears. “I guess the answer is obvious then.” I walked to the edge of the pond and looked at the remaining row boats left from the fish’s destructive path. There were maybe half a dozen left at this point. Hurriedly I gripped the net tight, got as close to the edge of the pond and readied myself. Swinging my net I tripped into the pond and started to sink.

Dark blood surrounded me as I thrashed about in what seemed like an endless void. I couldn’t see anything, but I could hear rushing all around me. All I could do was swim upwards as I struggled to make any headway. All the while the sounds around me, growing louder and louder. Until something grabbed my leg and started pulling. A bony hand dug into my leg and refused to let go. Panic overcame me as I gasped and drank in the blood. The taste of iron caught in my throat as I threw my limbs every which way. All of the movement in the blood attracting its master. The koi was directly under me now, I was going to be its next meal. The current suddenly got even stronger as I was pushed backwards. The koi was swimming straight up getting ready to jump.

The pressure increasing every second until *SPLASH* I was thrown out of the pond. Drenched to the soul I lay on the ground in front of Razaroth’s feet. He bent down and grabbed the skeletal hand that was still rooted into my leg. With a sharp twist it came right off and he tossed it off to the side. Then without skipping a beat grabbed me by shoulders to get me to stand up on my own. “I guess I still need to pick my fear, let me go grab my net.” However before I could turn around Razaroth shook his head and pointed at the hand. 

Slowly it started twitching, starting at the fingers. Pulsing, thuming to life as tendons and muscles started to form. The bone breaking and expanding to grow into an arm. Shooting into a ribcage as a sinew and organs start to burst into life. Blood starts flowing out, but the skin hasn’t formed so this abomination shrieks in pain from its newly formed lungs. As the limps started to form it slowly started to crawl towards me. All the while a pained blood curdling scream coming from the loose, flapping vocal cords. The muscle continued to form up into its head to form its face and empty eye sockets. Slowly skin started to sizzle onto it as its eyes formed and I was for the final time sucked into the dark room to start my third round.

The walls of the room fall around me and form into the surroundings. An enormous coliseum forming around me. White marble walls, with gold trim. The stands filled with the audience members and in the King’s box, our host. Razaroth now in a toga with an ivy crown. Grapes being fed to him by another abomination. Skin pulsing, muscles twitching, bones twitching. Almost as if it was being puppeteered by something. However as soon as Razaroth noticed me, he rose, demanded silence and made an announcement. “Welcome my loyal servants to the final round of my game. For we have an absolute treat today. Susan here is tasked with a simple task. Kill her doppelganger!”

“You will be given 5 minutes to prepare and select your weapons.” Weapon racks surged from the ground on command. “Do you have what it takes to kill a person Susan? Nevermind yourself?” Appearing on his head between his two extra hands, a sign counting down the time popped into existence. Surrounding me are blades, shields, spears, daggers, but there isn’t any armor. There is almost any weapon you can imagine, but nothing to protect yourself with. “Looks like nothing has changed.” I muttered to myself as I grabbed my selection. A bandelier of daggers, a broadsword with its side sheath and a light weight, but sturdy shield. Looking up at Razaroth I had about a minute left so I stood off to the side and tried to ready myself for what was to come. 

“5,4,3,2,1!” The crowd shouting out as the clock struck zero and the ground started to shake. The previous flat ground started to twist and rise. Deep sinkholes formed with magma spitting out of them. Trees sprouting up as a river follows down and forms a waterfall. Bits of each mixed together. Biomes that just shouldn’t exist forming before my eyes, as trees catch fire from the magna. The rumbling comes to an end and an eerie silence overtakes the air. I have two choices from here. I can wait here and maybe think of a plan or I can go looking for my “doppelganger.” The nerves get to me as panic starts to set in. What the hell am I doing? I can’t kill someone…can I? As a blade swung down next to my arm missing by a hair, my choice was made for me. In front of me was a 5’4 black haired male. They had brown eyes with a cleft chin and smaller ears. A normal build for just your average person. Someone who I thought I wouldn’t have to look at anymore. Especially not like this.

“Why” is all I could muster, wiping the tears from my eyes. They just kept swinging as I ran away. Getting closer and closer as I jumped into a bush and slid down a cliff. My left shoulder brunting most of the impact. Looking up they continued down the path trying to find a way to get to me. Brushing the dirt off I sprang to my feet and ran in the opposite direction. I need to figure out a plan, I can’t just let them catch up to me again. I ran towards the flaming trees, the fire engulfing them into a large blaze. I started cutting any branches that I could, gathering a pile quickly to light aflame. One by one I light the branches and start spreading the fire as far as I can until I am surrounded in a half circle of flame. Time to find my doppelganger before they find me. I walk back to the cliff where I fell, sword clutched in my hand.

Scanning the area, I don’t hear or see anything. “I just need to make sure I don’t fall into their trap. If I can do this, I can make it home…right?” Slowly I tread back towards the flaming trees, ringing in my ears made it almost impossible to hear anything. The sound of the fire was gone, the sound of the rushing water, the magma spitting out, nothing, “Oh, no.” I had to find them now. “COME AND GET ME!” I screamed at the top of my lungs. “I can do this” repeating over and over in my head. Suddenly a shadow appeared in the brush to my left. Slowly moving my eyes followed it until. *SLAM* They were behind me, not in the bushes. I rolled wildly back and forth trying to throw them off. With some luck I slipped a dagger off my shoulder and stabbed into their arm. They twisted off, contorting in pain allowing me to get to my feet. I ran to the ring of fire, my doppelganger following behind throwing a fit. This was my last chance, I dove in, grabbed the remaining sticks and grew the fire as large as I could, encircling us. 

They followed me in, screaming out as the flames touched them. I threw another dagger, it landed in its leg. A loud scream pierced so loud that it counteracted the ringing in my ears. However they didn’t flinch back this time, they lunged forward swinging wildly seemingly more like a beast, than human. I held up the shield blocking as many hits as I could. Until it went flying out of my hands and my left arm was cut. The pain was immediate. I couldn't take many more of those, but the fire was starting to do its job. I was starting to get light headed from the smoke. Slicing back with my blade I cut at its leg my sword getting stuck. This just angered them more, and I had to hurry to grab another dagger. It was immediately smacked from my hand and I was knocked back onto the ground. I had to grab another, panic filling me once again as my hands fumble on the clip of the bandelier. My doppelganger limped directly in front of me and pointed its sword at my throat. As it went to swipe at my throat I kicked the sword in its leg cutting through the rest of it. They collapsed as I crawled to the edge of the fire. I got up enough, coughing at the smoke and got ready to jump. A hand grabbed my leg for the second time today and I fell into the flames

I kicked at their hand over and over as the flesh started to bubble. Its grip loosened and that gave me just enough leeway to get out of the fire. Rolling around in the dirt to put myself out, all I could smell was my flesh. Searing pain washed over as I looked over at my doppelganger. They were flailing around on one leg, inhaling smoke, falling over and burning alive. I waited for what felt like hours until finally. “We have a WINNER!!!” Darkness engulfed me and I was transported back to the stage for the final time. I was propped up by a tiny cloaked figure next to Razaroth. My wounds still stinging and a good amount of my skin burned off. “So what now?” I barked. “I played your game, I completed all three rounds. NOW WHAT!” Razaroth simply pointed at an arcade cabinet. “Choose your Character!” showing up in huge letters on the screen. “I thought I was done playing your game? Now you want me to play another one?” He didn’t say anything, just continued to point at the arcade cabinet. The tiny cloaked figure walked me over to the machine. A joystick and a single button was on the front. As I approached the title screen changed and the character select screen appeared. When I went to look at the characters everyone just said “random.” So much for being able to pick. I selected random, the selection wheel spun and Richard Carlson was selected
