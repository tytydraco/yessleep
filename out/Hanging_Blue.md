I’m a gamer, and no. Not one of those popular gamers who has millions of followers. I’m a simple high school student, gaming to escape the harsh reality of our world. I recently got a Pokémon game from my sister for my 15th birthday. I had to admit, the game wasn’t the most interesting thing ever created. It was called Pokémon Blue or whatever. If it wasn’t for my extreme obsession with Pokémon, I would have sold it. But hey, even if this game was old, it could have potential.

The game cover had a blastoise on it. Blastoise was my favorite Pokémon. It was just so cool and exciting. It makes sense since I have adored all its evolutions. I took the game cartridge out of the container it was in and got my Game Boy out. My Game Boy was a bit dirty and scratched up. But whatever, I turned my gameboy on and inserted Pokémon Blue. After it was inserted, the game's intro played. The

Intro was in black and white, and it started with Gengar and Jigglypuff somewhat.

"Fighting," I suppose you could call it. Gengar would try to hit Jigglypuff, and then Jigglypuff would dodge, soon leading to the iconic intro. With the massive Pokémon logo and trainer holding a pokeball with Squirtle beside him.

I let out a sigh as I pressed the new game option. Professor Oak appeared on screen, explaining all about Pokémon and whatever else. I skipped most of the dialogue; it was pretty boring stuff that I’ve seen in many other Pokémon games, old and new. Finally, it asked for a name. I looked at the name options and attempted to pick a new name, however. I guess the game thought I picked Blue. Due to my name instantly changing to Blue. I was confused, definitely confused. If that was even the word..I shrugged it off though—old games like these always had malfunctions. Finally, I got to the rival part. I decided, just for the hell of it, to choose Red. It made sense anyway. After that, I got to my house. Everything around me was blue, besides my body, which was red. I walked around the room, just seeing what things did and what did not. Finally, I went downstairs.

It was like a kitchen, all colored blue too. I walked over to "mom," and she talked about how all boys leave home some day. Once she finished talking, I walked outside. I walked outside to the grass when Professor Oak caught me. He said wild Pokémon lived in the grass, and I needed my own Pokémon to protect myself. Soon, Professor Oak walked away, and I quickly followed after him, walking to some type of big building.

There were a few people in the building. But I kept following Professor Oak until I got to a place with a familiar person. Could it be..Red?

Red turned to look at me, then back at Professor Oak. "I’m fed up with this waiting!" He exclaimed. Crossing his arms. Professor Oak would ignore Red and immediately talk to me, saying there were three Pokémon on the table and I could have one. I just needed to choose. I nodded and walked over to the table. Choosing squirtle. Red walked up and quickly grabbed the pokeball with Charmander. "I choose this one!" Red said, and soon turned to me. "My Pokémon looks stronger." I ignored him and walked away. Until Red followed after me. "Hey! "Wait, Blue, let’s test out our Pokémon; what do you say?" I said yes and followed him outside. He brought out his Pokémon, Charmander. And I sent out Squirttle. Red’s Charmander used scratch, and my Pokémon used tackle. After a bit of fighting, I won. Red was angry and said he’d make sure his Pokémon got stronger.

I walked out of the building and went into the tall grass and fought pidgey. It was really easy to defeat, and I would then walk around for a bit, talking to people, fighting, and so on. You know, casual Pokémon stuff.

I went to the Pokémon Center to heal my Pokémon, and I saw Red. I was majorly confused—what was he doing here? I don’t think he was supposed to even be here. Red walked up to me; he had a pokeball in his right hand. "Well, hello, Blue." His expression quickly changed, from a huge smirk to a bit of a frown. "We should battle, one last time." "I know you hate me, so let’s get this one last battle over with." I was, to say the least, really confused. Was this coded into the game? Or did my sister buy a hacked game or something? Out of confusion, I opened my computer and looked up a gameplay of Pokémon Blue. To see if what I was seeing was coded or hacked. But right when I was about to open my computer, an alarming sound came from my Game Boy. It sounded like a scream of something. I turned to look at my game, and Red and I were outside the Pokémon center.

How the fuck—how did we get out here? I was questioning everything when Red started to talk. "Hey, blue, are you in this battle or what?" "Don't leave me waiting here." Out of panic and confusion, I just pressed the yes option. "Well, then what are you waiting for?" "Pull out your blastoise or something, and I’ll pull out my Charizard." I nodded and pulled out my blastoise. As he pulled out his Charizard.

So far, the Pokémon battle was going fine. Until Red’s Charizard did one move, causing my blastoise to faint. I sighed and went to pull out another Pokémon. But I wasn’t able to. All my Pokémon somehow fainted. But that couldn’t be right! I was just at the Pokémon Center! Red turned and smiled. "Guess I win Blue." But I shook my head and said, "No, you don’t win, Red!" Red suddenly grinned. "But all your Pokémon fainted." "How could you possibly battle me now?"

I didn’t know what to do, and he was indeed right. How could I battle him now? Wait, wasn’t there a run option? I looked at the buttons, and indeed there were. "Well, blue. "How will you fight me now?" I pressed the "run" option. And said, "I won’t." Red screamed, "What?!" As I was running, Red chased me. I ran into tall grass and found a stick. Red was still chasing me; he looked pissed. I then picked up the stick and ran back to Red. He looked confused until I pushed him on the ground and stabbed him repeatedly with the stick. He screamed and kicked me, trying to stop the stick from stabbing him even more. But it was no use, his eyes would get taken out, and soon would some organs. After what seemed like forever, I stopped stabbing him. And looked down to see a dismantled, ruined corpse of what used to be red.

I got up and grabbed onto Red’s dismantled dead corpse. Dragging it to a huge oak tree. And finding a rope, tying him up by his neck. I then got rid of the stick and grabbed Red’s bloodied bag. Pulling out his pokeballs and potions, and putting them in my bag. And walking off.

I turned off the game after that experience. And went to sleep for the night.

The next day, I turned my game on again and got the same intro. Nothing seemed to change, and I just went back to my save file. I was inside my house, and the room looked again, normal. I walked around and then went to the TV. Where a news broadcast came up. "Red, a Pokémon trainer, is found dead hanging by an oak tree. People have claimed he committed suicide for private reasons; others think someone killed him. "But no evidence has been shown to support that claim." I turned off the TV and slowly walked downstairs. "What have I done?" "What have I done?" I said to myself, walking out of my house and going outside to see Professor Oak.

He looked upset and held Red’s bloodied bag in his hands.

"Hello..Blue. You must have heard the news about Red, yes? He supposedly killed himself yesterday, and someone stole his Pokémon and valuables. Or maybe he got rid of them, but that isn’t like Red at all! "He adores his Pokémon too much!" Professor Oak let out a sigh. "Maybe the kid was going through stuff he never told me about..but…if you ever find his Pokémon, please give them to me." I nodded and walked away, guilt creeping up my back.

Red died because of me, and it was all my fault. Yet nobody knew what had really happened yet. What a terrible act. I walked through the tall grass and found a Pokémon trainer looking to battle. It was a guy; his hair was messy, and his shirt was striped. I looked through my Pokémon and noticed all of Red’s Pokémon. I thought, "Why not?" And chose Charizard. But I instantly froze. When I called out Red’s Charizard ard it didn’t look right at all! As a matter of fact, its neck was broken. And its eyes and organs were torn out..just like how Red looked when I murdered him. The guy with whom I was battling took notice of this and ran off. Why... was this happening? I ran off to my house again and into the bathroom.

Their was a mirror in the bathroom, as well as a shower and toilet. I went to the mirror and washed my face. Looking back up to see my reflection. I looked worried, which made sense. I just..kept staring in the mirror until something popped up. My hands started to twitch. The thing in the mirror was Red. All ruined looking, and hanging upside down. I panicked. And punched the mirror. The glass went into my body and onto the floor. AAAAAAA- I screamed and run downstairs to find a bandage or something. There was no bandages in sight….I ran outside, soon hearing a voice in my head. "Check..the…tree.." "The tree, THE TREE." SHUT UP!! I screamed and ran faster, soon falling onto the ground.

I looked up, and saw the same oak tree where red was hanging. But wait..why..was there- more ropes..? I got closer, and saw all of my Pokémon hanging on the tree, organs ripped out….neck broken. What…? I was confused and kept looking at the tree and ropes. And that was when I saw an empty hanging rope. Where red was supposed to be. My eyes narrowed, and I soon heard laughing behind me. I turned and saw…Red.

He was back to normal, no organs taken out…nothing. I turned to him and tried to grab onto him. Until I went through him. And that’s when it hit me. I stared back at the tree, and saw my own self hanging. It wasn’t Red who was there.. I soon got the perspective of myself hanging from the tree, Red was just laughing…and laughing. That’s when he turned and smiled at me, walking away with my now bloodied bag. And the same bloodied stick in his hand. That’s when I realized, that the whole time…when I thought I killed Red…it was..actually me. Who died.

I quickly removed the game from my Game Boy and threw it across the room, soon stomping on it and smashing it to pieces. I’m never..messing with that again. And that was the end of that. At least, I thought it was…
