My parents went on vacation 2 months ago saying they would return a week later…they never came back, ever since that happened this guy took care of me.

He never bothered to tell me his name, or tell me anything about his life, he lives in the middle of the woods the nearest town being 10 minutes away.

He is very old. He is very skinny, almost like a skeleton. His skin doesn't seem right, almost as If he skinned someone and wore their skin. He has black eyes, but they aren't exactly normal when he's alone his eyes turn completely black, and when I make even the smallest noise, his eyes are back to normal. His voice is very soft, deep, and raspy.

Most of the time I wake up to screaming and the smell of ...something, all I could make out of the screaming was "Help". I confronted the guy, he said that it was a bad dream, but I'm convinced that something is wrong.
 
For some reason the lock to my room is on the other side of the door, so he always locks me in my room at night when I go to bed. Everyday I eat this wonderful looking breakfast of Pancakes and bacon, but it just doesn't taste right, as if it's been cooked with rotten ingredients.

My bus stop is a block away from my "home". Most kids don't enjoy school, but it's like a safe place for me, most kids love the weekends, but I dread them.

When I get home the cycle repeats, l've stopped eating his "breakfast", when he's not looking I dump it all in a container and throw it away at my stop, but he's gotten suspicious, so I now throw it away at school, I've heard kids say, "who would throw this away, this is the best breakfast I've ever seen". If only they knew.

I told my teacher all about this and she believes me, and she supplied me with a lock pick so I could escape my room, did I also mention that my windows have metal bars blocking them, like a prison.
I left my room one night with the lock pick, I was walking down the hall, there's this guy screaming bloody murder, and a terrible smell the gets worse and worse every step I take, I go down the stairs, there was so much blood, the guy screaming saw me and said "HELP ME". The old man said "there's no one here to save you, anyways... good night" he proceeded to bash his head in and decapitate him.
The guy who was taking care of me had no head, it was completely blood and skeleton. He was chopping the now dead dude with a butchers knife limb by limb, organ by organ. He told his dead body "don't worry you'll be breakfast" then I realized, HOLY SHIT THIS GUY HAS BEEN FEEDING ME HUMAN.

He gripped his knife harder, as he saw me. After he saw me he said,”Go. Back. To. Sleep.”
