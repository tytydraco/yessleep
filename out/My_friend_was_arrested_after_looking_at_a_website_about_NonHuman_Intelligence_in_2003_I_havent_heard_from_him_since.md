Samuel was a long-time friend of mine I met in High School. We loved to talk about mysteries involving government agents, air force pilots, UFOs… that kind of stuff. Then something happened… something that confuses me to this day. It was your average day, back in 2003. Samuel and I were roommates in a basement apartment. I was in my bed, invested in a book when he called my name three times from the living room. He only ever sounded so excited whenever he came across a news article about some mysterious event, so I got up, then sped over to him. He was sitting at his computer, glancing back and forth between me and the screen.


He was on a website featuring a list of blue links along a white background. Each link had a month-year date as a title. March 1984, July 1985, October 1986… He clicked on the one titled “November 1982,” then was brought to a digital copy of a document labeled with the CIA's logo.


Samuel stared at it. “Read it, man.”


The stuff I remember from the document are as follows:


“On September 1, 1959, a dark sphere was spotted 25 miles off the coast of Florida. The object began emitting a red glow. Then yellow, blue, orange… it then accelerated upward at ninety-degrees…”


A CIA article about an official UFO encounter? There was no way this was real. This document had to have been fake. Peaking at the website's name, well… all I can recall is it was something along the lines of InterceptionGov.com. I asked Samuel if this was a website for conspiracy theorists.


“Not at all.” He clicked back to the main page, then clicked the link titled “May 1984,” which brought him to another digitized article. "Read this one too!”


This is all I can recall from the article:


“(sometime in the 1500s, I don't remember the exact date, in a German city, don't remember which one, unfortunately)... ...equipped with two red crescent-shaped transport aircraft… force arrived with their own attack aircraft, also orb-shaped, red, and blue… a large mile-wide spear-shaped aircraft arrived to clean up the debris and recover bodies… no debris or non-human intelligence was discovered by civillians…”


I asked Samuel if this was a website for fictional articles. He gave me a look. “Come on, I need you to read these.” Samuel showed me a couple dozen more articles, his hand shaking as he scrolled through them. One of them had a black-and-white image of a logo. A star with some lines beginning at each point. The lines from the star's top and right-most points intersected, forming a square. Many of the articles covered eyewitness accounts of UFOs from members of the US army and many government agencies. The mysterious flying objects were mostly orb-shaped, square-shaped, tic tac-shaped, or triangular, and these reports came out of many different locations around the world in a variety of contexts such as training exercises, leisure time, wars, etc. Some of the witnessess saw a dark orb hover down into their own backyard...


Some of the other articles went in-depth about extraterrestrial races (one of them was called the Marupan, the others are fuzzy,) the ones likely to attempt to invade us, the ones protecting us, what we called their planets, what they called their own planets, what they called our planet… Planet names were different depending on the perspective of which race discovered them.


There was an article under “October 2000” in which a CIA agent was harassed. Here's what I can recall:


“...As I reached the source of the light, it started blinking. The leaves were being ruffled with, and something was sliding erratically across the pavement. I backed away, then whatever it was under the leaves lunged at me. I turned and ran, with the sound of something rough sliding even faster along the sidewalk. Suddenly, something sharp clawed at my back… …the pain wouldn't cease. A co-operative ran up to me, then his face creased as he glanced behind me… …he shot at the thing eight times before the horrendous sounds it made ceased… …showed there was a purple scar running up my back... ...The pain prevents me from lying on my back… …I'm being told something will happen to my family if I do so much as visit a casual professional doctor. Is my boss part of a CIA Non-Human Intelligence sector or a Mob family?...”


This has stuck with me, whether I believed it was true or not. It was chilling, and at first I thought it was a fiction article written for a website similar to the SCP Wiki.


Samuel showed me maybe a quarter of the articles, going by the fact the links from around 2000-onwards had around 10 articles each, while the ones from prior had 1-3. Although, he only clicked three links from the 21st Century. Every article I read had to do with different races that weren't human and encounters with spacecraft not from Earth. I couldn't understand why Samuel would want me to read them. They were clearly fake, right? I didn't believe in aliens and had heard too many debunkings of UFO sightings to convince me they were real.


When he clicked the link titled “March (or July?) 2003,” he was given an error page. Within the following hour or so, we got a knock on our door. I answered it to find a dozen people in unmarked SWAT gear standing all around my backyard. The one nearest to me told me to step outside. My heart sunk. I don't recall doing anything illegal… I was pulled aside, then cuffed. Many of the agents proceeded to run into the house as the three surrounding me started walking me across my yard. We were approaching two SWAT vans when I heard a bunch of footsteps from behind. I looked back and saw the agents had come back out with Samuel, who was also in cuffs. What could he, of all people, have done? What was going on?


Samuel and I were put into separate vans, then taken to the nearby police station. I was walked into an empty room, then sat down at a table across from a middle-aged man with grey hair. The man asked me a few basic questions about Samuel. None of them were about me, which was relieving. They soon let me out, then drove me back home. As for Samuel, he didn't return that night. Or the night after that… or the night after that. I called him, but he wouldn't answer. I'd email him, but he wouldn't respond. Where was he? What was he doing?


On night nine, I emailed him once more, but his email address was defunct. Weird. I called him again, but somebody completely different picked up and claimed I had called the wrong number… Was he okay? I contacted his parents... they told me he was under investigation, but they weren't told what it was about. I contacted the police. They told me they'd be on the lookout and let me know if they found his whereabouts.


On night ten, I was zapped awake by a stinging pain. Some animal was nawing at my right arm with teeth that felt as if they robotically moved independently from its mouth. The animal would yank my arm to the left, then the right, but its teeth moved in a circular motion instead. I wrestled away until the thing let go, then I jumped out of bed. The animal let out a howl that didn't sound like anything I had heard before. I ran for the door, yanking it open, then getting it shut before that wild thing could injure me more. There was a hard slam against the door. Then another. I reached for my home phone, but it wasn't there. Where the hell did I put it? Another slam and the door made a cracking noise. My stomach sank. I ran upstairs to the exit. As I got the door open, there was another growl, followed by the sound of thin wood being broken, then the sound of paws racing along the carpet. Dread overcame me, then I slammed the exit door shut.


I looked at my neighbors’ house, noticing their bedroom light was still on. Hoping I had enough time to get them to call the police, I sprinted for their house. Not even halfway there, a dark object landed a foot away from me, obscuring my view of the light in the window. I bumped into the object, getting a face full of metal, then fell back onto the grass with a stinging pain. I held my face, then tried to make out what I had just run into. It was too dark outside to make the thing out, but I knew it was metal and able to hover gently to the ground without making a sound.


While picking myself back up, there was a thud against the exit door. I felt around, navigating around the metal object. It was round. I continued on to my neighbors’. I grabbed the fence, ready to hop it, when I was blinded by a flashlight. All these voices began shouting at me. “Stop! On the ground!”


I looked to my right. The light was aimed down, and I could see the silhouettes of I'm unsure of how many people. Once they got to me, I was put in cuffs and brought into the back of a SWAT van. Why was I in cuffs this time? Are they going to capture that animal and take it far away from my property? I did see some rifle-wielding individuals in SWAT gear run by me right before I was cuffed. My heart was racing and none of my questions were answered on the way to the police station.


At the station, I was taken into the same empty room. Instead of being asked questions, I was told, with no specifics, that my home was contaminated and I needed to be relocated. I tried my best to get answers out of them, but they told me again and again they couldn't answer much. My wound was treated, then I was taken to a hotel room on the other side of town.


I had no idea what any of that was about, and I still have no idea. Something is out there, though. Who else was driving that silent hovercraft? The thing couldn't have been classified government tech, as the government wouldn't want casual suburban citizens of all people to see it... and it reminded me of that website. I could never find that site again, no matter how hard I looked. Perhaps that error page wasn't temporary and the site had leaked info. The government must've let me go because revealing to me the website had official info on it would've been more difficult than just letting me believe the site was probably the hoax site anyone would've thought it was. If the site is truly real though, then how did some casual dude access it? It couldn't have been up for long either, at that point. And if I wasn't arrested for potentially having looked at the site I probably assumed was a hoax site, why was Samuel arrested? For all they knew, Samuel was just as likely to have looked at the site. Unless he had something to do with it?


As for that animal... I don't know what to say, other than that I've never been able to find any information about an animal like it and I hope I don't encounter it again.


Since night ten, I haven't been able to look up at the sky. I haven't been able to watch videos about aliens or UFOs (or UAPs… that officially released video of the flying black orb in the Middle East is haunting…) without a sinking feeling of dread about how powerful these Non-Human Intelligences may be and what they could do to us.


Also… to this day, I still haven't been told a single thing about Samuel. I’ve made ten good friends since he was arrested, but there's this intrusive worry I have that I'm just trying to recreate my friendship with him. Wherever he is, I hope he's okay.
