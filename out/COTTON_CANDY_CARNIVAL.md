"Sugaaar. Get your sugar here. The sweetest treat that will ever touch your tongue."

The cheery voice was coming from a food truck selling all types of different candy: licorice snails, cherry lollipops, chocolate toffees, and far more items that I didn't have enough time to inspect as a rough hand was pulling me through the alleys between all the carnival stalls and booths.

"Don't even think about it. You shouldn't even look in their direction," Max mumbled. Max, whose fucking fault it was that I was at this godforsaken place and now he wouldn't even let me enjoy it.

In his eyes, I saw the red and white reflection of the candy truck. But even without looking, all the scents surrounding us were torturing me because I couldn't get closer. 

"Why would you crack your teeth open with those rock-hard candies that have probably sat there for decades when I can offer you the sweetest delicacy in the form of a cloud?" A pantomime mused behind a cotton candy cart that we almost crashed into. Almost as if it had appeared out of thin air. 

The smell of caramelized sugar was even better than anything the candy truck was pushing through its vents.

The young man was wearing the costume of a pantomime in the colors black, white, and purple.  One of his eyes had a big black diamond painted from the bottom of his brow almost down to the cheek. The left eye was not painted but had a singular teardrop underneath. There was a bright grin with paper-white teeth and purple lips painted over his taped-over mouth. Despite it, there was something quite melancholy about him. His green eyes held a hidden sadness.

"How can you speak through that? Is it a recording?" I asked, but Max was already yanking me away from the side. 

I kept walking on but turned my head to look at the pantomime one more time.

"Come back, soon," his voice vibrated through the air. The voice that couldn't have come from his real mouth. 

His head was slightly tilted and stayed glued upon us until more people filled the gap between us. 

"Max, we can't keep doing this. Maybe we should just talk to someone. Maybe someone can explain what this place is," I whispered to my friend as we moved around a woman on stilts who tried to lure us into some tent.

He shook his head.

"Not until we know who we can trust."

\*\*

It all started a few days ago when we saw the posters advertising the End Of Summer Spectacle - a traveling fair visiting our town in the middle of August.  While we both didn't understand why they would name that *the end of summer*, we were still keen to go. We'd graduated a few weeks ago and as we were both staying in town for summer, we'd promised each other to fill it with as many activities as we could.

That's how we ended up at the fair on a regular weekday evening. The Spectacle, however, was a massive disappointment. The few rusty rides, vendors, and food trucks were rather below average. We spent most of our time just making fun of how terrible everything looked and were just about to call it a night when Max insisted on checking out the tent with the tarot card reading. 

"I'm not spending money on some fake ass fortune teller," I sighed when he tried to pull me toward the shady-looking cherry-red tent that had so many patches on it that they almost appeared like a pattern. 

"Come on, Ivy. Don't be a buzzkill," he sighed in response.

"Okay, you go waste your money on that, I'm gonna get some popcorn instead and then we'll meet again in front of the Ferris wheel?" I suggested.

He reluctantly agreed. Separating, however, did not save me from my fate.

--

Max stayed gone for so long that I'd finished the entire bucket of popcorn that I'd initially gotten to share. 

After standing in front of that Ferris wheel like a weirdo for what felt like an eternity, I decided to go into the shabby tent and look for my friend.

Food trucks were already shutting down, one light after the other was switched off at the rides. The bumper cars were all parked and most people had left already when I found myself standing alone, in half darkness in front of the tent.

There was no way Max was still in the tent, I told myself. Partially because just looking at the entrance that was merely a dark blanket somehow made me shiver. 

"Max, are you in there? The carnival is shutting down," I shouted. There was no way I'd be stepping in there on my own, with nobody around and hardly any light if Max wasn't inside.

But to my surprise, I got an answer.

"Ivy? Come in here, you need to see this."

I can't fully explain why I didn't just step inside. Something inside of me was screaming to get the hell away and my mother always told me to trust my gut.

"No, I'm good. Just hurry up," I replied.

That's when somebody tapped me on the shoulder. I turned around and looked into the forest green eyes of a young man, around my age I would guess, dressed in black pants and t-shirt that were both covered in dirt. His eyes were bloodshot with circles around them that appeared almost black. 

In his hand, he held a cone of cotton candy that was so at odds with the rest of his appearance.

"You should go home. The carnival is closing," he whispered with a croaky voice that sounded like he hadn't spoken in days.

"Yeah, I'm just-,"

"Ivy, please," Max's voice interrupted me. His tone sounded more urgent, almost desperate. "I need you to come inside."

I turned to look at the guy with the cotton candy again but he'd disappeared so I sighed and took a few steps forward, but stopped right in front of the entrance. 

I wouldn't go in there, I would just open up the flap of the door so I could actually *see* Max but as my hands touched the fabric, fingers wrapped around my wrist and before I knew what was happening, I was pulled inside and landed right on my knees.

"What the fuck?" I shouted. 

The inside of the tent was far more spacious than it appeared from the outside. Candles were placed all over the ground and on wooden desks and shelves. 

Max was kneeling on a pillow, with his back facing towards me. In front of him sat a person, their face hidden by a too-large cloak.

Neither of them was close enough to the entrance to have pulled me inside and I didn't see anyone else around. 

"Come closer, child," the person, an old woman from the sound of it, instructed.

"No, thanks. I don't want to see my future. Max, let's go."

"You have to see this, Ivy. It's us!" he answered enthusiastically. 

Reluctantly, I took a few steps forward. If only to grab his arm and pull him out but when I saw the cards on the ground, my stomach turned.

The cards depicted us. Or at least, drawings of us. Creepy drawings.

The first one was of Max, recognizable by the ashy blonde curly hair and the exact same Nirvana t-shirt he was currently wearing. He was grinning but there were holes burned through where his eyes would have been. 

The other one was of me. Shoulder-length brown hair. No holes in my hazel eyes but there was blood dripping down my face. Not in the drawing but on the card itself. And my expression was empty. My mouth was open, and black goo dripped down my chin.

Next to it were more regular-looking tarot cards with symbols that I didn't know the meanings of. 

I had no idea how any of this was possible. Had Max shown this woman a photo of me so she could print these cards? It just made no sense. 

"Some believe fate cannot be changed once it is laid down," the voice of the woman startled me.

"How did you make these?" I carefully asked. 

"I did no such thing. I don't choose what appears on the cards. Your fates are bound to this place now, as are all of ours."

She pulled down her cloak and I was surprised to see that she wasn't old at all, it was only her voice. She looked at me with tear-streaked eyes.

"I'm sorry. All I can offer you now is advice. Don't engage, don't consume, don't enjoy. They own a part of you but not all. Stay hidden as much as you can and-" she stopped speaking abruptly, her eyes opening wide.

"Okay, fuck this, I'm done," I mumbled and grabbed Max by the arm. When he turned his head and looked up at me, bile formed in my stomach. My mouth hung wide open when I saw the disfigured face of my friend. 

He looked just like the tarot card. His mouth was frozen in a joyous laugh while his eyes were a mess of blood and goo. Burn marks were forming all over the upper part of his face. 

I blinked once and he suddenly appeared normal again, his expression just as startled as mine. 

He jumped off the ground and grabbed my hand.

"Let's get the hell out of here."

We rushed out of the exit, my mind a disoriented mess but getting out of the tent didn't make things better. 

The carnival was alive. And it was beautiful. 

There was apple bobbing, and bumper cars with kids excitedly shrieking. The Ferris wheel looked twice the size it was before - each seat was adorned with different beautiful patterns in bright colors. People were enjoying crossbow and ring toss games. There were plastic ponds filled with rubber ducks.

And the smell of sugar, caramel, and fried dough filled the whole area. 

We had stepped into the picture-perfect image of happiness and it was simply impossible.

I slowly turned my head to my friend to see if I was the only one seeing this but he seemed just as shocked. 

"Run," he shouted.

Without another word, we simultaneously started heading for the entrance that we came in through earlier but no matter how far we ran, what direction we went in, we couldn't leave. At every corner, the Carnival seemed to simply begin again. The laughter of clowns mixed in with the whimsical carnival tunes followed us each step. 

When my lungs were about to collapse, I fell to the ground shutting my ears with my own hands.

Max turned around when he noticed that I wasn't there anymore. He stopped in front of me, his eyes full of sorrow.

"What is going on?" I cried out. "Am I losing my mind?"

"If you are, then so am I," he mumbled and fell next to me. The other visitors didn't even spare us a glance but I felt the eyes of the vendors on us like glue.

*Don't engage*

Those words kept repeating in my mind and they made me weary of everyone around. We stayed together, alone in our misery, and didn't talk to anyone until the darkness lifted slowly, a hint of the sun appearing on the horizon.

The next thing I knew was that I was home with no idea how I got back.

--

After sleeping almost all day, I'd convinced myself that it was all a bad dream. Until I opened my phone and saw that Max had sent me a photo.

A photo of the two tarot cards depicting our faces. And a text that said, "please tell me you remember last night."

I thought that would be the end of it. A sick glitch that we fell into and would never understand.

Until night came. Because as soon as the sun was gone, my friend and I found ourselves back at the Carnival. Not at the shabby one, that one left town the following day. The one with all the lights, whimsical tunes, and someone trying to lure you in at each corner.

 \*\*

We've been back three more times after the first night. All we do is walk around or try to find places to hide where the light won't reach. All while the eyes of the workers follow each of our steps. We haven't figured out who we could talk to and we haven't found the tent with the tarot reader again.

We've tried to stop it. We burned the cards and left town before night but nothing has worked so far. And nobody would ever believe what was happening because the weirdest part is that nobody notices that we're gone. After the second night, my parents asked me why I was so quiet at dinner the night before and why I went to bed so early. A dinner I don't remember because I consciously wasn't there.

All I remember is the Carnival but I don't understand how I can be at two places at the same time. Is it only my mind that leaves and if so what happens once I do engage?

All I have to hold on to right now is the fact that my friend is going through it with me. But I'm not sure how long we'll be able to keep each other [sane.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/)
