"Have you heard that new song, Charlotte?" my friend asked, disrupting me from my homework. "It's actually really great!"

"Is it the one that has everyone riled up on the internet?" I asked, leaning back in my chair.

"Bingo. Have you listened to it? I think you might actually like it."

"No, I haven't really gotten around to it. I'm too busy to even do my homework." I told him, placing my hand on my unfinished calculus.

"It's only two minutes long!" he groaned, dramatically falling onto my desk.

"Calm down, Yaguchi! You're so dramatic!" I said, pushing his face off of my notebook.

"But Char! Do you even know what it's famous for?" he asked and stood up, accepting his defeat over laying on my desk.

"Isn't a note unrecognizable, or something?" I asked, remembering a short YouTube video.

"Yeah, and no one can find out what it is!"

"That's what unrecognizable means."

"Char!" he exclaimed, shaking my desk. "You have perfect pitch! You can find out what the mystery note is!"

Sighing, I closed my notebook and told him, "Fine, give me your phone."

Smiling, Yaguchi pulled his phone out of his pocket and handed me his headphones from around his neck.

"You and your fancy gaming headphones." I sneered, placing the very good sound quality headphones on top of my ears.

I studied the YouTube video before clicking play. "It's named 'Untitled'?" I mocked, causing Yaguchi to roll his eyes.

The song was relatively normal for the most part. No lyrics and it gave off a very creepy EDM feel. Basically a generic song trying to be a little scary.

I recited the notes in my head. C#m G#m A B F#m G#m Don't know A B C#m. I stopped suddenly. I came across a note I didn't know.

Yaguchi noticed my confused expression and began, "So you found the mystery note, huh?"

Moving the headphones down to my neck, I told him, "Yeah, that's really strange. I could tell every note except for that one."

He placed his elbows on my desk and told me, "It plays 6 times in total throughout the whole song."

Placing my hand on my chin, I added, "That sounds about right for the song's length."

"Does it sound close to anything?" he asked, tilting his head slightly.

"Not at all. It's almost as if it's a new note entirely, but can't be combined with others. That's why the whole song sounds a little creepy, the artist tried to make it sound a bit normal, but it just doesn't work."

"So you can't tell what it is?" he asked once more.

"Nope." I sighed, handing his phone back. "I can listen to it more after school at home, but I can't promise anything."

He displayed a look of disappointment as he placed his headphones back around his neck.

"Oh!" he began, snapping as he remembered. "How's your mom doing?"

"She's doing a lot better." I told him, opening my notebook. "The chest pains are completely gone."

He displayed his usual happy expression, saying, "That's good. I'll have to visit sometime soon."

After writing half of an equation, I heard Yaguchi ask, "Do you remember now?"

"Remember what?" I replied, eyes still on my paper.

"What?" he asked, scrolling through his phone.

I placed my pencil down and told him, "You asked me if I remember now. Remember what?"

He stared at me confused. "I didn't say anything."

"Whatever." I sighed. The last thing I need is to hear voices. However, I was sleep deprived, so it's not too surprising.

The short sound of the bell interrupted my thoughts, but reminded me that the day was over.

"You really should come over to our house." I told Yaguchi as we approached the stairs. "My mom misses you."

He laughed, "Does she really miss me that much? Well, I do have a very charming presence after all."

Rolling my eyes, I jabbed him with my elbow. His laughter quickly became a cry of pain as he clutched his side.

"Are you okay?" I asked, placing a gentle hand on his arm.

"I'm fine," he replied. "It's just that stupid mini flagpole they still have here."

"Wasn't that from the festival we had a few months ago?" I asked, studying the four foot brass beam on its stand at the base of the stairs.

"Yeah." he groaned. "They never found a place to put it so it sits here. Damn, that hurts."

Yaguchi quickly walked it off and we parted ways on the sidewalk in front of the school.

"Are you okay, Love?"

I was snapped out of my quick daze by my mother's words.

"You zoned out for a while."

"Sorry." I chuckled, placing the puzzle piece with its partner. "I'm a little on the tired side."

My mother sighed, "You need to get your necessary sleep. It might affect your music and grades."

"Those have been fine for the most part." I told her as she connected the last piece to form a bird.

"Wow!" I exclaimed, observing the picture before me. "I think that's the fastest we've ever completed a jigsaw puzzle."

My mother turned her wrist to see her watch. "Yep. One hour and twenty five minutes. New record!" She beamed as her gaze followed every delicate line of the pigeon.

"So, mom." I began, brushing some hair out of my face. "How have the headaches been?"

"They're all gone!" she told me, excitement in her voice. "There's no trace of nausea either." 

"That's great!" I smiled, leaning closer. "You might even be able to quit physical therapy sooner if things continue as they have."

"I hope so." she whined. "My instructor hates me. I have no clue what I did to her, but she's so salty."

A slow piano tune emerged from her pocket. "Speak of the devil." she said, phone in hand. "I'll have to go, Love."

"All right." I replied, disappointed. "I'll see you in a few hours." 

"Make sure to disinfect your hand." She pointed to the noticeably large scar across my palm from falling onto a broken jar.

"I will." I assured her.

We met in a quick embrace and she was out the door.

I walked over to the bird we created, attempting to savor the moments with my mother that I took for granted before.

"Do you remember now?"

I yanked my head up instantly, trying to search for the source of the words. My house lay silent, the only sound from my ticking watch.

I buried my face in my hands, assuming it was due to sleep deprivation. I took a deep breath and headed to my room to work on my song.

Yaguchi grabbed a chair from a nearby desk and brought it to the side of mine.

"Did you hear the freaky news?" he asked me, placing a hand on my art notebook, trying to get my attention.

"Regarding that untitled song?" I asked back, giving up on trying to get that assignment done. "Didn't some big YouTubers who mentioned it die?"

"Not only that." he told me, leaning forward in his chair. "Practically all the owners of channels that reuploaded it are dead or missing."

"Holy crap." I replied, trying to comprehend how many people that could be.

"Scary, huh? All sorts of websites are banning it now." he told me. "They say it might be cursed or something."

"That's so strange." I added, looking at his shocked face.

Suddenly, I felt something grasp my neck. I jumped in my seat and clawed around the general area.

"Scared you!" Yaguchi laughed, pulling his hand back.

"This is why no one likes you, man." I told him, flustered.

"And yet, here you are, Char." he replied, aware he won the argument.

I rolled my eyes and went back to finishing the art assignment.

I walked with Yaguchi after class and we continued our previous conversation.

"I considered putting that song on my Instagram story." he told me as we walked up the stairs. "For all I know, I could've died if I did that."

"It's such a weird coincidence." I added. "All those people who died from exposing the song."

"You think all those people died by chance?" he questioned, looking at me as if I was crazy. "There's no way it was a huge coincidence."

"Can we stop talking about it?" I pleaded, uncomfortable.

Yaguchi displayed his usual mischievous grin and said, "So you are scared."

"Be quiet." I joked, jabbing his ribs with my elbow.

Before I knew it, he fell backwards, down the stairs. His head jerked back and landed on the mini flagpole.

"Yaguchi!" I cried, running down the stairs. I tripped on the last step. The pool of red I landed in stained my shirt and hands.

The top of the brass pole tore through the back of his throat and emerged from his mouth. His entire body twitched as water poured from his eyes, mixing with the crimson liquid.

I fell to the ground, my screams filling the halls of the school. Countless teachers and students discovered the horror of the corpse, not moving in the slightest.

"Do you remember now?"

Why was I hearing that damn question at this moment? Perhaps focusing on the question rather than what used to be Yaguchi was better.

I ignored the soft knock on my door, staying still and silent under my covers.

"Love?" I heard from the other side. "I'm leaving your dinner outside your door, okay? Eat when you feel ready."

There was no way I could eat anything. No way I could keep it down. The last time I even ate was the morning before Yagu...

I couldn't even bring myself to say his name. It was ruled out as an accident, but because I hit him with my elbow, he lost his balance.

I felt myself try to cry, but all my tears were gone. I hadn't been this shut in and malnutritioned since I got the call when my mother was sick.

Needing a bit of fresh air, I came out from under the covers. The first thing to greet me was my computer, the holder of all the songs I've ever made. I remembered Yaguchi's excitement when I first told him I made the song he happened to be listening to. 

He always told me that if I ever felt down, to make music if it truly brought me joy. Perhaps I was desperate to feel even a slither of happiness, but I slid off my bed and sat in my swivel chair. After typing the password, known by pure muscle memory, I stared at the screen of my folder containing all the songs.

The song, "Excitement" was made when I got my first phone. I was still an amature at that point, making the song sound really bad.

The song, "Melting Point" was when I attempted to be poetic and tell a story through the changes in the music. I finished it, but it sounds more like a clump of noise rather than a story.

The song, "Untitled" was made recently according to the last save date.

Why did I have a song with no name on my computer? I hit the play button and a familiar melody rang from the speakers. I had heard this before, but I couldn't pinpoint what it was.

I then heard a single note. One I didn't recognize. That popular song that no one knows the origins of and said to be cursed was saved onto my computer.

"Do you remember now?"

The voice had never been this clear before. My head turned behind me and my eyes landed on two white, glowing orbs.

I fell out of my chair in a panic, scurrying to get away from it. At a certain distance, I could see what appeared in my room. Around ten feet tall, a monster stood in my midst. Its entire body was made from a black wisp, forming a slouching figure with abnormally long limbs. The horns were large, resembling an elk, but its most noticeable features were the glowing eyes with a toothy grin to match.

"Do you remember now?" it repeated, tilting its head.

I was too frozen in fear to verbally respond. I shook my head, hoping that was enough to send it back to wherever it came from.

It laughed, the sound resonating in my very soul. "That scar on your hand." it mentioned. "You really think it came from a broken jar? Don't you think it's strange your mother miraculously was healed from her illness as well?"

This time, I didn't respond in any way. I wanted this thing to leave me alone. In a split second, the monster lunged toward me and stopped in front of my face.

"Try to think, you stupid child." it ordered in an angry growl.

Both its voice and face began to ring a bell.

My mother inherited a deadly disease that had no cure. I was devastated when I learned the news. I didn't want her to go, so I got desperate. Slicing my hand open with a knife, I drew a symbol with my blood. At the time, I didn't care what I had to do in order to save her. Even if it meant killing others.

"The mystery note is cursed." I began, staring into its eyes.

"You finally remember." it replied, delighted. "I couldn't save your mother without a price."

"But Yaguchi, he..." I tried to reason.

"Your friend was collateral damage. Live with it, because you brought this on yourself. Live with the guilt of killing all those people for your own selfish desires."

After its final words, it left just as quickly as it came, leaving me paralyzed against the wall. It was completely right. I was selfish and didn't care who I had to get rid of to get what I wanted. All I could do then was stare at the ceiling of my room, mind empty.
