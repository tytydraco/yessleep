Almost like they were posed, the life-sized, ‘Raggedly Ann and Andy’ style stuffed dolls were non-threatening in appearance. They might’ve even been cute under different circumstances. That is, if they weren’t just propped up against trees in the forest, directly behind my house. I was so weirded out by their random, unexplained placement back there that I dragged them, one by one, to my living room to solve the mystery. 

That was my first mistake. 

At the time, I didn’t realize the vaguely human-looking dolls with blank smiles and dead eyes had battery-operated microprocessors to verbally engage their human counterparts. Frankly, I didn’t know what to do with them. I finally decided to sit them upright in chairs as if they were living people. At the time, it seemed the most natural thing to do. As I positioned them like unexpected house guests waiting for tea, I discovered the switch on the left side of each body. As a man of action, I elected to turn them on, to see what happened. 

That was my second mistake. 

Without justification, I hoped answers would magically present themselves as to how they happened to be placed behind my home. I live at the edge of a national forest with so few neighbors that you can count them on one hand. I guarantee, none of them would buy creepy, adult-sized animatronic dolls or abandon them in the woods. I know that. The mystery definitely bothered me but at that point, the feeling was closer to puzzlement than fear. Then they began to speak. 

I’m not sure if they were proximity motion activated or otherwise, but my presence across the room drew their attention. All of a sudden, I wasn’t alone. The three dolls addressed me as if I was a long lost friends of theirs without simulated mouth movements. They spoke with a complex familiarity which suggested they were alive, and we’d known each other for years! I was too bothered by the sophisticated ease of which they interacted with me, to marvel at the disturbing technology behind it. I had to keep reminding myself they were essentially toys. Creepy, life-sized toys. 

Amazingly, they could converse about any topic I broached but deliberately avoided the subject of who left them behind my house. Whenever I’d cornered one of them about it, the other two unblinking animatrons would deliberately intercede and redirect the conversation elsewhere. The AI was beyond impressive and fascinating to witness as they helped each other deflect my prosecutor-like cross-examination. The more I pressed, the more evident it became they were not going to tell me. They obviously knew the truth but simply refused to answer; and that terrified me far more than anything else. These creepy dolls had both the knowledge of the answer, and the strong will to refuse.

I’d grown way beyond fatigued by the polite subterfuge and masterful game of redirect with ‘See’, ‘Speak’, and ‘Hear No Evil’; as I’d mentally dubbed them. I allowed my normal tendency of being polite to prevent me from just turning them off. They were so lifelike in generalized ways, it seemed ‘rude’. For the first time since the one-sided conversation began, I grinned briefly at the preposterous idea of caring about the potentially hurt feelings of discarded toys I’d stumbled across in the forest. It was absurd! They were inanimate machines for Heaven’s sake. 

My lingering worries were laughable, and yet something I couldn’t articulate prevented me from just ending the artificial experience. I was so caught up in the perceived realism of the situation that I couldn’t shake my undeserved respect for them. Reminding myself of the truth failed to take any traction. Their unthreatening faces distracted me until I suspected I was losing my mind.

Finally I’d had enough of the hypnotic fantasy and metaphorically shook myself awake. When I stood up in determination to switch them off, the situation escalated considerably.

“What are you doing?”; The ‘male’ doll spoke with alarm. The pitch in its animatronic tone rose mid-way through the sentence. Before I could stop myself from easing the concern of a talking machine, I responded from pure reflex. I was still wrapped up in the illusion I was conversing with actual people.

“I’m sorry but it’s time for the three of you to be silent!”; I insisted sternly, as if addressing petulant children. “If you aren’t going to tell me who put you in the woods, I’m going to switch you off and enjoy the rest of my afternoon, warming myself by the fire. I’m tired of playing ‘Who’s on first’. It lost its appeal a long time ago.”

All of a sudden, they went from adult-sized inanimate ‘muppets’ with an impressive AI interface and non-threatening faces, to something considerably less doll-like. Their stuffed faces actually seemed to reflect genuine worry and concern. Even more troublesome, the male who’d quizzed me, expressed obvious anger and moral indignation. I could see it in his evolving features. Their lifeless forms actually tensed up at the realization I would shut them down like unwanted vacuum cleaners. 

The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. It wasn’t my imagination playing tricks on me. Whatever they were, was significantly more than discarded children’s toys or novelty home assistants. It is impressive when AI devices can play songs or look up web trivia but this was another level. They were ultra-sophisticated in ways that didn’t seem possible. The strong likelihood occurred to me they might not even be of human origin.

“Wait! Please don’t do that. We don’t want to be powered off. Let’s keep talking. Perhaps there’s something else you might want to ask. We will answer you, if we are allowed to.”

I can’t begin to tell you how terrifying it was to realize the lifelike machines I foolishly dragged into my house, obey something other than humans in the same room with them. The chilling implication was, their ‘superior’ was without a pulse, or extraterrestrial. 

“Cut the damn bullshit!”; I shouted in growing fear. The three unblinking things propped up across from me reacted defensively. The ferocity of my voice betrayed how rattled I was. Their stuffed bodies seemed to grow tense. It was as if organic muscles or mechanical hydraulics developing within them would soon allow them to stand up or fight back. I detected no solid infrastructure inside them when I carried them home but then again, they were limp and ‘switched off’. Their internal physiology and sentience level was unknown but they had answers and I wanted them. For all I knew, they could gang up on me and resist my interrogation, or worse. Far, worse. I realized it was prudent to play along with the unfolding charade and leave them ‘awake’. 

That was my third mistake. 

“No person left us in the woods”; The ‘female’ offered matter-of-factly. “We came to this national forest on an important mission. Unfortunately we aren’t allowed to divulge the details to you, at this time.”

I was dumbstruck. There was too much information in that maddening statement to process. What were they? Where did they come from? Why were they on a ‘mission’ behind my house, of all places? The third of them seated in the recliner was more androgynous in generalized features. It had remained mostly quiet and allowed the other two units to carry the disturbing narrative, up until that point. 

Now, ‘number three’ took up the macabre conversation and I forced myself to focus my attention toward its stoic, expressionless gaze. I wasn’t sure if I could handle much more. My emotions ran the full gamut from amused, deeply curious, and also simultaneously horrified. 

“You aren’t ready to hear the truth from us. We are required to pacify you and obfuscate the facts until the time arrives when you are better prepared to accept what we were sent here to do.” 

Defiantly, I pointed out that they were switched off when I discovered them. That was hardly the condition you’d expect in-control mechanisms to be in; if they’d arrived here on a mission, purely by themselves. My point was that something other than them had switched off their power buttons. Admittedly, I was damn proud of my deductive reasoning and waited for an explanation, or more likely, an excuse. They’d already admitted to deceiving me earlier via obfuscation of facts. When no retort immediately came, I assumed I’d caught the ‘cute cloth doll cabal’ in a broadening lie. 

Outside, night had fallen. As creepy as it was to think I was entertaining sophisticated dolls in the daytime, it was infinitely worse. I realized I had three advanced beings of unknown origin and motive, lingering in the darkened room just a few feet from me! Only the flickering flames of my fireplace illuminated their inhuman forms studying me for weakness. It was the same enveloping darkness of the uninhabited forest behind my house which swallowed the ambient neighborhood light, and teased my subconscious fear of the unknown.

Were they sent on a mission to kill me? To kidnap me for biological study and dissection? Had I aided in my own demise by delivering complex artificial organisms of possible alien origin over my threshold, like Trojan horses? My heart raced at the broad possibilities. Then I swear to you, the faintest hint of a smile appeared simultaneously on their sullen, manufactured faces and cold, button eyes. They became more ‘alive’ by the moment.

It’s like they sensed and consumed the negative energy my developing fear generated. I realized I was giving off damaging biofeedback which they would use against me. I found myself trying to put on my best ‘poker face’ against a trio of deceitful serpents with ‘happy’ faces. 

“We turned ourselves off.” The male offered smugly. “It was decided by us to conserve energy until the day you finally discovered and delivered our hibernating vessels inside. It was all according to plan.”

The other two turned slightly with mechanical precision toward the speaker, as if to confirm his delayed explanation. With synchronized nods they attempted to add credibility but I wasn’t buying it. Still, seeing physical animation beginning to occur was unbelievably jarring. Initially, only the voices were simulated by a speech center within the body. Then came the noticeable tensing of their physiques when reacting in a more organic way. Now they were able to actually move their heads and form facial expressions. 

What would come next? It was obvious. Their physical capabilities and degree of human mannerisms were developing exponentially as the afternoon passed. They were learning to imitate mankind and I was their unwitting teacher! Raging paranoia aside, I could see the writing on the wall. Those abilities to better mimic our species would continue to evolve and be used against me in some counterproductive, or even hostile way very soon. Possibly to the point where I couldn’t defend myself. 

Maybe being deactivated for a long time caused a delay in their greater motor functions. Earlier, they asked me to not shut them down, but at the time they were little more than sedentary, ‘arguing toys’, as far as I knew. Now they were on course for the next frightening stage of personal interaction and full blown panic set in. I didn’t believe their hollow reassurances, but I had to maintain a calm facade and exterior demeanor; even if I was a crumbling wreck on the inside. They were getting visibly stronger and more agile. I needed to act soon. 

“Is your mission to aid or help me in some beneficial way?”

It was a clearly spoken query. It should’ve elicited an immediate response. The truthfulness of their answer wasn’t the point. I was curious if there would be a delay in confirmation that they meant me no harm or personal malice. If they couldn’t even pretend theirs was a benign mission, it was a obvious indicator of their true intentions. Their mutual, pregnant pause gave me the answer. 

The suspicious conspirators looked at each other, as if to confirm a unified response, over a transparent one. I followed up “It was a simple question”. I never thought I’d see a machine stammer but I’ll be damned if they didn’t act just like a used car salesperson. Regardless of origin, I guess the architect of their artificial intelligence imitated the tendency to stall and lie too well.

I noticed a twitch in the leg of the female. Just like butterflies fanning their wings to gain energy, they were getting stronger by the minute. I felt I could still overpower and shut them down but the details of their covert plans for me would go unrevealed if I did it too soon. I was pressing my luck but I hoped to squeeze a little more intel out of them before putting an end to the fiendish plot. I wanted to avoid a second wave of ‘creepy alien murder dolls’.

Sidestepping my ‘gotcha’ question, the male android attempted to lower my suspicions. “We only want what is best for you. All will be revealed very soon.”

“I see. You three are a unified team, right? You are directly connected as one unit?”

They looked at the androgynous one. It was clear to me that one held the central processor. The other two must be satellites. Cut off the head, and the serpent dies. I had my target. All three were becoming more animated. Just like a high stakes card game, the female twitched her foot constantly as a nervous ‘tell’. She was antsy to get out of the chair and finish their mission. The other two appeared just as eager but ‘she’ was slightly ahead in development. The constant foot twitch spoke to her heightened state of agitation. 

“We are one in thought and purpose, yes. Why do you ask?”

“Oh, no reason.”; I dismissed. “I was curious. Never mind about that. It was just small talk. I need to add more wood to the fire now.”

My three unwanted visitors showed visible signs of being nervous by the vague, rhetorical question. They realized as they probed me for information, I was doing the exact same thing. The ‘cat and mouse’ game is very complicated. It wasn’t completely clear who was the cat, and who was the mouse. 

I’d already witnessed the three of them subtly move all of their major body parts at one time or another. That signified they possessed the ability to stand on their own. As much as I wanted to know exactly what they were up to, the time to investigate was over. 

I pulled back the fireplace screen to toss in more logs. I could sense them watched me intently. It was terrifying to turn my back but I had to maintain the cover for my plan. In between the crackling of exploding embers, I heard the tell-tale squeak of my recliner springs. Their android leader stood and took several aggressive steps in my direction. I witnessed its unfolding intent to push me into the blaze, from the shiny reflection of the glass panes. It stood only two steps behind me and was closing fast, with arms raised to shove me inside. In full readiness, I pretended to be totally engrossed with my fireplace duties. 

With a ferocious dexterity I could scarcely repeat again if my life depended upon it, I whirled around, flipped off the switch, and tossed the accursed thing into the raging fire like cord wood. Its defeated squeal faded as soon as the power drained from its roasting mechanism. Then the flames burned it to blackened, carbon cinders. I witnessed the alien’s internal anatomy during the cremation, once the artificial shell had disintegrated. 

At last, I had a conclusive answer. 

It happened so fast the remaining two didn’t even know what hit them. They were stunned into a stammering fit when the main processor of their unit shut down and fully incinerated. Then I snatched up the male android and switched him off before he could recover or fight back. As soon as his stuffed torso flew into the pyre, the remaining unit kicked into high gear. She sprang off the couch with grace and coordinated poise the other two couldn’t have fathomed. She was the ninja of the trio.

There was no other way to describe her but fully pissed off and incredibly enraged. All pretense was dropped and the proverbial knives were out. She lunged at me with the strength of self preservation fueling her actions and guarded her vulnerable left side masterfully. There was no way I could easily flip the switch and put an end to the crazy game I was entangled in. The advantage of surprise had served me well until then, but it was lost now. She knew what I intended to do. I had to find another way.

The fireplace poker was handy so I used it to foil her forceful attacks like a blunt sword. By the primal sounds of the android’s ferocious efforts to kill, you would’ve thought a human being was inside that stuffed, doll-like shell. I whaled on my opponent like a swashbuckling fighter until I was panting and out of breath. Physically, I’m ashamed to admit we were pretty evenly matched. Unfortunately I was growing fatigued and losing my stamina. I switched gears to incorporate more cerebral tactics into the battle. 

“Dear heavens!”; I gasped in mock desperation and exaggerated fear. “You have a black widow spider on your shirt!”

Just as my ‘who’s on first’ Abbot and Costello reference surely escaped the three of them earlier, my ridiculous spider ruse was definitely a long shot. I didn’t expect it to work but human humor was the one area they hadn’t quite mastered. When she paused for a split second to glance downward at the location I was transfixed upon, I used the golden opportunity to smack the off switch with the fireplace poker. In the microsecond before the power faded, the spark of realization and resentment washed over her dying cognizance. It was beautiful. The last thing I witnessed before adding her ashes to the pile of soot were the incomplete beginnings of a smirk. 

“My best interest”, indeed I spat.

I still don’t know why aliens would send three AI units to kill me. Nor do I understand the logic of leaving them deactivated behind my house but I can’t argue that I fell for the damn Trojan ruse. Let my rookie mistake be one you avoid. If you encounter cute looking life-size dolls somewhere near your home, resist the urge to switch them on or bring them inside. It’s a trap. Just pitch them immediately into a nearby fire or trash compactor and avoid the headache of matching wits with the most sophisticated artificial intelligence beings you’ll ever encounter.
