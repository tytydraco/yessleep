You guys believe me, right? 

They tell me I’m crazy. The court-appointed shrink uses phrases like “dissociative break” and “psychotic episode.” They say I’m a danger to myself, to others. A murderer. but I'm not! 

I've left his name out of this out of respect from him and his family. They hate me right now but once the truth gets out, they will see. 

Unless it doesn't.

I’ll probably be locked in this room for the rest of my life, just staring at these four grey walls, trying to piece together what happened that night. My best friend is dead. And I'm the one taking the fall. But I didn't kill him. I know who did. It was a giant cuddly bear. No, I'm not insane. I was there. I saw everything. But now… now the police are telling me something that makes this whole nightmare so much more terrifying.

They’re telling me that I was the only other person in that room with him. They're wrong.

It was supposed to be a fun night. The last weekend before Halloween, a crisp, cold October evening where the air smelled like woodsmoke and dying leaves. We had been planning this for weeks—ever since we saw the first flyers for the “Asylum of Lost Toys.” It was a new haunted house that had taken over the abandoned warehouse down by the old cannery. The poster was genius-level creepy: a cracked porcelain doll with one button eye, sitting in a pool of what looked a little too much like real blood. We were horror junkies. Since we were sixteen, we’d hit every haunted house in a fifty-mile radius. We really thought we’d seen it all.

The line to get in stretched three blocks. The warehouse itself was this hulking, rust-coloured beast of corrugated steel. A thick, theatrical fog was being pumped out of its dark mouth, along with the distorted, broken music of an old ice cream truck.

Every few minutes, a bloodcurdling scream would erupt from inside, always followed by the nervous, excited laughter of the crowd. We were buzzing. My friend kept bouncing on the balls of his feet, his breath fogging up in the cold air. “Dude, this is gonna be epic,” he said, grinning. “I heard they use Hollywood-level effects. Real actors, no cheap jump scares.” I remember thinking how normal it all felt. Exciting. It was one of those perfect fall nights that already feels like a memory while you’re living it. We were twenty-four, and for a few hours, we could be kids again, getting scared for fun, knowing that when the night was over, the monsters would be packed away, and we’d go home safe.

That’s the deal, right? You pay for a scare you can control. You scream, you laugh, you leave. But the things inside the Asylum of Lost Toys… they didn't play by the rules. After what felt like forever, we were finally at the front. A guy with a ghoulish, painted face and a top hat waved us toward a small, dark doorway. “The toys are waiting for you,” he rasped, his voice like grinding gravel. “Try not to break them. They tend to break back.” We laughed. Good line.

We stepped through the doorway, and the heavy door slammed shut behind us, plunging us into almost total darkness. The noise from outside was gone, replaced by a low, humming drone and the faint, unsettling sound of a child’s lullaby playing in reverse.

The first part of the house was obviously meant to give you a false sense of security. It was a twisted version of a kid's bedroom. The wallpaper, covered in cheerful cartoon rainbows, was peeling to show these dark, mouldy-looking stains underneath. The air was thick with the sick, sweet, artificial smell of bubble gum. In the middle of the room, under a single flickering bulb, was an animatronic of that kids TV Pig thing. Or some version of her.

Her pink plastic skin was grimy and faded, and one of her soulless black eyes was half-closed like she was having a stroke. She was rocking a baby carriage back and forth in this jerky, unnatural motion while a high-pitched squeal came from a hidden speaker. My friend snorted. “Okay, that’s just creepy,” he whispered, but he was smiling.

We walked past it, heading deeper into the maze. The next room was a demented nursery rhyme. The walls were painted with scenes from “Hey Diddle Diddle,” only the cow was a skeleton, and the fiddle was dripping with blood. It was standard haunted house stuff. Effective, sure, but not terrifying. We were pros, after all.

And then we walked into the “Dark dark forest” room. Or what was left of it. You couldn't mistake the theme. The walls were painted to look like a dark, overgrown forest. The cheerful signs for Rabbit’s House and Owl’s House were splintered and rotting. The air got cold, a deep, damp chill that had nothing to do with the autumn night outside. And there he was, sitting on a log in the middle of the room. The cuddle bear. He looked just like he did in the old storybooks. Short, stout, that simple, friendly face, and a little shirt two sizes too small. He was holding a big ceramic honey pot.

But something was just profoundly wrong. The light in the room was low, casting these long, dancing shadows, but his eyes… his two little black button eyes just seemed to swallow the light. They were voids. There was no friendly glint, no hint of stuffing. Just a deep, unnerving emptiness. He wasn’t moving. Just sitting there, hunny pot on his lap, watching us.

We stopped. The playful mood from the last few rooms just vanished. That humming drone seemed to get louder, and I could feel a low vibration through the soles of my shoes. “Man,” he said quietly, his earlier confidence gone. “They really nailed the uncanny valley on this one.” He took a step forward to get a better look.

And that’s when it happened.

What the detectives later called “the inciting incident.” It’s head, which was facing straight ahead, slowly, and deliberately turned. His neck didn’t move. Just the head, rotating on his stuffed shoulders with this faint, dry rustle of fabric. It turned until its blank, black eyes were locked right on me.

A sound came from it, a low, garbled electronic voice that was supposed to be the cartoon but came out warped and distorted. “Oh, bother,” it rasped, the sound crackling like a dying radio. He jumped back with a nervous laugh. “Whoa! Okay, that got me.” But I couldn't laugh.

My blood felt like ice. It wasn't just the movement, or the voice. It was the way it looked at me. It wasn't some pre-programmed motion. It felt like… recognition. It felt like it saw me. I grabbed His arm and practically dragged him away. “Come on, let’s go,” I muttered, my heart hammering.

My friend was still trying to act cool. “Dude, relax, it’s just an animatronic. A really good one, but still.” But then, a few hallways later, in a section that was supposed to be a slaughterhouse with hanging pig carcasses, we saw him again. He was at the far end of the hall, partly hidden by fog. That stupid shirt was unmistakable. He was just… standing there. Not moving.

Watching. “How did he get there?” I whispered, my voice shaking. The whole place was a one-way maze. We hadn’t passed any side paths. “Maybe there’s more than one?” he suggested, but he didn't sound so sure. The corridor walls seemed to close in on us. The sound in this section was a nightmare of dripping water and a distant buzzsaw, but under it all, I could still hear that low, humming drone.

We turned down another hall, a long, dark passage lined with cracked mirrors. Strobe lights flashed, shattering our reflections into a thousand jagged pieces. In every flash, I swore I saw a bit of red, a round yellow shape just behind us. I started walking faster, then jogging. My friend was right behind me. The fun was gone. This wasn’t fun. We were being stalked.

We burst through a set of double doors into what looked like a dead end. It was a child’s playroom, but every toy was broken. Mutilated. Dolls with their heads ripped off, teddy bears torn open with their stuffing pulled out. In the middle of it all was a small table set for a tea party. The strobe was gone, replaced by the eerie glow of a single bare bulb swinging from the ceiling, making the shadows writhe on the walls.

We were trapped.

The doors we’d come through were locked behind us. “Okay, this isn’t funny,” He started banging on the door. “Hey! Let us out! The door’s stuck!” But His voice just echoed. No response. The only sounds were the creak of the lightbulb and my own ragged breathing.

And then I heard it.

From the far corner of the room, deep in the shadows. A familiar, warped, glitching, electronic voice. “I fff-found yy-you."

Slowly, a figure stepped out of the darkness. It was him. The bear again. But he looked different now. The simple face was stretched into a grotesque, predatory grin. His fabric body looked stained, and a dark, wet patch was spreading across his shirt.

He wasn't holding the hunny pot anymore. His plush, yellow hands were empty, curled into tight fists. He took a step. It wasn't the jerky movement of an animatronic. It was fluid. Deliberate. He took another step, then another, his soft feet making no sound on the dusty floor.

My friend had stopped banging on the door. We were both just frozen, pinned against the wall by those two bottomless black eyes. The illusion was gone. This wasn't a machine. This wasn't a guy in a suit. This was something else. Something impossible.

“What do you want?” My friend stammered, holding a hand out. The creature tilted its head, that same dry, rustling sound echoing in the silence. It didn't answer. It just kept coming, its pace picking up.

We were backed against the wall. Nowhere to run. I remember scrambling for a weapon, my hand finding a sharp, jagged piece of a broken porcelain doll. But I never used it. The creature lunged. It moved with a speed that shouldn't have been possible for its bulky shape. It ignored me and went straight for him. It wrapped its soft arms around him in a sick parody of a hug, and he screamed. It was a sound of pure agony and terror that will haunt me until I die.

I saw the hunny pot then. It had been behind its back. It was broken. He had a jagged piece of the ceramic clutched in his right paw. With horrifying strength, the creature drove the sharp edge of the broken pot into his side. Once. Twice. Three times. The sound was wet and sickening. his body went limp, and the creature just dropped him. It stood over him for a second, head cocked, before turning its empty gaze to me. It just stared; its face splattered with my best friend’s blood. And then, from its distorted voice box, it whispered one last thing. “Oh, bother.” 

The world went silent.

The monster in the bear costume just turned and walked back into the shadows it came from. It didn't vanish in a puff of smoke. It just walked away. For a moment, I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe. My mind was just a screaming void of white noise. Then, a loud buzzer sounded, and the door we’d been banging on swung open. The normal, cheesy haunted house sounds flooded back in, the distant screams, the buzzsaw, the distorted music. I fell to my knees beside him.

There was so much blood. It was pooling on the floor, soaking into the grimy carpet, dark and thick under that swinging bulb. I put my hands on his chest, trying to stop it, but it was useless. His eyes were open, just staring at the ceiling with a look of shocked surprise. I was screaming his name, over and over.

Employees came running in. Their faces, painted to look like ghouls, twisted into masks of real shock and horror when they saw us. I tried to tell them. I was hysterical, babbling, my words a mess.

“It was the bear! The animatronic! It killed him! It just walked away!” They just looked at me like I was insane. They saw me, on my knees, covered in blood, holding a piece of a broken doll, next to my friend’s body. They saw the jagged, blood-soaked piece of ceramic, what was left of the hunny pot, on the floor.

They didn't see a monster. They just saw me. The police came. The paramedics. They pronounced him dead at the scene. They put me in handcuffs. I kept trying to explain what happened, sobbing and gasping for air. I told them about the animatronic, how it followed us, trapped us, how it attacked my best friend. I described it in perfect detail: the empty black eyes, the warped voice, the impossible way it moved.

They took my statement, but I could see it in their eyes. Pity. Disbelief. They searched the entire haunted house. Every room, every hallway, every secret passage for the actors. They catalogued every single prop and animatronic. Now I’m sitting in this sterile interrogation room. I’ve told this story a dozen times. To the cops, the lawyers, the shrinks. They all give me the same look.

Yesterday, the lead detective, a tired-looking guy , came in. He sat down across the metal table, slid a folder toward me, and sighed. “We’ve been over this, son,” he said, his voice flat. “We have the full inventory list from the owners. We have security footage from the entire setup. We have statements from every employee.” He leaned forward, locking his eyes on mine. And then he delivered the final, soul-crushing blow.

The sentence that shattered what was left of my mind. “There were no animatronics in that house. Not a single one. And especially not a giant teddy bear.”

My world just stopped. No animatronics. But I saw it. We both saw it. It killed him. I felt the cold in that room. I heard its voice. My memories are so sharp, so clear. But they’re telling me none of it was real. They’re telling me I’m the one who picked up that broken piece of ceramic. That I’m the one who snapped. That I killed my own best friend. And the most terrifying part is, without that thing, I have no other explanation. So, I sit here, in the silence, waiting for a trial I know I can’t win. And the only question that circles endlessly in my shattered mind is the one they can’t answer.

Do you want to know the one that keeps me awake at night, more than the memory of my best friend dying in my arms?

Last night, I heard something. It came from the hall outside my cell. It was soft. so soft i almost missed it. 

A glitchy robotic whisper. 

"Ddd-do you ww-want to play again?"

If it wasn't an animatronic…, what was it? because, It's still [out there](https://youtu.be/m3zrw0CAteU).
