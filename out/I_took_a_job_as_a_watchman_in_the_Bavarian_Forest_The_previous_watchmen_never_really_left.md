 The Bavarian Forest in southwestern Germany spans about six thousand square kilometres across Baden-Württemberg. Follow it far enough and it merges with the Šumava along the Czech border, eventually leading to the Großer Rachel peak region. This area, known as the Rachelgebiet, is considered the heart of the Bavarian Forest, a place where human activity is strictly prohibited—though not for the reasons most believe.

Much of the Rachelgebiet was once part of the “iron curtain,” a division that kept people and nations carefully separated from the end of World War II through the Cold War. The threat of encountering hostile forces kept the majority of people out, allowing nature to reclaim the land untouched. Or so they say. Entire swathes of fallen trees lay where storms dropped them decades ago, rotting quietly in the perpetual twilight beneath the canopy. No trails, no clearings, no signs of civilization. Just an endless forest so dense you could walk for days without seeing direct sunlight. I'm telling you this now to highlight how isolated and ancient this little part of our world is. And perhaps to explain why no one noticed when people started disappearing.

You can imagine my surprise when I got the job.                                       

I'd just been fired from a warehouse logistics role. My interim boss at the time was a twenty-four year old nepo plant, running the place whilst his father was on vacation. The heir apparent was short-tempered and arrogant. One of those types who think they know everything about running a business because they've read “*Rich Dad Poor Dad*” and follow Gary Vee on Instagram.

So when I warned him that scheduling the bulk wine deliveries during vintage season would overwhelm our already maxed-out cold storage—three hundred containers of temperature-sensitive stock with nowhere to go but the forty-degree loading bay—I did so with the kind of numb acceptance that comes from watching a train wreck in slow motion. The numbers were clear as day: our facility could handle maybe sixty containers max, and that's if we Tetris'd them in there like our lives depended on it. The rest would sit out in the Queensland sun, slowly cooking into very expensive vinegar. But my words just floated through that empty chasm between his ears and disappeared into the nether, probably to join all the other ignored warnings from people who actually knew what they were talking about.

So come five, the workers walked, leaving behind a ghost town of half-stacked pallets and beeping forklifts low on charge. The first trucks were already lined up outside, drivers getting antsy in their cabs, paperwork clutched in sweaty hands. By morning, it’d be a shit show. I remember standing in that empty warehouse, looking up at the mountains of boxes we'd somehow have to deal with, and knew if I came in tomorrow my ass would be handed to me by some private educated ponce with a business degree I'd bet good money he paid someone else to earn.

So I left my vest and company-issued hardhat in my office, dropped my pass and forklift keys into the after hours post slot, and walked out. Drove home in my beat-up Commodore, windows down because the AC had died two summers ago and I'd never bothered fixing it. Blocked every number in my phone still related to that place, cracked open a beer, and started looking for a new job.

That's when I found the listing for the watchtower position.

The job listing was sparse on details but heavy on requirements. Posted by the Brides of Christendom—a religious organization I'd heard whispers about, mostly the kind you'd expect from people who think anything more organized than a Sunday service must be hiding something. They had deep pockets, that much was clear from the salary they were offering. Six figures for what amounted to glorified data collection in the middle of nowhere? I'd have been suspicious if I wasn't so desperate. If I'd been thinking clearly, I might have wondered why they needed someone so far from their usual territory.

I remembered that mess with Kirby Leedy a few years back. Everyone did. She'd gone out to their compound in Warlpiri country to do an exposé on what she called “Australia's most dangerous cult.” Years later, they found what was left of her buried under the red dirt. The investigation went nowhere—no evidence, they said. Just circumstantial links that weren't enough for charges. The compound shut down soon after, leaving nothing but empty buildings and unanswered questions baking in the outback sun.

But here's the thing: I knew a guy called Mason, who'd done their grocery deliveries out there for years. Real straight-shooter type, not the kind to sugar-coat anything. He swore up and down that the women there were nothing but kind. “Just trying to live their faith,” he'd said over beers one night. “Media got it all wrong, mate. Those ladies wouldn't hurt a fly.”

Besides, this position wasn't even in Australia. It was halfway across the world in a forest I'd never heard of until now.

The requirements were specific. They wanted someone strong, with mountaineering experience. Fair enough, given the location. But then they went on about “extraordinary attention to detail” and the ability to take scientific readings. The listing emphasized—almost defensively—that no science background was necessary, however. They were more interested in someone with “passion for nature” and “dedication to environmental preservation.”

*“We believe that true understanding of nature comes from devotion rather than education,” the posting read. “The right candidate will share our commitment to protecting God's creation through careful observation and documentation.”*

It was a twelve-month contract, no renewals possible. That struck me as odd—usually these kinds of positions want someone they can train up and keep. But they were clear: one year, no exceptions. The job involved manning one of their watchtowers solo, taking regular readings that they didn’t specify. They'd provide training, they said. Every second weekend, I'd meet with a Brides of Christendom representative to hand over my data, which would supposedly help with their environmental conservation efforts.

*“Your work will contribute to our understanding of natural cycles and help preserve the delicate balance of God's creation,” the listing continued.*

It was vague enough to sound meaningful while saying absolutely nothing concrete. Like a horoscope, or a prophecy—words you could pour any meaning into, depending on what you wanted to hear.

The isolation part didn't bother me. After dealing with that walking management disaster at the warehouse, a year of minimal human contact sounded like heaven. They'd provide food, accommodation, and all necessary equipment. The pay was enough to set me up nicely afterward, maybe start that ginger beer line I’d had brewing for a while. I was a pretty experienced hiker, was familiar with most of the major peaks in the world—even taught an abseiling class in Croatia for a while in my mid-twenties.

I took another swig of beer and started filling out the application. Sometimes the devil you don't know is better than the one you do—even if that devil happens to be a religious organization with a questionable past and very specific requirements for watching trees in Germany.

Radio silence followed my application. Two weeks of refreshing my email and jumping every time my phone buzzed. I picked up temp work loading trucks—the irony wasn't lost on me—and tried not to think about how quickly my savings were dwindling. In hindsight, they were probably waiting, watching, assessing my desperation level. Making sure I was in exactly the right state of mind when they made their offer.

“Your application was very strong,” she said cheerfully, after introducing herself as Sister Katherine. “Tell me a little more about your background.”

I mentioned my warehouse work, inventory management, quality control. Heavily stressed a life-long interest in nature, even found a way to mention that one time I backed up an entire highway to save a yellow-tailed cockatoo from pancake city. Eventually she prodded:

“And your scientific background?”

“None, really. Basic high school stuff. Bit of chemistry in first year uni before I dropped out.”

There was a pause, then a sound I could've sworn was satisfaction. “Good. Very good. We find those with too much formal education often struggle with our methods. Our approach is more *holistic*, but we’re confident in the results we’ve seen so far.”

The questions continued. Had I ever lived alone for extended periods? Was I comfortable with isolation? Could I follow precise instructions without deviation? Then, almost casually: “Are you a man of faith, Mr. Davies?”

“No,” I admitted. “Never really took to it.”

She laughed, a warm sound that seemed genuinely amused. “That's quite common among our watchmen. Though they all leave believing, one way or another.”

The call ended abruptly with a promise to be in touch. A week later, an email arrived from their HR department—I had the job. A woman (another Katherine, oddly) handled the logistics: plane tickets, necessary paperwork, a list of what to bring. I spent the next month wrapping up my life. Found someone to take over my lease, stored my furniture at my parents' place, sold what I couldn't store.

The flight to Munich felt surreal. From there, I caught a train to Zwiesel, a small town that serves as one of the main gateways to the Bavarian Forest. A woman in a white robe was waiting at the station, holding a sign with my name. Sister Mary, she introduced herself, all smiles and enthusiastic German-accented English.

We drove for hours in a sensible Volkswagen, deeper and deeper into the forest. The roads got narrower, the trees taller, until the canopy above formed an unbroken ceiling that turned afternoon into perpetual twilight. Sister Elsa chatted the whole way about the forest's history, the Bride of Christendom’s conservation work, how blessed they were to have another watchman.

The tower appeared suddenly—a stark silhouette against the darkening sky. Modern construction despite its isolated location, rising maybe forty meters above the trees. My home for the next year.

“Now,” Sister Elsa said, unfolding a map on the tower's small table. “You have twelve locations to monitor.” She traced a perfect circle around the tower, marking each point. “Each requires different readings.”

The next two hours were a crash course in data collection. Soil samples at points one through four, using a special probe that measured something she called “resonance.” Air quality readings at points five through eight, with a device that looked more like an antique compass than any scientific instrument I'd seen. The last four points needed water samples from streams, tested with strips that changed colors in patterns I was told to document but not interpret.

“Every Sunday,” she explained, “you will take the trail to Spiegelau. Five hours each way. You'll meet one of our sisters at the Waldkirche at noon to deliver your readings and receive supplies.”

The training felt rushed, inadequate for the precision they seemed to want. But before I could ask for clarification, Sister Elsa was heading for her car. “The Lord's work awaits,” she said cheerfully. “You'll do fine.”

Then she was gone, leaving me alone in a tower that suddenly felt very tall and very isolated. The single room at the top was sparse but functional—bed, kitchenette, bathroom behind a partition. The windows wrapped all the way around, giving me a 360-degree view of absolutely nothing but darkening forest. Perfect visibility in every direction. Like a fishbowl.

I unpacked my bags, trying to make the space feel more like home. Everything felt fresh, almost surgically so—this place had plenty of fresh air, but I could smell the lingering after-burn of rubbing alcohol, as if this place had received a deep clean before I moved in. Thoughtful. Once I made my bed, I tried to settle in for the night. But as the last enduring rays of the sun disappeared and the forest plunged into absolute darkness, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching from those trees. Looking up at my brightly lit box in the sky. At the time, I laughed it off. I’d spent a good chunk of my life camping and scaring myself shitless. The human imagination is inexorably linked with our primate brain. The mind feeds you images of moving shadows and ghouls under beds and murderers in darkened alleyways. It’s a way of keeping you on your toes, keeping you alive.

So I summed up those feelings of unease that night to little more than my imagination.

As always, I should have listened to my gut.

The first month passed easily enough. I developed a routine: wake at dawn, make coffee, check the weather. The readings took most of the morning—a perfect circle through the forest, each point marked by a small metal stake driven into the ground. I'd document everything in a leather-bound logbook they'd provided, filling page after page with numbers I didn't understand.

The soil probe would hum at different frequencies, displaying readings in units I'd never heard of. Sometimes I'd catch myself staring at it for minutes at a time, watching the needle bounce meaninglessly back and forth, until the damp from the ground would seep through my pants and snap me back to awareness. The air quality device looked like something from a steampunk novel, with brass dials that moved in patterns that seemed to follow no logical system I could discern. The water test strips would bloom in complex color patterns—not just changing to a single shade, but developing intricate designs like tiny abstract paintings. Beautiful, really. I'd find myself mesmerized by them, watching the colors swirl and merge until the morning light had somehow slipped into afternoon.

Sundays became my favorite day. I'd leave before sunrise for the long trek to Spiegelau, watching the forest wake up around me. Sometimes I'd pass clearings that seemed too perfectly circular, or stumble upon old equipment I assumed belonged to previous watchmen—a rusted thermos here, a torn backpack there, once even what looked like a full set of clothes laid out as if their owner had simply evaporated. The town itself was small but alive, a shock of civilization after six days of solitude. I'd submit my readings to whichever Sister was assigned that week, trying not to notice how intently they studied my face, my movements, before they even glanced at the logbook. Then I'd treat myself to a proper meal at the local Gasthaus—something that wasn't from a can or the tower's cramped freezer. I was four weeks in, and never wanted to touch spam again in my life. The owner of the restaurant we would meet in never seemed to remember me from week to week, though I was surely one of his few regular customers. Maybe all us watchmen just looked the same to him after a while.

I tried googling the devices I used for the readings during these brief windows of connectivity, but found nothing even remotely similar. Searches for other watchmen's experiences came up empty. When I casually asked one of the Sisters about previous watchmen, she smiled that serene smile they all seemed to share and said, “The watchtower is new, and so is your position. There weren’t any watchmen before you.”

They also sprung health checks on me. Took longer than submitting the readings.

The health checks were exhaustive. Blood pressure, reflexes, muscle tone, coordination tests. They'd shine lights in my eyes, test my hearing, measure my heart rate after basic exercises. One Sister would take detailed notes while another performed the tests, their pens scratching against paper with the same methodical precision as my measurement devices in the forest. Sometimes I'd catch them exchanging glances, making small marks in margins.

Then came the questions, always the same:

“How is your motivation level?”

“Are you maintaining your energy throughout the day?”

“Describe your sleep patterns.”

“Rate your overall sense of purpose from one to ten.”

They'd inspect everything I bought before I headed back—food, supplies, even magazines. “Certain materials can interfere with the readings,” they'd explain. “Modern chemicals, electronic devices, some dyes. We must protect the purity of our work.” Once, when I bought an extra coffee maker for the tower, Sister Agnes almost seemed alarmed. She confiscated it immediately, muttering something about “artificial stimulation corrupting natural patterns.”

I learned to line my socks with sachets of instant coffee. Some things I just wasn’t willing to give up.

It all seemed excessive but well-intentioned. Until things started to change.

It began with sleep. I'd always been an early riser, but suddenly I was sleeping through my alarms. I'd wake groggy, disoriented, sometimes well past noon. The Sisters noticed—of course they did. “Quite normal,” they assured me during the health checks, making those little marks in their notebooks. “The forest has its own rhythm. Best not to fight it.”

My appetite disappeared. Dishes piled up in the sink because the thought of washing them felt overwhelming. My daily hikes became shorter, then stopped altogether. I'd sit in the tower's single chair for hours, staring at the trees, thinking nothing. Sometimes I'd “wake up” to find I'd been sitting there so long the sun had set, though I couldn't remember what I'd been thinking about or even if I'd been thinking at all.

*Depression*, I thought. I’d experienced it, once. It was something like this.

The caffeine pills and energy drinks I smuggled back helped, but only barely. The Sisters never found them in their inspections—I'd gotten good at hiding things—but sometimes I wondered if they knew anyway. They'd give me these knowing looks during the health checks, especially when testing my reflexes or measuring my pulse. The younger ones would seem almost excited, while the older Sisters would nod with grim satisfaction, as if I were confirming something they'd suspected all along.

I told myself it was the altitude, or seasonal affect disorder, or simple isolation. But I'd done solo work before. I'd lived alone. This was different. It wasn't just tiredness—it was like something was slowly draining away my will to do anything at all. Even writing in my personal journal became an effort. The entries grew shorter, then stopped altogether. The last one before this just trails off mid-sentence, as if I'd forgotten what I was trying to say.

Or why I was trying to say it at all.

Then came the nights.

The first time I saw one, I was about to head out for a late evening reading. Just a figure at first, moving between the trees. It looked like a man, but something was wrong about the way it moved—sluggish, dreamlike, as if every step required immense effort. One foot dragging itself after the other, stumbling over roots and through thickets. It would stop for long periods, head limp and lolling against its shoulder, swaying slightly, as if it had forgotten what it was doing or where it was going.

I watched through the tower windows, telling myself it was just another hiker, though I knew no one else was supposed to be out here. But there was something familiar about the way it was dressed—heavy boots, weatherproof jacket, the kind of gear I wore for my readings. With the aid of a pair of binoculars, I could see dark stains on their clothing, patches where the fabric had started to rot.

They kept appearing. Always at the edge of my vision, always just as the sun set. Sometimes alone, sometimes in pairs. Just lingering among the tree line. Their movements seemed *wrong*. Like people moving through thick syrup, or a video played at quarter speed. Sometimes they'd just stop mid-step and stay there, swaying slightly, for hours. I know because I watched one once, unable to look away, until dawn started creeping over the trees. As the light touched him, he seemed to stir slightly before shuffling deeper into the forest.

I found their traces during my daily readings. Bootprints walking in aimless circles. Old equipment scattered about—rusted soil probes, torn backpacks, logbooks so water-damaged the pages had fused together. Once, I found a jacket identical to mine draped over a tree branch. The name tag was still legible: “Richard K. - Tower 4.” The fabric crumbled when I touched it.

The worst part was the silence. The forest should have been full of night sounds—owls, small animals, wind in the trees. But whenever they appeared, everything went quiet. Like the whole forest was holding its breath. Or like these wandering figures had somehow drawn all the life and energy from the air itself.

I stopped going out after dark.

Started double-checking my locks.

Tried to convince myself I was imagining things.

Then came the crackle from beneath the floorboards.

At first, I thought I was imagining it—another trick of an increasingly unreliable mind. But no, there it was again. A static burst, followed by what sounded like a voice. I found the loose board near my bed, and underneath it, wrapped in oilcloth: an old walkie-talkie and a pack of fresh batteries.

“Hello?” The voice was clear, accented, but eerily tired. “New guy? You there?”

I hesitated before responding. My fingers felt clumsy on the talk button, like they were forgetting how to work. “Who is this?”

“Jabari. I'm in Tower Seven, about fifteen kilometers northeast. Been here ten months now.” His voice had an urgency to it, but also a heaviness, like each word was an effort. “Had a relationship with your predecessor, but he just... disappeared one day.”

“Disappeared? What do you mean?”

‘You’re tower 6. You won’t last long, either. They never do.”

None of his words made sense to me at the time, but they still put the fear of God into me.

‘He left all his stuff,’ Jabari continued, as though to himself. ‘Even his readings. Thought I think I saw him last week, wandering near my tower. He didn't... he couldn't...” He trailed off.

My heart was pounding, though the effort of holding the walkie-talkie was already making my arm tired. “We're not supposed to have contact with other watchmen.”

“No shit.” A dry laugh, followed by a long pause—so long I thought he'd fallen asleep. Finally: “But there are things in this forest they don't tell us about. Things you've probably started to notice. Share your readings with me. I've got a theory—”

“This could be a test,” I cut him off. “From the Sisters.”

Another laugh, but harder this time. “Fine. But when you start to see them—really see them—and you start to suspect what I suspect, I'm here until the end of September. I'll keep my walkie close.” His voice dropped lower. “If I'm still here.”

The transmission ended. I sat there in the darkness, staring at the device in my hands, trying to convince myself I'd imagined the whole thing. Outside, the forest had gone quiet again. And in the distance, barely visible in the moonlight, a figure in a weatherproof jacket stood perfectly still between the trees, head tilted at an odd angle, as if it had forgotten where it was going. Or what it once was.

It’s wild how fiercely your mind fights to rationalize things, even when every instinct in your gut is screaming that something’s wrong. I clung to denial, desperate to believe that ignoring the signs might somehow strip away the horror and leave behind a mundane, harmless explanation. So I turned off the walkie-talkie, yanked out the battery for good measure, and forced myself—through sheer, Herculean effort—to complete my tasks each day. All the while, my energy and will seemed to drain away, hour by hour, as if the very act of existing was bleeding me dry.

Looking back, I should have noticed sooner how wrong the forest was. Not dead—everything was technically alive—but existing in a kind of half-life. Birds would perch on branches for hours, barely moving. Foxes wouldn't chase rabbits but simply wait, conserving energy, until their prey grew too lethargic to hop away. Even the insects seemed sluggish, their wingbeats visible in the thick air. I once watched a wolf pack take down a deer. They didn't chase it. Just followed, walking, for days until it forgot how to run.

My own decline was becoming impossible to ignore. Yesterday, I noticed with growing horror how dark my urine had become and realized I couldn’t remember the last time I’d had water—two days? Three? The fear that came with that realization was enough to push me into forcing down two liters in one sitting. I felt the water soothe my raw, parched throat, but the expected satisfaction never came. No relief, no gratitude from my body—just a hollow, almost mournful acceptance, as though it knew this vital resource was far too little, far too late.

Last Sunday, after what should have been a leisurely, five-hour trek took me almost eight, I broke down and told Sister Agnes I was scared. She didn't seem surprised. Just asked me to hold on one more week while they “arranged a replacement.” Her calm felt rehearsed like she'd had this conversation before.

That was five days ago. I haven't taken a reading since. The devices sit in their case, humming their meaningless songs to no one. This morning, I tried to make it to Spiegelau. I couldn't wait for Sunday. Not after another night of those things circling the tower, their rotting faces turned up toward my windows. Not after I noticed my fingernails had started turning black at the beds, or how my gums bled when I bothered to brush my teeth. The human body can only go so long without proper nutrition before it starts eating itself.

I packed a day bag with what felt like lead weights. Every item—water bottle, compass, emergency kit—seemed to weigh ten times what it should. My hands shook so badly it took three tries to zip the bag closed. The mirror caught my reflection as I headed for the door: sunken eyes in a gray face, cheekbones sharp enough to cast shadows. I didn't recognize myself.

The forest was bright when I set out, morning sun streaming through the canopy. I'd made this trek dozens of times before. *Five hours to town. Five hours to help. Simple.*

The first kilometer was like walking through wet cement. Each step required conscious effort—lift foot, move forward, place down, repeat. My muscles felt like they were filled with sand. I kept checking behind me, certain I'd see them following, but there was only empty forest. The silence felt anticipatory, like the whole woods was holding its breath, watching.

By the second kilometer, I was stopping every few minutes to rest. My vision would blur, then clear, then blur again. The path seemed to stretch endlessly ahead, twisting in ways I didn't remember. Had it always been this steep? This winding? My heart pounded with effort that would have been nothing a month ago.

I started talking to myself, trying to maintain focus. “One foot. Then the other. Just like that. Keep moving.” My voice sounded wrong in the thick air, like it was coming from somewhere else. Someone else.

The weight came gradually. Not physical—something deeper. Like gravity itself was increasing, pulling me toward the earth. My shoulders curved under it. My spine wanted to bend. Every few steps, I had to remind myself why I was walking. Where I was going. Who I was.

I don't remember falling. Just the suddenly close view of dead leaves, the damp smell of soil. My cheek pressed against the earth, and I could have sworn I felt it pulling at me, trying to draw me down and deep*. I should get up,* I thought. *Should keep moving.*

*But why?* The thought came with strange clarity. *Why fight it?* The ground was soft. The air was warm. I was so, so tired.

My eyes closed.

When they opened again, it was night.

I've never been in these woods after dark. Never really understood why that was such a strict rule until now.

The panic gave me enough energy to stumble to my feet. The tower was closer than town—maybe forty minutes in my current state. I pulled out my flashlight and forced myself to move. The beam seemed weak, as if the darkness here was something physical, something that could push back against the light.

That's when I heard them.

Footsteps. All around me. Not coordinated enough to be walking, but not random enough to be stumbling. The sound of dragging feet through dead leaves, coming from every direction at once. The beam of my flashlight caught glimpses: figures in various states of decay, wearing the tattered remains of weatherproof gear. Their skin was gray where it wasn't black with rot, stretched tight over bones. Some still had name tags. Some still had faces.

I recognized one—Richard K. from Tower 4, whose jacket I'd found. His flesh had the waxy texture of a corpse, but his chest still rose and fell with shallow breaths. His eyes were clouded but aware, tracking my movement with terrible recognition. His mouth moved, forming words without sound. Then I realized—he was warning me. They all were. Their mouths moved in silent unison: *“Run.”*

I ran. Somehow. Each step felt like moving through a physical barrier, but terror is a hell of a motivator. Behind me, they followed. Not chasing—they couldn't move fast enough for that. Just inexorably following. Like they knew I'd tire eventually. Like they remembered doing this very thing when they were still fully human, still capable of fear.

One was closer than the others. The remains of a blonde beard clung to his chin in patches. His uniform was newer than the others—couldn't have been out here more than a few months. His eyes met mine as I passed, and there was still something there. Something that remembered being someone. He reached for me with blackened fingers, not grabbing, but beseeching. Wanting to tell me something. Wanting to warn me.

The sound that came from his throat wasn't words. Just a low, continuous moan that might have been despair.

I made it back to the tower. My hands were shaking so badly I dropped the walkie-talkie twice before getting the new batteries in. Behind me, through the windows, I could see them gathering. Some stood perfectly still, faces upturned to my light. Others swayed gently, like seaweed in a current. A few simply sat where they stopped, as if they'd forgotten how to stand.

“Jabari? Jabari, please...”

Static. Then: “...here.” His voice was barely a whisper. “Bad... night?”

“What the fuck is happening here?”

A long pause. Just breathing. Then: “Should tell you... truth. I lied. On application. Have PhD... biochemistry. Knew they didn't want... scientists. But needed job.”

“The readings—”

“Bullshit. All of it.” Each sentence seemed to cost him enormous effort. “Soil resonance... meaningless term. Air quality devices... just pretty toys. Water test patterns... random. Found old records... in floorboards. Letters. Notes from... previous watchmen.”

His breathing was getting worse. “Eight generations. Eight... towers. Always moving... getting closer together. Triangulating.”

“Triangulating what?”

“The source. Why we're all... like this.” A wet cough. “They're measuring *us*... not the forest. Instruments are red herrings. Our dying bodies are… the true reading. How fast we fade. How quickly we... join them. The quicker we…fade…the closer they are…to finding it.’

Through the static, I heard papers rustling. “Wrote it all down... proper analysis. Soil probe generates random frequencies... air quality meter just... runs on clockwork. No actual... sensors. But us? They measure everything. Weight loss... cognitive decline... energy depletion...”

The sound of something heavy falling. Jabari cursing weakly.

“Pattern in tower movements... over decades. They take them down…rebuild…with every missing watchman. Spiraling inward. Getting closer to... finding what they’re looking for. Watchmen in…tower two…last barely a week before they…*fade*.”

A sound from outside made me jump. I stood and peeked through the expansive window. The watchmen were walking away now, disappearing into the thicket of the forest. Like they’d given up. Or knew it was too late for me. I tried to believe it was the former.

“Have to... tell you.” Jabari's voice was fading. “Overheard Sisters... talking. One word. Belphegor. Do you know…who that is? ‘Cause it’s not good.”

The name hit me like ice water. Catholic school lessons from years ago. Sister Mary Catherine's stern voice: “*Belphegor, demon prince of Sloth, who draws men into the sin of spiritual apathy...*”

“Jabari, listen. We need to get out. Meet halfway. Help each other—”

“Too late for me.” His laugh turned into a wet cough. “Haven't eaten... two weeks. Legs don't work anymore. Been using dexies to stay... awake. Almost out. *Run*. While you can. Get help.”

“I can't leave you—”

“Already gone. Just... fighting the inevitable. Run.”

The static took over. I called his name three more times. Nothing.

I threw whatever I could reach into my bag. Caffeine pills. Water. The journal I'd been keeping. My hands moved like they belonged to someone else, clumsy and slow. Each item felt impossibly heavy.

Made it maybe twenty minutes into the forest before I found them. Or they found me. A perfect circle of former watchmen, standing in the pre-dawn light. Waiting. Some wore uniforms from different decades—a catalog of the Brides' victims through the years. Most were so still they might have been statues, but a few swayed gently, like they were listening to some distant music only they could hear.

The exhaustion hits me like a physical wave, but it's different this time. Final. It starts in my bones and radiates outward, turning my muscles to water, my thoughts to mist. My legs fold under me, and I know with terrible certainty that I will never stand again.

I recognize this feeling now. It's not just tiredness. It's surrender. The same thing I've seen in the eyes of every wanderer in these woods. That moment when the last ember of will gutters out, when even breathing feels like too much effort. When existence itself becomes an unbearable weight.

I should be terrified. Should be fighting. But I understand now why none of them run, why they just stand and sway and wait. Fighting requires caring, and whatever's in these woods has drained that from me drop by drop, day by day. All that's left is a vast, empty acceptance.

My mind is already starting to drift. Thoughts slip away before I can grasp them, like trying to hold smoke. But I have enough left—just enough—to write this down. To warn whoever finds it.

The caffeine pills aren't working anymore. My hand can barely hold the pen. Looking at the page, I can see my handwriting deteriorating, the letters becoming shapeless, like my mind is forgetting how they're supposed to look.

I think I'm going to rest now.

Just for a minute.

There's a woman in white standing among the trees. She's watching me, smiling that serene smile they all share. It’s like she knew I wouldn’t make it ‘til Sunday.

Now that I know what they’re looking for, I hope they[ don’t find it.](https://www.reddit.com/user/lemonsorbetstan/comments/1hbq68e/the_brides_of_christendom/)
