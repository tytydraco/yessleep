I should start from the beginning with all this.

Jarrett was my best friend. From the time we were nine, we were inseparable. Always hanging out, always together doing stuff, and, yes, always getting into trouble. From the time I covered for him when he smashed Mrs. McCready’s back window with a baseball by accident (he took off running and I told her I hadn’t seen who did it), to the time we tagged up our high school with spray paint a week after graduation, we were a team.

But then, as time went on and as we grew into adulthood, things changed. 

It started with cocaine. When he first tried it when we were nineteen, he’d told me how great it was, how it made him feel so alive, every synapse firing. I told him I thought it was bad news and he shouldn’t do it, but he didn’t listen. He didn’t fucking listen.

You need to understand, Jarrett had had a rough life. His father was emotionally abusive to him and physically abusive to Jarrett’s mom. For the longest time, he’d always been looking for an escape from this life. With that in mind, it wasn’t much of a surprise he’d have found it in drugs.

Then, a year later, heroin came on the scene. Months after he started that, I started to notice the track marks on his arm. The jitteriness he’d have when he’d been sober for just a couple hours too long. You know what I mean. That’s when I put my foot down. I had a *huge* argument with him over how he needed to *stop*, how this was gonna wreck him. He didn’t listen, wouldn’t even *hear* me, called me a fucking prude and told me to stay out of his business. Knowing what I do now about heroin addiction, I shouldn’t have been surprised.

But I couldn’t do it. That’s what you need to understand - I *could not* sit by and watch a person I loved destroy himself like this. So I cut off contact. And given what I came to learn about him, at the end of his life, I’ll never forgive myself for that. That was a year ago.

Anyways. A few days ago I’d gotten an email from him, my first communication from him since severing ties. The letter was a garbled mess, dude had to have been high when he wrote it. I won’t recount it here, but what I *will* mention is that it ended with the line, “I need you. I really, really need you. My mom and I are living at this address, please come soon.” 

I threw it back and forth in my head for a long while, and finally decided to head over there. 

It was a downtown apartment. I’d gotten there in the evening, and when I let myself into the building (I bullshitted over the intercom to a tenant that I was the police) and then the apartment (he’d always kept a key under the doormat, wherever he lived), it was a calm and quiet night.

What I saw in the apartment, though…I mean, it was a horror show. I….I don’t know how to explain it. I think giving the journal entries first will help.

From Jarrett’s place, I found a USB drive - that and a vial of red powder. When I got home, I sat down at my computer, put the vial on the desk before me, and slotted the USB Drive into my laptop. What came up was the window of the drive’s content, with a singular file - JOURNAL.TXT. This didn’t surprise me - Jarrett had always kept a journal, even from when we were both freshmen in high school.

And here’s where it begins. I honestly dunno what to make of it, so I figured I’d share it here and you could all give me your thoughts on what it is and how I should proceed.

But yeah, without further ado, here it is:

JARRETT GROVE - JOURNAL

**DECEMBER 31, 2024:** Scored something new tonight. My usual dealer for H got snagged up by the cops, and just like you’d fucking expect, it happened at a time when I’m absolutely fiending. His buddy Jonas - he’s this chemist guy, works at a major lab in downtown, crazy right? - spotted me something new, though. It was a baggie of this red power. He calls it, “Mars Dust”. Says it’s a new designer drug, that it would - and I quote - “blow my fucking mind to Alpha Centauri and back” (yeah, he is kind of a weirdo, go figure). The way my mind was, if I couldn’t get heroin, I might as well get the next best thing. 

Got home, just snorted it. Jonas said it’d take a couple hours to kick in, so I’ll write up a trip report tomorrow.

**JANUARY 1, 2025:** My mind. My fucking mind. All the colours, my emotions blaring up, my synapses, holy shit. 

It was a great time. Or it would have been if Mom hadn’t ruined it. I was in my room vibing and she came in, saying in a pissed off tone, “So you’re on something new, huh?” I told her to bug off, that started a big argument, and then she broke down crying and went into her room. This shit always fucking happens.

I’m definitely gonna try to make this stuff last till I can get a new connect for heroin. 

Something odd, though. The skin on my left forearm is really itchy, and looks kind of green. Weird, right?

**JANUARY 4, 2025:** Mom cried and argued a lot. It’s whatever. I took some more of the Mars Dust. Was tripping out for the rest of the day, and felt like I was floating in warm water. So peaceful, so gentle. Best of all, it’s keeping the heroin cravings at bay.

But the come-down was kind of rough. Got a strong sense of fear near the end, like I was being watched by *something* out there. Couldn’t shake it.

My left forearm is a dark green now, really flakey, not itchy anymore. I’ll deal with it later.

**JANUARY 9, 2025:** I don’t know. My neck itches. What? Where are the night stars?

I haven’t heard from Mom in days. She’s shut up in her room. From inside I hear wet, guttural rasping. I’m too afraid to open the door.

More Mars Dust. I need more Mars Dust.

**JANUARY 12, 2025:** I don’t know how long I’ve been gone for. I left my bedroom, and stepped into a different place. It was a long, dark stone alley. I walked for what seemed like forever, and I felt it come up behind me. Something big and wet. I could feel its eyes on me. I ran and ran, my heart beating and pounding. I was so goddamned scared.

Finally, I saw a glint of light, and ran into it, bursting through into my kitchen. I whirled around. Nothing there. 

What’s happening to me? Could it be the Mars Dust? It doesn’t matter, I can’t give it up. What should I do?

**JANUARY 13, 2025:** I tried to stop myself from taking Mars Dust, but I wasn’t strong enough. I feel like my skin is made of electricity. My fingers are sharp now, like talons. I’m hungry.

**JANUARY 15, 2025:** I’m hungry. So hungry. I reach out with my mind, and I think I’ve caught something. I think I’ve caught something. We’ll see.

**JANUARY 17, 2025:** I caught something. A man who works in an office, walking home. I reach out with my mind…and then he walks into my apartment. Their minds, so weak, so *weak*. 

My teeth - so sharp - do the work. So much blood. So much *meat*. 

I don’t know. What’s happening? I don’t know.

**JANUARY 20, 2025:** I caught Mom today. She was picking at the leftovers from the office worker. She looks different now. Scales, sharp teeth. Making scraping noises whenever she moves.  

More Mars Dust.

**JANUARY 21, 2025:** Shaking and crying today. Growling as I pick at the meat of a Mormon missionary I drew in. I know it's coming. I *feel* it coming. I can feel myself being watched. Mom is thudding around in her bedroom on all fours, her hooves pounding hard onto the floor. When will it end? What can I do? 

What even started all of this?

**JANUARY 23, 2025:** I spent all of yesterday in a pitch-black hole. I climbed up back into my bedroom. The floor was closed when I looked back at it a minute later.

**JANUARY 24, 2025:** It’s coming. It’s coming. God help me, it’s coming.

**JANUARY 27, 2025:** Send Tom a message. He will help. Best friend, the best friend I’ve ever had, he will help. The thing got to Mom. She’s gone, completely gone. It will come for me next. 

It’s coming. I roar and snap my jaw into the night, but I know it’s coming. And it is not afraid.

I should now explain what I saw in the apartment. It was a mess, papers and trash covering the floor. But…it also was horrific. There was blood everywhere - some fresh, some that had been drying for days, even weeks. There were three corpses in varying states of decomposition, with huge chunks of their bodies missing, with bite marks surrounding the missing pieces. The smell was ungodly. 

But there was something else. Something that…. I just don’t know what to make of it.

There were dismembered parts of a corpse that I honestly don’t think were even human. 

Green, scaled talons - five fingers, each one with points as sharp as a knife. Chunks of a head with mixed clumps of bright blonde hair and red scales, with eye-balls that looked like a cross between that of a human and a cat. Some parts of the body had been clearly ripped or eaten off, while one limb was….embedded into the apartment floor. As if the floor had been *built around it*.

I don’t know what to make of this shit, so I’m hoping you all could help me. I don’t think I’ll ever see Jarrett or his mother again, and I don’t know if what got to them will get to me.

And that’s another thing.

I can’t stop thinking about the Mars Dust. Whenever I look at it, even though I know it’s very bad news, my heart pounds more and more, harder and harder. My tongue goes dry and I just *want* it. When I’m at work, it’s all I can think of, and when I’m home, I’m always on the verge of opening the vial up. 

I’m afraid I won’t be able to resist taking it. I’d throw it out, just trash the damn stuff down the toilet, but I’m not strong enough to do that, and I don’t know why.

Help. If there’s anything any of you can say to help, I really do need it.
