**First voice message, sent January 7th, 2016:**

"Joshua, it's Emily. Can we please talk? What happened with Mom and Dad isn't your fault."

**Second voice message, sent February 12th, 2016:**

"Sorry to keep pestering you, but things with Sam and I aren't going great right now. I could really use your advice."

**Third voice message, sent September 3rd, 2018:**

"Hey, it's Emily again. I miss you. Please give me a callback."

**September 9th, 2022.**

"Josh?"

"Hey, Em. I just got your message."

"Josh, thank you so much for giving me a callback. I've missed hearing your voice."

"Same. I'm really sorry for not getting in touch sooner. I've just been dealing with everything in my own way. I didn't realize how much time has gone by."

"Don't even worry about it. You're my brother. We're all we've got left."

"How are things with Sam?"

"Good, great, actually. He's just hit his three-year mark for AA. He's been really good to me. That's actually one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you.

"Oh, yeah?"

"Yeah. He proposed to me a few weeks ago. I said yes, but before we set anything up, I hoped you two could talk. Since Dad's not around anymore, I hoped to get your blessing. Funny right? With you being a Priest now and all."

"Very funny. Do you want me to be the one to give you two the go-ahead? I haven't been around that much. I barely know him."

"I'm very sure. Actually, I got Sam to agree to meet with you if it's okay. He's a big hiker. Could you guys take a trip up Mount Lainer together? I get it if you can't, but it'd be nice for you two to spend a day together.

"No, no. That's fine. I'm free next month. Would that work for him?"

"That sounds perfect! I'll send you some texts to finalize the details. I love you, Josh."

"Love you too, Em. Talk to you soon."

The small sedan's trunk slammed shut, sending a booming echo throughout the nearly empty parking lot of Mount Lanier. The noise was rapidly silenced by the overbearing treeline that had enveloped the entirety of the area. A natural concert hall that had kept all sounds from escaping its walls.

It had been a few weeks since Joshua had spoken to Emily on the phone. She had been all too eager to set up the excursion between her Fiance Sam and Joshua. An eagerness that Joshua had found more painful than endearing. The man could count on both of his hands the amount of conversations that he had engaged in with her. Each conversation had only succeeded in making him feel guiltier than the last.

Even so, he had finally put the burden of familial obligations on his back. He knew he would either sink or swim, but unless Joshua flailed his arms, he would never know which way he would manage to go.

With a deep inhale, Father Joshua Moore took in the cripplingly fresh air of the Appalachia. He had always been more of a studious man than a well-traveled one. Yet, in the endless bounds of trees, he found comfort. The wilderness always had a deep place in the literature he loved and the scripture he studied.

The hiking backpack had already felt heavy on his shoulders. Joshua wondered how Sam did it so frequently. According to his sister, he not only hiked often but hiked alone. A concept that weighed heavier on him than the rucksack on his back.

Joshua Moore turned his head over towards the lodge that rested against the entrance of the trail. Sam had gone inside to use the bathroom one final time. A funny thought to Joshua. The preserved and nailed dead flesh of long-forgotten trees provided the feeling of safety far greater than the endless landscape of living giants.

In further consideration, these living giants had seen better days. Fall was coming to an end. The greenery of their leaves had long since turned orange and brown. Twisted branches of bark reached out like thousands of dead arms. Most of them would grasp onto life throughout the winter season. But many had seen their last summer.

"Hey, Father, Joshua, Mr. Moore- I'll be honest, I don't know what to call you." Sam laughed. His muscular and chiseled jawline must've made many men jealous and many women infatuated. He was a heartbreaker. A man Joshua was astonished to know had been with his sister since the accident. The man who had taken up his role as her family.

"Please, Josh is fine. A Priest is never off duty, but maybe God can consider this a personal day for me." The cold late autumn wind found its way through Father Moore's thick winter jacket. A fact that could only be stored in the back of his mind as an amateur miscalculation.

"Perfect, well, Josh, sorry we really haven't talked much before this. Em tried getting ahold of you a few times, but I guess it wasn't just meant to be." There was a brief pause as Sam rethought his choice of words. He continued, "But, tell you what, bought you a parking pass from the rangers. Consider it a donation." Sam gave Joshua a sincere smile. He was trying. Father Moore took note of that.

"Perfect, the coffers of the Church might contain both the treasures of the world and the treasures of the mind; however, my pockets have neither." Both men laughed as they turned to face the path leading in.

It was scheduled to be an overnight stay. There was a small clearing Sam had frequented just large enough for two men to settle into comfortably. A few hours hike, morning to mid-afternoon, followed by setting up camp before sunset. In the morning of the following day, they'd pack up and be out of the parking lot by nightfall. Sam would have Joshua's blessing, and Joshua Moore could neatly pack up his brotherly duties and label them a success.

The entrance to this particular path was a nearly imaginary dirt trail that led through a doddering old cobblestone archway. As the two approached, Sam placed his hand against the cobblestone's masonwork.

"Old tradition, go in with your demons, come out without them. Go home and make merry." Sam turned to look over to Joshua.

"Old tradition," Joshua placed his fingers on his forehead. "In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." Respectively, the older man trailed his hands down his chest to his navel. From there, back up to each shoulder. The sign of the cross.

Sam laughed. His throat caught a gust of cold air, and he broke out in a brief coughing fit.

"Sorry, think I've been fighting something for a while. I'll be good, though. Let's press on."

And so they did.

The path frequently seemed to disappear beneath their feet. Sam marched on with deep conviction. Joshua Moore followed. It was all he could do. Yet he never once questioned Sam. He trusted in his instincts.

That trust continued even as the endless abound of titanic trees surrounded them so fully and completely that you could no longer see your own footprints more than a few feet behind you. Let alone the parking lot they had abandoned so long ago.

The quiet of the woods made each of their footsteps seem awkward. This was a clear indication of the lack of connection between the two. Even so, Sam broke the silence. If only to extend a hand to his future Brother-in-Law.

"So, why a Priest? Em told me you were going into Medicine. Wouldn't that have paid better?" The younger man spoke with a full breath despite the heavy weight of his pack. Joshua Moore's tone fared differently. He was already labored as he continued to ascend the mound.

"Much better. But think I was looking for something else after what happened had, well, happened. Emily had you to take her in. I needed to find the same. Couldn't think of anyone better to do it than God and His Church."

"Aren't those your vows rough, though? Sorry for the religious questions. It's just not every day I get to talk to a Priest. A pastor heads our AA group, but he's a fellow protestant. Baptist, I think. I grew up non-denominational."

"Somedays are worse than others. You still have faith?"

"Hard to say. I think so. Been trying to do better, be better. Just feel alone a lot of the time. You ever feel like that?"

Joshua Moore knew the feeling well. He had faith; he honestly did believe in God. The Church, indeed, was the Bride of Christ. Even so, he frequently cried silently in his car after preaching. He had faith in God but often felt like God had no faith in him.

"It's only natural. God calls us to lament towards Him when we're in pain and feeling alone. There's a whole book just dedicated to that."

"Yeah? What's it called?"

"The Book of Lamentations."

Sam gave out a chuckle. "Yup, that makes sense. Don't you ever get tired of just crying out to God all the time? Ever think there might be a better way?"

"My way would be an awful way. Of all things I question, that one I'm most certain of."

There was silence from Sam. The only remaining conversation came from the crackling of twigs and fallen leaves underneath their feet. That lonely dialogue continued for the next few hours, sparing a few 'watch your heads' and 'careful, loose rocks.'

By the time they had reached Sam's clearing, the sun had kissed the western mountain tops and cast the duo in a pooling orange glow. Three-fourths of the clearing was surrounded by the treeline, and the fourth was a steep drop downwards. The view was immaculate.

Joshua slid his rucksack off his shoulders, and it thudded heavily onto the dirt. He felt his back spasm from its newly found freedom. After a few moments of stretching, Joshua walked over to the cliff's edge. He felt his legs shake slightly. Joshua was so focused on each one of his steps that he failed to realize how far they had climbed up.

The drop-off was steep but caught itself about thirty feet down. From there, it was a much more gradual decline to the mountain's base.

"You think that's a fatal fall?" Joshua asked Sam. Sam nodded as he began to take out his two-man tent.

"That was always my assumption. Beautiful view, though." The younger man said solemnly through his breath. Joshua took one last look out at the cresting sun and nodded in return.

Before long, Sam had set up the tent, and Joshua had gotten a small fire going. A small rock outcropping had already been positioned in the center of the clearing from Sam's previous hikes. It was just a matter of finding dry wood to burn. Which, out in the nearly virgin land they had found themselves in, wasn't very hard to do.

The sun had long since set since the pair had started their work. Now, their only illumination was cast down by endless stars and the quick wisps of their fire. The shadows of the woods danced a miraculous dance around their campsite. Joshua Moore gave a silent prayer within his own mind. He had prayed that God would protect them that night. Once more, a cold chill caught Sam's throat, and he returned to a flem-induced coughing fit.

"Say, always wanted to ask a Priest this: why do they call you Father? Growing up, I was always told never to call anyone by that name."

Joshua stoked the pit's flames with a small, thin branch he had found earlier. This was a question even Joshua had to combat during his conversion. Thankfully for him, he now had the answer.

"'Call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.' That verse gets thrown around a lot. But never in context. Matthew 23:8-10, Jesus insists that we call no man Rabbi, Teacher, Father, or Master. Now, you can take that literally; we'll just remove those words and replace them with synonyms. Or you can take them literally and realize what was intended in context, which is harder to ignore.

'Genesis 45:8, 2 Kings. 2:12, Job 29:16, Isaiah. 22:20–21, 2 Timothy 1:11, 1 Corinthians 12:28.

'These are just a few scripture readings directly relating to calling someone Father or Teacher.

'And let's consider that we fully understand God is Lord of Lords and King of Kings. Even so, Israel demanded a man of Earth to be made a King to lead them. God, in His infinite Grace, granted their prayers. Yet, in his mercy, He provided the new King with a long list of rules to follow.

'As Teachers within the faith, the Church binds us to similar ideals so that we may be judged by both man and God accordingly. Being called a Father isn't a blessing; it's a reminder of what happens to those who betray God's sacraments. The collar is a servant's collar, not a crown.'

Joshua lifted up his eyes from the flames and looked towards Sam. Joshua Moore couldn't make out Sam's feelings or intentions. The campsite felt lonely.

Sam finally let out a sigh and nodded. "I'm glad you're here, Father. Do you mind if I get some time to myself? We've got an early start tomorrow, and I just want to take in the view one last time." Sam's voice carried with it a profoundly sullen tone. Even so, he motioned over towards the open tent with gentle repose.

Joshua tossed his thin stick into the flames, and he stood up. He was tired, his body being that of five years Sam's senior; his muscles had ached, and he carried a deep craving to relax his joints for the night. The older man decided that he would include a prayer to St. Raphael during his nightly devotional. Joshua knew his body would be broken by the time he returned to the state park's entry lot.

"Not a problem at all. Rattle me awake if you need anything." Joshua Moore said as he entered the tent. Sam didn't respond.

It couldn't have been long after Joshua had closed his eyes that a flutter of hot air had stirred within him. His mind had shot itself awake with unseen fury. He glanced around the darkened canvassed tent and couldn't see anything. He reached out towards Sam's bedroll and felt nothing. The pitter-patter of unexpected raindrops had descended down heavily against the fabric flaps of the tent. The sounds of thunder rolled their way through the mountain range with immense purpose.

"Sam?" Joshua called out. It was a quiet attempt. As if from a man trying to avoid disturbing a sleeping passenger on a plane. Joshua cleared his throat and tried again, louder.

No answer. The rain began to fall harder. Lightning now.

Father Moore began to feel uneasy. He felt around Sam's bedroll again. His hand touched something—a damp piece of paper. The Priest raised it towards his face. His eyes struggled to adjust to the ambient light. But he read the first few words and read enough.

'Joshua. Father Moore, I'm sorry for what I've done-'

The Priest shot up in his bed. A feeling of fire ignited inside of him. It couldn't be, he kept repeating to himself. He lurched forward and unzipped the tent. A spray of cold rain cascaded across his face. He was just in time to see Sam standing at the base of the cliff. Joshua Moore called out to him.

Sam gave one look back. Lightning lit up the clearing as if it was midday, its thunder sounding like a rooster's terrified caw, and then Sam jumped.

The next few moments were a blur for Father Moore. Images were imprinted in his mind, taken with the illumination from the lightning-like snaps from a camera. He grabbed his coat. He grabbed his shoes, and he grabbed his prayer bag—the latter of which he couldn't fathom why.

He entered into the downpour of the night sky. The rainfall tumbled like bricks from the darkened clouds overhead. The Priest moved with a purpose, leaving every step he took as an act of faith. A silent prayer that God would spare him the same fate as his companion.

Father Moore couldn't tell if it took a few seconds, a minute, or an hour. But through motion by motion, he made his way down the muddy steps of the overhang. His body was caked with the glistening mud of the now-tumbling Earth. When his feet had touched the base of the ledge underneath their campsite, he initially doubted it. The ground gave way underneath his boots like a foot through water. Even so, after sinking in a few inches, he hit his bedrock.

"Sam!" The Priest called out. His eyes glanced over his environment like a hawk seeking a rabbit. Unparalleled and inexplicably vivid sight had filled his vision—clarity he hadn't seen in years. When the next lightning bolt thunderously ignited light over the area, he had caught a glimpse of a glistening hand outstretched and lamely twisted in the refuse of the muck.

Father Moore stepped as quickly as he could towards the unmoving figure. Each step of his boots stuck him deeply into place. It felt as though hundreds of hands slithered underneath the ground to grab onto his shoes. To tell him, 'No, leave him. Save yourself from the flood.' But he ignored the cluttered demands of the storm's assertions and proceeded forward.

He bent down, sinking his knee into the mud, and grabbed the buried man's hand into his own. He heaved with all his might and inch by inch, the body of Sam was pulled free. Father Moore continued pulling away from the gradual decline of the mountain. Now, it resembled a tumbling slide of muck and mire.

'Please, Lord, let me save him.' Father Moore called out. Whether it was just in his mind or fully realized in speech, he couldn't know. But it became a mantra he kept repeating as he dragged the unresponsive body of Sam towards the lower treeline.

When the Priest's foot hit the near-solid foundation of dirt that lay underneath the canopy of trees, he nearly cried. Or perhaps he did. The rainwater flowed just as effortlessly across his cheeks as any one of his tears could manage.

When Sam was under the protection of the dying leaves overhead, Joshua had taken the time to wipe his face from the rainwater to nearly no reprieve. His hands were covered in mud, just as his face had become. Yet he gained enough vision to see something white jutting out raggedly from Sam's leg. A bone. More specifically, Sam's fibula.

Father Moore's teeth chattered as the cold water washed over his body. He had to act fast, for both their sakes.

There was only one thing the Priest could think to do.

He opened up his prayer bag and slid his hand inside. He felt what he was looking for. A long piece of cloth. His Stole. Father Moore reflexively took the fabric out of his bag and kissed the sewn cross. With a secondary reflex, the Priest tied the Stole above Sam's open wound. The rain had washed the blood out before; now, the blood had begun to pool and spurt.

The Father kept tightening and tightening the Stole on Sam's thigh, and Sam began screaming. Loud, guttural screams. It was as if Sam's body had been consumed in Hellfire. The Priest could do nothing more but continue twisting his improvised tourniquet. Once the blood slowed to a stop, Father Moore looked at Sam.

Sam was staring back at him. His eyes were a shimmering black void, even darker than the oppressive blackness of the woods.

"Filthy Priest," Sam said, his voice cold. His eyes rolled back in his head, and his body went limp.

Father Moore stared at the unconscious man until the storm broke. His adrenaline diminished, his body was broken, and his mind was failing. He fell asleep with Sam in his arms.

He woke up in the morning still clutching Sam. He took his knuckles and slid them up and down the man's sternum. Sam eventually opened his eyes, and Father Moore let out a sigh of relief.

"Joshua? Where are we? What happened?" Sam tried to lean up, but pain shot through his body. His face twisted in vicious spasms. He looked down towards his leg and went silent.

"Why'd you do it?" Joshua asked. There was a silence.

"You wouldn't understand." Sam's voice trailed off. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a cell phone. "Rangers will be out here in a few days if we don't check out today. But if we can reach them, they could be here by midevening."

Joshua looked down at Sam's hand. He was meekly offering up his phone as if begging Joshua not to call. Joshua took it from him and dialed the number.

"Hello, Ranger Station 03. How can I assist you?" The feminine voice was filled with static, barely audible over the screeching of white noise.

"Hello, my name is Joshua Moore. Myself and Samuel Crawford got in some trouble last night during the rainstorm. He's injured pretty badly. I don't think he can move. Can you send someone out?"

"I see your assigned campsite right here on our map. We'll be there in a few hours. Just hunker down for us."

"Thank you so much," Joshua said. A feeling of relief overcame him.

"Of course, Fath-" the voice cut out, the call disconnected. Joshua took the phone from his ear and stared at it momentarily.

"They coming out?" Sam asked, his voice soft, regretful.

"Yeah, just a few hours."

The darkened gray clouds overhead scarcely made a difference between day and night. Even if Joshua wanted to, there would be no way for him to return to civilization with Sam alone. He needed help.

Sam let out a sharp gasp as he reached down towards the bloodied Stole. For a moment, it looked like he wanted to rip it off of his leg. But stopped himself at the last moment.

"You mind dragging me to a tree to rest my back on? Leaning against you is starting to hurt like Hell."

Joshua nodded and slowly heaved the young man towards a large tree trunk. It was made more accessible by the thin layer of mud that had survived on the forest floor.

"I fucked up," Sam said flatly. The back of his head was tightly affixed to the bark behind him. He looked towards the gray skies with tears in his eyes. "Please, don't tell Em about this."

"You know I can't do that," Joshua replied. He sat down across from Sam.

"Isn't that what you Priests do though? Keep secrets?"

"Brother, this isn't a confession, and what you tried to do last night almost killed you."

"Then make it a confession," Sam said. The sorrow in his eyes faded away into something else entirely. Vitriol. His head folded forward. His dark eyes locked with Father Moore's. "I confess, Father." Sam laughed. He laughed. The Priest froze.

"Sam?" Father Moore asked the figure in front of him.

"You know you aren't talking to Sam anymore, right?" The mouth of the man moved, but the voice was not his own. A manifestation. The Priest was no exorcist, but he knew the face of whatever was sitting across from him. Evil. Cruel. It was familiar to him somehow. But it wasn't Sam. After all, Sam was just a stranger.

Father Moore immediately made the sign of the cross and returned to his feet. "In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I command you, what is your name?"

Sam's face appeared to change in the darkness of the overhead canopy. His lips pressed out, and his jaw extended forward. Even then, Father Moore pled for God to make this a dream. A trick of the lighting. But as he continued to watch the young man, the Priest could deny it no longer.

Sam was gone.

"You command me?" The voice squawked towards the Priest before it cooed in a laugh. "You have no authority over me, Priest. You never have."

Father Moore knew that. He knew he held no power. But being confronted with that fact hit his heart.

"Return Samuel to me, depart from us in the name of Christ." The demon twisted its neck sideways.

"You're outmatched, Priest. The pig will not return under your commands unless I want him to. Caenum. Propudium. Make him confess, Priest! Confess!" The Beast chortled and hollard, its head tossed skyward in agony as its voice boomed out towards the edges of the forest and beyond.

In an instant, Sam's body went limp. His face fell lame; his exaggerated facial features fell away into a bleak numbness.

"Sam?" Father Moore called out. No response. He tried again.

Sam wouldn't open his eyes again for several more hours.

"Josh?" The Priest snapped his attention to the young man on the tree.

"Yes, Sam, I'm right here."

"I feel sick. My head is killing me. I keep going in and out and-" Father Moore placed his hand on Samuel's shoulder. Sam recoiled slightly at the touch. "Just focus on staying here with me. You lost a lot of blood last night. Help is coming."

"There's something else in me, Father. I need help." A tear tumbled its way down Sam's features. "It's like it was always in the back of my head, but now it's there. Right there." He gestured one of his fingers towards his temple. Father Moore could see his heartbeat thumping just underneath his skin. It was a migraine. At least, that's all Father Moore could pray.

"Don't focus on it, focus on me. Pray with me." The Priest took Samuel's hands in his. The young man started rocking softly against the tree. He nodded erratically.

'Acceptance of Prayer,' Father Moore thought. 'Now's the time.'

"Listen, repeat the Lord's Prayer with me, okay?"

"Okay, okay," Sam said, his body continued to rock steadily against the trunk of the tree.

"Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name;" Sam began the prayer but faltered at the word 'Father.' The first syllable got caught deep in the young man's throat. Only a dry retch could escape.

"Come on Sam. Again. Get it out.

'Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name;

Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us;

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."

Sam repeated each phrase, his voice broken and his heart contrite. His hefty back now thudded loudly against the tree behind him.

"Now, repeat after me.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee-" Sam screeched at the words.

"Mary is nothing. She's no one. She's a useless bag of flesh God used and discarded. A whore, a tool-" Sam's neck tightened into a mess of veins and muscle. Quickly, he leaned forward towards Father Moore and dug his talon-like fingernails deep into the flesh on his cheek. With a sudden slash, blood had poured from the wound.

Father Moore continued.

"Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen."

"Not her." The Beast in Samuel howled. “Confiteor Deo omnipotenti! Confiteor Deo omnipotenti! Hear his confession, Priest. Hear it. He calls for you. Damn him, Priest. Damn him."

A loud squeal erupted from Sam's mouth as the young man slammed the back of his head against the bark of the trunk. The squeal turned from a scream to a gasp at the impact.

"Denounce me, Father, for I have sinned against you." Sam's eyes filtered their way up to match with Father Moore's. The totality of the man's eyes plunged into never-ending voids. His pupils consumed all.

"You will be blessed for your confession, not denounced, Sam. Confess to God, you're in good company."

Samuel's breath became labored as his eyes began to clear. White outlines started to form around his pupils as the blackness retreated.

"Please, Father, I'm so sorry." Sam cried. His voice caught itself heavy in both grief and regret.

"Go on, Sam, it's okay." Father Moore brought himself closer to the man. His cheek still ran red with blood.

"I abused Em, Father. I hurt her a lot."

Joshua's heart dropped to his stomach. His breath became shallow and sharp. "Continue, Sam." He replied.

"When we first met, I didn't think she'd like me. But I was into her. So I gave her some ecstasy. I slipped it into her drink when she wasn't looking. She never knew."

There was a long pause as Sam heaved. Snot poured out of his formally chiseled face. He looked sick. Disgusting. Joshua saw it.

"She was 17 when you met Sam. You were 19."

"I know, I was fucked up, Father. I was already an alcoholic. I really liked her." 

Joshua's jaw tightened. "Continue."

"The drugs and alcohol took over. I didn't know what I was doing. I would hurt her. I would hit her. I knew she didn't have anywhere else to go. I took advantage of her."

Joshua got closer to Sam. His fist tightly balled up. Sam looked so pathetic at that moment. Crying, whimpering, discarded. Joshua looked down towards the Stole, keeping Sam alive. How easy it would be to untie it. To let the blood flow. That's what Sam wanted anyway. Death. He deserved it. No one would think twice after his fall and with his injuries.

A caw erupted in the back of Father Moore's mind. An unseen reminder. His attention returned to Samuel.

"How long has it been since you've stopped abusing her?"

"Three years. I vowed to get better for her. I got help. I'm trying so hard."

"Do you renounce your actions?"

"I do."

"Then pray with me. Penance for your sins." Sam nodded, his gaze matching Father Moore's. Together, they prayed.

"My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.

In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good, I have sinned against you, whom I should love above all things.

I firmly intend, with your help, to do penance, to sin no more, and to avoid whatever leads me to sin. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, suffered and died for us. In his name, my God, have mercy."

Father Moore looked at the young man in front of him. He could feel it within his heart. Anger, despair, disorder. The images of his sister in need and this man towering over her. But he swallowed back all he could. Hot breaths of flame shot across his skin and through his words.

"May our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, through the grace and mercies of his love for humankind, forgive you all your transgressions.

And I, an unworthy priest, by his power given me, forgive and absolve you from all your sins, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen."

Sam looked at the Priest like a child, and Joshua felt tired. So very tired. His vision faded into darkness at the foot of Sam.

An untold amount of time later, Joshua had woken up to the sound of a voice. It wasn't Sam's. It was feminine, comforting, terrible.

"Listen, hun, we're on our way to your place right now!"

"Your Dad's sleeping right next to me. He had a bit too much to drink at Susan's." "I know, I'll be safe. I've got my glasses with me. It's alright at night. Plus, I haven't seen you in months!"

"Your Father's excited too. I know he doesn't always show it."

Joshua mouthed the words. It was the last phone call his Mother had ever given him, precisely to his memory. Her soothing voice, the sound of their small sedan windshield wipers billowing the freshly fallen snow away, the squeaking of the rubber on glass, it was all there.

Josh looked up to see Samuel standing on both his legs at the forest's edge. His Mother's voice filtered off of his lips.

"We'll be there in 15 minutes. Make sure you stay up for us!"

"Sounds good, love you, bye!"

Then, a dial tone.

"Why'd you leave me, Josh?" the voice of Emily rang out amongst the darkness of the treeline. Sam fell where he stood in a crippled mound of worthless flesh. Yet the voice continued.

"I needed you so much. I kept calling you, and you never answered."

Joshua placed his hands over his ears and curled up on the ground. Prayer had entirely escaped his thoughts, yet the haven of his palms did nothing to prevent his sister's voice from reaching his ears. Her voice was so shatteringly loud that the older man's vision had begun to blur and melt.

"He hurt me, Josh. Every day. Mom and Dad were gone, and you were all I had left." "You asked for this." The older man retorted in desperation. His grip had nearly torn the skin from his ears.

"I asked to be hurt? No. You thought it would be easier to leave your sister with him than to take care of her. I was 17. I didn't know any better. He assaulted me. Then you left me with him. You never even asked who he was."

"I couldn't- I didn't know!" Joshua yelled at the nothingness before him. He scrambled up to his feet. His eyes darted around for salvation but found none. He was guided by fear.

Fear of himself.

So he ran away from the accuser that stood before him and ran into the tree line. There, he was enveloped in a maze of trees and anguished utterances. Darkness overtook him like a tight swaddle over a newborn babe.

Left, right, up and down. It didn't matter. His world was spinning. Even so, he continued to stumble blindly forward.

"You left me, Joshua. Mom and Dad died because of you. Then, you joined the Church for a new family you could love. I'm sorry I wasn't good enough for you."

Another hot breath of air against Joshua's neck. The Priest immediately dropped to his knees and began to pray.

"Hail Mary, full of grace-"

A screeching from the treeline. Father Moore turned to face it. The shadows of the woods conjured up the perturbed image of a giant winged raptor. It was barely visible through the undercarriage of the foliage. The Priest focused on the creature's silhouette. It had turned to meet his gaze with absolute contempt and venom. Its head resembled that of a perverted and degraded rooster. Its beak had twisted around its stuttering skull, fragmented and maimed.

"-the Lord is with thee, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen."

The Priest looked back towards the shadows of the endless forest and saw nothing. The only movement was that of the dancing shade from the moonlight overhead.

Father Moore took in a deep breath and held it. However, his moment of silence was short-lived. A figure slowly hobbled out of the treeline towards him. It was Sam. His face was unrecognizable. Debased and warped, yet still determinedly approaching. The young man limped forward on one leg. The other extremity had long since gone blue and useless. It dragged lamely behind him.

"I bring you salvation, Priest." The creature mocked. Its body stood a mere foot away from the older man. The Beast's darkened eyes had traveled up and down the shattered Priest's body. A sick sense of false compassion overcame the demon's face. "And salvation for this-."

"Don't offer me anything, Demon." A small breath escaped Father Moore's mouth. 'God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, I appeal to your holy name, humbly begging your kindness, that you graciously grant me help against this and every unclean spirit now tormenting this creature of yours; through Christ our Lord-"

The creature cooed and shook vigorously. "Silence, Priest. Hear me now. Allow me into your body, and I will lead you out of these woods."

"I won't be deceived. The Rangers are nearly here-"

"Hello, Ranger Station 03. How can I assist you?" The bird-like man parroted in an echo, its head tilting sporadically to each side. "Help was never coming, Joshua."

Joshua felt his body give way underneath him. There was no help coming. He had been deceived and was now left alone with only this demon of despair as company. Even now, he had run far too far for the Rangers to discover them. Their campsite might as well just be a distant memory. Now, if Joshua would just accept the bargain, he could guarantee his own safety out of the woods. And after that, hopefully, Sam's too.

Just as he was about to agree, a third caw sounded from the back of his brain. A victory cry of despair. A hot flash of breath. In just a moment of final renewal, Father Moore had felt called to make one more stand. With resolve, he stood back up to his blistered feet and looked up towards Sam.

"In the name of our Christ, Sit Demon." Sam shook with fiery indignation. His black eyes staring daggers into the depths of Father Moore's very soul.

"How dare you command me again, Priest." The Beast said as it slowly descended towards the earthen ground. "You are nothing to me-"

"Through the one true authority of God Almighty, what is your name?"

"Is not your Church the true authority? If not, what does that-"

"In the name of God, what is your name?" The creature shrieked out in true vehemence of God's name. Its screams traveled to the edge of the clearing, where they were eaten by the natural walls of the forest's foliage.

"I was thrice the folly of Peter. I was the sleep that befell Gethsemane. I was the tree that held Judas. I am the ever-present in every man. I am Derelictum. I am Abandonment. I am your constant companion, Priest. Know me, for I know you. I spent more time with your Christ than you could ever hope for. And it was men like you that invoked me in his very presence."

"Derelictum, what rite do you have in Samuel? I ask this in the name of our Lord." "He found me at every empty bottle of alcohol. At every late-night adultery spell. At every moment of every day that he had spent with your whore sister. And I was his constant companion. His acceptance. His suicide. I was his witness."

"Demon, what was your purpose in God's plan? What duty was it that you denounced?" Derelictum roared with rolling tides of pain and fury. "I was the interceeder of Saints, the deliverer of miracles, the messenger of grace." Tears welled up in the demon's eyes as the glory of God's plan filled its memories.

"Speak to me now, Samuel, repent. Reject this Demon. Accept the gift of creation, the gift of life. Your sins have been forgiven. Renounce your thoughts of suicide. I ask this with the blessings of all the Saints in heaven."

Sam twisted. His bones popped and shifted unnaturally underneath his skin. He was fighting. Abandonment was screaming in distress with its last throes of death. "Push, Sam. In the name of our Father, repent."

"I- repent," Sam hollered out in defiance to the other being that resided inside of his body. The man's skin grew taught and stretched with every word.

"Do you accept the forgiveness of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?"

"I accept." Sam's eyes spasmed before they darted past the Priest. Through his convulsing, Sam's eyes fixated on something that could not be seen.

"Through the authority of Christ Jesus, I expel this demon out of Samuel and pin him to the foot of the cross so that it may never leave the purview of our Lord again. Amen."

Sam heaved one final time before he crumpled into himself. Joshua reached out to him and brought him into a deep brotherly hug.

"You're okay now. God is with you. You've fought so hard." Sam continued to cry. "I saw her, Father. She was here." Joshua wrapped his comforting hands around the back of Samuel's head. With gentle words, Father Moore lulled the young man back to reality.

"I know Sam. I felt her with us."

It wasn't too much later that the Rangers had arrived. One had reported feeling a hot gust of wind emanating from their direction. She had thought it was their campfire. Instead, it was the Priest with his new brother.

Through some additional time, energy, and compassion, Samuel devoted himself entirely to God. He had lost his leg due to what happened on the mountain, but he had gained a sense of purpose. Emily and Joshua quickly rekindled their familial bond and began speaking regularly.

Joshua knew of loneliness. He had known of Abandonment. But now he has the confidence in him that when the rooster crows, Joshua will stand firm.
