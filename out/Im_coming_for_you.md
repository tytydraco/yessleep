“I’m coming for you.” The message illuminated off my screen. Who or what was coming for me? I got out of my bed and stared out across the ginormous field opposite my house, then hastily shut the curtains. 

I am 17 years old and live in a village in South-East England. I was home alone and messaging this girl on Instagram who used to go to my school and I always kind of liked. I was messaging her on Instagram when suddenly out of the blue I got confidence to ask for her number. Without even thinking I asked. She was typing for a while then replied with “sure” and then sent her number. I messaged the number “hey just checking this is you”. I waited a few minutes before she replied. “Yes it’s me”. That was very strange to me, I’m not sure why. So, I attempted to carry on the conversation as normal, but then out of the blue, she messaged me “I’m coming for you.” As I read that message, I jumped up and shut my curtains, slightly freaked. 

Just as I turned around, I heard a distant car alarm. I opened my curtains again. I saw flashing orange lights across the field from my house. Very far away in the opposite village. Suddenly, a car alarm down the road in my own village started going off, then suddenly the alarms seemed to make their way over to my house, where my own car and my mum’s and dad’s car alarm went off. I began freaking out. I shut my curtains and went back to my phone. I saw a notification from whoever this was. Attachment: 1 image. I opened the message and there was a distant picture of my house from inside a car. All I could safely assume was that this was the car that first went off. I was freaked out now. I went back to the girl’s Instagram. Gone. No trace of it. 

I was pacing my room trying to think what to do. Suddenly, all the alarms stopped. I hesitantly opened the curtains again and looked out. Something about it was off. It felt too quiet. Three knocks. I jumped and turned around. Three knocks at my door. Holy shit. Was this the person that was messaging me? I slowly went down the stairs to the front door. I turned right at the bottom of the stairs and went into the kitchen to grab a knife. I then continued to the front door. Once I got there, I was shaking so much I could barely stand up straight. I put my eye up the peephole. It was the girl I had been messaging. Her clothes were stained with blood. I rushed to open the door and pulled her inside, slamming the door behind her. “What the hell is happening?” I shouted.  “It’s coming” she said. “What?” I said, trying to pretend she didn’t say it. “It wants you” she said. Suddenly, my doorbell rung and the girl, well she almost seemed to disappear into thin air. I hastily looked round the kitchen and then suddenly saw her rocking back and forward on the floor, holding her knees at her chin. 

This time, I quickly went to the front door and put my eye up to the peephole. There was this thing. I can’t even begin to describe how scared it made me. It’s skin was grey, its eyes were black empty voids and its teeth were a mixture of red and white. The creepiest thing was when it turned its glance to the peephole. It seemed to stare directly into my soul. I staggered backwards, everything was hurting. I staggered back into the kitchen, looking for the girl. She was gone from the kitchen completely. I began feeling sick and leant on the kitchen work top for balance. I put the knife down with a loud clang and poured a glass of water and necked it. I picked up the knife and ran back towards the front door. It was open. Suddenly, I couldn’t help but drop the knife and walk back into my bedroom. 

I walked in and this thing was standing there. Its eyes still controlling me. Its boney looked like it was throbbing. I sat down on my
bed and picked up my phone. I was logged into the account on Instagram that the girl had been messaging me from. Suddenly, all the details changed to fit my profile. This thing was groaning in the corner. Pictures that I had never shown anyone were now up on the account. 

I knew what was going to happen for the next few months until this thing was done with me and decided to kill me, like the girl. There was nothing I could do.
