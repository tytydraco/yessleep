This is a story from my childhood. I have long since moved out of... that place, but there's some things that will stay with me forever.

It was the night before Christmas, and the snow had been falling all day, building a thick white blanket outside the window. I had spent the last two hours making a snowman who stood guard by the front door, a snow shovel resting in his frozen hand.

My mother gestured for me to go to bed. I looked to my father, hoping he’d let me stay awake a little longer to catch a glimpse of Santa, but he only shook his head. I knew I had already lost, but I tried anyway.

“But Dad!” I whined. He didn’t even look at me. That was the end of it. I dragged my feet as slowly as possible, waiting for the clock to strike midnight, but my parents weren’t having it.

The chair creaked behind me as my father stood. A moment later, strong arms wrapped around my torso. He lifted me up and carried me down the hall. My mother followed, pulling back the sheets so he could drop me into bed.

They didn’t care that I hadn’t brushed my teeth or changed into pajamas. Before they left, I caught the look in their eyes. They seemed frightened, though I couldn’t imagine why.

The last hour had been strange, but I didn’t think much of it. All I cared about was misbehaving just enough to see Santa. That was my real mistake.

Sleep claimed me fast. The darkness pulled me under.

Then the nightmare began.

I lay on my back, staring at the glow-in-the-dark stars my father had put on the ceiling. They shimmered faintly, giving the whole room a pale green tint. That was when I heard it: footsteps on the roof.

They crept toward the chimney. A low groan followed, then a heavy crash in the living room. Moments later, the bells on the Christmas tree jingled softly.

Silence. My own breathing was suddenly too loud.

Footsteps started again, slow and deliberate, climbing the stairs. They approached my room. The door handle turned. My door gave its usual creak, the one my father had been promising to fix since summer.

I shut my eyes. The steps were too heavy to be my mother. And when my father checked on me, he never came inside.

Whoever this was… did.

The footsteps stopped right beside my bed. A cold touch pressed against my lips. Fingers pried my mouth open.

A soft whisper slithered forth, “These teeth would look perfect on my tree this year.” 

Terror locked every muscle in my body. I couldn’t scream. Pain bloomed as tooth after tooth was pulled free. Blood pooled at the back of my throat, metallic and warm. I kept my eyes clenched shut. I didn’t want to see what stood over me.

The footsteps eventually retreated, moving out of the room. Just before the door closed, I caught a glimpse through barely opened eyes: a pair of red pants disappearing into the hallway.

When I woke, I walked downstairs, numb. It was Christmas morning, but there was no joy left in me. I just needed to find my parents.

My father sat with his coffee and newspaper. My mother was making breakfast.

He smiled when he saw me. I opened my mouth to speak, but only air escaped. My mouth felt… empty.

His smile collapsed. My mother turned, saw my face, and dropped the knife she was holding. Her scream was loud enough that a neighbor rushed over.

My father opened the door and gently pushed me forward. The neighbor looked at me first, then at the plaque beside our door. My mother opened my mouth for him to see.

He didn’t say a word. He simply reached out and carved a third cross onto our plaque. No empty circles left.

Every house had one. Some had no crosses. Others had one for every person inside. It was the simplest way to let others know if you should expect a response.

I guess I wrote this all to say: Santa sees you when you’re sleeping, and he doesn't take too kindly to anyone who peeks.
