I live alone with two cats. There isn’t much excitement filling my nights. It’s just, get home from work, microwave dinner, avoid doing chores, shower, and then mindlessly look at a screen until I fall asleep. I don’t even own anything worth stealing, nor do I own anything that would make anyone think I have anything worth stealing. So, imagine my surprise when I’m getting out of the shower to see my cats bolting into the bathroom away from something loud in the kitchen.That’s when I heard the dude talking. 

All I could think was, “great, I’m about to die naked.” Again, I don’t like guns or violence. I don’t own any kind of weaponry. So, the best I could think of was to put the bass in my voice and get loud. I stomped my way from my bathroom towards my kitchen, holding my towel around my waist. Right when I was about to open my mouth, I saw it.

There was a dude in a hoodie in my kitchen. He was kneeling over another person, straight up eating them. Not polite with a fork and knife either. My guy was wrist deep in guts. In between bites, he kept muttering something about “shouldn’t have done it,” or something like that. Then the smell hit me, like burnt plastic, body odor, and blood. It was all enveloping. My mind just shut off. Without thinking, I rushed at the guy. Just before I was about to hit him, I slipped on some blood and hit the floor hard. He didn’t even turn his head or stop his activity, just kept on munching on this dude. Took me a minute to stand up. Even then, he never once looked in my direction.

My phone was in my bedroom. The bedroom across my kitchen, the kitchen that was covered in blood. Thought about just booking it out and running for help. Thought about just breaking down crying right there. Like I said, I’m not a tough guy. Instead, I just crept through while this guy just kept going. This guy was snapping bones and tearing apart organs with his teeth. Even though I couldn’t take my eyes off of him, I couldn’t really see what the dude even looked like, or even what the person looked like before all of this happened.

I just kept inching my way through the kitchen like someone trying to not wake a bear up fro hibernation. Swear it took me an hour to get to my room. I never stopped looking at these two. There's no way I'd be able to reason with him if he decided I'm next. Each step brought my heart further up my thought. Once I got to my phone, I looked down to unlock it.It was difficult dialing three digits with my shaky hands. 9-1-1. Put the phone to my ear, looked up, and these mf’s were gone. Just gone. No trace that they had ever been there. The blood on the floor was gone too.

“9-1-1, what’s your emergency?” What am I even supposed to say? “Hey, yeah, there was a dude eating another dude in my kitchen, but they’re both gone now?” Yeah, right.“Hello?”“Hey, sorry, I just realized my phone accidentally dialed. Sorry, there’s no emergency.” They asked some questions. I think I had to give them some information, I don’t know. I sat down and my cats joined me. We just stayed there for a while.My shower took 10 minutes tops. There’s no way anyone could have just broken in, gotten into an altercation, and then one of them tear through the other like that. Especially without me hearing anything. The part that's really messing with me, though. How the F\*CK do they just DISAPPEAR? My front door was deadbolted and firmly in place. The windows were shut, none of them busted. No way for them to have come in or out.

I considered maybe I'd finally lost it. No one would believe me. I almost didn’t believe it, but then I looked down at my foot. There was still blood on it from when I slipped. The cops would probably just tell me to lay off the stuff.

My neighbors and I don't talk. We all mind our own and go about our business. I don’t think I’ve ever seen either of these two around before, though.I haven't been able to get the sound of the bones snapping out of my head, or the way his intestines squelched as he bit down on them. There was blood everywhere. What just makes someone do that? I’ve heard of people on bath salts munching on someone’s face, but that’s Florida sh\*t. I’m pretty far from Florida. Still, to just go on with it while another person flops around naked, that’s some other level of spaced out. Then, after all of that, to just leave? Leave immediately. And how is it just gone?

I called off work this morning, said I had a high temp and wasn’t feeling well. Spent the all last night and this morning thinking about this. Tried to reach out to a few people, but what am I supposed to say? People would be concerned and ask too many questions. Questions I can’t answer. I just need someone to understand and know that this happened. I saw a man eating another man in my kitchen last night.
