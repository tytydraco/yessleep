It wasn’t common to get new neighbors in my small town, so I was incredibly surprised when the vacant house next door finally was bought.

The house had always been labeled as haunted so I kept to myself and didn’t bother greeting my new neighbors. I would occasionally spy on them just because I’d at least like to know their faces if they plan on living here at all even if it’s a short while.

They looked like a loving couple, and they seemed nice enough.

A day later I heard someone ringing my doorbell. Now I don’t usually like people and my doorbell has a camera that connects directly to my phone so I unlocked my phone and checked to see who it was.

I almost went into shock after seeing what was at my door. It looked like a monster that shouldn’t even exist in this world.

Mouths where ears and a nose would be and teeth were on top of their eyelids. It looked like something that has only one purpose in life and it was consuming flesh.

The creature next to it was just as hideous with tentacles covering where a mouth should be. The creature didn’t even have real eyes just two glowing red dots in its place.

Like I said before I’m not a people person but a monster person this I had to see, but to my dismay when I opened the door it was just my neighbors with their fake smiles.

They introduce themselves as Azarias and Helias. Odd names that didn’t fit in this town but who cares they were standing in the places of the two monsters I just saw.

I introduced myself as their neighbor nothing more nothing less. They didn’t seem to read the mood I was setting because they didn’t leave nor did they seem the slightest bit uncomfortable. They just said, “Greetings neighbor, we suspect to talk a lot more in the future”.  They proceeded to turn around without another word.

These were weird people I did not like their aura one bit. I then immediately turned my attention back to my doorbell. I decided to ring the doorbell which immediately gave me a notification on my phone. I checked my camera live and yeah.  It was just me standing there no monsters at all.

At this point, I decided I needed more sun or something because hallucinating is never a good sign when you aren’t high.

I went inside and opened the window in my bedroom and opened a couple of curtains around the house. “That should be enough sun and air for today”. Hmmm talking to myself maybe I should get a pet or something being alone all the time has been eating at me.

There’s a shelter near the town so the first thing I did was head that way. Animals without a home need some love so I adopted a 4-year-old cat.  I named her Hope as a sign that there’s always a chance to be loved. I got her all the essentials a cat needs according to the internet and I got her a cute cat bed.  She was a little hesitant at first so I gave her space, let her explore at her own pace, and tried my best not to touch her too much.  She seemed to warm up to her new home and I was incredibly grateful for that. 

Now the day is fresh so I decided to do some spying on the neighbors.

They kept all their curtains closed and it appeared that all the lights were off too. As normal as that was for me that was not something normal for the people around this town or people that just moved here. Usually, the first few days of moving in would be organizing the home. Not sitting in the dark.

I thought about knocking on their door but the house just gives off death and fear. I don’t why anyone would ever buy the house.

I did the next best thing I could. I went home and played with Hope and continued to build a good relationship with her.

The next day I woke up to Hope hissing like crazy at the door. I got up to check on her when immediately I heard the doorbell. I quickly check my phone and again the two monsters from the first time were there but this time they weren’t just standing there. They were facing the camera acknowledging its presence. 

This was way more terrifying than before especially since Hope was freaking out. I ignore people at my door all the time so why not ignore monsters at my door?

That’s when I heard a loud banging on the door. It’s easy to ignore ringing but that knocking sounded like they were going to tear the door down. I quickly grabbed a knife and decided against my better judgment.

As I approached the door my adrenaline was spiking. I could feel a murderous aura coming from the door as the loud bangs continued to ring throughout the house.

I held my breath and…. “Hello, neighbor we hope you weren’t sleeping” Helias smiled as the words slithered out of her mouth. “What do you want” I stated back making sure to emphasize the anger in my voice.

I could hear Hope start to growl behind me and at that very moment, I saw both of their eyes dart straight through me at Hope at the exact same time. I could see the murder in their cold empty eyes so I quickly stepped outside and closed the door.

Their eyes were still Fixated on Hope through the door so I asked again. “What do you want”? That got their attention and in a moment Azarias handed me an envelope and stated, “You’re invited to our home to celebrate our moving in”. I took the envelope and immediately signaled for them to leave.

Again it would appear they were incredibly bad at picking up social cues so I made it more obvious “Is that all”.  Helias smiled and said, “Yes that is all for now, and feel free to invite your pet over as well”.

They turned around and headed straight back to their creepy house.

I also turned around and entered my house

I immediately checked on Hope. She seemed fine now that the neighbors were gone. Hope didn’t really let me touch her though, especially while I was holding the envelope. So I went back to my room and headed towards my window I decided that I am not hallucinating something weird is going on. As I approached my window to close it I could see both of them staring at me from inside their home making eye contact with me. That made me close the curtains faster than usual.

I wonder if they have been hacking my camera and messing with me all this time there’s no way something this creepy is real.

I opened the envelope and it was just the standard invitation except a little childish like a birthday invitation you get in elementary. I threw away the envelope.

Should I really go to a potential monster party? I pondered to myself, I wonder if my other neighbors will be going to this event.

I might not have much to live for but I have just enough to not want to be sacrificed at a possible potential ritual.

I’ll just wait and see what happens to my other neighbors.
