I have always had an issue with believing in religions, not an entity or a creator just in religions, and yet somehow I have a sweet tooth for the supernatural! It might be because my first "experience" was when I was 8/9 years old, my mom still insists it was a nightmare, I now say it was a nightmare but part of me believes! The most recent one, however, was today! I think I accidentally read a story about me and I don't know how to explain that!


A little background before I tell you that, I have three siblings now but back when I had my first encounter, they were only 2 younger sisters and the three of us shared a huge room. Our room had a giant wardrobe that covered a whole wall, a huge glass door, a huge shelves unit for toys and dolls facing 3 beds. 

Honestly, things might have not been that huge but for a kid my size? They were! 

One night, for whatever reason, my sisters were staying at my aunt's and I was home with my parents and grandma but sleeping in our room.

I was settling in my bed enjoying the warm blanket and the light coming through the door when I heard it, it was faint at the beginning and I didn't really put together what it was but after a few seconds of focusing I was sure of it, it was wheezing! 
Sounded like someone was struggling to breathe in the bedroom that has a full wall of dolls, a huge wardrobe and 2 other empty beds! 
I immediately covered my face and started reciting a prayer over and over again, but the wheezing didn't fade,  it didn't stop, it started to become louder! I started to feel like the air is being sucked from the room just for this... thing?? 
Thing yes! This thing can't breathe and it's taking the air in the room in failed attempts to breathe and I'm getting dizzy!? No! Well yes but not because I can't breathe because it's sucking the air, I start to notice that I'm also not shaking because I'm scared! My bed was shaking!?! That didn't make sense! I'm dizzy and shaking because I'm under the blanket over a bed that's shaking!
I could hear the wheezing getting closer and closer, and the bed is starting to shake rapidly, I'm tightening the blanket around me and squeezing my eyes shut it hurts!  I can now hear the wheezing right next to .... Right next to my pillow!! I try and squeeze myself into the blanket in hopes it will swallow me before this thing does. 
A hand is slowly placed on my shoulder! This is it! It got me first! I could feel my heart pounding through my chest when the door opens and I jump from under the blanket finally able to scream, finally able to let out all the quietened hurt beats and taking my breath for what felt like the first time ever sense I was born.

My mom was the one who opened the door greeted by scared shitless yet thankful she's still alive me, she claims that she was woken up by my screams and when I told her that I had only screamed when the door was opened and told her what happened she tried her best to convince me it was "just a bad dream". However, if it was just " just a bad dream" mom, why did you sneakily read more prayers in this room and got us all to pray their on the daily?! And why did you get a holyman to bless it and sent us to stick our faces to the TV in the meantime!?
She'll never admit and I'll never be convinced, the least of it is that I am 100% sure that I had only screamed when the door was opened not a second before!

You would think as a religious woman, my mom would drop the act as we got older and just talk about these things normally instead of denying stuff right? WRONG! LOLA IS HERE! I would have multiple different random incidents or hearing footsteps when everyone is asleep or settled somewhere, wheezing at night or simply hearing her call my name and when I go to her she claims she never called me! 
For my mom, I was too invested and too fucsed and I should find a new hobby, but for me, it was fine because Thing was keeping a proper safe distance.

 It was all fun and games until I got in highschool! I moved to a new solo room yk to be able to study and boy when I tell you that was NOT the fun private room joyride I was looking for after 12+ years of sharing with siblings!
