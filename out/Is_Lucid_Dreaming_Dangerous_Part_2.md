Hello Reddit,

Some of you guys messaged me on Facebook about the gaps between entries. Just so we’re all on the same page I’ll say it here. 

Yes, I’m skipping entries here and there.

I can’t include his entire journal or else I’d have to do like 15 posts. I’m just picking the ones that stood out to me, which are mainly his lucid dreams and his updates. 

His lucid dreams were very special to him, so he put a lot of effort into writing them in detail, and that’s why I’m prioritizing them. 

His non-lucid dreams, not so much. Since he has non-lucid dreams much more often, his entries about them tend to be much shorter and less detailed, that’s why I haven’t included any yet. However, there are a couple of non-lucid dream entries that I will include in THIS post, and I think you’ll see why. 

If the gaps between entries still confuse you, just look at the dates at the top of each entry. I included in parentheses how much time passes between entries. Anyways, here’s the next batch.

**11/9/24 (\~1 week later)** **Entry#5 - Sleep Paralysis (update)**

The nightmare I had last week was so different from any other nightmare I’ve ever had, so I started looking online for answers. 

I thought there was something wrong with me, and like the paralysis was some kind of symptom. Thankfully, I discovered that my experience is actually somewhat common. It even has a name, it’s called sleep paralysis, and it’s totally normal for people to get it every now and then. 

Apparently it can have a variety of causes. It can be caused by a lack of sleep, an irregular sleep schedule, an anxiety disorder, substance abuse, and a lot of other things. I don’t abuse substances and I’m not an anxious person, so I think I got it because WILD must’ve messed with my sleep cycle or something. 

From what I read, the majority of people only experience sleep paralysis for a few minutes. Also, I found that a portion of people who get sleep paralysis also experience “hypnopompic hallucinations” AKA sleep paralysis demons, so I guess that explains the door with the monster behind it. He’s just what I hallucinated I guess lol. Kinda creepy. 

I actually felt so much better reading the stories of other people who’ve experienced sleep paralysis demons. Some people had stories much more terrifying than mine. It was nice to know that what I saw was all in my head, even though it all felt so real. I still hope I never have to go through that again though. 

As I read through more stories, I saw 2 or 3 that referenced seeing a door that their sleep paralysis demon came out of. One of the stories even mentioned that the door had a golden doorknob. 

My interest was piqued. 

It’s crazy to think that other people across the world can hallucinate the same things as me. I started searching things like “sleep paralysis door with golden doorknob” or “sleep paralysis brown door,” and after some scrolling, I actually found an obscure reddit thread about it. 

It only had 5 things on it: the original post, 1 comment, and 3 replies. The original post and the comment both shared their sleep paralysis stories, and they were both pretty concise and somewhat vague. They both made mention of a sleep paralysis demon, but neither described what it looked like. The 2 stories seemed completely unrelated except for 1 thing, both stories mentioned a brown door with a golden doorknob. 

I guess it's just some bizarre coincidence. The comment had 3 replies under it. Some guy replied with, “don’t go near that door” the commenter said “why?” and then the guy said, “he will take your skin”. 

I smiled at first just cause I thought it was such a random thing to say. But then I thought about it a little, and it did kinda creep me out. 

The thread wasn’t that old so I hit reply so I could ask the guy what he meant, but I didn’t have a reddit account. I didn’t wanna create an account, so instead, I just clicked on the guy's profile, and I saw in his history that he comments on a lot of subreddits relating to horror stories and demonology lol. 

He’s just some nutjob, I can’t believe I took his reply seriously smh. 

**11/17/24 (\~1 week later) Entry#13 - Got Sleep Paralysis Again**

It’s been a long time since that nightmare I had when I tried WILD. I decided it was time to give lucid dreaming another try. 

I thought since I had a lot of entries built up that maybe it would increase my chances of having an actual lucid dream. 

There was no way I was gonna do WILD again, so last night I tried FILD for the first time. FILD stands for “Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming” and what I had to do was set an alarm for the middle of the night so that it wakes me up out of REM sleep. Once it wakes me up, I just go right back to sleep; but as I drift off, I focus my mind on moving my two fingers like I’m playing the piano. I’m pretty sure this works the same way that WILD does, cause you’re focusing your mind on something so that you stay awake while your body goes back to sleep. FILD just is a lot easier because you’re already super tired, so you don’t get all itchy and stuff. 

Anyways, I did it last night, and I freaking got sleep paralysis again. 

Thankfully, it wasn’t nearly as terrifying as last time, but when I first realized I was paralyzed, I got so paranoid. 

I was lying on my stomach this time, so it was harder for me to look around. I immediately panicked, and I scanned as much of the room as I could for the brown door, but I didn’t see it. 

I started thinking that if I thought about the door too much, I might accidentally hallucinate it, but thankfully that didn’t happen. No door, no demon, no nightmare. 

Instead, I just laid there feeling claustrophobic and frustrated. I still hated the feeling of not being able to move my body, but at least this time I knew it was something normal and safe, so I was much calmer. 

In my research on sleep paralysis, I read that to break out of it, it’s best to focus on just wiggling a finger or a toe instead of your whole arm. 

I’m so glad I remembered that in the moment because it actually worked. 

I stared hard at my hand and used all of my brain power to wiggle just one of my fingers, and within seconds I was able to break the curse! 

I’m actually so proud of myself! Sleep paralysis is not as bad as I thought, as long as there’s no demon lol. All I had to do was wiggle a finger, I guess it really is that easy. 

I’m still a little disappointed though, I haven't had a single lucid dream yet. So far, every time I’ve tried a technique, it either doesn’t work at all, or I get sleep paralysis. 

I’m sure it’ll work soon if I keep trying, but I’m a little less excited about it cause I’m worried that I’m just gonna keep getting sleep paralysis. 

What if I’m just not compatible or something? Like what if I don’t have the ability to lucid dream? The stuff I’ve read says it takes practice, but they never talk about sleep paralysis. Maybe my body doesn’t have the ability to induce a lucid dream. 

Idk… I really hope that’s not the case. I’ll give FILD another shot tonight, but if I get sleep paralysis again, I might just drop this whole thing.

**11/21/24 (4 days later) Entry #17 - My First Lucid Dream!**

Last night, I had my first lucid dream!!! I actually did it! But I did it in a way that I would’ve never expected. I think I might’ve invented my own way to induce a lucid dream. 

The last few nights I’ve been doing FILD and it hasn’t been working. I’ve just been falling asleep and having normal non-lucid dreams, but last night it worked. 

I set my alarm for 3AM instead of 2AM, I think that’s what did the trick. The alarm woke me up, I did FILD, 

and guess. 

what. 

happened… 

I got sleep paralysis again. 

I looked around the room, and I saw no brown door so that was good. Maybe my hallucination was just a one time thing. But still, the technique didn’t work. I was so upset I wanted to cry, I really thought I would never be able to lucid dream. 

At this point, I actually felt somewhat comfortable with sleep paralysis, so I wasn’t really panicking at all. But while lying there, I had an idea. This whole sleep paralysis thng is in my head, I mean, if I can have hallucinations then that means it's all in my head right? Maybe I can still make it a lucid dream if I just try to intentionally hallucinate things yk? 

I looked around for something simple I could try, and I saw my dresser. I focused and tried to make one of my dresser drawers open. 

At first it didn’t move. I tried again, and I got really serious. I focused hard on which drawer I wanted to open; I imagined the sound it would make and pictured how fast I wanted it to open. And before I knew it, the drawer was open. I couldn’t believe it worked. I was so excited because this meant I could still lucid dream, I just wouldn't be able to move. 

But with that thought came another idea. 

Why shouldn’t I be able to move myself just like I did with the drawer? What if I just Imagine myself moving, won’t that work? It sounds confusing when I try to explain it, but here’s what I did. 

The first thing I tried to do was imagine myself waving my hand in front of my face. It was really weird at first, it felt like I was doing it, like I could feel my arm moving, but my eyes just saw my arm lying still on the bed. I must’ve not been focusing hard enough because I tried again; but this time, I really tried hard to imagine my hand in front of my face. It took a couple seconds, but it slowly flickered into view in front of me. Now I saw two arms in front of me, I saw my left arm lying frozen on the bed, and I saw my other, hallucinated, left arm in front of my face. 

At this point, I wasn’t sure which arm was really mine, but all I knew was that the left arm waving in front of my face was moving and following my commands, while the other left arm was not. 

I didn’t expect this to happen, I don’t know what I thought would happen, but I definitely didn’t expect this. Then I had a thought. What if instead of trying to break the paralysis and wake my body up, how about I just leave my body behind? If I can have 2 left arms, I can have 2 full bodies, right? 

It was a crazy idea, but I went with it anyway. I tried sitting up, I imagined feeling my head rise off the pillow and seeing the floor of my room. What ended up happening was one of the weirdest feelings ever. 

I slowly began sitting up, but it felt like there was a strong rubber band around my head pulling me back down to my pillow. It felt kinda like that spin ride at the fair that makes you stick to the walls. It was like a strong force pulling my head back down to the pillow. 

I pushed and pushed against it, but then I blinked, and I was suddenly lying in my bed again. It was like I just glitched or something, it was really weird. I tried again and I was able to sit up and look over the edge of my bed, but then I lost focus again, and I was back in my original position. 

I tried a few more times and got closer each time. It took so much focus, but when I finally got my feet on the floor, the rubber band feeling went away. 

I felt like I had just broken through some kind of barrier. 

I wanted to check to make sure I was still dreaming, so I counted my fingers. I counted only 8, then I looked again and counted 14. I was definitely still dreaming. 

Then, I turned around to look at my bed, and there I was. I was looking at my own sleeping body in my bed. It was one of the weirdest feelings ever, a real out-of-body experience LOL. 

I was immediately filled with joy. I started running and jumping around singing and yelling about how I finally did it, and how it was my first lucid dream. 

In hindsight, I wish I didn’t get so excited because it ended up cutting the dream short. I ran to my bedroom door, the first thing I was gonna do was fly to school like superman. 

Unfortunately, I didn’t even make it down my stairs. 

I got so excited that I ended up accidentally waking myself up. My first lucid dream only lasted about 10 seconds, but I wasn’t sad at all. I was just so happy that I finally did it, and I did it all on my own. I tried some techniques, they didn’t work, so I made my own solution, and it worked! I’m so proud of myself! I hope I get sleep paralysis again tomorrow so I can try again!

**11/21/24 (same day as previous entry) Entry#18 - Astral Projection (update)**

I did some more research on sleep paralysis. I was trying to find out if there was any info on leaving your body during sleep paralysis. 

I couldn’t find anything relating to sleep paralysis, but I kept getting articles about astral projection. 

Astral projection is basically just an intentional out-of-body experience, where you travel across the “astral plane,” whatever that means. I always thought it was just something out of movies, but it was the closest thing to describing my experience last night. 

I found a lot of people talking about it on quora, and the majority of people on the thread said not to do it. I was looking for skeptics among the replies, but there weren't that many. Most of the people on the thread were convinced that astral projection was somehow dangerous. 

I scrolled through the replies, and the most popular explanation was that astral projection can cause you to stumble across “demonic domains”. 

There’s no way. They stole that straight out of Insidious lol. But I checked the date the thread was posted, and it was actually posted before the movie came out. This was actually one of the oldest quora threads I’ve ever visited. 

Huh… I wonder if the movie Insidious got its inspiration from this thread. Nah, there’s no way, but it's still pretty crazy that the thread exists. 

I’m still gonna do it, but I’m not gonna call it astral projection. I don’t know what “moving across an astral plane” even means, but that’s not what I’m doing, I’m just lucid dreaming. 

I’ll call my technique SPILD which stands for “Sleep Paralysis Induced Lucid Dreaming” and I’ll say it’s a subcategory of FILD. I’m gonna try it again tonight, and if it works, I will try very hard not to get too excited.

**11/26/24 (5 days later) Entry#23 - Dad and the Door (non-lucid dream)**

I tried FILD and it didn’t work, it was another normal dream. I was in Math class and Parker was arguing with Mr. Harp. He was like 

“I’m the smartest kid at this school; you graded my exam wrong!”

 He was so mad he was crying.

 I decided to leave and go to the cafeteria cause I didn’t want him to know I saw him crying. 

The line was super long, so I decided to just look for Jack and Lily instead. I saw them leaving the cafeteria with food, they got food without inviting me. I tried to make eye contact with Jack so that he would feel bad, but neither of them turned around. I was mad, but I tried to act unbothered. 

I asked a kid in line what was for lunch, and he said it was avocado toast. I told him how I think avocado toast is disgusting and then I left. 

I was downtown now, but the streets were completely empty. Everybody was hiding underground because a tornado was coming, and I had 20 seconds to find the door to the underground tunnels or else I’d be killed by the tornado. I could hear it coming, it was getting louder and louder. I tried searching, but I wasn’t able to run properly, and everything just went black. 

I looked forward and saw a streetlamp with a person sitting underneath it. 

It was dad, he was covering his face with his hands like he was sad. I asked him what was wrong, and he just said,

“Please find your mother”. 

I looked up and I was in front of mom’s hospital. 

I knew I needed to get to the roof, so I climbed up the side of the building really fast. When I got to the roof it was empty. 

I heard the swingset sound again, and a chill ran down my spine. 

I turned and saw the brown door standing in the middle of the roof with nothing behind it. The same brown door with the golden doorknob from my sleep paralysis nightmare. I was scared, and I started to back away from it. I tripped and fell off the edge of the building and woke up.

**12/2/24 (\~1 week later) Entry#28 - I Flew to School (lucid dream)**

Last night I finally had my second lucid dream. I was starting to worry that FILD stopped working or something. 

I got sleep paralysis like usual. I checked for any hallucinations, and there weren’t any. 

I started doing SPILD and I was able to do it a lot easier this time. 

Everything was going so smoothly. I kept telling myself not to get too excited like last time. Every time I thought about all the things I could do in this dream, it felt like my feet lifted off the ground a little. If I wasn’t careful, I’d wake myself up. I decided, very calmly, that the first thing I wanted to do was fly to school.

I took a deep breath and headed out front. I imagined myself standing on the roof of my house, and there I was standing on the roof. I stood on the edge and prepared for the jump. 

Now, something I wish I knew about lucid dreams is that doing something like flying actually takes a lot more focus than you’d think. Unless you actually use your brain to intentionally defy physics, then things will just play out like they would in the real world. 

I jumped off the edge of my roof and smacked straight into the ground LOL. 

I peeled myself off the floor and went back on the roof to try again. 

THIS TIME, I made sure to picture myself flying first. I imagined myself levitating, and I decided how high I’d be off the ground and how fast I’d move through the air. I really had to focus.

I took a step off the roof, and it worked. 

I started to feel lightheaded, I knew I was about to wake up. I had to take a moment to calm myself down, then I went for a quick trip around my neighborhood. 

It was just as cool as I thought it would be. From the moment I started lucid dreaming, I wanted to do this. I couldn’t believe it, it was like a dream come true LOL. I flew up over the streets and all the way down to my school. I imagined the bell ringing and seeing all the kids coming out of their classrooms. Mr. Hodges and Mr. Freeburn were the first to see me and they pointed at me in amazement. I flew closer to the ground and all my classmates looked up. The girls screamed and the boys cheered. I saw Jack and Lily in the crowd and Jack had his hands and was all like, 

“How are you doing that??”

I just smiled and flew off back towards home. Everything looked and felt so real, and I felt so cool. I flew back to the house, and I imagined dad standing on the porch watching me. He just stood there watching me with a proud smile. Once I started to get bored of flying around, I thought about what I should try next. 

Then I remembered my whole reason for wanting to start lucid dreaming. 

I smacked my forehead and was like, 

“Now’s my chance to see mom!”.

I felt ashamed that I didn’t think to do that first. I was so focused on doing something cool, that I forgot about the very thing I wanted to do most. 

I started to feel nervous, I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to say, I just wanted to talk to her. I took a moment to think it through. Once my mind was made up, I shut my eyes, and I imagined mom standing there next to dad. 

It’s been so many months since I’ve seen her up and lively, so it took me a second to picture exactly what she looks like. 

Before I could open my eyes, I heard that sound again. 

It was the metal creaking sound from my nightmare. 

My face got hot, and I was filled with a feeling of dread. I became very alert, I looked all around me for the threat, I turned around, and that’s when I saw it. 

It was the door, exactly as I remembered it, brown with a golden handle. 

It felt like I’d jumped into an ice bath, my body got cold, and I lost my breath. I tried to gather myself. I kept telling myself, 

“It’s just a hallucination, it’s just a hallucination, It’s just a hallucination”. 

I kept my eyes on it, and slowly moved back toward my house. I didn’t wanna wait for it to open, but if it did, I was prepared to run. I needed to get back to my body. I was standing outside my front door, eyes still locked on the brown door. I took one last look and bolted into my house and up the stairs. I felt like I was being chased, but I was too scared to look behind me. I ran into my room and saw my body lying in bed. 

I wasted zero time; I dove right into my body, and I immediately woke up. 

I felt dazed and exhausted; I had to keep counting my fingers until I was sure that I was back in reality and was safe. 

I don’t know what made that door appear, I wasn’t thinking about it at all. It appeared all on its own and ruined my dream.

Whenever I get my next lucid dream, I need to make sure I prioritize seeing mom first thing.

**12/6/24 (4 days later) Entry#31 - Mom’s Gone (update)**

4 nights ago, mom went into cardiac arrest and died in her sleep.

That explains why I lost my entry streak. I’ve taken some time and got my thoughts together a little bit. I decided I don’t wanna write about my feelings or else this entry will be 20 pages long 

I simply want to write about the future of this dream journal 

I started doing this whole thing because I couldn’t talk to mom in real life, so I tried to do it in my dreams. 

So far, I’ve been nothing but a failure. I’ve had 2 lucid dreams, and I didn’t talk to her in either of them. Just a few days ago I had the perfect opportunity to, but decided to fly to school instead like a COMPLETE IDIOT! I wasted what was my only opportunity to talk to her while she was still here. 

For the last few weeks, the doctors were saying she wasn’t getting any better, so naturally, I started fearing she might not make it. And now it happened… I didn’t wanna consider the possibility of this happening, I wanted to stay positive, so I always pushed the thoughts to the back of my mind. I told myself that if she didn’t make it, I would let go of this whole lucid dreaming thing, and I’d eventually move past it. 

I knew it would be difficult to let go, but I didn’t expect how I would feel after she died. I guess you never know how you’ll respond to losing somebody until you actually lose them. Part of me knew this was gonna happen, but I didn’t think I would feel this way. 

I know now that there’s no way I’m quitting lucid dreaming. 

I WILL talk to mom, I need to, now, more than ever. And I know I wouldn’t actually be talking to her, I’d be talking to a hallucination, but I really don’t care. I’m really not concerned about what’s real and what’s not, I just want to talk to her. 

I know that at some point I’m gonna have to let it go and move on, but right now, that just feels impossible. I’m sorry, I just don’t think I can handle that. I need to see her at least once before I can even begin to consider that. 

The only thing keeping me together at the moment is the thought of my next lucid dream. I’m gonna get back to writing my dreams in this journal every morning, and I’m bound to get another lucid dream soon. 

If for whatever reason that brown door appears again, I will make it disappear. If something else gets in my way, if I get too excited and wake up, I will just keep trying till it works. I am gonna see her, and I won’t let a stupid door scare me again. 

**12/7/24 (the next day) Entry#32 - The Old Playground (non-lucid nightmare)**

FILD didn’t work, I had a non-lucid dream, but it was a nightmare. 

I was across from the old house, at the playground. I was sitting on the red swing set, the hinges were creaking, making the same sound I heard from behind the brown door. 

I knew what was about to happen, the mean kid was about to show up. 

Somebody showed up, but it wasn’t the mean kid. 

It was mom, but for some reason I still felt on edge. She looked like she was mad at me, but she also looked rlly sick and unhealthy. Despite that, I called out to her and ran to hug her, but she shoved me to the ground. She said, 

“Don’t you touch me”. 

I was shocked, I asked her what was wrong, and what I did. 

She raised her arm to point at me and said, 

“You know what you’ve done…” 

I knew what she meant, and I began to tear up. She looked betrayed, 

“WHY HAVEN’T YOU COME FOR ME??”.  

I felt my heart sink, I knew I was guilty. 

“Mom, I’m trying, I promise, I’m sorry” 

I pleaded, but suddenly something changed, it was like she couldn’t hear me. I continued apologizing, but she wasn’t even looking at me. 

She didn’t look angry anymore, she was frozen still, and her eyes were staring off to the space above me. She looked pale, she looked terrified. I stood up and asked her if she was okay, but she didn’t respond. She started mumbling something, and I had to step closer to hear her. 

“Help me, please… Hurry, please hurry”. 

I started to freak out, 

“Mom what’s happening? What’s wrong?” 

She stopped mumbling for a moment, and then her mouth opened and let out an agonizing scream. I stepped back and was horrified. 

Her skin had fallen off. 

I woke up in the middle of the night and wasn’t able to go back to sleep.

**12/19/24 (\~2 weeks later) Entry#44 - Behind the Brown Door (lucid dream)**

Last night, I had a lucid dream. It’s been a couple weeks since my last lucid dream. You’d think I’d have gotten better at inducing them, but I guess not. 

This was my chance to see mom finally, I wasn’t going to waste this opportunity like I did with my last lucid dream. Ever since I had that nightmare on Feb 19th, I’ve been really anxious to have a lucid dream so I could see her. I know it was just a dream, but it really bothered me for a few days. 

Anyways, last night, FILD randomly decided to work, and I got sleep paralysis like usual. I did the whole SPILD thing, and I sat up on the edge of my bed. 

I wasn’t even gonna get off my bed until I saw mom. 

I closed my eyes and imagined her in my head. My hands started to sweat, I needed to make sure that she was okay. I know that that doesn’t make any sense, but I was just afraid that when I opened my eyes, I would see the version of her I saw in that nightmare. 

I opened my eyes and found myself face to face with the brown door. I jumped back and stood on the bed. 

Everything was quiet, there was no swing set/creaking sound this time for some reason. The only thing I could hear was my heart pounding in my chest. 

The brown door had replaced my bedroom door, so now I couldn’t leave my room. I was scared but also frustrated. 

I know I said I wasn’t gonna let the “stupid door” scare me again, but standing in front of it was a completely different story. Despite how I felt though, I said that if this were to happen that I’d make it disappear. 

I didn’t think it would actually show up again though, there’s definitely something going on here. In my last lucid dream, I tried to see mom, and the door appeared. It’s like it’s trying to stop me from seeing her or like it's trying to scare me or something. 

The more I thought about it, the more my fear became anger. My anger made me feel stronger and braver, so I yelled out loud, 

“This is MY dream! I decide what happens!” 

I walked up and put my finger on the door and said, 

“I refuse to let you stop me from seeing mom!”. 

I had a suspicion that this door was just some kind of manifestation of my fears, and if I stood up to it, maybe it would disappear. 

Despite my flexing, it was still there. 

I stared at it, intending with all my might to make it disappear, but it wouldn’t. I paused for a sec then I tried again and said,

“You’re my hallucination! You will disappear!” 

Still nothing. My anger was slowly turning back into fear and desperation. 

“What if that demon comes back?” 

I tried imagining snapping my fingers and making it vanish. I snapped my fingers. Nothing happened. 

I pointed my hand at the door and imagined fire coming from out of my palms, and immediately, fire came blasting out of my hand, engulfing the door. I put two hands up and doubled the power. I kept blasting it for 10 seconds before stopping, and by that point, my whole room was on fire. I couldn’t see anything through the smoke, but this was an easy fix. I pictured my room without the fire and without the brown door. The fire disappeared, but the door did not. 

Nothing worked, I had no power over this door. 

I started to get frantic, I felt like it could open at any moment, I needed to think of something. I thought maybe I didn’t need to get rid of the door before seeing mom, maybe I should just bring her into the room with me. The thought of having mom in the room with me made me feel much less afraid. 

I shut my eyes and began trying to picture her again. Before I could finish my thought, however, I was hit with the smell of gasoline. 

It was coming. 

My fear became terror, and my dread became panic. My eyes shot open, and without another thought I dove back into my sleeping body. I needed to wake myself up, I wasn’t brave enough to face whatever was behind that door, hallucination or not. 

“I’ll just try again another day” I told myself. 

However, I wish I wasn’t so quick to jump back into my body, because as I woke up, I thought I heard something. 

I’m 90% I heard correctly, but if I stuck around for another second or two, I could’ve been absolutely sure; but I swear, as the dream slowly faded away, I heard mom calling my name from behind the door.
