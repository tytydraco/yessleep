~~Hi all! This is my very first experience in writing, so I am very excited since this is my first publication. Don't judge strictly, because I'm just starting out in this business. I hope you like it and I'll release the next part! Enjoy!~~

  
I am writing this message from the farthest stars that you are able to catch. I have been on your planet for 100 years, studying you, your nature and trying to survive. It was a miracle that I was able to get out of here, because, I admit, your "Earth" does not have a very good reputation throughout the Meta-Galaxy. I want to say right away: I apologize to every subject whose relative/friend/acquaintance/spouse disappeared in the period from 1923 to 2023. The mysterious disappearance of an individual is 99% likely to be on our sinful soul, which forgot about Humanism in its attempts to survive. God forgive us for our deeds.

  
I think I should introduce myself. My name is ███████, I live on the double planet "Sapphire", which revolves around the Engine of Subquark matter, which you call the "Polar Star". This planet is under the control of the galactic empire of Ashtar, but it wasn't like that before.. they were a free republic, somewhat reminiscent of your " Democracy".  
However, Emperor Ashtar was able to take possession of us with his sweet and kind speeches. We couldn't resist, because we ourselves had quite a lot of problems, enemies, questions and other things. However, our happiness did not last long: the Ashtar Empire revealed its true face after a week on our planet, showing us the purest dictatorship.  
At that time, I was a fairly young representative of a criminal society, and my father had already been killed for robbery. I understood that the same fate could await me, but I continued my criminal activities, since I was a young maximalist, and in any nasty way I tried to harm the regime on our planet. But fate was not on my side..  
I, and 3 more of my colleagues in the criminal case: Centauri, Makosha and Ragshi, were eventually caught on the fact that they tried to undermine the building of the central government of Ashtar on this planet.

  
When we were standing in front of the imperial court, I prayed to the Lord God to go to my father, but our creative emperor chose a very original solution.. He decided to send me to you. It's worse than any death, worse than any execution or anything else.  
Many alien peoples have composed legends about a mysterious yellow star near the Milky Way, whose third planet is cursed by gods, spirits and cursed to give birth to a parasitic race that will destroy the galaxy in the future.  
–Oh, my emperor! Please reconsider your decision... – Said my emaciated lips, while hidden hatred lurked in my eyes. At that moment, I didn't even realize the fact that I was humiliating myself in front of someone hated by 79.62% of the entire population of the planet.

  
– Tell me at least one reason not to look at how you are Abstractly melting on that planet?  
\- I will not change my decision, because even the emperor is not supposed to correct the emperor. Oh, and yes, say hello to 12 more of your compatriots... If they haven't finally turned into a semblance of my breakfast - Ashtar whispered bloodthirstily, pulling in ecstasy his ugly, rotten fingers that scratched a huge throne consisting entirely of time. However, I expected this.. Why would he even change to spare?

  
It was monstrously fast, as if I had just closed my humble eyes, and having opened them, I was already in the ship of my last journey. In keeping with our status and position, the ship was in terrible condition.  
It was dirty everywhere, some parts of the hull were rusty (It's a mystery to me how the ship could rust in a dry and oxygen-free environment.), and inside the ship there was very dim lighting.  
Each of us had our own room of two m2 in all directions, where we could spend our free time as we please, because this ship is the only place where there is no all-seeing eye of Ashtar. However, it didn't help us much.

  
The food in the stocks tasted terrible, the drinks were rusty water, and the only pastime was the instructions for the operation of the ship, and a couple of textbooks on Quantum Mechanics. This kind of hobby was enough for us for a maximum of an hour or two, and for me for half an hour at all, since I myself read very quickly.  
However, there was also a passive way of spending time - it was just looking out the window, watching the endless and varied monotony of the cosmic wilderness. But, I'll be honest - this ship moved quite smartly for its condition. The outdated warp engine model could accelerate up to 250% of the speed of light.  
But despite such a furious speed, the distance between us and the Sun was much greater, and it wasn't even the usual distance. In fact, almost all of your measurements of your distance from the stars are very inaccurate and primitive.

  
You have not yet become acquainted with the phenomenon of the Metron, when space-time during superluminal travel is able to open up like a folded leaf, increasing distances tenfold. Unfortunately, this effect only works when traveling at a speed higher than light..  
Your hypersonic vehicles can exhale calmly. However, science is not on the agenda of my message.  
I decided to simply not count the time during the flight, so as not to kill myself morally and not realize how long I have been here. However, I'll be honest, my old comrades in crime have never been revealed so much.

  
Behind the mask of an Anarchist bandit were quite intelligent, conscious and understanding individuals whose speech helped me not to feel lonely. I'm not going to talk about our conversations, because it's not very important. But we were united not only by ideas, but also by a common joy when we saw the Solar System on the course. Why were we happy? It was more of a joy that it would all be over soon, although we rather felt something between joy and horror. Each of us believed in the Lord, each of us lost a person close to us. Being in such a position, is anyone going to fight for life? I don't know.. I'm not the bravest person of all.

  
Having overcome the Heliopause, we saw through the windows a bright yellow star, whose luminosity was changing due to interfering planets, and also watched how an unknown device overcame this very Heliopause, which we overcame. Later I will find out that this device was one of your Voyagers.  
But my head is still numbed by the question of how Voyager was there if it was launched several decades after our arrival? Most likely, these are small temporary anomalies caused by our presence.. However, we will not focus too much on the pieces of iron that we saw for only a couple of seconds.  
We almost instantly found ourselves near our destination - the planet "Earth". I expected to see a red hell filled with suffering and torment but.. My mind and eyes were pierced by the beauty that was studied from your planet.

  
Oceans the color of wine washed your green meadows while olive clouds floated above them.. I will never forget this sight. For a moment we thought that we had been sent not as a punishment, but as a blessing.

  
However, my imaginary hopes were destroyed at the same moment, because like a hallucination, I saw before me how the Earth formed a huge spatial distortion into which it was falling. I watched as the Earth seemed to be looking at me, and for a split second I felt its omnipresence in its own orbit.  
– Hey, ███████! What's wrong with you? – I heard Makoshi's muddy voice, and then a quick and quiet conversation between Centauri and Ragshi, who were clearly concerned about my condition no weaker than Makoshi. 

  
I abruptly opened my eyes (It felt like I had opened them twice), and realized that I had lost consciousness, and we had been on the surface of the planet for a long time. From such clean air of the Earth (Even through a sealed ship) my head started to hurt a lot. However, despite such pain, I still wanted to tell my friends what I observed.

  
–D-did you see that?! - I exclaimed, abruptly jumping up on my hind legs, instantly feeling dizzy due to this kind of change in condition.

  
– What did you see? That's how we were supposed to say it. You have been lying for 10 minutes without any manifestation of life.. Not even a heartbeat. In this state, we could buy lottery tickets if you at least took a breath before you died - Centauri spoke with concern, but at the same time with humor.

  
–I-I... ah.. It looks like it was just a dream.. – We all agreed with this version, forgetting that when the heart stops, dreams do not occur. But at that moment, completely different headlines were thundering in the news of our mind..  
We literally know nothing about this world. We only know that the chance of our death is extremely high. Everything else remained in the ignorance of the fog of thoughts.. Is it worth taking the first step into an unknown world? We didn't want it, and we knew it wasn't worth it, but we couldn't stay in this rusty jar with microchips anymore.  
You scrolled through the huge hatch several times, and opened the door that directly brought us to the local environment. We found ourselves in a place that you call "the forest", somewhere near the city of Houston.

  
"It looks like there is a lot of Nitrogen, Oxygen, Argon and Carbon Dioxide on this planet," I thought then, considering such terrible and unexplored beauties of Carbon nature.  
I myself was a silicon life, but I was able to change my own structure at the atomic level, and therefore decided to assimilate with the local fauna so that oxygen would not turn me into stone. We stood near the forest for probably 5 minutes, which was enough for us in principle.  
I was the only one who heard from afar the howling of "Wolves", the roar of "Bear" and other creatures. I'm afraid to imagine what my comrades heard.

  
– And what should we do now..?– Calmly, or rather humbly asked Makoshi, realizing that he would not hear the answer. We ourselves did not know the way out of the situation. What awaits us? Will the local animals kill us? Are we just going to melt down here? Or will we merge with the local culture, and our children will identify themselves as representatives of "humanity"? I didn't know until then.. None of us could have guessed anything...

  
– First of all, we should at least find out about something here..We'll find a reasonable race here (if there is one, of course), and reincarnate into one of them to get to know everything better. Did you have anything in your books about intelligent life on this planet? - Centauri thought, shifting his reasoning to a more relevant question.  
I thought at first, and then immediately rushed to my room, taking one rather old book, which told a lot about the Earth. I didn't want to read it, so as not to frighten myself once again with information about what I would have to face here.  
However, apparently, it was in vain, because we needed information from this book. Returning to my friends, and turning over a couple of pages, I finally found something that resembled intelligent life.  
"Humen, or Homo sapiens, is the most intelligent species on this planet. Direct descendants of Protoanthropes - the first primates on this planet. A branch of the "Higher Apes" also went from Proto-Anthropes, but this is not very important now. – I told the information what to read from a fancy book. In parallel with this, I showed everyone what a male and female human looks like.

  
– Wow, do they have two genders? – Ragshi said a little ironically - I'm so used to the fact that we refused sexual reproduction that I even forgot about what "gender" is, huh.

  
– Guys, let's not discuss this, okay? - Centauri asked a little nervously, obviously not happy with the topic of conversation.

  
– I agree with him. Let's just reincarnate as people, and that's it? – I continued the Centauri's thought, and everyone generally agreed. 

  
Together we decided to choose the appearance of Caucasian men in their 20s with the usual civilian clothes of those times, and the next day we went to the settlement, which we felt because of various kinds of radio signals, from ordinary radio to banal phone calls.  
– Hah, and people look good! And very well arranged! Damn, our squid-like bodies are just a kindergarten compared to this pile of muscles. I can literally feel every muscle cell connecting with other cells and moving! - Ragshi exclaimed enthusiastically, examining every square centimeter of his human body.

  
– Okay, enough of this nonsense, we need to get busy. – Centauri sternly noted, examining the body of the broken box.

  
– Wait.. Did we crash? - I asked the rest of the company. Still, I was out, and I couldn't know how we landed.

  
– Do you see the holes in the hull? - Ragshi asked with a smile, clearly laughing at my bewilderment – Of course we crashed. Did you think they were going to put us on pillows here or something? According to Ashtar's plan, we had to die at the atmosphere of this planet. But something prevented us...

  
Well, I now realized that the landing was not the softest. How good that our soft and stretchy body structure helped to withstand the impact. I went back into the ship, and entered the captain's cabin, in which the autopilot broke due to the fall. 

  
I saw a small room with a huge number of chips and a panel with a lever in the middle. The panel showed us a rotating Penteract that showed our exact position in space-time.  
– Oh, I read about this technology in the manual – I noticed, after the rest of the group followed me – This device helped the ship to move not only in space, but also in time..  
– Was it possible in those days?  Makosha asked, clearly surprised at the capabilities of our ancestors.  
– Yes, our ancestors used such a device to travel through time – For some reason I repeated my remark. – More than 2 thousand years ago, our people discovered the multidimensionality of time, and the possibility of moving in this very time.

  
I will explain a little for this moment. It's worth paying tribute to your mathematicians - they got pretty close to finding out the Geometry and dimension of the universe.  
Your scientists assumed 3 main models: Closed, flat and open. The most correct form of space-time is a closed form, a five-dimensional hypersphere, in which space closes into itself. I.e., take your Earth as an example:   
"*If you constantly move from one point in the same direction (i.e. forward), then sooner or later you will find yourself in the same place , from which they began their journey. The universe works the same way*".

  
However, this applies not only to space, but also to time! Time, or Timeline, is identical to space and closes in itself. The best example is your "clock", whose time starts at 12, ends at 12, and so on endlessly.   
However, in order for time to lock itself in, at least 2 dimensions are required, because the same one-dimensional line is not capable of being cyclic due to the form factor and only one axis of space.  
The time of the universe itself begins with a Big Bang, and ends with a Big Crunch and again with a Big Bang due to the presence of more than 1 time dimension. With such a system, time travel, i.e. along time axes, is not a paradox or unreality, but a rather realistic idea.

  
– I wonder if this thing is even alive? – Centauri asked a question – We seem to be already aware of the time, the modem can even see and hear it, right? I think it will help us to prevent our imprisonment here!  
Centauri's words were filled with hope, and with this hope he pressed the lever, starting the hidden engine that allows you to move along the time axes.. I tried to stop him, but he was still pretty fast for me.. After a couple of moments, we noticed that nothing was changing outside..   
Even the position of the sun. Although we rewound the time for 7 Big Bangs back..  
"That's it... – Ragshi abruptly changed his face, clearly realizing the futility of absolutely any attempts. – It seems that we have encountered an anomaly outside of time and space. There is no other way to explain why this planet is static.

  
After these words, we instantly heard the incredibly noisy roar of the so-called "bear", and extremely strange... He had more than 13 paws, 4 heads(Each had glowing red eyes), and the claws on each paw were so hot that they even glowed red.  
I didn't know for what reason, but this creature abruptly attacked our ship, clearly wanting to get inside and eat the alien's meat. However, it was a miracle that the Centauri abruptly pulled away from the place, and closed the iron and unyielding door, making several turns clockwise. Didn't I say that the Centauri is very fast?

  
– WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?! - I cried sharply, looking at the whole crew. Centauri puffed very nervously, Ragshi abruptly turned from a merry fellow into a suicide bomber resigned to his fate, Makosha was just sitting in his room, obviously coinciding with Ragshi by his condition.  
 It was strange how the most merry people of our team so quickly deflated in their mood. Although, I could understand them, because not everyone can morally survive their own demise.  
– Damn it! Is there a weapon around here?! – Panting Centauri uttered, instantly running away from the door in search of any weapons. Everything went into the supervision of the search: Boxes, everything under the table, private rooms, books, etc. – How I hate this world.. There are no weapons anywhere.

  
– How many times do I have to repeat to you, buddy? – said Ragshi, looking at the Centauri with a stern look. At that moment, I had a suspicion that there was something like Bipolar disorder in Ragshi, because he was smiling and laughing at the top of his voice just a couple of minutes ago.  
However, in the future it will turn out that my suspicions were correct. – We were sent here to die here, and not as a gesture of mercy of the "Supreme and Mighty Emperor". And what do you think, Centauri.. With such goals, are these imperial freaks going to give us at least something to survive? We need to either accept it or find another way.

  
Centauri silently headed to the captain's cabin, and started the lever for time travel.. As expected, there was no effect, and that strange bear was still making pretty good attempts to open this ship.  
He knew it wouldn't work, but Ragshi infected Centauri with his own despair and humility..  
Every 15-20 seconds I heard a series of blows, the sounds of metal scratching, an extremely strange growl and felt all the shock energy of an Earthly being on myself. It can be compared to your torture with cold drops of water. However, such auditory torture could turn into physical at any moment, the bear only needs to tear off the iron door, and then our heads. When I can't do anything physically, I look into my own mind. What is the reason for the appearance of this creature? Why is it here? How to get rid of it? Or rather, from them?..

  
Thinking about these questions, I sat down on the floor under the closed window, reviewing everything that had happened to me all the time. The Emperor, punishment, exile, Earth, a strange dream, time travel and a mysterious bear consisting of bears.. It was my most interesting life in life. However, reading these messages, you understand that I survived.. But at that moment, time seemed to stop for me. And, by the way, even stopping in the time dimension did not help in any way - the bear was still doing damage to our ship.

  
At that moment, I thought about a certain metaphysical nature of this animal. I remembered about that strange dream.. Maybe I'm crazy, but.. What if Earth is trying to kill us?.. This thought sounded crazy, but it was the only explanation for all the horror we faced. I had a strange dream where the Earth figured, also a time machine does not work on this planet, and also, for no reason at all, a beast appeared on which time manipulation also did not work.

  
At that moment, even my atheistic subconscious accepted faith in the Lord, because I wanted to live very much.. How we have changed over these times. From unwillingness to desire, and from desire to unwillingness. The phrase is very well suited to this situation: "You want death until you come face to face with it." I didn't want to die, so I decided to turn on my brain to the fullest, and find something that would help kill this animal. I could transform into him, but my physical characteristics will lag behind.. But you can try to make weapons from improvised materials! There is quite a lot of junk in this place from past crew members who used to use this ship for interstellar travel, and not to be sent to hard labor.. I told this idea to Centauri, but at first he was very skeptical about it, although he still agreed because of the animal instinct of self-preservation.

  
After about 5 minutes, we found some good items for creating weapons, but there was a much worse problem - the Bear began to open the hatch like a canned lid, clearly getting to his treats. It was good that "time" played into our hands, and we made something like a weapon. But at the same moment, when we saw the huge jaws of the bear, we felt a certain inferiority of ourselves in front of him, because of our weapons there were only explosive shells and incredibly sharp pieces of iron (Sharpened to 1 atom). A moment later, the peeking muzzle turned into a full-fledged body, when the bear nevertheless opened the hatch, abruptly breaking into our own iron trap.

Makosha and Ragshi had disappeared somewhere (But, most likely, they were in their rooms, waiting for their fate), and we were standing in front of a multi-headed beast. But we could no longer stand opposite, because this monster began to run at us at such a speed that none of the people would react to such a thing. However, we were capable of it, and despite the fear, we still went into battle with the beast.

  
The bear growled, and we just silently and humbly aggressively ran in his direction. We wanted to die in his paws, but at the same time we wanted to cut his carotid artery and turn it into meat puree. The distance is small, the look is crazy, the time is irrelevant. And....
