I needed the money. That’s the only reason I signed up for the sleep study.

It was simple: seven nights in a controlled environment, wired up to monitors, and £1000 at the end of it. The ad said they were researching the effects of “micro-disturbances during REM sleep.” I didn’t know what that meant and I didn’t particularly care. I was behind on rent and living off instant noodles.

The facility was just outside Bristol—clean, white, sterile. I met the lead researcher, Dr. Horne. She was pleasant but cold, and everything about the place felt overly quiet. There were five of us in total. Each of us had our own identical room with a bed, a camera, and a small monitor that tracked our vitals.

The first two nights were uneventful. I fell asleep easily, woke up groggy, and filled out a questionnaire each morning.

Then came night three.

I woke up around 3 a.m., heart pounding, and looked straight at the camera above the door. I don’t know why—I just felt like I *should*. The red light was blinking rapidly, faster than before.

Then I noticed something on the monitor screen beside me. A new graph. “Intrusion Signal.” It spiked sharply every few minutes.

I mentioned it the next morning. Dr. Horne just smiled and said, “Perfect. That’s exactly what we’re hoping for.”

That night, I dreamed someone was sitting on my chest. I couldn’t move or scream. All I could see were hands — long fingers pressed against my ribs, like they were counting them. When I woke up, my chest ached, like I’d been compressed.

I tried to quit, but they told me the payment was contingent on completing the full week. I needed the money. So I stayed.

By night five, things were... different.

The room felt colder. I started hearing sounds—scraping, like nails on metal, and whispering in a language I couldn’t place. My dreams were turning into something else. Not dreams. *Memories that weren’t mine.*

One of the other participants, a guy named Ellis, vanished that night. We were told he had “an adverse reaction” and had been sent home.

But his room stayed locked.

The next morning, my vitals chart had been replaced by a new one labeled “Integration Progress.” It was... high. Off the charts. I asked what that meant, and Dr. Horne’s face twitched with the first real expression I’d seen.

She said, “You’re adapting faster than we thought. You’re almost ready.”

Ready for *what*, I asked.

She didn’t answer.

That night, the door to my room didn’t lock.

The camera turned off.

And at exactly 3:13 a.m., the lights went out.

I lay there in the dark, holding my breath, heart thudding like a war drum. Then I heard it—breathing. Not mine. Slow. Heavy. Right next to my bed.

And then a voice whispered, in perfect imitation of my own:

**“I think I’ll keep this body.”**

I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t move. I blacked out.

When I woke, I was still in the bed, wires detached, the camera gone. A nurse came in and told me the study was over.

Dr. Horne was nowhere to be found. Neither were the other participants.

I went home.

But I haven’t been the same.

I don’t sleep anymore.

Because every time I close my eyes, I feel something shifting behind them. Like I’m being watched from the inside.

And sometimes, when I speak, it’s not quite my voice.

It’s deeper.

Hungrier. Ever so hungry.

At least I paid my rent.
