I turned slowly, locking eyes with Sġail. That smug, arrogant smile was still plastered across his face as he stood in the center of the room. Around him, the children—barely conscious—struggled to lift their heads, their eyes flickering between us. I stepped forward, my voice low but shaking with fury.

“Why?”

He shrugged, casual. “Money. Same reason people sell drugs and run guns.”

“They’re children. Kids with their whole lives ahead of them.”

Sġail tilted his head, amused. “Do you know what children are? A commodity. Second only to women and animals. That’s the market.”

I felt my stomach turn. “How the hell have you kept this hidden? Where do they go? The police would notice if kids started vanishing near a royal estate.”

“The police are in on it,” he said, almost bored. “So are social workers, teachers, care home staff. Anyone in a position of trust. We’ve got a chain of laser tag zones across the UK. We monitor the kids who can be sold. They’re led into a back room, taken here. Parents are neutralized. Then we auction them off in the castle’s ballroom. Buyers? Businessmen. Politicians. Even high-ranking police and military—some still in uniform.”

I stared at him, disgusted. “You’re sick. Beyond sick. And now what? You kill me? People will notice I’m gone.”

He smiled wider. “You’re not my first. Close your eyes. Wait for the light. I’ll make it quick.”

He pulled out a micro Uzi. I knew the moment he fired, I’d be dead before I hit the floor. So I closed my eyes. My heart thundered in my chest.

Then—thwack.

I opened them to see Sġail collapsed on the ground. My best friend stood over him in a tuxedo, gripping a fire extinguisher. He checked for a pulse. Still alive. Just unconscious.

We didn’t waste time. I pointed to the children. He nodded, and together we smashed the locks, freeing them. Then we took Sġail’s car, sped up the ramp, and escaped the underground hell beneath Balmoral.

As the estate disappeared in the rearview mirror, my thoughts kept circling back to the kids. I prayed they’d find their way out.

Once we reached my place, I demanded answers. Real ones. Did he know about his superiors’ involvement? How deep did it go?

He sighed, rubbing his face. Then he told me everything.

“I found out two years ago,” he said. “I was visiting the brigadier’s home. Gorgeous place. But I saw a door with a latch on the outside. Curiosity got the better of me. Inside was a girl—maybe eleven—shackled to a bed. Bruised. Broken. Then I heard a camera click. The brigadier threatened to release the photo, make it look like I was the abuser. So I stayed quiet. Every time a child went missing, I turned off the news. The guilt’s been eating me alive.”

I nodded, trying to absorb it all. Then I asked about Sġail.

“That’s not his real name,” he said. “Sġail means ‘shadow’ in Scottish Gaelic. His real name is Aubrey Sinclair. He launders money for the founders—ex-drug lords who expanded into this... enterprise. But I don’t think he’s deep in it. Just a middleman. A broker between suppliers and buyers.”

I didn’t speak. Just sat there, the weight of it pressing down on me.

Tomorrow, I’ll start dismantling this. Piece by piece. Brick by brick.

This ends now.
