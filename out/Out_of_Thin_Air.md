[Part 3 - A Momentary Lapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hnq5d8/a_momentary_lapse/)

When my body was stolen from me by it, a torrent of emotions and thoughts flooded my mind. Anger, fear, and despair intertwined with questions about my existence. What defines me now that I can only watch my body move against my will? Will it live my life better than I ever could? The entity acknowledged me only once, smirking at my soul through a mirror a month ago.

My thoughts raced incessantly. Does it want to use my body briefly to explore Earth? Does it seek to experience the pleasures and pains of being human? Will it ever give my body back to me?

I clung to the hope that it would, once it accomplished whatever it was meant to. But that hope shattered the moment I saw it attempting to hurt Alice. This beautiful, strong woman whom I had never officially met but hoped to one day. It might never happen now.

No matter the cost, I resolved to never let my body hurt another human being.

After stabbing my body’s left arm with my right hand, it suddenly lost control of its powers, causing Alice to drop to the ground from its levitation trick. She quickly recovered, grabbing her handgun and pointing it straight at my head. I mirrored her actions, taking the knife from my right arm and aiming it at my neck.

It started laughing in a high-pitched electronic sound without moving my mouth or using my voice box. The eerie sound seemed to emanate from inside my nose.

“This is by far the most unique response from humans I have ever seen,” it said, again in that high-pitched electronic voice. “The host willing to kill its own body to protect a stranger, and the stranger willing to face a danger not of this world. Most humans would either run away or do nothing. I shall document this.”

“What the hell are you talking about?” Alice yelled, her voice steady despite the fear in her eyes as she aimed the gun and slowly approached.

“This probe is almost spent. Time to finish this. Personally,” it said.

I suddenly felt a sharp, searing pain in my left arm, like a hot needle piercing through my flesh. I could move my eyes up, down, left, and right, and I managed to wiggle my legs. For a fleeting moment, a sense of sublime relief washed over me as I realized I had regained control of my body. But that feeling quickly turned to terror when I felt a tiny metal sphere exit my left nostril, its cold, metallic surface brushing against my skin, and hover ominously between Alice and me. 

“Shoot it! Shoot it now!” I yelled at Alice, pointing at the metal sphere.

She fired all six shots from her revolver, trying to destroy it, but missed. Searing hot pain shot through my left shoulder, and I realized she had hit me in the process.

While Alice reloaded, I noticed something strange in the air surrounding the sphere. It shimmered like a mirage. Then, suddenly, a tall, slender figure seemed to step out of thin air. It appeared humanoid, with dark grey skin and two legs. Its arms were hidden behind an unusual garment that kept changing color with no discernible pattern. Sometimes it would turn into a perfect mirror.

The figure was skinnier than Alice, who was petite to begin with, but it stood tall—maybe eight feet tall. Its head was tall and thin, hidden behind a shiny metal helmet that acted as a perfect mirror. Where its face should have been was a dark void. It hovered roughly a foot above the ground.

As I stared straight into that dark void, a cacophony of voices erupted in my head. It felt like thousands of them, each one piercing my mind with unbearable intensity. I clamped my hands over my ears and squeezed my eyes shut, but it was no use—the voices wouldn't stop.

Amidst the chaos, I heard the distinct sound of a revolver being cocked, followed by the deafening roar of gunshots. The voices abruptly ceased. I opened my eyes to see its back facing me, turned towards Alice. Its right arm, with four long slender fingers, was extended as if signaling something to stop. To my astonishment, it had halted the bullets mid-air. They hovered in front of it, dancing slowly as if under its control.

Suddenly, the bullets stopped moving and oriented themselves towards Alice. Instinctively, I sprinted towards it, desperate to tackle it before it could return the bullets to their sender. My effort seemed to work as the bullets clattered to the ground. But before I could make contact, it turned to face me, revealing four arms—two on each side. With a synchronized motion of its arms, I was lifted off the ground and hurled through the kitchen wall with extraordinary force.

I crashed into the living room, screaming in agony as I saw and felt the bone protruding from my lower left arm, broken in half.

Through the hole in the wall, I saw it levitating towards Alice. She appeared frozen in place, either paralyzed by fear or held against her will. Without a second thought, I forced myself to stand, ignoring the searing pain in my broken arm. I tried to sprint towards it, but both of my ankles were sprained, making it impossible to run.

Desperation surged through me. With no other option, I yelled at the top of my lungs, “What do you want from us?!”

It turned towards me, and I heard thousands of voices laughing, a cacophony that echoed in my mind. I covered my ears and squeezed my eyes shut, trying to block out the overwhelming noise.

I forced my eyes open despite the laughter and noticed it slowly approaching me. My heart pounded in my chest as I walked backward as fast as I could while still facing it.

“Run, Alice! Run!” I shouted, my voice cracking with fear. She complied, immediately sprinting out of the kitchen, away from me and this thing.

My back met the cold, hard wall of the living room. It continued its slow approach towards me, stopping just a foot away. It revealed one of its right arms and slowly moved it towards me as if in a grabbing motion. I closed my eyes, bracing for the inevitable, as there was nothing I could do, no direction to run.

But I heard nothing, felt nothing. I opened my eyes and noticed it had stopped its hand in place, directing its eyeless gaze from me to the ground beneath my feet.

Suddenly, I levitated and was thrown violently against the living room wall. The impact sent me crashing outside, under a clear, dark, starry sky, near the main entrance of the farmhouse. Searing pain radiated through my body, this time in the left side of my rib cage. Each breath was a struggle, sharp and shallow.

I heard footsteps running towards me. I looked in that direction and saw Alice, sprinting towards me with a shotgun. She leaned next to me, scanning for the thing. When she noticed it in the living room through the hole in the side of her house, she asked, “Are you okay? Do you know what the hell is going on here?”

Before I could answer, I saw the air around us filled with shimmering particles, dancing and moving. Each one was extremely bright, with colors changing irregularly, creating an almost hypnotic display.

I glanced back at the thing and noticed it was moving its arms synchronously in a circular motion, as if stuck in some sort of ritual. Did it find something it was looking for? Did it have such great importance that it would ignore us?

I told Alice, “I don’t think it wants us anymore.” I motioned towards the thing. “I think it found something more important than us. We need to leave. Now.”

I quickly surveyed my surroundings and saw her car parked maybe 20 yards away. I tried to stand up but fell immediately, feeling a sharp crack in my right ankle.

“Shit! I can’t move! Go on without me! Leave while you can!” I said to Alice, my voice strained with pain.

She hesitated for a moment, then replied, “I don’t know who you are, but I am not taking orders from you. Either we leave together or die trying. Get up on your feet! Now!”

She crouched down and lifted me to my feet, positioning herself as a support while I wobbled towards her car.

In a matter of seconds, the particles vibrated faster. The ground began to shake violently. We looked back and saw the farmhouse slowly fading out of existence. Only the thing remained solid.

As we reached the car, Alice unlocked the doors and helped me into the passenger seat. She then rushed to the driver’s side and started the car.

When the engine roared to life, I saw the particles slowly approaching the thing, with no trace of the farmhouse ever existing, gathering into a shimmering bright sphere of many colors next to it. The thing slowly faced us, and I felt its gaze pierce through my mind.

All the dancing particles disappeared into the sphere, which grew to almost the size of the farmhouse. Both the thing and the sphere shimmered synchronously with vibrant colors. Then the sphere started to slowly sink into the earth.

The car sped away, with Alice driving us out of there. She merged onto the country road, and a minute later, we saw a huge burst of bright white light, followed by a loud explosive roar.

We felt a shockwave, and the car veered off the road, flipping upside down. The world spun around me, and everything went black.

I must have passed out for an hour or so, as I awoke to the cool night air and the concerned faces of a couple of good-hearted people. Alice recognized them as the young couple, Elliot and Sylvia, who lived a few miles from her farmhouse. They gently helped us into their van and drove us towards the hospital.

Alice asked them to stop by her farmhouse first to see what had happened to her land. After a few minutes, they stopped by the land, but the house was gone. We gasped as we saw a nearly perfect half-spherical hole in the ground the size of her farmhouse.

Elliot brought out his flashlight and investigated the hole. As he shone it at the center, we saw a perfect cylindrical indent, maybe a yard deep and a yard in diameter.

As we got back into the van and headed towards the hospital, my mind raced with thoughts. There had been something beneath the earth, and it had found it. The realization sent a chill down my spine. What kind of power had we unwittingly stumbled upon?

I glanced at Alice, her face illuminated by the passing streetlights. She looked exhausted. I wondered if she felt the same lingering dread that I did. Whatever it was that the entity sought, I prayed we would never encounter it again.

Yet, deep in my mind, I could still hear that faint, familiar laughter and feel its strong gaze. It echoed in the recesses of my thoughts, a haunting reminder of that thing’s presence. The sound was both mocking and ominous, hinting at secrets beyond my understanding.

In that moment, I knew this was far from over. The entity had found what it was looking for, but its interest in us might not be entirely gone. The thought filled me with a sense of impending doom. This was not the last time we would cross paths with whatever malevolent force had invaded our lives.
