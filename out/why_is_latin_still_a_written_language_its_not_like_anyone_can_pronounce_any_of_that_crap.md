i can’t stand this anymore. i’ve been clawing at my skin, my teeth bleed and my knuckles ache. ive tried posting this to different subreddits but they keep getting removed. this is my last resort. this is my last chance.

i’ve always been into weird shit. when i was fourteen, i tried really hard to sacrifice a dead bird i found to give my mom eternal life. so, yeah, i was a little off my rocker and all but it was for a good cause. she was always sick. my dad said it was a miracle she didn’t die giving birth to me. but he always said it in a tone where, like… you wonder if that wasn’t what he wanted to begin with.

anyway, that was a long time ago. my moms dead and i wish my dad was. that’s how this stupid shit started. after i dropped out of high school, i moved out before my dad even found out. my boyfriend joey let me live with him in his shitty section 8 apartment. i say it was shitty and it was but fuck if i didn’t wish i could just go back. 

i helped out. i got a job at a bookstore downtown. joey was proud of me. i never got that kind of recognition at home, but i didn’t really try either. maybe i just wanted someone to be proud of me just for existing. no, i know i did. 

how fucking childish. i know that now. i really do.

i worked with a this girl; manny, short for manuela. i liked her, but i mostly liked that she was pretty. her voice was hard to listen to and she made this disgusting smacking sound with her lips whenever she sipped on her diet coke. i asked her where she was from once and she said italy. is manuela an italian name? am i that fucking uncultured? was she just fucking with me?

i don’t know but everything adds up in the end. that’s why she was the first to end up in the boiler room of the apartment.

we got a shipment of new books in and it was usually stuff one of the sister stores couldn’t sell. i feel like most of the “stock” we ever got was just leftovers from a better store. 

i just stocked the shelves, put things back, things like that, but i knew i was just annoying for manny. maybe that’s why i didn’t like her, why i made fun of her sometimes. i didn’t do great in high school, even in english so like, i don’t know, was catcher in the rye horror? does racism count as horror? jordan peele acts like it does. is it historical because it’s set in the past? pride and prejudice acts like it is. dude i don’t fucking know.

but she was on lunch and so it was just me. i remember being sat at the register with a box i brought in from the back. i was just setting them in piles on the floor. you know, chiseled ab covers with the romance books and swirly galaxies with the science fiction books. i was only barely trying. of fucking course she was annoyed with me.

anyways, i didnt find a book. not some fucking necronomicon that i definitely wouldn’t fucking touch because the last time i tried something like that, a flock of birds flew out of our chimney and pecked me so bad i was afraid of the little shits for years. i wouldn’t fucking try it.

i found a piece of paper, but it was thick and a rectangle. you know. a post card. 

“the only way to deal with this life meaningfully is to find one’s passion and to commit to it.”

i flipped it over to look at the picture but it was stained over, looked like with coffee or something. one of those round blackish rings. or maybe that was the art. bookish people drink coffee, right? bookworms or whatever.

i kept looking at the postcard. until i found something i couldn’t even pronounce. i couldn’t then. 

“Alimenta me, ego sum vacuitas, quae semper sumit.”

it’s difficult to say. i’m not sure most people can, right? can you?

i didn’t think much of it, just tossed it back in like trash and kept sorting. by the time i was done, it was closing time and manny was back, “fixing” my organized piles again. i barely said bye to her before i set out to the street, hoping to maybe make it home before joey so i could surprise him with food.

no i don’t cook. i’m not the type of girl who cooks. but i am the type to remember he wants a large chow mein, half crispy, half soft noodles with fried tofu but the crispy and soft need to be in two separate containers. 

think i’m done?

extra bean sprouts, no carrots, only green onions, absolutely no cilantro (he thinks it tastes like soap) and don’t cook it in peanut oil.

i’m almost certain every chinese spot spots in his food. i would.

i picked up his order and mine (large pork lo mein. i’m simple) from the jade spoon and i rushed home.

he was back first with his work boots on our couch again. i mean it was his couch. but like it was our couch. i wanted to open up his two noodle containers and dump them on top of his head. i wasn’t rational most days. i was just angry to be angry. a lot like my dad really.

joey let a lot of stuff go. or maybe he liked me for it. could have even loved me for it.

i slammed the door hard to wake him up and he almost fell off the couch. i still remember how his black hair flopped in front of his eyes and he blew the strands up like some kinda suave cartoon character.

it’s making me sick just thinking about it.

he kisses me and he tastes like cigarettes and hubba bubba bubble gum that he didn’t chew long enough to get rid of the nicotine. i wanted to push him away, and throw a tube of toothpaste at him, honestly. but i missed him. i wished he’d tasted more like cigarettes than gum he would have never bought if it weren’t for me.

we ate together. our table was wobbly so we sat on the floor together.

“how’s manny from italy?” 

“why are you even asking about her?”

i was too on edge. but i had a migraine, anyways, probably from all the fucking MSG they put in everything. still, i stole a little of joeys noodles. i liked taking his stuff. made it feel like he liked me more.

the migraine only got worse though. i went to bed and woke up and i could feel my heart pounding in my temples with the weight of bricks. i was sitting by the toilet for most of the morning until joey had to get ready for work. when he saw how sick i was, he stayed at the apartment though.

i heard him in the living room telling marcia (his boss) that he had a family emergency. i think that made me puke more than the migraine.

he heated up our leftovers from last night and made some kind of broth to put my noodles into. i didn’t have the heart to tell him oily noodles and water don’t mix. it’s the thought that counts, right? it’s the thoughts that started to become the problem, though.

like i overheard him on the phone, i swore i could hear him whispering things about me. 

“stupid bitch made me take off work.”

“she didn’t even graduate high school, of course she can’t take care of herself.”

“i have to cancel my date with manny.”

i kept plopping the noodles from high above the bowl to the murky broth joey made for me. this incessant plop plop plop that sent tiny drops of sodium laden juice on the carpet.

our apartment was going to smell like chicken and pork until i fucking died. i shouldn’t play with my food when i’m upset. i should just say something what the fuck is wrong with me

“you didn’t need to take off, you know.” 

that’s all i said.

i don’t remember what he said at all. i remember him kissing my forehead and wrapping his arms around me. i remember that he smelled purely of cigarettes since he hadn’t left the house this morning. pure cigarettes. my favorite cologne.

it was what i loved about joey. he was soft. a jaw breaker with the gooiest center. like having your first Guinness. i could hear the snap, crackle and hiss of the beer bottle just before he brought me close and whispered, “Alimenta me, ego sum vacuitas, quae semper sumit.”

mannys crying again. i can hear her. i need to go tend to that i guess.
