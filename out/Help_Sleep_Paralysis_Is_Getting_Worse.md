A little context first. All my life I lived in my parents house. I went to a college in the same town so never really had the need to move out.


So when I recently got a new job offer with a good salary in a different city. It was a no-brainer. New city, new job, new life. Like any hot-blooded youth, I hopped on the opportunity I didn't think twice before relocating near my new workplace. 


Although finding a good rental wasn't possible with the lack of initial funds. I still kept looking and eventually stumbled on a rental that was cheap and close to the new office.


To be honest, it wasn't bad for the price range so I couldn't complain a whole lot. I moved into the shitty one room apartment but since it was my first time living alone it was the best shitty apartment I could ask for. Accompanied with the low rent and complete freedom it became the perfect man cave. My man cave.


Soon enough I was on the job. Those first few days were the best time of my life. I made new friends at the office and with the Saturdays off we fucked around every weekend. Hell, even the girl I liked had started to reciprocate the affection.


But somehow shit hit the fan after that perfect first month.


It started with the occasional sleep paralysis. I would wake up in the middle of the night with no control over my body. Stare at the ceiling for a few minutes and eventually fall back asleep. Standard protocol for anyone who has ever experienced a sleep paralysis episode.


I searched the internet for causes and quick fixes. Apparently, it's caused by an inconsistent sleeping schedule. Which wasn't that hard to fix. Skipping a few night outs, I somehow had a consistent schedule of going to sleep around 12-1 am.  


But things never got better after the first night, yes it's somehow gradually getting worse.


Everyday, every single day in the middle of the night my eyes shoot open. I trust everyone reading this knows just how frustrating it is to not be able to move.


My body stuck to the mattress with this phantom pain in my chest. Like someone left a few dumbbells on my chest. It sucks to say the least but lately, out of the corner of my eye I have started to see a shadow move in the darkness of my room. And the reason behind why I'm making this post.


Keeping my eyes closed has worked so far. And nothing paranormal has happened like my blankets getting pulled or anything. But needless to say it's affecting me mentally. 


I have tried sleeping pills yet I still wake up in the middle of the night.


One weekend I just said fuck it. I went ahead, downing as much alcohol as I could before getting back home. That day I hit the sack knowing I will be knocked out for good.


But nope. I woke up, even in that delirious state with my head pounding I fucking woke up. Feeling a strange sensation of being watched. 


Drunk out of my mind I still did not dare to try and open my eyes. My breath caught in my throat, with the helplessness brought on by the sleep paralysis. In between all that I can still feel a presence watching me from some dark corner of the room. It's a surreal experience almost like some primal instinct telling me to keep my eyes closed. 


It has been a month since I moved in, hopefully the creepy thing that keeps me company is just that, a creepy thing I imagined. I'll keep you guys updated on the situation. Meanwhile if you guys have any suggestions to get rid of this problem please let me know.

P.s. I don't want any advice on moving out. I already signed a 6 month agreement.
