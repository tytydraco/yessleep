What would you do if a video from an unknown number showed *you*—bloody and terrified—begging yourself not to go outside tonight? It sounds like viral clickbait or a cheap jump scare, right? That’s exactly what I thought… until I saw my own eyes on that screen. 

They weren’t the eyes of someone playing a prank. They were the eyes of someone who knew exactly how their life was about to end. But terrified — like a man watching his own death happen in real time.

It was around 11:15 PM when my phone vibrated with a new email. I was finishing some design work in my tiny Seattle apartment, half-eating leftover fries, half-listening to the wind throw loose debris against the balcony glass. I nearly ignored the notification — until I saw the subject line.

*“NATHAN.”*

The message contained nothing but a single video attachment: *DON’T GO TONIGHT.*  
I thought it was spam, maybe a prank. I pressed play anyway.

The face on my screen was my own… but it looked like me after a fight I didn’t remember being in. A deep bruise swallowed the right side of my cheek. My bottom lip was split and raw. Blood had dried in jagged streaks across my shirt. My eyes — usually sleepy — were wide and frantic.

Future-me whispered as if trying not to be heard by something nearby.  
“Listen to me. Please. Don’t go outside tonight. You won’t come b—”

Something yanked him backward — violently. His head slammed out of view.  
A hoarse, choking gasp. A crash.  
The recording ended.

I sat frozen. My heart didn’t know whether to race or stop entirely. Confusion morphed into dread when the screen blinked and the email deleted itself. The video too. Gone like it never existed.

My room suddenly felt too cold. The shadows too thick. I re-checked every lock.

But then my phone buzzed again — this time a text from my friend Liam:

“Beer? The guys are already at O’Malley’s. Don’t bail.”

I typed back: *Not tonight*… but before I tapped send, a new message appeared.  
From my own number.

*GO.*  
*YOU CAN CHANGE IT.*  
*TRUST ME.*

A chill went through me like an electric shock buried under the skin.

Two versions of me.  
Two opposite commands.

One trying to save me…  
One taunting me?

I didn’t know what to believe anymore, but some stubborn, reckless instinct whispered that maybe I could prove the first video wrong. That I could outsmart fate.

So I grabbed my jacket.

The hallway lights flickered as I stepped out. The elevator’s metal walls amplified every breath with an eerie echo — as if someone breathed right beside me. When the doors slid open at the ground floor, a gust of icy wind shoved through the lobby like it wanted me to turn around. I felt eyes on me though no one stood there.

The street outside looked like a forgotten movie set — empty, still, too quiet. The wind dragged a crushed soda can across the asphalt with a scraping sound like skeletal fingers. As I neared the corner, my phone buzzed again.

*TURN BACK.*  
*DON’T PASS THE ALLEY.*

The alley beside O’Malley’s bar was pitch-black — a gaping mouth between buildings. The streetlight over it flickered sickly, buzzing louder the closer I stepped. Something metallic clattered deeper in the darkness, followed by a whisper — soft, guttural — impossible to understand.

Every instinct said avoid it.

So I crossed the street, putting distance between the darkness and me.

That’s when a black van flew around the corner.

Tires screamed.  
I dove sideways.  
The mirror grazed my ribs, ripping cloth and skin.

My pulse thundered through my whole body. One more step and I’d be paste. My phone lit up again, another message:

*GOOD. KEEP GOING.*

My own voice, inside my skull, whispered: *See? You’re already changing things.*

Or so I believed.

Inside the bar, the warmth and noise hit me like a wave — drunken laughter, glasses clinking, music vibrating through the floorboards. Liam spotted me and grinned, slapping my shoulder. For a moment, the nightmare outside seemed like a hallucination.

Then the televisions flickered and all at once every screen in the bar went black.

A single face appeared — my own.  
Bruised. Terrified.  
Just like the video.

His whispered voice echoed through the bar speakers:

“Run.”

I barely had time to react before the glass window beside us exploded inward. People screamed. Liam’s face twisted in shock as a bullet punched through his chest, spraying my shirt with warm blood. His weight collapsed onto me, dead or dying.

Chaos detonated around us — overturned stools, breaking bottles, desperate cries. I pulled Liam down behind a booth. My phone buzzed in my pocket.

A new notification.

Another video of future-me.

In the video, he was lying exactly as I was now — face pressed to the floor, hand slick with blood, eyes staring wide at something behind me.

He gasped out one word:  
“Now.”

A muzzle flash lit up the room.

The second bullet hit me.

My side erupted into agony — a white-hot fire chewing through my lung. I collapsed harder against the floor, choking on blood as the shooter bolted into the night.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

My vision darkened. My heartbeat stuttered. Everything slowed.

And then… I recognized the moment.

The neon sign above me flickering.  
The cold tile beneath my cheek.  
Liam’s lifeless fingers curled against my jacket.  
The way my breathing rasped in jagged bursts.

I had already seen this — in the video.

This wasn’t a warning.  
This was a memory.

A memory I had just created.

In that horrifying clarity, I understood:

I am not avoiding fate.  
I am fulfilling it.

Every move I made — every attempt to dodge danger — guided me here perfectly. Fate isn’t a path you follow. It’s a trap that closes in no matter which direction you run.

My hand trembled as I reached for my phone. I could barely keep my grip as blood slicked the screen. The camera app opened automatically — as if the phone already knew what I needed to do.

A red record light blinked.

I saw myself reflected — bruised forming, fear burning in my eyes exactly as I remembered. I hit record.

“Listen,” I whispered through pain. “Don’t go out tonight. You won’t come b—”

My voice broke. My body jerked. The phone slipped from my fingers, crashed to the ground — just like in the original clip. My scream cut off exactly the same way.

The phone, as if controlled by something unseen, attached the video to an email already drafted to me.

SUBJECT: *NATHAN*  
SEND

A final breath left me as my finger brushed the screen.

The world turned into a tunnel of blurring lights and fading sirens.

My last thought wasn’t of the shooter…  
or Liam…  
or even death.

It was the sickening realization that this is how fate works.

Not a prophecy.  
Not a warning.

A loop.

A sentence.

A design that uses you to confirm itself.

Tomorrow night, the me who opens that email will believe he can avoid all this.

But he won’t.

Because destiny doesn’t need your permission.

Destiny only needs your participation.
