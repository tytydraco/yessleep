The others posted here before, so I think this subreddit might be my only hope.  

To give you some context, I haven't been on Reddit in about a decade - which makes what I'm about to write even weirder than it already is. 

I've recently gotten really into a well known online D&D show, and I'd heard that there's a pretty active community for it on Reddit, so I ventured over here to check it out. I fully expected to have to create a new account, because it's been SO long since I even considered visiting Reddit. 

My phone had already logged me into this account. 

There's every possibility that I'm wrong, but I don't recognise this username. When I created my account, I was probably still in the "HufflepuffBabeXOXO" username stage, and I can't interpret "glaotastala" as anything resembling that. Still, I figured maybe it was some kind of throwaway account name, or a randomly generated string of letters, and not too weird in itself. 

Then I checked the posting history. For the most part, I wanted to see if any of my old, cringe-worthy comments in Harry Potter subreddits were still around, because it would be a laugh. Part of me was also a little curious to see if there were any clues as to the origin of my old username.  

If you take a quick glance at my posting history, you'll understand why I'm freaked out. Here are a couple of links to old threads "I" - I'm using quotation marks here, because it definitely wasn't me - posted: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8alcbk/we_get_some_weird_calls_in_ambulance_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b79ows/i_think_ive_been_here_before_but_i_dont_know_how/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  . 

Five years ago, glaotastala was someone called Holly, who worked in an ambulance control room. Then some really weird stuff happened - test calls and disappearances and things that all sound so far-fetched, it's ridiculous - and then she posted some garbled message and disappeared off the face of the earth. 

Then, two years later, some random woman called Rowan starts posting on the account, and it turns out she seems to be weirdly linked to Holly in various ways, and she's working in ambulance control too, and some of Holly's colleagues, who disappeared, had turned up around her but in a really different way. 

Keeping up so far? Well done, you're doing better than I am. It's really confusing. 

Now, here's the thing that I'm finding really weird. My name isn't Holly, nor is it Rowan. I've never pretended to be someone else on Reddit, and I've certainly never posted on here about the sort of things they wrote about. 

Still, their posts are on "my" account, and I was logged into this automatically. My phone was brand new before I got it, my passwords are basically impossible to guess and I've never had my computer hacked (as far as I'm aware). The account is linked to the email address I've had since I was about seven. 

There's more to it, too. Three months ago, I got a new job - something I've wanted to do my entire life. If you're familiar with my account's posting history, I don't think you'll be surprised to hear that my job is in a call centre. 

It isn't an ambulance control room, and no one disappears without a trace. That's part of the problem, though. I don't think we're the call centre that receives the test calls. 

I think we're the one that makes them. 

My department deals with inbound calls, and we're basically like outsourced receptionists - we take messages for really busy companies and promise them a call back. One minute I'm talking to someone looking to speak with their solicitor, the next I'm promising someone that their complaint about a bad donut is being taken seriously. 

I don't know if the Test Department are part of our company, or if they just share the building, but that's what they're called - the Test Department. We have very little to do with them - certainly nothing in terms of job interaction, and whenever we do see them in communal areas around the office, they don't really interact. They seem to be in their own little world most of the time. I sometimes catch them glaring at me, though. 

I don't know what hours they work. I never seem to see them in the car park. We occasionally pass in corridors. Once or twice, they pop onto our floor and speak to the supervisors, and it always seems to be about something really serious. 

Last week, I was sent on an errand. As one of the newest workers, it's not unusual - the more experienced staff do their best to stay at their desks all day, and they talk about the Testing Department with grimaces and shudders. I was pretty curious, to be honest, so I agreed to take a note up to the department. 

The note was sealed in a brown envelope with thick brown tape, so I couldn't have seen what the message was, even if I'd wanted to. At this point, I didn't think anything weird was going on. 

The Testing Department was access controlled, like our office space. I tried my access pass but the light flashed red, and the door didn't open. 

Almost immediately, there was a face at the small, darkened window in the door. A very pale woman stared at me for an uncomfortably long time, and I wondered if she was waiting for me to speak. Just as I was about to turn and walk away, the door swung open, and it was like the woman had disappeared. 

I've worked in a couple of call centres, and there's always chatting going on. People gossiping or arguing or listening to music or on calls with people - there's always a general hubbub in the room. 

This massive office space was totally silent. I couldn't even hear keyboards being tapped or phones ringing. There were rows of what I presumed were workstations, but they were all totally hidden from view by tall, black panels. 

The pale woman seemed to appear from nowhere. She held out a hand, without speaking, and I handed over the envelope. She didn't tell me to leave, so I stood around awkwardly as she tore open the envelope with an almost-unnaturally long fingernail, teased out the note from within and read it. 

Her eyes seemed to flicker from the note, to me, then back to the note. I didn't know how to feel about this. Then the ends of her lips curled in a vague approximation of a smile, and she nodded towards the door. I understood this as my cue to leave. 

Before the door closed behind me, I heard one solitary voice - somewhere between human and robotic; a strange mix of that automated voice on phone lines and an actual person. 

"This is a test call". 

At this point, I didn't think much of it. Their name is the Testing Department, after all - their remit would be tests of some kind. Plus, phone lines get tested all the time. 

Now, however, there's this weird coincidence or bug or whatever going on with my Reddit username. What's more, I really didn't like the way the pale woman looked at me as she was reading the note. Now I can't help but wonder if there's more to all of this than I realise.
