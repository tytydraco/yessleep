As we opened the front door, we were met with a chaotic spectacle; Lamp posts floating several feet in the air, Roads winding up and downward, Cars filled with some tendrils that were similar to the book's tendrils, buildings warped and twisted and nobody was anywhere to be seen.

Cody Took out a notepad and started sketching something and then showed us the map of the city before the incident.

"Do you think this is still accurate"? I asked, turning to Emily.

She scoffs, "Of course not, just look at the roads for gods sake...But I wonder if we could use this old map to traverse some areas that are filled with illusions". Emily concluded.

"Well, we should go look for St. Georges first, that's most likely where George Is". Cody Added.

We walked through a row of cars, peering inside to see if anything was still functional...

Sadly, everything had been twisted or warped in some kind of way.

We Approached An intersection when we heard a guttural growl to our right. I turned just in time to see a humanoid figure running towards us, their limbs were bent and twisted at odd angles, making them look like some kind of puppet. I quickly dodged to the left but Cody wasn't so lucky; He was slammed to the ground and a loud thud was heard as Cody's head was slammed into the sidewalk, blood seeping from his head to form a sickly red puddle on the ground as he went limp.

Emily lunged at the creature and stabbed it repeatedly with the kitchen knife, watching it slowly die as it let out several loud screeches. Emily wiped sweat off her forehead; the air in this city seemed to be much hotter than normal.

Suddenly, we heard several more guttural screeching and to our horror, there were now three more creatures surrounding me and Emily. I took out George's Gun and fired off a shot, hurting my arm and grazing one of the creatures in their neck. It was enough to make them wary as they all took defensive positions to try and close in on us. I motioned for Emily to go get Cody and get out of here. She looked confused but trusted that I could handle this.

The creatures seemed to not care about Emily And Cody as they closed in on me...

I took a deep breath and ran towards them, grabbing one of the creatures and firing a bullet into their skull. My arm screamed in pain as well as the hole in my chest as the other two creatures tackled me to the ground, scratching me with their abnormally long fingernails. I gritted my teeth and shot another two bullets, one of them missing and another latching deep into one of the creatures arm. They kept clawing at me, trying to quickly subdue me. Scratch and scratch, blood trickled from my body as I desperately tried to fire off the gun accurately.

Bang. Miss.

Bang. Miss.

Bang...

A direct hit in the neck of one of the creatures. They collapsed in black, oily, blood, as the other who was shot in the arm, backed away, clearly surprised I was not dead. I wiped some blood off my chin and aimed the gun with my trembling arm. The creature saw this and charged, knowing that running away would not help itself.

The creature was almost on me, leaving me only half a second to react and in that moment I managed to fumble my gun and it dropped the floor, the creature accidentally bumping it out of my hands.

I quickly backed up but the creature knew it had won. It charged and I quickly ducked behind a car, the creature tumbling over me, onto the hard-surfaced road.

I ran desperately, seeing a bar that had its doors wide open. I rushed inside and quickly closed the door, holding it shut as the creature banged against it, letting out another screech in anger.

I knew I didn't have much time so I quickly looked around while making sure I barricaded the door with nearby heavy objects.

As the creature banged on the barricaded door, I looked for any exits and conveniently there was a back door leading outside to some kind of alleyway.

As I entered the alleyway, I heard a human-like scream from above, I looked up to see large, pitch black spiders with human faces that resembled citizens in the city looking down at me with their empty eyes.

"What the hell-" I went to say but was cut off from the creature slamming his hand through the back door. I didn't have much time to get out of here.

I quickly ran through the alleyway, dodging and weaving between trash cans and discarded objects.

I turned back to see the spiders tying the creature in some sickly yellow webs. At first I was relieved but then I realized I was gonna be next if I didn't find some sort of hiding place.

I made my way back to the intersection and called out for Emily and Cody, only to be met with silence.

I heard scuttling behind me and realized that the spiders were almost here. I ran towards the nearby buildings, looking for a way inside but a lot of their doors were twisted beyond recognition. I ran to a door that was almost in the same familiar shape as a normal door and saw a small trail of blood leading inside. I ran in only to see I was in a small room that stretched upward for what seemed like hundreds of feet.

I heard a faint yell and it sounded like Cody but it was high off the ground and sounded like an echo. Determined, I made my way up the building using various objects such as floating staircases and desks that somehow could support my weight.

I climbed for what felt like hours until I made my way to some kind of balcony door on the side of the building.  I opened it, only to be met with Emily who was tending to Cody, stopping the bleeding from his head with some medical supplies.

She turned to me and seemed shocked.

"What happened to you"?! She asked hysterically.

"What..."? I asked.

She pointed at the several cuts all over my body.

"Oh that's just from the creatures". I said.

She sighs, and laid an unconscious Cody on some cloth.

"How did you get him up here"? I asked.

"I was able to push him up with those weightless objects you climbed up with". She said bluntly.

"But they didn't move when I used them" I said.

"Did You Try Pushing Them Upwards"? She asked.

I was silent.

"Did you actually climb your way up here"?! She asked, now shocked.

We Both Went Silent as we heard some human screaming below

"Oh my god there's survivors"! Emily was about to go down to help them but I stopped her.

"No, They are spider things with human heads. They are trying to lure us out". I said.

"How do you know they aren't actual people"! She asked frantically.

"Because they followed me". I said grimly.

&#x200B;

"you...you led them to us"?! She looked terrified.

"I-I Didn't Mean to- I-" I tried to say but she cut me off.

"No. You should have known". She said, grabbing Cody and hoisting him onto her back.

"There's a fire escape we can use to get out of here". She sighed.

I sighed with relief but that relief was short lived as a sickly yellow web barely missed me. They were here.

&#x200B;

We Ran to the fire escape connected to the balcony, desperately rushing to get away from the spiders. I heard a human groan as one of the spiders flung themselves towards Emily and Cody. I yelled for Emily to watch out and she was surprisingly able to stab the spider in the neck, mid-air. I was surprised she managed to do that with Cody weighing her down but brushed it off as we needed to get going.

We started descending the fire escape but halfway down the fire escape starting leaning to the side, sending us sliding towards the edge of the fire escape. I grabbed onto the railing and Grabbed Emily's hand, sending immense strain to my arm as i held us all from falling off the fire escape.

I tried pulling myself up so I could pull Emily Up as well But I heard the skittering of the spiders and realized we needed to jump.

"Emily we have to jump"! I yelled.

"What?! Are you INSANE"?!! She screamed.

"Just Trust ME"! I yelled, preparing to let go.

"Kyle-"! Emily warned but it was too late; One of the remaining spiders slammed into me, sending me flying and Emily And Cody fell down onto the last platform on the fire escape. I desperately grabbed into the sickly yellow webs and they immediately started burning through my flesh. I screamed in agony but held on, swinging myself on the webs to maneuver myself back onto the fire escape.

I desperately grabbed onto the railing as I watched Emily trying to fend off the two spiders but to no avail. She couldn't attack them AND protect Cody and herself from their webs. 

My fingers started giving out as the burns were making my hand feel weak and numb, I pushed forward, forcing myself onto the last platform.

Emily Managed to stab one of them in their head, killing them in their weak spot. Though, the other spider did not take too kindly to that and rammed into Emily, Sending her flying in my direction. She slammed into the platform, near where I was standing. 

"Are you okay"? I asked.

"Obviously Not". She said, gritting her teeth as the spider was upon us.

"Wheres Your knife"?! I asked frantically.

"Right here". She said, handing me her knife.

I rushed towards the spider, only to narrowly avoid more sickly yellow webs. I couldn't get close because of the many legs and webs and the spider kept getting closer and closer...

I realized there was only one thing I could do to save us.

I cut a cord that was still connected to the fire escape and suddenly, we were thrust to the ground.

To my horror, the spider landed on its feet whilst me and Emily took significant bruises with our fall to the sidewalk we were hanging from.

I quickly got up, stumbling a little bit but holding Emily's Knife.

I turned to see Emily Making sure Cody was ok. If I lose...We will all die.

I rushed towards the spider, being wary of the webs and the legs, I weaved between the spider and managed to stab it in the side of its face before being knocked back by one of its legs.

The spider shrieked and ran towards me but I was ready, I ducked under the spider and stabbed into its underbelly.

It stumbled for a second, then turned back to me to charge but as it took another step, a drop of blood leaked from the cut I inflicted. The spider tried to move but as it took another step, the wound opened up more and suddenly, tons of blood and the spider's insides leaked out onto the floor with a wet splat.

Shortly after, me and Emily, with combined effort, managed to drag Cody and ourselves into a nearby alleyway that seemed safe.

I decided to type this out while I had the chance, I'm exhausted and there's monsters at every twist and turn. Along with Cody being a liability, The wound in my chest is getting worse and worse. It went from barely feeling it to a burning pain in my chest. Me and Emily decided we need to head to the Hospital first and foremost or else we probably wont even make it to St Georges.

I'll leave it at that for now, I'll post again as soon as I can.
