Brett: "This is Brett Halliway from the Neighborhood Homeowners Association. I am here with Thomas Wilker, Elijah Lewis and Candice Hart here at the abandoned [Audio distorted] Elementary School investigating the disappearance of several children in the area."

Candice: "Do you seriously have to record this in an audio log? I'm stressed out enough by this situation as it is."

Brett: "Well, we need to record any information we find somehow."

Tom: "Shut it, you two. Just help me with the front door."

(Grunts of struggle can be heard, before a door is heard creaking open)

Elijah: "Wow. Dark. Totally not ominous or spooky at all."

Tom: "Let's just get this over with."

(Footsteps and doors opening can be heard)

Brett: "Well, there's nothing in this classroom. Let's check the rest before we head to th-"

(A loud crash is heard, and scuttling follows soon after)

Candice: "What the hell was that?! It came from the hallway!"

(Recording stops)
...
(Recording resumes)

Brett: "This is Brett. We followed that noise to the gym on the first floor. Elijah swore he saw something, but couldn't tell what it was. It was probably just a rat or something, but we'll check it out."

Elijah: "Guys, come here. There's a mattress here."

Candice: "Has someone been... living here?"

Brett: "Seems like it. There are empty water bottles here, too. Bed's dirty as hell. Stains all over the mattress and pillow."

(A door can be heard opening on the other side of the gym)

Tom: "Holy hell, is that... Mrs. Lane's son? Hey there, buddy, where have ya been? We've been lookin' for you all over the place. Your mom's worried, so how about you come back with us, okay?"

(Rapid footsteps can be heard retreating, and Candice is heard cussing)

Candice: "What the- hey! Get back here!"

(Recording stops)
...
(Recording resumes)

Brett: "So... we chased his up to the second floor. We lost him, but we're sure he's here."

Elijah: "That was definitely Adam Lane, but how the hell is he still alive? He's been missing for a week."

Candice: "Why did we even agree to do this? This place creeps me out big time."

Elijah: "Because everyone else was too busy shitting their pants to volunteer."

Tom: "You can't really complain. Growing up in [Audio distorted] you tend to see some... strange things."

Candice: "Whatever. I'm from out of town, so I don't really know what they're so afraid of. Hey, over here. I found something."

Brett: "Ew... what is that, slime?"

Tom: "It looks more like... saliva to me."

Elijah: "Gross. Whatever this came from was definitely here recently. We should keep an eye out for dogs or whatever. Don't want to get rabies."

Tom: "Hey, there he is!"

(Footsteps are heard as the group chases Adam Lane)

Elijah: "Hey sto- oh. Oh. Um, guys? We should run."

(Recording stops)
... ...
(Recording resumes)

Brett: "What the hell was that thing?"

Candice: "I don't know, but at least we escaped it for now."

Tom: "The way the bodies were protruding out like that... I can't get that image out of my head."

Brett: "At least we know what happened to the kids. They became... whatever that thing is. Has it been abducting kids to grow?"

Elijah: "Whatever it is, I don't care. We have to get out of here."

(A roar is heard in the distance)

Brett: (Whispering) "I think it's hungry. Oh god, I don't want to die. I still have a whole bucket list of shit I wanna do before I pass 80."

Elijah: "Shut it. We'll get out of here. Let's get to the front door."

(Quiet and fast footsteps are faintly heard and stop abruptly)

Candice: (Whispering) "Oh god... is it... guarding the exit?"

(Candice can be heard sobbing quietly)

Tom: (Whispering) "Don't worry. We can get out through one of the windows. Let's go to the gym. And, Brett, turn that damn thing off."

(Recording stops)
...
(Recording resumes)

Tom: "Help me with this window, would ya?"

(Struggling sounds are heard as the window is forced open. It makes a shrill squeak as it opens)

Elijah: "Damn that was loud. Let's go before that thing comes."

(A door is heard bursting open)

Tom: "All of you, out now! I'll hold it off with this bat."

(Shrieks of pain can be heard from the monster as it gets hit by Tom with the bat)

Tom: "Well, Brett? What are you waiting for? Get out of here!" 

(Heavy breathing from Brett can be heard as he climbs through the window and out to the other side)

Brett: "Tom! Grab on to my hand!"

(Shrieks of anger can be heard. Tom cries out as he falls out the window.)

Tom: "Stupid thing got me good in the leg!"

Brett: "Whatever, just run!"

(Recording stops)
...
(Recording resumes)

Brett: "This is Brett from the Neighborhood Homeowners Association. I still have no idea what we encountered yesterday. We told the association what we saw, and I showed them this audio log. They said they would take care of it, but I don't know what they mean. Tom is alright, just a few cuts on his leg, not too deep. Candice is still refusing to come out of her house, the poor woman. She didn't know what she was getting into when she moved here. Elijah is pretty much fine, and as for me, I like to think I haven't gone insane. Yet. This is Brett Halliway, signing out."
