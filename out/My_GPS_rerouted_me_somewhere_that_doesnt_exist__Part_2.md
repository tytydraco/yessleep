I didn’t think the GPS voice would ever speak again after what happened near that gas station. I don’t even remember opening the app on my phone, yet there the message was clear as day:

“A faster route is available. Would you like to take it?”

Hesitantly I tapped Yes on the screen, not like things could get much worse than they are now. Immediately my phone began vibrating and heating up, before displaying a new route.

“Proceed to the route.”

Looking at the screen my eyes widened and I felt my heart in my chest; it was telling me to turn back towards the direction of the hands. I’m scared but what choice do I have? I think it’s better to at least try the GPS and see where it leads to, the only problem is that horrible mass of hands. I haven't seen it in a while since driving but I’m sure it's still chasing me, that gross bloody pile clawing over itself… It gives me the creeps just thinking about it.

With no other option I could think of however, I turned my car around and followed the directions on my phone screen. After what felt like a few minutes my phone buzzed:

“Turn left.”

I hit the brakes hard at the sudden instruction. Looking around I can’t see where to turn, the road has been straight for the entire time I’ve driven on it and I don’t think my car has what it takes to make it through the plant life here. Not like I would want to anyways, these plants give me a headache just by looking at them.

It was then that I saw the all too familiar shape in front of me, far away enough to not be a threat but enough for me to know I have to act fast. I forced myself to look to my left and it was then that I saw a dirt trail, almost fully covered by the strange plants. 

Driving through the trail, the landscape quickly changes to pitch blackness. With my headlights on I could barely see the road — let alone anything around me.

As much as I’d like to say I was chased by some horrible monster, the truth is I just drove. For hours. Until suddenly yet unceremoniously, I was back where I started. I don’t understand it — a moment ago I was driving in the dark and now I’m back where I started? Where the hell am I?

I tried turning my car back around and see if I could find the dirt road again, there was nothing there anymore. Literally nothing, the complete lack of anything. Do you know what seeing that does to someone? To see the world just… stop? Like your brain can’t even process what it’s not seeing?

I turned back around once more and drove until eventually reaching the gas station. Slowly pulling up to it I could see that it looked better, more real in a way. The windows worked properly now and I could see the inside of the building, shelves lined up with your typical gas station foods. What really caught my eye though was seeing people inside. They seemed to be working, stocking the shelves and talking to each other. I couldn't believe it, there are actual people here!

I parked my car, before quickly getting out and making my way towards the gas station. As I came closer however I kept thinking about the hands that burst out of here last time… why was I in such a rush anyways? This place can’t be safe, and yet I still found myself moving towards the door, my hand grabbing the handle like it had a mind of its own and pulling it.

With the ring of a bell announcing my entrance there was a single deafening crack, as every worker in the building snapped their heads toward me, their eyes wide, jaws twitching — before saying in perfect unison:

“Hello valued customer, how can I help you today?”

…I didn’t even have time to answer before they started walking toward me.
