 

My wife and I settled our creaking bones into bed after the *most tiring* weekend of our lives. We had just brought our newborn son, Jeremiah, home from the hospital. He was a beautiful little ray of sunshine and he filled our home with immense joy. That is, until he started talking. People told us that parenthood might be scary in the beginning, but no one prepared me to be afraid of my *kid.* My life completely unraveled tonight, and now I have nowhere to go but here. 

My wife was an accountant, and I say ‘was’ because whatever she is now, it is not my wife. She was very goal driven and numbers oriented, and worked for some of the biggest banks in the country. Eventually, she opened her own business and began working out of her home office.

I was a ventriloquist. That’s how I made my living, and it’s how I met my wife. She used to think I was so funny, and I could always make her laugh to cheer her up no matter what problem she was going through. After a few years of marriage, however, she grew colder. I guess she became more focused on money and status, because she began pouring all her time and energy into work and away from me. Soon, a ventriloquist husband wasn’t as funny and charming as it used to be, and I found myself feeling inadequate. A sour marriage can ruin the things you love most, and our marriage ruined ventriloquism for me. It was my passion, it was the flame that kept me alive, a flame she gradually put out. Eventually I became so desperate to keep both my dream and my marriage alive that I turned to the occult. I started asking around until I found someone who promised to solve my problem using black magic.

He was tall and bald except for a few wisps of gray hair. I met up with him at the end of a shadowy alleyway in the rough part of the city. I was kinda scared and I wanted to keep a healthy distance but he beckoned me to come closer. Despite his disgusting appearance, something about him drew me in. I guess it was the sense of power that emanated from him. He had dark yellow teeth and grime under his long fingernails that he used to mix ingredients in little glass jars. He asked me my name and what I wanted.

“My name is Henry Green, and… I just want my wife to respect my career again” I said. He nodded, as if he got this answer a lot.

“And what is it that you do?” He asked me.

“I’m a ventriloquist.” He smiled when I said this. It made me uncomfortable.

“Huh, ventriloquist. You know, we’re not that different. We both act through other beings to get what we want.” He mused. I nodded even though I disagreed.

“Mhmm yeah I guess so,” I just wanted to get out of there. He told me that he could help, but that it was dangerous to proceed with ignorance. The dark spirits he worked with loved to fulfill requests in a way that hurt the petitioner more than help. I expected he would say something like that because it’s what those types of people always say in movies, so I didn’t really take his warning seriously. 

To be honest, I didn’t take any of what he said or did very seriously. I didn’t believe it would work, not really. I was just so desperate that it seemed like the only thing left to try. He told me to bring him a lock of my favorite puppet’s hair, which he would cover with a few drops of my blood and burn with incense to appease the spirits. My favorite puppet was definitely Vinny V. He was the star of my act, and I loved him like a friend. Lately, he had been hanging out in my closet with the rest of the puppets. I wanted to go back to working with him so badly. I knew that, if any physical object could represent my pain, it was Vinny. The man in the alley took the hair, cut my hand to get the drops of blood, and burned the mixture as an offering. A wind swept through the alley as the ceremony drew to a close and blew the smoke from the offering away. As soon as it was over, I got the hell out of there. The whole thing gave me the creeps.

At first it didn’t seem like anything had changed. My wife started working from home, but she was as cold and indifferent as ever. Even though we spent most days together, she acted like we were strangers in our own home. We had such little sex that she even stopped taking birth control, which I guess ended up being what turned our marriage around because not long after, she got pregnant. 

The baby brought us closer together in ways I couldn’t have imagined. My wife said she wanted us to be happy again for the sake of our child, and she started asking me to perform bits for her. It was great; me and Vinny V. were back at it and we could make her laugh harder than she ever did before. Writing new jokes was so easy, it almost felt like magic. Soon, the three of us were closer than ever and I was the happiest I had been in a long time. 

Then, the baby was born. I was foolish enough to think that the baby would bring us even more joy, and even closer together. All of that changed when I heard those first words.

I was awake to take care of the baby, giving my wife some much needed rest, when I heard a man’s voice.

“You make me look like I’m stupid. Oh yeah, like you’d need any help with that!” I startled in my bed. A man was in my house. It sounded like he was in the far corner of the room, and …*was he having a conversation with himself?*

“Hello?” I squeaked.

“Have you been drinking tonight? No. Then why are you talking to a puppet?” He said, followed by a cartoonish “Why I outta!” Whoever was in my room, I assumed he was insane. My first instinct was to crawl back under the covers and pretend this was all a dream, but then I looked at my wife lying peacefully by my side, and the baby in his crib next to her. I was a husband and a father, with duties to fulfill and a family to protect. My love for them gave me new courage.

“I don’t know who you are,” I said in the deepest, manliest voice I could muster, “but I’ve got a gun and you better leave before I use it. Now scram…punk!” I yelled. I admittedly sounded more like a grumpy old man in a children’s movie from the ‘80s than a serious threat, but that was the best I could do. My years of ventriloquism had trained my stage voice to be goofy and family friendly, something that I deeply regretted in that moment. Then the baby started crying, and my wife stirred.

“What’s going on,” she mumbled. “Why are you shouting?”

“There’s someone in the house,” I whispered. That woke her right up.

“What? Where?” she gasped. 

“I’m not sure, but he’s somewhere in this room. I heard him talking to himself. Weird, jokey stuff, almost like he was doing a bit.” At hearing this last part, my wife’s face turned from instinctual fear to abject horror.

“What?” I asked her, alarmed by her sudden change in appearance. “Do you know who it could be?” She shook her head, but her eyes said otherwise. Gently she reached into the crib and pulled the crying baby into her breast to comfort him.

“Look, if someone was in this room we would know it, babe. There’s nowhere to hide.” She was right, there was no way a grown man could be hiding in our room. There wasn’t enough space for it. In fact, the only spot we couldn’t see from the bed was directly under it, but that space was full of heavy storage bins. 

“I’m sure I heard someone though,” I insisted. That’s when the baby, who had calmed down, began to move his lips and the sounds that came out were so shocking that I almost couldn’t believe my ears. I stared in horror as an adult male voice came from my baby’s mouth

“My wife told me to stop imitating a flamingo, so I had to put my foot down!” I was terrified by what I heard, and assumed there had to be some disconnect between the sounds and what I saw. I thought maybe I was hallucinating until I looked at my wife for confirmation that our son really had just spoken like a man. She turned away from my gaze and I noticed her face was red. 

“Babe, what’s wrong?” I asked. She opened her mouth to answer but stammered and stuttered without forming any cohesive thought.

“Well, it’s, it’s, I…there was a time… I didn’t know when, if… sometimes, there were, I was…” she went on like this.

“Did you do something to our baby?” I asked her, leaning my head forward in shock. Her face already told me that she had done something she wasn’t proud of. 

“It wasn’t something I did to the *baby,*” she mumbled. That’s when a rustling noise came from inside the closet. “Oh, God.” She put a hand against her face and looked down in shame. “I didn’t think anything like this would ever happen, I didn’t even think it was *possible*.” I looked from the closet, where the noises were growing louder, to her, then back at the closet, then at her again. “I swear I never wanted you to find out like this,” she squeaked. I wanted to ask her what the hell she was talking about, but didn’t get the chance before the closet door opened and out walked Vinny V.

“What the-” I jumped back and fell on my tailbone.

“Hello, Henry. It’s been a while,” Vinny spoke in the same comical voice I gave him in my act, but he wasn’t being funny. His words were thick with spite and jealousy. “You left me in that box a long time, pal.” He said and took a quick step forward. I scrambled backwards on my hands, kicking at the floor to get away from him. For some reason I couldn’t find the courage to get onto my feet. “I kept waiting for you to come get me,” he took another big step forward, “and waiting and waiting. I said ‘Don’t worry, Henry will be back. He won’t forget about me…not forever.’” He stuck a hand down his pants and pulled out our longest butcher knife, which had gone missing a few days ago. He brandished the knife thoughtfully, touching the blade with his puppet fingers, testing the sharpness of the edge. “Do you know what this is?” He stared hungrily at the knife, then spun around and shoved it into his wooden back.The next thing he said was in a goofy cadence, like it was a joke from our act. “This is the knife you stuck in my back, Henry. Why’d you do that, Henry?” 

“Vinny, you’ve got it all wrong.” I tried to explain things, how I really missed him and had been trying to find a way to bring him back. 

“Shut up!” He ripped the knife out of his back and swung it forward, menacingly. “We used to have such good times, just the three of us.” *Three of us? Did he mean my wife?* “You abused me, you stole my voice, my jokes, and the girl I loved, but I let it slide because you always made me feel *special*,” he stabbed the air, “feel *important*, the star of the show. But then you got sick of me, you let me get worn out, you used me and stole from me until I had nothing left to give, and then you shoved me away in the back of a closet.” 

“Vinny, please!” My wife cried. Something about the way she said it was…off. It was as though Vinny V. was her husband and not me. I looked at her, dumbstruck.

“What the hell is going on?” I asked her. “I mean, what the *hell* is going on?!” She shook her head.

“I don’t know how it happened. I just started…longing for him. When you were out of the house, I would grab him from his box and…spend time with him.” She spoke and her words were frantic, like she was confessing to murder. “It started off as just light conversation, but eventually we got…” she trailed off, and Vinny finished her thought for her. It was horrifying and disgusting just to think about it.

“She discovered the truth, that I was a better lover than you *EVER* were!” He pointed at me accusatorily with the blade. I looked at her to confirm this statement, hoping she would tell me this was all just some terrible fever dream. Instead she looked away in shame.

“I’m so sorry, Henry. I really don’t know how it happened. I just…I couldn’t stop myself! I even started working from home just so I could be with him.” She hid her face in her hands and sobbed. “I never wanted any of this to happen. And I never in a million years imagined that the baby was *his,* I swear!” My jaw dropped when she said this. It wasn’t possible, the baby that I had helped her deliver, whose kicks I had felt in her stomach, who I had dreamt about for nine months, wasn’t mine. It was Vinny V.’s. At first I didn’t accept it, but as I stared at the child I began to see the similarities. Suddenly his talking made sense. He was half puppet. The room spun around me as I fell into a psychological well of despair and confusion. Vinny saw by my expression that the truth had finally dawned on me.

“That’s right, pal. That is *my* baby, and as far as I’m concerned, *my* wife, too.” He came closer, and I scrambled back.

“Vinny,” my wife protested. 

“Stay out of this,” he snapped and she, reluctantly, closed her mouth. The worst part about all of this was the way they interacted. The way they spoke, it was like…like they were a couple. 

“No no no no,” I mumbled and shook my head. It was too much to take in.

“Now, I’m going to take back everything you stole. I’m going to do to you,” he stepped forward, and there was no more room for me to scamper backward. He had me up against a wall. “what you did to me, starting with A KNIFE IN THE BACK!” He pounced forward, slashing with the knife, and I rolled to the side. The fight had begun. I was terrified and also terribly confused, but I wasn’t about to lose my life to a motherfucking puppet.

I hopped onto my feet and dove into him, knocking him down. I got him between my knees and squoze his neck. I tightened my grip with all my might, but it didn’t seem to have any effect on him. *How do you kill a puppet?* I thought. Suddenly he wriggled one arm free and used it to stab me in the stomach. He was surprisingly strong and fast, and the knife went deep into my belly. I let go of him and stumbled back.

“Now you’re finding out-” He started to say something, but before he could finish I kicked him in the head. Vinny was as strong as a man, but he was still as light as a puppet and my kick sent him flying across the room where he collided with the wall and cracked his head. He got up slowly, steadying himself. On the other side of the room, I pressed down on the knife wound in my stomach to try and stop some of the blood which was spilling out of me at an alarming rate. My wife was screaming and wailing, caught between two men she loved. Or rather, one man and one animated puppet.

I walked over to Vinny while he was still regaining his balance and kneed him in the chest. I heard the wood in his abdomen splinter. He wheezed. I tried to grab the knife from him, but he anticipated my arm’s movement like a mind reader. Before I could snatch it away he slid it into my diaphragm. I staggered back and gasped for air. No matter how much I tried, I couldn’t get air into my lungs. Eventually I was able to force some shallow breaths, but by then Vinny was back on his feet and standing over me with knife in hand. I gave it one last shot and tried to kick him in the leg, but he easily dodged it and cut me between my calf muscle and bone. I knew I was beat. He won. The events that followed are like a blurry dream in my memory.

First, Vinny tied up my hands and feet. I tried to resist, but I had lost so much blood and was getting such little oxygen that he could slap my arms away with one hand. After, he treated and sewed up my wounds with surprising precision, but I guess he probably had a lot of practice with thread and needle. At first I thought he was trying to make peace, but his intention soon became jarringly clear. Out from the closet he took a big box. It looked like the one I used to keep Vinny in, except big enough to fit a person; me. He gagged my mouth and shoved me into the box. Everything went dark when he shut the lid, and I heard the *click* of latches being closed. I wriggled as hard as I could, but there was nothing I could do. I was stuck inside the box, the same way I had stuck him away in a box all those times.

Eventually, I was able to get my hands free from the rope and pull out my phone. I thought about calling emergency services, but decided there was no point. The three things I cared about, my wife, the baby, and Vinny, were all gone. After what happened, even if I did get out, there was no way I could get them back. A life without them wasn’t a life worth living, so I decided to just accept my fate. I know that there aren’t many places where people will believe my story, so I chose to tell it here.

Now all I can do is sit here in this box and wait to die. I might have to die of thirst, fortunately there’s a good chance my wounds kill me first, even despite Vinny’s expert stitches. I can hear Vinny and my wife making love in our bed right now. It’s torture to listen to. He was right, I never should have left him in that box. I wish I had ignored my wife’s judgment and kept doing what I loved. Ironically, that might have brought us closer together.

I would give anything to go back to the day before I met that stupid man in the alley and told him about my stupid wish. I could have solved things another way, some other way. It didn’t seem possible at the time, but now that I’m stuck here I’ve realized just how many other choices I could have made. But that’s all over and done now, so there’s no use thinking about it. Hopefully I won’t be thinking about anything for much longer. Luckily my phone still has some battery left and there are lots of interesting stories here to read. The silver lining is that they really [resonate with me now](https://www.reddit.com/r/mybeautifulnightmares/).
