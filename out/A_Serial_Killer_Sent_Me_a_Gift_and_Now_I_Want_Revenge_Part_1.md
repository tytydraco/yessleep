The package arrived on my doorstep three weeks after my daughter Sidney’s body was found. It was small, hastily wrapped in brown paper and sealed with scotch tape. No return address. I didn’t think much of it. Probably something from a friend, or an item I had ordered weeks ago and forgotten about.

I brought it inside to my wife, Emily, who was nursing some bourbon at the kitchen table. I put it on the table and poured myself a glass and sat down. Emily glanced at it. A long moment went by. Ever since Sidney had been abducted and killed, we’d been having trouble speaking to each other. Finally, Emily said, “open it.”

I took a drink and fumbled with the mess of layered tape. I pulled out my house keys to slit the cardboard. When the first flap popped open, small white packing peanuts fell out. I scooped them aside and reached into the box, feeling something.

It was a drawstring pouch. I showed it to Emily, who gave a nonplussed look. I opened the pouch and looked inside.

It contained only one thing: a small empty vial, the kind a chemist might use to hold solutions. The glass was glazed with condensation; the cap sealed with more clear tape. There was some tiny writing on the side. I took it out of the pouch and read it. When I did, my blood ran cold.

The message read: The Last Breath of Your Daughter, Sidney Green.

Right away, I took the vial and package to the police, who turned them over to forensics. Two days later, they called me back to the station. Nothing to identify the killer, but there was a small amount of Sidney’s DNA. Probably from her saliva, the lead detective, Lieutenant Stacy Brown, told me. Lieutenant Brown was young, no more than thirty. She had small bags under her eyes and her breath smelled like coffee laced with peppermint.

I thought about the vial on the drive home from the station. It was a sick joke, a poetic taunt, the product of an evil mind. I looked over at Emily, sitting beside me, staring out the passenger window.  I thought about doing something, like placing my hand on her thigh, but eventually decided against it.

We held a small vigil at my house after the funeral. Sidney’s old friends were there, her volleyball teammates and teachers, the sea of people who always come out when a budding life is cut short. I catered sandwiches and bought kegs of beer and several bottles of wine. The high school kids started drinking, but I didn’t care. Neither did Detective Brown, who came by to offer her condolences. She sat next to me on a rented white plastic lawn chair and sipped some beer. “Nothing new,” she said. “But we’ll get there.” She studied me for a moment. “I can’t imagine how you feel right now,” she said. “I don’t have any kids. My ex didn’t want them. But if I did, and this happened…”

She trailed off. She put a hand on my arm, got up, and promised to be in touch soon.

The vigil ended around six. As the last of the guests were leaving, the cordless phone in the living room rang. I put down a handful of plates plastic plates and picked it up. “Hello?” I said.

A moment went by. I could hear someone breathing on the other end. “Hello?” I repeated. I was greeted by more silence. I was about to hang up, but then the person on the other end of the line finally spoke.

“Did you get my gift?” the caller said in a garbled voice.

The hairs on my neck prickled. Adrenaline seized me and my breath quickened. I leaned against a sofa, feeling my knees buckle just a bit. “Who is this,” I said. Calmly, the caller replied, “I’m the man who killed your daughter. I just wanted to know if you got my gift.”

It took all of my steel, every ounce of restraint I’d built – first as combat medic in the Marine Corps, then as a civilian EMT – to not lash out. I wanted to threaten this man, to promise that I would kill him if it was the last thing I ever did. But there were other things to consider right now. For instance, this was an active phone line, and I might be able to use this call to locate the killer.

Quickly, I scribbled Call Detective Brown, Killer on phone! on a napkin and handed it to Emily, who was standing by the door. Her eyes went wide. She pulled out her cell phone, went into the next room, and made a call.

“I saw you at the funeral today,” the killer went on. “You looked like a gutted fish. Did you open your gift yet?”

“Why did you kill my daughter?”I asked. “Why did you do this?” The killer paused. “Because I like it,” he replied. “I’m not like those dime store killers who don’t want to kill, who say it’s a compulsion. No. Killing makes me feel good.” He paused again, then said, “Killing your daughter made me feel best of all.”

At that moment, Emily came back into the room and gave me a thumbs-up. The police were on their way. As if he was standing right next to us, the killer immediately said, “I have to go now, Joe. Please don’t forget to open your gift.”

Temper rising, I forgot about my fear. “Fuck you,” I said. “You murdered my daughter. You took away the best thing I ever had. And now you’re insulting me by calling this a gift?”

Another long pause went by.

Then the line went dead.
