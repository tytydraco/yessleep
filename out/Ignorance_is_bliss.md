TW: blood, implied sexual content



I was staying in an old hostel where I had been let a room for a few days. I had gone out and had just returned to find two girls supervising a group of workers moving in an extra bed and other things into the room. I protested at someone having entered the room without my permission. 

The smaller of the two girls lost her temper and began to yell at me, screeching in an annoying high pitched voice saying she was burdened with having to manage people wanting rooms and having run out of them or something of the sort. I was not too happy at having my privacy invaded so I shot back at her with no intention of letting her get away with this behaviour. I told her that I had left my valuables in the room and that she could personally look forward to a legal quagmire if I were to find anything amiss. The other girl who appeared to have kept her composure  intervened, soothing her and told her “anyone would be bothered, especially if they had left something expensive behind believing it to be secure”. She followed this with an apology to me.  

The smaller girl finally shut up and I decided it would be wiser to address the calmer of the two. I apologised at having had to raise my voice and thanked her for understanding my point of view. The smaller one apologised as well and told me that she had been disturbed at what had been going on in the hostel of late which I would not be familiar with as I was new there. Both of them looked quite tired, the smaller one had clearly slept poorly as evidenced by the dark marks under her eyes and her friend looked quite pale and rather ill.  I asked her as to what had happened and she related that there had been some sort of incident in one of the bathrooms last night. She told me that the bathroom had become a den of the most disgusting degeneracy and people did not want to occupy rooms on the same floor and hence the extra bed in my room. 

Her rather melodramatic description piqued my curiosity.  The two of them led me to the bathroom at my request.  The place was absolutely disgusting, I was revolted. The smell was utterly foul and the floor was flooded with a layer of dirty water. In one of the stalls where the door was open, I could see a large dark stain on the floor that looked like it might be dried up blood. It was a rather wide patch and it had the appearance of coffee grounds. It looked like someone had been very sick or very injured. “What happened here!” I exclaimed. One of the girls said that it looked like menstrual blood. I was aghast, there was  far too much blood for this to have been a trivial accident. Realising what I must be thinking, the smaller one said that someone had coupled up in the bathroom last night —the people in the neighbouring rooms had overhead; and whatever they had indulged in had left this ugly stain. For a moment I wondered what sort of ‘coupling’ could have possible led to this most vile parody of a Rorschach test on the bathroom floor but decided I was better off not knowing. 

I closed my eyes against this perverse sight. I had a hangover and it was making me dizzy. Hazy memories played beneath my dark eyelids.  I felt sorry for the mess the two girls were left to deal with. I opened my eyes and looked at the smaller girl and then at the other. The pallor of her skin was striking. She caught my gaze and gave me a shy smile. Shame I never realised she was sick last night.
