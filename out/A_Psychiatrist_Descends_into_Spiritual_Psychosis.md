The following event happened to me exactly two years ago today.

**The Encounter**

I always found the walk back to my office unsettling after rounds, especially today. The narrow corridor, lined with its clinical, off-white walls, seemed to narrow even further with each step, as if constricting around me. My office was no sanctuary; it was a small, windowless box, the air stale and heavy, saturated with the ghosts of a thousand consultations.

As I settled behind my desk, the fluorescent light above flickered, casting uneven shadows that danced across the clutter of medical journals and patient files. I turned on the desktop computer, its screen illuminating the room with a harsh, unnatural glow. A sense of unease settled over me as I realized I had missed something crucial in the new patient's history.

Details are the lifeblood of psychiatry, and missing even a single thread could unravel a patient's story. Resolving to fill in the gaps, I left my office, the door swinging shut with a definitive click that echoed slightly in the empty hallway.

The psychiatric unit was unnaturally silent as I entered. The usual hum of voices and footsteps was absent, replaced by a suffocating quiet that pressed heavily against my ears. My footsteps sounded unnaturally loud as I approached the double doors, the badge reader beeping softly as it granted me access.

Inside, the atmosphere was charged with an eerie stillness. The ward, typically bustling with activity, felt abandoned. A lone figure caught my eye—a man wandering the corridor. He was slight and pale, clad in a hospital gown that hung loosely from his thin frame. His bare feet padded softly against the cold floor, and he muttered to himself, lost in a private world.

"Hey, \[my first name\]... It's Jesus," he said without looking up as I passed.

I stopped dead in my tracks. His use of my first name was jarring—there was no way he should have known it. I was always 'Dr. \[my last name\] here. My mind raced, trying to process what I had just heard. I’d had patients before, in psychotic or manic states, claim to be prophets or religious figures—it wasn’t unusual. But this was different.

The man’s face didn’t resemble any image of Jesus I’d seen before. He looked more like a young Paul McCartney, though even that comparison seemed too human, too simple. His face was gentle and unassuming, yet there was a weight to his presence, a gravity that seemed to pull me in.

We stood there, suspended in time, the world around us fading into the background. There were no alarms and no noise from the nurses’ station—just him and me. Everything slowed, and the ticking clock of the hospital was reduced to a distant hum. A flood of emotions rushed over me—shock, disbelief, awe, and fear, all tangled together. But beneath it all, I felt an inexplicable calm. It was as though this moment had been preordained as if I had been chosen for it.

I swallowed hard.

"I’ve made many mistakes," I responded instinctively, my voice echoing slightly in the empty hallway, "but I’ve tried to be kind."

"You’re saved," he replied quietly, his voice calm and clear, cutting through the still air with an unsettling precision.

A mixture of emotions surged through me—confusion, relief, disbelief. The words 'You're saved' hung between us, heavy with meaning I couldn't fully comprehend.

"Can I hug you?" I asked, my voice cracking with emotion.

He nodded, and as we embraced, I felt a warmth that seemed to seep into my very bones, comforting yet overwhelming. It was an ordinary hug, but under the circumstances, it felt like a lifeline.

"Am I dead?" I half-joked, pulling back to look at him.

"This is living," he answered simply, a small smile playing on his lips.

He continued down the hallway, leaving me standing alone, the echo of his words resonating in the empty air. Suddenly the ward was filled with the usual bustle of nures, patients, and dialogue. The man who said he was Jesus was nowhere in sight.

Shaken, I returned to my office, the encounter weighing heavily on me. I barely managed to sit down before tears began streaming down my face. I hadn't realized how tightly I'd been holding on to a thread of composure until it snapped.

A knock on the door jolted me from my reverie. It was Dr. S, my attending, looking concerned. I wiped my eyes and blurted out some excuse to explain my emotional state. I muttered something about a family illness, a half-truth that explained the tears but not their real cause.

He nodded, understanding yet unknowing, and suggested I take a more extended break. I agreed mechanically, my mind still reeling from the encounter.

Once alone, I left the hospital, driven by an inexplicable urge to flee.

**The Journey**

I stepped outside into the evening air, feeling as though the world itself had shifted. The colors around me seemed more vivid, more saturated, as if someone had turned up the contrast on everything I saw. The sunlight poured over the hospital parking lot in thick, golden rays, bathing the asphalt in an ethereal glow. It was late in the day, but the brightness felt like a crescendo—like the sun itself was offering one final, glorious performance before slipping beneath the horizon.

I walked briskly to my car, my mind racing, heart thudding in my chest. The encounter with the man—or Jesus, or whoever he truly was—had left me both rattled and clear-headed at the same time. I was saved. I kept repeating it to myself as I turned the key in the ignition and felt the soft rumble of the engine beneath me. I had been chosen, pulled into something bigger, something I couldn’t yet fully comprehend. But I knew one thing: I had to move. There was an urgency, a pressing need to keep going.

The road stretched ahead of me like a path that had already been laid out. As I merged onto the highway, a strange calm settled over me. Every car around me was white—gleaming and pristine, like pearls scattered across the black ribbon of the road. Each one bore a religious symbol—a cross, a fish, a verse from the Bible. It didn’t feel like a coincidence. These cars, these vehicles, were part of the journey, part of the plan. I was one of them. We were all heading in the same direction.

On the opposite side of the highway, things were different. The westbound lanes were jammed with cars, their taillights creating a sea of red, like a warning. The cars were moving at a crawl, bumper to bumper, trapped in a gridlock that seemed never-ending. I felt an odd sense of pity for them. They were lost. Misguided. Heading the wrong way. My side of the road, the eastbound side, was nearly empty by comparison, smooth and unbroken. We were the chosen ones, heading toward salvation, while those on the other side were trapped, ensnared by whatever forces controlled their fate.

I tightened my grip on the steering wheel, feeling a surge of energy—anticipation, excitement, a strange exhilaration coursing through me. I was heading east. Toward something. Toward destiny.

The sun, now low in the sky, cast long shadows across the highway, turning the landscape into something surreal, something holy. The trees lining the road seemed to shimmer, their leaves flickering like candles in the wind. Even the clouds took on a radiant quality, their edges outlined in gold as if painted by a divine hand.

As I drove, music filled the car—Swedish House Mafia’s “Heaven Takes You Home.” The song pulsed through the speakers, the rhythm matching the pounding of my heart. I rolled down the windows, letting the cool air rush in as I pressed harder on the gas. The white cars stayed with me, like a convoy of the saved, moving together, yet each on its own solitary path.

The billboards along the highway seemed different too. No longer just advertisements for fast food chains or local businesses, they felt like messages, like signals sent directly to me. "Keep going!" one sign read in bright, bold letters. "You’re on the right path!" proclaimed another. Each one felt like confirmation, a reassuring nudge from the universe—or from God—that I was doing exactly what I needed to do.

As the minutes passed, I began to notice something else. Churches. Glorious, radiant churches, appearing at nearly every exit. Each one was more magnificent than the last, their steeples reaching high into the sky, illuminated from within by a light that was not of this world. They stood like beacons, guiding me forward, reminding me that I was among the saved.

My phone buzzed on the seat beside me, the screen lighting up with a series of missed calls. Dr. S. The hospital. My colleagues. I ignored them. I knew what this was—another test. Satan, or some force, was trying to pull me back, trying to lure me away from where I needed to be. But I wouldn’t fall for it. I was resolute. I was on a mission, and nothing could stop me.

As the sun began to sink below the horizon, the sky shifted from gold to deep orange and purple, like a bruise spreading across the heavens. It was nearly time. I knew something would happen at 7:30 PM—something monumental. The song “19:30” played on repeat in my head as I counted down the minutes. This was it. Judgment day. The rapture. The apocalypse. It was coming, and I was ready.

I took the exit for \[Name Redacted\] Island, a secluded park just off the highway. The entrance was marked by a rusted gate and a small booth where an attendant stood. He looked at me with tired eyes.

"We’re closed," he said flatly, his voice devoid of emotion.

I hesitated, feeling the familiar twinge of doubt creep in. But I wasn’t swayed. This was another test. Another attempt to keep me from where I needed to be.

"I need to get in," I said, my voice firm. "It’s important."

The attendant ignored my second request and continued to read his book. I couldn’t be stopped. I drove through the gate and into the park, the gravel crunching beneath my tires. I checked my rearview mirror but did not see any signs of protest from the attendant.

I drove deeper into the park until I reached a small clearing. I parked the car and stepped out, feeling the cool earth beneath my feet. The air was still, the silence absolute. I looked up at the sky, now a deep, inky black. And then, as the clock struck 7:30, it happened.

The stars began to fall.

One by one, they streaked across the sky like fireworks, leaving trails of light in their wake. They weren’t stars, though—at least, not in the way we normally understand them. They were something else. Something divine. Messengers, perhaps. Angels descending to mark the beginning of the end.

I stood there, breathless, watching as the heavens opened before me. The air around me seemed to hum with energy, vibrating with a frequency I could feel in my bones. I was part of this. I was meant to witness it.

The ground was soft beneath my feet, the air cool but comforting. The hum I’d been hearing—low, vibrating, as if coming from the earth itself—was still there, faint but constant, reminding me of the power behind this moment. The apocalypse wasn’t chaotic. It was unfolding as it was meant to.

But as I wandered deeper into the park, something shifted. The air became heavier. My mouth dry. At first, I ignored it—too focused on the unfolding apocalypse to worry about something as mundane as thirst. But the feeling grew, gnawing at the edges of my awareness. My steps slowed as I realized how parched I had become, how my legs felt heavy, how the world around me began to fade into the deeper shadows of the night.

I hadn’t brought water. I hadn’t even thought about it. My mind, once sharp and clear, began to cloud. I wandered through the park, my footsteps slow, deliberate. The cool air that had once felt refreshing now felt biting, cutting through me as I broke into a sweat.

I needed water. I needed something to ground me.

I wandered through the park, my vision blurring, the world around me spinning. Eventually, I found a parked truck, its door unlocked. Inside, I discovered a half-empty bottle of water, which I drank greedily. But it wasn’t enough. My mind was slipping, unraveling at the edges. I opened a notebook lying on the seat, and what I found inside terrified me. Lists—names, details—people who had been "terminated" by their doppelgangers.

Panic surged through me. The doppelgangers were real. They were hunting people. I was in danger. I needed to escape.

I turned the ignition, but the truck was a manual, and I’d never driven one before. My mind raced as I tried to remember the sequence. Clutch, gas. The truck sputtered to life, and I sped toward the gate, convinced that the gate was a trick, a hologram. I floored it, and the truck crashed into the gate, throwing me into the steering wheel.

Dazed and terrified, I tumbled out of the truck and collapsed onto the grass. Time blurred. I don’t know how long I lay there, curled in a ball, waiting for something—anything—to happen.

And then, I heard voices.

The police had found me. Their flashlights cut through the darkness, their voices distant and muffled. I couldn’t tell if they were real or if they were the doppelgangers come to finish me off.

"Who are you?" one of them asked.

"I’m Jesus," I muttered, barely audible, my mind too fractured to comprehend what I was saying.

Their hands on my shoulders, guiding me toward the ambulance, felt distant, like I was trapped in a fog. My thoughts, once sharp, had begun to spiral, tumbling over themselves as reality slipped through my fingers. By the time they strapped me to the gurney, I had convinced myself I wasn’t in the world anymore.

**The Descent and Ascent**

The back doors of the ambulance closed with a definitive thud, sealing me inside the stark, sterile interior. As we sped towards the hospital, the only sounds were the dull roar of the engine and the occasional crackle of the radio. Each turn and bump on the road jolted me, tightening the grip of fear in my chest.

When we arrived at the emergency room, I was quickly wheeled inside, the bright fluorescent lights overhead blinding me temporarily. The bustling sounds of the ER, the beeping of machines, and the distant conversations of medical staff created a disorienting cacophony. My mind raced as I was pushed through the corridors, the fear escalating with each passing moment.

No drugs were administered, but the environment itself was intoxicating, overwhelming. The sounds around me began to distort, taking on ominous tones. I heard a girl's voice, filled with desperation and terror, screaming for salvation, pleading not to be sent to hell. The raw fear in her cries mirrored my own escalating panic. I was convinced I was in a holding area for hell, surrounded by beings who might look human but were anything but.

Hospital staff moved around me, their faces blurring in my vision, their voices a menacing murmur. I believed they were doppelgängers or demons, entities sent to deceive and capture my soul. They spoke of drawing blood, of needing my signature for various documents, which my terrified mind interpreted as contracts with Satan.

Through my tears and sobs, only one figure seemed benign—a nurse or ER tech whose presence was calming, almost angelic amidst the chaos. He moved with a grace that set him apart from the rest, speaking in soothing tones that, for brief moments, pierced my fear. I clung to the belief that he was a guardian, an angel sent to watch over me in this place of despair.

Finally, a doctor appeared at my bedside. His voice cut through the haze, telling me that I was going to be transferred. My heart sank. I didn’t want to leave. I didn’t want to be taken deeper into this place. But I couldn’t resist. I had no choice. They were going to take me down—straight to the pit.

As they prepared to transfer me again, I was wheeled out of the ER and into another ambulance. The journey that followed was nothing short of surreal.

No sooner had the doors closed behind me than a sensation of descent overwhelmed me. It felt as though my gurney was tipped downward at 45 degrees as if one a roller coaster. I felt wind and my stomach drop as my eyes remained closed. I flew through a circle of flames, the heat of the fire came and went as I zoomed past it. Then I heard a loud bang that reverberated throughout my entire body.

Then, just as suddenly, the descent reversed into a rapid ascent. The g-forces pinned me back as we seemed to shoot upwards, the vehicle transformed into what felt like a rocket hurtling through the sky. I saw nothing but swirling clouds outside, white and impenetrable, the sensation of speed and turbulence unlike anything terrestrial. It felt like an eternity, this flight through the heavens, trapped in a liminal space between realms.

When the tumultuous journey finally ceased, the world outside the ambulance windows settled into the mundane flatness of a highway. But then, something extraordinary happened—a phenomenon I would later relate to the "Miracle of the Sun." The sun itself appeared to dance in the sky, approaching closer than I ever thought possible, its rays reaching out like fingers, giving a surreal thumbs-up that both bewildered and mesmerized me.

Suddenly, the rays of light shot out from the sun and pierced through the ambulance windows, straight into me. I felt them enter my body, burrowing deep into my soul. The sensation was indescribable. It was like pure love, pure warmth, flooding every inch of me. I arched backward involuntarily as the light consumed me. Ecstasy. Euphoria. It was as if I had been filled with the Holy Spirit.

As the ambulance doors opened again, I was wheeled into the psychiatric ward of the hospital. The transition from the perceived celestial voyage to the clinical starkness of the ward was jarring. Here, finally, antipsychotics were administered, the medicine coursing through my veins bringing a gradual cessation to the hallucinations and terror.

**The Aftermath**

It wasn’t until later that I realized the truth. The Adderall I had bought off the street wasn’t Adderall at all. It was meth. That’s what triggered the whole episode. I had been spiraling out of control during residency, taking more and more to keep up with the demands, and when I ran out of my prescription, I turned to the streets. It was a mistake—a mistake that nearly cost me everything.

The realization dawned slowly as I recovered, piecing together the fragments of that harrowing episode.

As a psychiatrist, I have seen countless cases of psychosis. I had heard the stories and listened to the delusions. But this? This was different. Every minute of the day leading up to the encounter had been like any other day. Later during the episode, yes—the fear, the paranoia, the disorganized thinking—they were all part of the psychosis. But that encounter with Jesus? Do people who experience psychosis feel the physical sensation of flying through space for over 30 minutes or see and physical flames that aren’t there? The experience was so immersive it completely obliterated any understanding of what I thought psychosis was.

It was real to me in a way that defied explanation.

This experience, though rooted in delusion and fear, profoundly altered my understanding of spirituality and my own identity. Raised Catholic, I was living as a practicing agnostic, especially after coming out as gay. My life was far from what one might consider pious. The church had not been a sanctuary for me, given its stance on my sexuality, and I attended only for familial peace during holidays. I barely thought about religion at all.

However, the visceral reality of my encounter and journey through what felt like a battle for my soul forced me to reevaluate my beliefs. It wasn't just about religion or doctrine but about a deeper, more personal sense of faith and purpose. Now, removed from clinical practice, I realize the importance of the intersection between spirituality and mental health.

I still attend church, now more engaged in the community and the spiritual connection it offers, seeking genuine experiences and a deeper understanding of the peace I felt in the eye of my storm. My journey through madness to a sort of rebirth has not only changed my professional path but has also brought me closer to a spirituality that accepts and embraces who I am in its entirety.
