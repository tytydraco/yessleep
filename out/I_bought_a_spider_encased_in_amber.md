I’ve been browsing Ebay for fossils since I first started collecting them.  I found this one listing of a spider encased in amber.  It didn’t look like any spider I have seen before.  The seller didn’t know what type of spider it was and since I like a good mystery, I decided to buy it.  



A week later it arrived, and I immediately opened the package. I finally got to see it up close. I didn’t think it was a spider; but some other kind of arachnid. It seemed this was a new species. The “Spider” was a shiny beige, and it had a segmented abdomen with several short cylindrical segments. Its legs extended forward in a crab-like fashion. It had disproportionately huge chelicerae, like scissors. It had long pedipalps with a claw-like structure at the tip, almost like a scorpion’s pincers, but not as big. The pincers looked hollow. There were also eggs in the amber. 



I decided to show it to Mr. Orio Hoffman, one of my professors. It piqued his  interest, and it just so happened he had a friend who studied arachnids. I met Dr. Hoffman in the back of the college science building.  He’d drive me over to Dr. Henry Bolton. Bolton had his own lab out in the middle of nowhere where he studied arachnids. He trusted very few people. Hoffman was one of them. We drove up a long winding dirt driveway. Two huge buildings came into sight next to a small house. 

“Bolton, will be in the back lab building,” Hoffman said. “He spends from sun up to sun down with his arachnids. They’re his family. He’s a different sort of bird, but no one knows more about arachnids.”

“You really think he’ll be able to identify it?” I asked.

“If not him, then I don’t know who.”



We reached the back building and rang the doorbell. I heard a whirring noise, looked up and saw a video camera.  A moment later the door unlocked and swung open. I followed Dr. Hoffman to the back of the building. As I walked, I couldn’t help but be in awe. There were mini-habitats full of every type of arachnid I’d ever seen, plus many I couldn’t identify. A strange little man held a Gooty Sapphire Ornamental Tarantula gazing into its many eyes. I’d never seen one before in person. They are critically endangered and rare. He stood up and put the Gooty back into its enclosure.



“So, what’s this now? You have something to show me?” I nodded. “Hurry up now, boy. I have not the time to dawdle.”

I set my backpack down on the table and fished out the strange arachnid. “I bought this off Ebay. The seller didn’t know what it was. I can’t identify it either.”

Bolton picked up the chunk of amber and studied it. “Hmmm, very curious. Nice egg specimen.” His eyes sparkled. “It’s been years since anyone brought me something I couldn’t identify from my encyclopedic knowledge.” He tapped his head.

“I’d appreciate any help you could give me.”

“I knew this would be right up your alley, Henry,” Dr. Hoffman said. Bolton wandered off before Dr. Hoffman had finished speaking. “It’s best if we just go now. Henry will call me when he knows something.”



The next day I decided to do my own research. I’d taken a photo of the creature earlier so I searched it with Google lens. I didn’t see anything related except for a YouTube thumbnail. I clicked on the video.  It was from YouTube user jarviscooper94, he was showing off his fossil collection. Halfway through the video I saw the very same strange spider. He also didn’t know what it was.  He mentioned that he got it from a rock and gem shop. A YouTube user called SkibidiPaws commented, “about the arachnid fossil, the hollow claws suggest it was modified into hypodermic fangs for injecting venom like a pseudoscorpion or  the toxicognaths of a centipede.” 

Three weeks passed and I still hadn’t heard back from Bolton. My professor was planning on bringing students to Henry’s lab that day for a project so I decided to accompany the class to see what was going on.  When we arrived something seemed off. It was quiet,  too quiet. I didn’t see Bolton anywhere. The lights were left on but it looked like  it had been abandoned for at least a week.  Then I noticed something. The amber was on the floor, cracked open. The arachnid was still there but the eggs were spilled over the floor. I knelt down and examined the floor. Was it possible? The eggs looked like they had hatched. 



I went further in the lab. Bolton lay on the floor with two holes in his leg. I found three more sets of holes, one on his neck, one on his arm and another on his leg. His body was in a state of necrosis. The necrotic wound spread over his leg. I stared at it.  I only snapped out of it after hearing all the screaming and yelling of the class. 

Prehistoric arachnids emerged from under shelves and behind desks. Each one was the size of my hand, and they looked pissed.



The eggs must have hatched after he dropped the amber and it must have been soon after I gave it to him. I heard a hellish shriek. One of the arachnids  jumped on my arm. It bit me but before it could get me with its claws I grabbed a book and sent the little bastard flying. 

These creatures were very fast and chased anything that moved.

The class tried to fight them off. One of the abominations was on one dude’s neck. He screamed and fell into a table, knocking it over. It crashed into two spider enclosures sending them crashing onto the floor. 

My professor climbed on a table and sprayed them with a fire extinguisher. One of the ancient irate arachnida climbed up my boot, but I kicked it off. Another one tried to sting my ankle but my house-arrest bracelet stopped it. Then one extra large arachnid came right for me, I didn't even notice it until it was about to get me. But before it could, it was stopped by the blue tarantula, it was the gooty from before. It must have escaped during the chaos. I was witnessing an all out arachnid fight!

My professor yelled, “Everybody skedaddle! We don't have insurance for this!” 

I ran out of the lab, the others did too.  Some of them still had angry arachnids on them. 

I ran away from the irate arthropods. One chased me. It was just as fast as me, but I lost it. 



At some point emergency services arrived. Apparently, some policemen and paramedics were attacked too. Several students were taken to the hospital. Later, I heard that they had called the exterminators. 

I tried to forget the incident but I saw something recently that made me remember and it's the reason I’m telling you all this. A redditor called u/Juicinthebeetle made a post in the subreddit r/whatsthisbug. And the picture was of one of the eight legged freaks who escaped the amber and hatched. So be careful out there, these abominations are still out there. And they’re mad…
