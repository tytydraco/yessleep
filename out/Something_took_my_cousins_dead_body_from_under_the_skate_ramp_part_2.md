“In case you wake up tomorrow and think this was all a dream.” The tall sharp featured man said with a wink as he stamped my hand. The stamp left behind a black ink pentagram. I almost laughed in his face. As if I was going to have some otherworldly experience at some small goth DJ set held in the function room of Hurstmere Caves

Hurstmere Caves is, as you may have guessed, a series of cave tunnels near me. The local kids go on school trips there all the time and it has a rich history. They used it as a bomb shelter in WW2 and it has a cool stage sort of area where I think Jimi Hendrix played once. Also, apparently, there are all sorts of Celtic things going on down there, strange markings and such. I took my siblings there last summer.

Ryan, my friend who bullied me into helping him set up his youth club, had gone to Hurstmere caves with me. My best friend likes two things, Jesus and goth music. He also loves adventure in all its forms including accompanying me to goth clubs. He’s very open minded about that sort of stuff. But, I could tell it made him deeply uncomfortable to have a pentagram stamped on his hand. He didn’t look down at it, just shoved his hand in his pocket and stared at the gravel beneath us.

“Those girls haven’t been stamped.” He pointed to two girls taking videos of themselves outside the visitor centre. They were dressed in a way that, in the nicest way possible, made it obvious they got the whole outfit from a TikTok shop or Shein. I couldn’t judge, when I was their age I got all my clothes from the charity and Primark, or I stole my mothers. I liked their look though. I’d call it E-girl adjacent.

“Don’t worry about them.” The tall handsome man smiled, running a hand over his long slick black pony tail. His voice was smooth and eloquent. I wish I could speak like that. When I open my mouth the voice of a Victorian street urchin comes out.

“Thank you.” I said, trying to give him my prettiest boyish grin. He smiled back at me as if he thought I was cute. But not in a “I wanna do you” sort of way, it was more a “Aw look at you.” The condescension was annoying but understandable.

Ryan pushed me forward into the caves visitor centre. The little tuck shop, with its old oakwood rustic set up that usually sold magnets and mood rings, had been transformed into a bar for the evening. Serving the drinks was a purple haired woman in her late forties. She looked Ryan and I up and down before giving us a smile.

“First drink free.” She handed us two cans of vodka and coke. Then hands wrapped around the cans had long thick nails that were painted bright red.

“Oh thank you.” I said to her as I pried the cans from her talons. I then turned to Ryan and whispered. “I like it here.”

“Yeah I bet.” He rolled his eyes and cracked his can open. Then he took a sip as he began walking toward the stairs.

“£6.50 each please girls.” I heard the lady with the talons say to the E-girls that had followed us in. I stifled a giggle with my hand and hurried excitedly down the stairs after Ryan.

As we descended into the function room the sound of Joy divisions “Love will tear us apart” filled my ears.

“Aw I love this song.” Enthusiastically I grabbed Ryan and shook him by the shoulders, almost making his glasses fall off his face. He’s a massive fan of Joy Division as well so he gave me a gleeful smile. I pleaded with him to drink up so I could drag him onto the empty dance floor.

Playing the beautiful tunes was a woman entirely clad in a pleather cat suit and her platinum blonde hair in a high tight pony tail. She bopped along to the tune with us, pong tail swishing side to side. Her dramatic dark makeup made her look transcendent, like a beautiful creature rather than just another person. The function room itself had been decorated with a myriad of Halloween style decorations like fake cobwebs, battery powered tea lights and plastic skulls. It managed to look charming and atmospheric without seeming cheap. Best of all, a dozen different light machines painted the walls and ceiling in swirling bright colours and patterns. Whoever had decorated the space was clearly on a budget but had put love and care into it.

I was already having more fun than I’d had in a long time. I hadn’t danced since Logan died. I’d barely listened to music at all. In truth I barely did anything other than go to work. Then I’d go home, watch trash TV with mum, eat dinner and sleep as much as I could.

Logan's death and disappearance rocked our whole town. As I said, it's not the nicest place around, it’s bleak, and has drug and theft problems. But a murdered child at the local park was completely new for us. Having one of those children’s bodies disappear was just too shocking to fathom. We were usually spared the tragic youthful deaths that the inner city suffered from knife and gang crime. Our decaying suburbia, that usually trundled on unnoticed and forgotten, barely even classifying as a London borough, was suddenly on the news and in people’s minds. We all felt like spiders that had suddenly had light shone in their darkened cozy corner. Or maybe that was just me.

Pictures of Logan were plastered on every lamppost and in every window. His visage was cable tied to fences and shared on social media. The whole community rallied around him and it meant a lot to his mum and the rest of us. People really did mean well. But all it meant was that wherever I turned the minute I left the house I was faced with the cousin I’d failed to protect. The guilt ate me from the inside out. At least one of us was eating, because I certainly wasn’t. I didn’t feel like I deserved food.

Everyone tiptoed around me like I was a bomb that would burst at any moment and start screaming or crying. To be fair I did scream and cry for about three days straight after that night at the ramps. But after that I sort of went numb. I’d cry, but silently in bed laying on my side, not bothering anyone. I cried about Maisie a lot, more so than I think people realised.

People didn’t seem to pay Maisie the same amount of attention. But she lived in a different nearby area and, to be fair, I did see them hold a vigil for her in the town's memorial garden. I think I preferred the way she was allowed to peacefully rest. Her grave was placed in a cemetery at the top of the hill where I used to hang out as a tween. She got a lovely spot under a cherry tree where the blossom would fall in the late spring.

I do also think, and perhaps this is a bit jaded, that people liked the mystery of Logan's disappearance and were convinced he was still alive somewhere. Hence why they talked about him constantly but forgot Maisie. There were continuous calls for him to be returned home. There was even a reward. His story was being covered by trashy true crime youtubers before his little body was cold. I reported every video I came across, mostly out of pure malice.

I went looking for Logan all the time. I scoured the fields in case his body had been left somewhere. I went to town centres and just walked around, in case I’d see him with his kidnappers, maybe in disguise. It was impossible to accept that he was dead and gone.

Stupidly, I kept expecting him to come knocking on my door. Or to bump into him in the corner shop. I kept forgetting he was dead. It didn’t help that there are a disproportionate amount of gingers here and a lot of them dress the same as Logan.

It was impossible to live with the guilt and it was unbearable to live with his absence. I missed him so much. I missed him in an indescribably painful way that made my chest hurt pretty much constantly. I’d see adverts for things he’d like all the time and I’d have ideas for school holiday plans where I’d factor him in, then remember he wasn’t coming.

The grief turned me into a grumpy and unpleasant agoraphobe. But my siblings refused to let me push them away. My sister Samantha, who’s a year younger than Logan, was particularly stubborn about me pulling myself out of my depression. She saw right through my self pity and didn’t tiptoe around me like everyone else.

“Ryan’s asking for you Chris.” She said one day from the hallway. Her tone was snarky and unbothered, as if my depression meant nothing to her.

“Tell him I’m not well.” I instructed her, pulling the blanket over myself.

“Liar! You’re sitting on your bum watching Family Guy in the middle of the day.” She called back at me. I heard Ryan giggle from the doorway. “Come in Ryan!” She yelled. I watched Ryan awkwardly shuffled into the front room behind my scary little sister.

Hurriedly, I shoved the bright pink unicorn blanket which I had wrapped around me to the floor and sat up straight.

“Hey.” I tried to greet him like I usually would. My voice faltered a bit but neither of us acknowledged it.

“Hey man.” He said gently, approaching me slowly.

“I’m not a horse. Come and sit down.” I laughed, patting the seat next to me.

Samantha, who had been standing there watching us with her arms folded, nodded her little blonde head at the two of us and marched off to go do whatever tween girls do. I suspect it’s things like summoning demons? Reading Harry Potter fanfiction? Crochet? Hacking?

Regardless, she had left the room and now Ryan and I were alone. I looked over at him and gave him a weak smile. He returned it and then we sat in awkward silence for a moment. I was doing it on purpose to be a dick. I wanted to see what Ryan would do if I didn’t start a conversation. Apparently, he would just sit in total silence. Which I found hilarious.

“I saw this.” He turned on his phone and then showed it to me. “They’re doing a goth night at Hurstmere caves. It’s almost too good to be true right?” He grinned. “Rave. In a cave.”

“Nice.” I said, loving the idea. Then the enthusiasm was sucked out of me. “Don’t you think it’s wrong if I go out dancing when-”

“Chris. It’s been two months. I think everyone's desperately hoping you start going out again….But it’s also okay if you’re not ready. They do it every month and we can go next time. But I was also wondering, do you wanna come help out at the youth club tonight?”

“I don’t know.” I said, looking away.

Ryan took off his glasses, polished them then put them back on. “I know it’s going to be strange because Maisie was there. And listen, I know you don’t necessarily believe in this sort of thing. But that heavy feeling of her presence being around, as a ghost or however you want to view it, isn't a bad thing and you don’t need to hide from it. You don’t need to hide from her. If she happens to be there that’s fine.”

“I just feel so guilty.”

“That’s normal. But if you sit and stew in your guilt you’ll go crazy. Come atone for your sins in my church….come make friendship bracelets with me…as penance.” He smiled.

So, I went to make friendship bracelets at Church. I did feel Maisie's presence and mourned her absence with her peers. It was emotional. I got teary eyed talking to her close friends and learning more about her. We swapped memories of her and there was even some laughter. It was nice. Healing.

I also agreed to go to Hurstmere caves and dance with some old people dressed in unforgiving PVC, per Ryan's request.

As I danced with my floppy haired friend, watching the lights dance around with us, I hit what I like to call the dancers euphoria. I imagine it’s just an aerobic rush. But when I’m dancing, and I’m really into it, I go somewhere else. It’s like I’m actually in the music and part of the beat. My style of dancing is very…swishy. It’s lots of hips and hands and twirling. Works great in goth clubs and nowhere else. I forgot how much I loved to dance.

As Ryan and I were the only people on the dance floor, we had plenty of room to do silly moves. Ryan’s style of dance is a bit more just, jumping up and down and swaying side to side. But he gets really into it and I like watching him absolutely throw down to his favourite songs.

The nice thing about the goth community, generally speaking, is that dancing in weird uncool ways is sort of the point. If you can’t dance, you can dance in a goth club. Ryan never dances anywhere else. And he goes to all of the church parties. But at the goth club he’s on the floor with me all night.

My eyes were closed and I was really feeling the moody baseline of a song I didn’t know when I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned, opened my eyes and saw a sweet young face in front of me with too much blush and winged eyeliner. It was one of the E Girls. I gave her a bright smile.

“Hi!” I said. I very rarely make friends at goth events despite always being sociable and I’m over eager to do so when the opportunity arises.

“Hey! You dance really well!” She praised, party lights dancing on her face. Her friend, in a black striped oversized jumper dress, was partially hiding behind her. Their dynamic was sweet.

“Thanks! I love your outfit!” Which was true. She had a pink tartan skirt and matching pink hair that I thought was awesome.

The four of us made the most of the empty dance floor and took turns copying each other's moves. The DJ played some more modern tunes that the girls recognised. Their naivety was so endearing. They said “Wow this is amazing.” and “What is this song?” Every time an 80’s goth banger played in between the pop punk being played for them. It made me think of when I was about their age and younger, when I first started listening to the music after mostly being into pop punk as a tween too. How transcendent Siouxsie and the Banshees or The Cure are the first time you listen to them. When you’re laying on your bed staring up at the ceiling or dancing in your room in your first “goth” outfit and you fucking ascend to a style of music that clicks with you in a way no other genre has before.

Soon the cool people, who don’t show up as soon as a rave starts, began arriving. Elder goths with late 20th century money and band t-shirts from real live performances joined us on the floor. It was clear they weren’t happy with the young girls dancing with me and Ryan. They gave them funny looks behind their backs and whispered rude remarks to each other.

After dancing non stop for a good while, Ryan and I decided we wanted a break outside. We left the girls to the dance floor and climbed up the steps out of the fire exit and out into the cool evening air of the car park. It was largely empty other than a couple of fellow goths, standing around smoking and chatting.

I felt Ryan tug on my shirt sleeve and pull me into a quiet corner.

“I’ve realised something.” He whispered to me.

“What?”

He showed me the back of his hand. “My stamp. It’s different from yours.” On his hand, in black ink, was a cat.

“Cool. I don’t think it means anything. I suspect they just bought a pack of cheap Poundland stamps. You got the cat one.” I said. Ryan looked uncomfortable but nodded. “Do you wanna leave mate? I honestly don’t mind.”

I did mind. But I wasn’t going to force Ryan to stay if he really felt like something was off.

“They didn’t even give me a bloody stamp.” A girl about Logan’s age, in a Deftones T shirt and black jeans. She was sitting on the short wall outside smoking a cigarette.

“Aren't you too young to be here?” I asked. “And far too young to be smoking.”

“Are you friends with the girls in there?” Ryan asked.

She scoffed and rolled her eyes. “What those fucking posers? No way.” She flicked her cigarette to the floor.

Ryan and I smiled at each other. “Uh huh.” I said. “Do you want my stamp?” I offered.

“Sure.”

I poured a bit of my drink on the mark, then pressed it against the back of the girl's hand.

“Thanks.” She beamed at me, her sloppily black lined eyes looking up at me.

“Also the word poser is cringe.” I said.

“Cringe is such a Gen Z word.” She laughed at me then hopped off the wall and went inside.

“I remember when you were that pretentious and annoying.” Ryan smiled.

“Excuse me?”

“You heard me.”

“Uh huh…So did you want to leave?”

“I kind of want to stick around and make sure those girls are alright.”

“Yeah there’s a suspicious amount of young people here. I wonder if they advertised it on social media too much. Maybe they’re just looking for new blood. The goth scene is dead as fuck.”

“It’s more the girls getting home that concerns me. Considering-”

“Yeah. I was thinking that.” I interrupted him.

“Lets go back inside. I was having fun.” Ryan put his hand on my shoulder and began guiding back inside.

“Can we get another drink? I’m not drunk enough.”

“I was thinking the same thing.”

We went to the bar and paid for a round that time. I bought two drinks and gunned them before getting another to take with me. I was getting annoyed at how long it was taking me to get drunk from 5% alcopops.

“Have you got anything stronger?” I asked the woman behind the counter. I thought I saw her eyes flash for a second as she smirked at me.

“No sweetie.” She shook her head then she said. “Well actually, my boss might be able to find something for you.”

“No. Don’t worry the booze is catching up with me now.” I lied.

I ushered Ryan away from the bar and the creepy woman behind it. As we walked back over to the top of the stairs I saw Ryan’s head turn. I hoped he’d seen a beautiful woman, but no, it was a plaque with some historical information on it.

“You absolute geek.” I laughed at him.

“Shut up. I’m having a look.” He turned to me with a cheeky smile that reminded me of Logan. It made my chest hurt. “Do you reckon we can sneak into the caves? I’ve never actually been in them.”

“What?! Yeah, lets see if we can.”

We followed the directions trying to look as nonchalant as possible. It was ridiculously easy to find them. All that blocked off the cave entrance was a red rope. We stepped over it and stared at the cave’s opening.

“Crazy that this is just under Hurstmere.” Ryan shook his head.

“Come on. I’ll show you around.” I walked backwards into the mouth of the caves beckoning him.

Hurstmere caves is set up like a museum, as I mentioned, so I talked Ryan through the exhibits making up complete bullshit because I failed history GCSE. In truth I was talking to fill the eerie silence. The caves made me uncomfortable and I got the impression I was being watched. Whenever Ryan and I began to walk, I would hear footsteps, but then I’d look behind me and not see anyone. But I assumed it was my mind playing tricks on me.

“And over here is where the Celts used to have their orgies.” I pointed to an alcove with rune like symbols carved into it.

“That’s actually quite offensive to Celtic people.”

“Celtic people don’t exist anymore you dickhead.”

His jaw actually dropped. “...I’m- I’m gonna punch you in a minute.”

“What? Why?” I laughed.

“The entire nations of Scotland, Ireland and Wales and as well the areas of Cornwall and the Isle of Mann would beg to differ that celts don’t exist anymore. Melon”

“I wanna go to the island of men.” I licked my lips.

“Lord give me strength.” Ryan clutched the rosary at his chest.

“Fine. I’ll try again. Over here is where the celts, who apparently love men so much they have a whole island of them, used to have their gay orgies.”

Ryan sighed and opened his mouth to correct me.

Suddenly a desperate high pitched scream echoed through the cave. It rumbled up my spine and made me go cold. My body came out in goosebumps and the silence after the scream was horrifically foreboding. Ryan, without any hesitation, darted off towards the sound of the scream. I followed after him.

There was only one path to run down. The passage that led to the stage. In a few seconds we were in the caves carved-out auditorium.

In plain obvious view in the middle of the stage was the man who had stamped my hand. Next to him was a beautiful woman in a floor length red dress. They had the two E-Girls, whose names I never learned, in their arms. Their long canine-like teeth were embedded in their necks. Their series of cheap plastic but beloved chokers had been ripped off and strewn onto the floor.

Ryan cupped his mouth in disbelief and took a step back. I stood entirely frozen, helplessly watching the scene. The monster's bodies heaved as they sucked the life force out of the girls. I watched the girls' bodies rapidly go from vibrant and young to pale and sucked dry. I wanted them to thrash around, to resist. But they stayed lifeless and placid in the arms of the well dressed man and his red velvet clad lady friend.

The man ripped his teeth from the neck of the girl in the pink skirt. His mouth was dripping with blood, which began falling onto his expensive looking suit. The smell hit me, rich and iron-like. His eyes flashed down at my hand then back up at my face. His bloody mouth turned into a sickening grin, bright white teeth illuminated by the stage lights. His visage was a twisted imitation of a human face. It was impossible to tell whether the smile was meant to intimidate me or try and convince me he was friendly.

Suddenly, the lights went out. I screamed. Any moment I knew I’d feel two teeth pierce my neck and then I’d die. In my last moments I thought of my family.

Then the light of a phone torch suddenly appeared in the darkness. The face of the girl in the Deftones T-shirt appeared behind the torch. She grabbed my hand, scolding me for not moving and began dragging me out of the cave.

I didn’t look behind me as we ran, in case the sight of the creature chasing us with its maniacal grin slowed me down. The thought of its big pointed teeth piercing into my neck made me feel sick with fear. I hated pain. Hence why I had no tattoos, when I’m exactly the kind of person to be covered in them.

I marvelled at the girl's bravery. She managed to get me out of the caves in my frozen state of cowardly panic. We sprinted through the visitor centre, past the makeshift bar and out of the building, onto the street. We didn’t stop running until we reached the bus stop at the end of the road.

Heart pounding, I collapsed against the bus stop and sank to the floor. My whole body came out in tremors. I turned to my side and vomited up the booze I had drunk and the dinner I had before I left. Tears started to stream from my eyes. To any onlooker I must have seemed like a drunken wreck.

The girl handed me a mint and patted me on the shoulder.

“Where’s Ryan?” I asked her. She looked confused before she looked around for him.

“Oh shit.” She gasped, wringing her hands together nervously. “I-I’ll go back and get him.”

I dragged myself up from off the floor. “No way. I’ll go find him. You get the first bus that comes and get out of here.”

“No. I’m coming with you. You have the survival instincts of a fart.”

I rolled my eyes and tried to ignore as she followed me. I ran back to the caves and the visitor centre. As I got closer no music floated in the air towards us. The car park was completely silent. The doors were locked up and the lights were turned off. We’d only been gone for a few minutes.

I banged on the doors.

“What are you doing?!” The girl grabbed my arm to stop me. “Literally swinging a bat at a hornets nest. They’re gone and they’ve taken your friend with them. But I don't think they would’ve killed him so calm down!”

“Huh?” I said, sobbing pathetically. I felt a huge gangly idiot in the presence of this girl that had the problem solving skills and calmness of an aged SAS officer.

“Come on, we need to leave.” She told me. I opened my mouth to speak. “We’ll come back for him.” She promised, patting me on the arm.

I shook my head. “I’m calling the police.”

“And what are they gonna do?”

“Go after the killers.”

“You think you can stop a gang of vampires with the underfunded MET police force?”

“We should tell them.”

“Mhm.”

I ignored the pretentious tweenage girl and called the police. I told them everything and I could tell they thought I was crazy. But still, they could tell I was in distress and they showed up eventually. The two of us waited and watched in the car park while the officers searched the caves. As an officer opened up the fire exit door, I caught a glimpse of the function room. All the Halloween décor had disappeared. It was as if the party never happened.

A police officer came and sat on the curb next to me. “Listen son. I heard about what happened with your cousin and I know grief’s a funny thing, but you cannot waste police time. I’ll let you off this time, but if this happens again I’ll at least have to give you a warning.”

I ignored the smug look on the girl’s face and nodded to the police officer.

“Well then.” She said as we watched the police car drive off.

“You need to go home.” I told her, using my best older sibling authoritative tone that never works. I started walking in the direction of the bus stop.

“Didn’t realise you were Logan's older cousin y’know.” She remarked as she followed me.

“You went to school with him?” I asked.

“Yeah he used to bully me.” She said matter-of-factly, as if that wasn’t harrowing information.

“Huh?” Logan didn’t seem like the type of kid to bully anyone.

“Well his friends do. He sort of used to just…watch and occasionally throw a bit of paper at me or something.”

“Did you know Maisie?”

“Oh yeah. She was my best friend.” The girl said, lighting another cigarette. “Before your little arsehole cousin came [along.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mqvyjt/something_took_my_cousins_dead_body_from_under/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
