Yellowstone National Park, I would argue, is the most well known Park in the world. From its beautiful forests, diversity of wildlife, and of course, the geysers that spray boiling water, such as the Morning Glory pool. Like a giant rainbow gemstone after being cut open, the mutli-coloured pool was red, green yellow and had many attractive shades of blue.

Something you would pay a heavy some to see.

And then there is the Volcano. A gargantuan, underground supervolcano that is active and world-ending if it were to erupt. But you actually don't need to worry yourself about such a thing, we are safe from that. By the time it does explode, humanity will probably be living on other planets and we may watch the devastation from afar. Hopefully.

But nonetheless, the park is a beautiful part of our world and I'm sure it is a ‘place to be’ to be on the bucket list of most of the American population.

Thousands of people all year around come down to visit with their family, friends or by themselves. People from different states, countries and continents, all excited faces coming in and leaving visibly satisfied. 

I was happy watching them come and leave. But now I worry for their safety.

Let's bring this back to the beginning. To protect my own identity and the identity of others in this story, I'm gonna call myself….Michael for now and the two others involved in this Sarah and Bob. A bit standard, but alas.

We both worked at the park for a few years now, with me and Bob as rangers and with Sarah, who actually worked at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. I got around fine with Bob and Sarah is my sister in-law. She actually introduced me to this job opening not long after she married my sister. I was very grateful for that and now I hope she'll have my back when I tell the family about what happened.

It all started about a week and a half ago, with some campers leaving the woods and giving Bob and I odd reports. They said that the overall trip was pleasant, but they were disturbed by some noises they heard. They described it as a “deep rumbling noise” that they felt just as much as they heard. Bob and I had no clue what that meant and chalked it up to their imagination, but soon we heard it as well. A distant and faint, but still very much existing noise.

A low rumbling that felt powerful. And some campers after that reported seeing trees in the distant shaking and moving like they were being pushed. I theorized for a bit that it was a stampeding bison herd, but the frequency of the rumblings didn't match that of a group of running animals, and I heard what a stampede sounded like and it didn't match.

I had a strong feeling of what it was. Or more specifically, the source was on the tip of my tongue. It's like when you take a test at school and there's a question that you knew the answer to, but you just couldn't right it down.

As it went on, Bob jokingly said “Maybe it's the Volcano.” and I laughed with him. But that part of my brain latched onto that and I began to worry that it was the Volcano. Tremors and rumblings that would have been picked up by various equipment like rector scales occasionally happen, but not to the extent we would all hear it and shake trees. Not to my own memory at least and I was worried the Volcano was acting up.

I tried to rationalize it as the Rumblings being something else. If it was a volcano, more trees would shake and not small sections of them, as the campers described, and if the Volcano was acting up, Sarah would have called to inform us. Or anyone else from the observatory in case it was something we would be concerned about or just to calm our nerves on a seismic behavior we had no knowledge of. But that part of my brain wouldn't relax and I feared the worst.

So I took it upon myself to call Sarah and ask. I sighed in relief and felt my heart beat normally as Sarah told me there hadn't been any seismic activity or tremors. In fact, things have actually been relatively calm. Though I was glad to know we weren't under threat of an eruption, that did mean their source of the noise remained a mystery.


After another day of our usual work routine of patrolling the park without going deep into the wilderness, only to be interrupted by a low and deep rumble that came from a good distance away, I decided that I was going to get to the bottom of this. Last thing the park needed was something bothering the visitors.

After consulting with Bob on the matter, I packed some essentials and decided to use a bike that was made for cycling through forest terrain and made my way deeper in the wilderness. After taking solace that the volcano wasn't behind this, I wasn’t nervous as I went into the wooded areas of the park, and I certainly wasn't afraid of the animals. Deer and coyotes avoid humans, bison are only dangerous when provoked and wolves also know that humans are not meant to be interacted with. We had a bit of a mutual understanding with them.

I thought about what the noise could have been. Maybe machinery cutting down trees illegally or dumb kids partying too hard away from everyone else. After a while, I passed through the empty camping area and stopped to catch my breath. As I did, something loud made me jump.

Rumbling again, but not the same. It was far away and lasted longer and continued still and soon I could see a wave of brown coming through from the trees. It was maybe 100 or so meters away and I felt my body begin to prepare to flee as the stampeding bison thundered across a small clearing. All grouped tightly together to protect the young, they stomped and ran down past before turning sharply to their left and went into another section of the forest.

I sighed knowing they weren’t heading towards any tourist centres and I waited for the wolf pack to come into view. But they didn’t come. There weren't any wolves anywhere, or anything else that would have caused the bison herd to run. And I knew that they were just migrating or moving from one place to another, that was clearly a panicked behavior. They were being chased, but there was not a wolf in sight. Nor was there a bear that decided to make its appearance in the park.

It made me think of the other theories behind the other strange recent events. I thought it really was people steering trouble and scaring the wildlife. I pulled out my walkie talkie at that moment and spoke into it.

“Hey, Bob? I just saw a herd of bison stampede near one of the camping sites, clearly panicked behaviour. Over.”

A moment passed and Bob's voice came through “Roger that. Were there any wolves or anything chasing them? Over.”

“Nothing from what I saw. I think there is someone or a group of people disturbing the wildlife. I'm going to check it out. Over.” 

There was another pause “Alright, but be careful. If it seems too dangerous, come back and we can regroup and decide what to do there. Some visitors could get hurt if this keeps up, last we need is someone being run over by a one ton cattle. Over”

“Roger that.” I replied before putting my walkie talkie away and cycled on, following the direction the bison came, making sure I was going slow and steady.

As I travelled deeper, it felt like I was suddenly moving through molasses. Like something was slowing me down and telling me to turn back and get away from where I was. My gut turned uneasily and my mouth felt dry with a sour tinge.

Something didn't feel right and I was beginning to regret this decision. Thoughts of turning back to get Michael so I wouldn’t go alone, thoughts of calling the police based on gut feeling, and thoughts of never again coming back to this park raced through my mind.

As I thought this, I broke through the tree line and froze, my hand gripping the handle breaks so tightly and fast that I almost flipped over the bike

Right in front of me, was a dead bison. A large dead bison, completely ripped apart. I've seen kills from wolves before, but this wasn't anything like what a normal animal could do. The lower half of the bison was gone, indulging bits of the front, like it was feasted upon by dozens of animals. But the ground was still wet with blood. Flies buzzed about the corpse, bits of what little organs it had left stretched out of the torso, the bull's face in a state of shock.

I felt sick rising in my throat and I gagged in-between my ragged breaths as I stared in horror. A cold sweat washed down my face and I pulled at my collar that felt tight around my neck, trying to wrap my head around this and I began to question what could have possibly done this?

Just then, I turned my gaze up to see a thick tail of blood that started a few meters away from the bison and led into a thicker foliage of trees, like something bleeding walked away from the scene. Or what I soon came to learn, carried.

I followed the trail and my eyes fell upon something past the light brown or base trees. I squinted to get a better look, before my eyes shot open when I saw something gigantic move through the forest. I couldn't see what it was, other than it was dark brown and black, and despite being bigger than anything I'd ever seen, it was moving too silently, only making noise whenever its massive frame pushed against the dense collection of foliage.

Every instinct I had screamed at me to turn heel, or wheel in this case, and get the hell out of there, and I obeyed them like a drone.

I bolted through the park as fast as I could, the trees and plants racing past me in blurs, my legs almost snapping the pedals with how hard I pumped them, but even if I broke the bike, I would just spring up and sprint out of there like I was gunning for gold.

I eventually made it to the main park, threw my bike aside and burst into the main office, startling Bob.

“Close the park!”

I remember screaming at him, my heart thundering in my chest, my mouth and throat dry and needing water.

“The fuck!? Why? What happened?” Bob asked me, shooting up from his chair.

I took a moment to catch my breath, coughing at how parched I was, but managed to find my words “There's something out there. It killed some bison and is way too close to the camping sites.”

“Something? What something?” Bob questioned me, confused, but still threw on his coat and adorned his hat, still taking me seriously.

“I don't know. But it was huge. Bigger than anything and it completely ripped apart a full grown bison.” 

In that moment, I realised how crazy I probably sounded, spurting out words of some giant predator in the woods. But lucky for me, Bob knew me for years and knew I wouldn't be making something as serious as this up.

He looked at me, half convinced, half thinking I was confused, but nodded and spoke into his walkie talkie to the other rangers and park managers about keeping escorting people out and stopping new visitors from entering. The reason he gave was that I had spotted a predator in the woods and it spooked the bison to wander too close to frequently used paths.

I let out a sigh of relief, thanking God that I didn't come across as completely insane and sat down, wiping the sweat off my brow and reached into the bag that I still had on me for some water.

For the rest of that day, I spent my time pacing around the room, nervously spying out the window and asking for Bob on any updates on the evacuation of the park. He would tell me that all the guests have left, the ones we found at least, and how nothing unusual was spotted.

I tried to relax, telling myself to take solace that people were out of harm's way, but the feeling that something was very wrong was unshakeable. 

“Hey, I'm going to call it a night.” Bob said to me as he began to make his way to our shared bedroom.

I looked over at him with a feeling of unease “Now? It's not that late.”

I asked him, not wanting to be the only one awake.

Bob scratched his nose with his finger and hung up his hat “Yeah, and you should probably get some sleep as well. You need it more than I do, actually.”

I stared at him for a good while, contemplating over his words and slowly nodded. “Yeah, sure. Okay, give me a second.”

Bob nodded back and went to our room, but I didn't follow him. He was right, I needed to rest and get some sleep for tomorrow, but I wasn't comfortable having no one be out for watch in case that thing wanders close by.

Whatever that was, I had no idea. Even if I really did mistake what could have been some shadow of a regular animal or a group of tightly-packed bison moving in the trees, that didn't explain what killed that large bull. Whether it be an animal of a group of sick humans, there was something dangerous out there.

I sighed and rubbed my eyes, taking another glance out the window. It was evening, the sun almost set and casting orange hues across the sky. It was quite beautiful in fact, and I slowly felt my nerves ease.

Despite my better judgement, I decided to get some air.

But I didn't do anything stupid like stroll through the woods or stand hundreds of meters away from the cabin, no. I just took a few steps outside of the front door that was partially opened, and stood there, taking deep breaths in and out.

The crisp air filled my lungs and senses, the tension in my muscles loosening and mind calming. The therapeutic effect this park had on me stayed true, even now. I was about to go back inside, but I stopped and became still.

I suddenly felt very uneasy and I didn't want to be out here anymore. I gulped and turned to my left to walk back inside, but as I faced that direction, I felt every cell in my body explode with panic and my blood ran cold.

Like a wrath, something had snuck up to stand a few long strides away from me, likely emerging from the trees behind the cabin, walked past the building and stopped to look down upon me.

Standing barely a few meters away, looming over me and the cabin with its great mass, was a long thought dead animal. It was insane and incompressible to believe to be true, but it was.

A T Rex. A full grown, gigantic, Tyrannosaurus Rex. Four meters or more at the hip, thirteen meters from nose to tail and if I were to bet, ten or likely more tons in weight. The body was dark brown, the top of the animal's neck, back and tail a thick black and even in the lowlight of the setting sun, I could see orange and tan colours on its massive head. 

The dinosaur looked down at me with a curious or pitiful expression in its amber coloured eyes. Its nostrils flared to breath or sniff the air, the small bristles of feathers on its head and neck standing on end before relaxing.

I stood there in shock, fear and awe, feeling like a mortal in the face of a god, mind reeling from this impossible reality. My knees shook, my heart raced and sweat ran down my head and neck in gallons. I could only stammer before I felt life rush back into me and I jumped back into the cabin and slammed the door shut with a loud bang.

I backed away from the door, my eyes darting over to the window and I gasped out a squeak.

The T Rex had walked up to the window and bowed its head to peer into the window, its eyes piercing into mine and I backed away from the window and pressed my head to the wall. It continued to look at me, tilting its head curiously, and I could see the intelligence in its eyes. A gleam of sentience that reflected my own, its pupils a black pool that carried memories of another world, far different than mine 

It sniffed deeply and opened its mouth, breathing on the glass and fogging it up. 

But even through the condensation, I could still see its huge, sharp and serrated teeth. They were long, sharp and teeth like railroad spikes, the sight of them making my heart tighten in my chest and I wanted to puke when I imagined what they could do to me. 

The T Rex continued to stare at me before it raised its head and left, the room brightening up now that the sun wasn't blocked out by a colossal predator.

I was still clinging to the wall for dear life as it made a sound, a deep hum that vibrated my body like a rumble. And just as I realised the source of that rumbling came from the dinosaur and this was what killed the bison, the sound escalated into a long, drawn out bellow, louder than a wolf howl, than a bear roar, louder than anything. The sound from an ancient world punched me in the chest and my knees collapsed and I curled up into a ball.

As the bellow ended and echoed out, Bob burst from the room in his pajamas and asked me what the hell was going on.

I didn't answer straight away and I could remember Bob trying to consult me so I could speak to him, but it took a while for me to temporarily push the events from my mind and focus on the then and now. I found myself sitting on my bed, shaking like a leaf and stuttering out words.

When I eventually choked out that there was a T Rex in the park, Bob looked at me like I was completely insane. I didn't blame him, what person in their right mind would have it any other way?

But, luckily for me, he did notice something definitely did shake me up and something had to make that vocalisation from before. Maybe not a T Rex, but definitely a creature or machine that should not be ignored.

He left me in the room to make some calls, but to whom, I had no idea.

Alone in our room, I took my laptop out and began to retail all of this in my docs, my fingers moving at light speed, but my body was still trembling. I took nervous glances out the window at times before closing the curtains and got back to work.

After I post this, I will likely call Sarah and tell her everything and hope she'll believe me. I have one finger on the dial button and the other still typing away in the keyboards as I finish this off.

To whoever reads this, be careful and warn whoever you can. Stay away from the woods, barricade your homes, don't leave unless you absolutely need to and bring a weapon.

The dinosaurs are back. Somehow and someway.
