Hey everyone it’s Josiah. I’m currently in the apartment with Madison and I’ve just waken up from the lucid dream process. I’m going to let the my story tell you how it went.

I’m back in the Rose Residence where I last left off. I pick myself up off the floor. I’m now standing in the hallway looking around and see no signs of Traum. Jim Rose notices me and starts talking.

“Joe. Do you remember the time when you and your friends would come by and help around the house with random chores.”

“Yes that was a long time ago. We were children and Rosaline makes great cookies.”

Like all children we were lured by sweets and in order to get what we wanted Jim and Rose came up with the idea to make us do chores for them. Clean kitchen and bathroom. Ordinary stuff people would make you do if you wanted something from them. 

“Jim was it painful. Becoming what you are now?”

“I don’t remember but what I do know is you need to find your friends. Jimmy and Cody were last together at the park. They had such potential to become someone greater. Best friends forever until the end.”

“Thanks Jim.”

I headed out immediately. Not taking my time to take in the silence and the rain. I made my way past the church and I’ll admit I cried a little. Looking in the opened doors and seeing Madison. Hurt my soul more than anything ever had. But I reminded myself that this is only a nightmare.

I continued past the church and got to the crossroads leading to the park. I see the gazebo my friends and I would go to after a long day of school. If what Jim says is correct. They should be there at the gazebo. I continue to approach and the first thing that gets me is the smell. It wasn’t rot but I think it was weed.

Jimmy and Cody would always have a couple ounces of weed on them wherever they went but this was definitely more than that. I’m now standing at the steps of the gazebo and notice a hole in the center of the gazebo itself. I start walking up the steps and hear sounds coming from the small pit in the center. At the top of the steps I notice the hole is filled with a large mass of flesh that had partially rotted. I assume this mass is Jimmy and Cody. And it begins to speak.

“You. You left us to die. You coward. You sicko you. You bad friend.”

Their mind must have rotted like much of their body. A sad sight to see but I needed answers.

“Where must I go to next.”

“River to school. You is asshole.”

“Quiet you two.”

I said as I was walking away. I then wake up from the nightmare. Madison was asleep next to me and I knowing what I need to do I go back to sleep.

I come back to it now at the river, the water itself was tainted and red. Bodies lined the shore and they were calling out. But need to find the next body of my friend. I continue along the shoreline and don’t see them.

I then notice a body trying to get my attention. I approached the body and find out it was my carpentry teacher who was trying to speak but it sounded like his lungs were filled with water.

“She…is…in…rive…in…bleh.”

“She’s in the river?”

“Yes…beh…ind…me.”

“Thank you Lanes.”

I then realized that she was on the opposite side of the river. I turn and notice something. A note sitting in the sand.

“This is my rendition of the river Styx from Greek mythology. From yours truly, Traum”

I don’t remember seeing the note there before but then again I don’t remember a lot of things and ignore it.

I make my way to the bridge and am just about to cross when I notice my friend standing at the other end of the bridge. Just standing normally looking at me. 

“Josiah come here! Do you recognize me?”

I recognize her alright. It was my best friend Carolyn. But her body was rotted and broken but she spoke perfectly. Like all the damage was surface damage and nothing internal.

“Joe please help me.”

“Carolyn… I don’t know this bridge looks a little unstable. Please stay where you are.”

“I don’t want to I want to see you up close.”

“I need answers first ok. Where’s Sadie?”

“Where she’s always at ya dumb.”

Sadie was a bookworm. Always wanted to read and write her own books.

“Ok Carolyn you can approach now.”

Honestly I forgot about the unstable bridge. She only made it half way when the thing collapsed on her and she drifted down stream.

“Welp bye Carolyn.”

I then started to walk to the library. Making my way down Main Street would be the fastest method but I chose to go a different way. I didn’t feel like going down Main Street. Especially after what happened in part 1. 

Halfway to the Library and I start hearing noises. They are coming from a large Victorian house on the corner of the street. Now. Where I’m standing is across the street from the house and all I see is a large mass of people all molded into one. All screaming in unison like a demonic choir. I think I heard them on the radio at the Rose Residents.

I pay little attention and continue to the library. The library itself was unassuming and had little horror. I make my way up the steps and still nothing strange. It wasn’t until I opened the that I noticed the smell of rot again. I enter the building and follow the smell to just around the corner. There in the corner of the room was Sadie. She was curled into a ball of rot still trying to read her book.

“You really like that book don’t you?”

“Josiah.”

She uncurled into a wrinkly sack of flesh that looked like a bean bag with arms and no legs.

“Sadie are you alright.”

“Never better.”

“Listen Sadie I.”

“Shush Josiah. Go to Madison. Face your fears. And speak to her. She wants to speak with you.”

Those were the exact words Sadie said to me before I went and asked Madison out. I thanked Sadie and ran out of the building and tripped on a rock at the top of the stairs.

I wake up again and look around the room. Madison still sleeping next to me so peaceful and she seems to be having a good dream. I go back to sleep.

I come to me falling down the concrete stairs and as I’m falling I notice I’m far more aware of things. And so I take control. I was now lucid dreaming and control was being given to me. I end up rolling perfectly and keeping the momentum I begin running to the church. I turn onto the street that leads to the church and am now only a block away before I notice what I think is a group of people running a street away from me except they are running with me towards the church. I think Traum knows what I’m trying to do.

Now on the same block as the church I notice the group running towards me and I can only think of running faster. And so I did. I ran faster than the group and was now at the church. The group was getting closer every second and I had to think fast. So I did the best thing I could think of. I begin barricading myself into the church.

The sounds the people made as they tried to get in. It was demonic. That’s the only way I can think of. It was just demonic. The screams the howling. They wanted me in the church. To make me go insane. Traum still had control but he was fighting for it.

I turn to look to Madison on the cross. I’m so familiar with the smell of rot from the bodies in the pews I didn’t even notice the smell. I began approaching Madison. Each step that I took was heavy and I felt the ever looming pressure of tears behind my eyes. Half way to her everything feels heavy. I feel like I’m carrying the guilt of not being there for her before she was killed. 

Now at the alter the weight is immense. Like I’m carrying a boulder. Now at the cross all the weight goes away and I slowly take Madison off the cross.

“Oh Madison. I’m so sorry.”

I break down in tears unable to bear the sight of her. She hasn’t rotted. She hasn’t bled. But her hands were a mess. And the scars of what Traum had done to her shown with perfection. There was a note in her hoodie. 

“He resides in his temple. Paradise Art Studio. Josiah. Get revenge for us.”

I wake up again and the sun is beginning to rise. I look to Madison and she has a worried look on her face but soon we will be free. With that I head back to sleep again.

I come back to where I was and I look to Madison for comfort. But all I feel is rage. For what Traum had done to her. What he had done to Jimmy and Cody, Carolyn and Sadie nothing would stop me from what I had to do. I make my way to my barricade and take it down.

The group of people who were screaming and howling all stood in a half circle stairing at me.

“You Josiah have been summoned by our great leader.”

“Fuck off”

I start walking to the studio. A little while later I come to the front of the studio and decide my next move. Traum had other plans.

“Boy I know I must die today but I have only one wish.”

“What do you want.”

“For you to take the tour!” 

“Why do you can gut me?”

“With that attitude yes. But I have already lost. You broke the seal with your lucid dreaming. I knew I should’ve killed that fucking native. But please take the tour.”

“If you will finally leave me and Madison alone then yes I’ll take the tour.”

“Thank you for your understanding. Right this way.”

As we enter the studio the sight is definitely something else.

“To the left here we have screaming Billy. Billy wouldn’t shut up as I skinned him alive so I put his skin up on display. His mouth still open.”

“Next we got a painting of the river before you broke the bridge.”

“Right next to you is the spine of your cat Ukie. Such a quick cat for being so fucking fat. I made his spine into a dagger.”

“Here we got my greatest piece yet. Your parents.”

So what he said was true. In part two he said he would get my parents and he stayed true to his word. My parents were both made into recliners.

“Come sit down will you.”


I lost it by this point. Traum brought me in here to try and show off and yeah it worked but I’m in control now. I grab the bone dagger and rush Traum. But he’s gone. I look around and find a staircase leading upstairs. The walls of the stairs are lined with pictures of gruesome scenes. The final picture was of me stabbing Traum in the neck. Now at the top of the stairs I look left and see Traum on the balcony. 

“Boy this is where it ends for us both.”

“No just you.” 

Then I stab his neck and twist it for good measure.

Then I wake up. I wake up to my favorite person looking at me with those beautiful eyes. 

“Did it work?”

“Yes Madison. I am free.”

Goodnight everyone sleep well.
