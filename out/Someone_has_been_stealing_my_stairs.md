This already sounds pretty ridiculous, I know, but bear with me.

I'm not crazy.

I've been pretty much of a loner my whole life - I haven't really had any desire to get married or have kids, and I think living alone is the best for me. I also consider myself to be a quite eccentric person - I like to have my own space, many rooms that I've transformed and color coded - I've got the Blue room, the Red room, and so on... made them into game rooms or studies or dressings. I like my life, and when I bought this house, I promised myself I wouldn't let the basement be too creepy. Every house has a creepy basement. Not mine though, I thought.

I wanted to remodel it, make it homey - but from the beginning it just seemed to not want to cooperate. It had this putrid smell imprinted on the walls, and the air kind of clung onto you and pinned you down - and then there was the feeling of being watched, which was odd in a room with no windows. I didn't know where it was coming from - it felt like I was watched from every angle.

Two sets of 18 steps led to the basement. It was really deep, but I didn't mind it - I didn't question the logic of the house, and I liked that the two sets were separated by a door, so that the humid, stinging smell downstairs wouldn't get too arrogant and wander upstairs. I turned it into some storage room - I didn't even want to do my laundry down there. I mostly kept the doors shut down there.

I had my mom over a few weeks ago. She went to the basement, searching for some boxes of old clothes I'd thrown down there, because all of a sudden she wanted to be this selfless person and *give back to the community* by donating to charity. Whatever, I thought. She could take whatever she wanted from down there - I didn't mind.

When she went back up, she kept complaining that her back hurt from carrying all that crap all the way to me. I told her that exercise makes the body wise - all 36 steps had to be earned. She widened her eyes. 

"36? That's a lot. You've got a whole bunker down there."

"Yeah, I guess. Keeps the smell down, though."

"Are you sure there's 36 of them, and not less? Didn't feel like 36 to me."

"Go ahead and count them if you want."

She did, and returned panting. "You were close. There's 33 of them."

"Really? I counted them myself."

"Yeah."

I opened the door to the basement, went down the first set (18), then, when I turned right and opened the second door, I stopped. The floor of the basement seemed somewhat closer to me. I counted the stairs, and sure enough, I only counted 15. Even though I used to be positive both sets of steps were equal.

I descended and cursed the putrid smell. When I got down, I saw that most of the boxes were opened. I looked around - the room wasn't so big, and looked unfinished - I wanted to lay down some wooden planks and maybe put up some wallpaper, one or two chairs... just to make it feel less... unsettling. The lightbulb hanging from the ceiling didn't do it justice, either - the warm light barely made it to the far left boxes and the piles of clothes behind them.

I turned and went up to the first door, then stopped. I don't keep piles of clothes laying on the basement floor. 

"Mom, did you drop some clothes on the ground? They were freshly washed, and there's a lot of dust down there..."

"What? No, I didn't."

I wasn't even sure that I'd seen *clothes.* Just, um, a pile of stuff. A general shape. I turned and stared and the basement floor, a few steps separating us. 

Then, I heard shuffling from beneath me.

Yep, that was it. I shut both of the doors behind me and promised myself to only return with an exterminator. 

I did, after a week or so. When he opened the second door, a wave of dizziness hit me.

The basement floor was now closer, separated from us only by 9 steps. I couldn't explain to the exterminator why I was so freaked out by this aspect, but I let him check out the room and he returned, saying nothing was down there. No rats, no racoons, no cats. Nothing.

Over the next days, my friends and family had all seen this phenomenon, and I began wondering if the house was just sinking. That was the most reasonable explanation. 

One night, my boyfriend slept over. He kept complaining that he heard sounds coming from the basement, like dragging and random scratches. I kept insisting he should be brave and go check it out, and finally he did. I followed him as closely as I could, but kept somewhat of a 6 step distance between us. When he reached the door to the second flight of stairs, he opened it to reveal the basement floor, submerged in darkness, only two steps down. 

We both fell silent, unable to form any coherent thoughts. 

"I wanna turn to you now, but I'm kind of afraid to turn my back on this room." he muttered. I was pretty high up, so my flashlight only covered the two steps and a small portion of the basement.

"So... is the house sinking?" I asked, my voice trembling.

"I don't know if the house is sinking or if this room is coming *up.*"

"That's crazy."

"I need light. Come closer."

My chest felt hollow, but I stepped down. "Listen, let's just take a picture using the flash and then get out. This is freaking me out."

He agreed, and waited for me to get closer to him and then take the picture. Then, we both slammed the door shut and noped the fuck out of there.

Upstairs, we finally made out the courage to check it.

It showed my boyfriend Bryan squinting because of the flash, and the interior of the basement, right behind him, rusty pipes, stained walls and piled up boxes. A figure was standing right behind Bryan, a figure we couldn't have seen due to the darkness, that had only been revealed by the flash. The silhouette was crouched over, revealing its bare back, sickly pale, the color a rat would have. I couldn't make out much, due to my hands shaking as I'd taken the picture. I didn't make out a face or any intentions, but the sight of it was enough for me. 

I don't know what was more terrifying - the thing itself, which could have been a squatter, or the fact that it had been standing so close to Bryan while the two of us contemplated going further down.

I don't want to be around when the basement floor swallows the remaining steps. I don't want to be around when I open the first door and step directly into the room, and, most certainly, I don't want to be there when the thing that keeps making noise down there realizes that the door works both ways.
