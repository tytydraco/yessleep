So I'm a senior in high school.I've always been considered one of the "weirdos" for as long as I can remember throughout my school days

I have few,but very close friends who are also a lot like me.There's Me,Kyle,Josie,Sarah and Mason ...we are called the..."Suicide Squad" by mostly everyone 

Tasteless I know.We love anime,video games,animals etc.Pretty much everything we like is considered weird in this school by the majority.

And that brings me to the next point.I went to a public, but also a very high class high school with most of the students coming from rich homes that go here.

The school also takes sports VERY seriously here .Tennis,Soccer,Volleyball,Baseball,Basketball,Football ,and so on

And if your not a star athlete ,along with being at least a B grade student,you might as well enjoy hanging with people like me here


Ok I'm sorry for dragging this non-important shit on.I need to tell someone what happened to me,in hopes that someone will actually believe me


It all happened 5 weeks ago on a Friday afternoon at lunch

 We "Suicide Squader's" were all sitting at our table, shooting the shit and trying to enjoy our food when Cai "Cash" Morabito came strolling by

The dude is a total dick.He is the Running Back and Safety on the football team and also is a center fielder on the baseball team

He thinks he's so great and he "earned" the nickname Cash because he thinks that every thing he does is "So cash" 

He had this shit eating grin on his face as he stopped in front of us,flaunted himself in his light red football jersey and spoke to us 

*Hey there future school shooters.Hope you guys will be at the game tonight to cheer yours truly on in the playoffs*

I looked at my friends and we all rolled our eyes as he knew none of us were really into sports .Cai smirked at us and spoke again

*Oh that's right.You freaks don't even play any  sports. Hell,you losers don't know how to play with anything besides yourselves*

The people sitting by, that were close enough to hear what he said to us bursted out in laughter,followed by others that were told what was so funny

Cai walked away satisfied ,knowing that he embarrassed us all.A bunch of other popular people were high fiving him as he walked to his "jock table"


My friend group decided to end our lunch early and got up to leave the lunch room


A popular girl named Maziee (Cheerleader and volleyball player)threw an orange at Josie's face that barely missed her

Once we were at the exit door,it opened and another person was walking into the room.Only it wasn't a person.It was the mascot of the school

You see ,Our sports team's  are called the Prospecters, and that's exactly what out mascot is

He honestly looks alot like the mascot of the NFL team The San Fransisco 49ers.I only know that because I've heard people mention it before

He has a medium sized beard with a goofy, catroonish smile and a big miner hat with huge eyes as well

Once he walked in,everyone else in the room cheered when they saw him and he began running around the room and high fiving everyone and started dancing .

He was doing  the stupid "trendy" dances as well which only made my friends and I leave even quicker than we originally tried to .


Once we were out of there ,Kyle breathed a sigh of relief.

*God,I can't wait until we graduate in the summer and never deal with this meathead school again*

The rest of us agreed completely and Josie mentioned how much she wanted to jump Maizee after she tried to hit her with an orange.


But she and the rest of us knew that Josie would get all the blame and trouble for it all as the principal was just like most of the school.


We all tried our best to get through the rest of the day ,ignoring the idiots the best we could.

I had my last period with Cai and 3 of his friends and teammates sitting behind me.I felt at least 5 pieces of paper smack the back of my head during class .

All 4 of them snickered and whispered behind my back as much as possible during class


Once the day was over,I was walking to my car when I noticed him.The school mascot standing only 10 feet away behind my car


*What's the big idea?* 

 I asked him,honestly expecting whoever was in that stupid thing to answer.But he just stood there motionless,staring foward.


I had enough of the shit for one day.I rolled my eyes and walked straight up to him and attempted to shove the bastard


But it was like he was 600 pounds and he didn't even move back.He then grabbed me by the thoat and lifted me into the air with ease.I was shocked

I'm not even a really skinny person either and whoever was inside couldn't have been that big or strong but somehow they managed to do it


The damn mascot just stared into my soul as I gasped for air, at his mercy.I didn't see anyone else in the parking lot as I walked through it either

I was all alone with this crazy person in a costume.As I was about to pass out,I suddenly felt his grip let go of me as I was dropped to the ground

I was gasping for air and when I finally regained myself,

I slowly looked up at the mascot,expecting Cai,or one of Cai's friends or at least another jock.Perhaps a wrestler (due to the persons strength)

 To yank the head off and laugh at me as a nearby hiding crowd would show themselves to mock me,expecting several phones out recording it all



But no.The mascot offered out a hand down to me to help me up.I hesitantly took his hand and was yanked up easily 

We stared at each other for what felt like forever before he pulled my head near his face and I heard a whisper that sounded inhuman coming from him



*I hope to see you and your friends at the game tonight.Big playoff game against a big rival.Don't disappoint me Mikey*


I stood there frozen in place.No one and I mean NO ONE besides my friends have ever called me Mikey.Why would this person do it?

The mascot then slowly turned from me and headed back towards the school entrance.I managed to get a hold of myself and get in my car and headed home


I felt so uneasy for the rest of the afternoon .I decided against telling my parents what happened as they wouldn't believe me any way.


I did text Mason about it after a couple of hours and he responded within seconds after I sent it.I expected him to think I was kidding

But he sent a message which sent a strange feeling throughout my body


*That is no ordinary mascot dude.We all have to be at the game tonight.I'll explain later.Be ready to go*

I thought this had to be a prank.Was Mason in on it in order to lose his reputation as a loser? What did he mean by "not an ordinary mascot?" I soon found out


After awhile of convincing  the rest of our friends to go to the game,we all met in front of the football staduim before kickoff

Sarah looked to be the most confused and annoyed


*I hate sports.Why did you and Mason insist on all of us coming?*

Mason and I looked at each other,unsure of how to tell the others as to why we begged them to come.Finally I decided to make something up


*Mason and I have a hillarous way of getting back at a few of these jocks.But it will happen after the game.Just come enjoy the show*


Mason looked at me with a bewildered look on his face but turned on the act in a heartbeat once he turned to the rest of the group.

*Mike is right.We just knew you guys wouldn't show up unless we kept bugging you.Let's head inside!*

The other 3 looked amused  and followed behind Mason and I into the staduim.A lot of people there were shocked to see us being there.


A few underclassmen laughed at us and threw up their hands and shouted  *Don't shoot*  before running off and howling with laughter .


I felt someone's foot try to trip me up, followed by snickering as we made our way up the bleachers stairs to find seats.


Once the game was about to start,I saw the mascot run onto the field with the cheer squad (with Maizee being the leader)

I could literally feel Josie's blood boiling when she saw Maizee out there,cheering and smiling as if she was a perfect angel.


My focus was mainly on the mascot.He was semi- mimicking the cheer routine but kept "messing up" to bring laughter to the crowd.


I looked over at Mason and his face was pure white with what appeared to be fear .I honestly was feeling pretty similar myself.


Once the cheering ended and the cheer team began departing to the sidelines,the mascot stayed put and and quickly turned his head towards ME.


I began sinking into my seat with my eyes closed as if by pure enstint,hoping that would make him leave me alone.


I felt a finger poking me after a minute and opened my eyes to see Sarah looking at me with a strange look on her face.


*What's wrong?*  She asked


I felt my face turn red as I looked at her and around me and noticed a few other people in the crowd also noticed what I did.I knew I had to lie fast.


*I was just already feeling bored by being at this dumb thing.I just want to get to what we came here to do but oh well*


Sarah looked at me with a not-so-sure look on her face before nodding and turning back towards the field.


*Smooth Mike..smooth*  I thought to myself


The game started and our team won pretty easily.Cai had to be the star of the show and he scored 2 touchdowns and had an interception as well.


Thankfully,the mascot acted normal for the rest of the game .Typical dances,joking around etc.I was hoping that it really was just a huge joke.


Once the game was over.The crowd jumped up and cheered for our team.

The whole team stood in the middle of the field with their helmets raised in the air as the cheer team stood in front of them waving thier poms poms.


My friends and I were barely interested and turned to leave the stands when we saw someone blocking the stair way...the mascot


Holding several automatic guns in each arm.


My friends and I all looked around expecting someone to notice this and stop him but when we looked around...everyone was frozen in place.


The crowd,the football team and cheerleaders were stiff as boards. All of them with huge smiles and wide eyes on their faces ...so happy looking.


All of us were terrified as we turned back to look at the "mascot" who then tossed the guns into the air that somehow landed in each of our arms.



*Do it* 

That same Inhumane whisper demanded coldly.

As if we were all hypnotized ,each of my friends and I all pointed our weapons at the frozen people all around us in different directions.


My weapon was facing towards the field,directly at Cai.


His face much like everyone else.Frozen in happiness.His gold helmet raised in the air after a great game.


My finger began to pull the trigger when out of nowhere every thing went black.


My vision returned to the sound of screams all around me.Everyone around us saw that my friends and I all had guns pointed at them.


In shock and confusion,we all set the guns down an pleased the panicked crowd to relax and we tried to tell them we wouldn't hurt anyone.


I know...hard to believe at that point.



Many of the members in the audience ran away but other people began tackling us to the ground.Before we all knew it,police showed up and cuffed us all.


None of us had an alibi and I'm sure the rest of my friends besides Mason had no idea what to make of this whole thing.


We all remained silent.We were all silent do to being in shock over what just happened anyway.

I saw Cai giving his statement to police before glaring at me.The jackass was going to get even more attention now.


I could already see the headlines


"Star Football player nearly killed by weird loner after playoff victory on Friday night"


As I was loaded into the back of the cop car,I looked out the window and saw the mascot still standing on the field alone 

He was making body and hand motions as if he were laughing hysterically while pointing at
me.




So here's what's happening now

My friends and I are all facing serious charges of gun possession,Consiracy to commit murder,attempted murder etc..

I write this from my cell.I'm hoping for a bond but not counting on it.I'll probably never leave.

Maybe I actually did die somehow and this is some kind of hell for me.


I'm stuck here in this jail from hell.To make matters worse,Every prision guard here has the head of that damn mascot.


That stupid beard ,those huge eyes and that weird hat are all I see.They never speak either.They just come to my cell door and state at me for hours .


As I curl into the back of my cell and beg them to stop and leave me alone.


Please,believe me...Please help me.
