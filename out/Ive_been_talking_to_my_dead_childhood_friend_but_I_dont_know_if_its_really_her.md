Sometimes life sucks. You're born, a perfectly normal and innocent baby, and life decides to say fuck you and give you misery and pain. Sometimes, life decides to make your parents give you up to the foster system at birth, and sometimes, life decides to make your best friend in the world die when you're thirteen and make you have a child at 25 unexpectedly and then it decides to get you divorced from your wife and then make you a single father. All just for shits and giggles. 

As I walked down the hallway of my cramped apartment, past the family photos with a certain somebody's face ripped out, I thought about it. Why hadn't I gotten over this yet? So, something bad happened to a friend of mine when we were thirteen. It had been 22 years since Kaitlyn had died. And yet I still grieved as if it was yesterday, I even named my goddamn daughter after her. I'd give anything to talk to Kaitlyn again, just joke around and have my best friend back. And now, thinking about it, that makes me sound even more pathetic, the fact that a dead 13-year-old who I haven't seen in over 20 years is my best friend, and that my second best friend after that is probably my ten-year-old daughter. 

I knocked on my daughter Katie's bedroom door. 

"Come in!" She called. She was, unsurprisingly, awake before me. 

"Morning, sweetie! I saw that the state fair opened today. You want to check it out with me? 

Katie smiled at me, nodding her head. We got ready and headed out to the fair. 

It was a humble little place, as to be expected in our small town. There weren't any rides, but it had plenty of fried food and games to keep my daughter and I occupied. Right as I thought we had gone everywhere, Katie pointed to a purple tent.

"Dad, dad, check it out! Psychic tent, can we go? Maybe we can talk to Kaitlyn." She said. Of course Katie had known about Kaitlyn, it was only right that I taught her about the girl she was named after. Throughout the years Katie had seen Kaitlyn as a sort of guardian angel, watching over her whenever there was danger. 

I didn't believe in fortune tellers or any of that crap, but I decided to humour it, because after all, what was the worst that could happen? 

As we entered the tent, we were greeted by a strange old lady. She held a strange device in her hand. It was essentially a digital Ouija Board, you talked into it and the message would appear on the screen.

"Go on," The lady said. "Ask it something. I have a feeling you have someone you want to talk to." She winked.

I grabbed it from her hands. "Who am I talking to?" I asked, not expecting a response. 

I watched as the letter sprawled out on the screen.

KAITLYN

Katie and I exchanged glances. 

"Coincidence?" I whispered and she shrugged. 

"No coincidences in my tent." The lady said. "Ask it another question." 

"Who did I name after you?" 

DAUGHTER

"Woah." Katie said.

"You can take it for the night. But usually you can only talk to the person you're reaching out to for about a day. The spirit can only talk to you longer if you invite it to, but I strongly don't recommend that." The psychic lady said.

"Why not?" I asked.

"Don't ask questions."

I thought that was rude, so I took it from her hands. "I'll do whatever I want with this, thank you.

"Fine. Do it. Don't say I didn't warn you." The lady said, ushering us out of the tent.

"But wait-" I said, but she pushed us away.

"Goodbye!" She waved, and bent down to my daughter's height. "And good luck." 

Katie and I got home and spent pretty much the rest of the day talking to Kaitlyn, asking her questions, making sure it was her.

"Who was our arch nemesis in school?"

BECKY JOHNSON

"I still hate her." I said under my breath, and Katie giggled. 

"Where was our secret hideout?" 

TREEHOUSE

Katie tapped me on the shoulder. "Dad? Can I ask Kaitlyn a question?"  
"Of course, of course. Go ahead."  
She took a deep breath.

"Do you watch over me all the time? Like my dad said you do?" 

I WATCH YOU

Katie smiled. "See, dad? She IS my guardian angel!" 

"Of course she is, sweetie." I said, and she yawned. "Bedtime?" I asked, and she nodded.

"Night dad. And goodnight Kaitlyn." 

GOODNIGHT

The machine wrote.

Even after Katie went to bed, I stayed up sitting on my bed, talking to my long-lost friend.

"Do you remember me? Everything about me?

NEVER FORGET

"Where are you? Like, here, or in the spirit realm, or something, I don't know."

IN YOUR ROOM

I looked around my room.

"Prove it." 

Just then, a watch on my bedside table flew off, crashing on the floor. I smiled. It was true. 

"Do you have to go after tonight?"

YES.

I thought about what the psychic lady said. 

"Stay longer. As long as you want. I allow it." I said. It took a while longer to respond this time.

I WILL STAY 

It finally said. With that, I was satisfied. 

"Goodnight, Kaitlyn. See you tomorrow." 

SEE YOU LATER

From that day on, Kaitlyn was part of our family. We set out an extra chair for her at meals, we'd talk to her, it was like I was finally part of something for once. The only thing was, we could never hear her voice. I asked her to say something once, and the device wrote,

CANT TALK TO HUMANS. THEY CANT HEAR ME

I would spend all night talking to her, about my life, catching up on the 22 years we spent without each other. For a few weeks, this was paradise.

But as time wore on, things got... weird. Kaitlyn started answering in more ominous ways.

"Where are you right now?"

YOU KNOW WHERE

It got worse when Katie would try to talk to her.

"Kaitlyn, I'm scared of the dark." 

IT WILL EMBRACE YOU

Then came the other things. Cupboards would slam open and shut at night, lights would turn on and off, sometimes Katie's door would jam shut, leaving her trapped. 

"Kaitlyn, what happened?" I asked, after weeks of this mess.

YOU LET ME IN

I had enough of this bullshit. I grabbed the device and stormed over to the same goddamn tent we got it from.

"Okay, what kind of sick joke is this? This thing is terrifying my daughter and I." I demanded to the old psychic.

She shook her head. "Your old friend is being defiant?"

"Oh, it's more than defiant. Slamming cupboards, telling my daughter to embrace the dark, jamming her door shut? Poor Katie is scared to death."

The lady looked confused. "And you can hear your friend, right? Physically, her voice and presence is around?" 

"No, of course not. Kaitlyn already told me; ghosts can't talk to humans. They can't hear them."

The psychic lady looked up, scared. 

"No... oh, no no no, that's not true. Human entities can hear human entities, non human entities can hear non human ones. You should've been able to communicate with Kaitlyn without the device at this point. Unless she wasn't really Kaitlyn."

"You mean this entire time, the... thing I was talking to, was... something else?"

"I'm afraid so. But you didn't let it in, did you?"

I looked at her silently, and she rolled her eyes. 

"Oh for heaven's sakes, at least you're safe out here. As long as you're not in the house, you're fine." 

Katie. Katie was still in the house. I grabbed the device. "Where are you, right now, whatever you are?"

KATIE.

"Shit," I cried. "Shit, shit shit. It has my daughter." 

"The lady frantically grabbed a silver mirror and a pair of glasses. "Take this. The mirror can trap evil souls, and the glasses make all entities visible to the human eye. Good and evil." I grabbed it from her hands and sprinted back to the apartment.

I opened the door to complete chaos. The cupboards were all slamming at once, the lights were constantly flickering on and off, and worst; Katie's screams. 

I busted open her door to find her pinned against the wall, an invisible force tugging at her. 

But something didn't look right.

It looked like she was getting pushed and pulled at the same time.

Like two separate things were fighting for her. 

I cautiously put the glasses on. I was shocked to see two entities.

One was a gaunt looking creature with sunken eyes and pale skin, pulling at my daughter's arms, trying to grab her.

The other, was protecting her, pinning her against the wall with all her force. An all-too familiar face, one that I had seen in my head every day for twenty-two years.

Kaitlyn. She was saving my girl.

"Dad! Daddy, help!" Katie cried, and I saw a note on the back of the mirror.

*To trap spirits in the mirror:*

I shouted the words out loud:

"Abiit spiritu, non iam receperint vos, ivi, isse, isse, isse!"

Suddenly, a large gust of wind sucked the demon trying to kill my daughter into the mirror, with no more struggle than a vacuum cleaner sucking up a crumb. The lights slowly turned back to normal, and the cupboards all closed at once. 

I watched through the glasses as Kaitlyn gently set my daughter down. I picked Katie up. She was unconscious, but breathing, and she seemed to be okay. I smiled at Kaitlyn.

"Helping out, huh?" I said.

"Well, after all, you did say I was her guardian angel." Kaitlyn said. Tears filled my eyes as I heard her voice again. 

"You can't stay, now can you?" I asked.

"No. Unless you want to invite me to stay?" 

"Never again." I said, and we laughed.

"Thank you, Kaitlyn. For everything." 

"It was my duty to protect Katie. Now it's my duty to return home. So long, old friend. Until we meet again." 

"So long, Kaitlyn. I hope to see you again." 

"Yeah. Again." She said, and took the sleeping Katie from my hands as they both started to slowly disappear.

"Wait, what are you-" 

"I told you. It was my duty to protect Katie, as was yours. And you have failed at protecting her. She's coming with me. I'm sorry, friend. This is how things must go. I must protect her."

"But, I-" 

"Goodbye. I'm sorry you could not protect your daughter." Kaitlyn said, and they both disappeared, leaving me by myself.

I cried, knowing I just lost the two most important things to me. I was alone. But it was my fault.

It was the way things had to be.
