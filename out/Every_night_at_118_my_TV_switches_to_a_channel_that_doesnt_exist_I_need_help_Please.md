I don’t even know how to start this. The broadcast… it’s over, and the TV is just a broken old set again. The screen is shattered, the glass jagged, the inside empty like always, nothing but the hollow box of an old TV. But I know what I just saw. I can’t shake it. My hands are still trembling, my chest won’t stop tightening, and every corner of this room feels wrong. I know it isn’t over yet, I can feel it. I just don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow. I’m scared.

When the broadcast began tonight, Stan was sitting beside me. He didn’t believe me, not fully, but after the things I told him — the static, the preacher, my grandmother in the pew — he agreed to come over. 

The screen snapped on at 1:18 sharp, and the moment the preacher opened his mouth, Stan went pale. He grabbed my arm, whispering, “What the hell is this?” like he’d stepped into something he couldn’t get out of.

The preacher’s words slowed, dragged down like a record spinning at the wrong speed, until the sound behind them broke loose. That laugh. That wet, crackling laugh, filling the room as the shadows deepened around the pulpit. The thing leaned into the frame, its spiral eyes burning through the static, and then I heard it. Not muffled, not distorted. Clear. Directed at me.

"Do you remember, boy? The night you left him out in the cold? Ohhh, I do."

Stan stiffened beside me. He looked at me, waiting for me to explain, but my throat had locked shut. The thing kept laughing, its jagged rows of teeth clicking like glass tapping together.

"Poor puppy, scratching at the door, whining and whining. But you were so mad, weren’t you? You thought, ‘Let him stay out. Serves him right.’"

I shook my head before I even realized I was doing it, whispering “Stop.” But the demon only leaned closer, the camera shaking like it couldn’t contain its shape.

"And he cried for you," it hissed. "He cried until he didn’t anymore. He curled up by the step, little breaths slowing, slower, and slower, and slower. And you never opened the door."

Stan whispered, “What is it talking about?” His eyes were wide, locked on me now, not the screen. I couldn’t answer him. I couldn’t breathe. The memory I’d buried for years — the one I’d never told a soul — was unspooling in front of us, and the thing was enjoying it.

It clapped its long hands together, fingers too many and too thin, like a child delighted with its own cruel game. “Oh, the look on your face in the morning!” it shrieked, wheezing laughter rattling like knives in a jar. “When you opened the door and found him stiff as stone. You carried that forever, didn’t you, boy?”

I felt sick. I wanted to scream, to shut the TV off, to run out of the room — but the thing was still leaning closer. The spirals in its eyes spun faster, drawing my vision into them until I could feel it behind me, breathing on the back of my neck.

Stan stumbled backward, his chair scraping the floor, his voice breaking: “Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?” He was trembling, staring at me like he didn’t recognize me anymore. But the demon wasn’t interested in him. Its teeth flashed, endless rows splitting into new rows, and it whispered through the static:

"You never told. You never confessed. But I know. I’ll always know. And now… so does he."

Stan kept staring at me like he was waiting for me to deny it. Like maybe I’d laugh it off and tell him it wasn’t true. But I couldn’t move. The thing on the screen was laughing too hard for me to even think straight.

"He begged, boy. He begged for you with every whimper. His little paws on the door, his little breath fogging the air. And you lay in bed, angry, pretending not to hear. Oh, I heard."

Its voice shifted higher, mocking, turning singsong like a cruel nursery rhyme. “Cold, cold, cold, colder still… and all alone he lay so still.” The teeth chattered together in rhythm, and the static buzzed like applause.

Stan muttered, “Jesus Christ, what the fuck is this?” His voice cracked in a way I’d never heard before. He wasn’t asking me anymore. He was asking the air, the house, the thing itself.

The demon leaned further forward. The spirals in its eyes spun faster, tugging at my stomach until I thought I’d throw up. Its voice softened into something playful, like it was sharing a private joke.

"And the best part, boy? You never told anyone. You carried it like a stone in your chest, all these years. Pretending to forget, but I’ve been watching. I was there when he froze. I was there when you cried. And I’ll be here when you break."

I clutched my knees so tight my fingernails dug into my skin. My mouth was dry, my chest tight, and the sound of its laughter shook through the floorboards like nails being dragged through wood.

Stan shouted, “Turn it off! Turn it the fuck off!” He lurched forward, reaching for the plug, but the TV snapped brighter, the screen flaring white until it burned shapes into our eyes.

The preacher was still at the pulpit, mouthing silent words now. The demon had taken center stage. It bent its long frame across the preacher like a cloak, its teeth grinning wide enough to stretch ear to ear.

"Do you feel him, boy? Right outside? Every night you hear the whine, don’t you? Every scrape at the door? He’s waiting where you left him. Cold. Alone. And he’s so very hungry."

I screamed, louder than I thought I could. Stan froze where he stood, his face twisted with something between horror and pity. He turned to me, his lips trembling like he wanted to say something, but the demon’s laughter swallowed his words whole.

The spirals in its eyes weren’t just spinning now — they were widening, pushing closer, stretching beyond the frame. The flicker of the lights matched the pull in my chest, like my heart was being dragged across the room toward the screen.

"Come closer, boy," it whispered. "It’s time you learned what happens when secrets rot too long in the dark."

The screen pulsed once, hard enough that the whole room seemed to lurch. A spiderweb crack spread across the glass, splintering outward in jagged lines. Before either of us could move, the TV buckled inward, glass falling not onto the carpet but vanishing into the screen like stones dropping into water. There were no wires behind it. No circuitry. Just a blackness so deep it felt like standing at the edge of a well at midnight.

The whine at the door cut off mid‑breath. The frost on the windowpanes climbed higher, each filament crawling toward the ceiling like veins. The temperature plummeted, our breath hanging in front of our faces. Stan grabbed my arm, whispering my name, but his voice sounded far away, muffled under a sound like air being sucked through a hole.

The void inside the TV wasn’t empty. Spirals of pale light shifted deep within it, spinning in slow, nauseating patterns, like looking down a drain that never ended. The demon’s laughter rolled out of it now, clear and soft and everywhere at once. “Come closer, boy,” it hissed. 

The floorboards trembled beneath us, a low groan rising from the wood as if the house itself were holding its breath. Stan shouted, “Turn it off!” but there was nothing left to turn off. The TV was gone. Only the void remained, black and endless, framed by the shards of glass.

For a heartbeat I swore I heard claws at the edge — faint scratching, a thin whine threading through the cold, so close it could have been inside the room. I turned, but there was nothing. Only frost, only shadows. When I looked back, the void didn’t move. It didn’t grow. It was just there, a hole where the world ended.

And then the broadcast ended. The blackness folded back into the shattered screen, leaving only jagged glass and silence behind.
