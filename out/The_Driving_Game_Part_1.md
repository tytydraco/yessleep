I need to make some things clear before I let you read this story. 

First of all. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. If it's real, it is extremely dangerous as you will soon learn.

Second of all, I am turning to this place because I am out of hope and options. It is my sister who tells this story, but as you'll soon find out, she is unable to share it with you. I will share with you the important context before I give you her story.

My sister, Alexandra Allen, left home a year ago. About six months later, she stopped talking to us. She Disappeared from snapchat and didn't reply to our calls. We contacted the school, but didn't get a reply. This behavior wasn't entirely unusual for her, so we assumed the school would have taken its time to reply if something had happened. 

But last week I found two letters outside our door. On the envelopes, it read:

"The Driving Game. To Harry."

My name's Harry. The Driving Game didn't mean anything for me, but when I read the contents within, my heart dropped. It's my sister telling the story, I know her mannerisms and her personality. It isn't faked. I also know how much of a cynic she is. She hates everything that has to do with fantasy and such, she wouldn't make this up. 

I think she is in serious danger, and I need your help.

***The Driving Game - Letter 1***

&#x200B;

My name is Alexandra Allen, and I am writing this log to document and discredit the so-called "Driving Game". In front of me, sits experienced explorer Christopher Anderson, telling me about the background of the game. 

**Chris:** It was discovered a decade ago I think, though it is still not known by many. 

**Alex:** How many know about it?

**Chris:** A small internet community. It's hard to say how many, you can play it all over the world. 

Christopher has had an interesting life, chasing these "supernatural" games and places. He has climbed mountains, seen the world, but the only thing he seems to enjoy talking about, is this game. 

**Alex:** Why did it catch your interest?

**Chris:** There was proof, logs, descriptions and pictures. It seemed far too elaborate to be an internet hoax. I thought it was worth a look. 

The first rule is a bit weird, you are to turn off your car at midnight, and turn the engine on at 03:33, leaving all your lights on. I already dread the waiting we will have to be doing in between that time. 

A knock on the door interrupts our conversation. Christopher stands up immediately, almost running for the door. I am then introduced to Jackson and Mabel Thorne. A married couple roughly the same age as Christopher. Mabel sweet and polite, Jackson stern and cold. 

**Mabel:** You're the cynic? 

I have to chuckle at that.

**Alex:** I guess I am. 

**Mabel:** I'm not sure I believe it either, but Jax seems set in his ways. 

I smiled at her.

**Alex:** I see your call sign is Bo, why did you pick that?

**Mabel:** Our daughter called me May-bo for a long time, so it was a pretty easy choice.

She laughs and grabs her husbands arm. 

The rest of the crew arrives in orderly fashion. Second to arrive is Oliver Mallory. He seems like the friendliest man on earth, all smiles and laughter. 

**Olly:** Whether I believe or not? I just want to turn my luck around!

He bursts out laughing at his own attempt at a joke, he then shows his equipment to a satisfied Christopher. 

After him, a ghost hunter named Braiden arrives. 

**Braiden:** I chose Ghost as my call sign, because I'm a ghost hunter, you know?

I nod hesitantly and walk over to Christophers car. He drives a tall, armored car, with a mountain of supplies in the back, neatly organized and sorted. 

**Chris:** Can't over prepare for a ride like this. We'll set off in about five minutes, you sure you're up for this?

**Alex:** I'm sure.

He nods with a child-like smile on his lips, ready to prove me wrong. 

We set off about an hour before midnight, as to not start the game in the middle of the city. When the clock reached 23:50, he checks in on his CB Radio and delivers his first message. 

**Chris:** Unit, this is Chris. We pull over here. Everyone keep your car and radio on, wait for my order. 

He pulls over and checks the big, analogue clock on the deck of the car. He has distributed one to each of the cars, painstakingly tuned to 100% accuracy. We sit on the side of the road for ten minutes, everyone turns down their windshields and turns on every light in the car. I must admit the silence in our car makes my heart pound a little. Then the clock strikes 23:59.

**Chris:** In one more minute, turn off your engine. The car must be on, the lights on You need to turn it off at precisely midnight, if not, you're out of the game before it starts. 

The seconds crawl away, and in the moment the day turns, Chris turns the car off. Every engine goes silent at the same time, leaving only silence in their wake.

The waiting that follows is both insanely boring, and cold. The wind taunts me, and I begin to wonder if this was worth it. I reach for the door, but my hand is pulled away by Christopher. 

**Chris:** You signed up for this. No-one leaves the car until we're in the game. 

I think I fell asleep, because the sound of Chris grabbing the CB radio rattles me.

**Chris:** Unit, this is Chris. We're close to the moment now. Everyone knows the drill, engine on, windshields up, down and up. 

Every car engine bursts alive simultaneously. Sparking life into the empty street. I turn to face a focused Christopher, turning his windshield up and down, and up again. The other cars do the same. The wind blows heavily in the moments that follow, and I find myself glad we ended up with the windshields up. 

**Chris:** The game is on. *The Guide* will show up in five minutes, it will guide me and Alex first, then go by formation. Now, this is important, don't lie to it! It will know if you do. 

Mabel then checks in on the radio. It crackles as the first sound reaches us.  

**Mabel:** Chris, this is Bo. What happens if we lie?

**Chris:** You don't lie to it. Do not ask questions back either. You only answer it.

The next five minutes are spent in silence, I look outside, but the darkness of the night swallows much of my vision. I yawn and close my eyes, almost falling asleep. 

The backdoor slams shut. I didn't even hear it open. My eyes are wide open as a dark voice booms from behind us. 

**The Guide:** Are you ready?

**Chris:** Yes.

Chris sounds unfazed. His eyes fixed on the road as we pull out onto it. I breathe in ragged breaths as I look at the rearview mirror, and catch a glimpse of the backseat. 

There is a man sitting there, with a giant hood covering his face. His pale hands are placed firmly on his thighs, still as death. The silence is almost unbearable, but when his voice booms again, I find myself wishing it had stayed. 

**The Guide:** Why do you play this game?

I can feel his eyes burning in my neck. I don't look back at him, but swallow and answer. 

**Alex:** I- I want to discredit it.

I don't know why I feel so scared at this moment. It's only a man wearing a hood, but his entire presence feels off. Like he doesn't belong in this car. I can feel his gaze shifting, turning to face Chris. 

**The Guide:** You want answers to the questions deep in your heart. You yearn for adventure, but most importantly, for family. 

Chris keeps his gaze locked on the road, unmoving, unbothered. 

**The Guide:** Is that why you intend to reach the end? 

**Chris:** Yes. 

I don't understand the exchange, but I have little time to think about it before the booming voice fills the car again. 

**The Guide:** Alexandra. I can tell you everything you want to know. All of it. I know more about you and your relatives than you do. I sense that you want to. 

I clenched my hands. The question burning in my head, my tongue itching to move. Chris remained locked on the road. 

An icy cold hand grabs my shoulder and presses so hard that I think it might break. All I can muster is a surprised gasp. 

**The Guide:** You don't know what you're heading into, even those that believe are foolish. You should turn around. You should ask the question.

I feel my mouth shaking, the breath stuck in my throat. I haven't blinked since he touched me and I find myself unable to move. His hand is so cold that it sends shivers down my spine. Then he lets go. 

**The Guide:** Very well.

Chris seems to calm down with those words, and to my big relief the car starts to slow down. 

We stop right outside of a forest. A forest I have never seen before, even though I live in the area. We surely haven't driven that far?

I hear the door open, but never close. I turn around, holding my breath. The seat is vacant, and oddly enough, the door is closed. I take a deep breath of relief, and look to Christopher. After a minute, he looks at me and smiles. 

**Chris:** You did well. 

**Alex:** Thank you.

I don't understand why I feel proud. I didn't ask a strange man any questions, and now I am shook? What am I scared of? 

**Chris:** You're still not convinced. 

**Alex:** He could just be a man. 

**Chris:** You think I set this up? It's alright, there is plenty of time left. 

We waited a while before Olly arrived, he looked shaken to his core when he sat in his car. I raise an eyebrow. 

**Alex:** Why can't we see The Guide?

**Chris:** He only shows himself in the car. You didn't notice that the car door only closed, and didn't open when he entered?

I had noticed that. And for some odd reason it made sense. But it was impossible, no man is invisible. 

Olly stepped out of the car, putting on a brave face. 

**Olly:** Damn! I did not expect that.

**Chris:** Better get used to it. 

The rest of the cars arrived at a steady interval. Each one looking shaken, but none worse than Olly. Mabel smiles at me and hugs her husband. Probably thinking the same as me. When everyone had arrived, Chris gathered us together for a brief before the day ends.

**Chris:** Good job everyone. We rest here for the night, then we head into the forest. One person stands guard at a time, the woods can be mean. Other than that, sleep well. 

We walked back to our cars, and I feel more tired than I ought to be. When we reached the car, Chris looked at me. 

**Chris:** Get some good sleep, alright? We have new challenges tomorrow.

**Alex:** Why do we need to keep watch tonight?

**Chris:** Hopefully you will never know. Welcome to The Driving Game, Alexandra Allen.
