Every living person can tell a story about something scary happening in their life where there were sure ghosts or monsters were out to get them. I encourage you to go to anyone and ask them about the scariest time in their life. I asked close friends and family about their stories and I heard plenty from, spooky ghost stories, to roller coaster rides, to horrible people doing unsavory things. I can’t help but envy them as most of their stories were lighthearted and were things such as animals but not me. I’ve been thinking of a way to tell someone this story without coming off as insane, as even the people closest to me don’t believe in it.

I even convinced myself it wasn’t real for some time. I went to therapy and got told I was some sort of schizophrenic and my brain was filling in blanks as some sort of trauma response. I found comfort in those moments, and ideas, that my brain made it all up. That was until last month when I brought my sister and dad to clean out an old storage unit I had been paying for since college. I was sick of paying for it and it was time for it all to go.

Memories shot back to me as all the things I’d been hoarding since childhood were discovered among them. But I froze when I came across a small wooden box with a lock on it. I knew immediately what was inside. I didn't bother finding the key as I smashed it to the ground revealing the only things that could convince me that I wasn’t insane. I stared at the items I lifted the broken watch once belonging to my friend and the photo of 5 naive young adults standing out of a log cabin. I couldn’t stop the tears from running down my cheeks. Now I come here to share my story.

This was 8 years ago in my college years, I was going for a degree in electrical engineering but you know how college is expensive. With the scholarships I had received my first year was free. But not the other 3 years, so my free time was spent working trying to save up money for the following years. No matter how much I worked it was never going to pay it all and I was forced to take out student loans. Summer was coming up and I came across an article for a research study. They were offering to pay 10k a month for people to stay in an old lodge for some shut-down summer camp. With an additional bonus if you could make it through the summer. Normally this would set some red flags in most people. But I was desperate and there's no way if I worked over the summer I’d ever come close to making that much. So I reached out to the group and they accepted I was sent a list of things that I should bring.

Plenty of clothes (All participants will only be able to wash clothes once every two weeks)

Typical camping gear, Lanterns, tents, sleeping bags, etc.

Nonperishables ( Food will be provided but it’s always nice to spice things up)

Knife or axes

Games to pass the time ( recommend games for multiple people)

Books

A canteen

I always enjoyed camping so I already had all the stuff. Camping with strangers sounded fun to me. Schools ended for the year and the research thing started in 9 days so I drove up to my dad's place to spend a week beforehand. My gear was there anyway so it made sense. Plus going there first would cut an hour off my 10-hour drive. My dad was happy to see me and my sister was acting bratty as always. I didn’t tell either of them the full details of where I was going, I thought they might call me stupid and try to talk me out of it. At the time I had the thought for a split second that this could be the last time I see them.

The drive up there was long and boring, almost 9 hours of silence as my radio in my car didn’t work. There was a town 30 minutes out from the summer camp so I figured I could stop there for the night to eat and rest. It was a small quaint place but there was a dinner and a motel so it was good for me. I stopped at the dinner and ordered a burger and it was surprisingly good. I had all day so I took my time and ate I asked my waitress if she knew where the camp was, maybe there was a shorter route to cut off some driving and she just said it was somewhere up north. I found it funny cause that’s what I told my family.

I spent the rest of my day in the motel and nothing exciting happened. The following morning started with the drive up to the lodge. It was around 45 minutes and I was just relieved I wouldn’t have to drive for a while. I was the last of everyone to arrive and I assumed the people doing the research study would meet us there but no luck. I did end up meeting the 5 lucky strangers I would get to spend the summer with. I decided to do small interviews with all of them just to see what they were like.

Lauren, 21, female, with blonde hair, blue eyes, caucasian, recently lost her job and is doing this for the money while she tries to find something else.



Hunter, 25. Male. brown hair, hazel eyes, caucasian, wanted to get away from his dad's farm for a bit.



Dakotah, 21, Male, Black hair, brown eyes, Native American, Figured this would be a good break and would help pay some of his debt.



Camila, 22, Female, Brown Hair, brown eyes, Latina, Just wanted the money.



Ava, 21, female, green hair, brown eyes, caucasian, wanted to get away and this seemed like a paid vacation.

The whole group seemed fine but right off the back, I could tell there was a split in the 2 groups. Hunter Camilia and I got along, while Lauren Dakotah and Ava gravitated toward each other. We began to think for a second we were at the wrong place or something. I tried reaching out to the researchers but there was no service. Everyone else had the same luck. Hunter just went into the cabin anyway despite our protest. But that was the right call as we found our first care package and a note. The care package had food, water, blankets, and a rifle with 30 rounds. It had the words for bears carved into the stock. 

“Look this is too many words anyone else wanna read it?” Hunter asked.

I took the note it read “**Hello patrons we at Milin Inc. are very excited that your group agreed to be part of our research study. Now all of you must read this note as it’s contaminants or of utmost importance. We are monitoring you and will not get in contact unless it is an emergency. Food and water will be provided once a week by an associate we ask you not to interact with this person as it may interfere with the study. All of you will be allowed to do 1 load of laundry every 2 weeks. The washer will not work any other time so do not try. The lodge does have central air so don’t worry about the weather. All of you are allowed to leave at any time do keep in mind you are paid by the month and will not get paid unless a full month is finished. Now the following should be reviewed multiple times by each person as the rules must be followed failure to follow the rules can end in unforeseen consequences.”** That brought a chill down my spine.” **1. Do not leave the lodge between the hours of 10 pm and 7 am a clock is provided with the exact time. 2. If you decide to leave you must leave between 7 am to 10 am. 3. Do not attempt to leave summer campgrounds unless it is to exit the research study. 4. Do not eat anything besides what you brought and what we provide. 5. If you see a man outside your window between 3 am and 5 am DO NOT INTERACT.”** “What the fuck” I said out loud.

“Keep reading,” Ava said.

**“6. Do not attempt to kill any wildlife unless in self-defense. 7. There is a locked door in the upper part of the lodge DO NOT ATTEMPT to open it. 8. If someone begins banging on the door between 12 am and 4 am DO NOT LET THEM IN. 9. Lock the main cabin door each night and make sure all windows are shut. 10. If you smell something sweet like peaches while outside immediately run and lock the cabin doors do not leave the cabin until the following morning. 11. They are not your friends, they don’t want to help you, so do not take anything from them. Once again review these rules among yourself several times.**

“That’s cryptic,” Dakotah said taking the note and rereading it.

“I'm sure all of it can be explained as part of their research study,” Hunter replied.

“The money to good I don’t care how scary shit gets I'm staying,” Camila said.

We spent the day getting to know each other. Lauren wanted all of us to spend the night outside but we reminded her of the note. She tried to fight us on it but gave in. Hunter and I locked the door and started checking the windows. There were plenty of rooms that each of us could have our own. I went upstairs to my room when I came across a door I tried opening it but it was locked. Shit did I break that rule I thought to myself. I wrote on a piece of paper to not attempt to open it then taped it to the door. 

My room was smaller than the others, and I took my first ounce of free time to unpack my bag and take stalk of what I brought, Clothes about 2 and a half weeks worth, a canteen, firestarter, knife, compass, sleeping bag, blankets, various canned foods, and handgun which I borrowed from my dad. I didn’t know what kinda people I’d be spending time with and I wanted to be safe. I didn’t have a bed, and none of the rooms did so I used my sleeping bag as a makeshift mattress. As first days go went off without a hitch.

After the first week that’s when things started to get weird. It began early in the morning. Hunter Ava and I went outside to play cards. All of us were getting sick of that cabin. But we noticed Hunter's truck had been broken into. All of his valuables were inside and nothing looked damaged, It was chalked up to animals, but surely animals would leave a sign of some sort. A ton of rustling came from the bushes we had the rifle and while I was concealing I also had my handgun just in case anything came at us. The first food drop came that day as well. Several of us had to try not to talk to the guy delivering as per instructions. He was odd though wearing some sort of tactical gear and he looked lifeless, he walked kinda slumped and didn't even seem to realize we were around. 

That night was the first time we came in contact with one of them. Night fell and we went about the night as checking the doors and windows.  I was struggling to sleep that night so I was up playing solitaire to pass the time. I didn’t even know how to play when I came here but now it was my main pastime. Around 2 am hit and \*bang bang bang bang bang\*. I walked out of my room to check on it and everyone was out of their room already. Hunter was already holding the rifle downstairs. The banging continued whatever it was hit the door hard enough to see it from upstairs. Then it started talking the voice sounded like a man but was super raspy like he had something in his throat.

“Hello, hello, HELLO, I know someone in there I see the lights” I motioned to everyone to cut their lights “I need your help I'm hurt, yeah I’m hurt, you have to help. Why are you ignoring me I know you're there. LISTEN YOU FUCKS OPEN THE DOOR NOW. If you don't open really things are gonna happen.”

Hunter made his way for the door I made a noise and he turned around, I mouthed the rules and he started to back away. The banging continued for a couple more minutes. When we were all sure it stopped we made our way back to the rooms. When the following morning came around you tell by their eyes no one got much sleep that night. When any of us tried to mention it no answers ever came. It was like everyone was trying to pretend it didn’t happen.

4 more days passed without any incident and we were finally able to wash our clothes. The washer was outside in a smaller shed by the lodge and we chose to draw straws to see who went first. Well, I was last in line. When it finally came to my turn I made my way for the lodge. It was already 4 pm. I loaded the washer and turned around. But it wasn’t what it should have been it was pitch black outside and somehow my clothes were finished I was brought inside, and I was met with Dakotah asking if I needed some alone time. That added to my already confused head and when I looked at the time it was 9:45 pm. I sat there that night wondering if I had somehow zoned out for hours. I was snapped out of it by the same banging from nights passed.

I looked out into the main room to see if anyone was out there it seemed they ignored it. So I followed suit and back to my room. 2 more weeks passed and we heard the banging a few more times almost starting to get used to it. We followed all the rules we were all particular about it until. Well, Ava began butting heads with the whole group over petty things. One day she decided she had enough and was going to leave. We reminded her that she wasn’t supposed to leave today as the designated time had passed. But she didn’t care and drove off. Well, no one thought much of it until about 10 minutes later when she came driving back in. I welcomed her back and she muttered about getting turned around before driving off again. Well again 10 minutes later she was back. She repeated this 4 more times, she began screaming there was no exit and she just kept coming back here.

Dakotah got in his car to lead her out but 10 minutes later they both returned. They were both sure of themselves that there was no exit and Hunter and I got in his truck to go check it out but we shortly found ourselves right back. Everyone else chimed in and everyone else always ended up back there. We spent the rest of the day trying to leave only to return. Everyone seemed to be going insane as we returned to the cabin that night. When we got there we found another note in the same place our first one was, I picked it up.

 **“ We warned you to follow the rules, we urged you. We explained there would be consequences if you didn’t. Now you see those consequences. No one will be allowed to leave until the end of the summer. That is your fault as you should have listened and now you are stuck. Now reread the rule as you don’t want any further consequences. Tonight they will visit lock yourselves in your room and do not come out for any reason. They want to keep you here and they will do anything to do so. The rules are for your safety. We hope in the future you will listen.”**

Everyone made their way to their rooms as what else were we to do? I heard the front door open, every room was locked but I still put stuff in front of the door in case. I placed my ear to the wall trying to hear the other side. I heard multiple sets of footsteps making their way up the stairs. I clutched my gun hoping they weren’t making their way to my room. They didn’t, they went away to find my room. I knew right where they were going. She must have locked it but the door opened anyway. Then came Ava’s scream, blood-curdling, begging for help, but none of us did. She screamed as they dragged her from her room. I looked out my window and I saw what had her. People, not normal people, wore rags of clothing and had no emotions on their faces. They dragged Ava across the ground now matter how hard she fought they dragged her with no effort. I locked eyes with her right before she was pulled into the woods. Seconds after she was out of sight the screaming stopped.

The following day was full of discourse. The first thing I did when I woke up was go to Ava's room. It had been torn apart and the lock to the door had been broken. Everyone was tense and Dakotah and Lauren stayed distant from the rest of us. 

“The fuck do we do man, I mean they took her so easily, none of us even tried to help,” Hunter said. 

“I don’t have any answers,” I replied.

“Who in the hell are we working for I mean they have powers or something and they know what’s going on with those things,” Camellia added.

“We have to follow the rules, that’s all we can do.”

When night finally did come we decided it be better to share rooms. So Hunter Camilia and I shared our room. Somehow the two of them were able to sleep. Not me I spent the whole night staring at the man standing in the window. I didn’t interact I didn’t acknowledge him I just stared until he gave up and left. Half the summer had passed and everything became routine, the banging, the nighttime check, and the men. We saw Dakotah and Lauren from time to time but we never interacted. Dakotah stood on the porch and I just walked past. The man who brought our food came to drop it off and Daoath unprovoked grabbed him.

He started screaming at him demanding they let him go and Lauren egged him on. I knew this would cause problems so I started running towards him. Hunter made it there before me and tackled him.

“Are you trying to get us killed you sack of shit?”

The man ran to the woods.

“Oh fuck you Hunter I’m the only one doing anything.”

They looked at each other while the rest of us watched. But then Camilia pointed out it wasn’t day anymore no there was no light in the sky and somehow no one noticed. Hunter Stopped to check his watch now cracked.

“It’s 10:11 EVERYONE GET TO THE LODGE!”

We all rushed to the door but it was locked. Everyone somehow without realizing it broke another rule which meant they were coming. You could smell peaches in the air. They were quick already leaving the woods. Walking slowly towards us. I ran to the shed with the washing machine and they all followed. As we landed at it Camilia was the last to come. But before she made it they grabbed her. Hunter and I tried to fight for control over Hunter even shot one of them but they were too strong. We shut the door trying to barricade it off with what little we could. We heard her scream as they dragged her away. Dakotah stepped toward a window and they grabbed him. Once we tried to fight for him but no luck as they took him as well. 

The rest of the night was spent hiding in the shed. But eventually, morning came, and the remaining three of us left. Hunter set the rifle on the side of the lodge and sat on the steps to the porch. He placed his head in his hands and whispered to himself. I tried to comfort him but I heard the rifle load another round. We both looked as Lauren aimed the rifle at us.

“Wow, Lauren what are you doing?” I asked she didn’t answer.

“Lauren put it down let's talk,” Hunter said.

“Oh fuck off Hunter I’m sick of this I know you're involved in this let me go,” Lauren said.

“What are you talking about,” I asked.

“Think about how he’s also first when something goes wrong, he’s magically okay after last night. Me Dakotah thought something was wrong so that’s why we harassed the food guy and he was first to defend him, think he has to be involved.”

“Why in the hell would I be involved in any of this, I mean that sou…”

His sentence was cut off by a loud bang, Hunter gripped his chest and fell to the ground. I put my hand on the wound trying to stop the bleeding. If only I hadn’t left my gun inside maybe I could've done more.

“The ammo in his pocket give it to me.” I did “ You stay here if you move I’ll kill you too.”

I stayed there trying still trying to stop the bleeding. A couple minutes later she came out of the lodge with her bag before she walked off into the woods. I didn’t see her again. I buried Hunter that day and at least it passed the time. I didn’t even cry I felt nothing while doing it. I took his watch to help with my time management. I wasn’t willing to go off into the woods after her. I didn’t know if they’d come back for me that night. So I waited for something but they never came.

I spent the rest of the summer alone following the rule, dealing with the men at night. After everyone was gone though they came less maybe once a week now. I didn’t realize the summer was over until the day when I went outside there was a very small care package. It had three things. A picture of all of us it was the one taken on our first day I didn’t even remember who took it. I cried over it. The second thing was a small note congratulating me for finishing. The third is the check for completing it all.

I dropped out of college and gave the money to my dad. I got a job at the post office and that’s what I’ve been doing since. But the other day I quit my job. Took what money I had and bought supplies. Now I’m sitting in the same diner I had all the years ago, eating out for probably the last time. I have to go back and I don’t even know why. I know I’m not crazy now I know it all happened. But I still have to prove it to myself. I convinced a friend from college who had nothing to lose to come with me he just wanted to know if the stories were true. We're heading out where you might ask just somewhere up north.
