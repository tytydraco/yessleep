Okay, I’m not even sure where to start but my hands are shaking as I am writing this and I am terrified.

About a year ago, I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep, when I heard a tapping sound coming from my window. My bed is right next to the window so it was loud and a very clear tapping sound. At first, I tried to ignore it, making myself believe it was just a branch from the tree outside, but the tapping persisted. I sat up in bed and listened carefully, my heart racing.

The tapping became louder and more persistent, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was outside, trying to get my attention. I slowly made my way to the window and peered out, but I couldn’t see anything in the darkness. I closed the curtains tightly and went back to bed, but the tapping continued.

I still kept telling myself it was just the wind, but the sound was too rhythmic and deliberate.  There was someone, or something, outside. I reached for my phone to call the police, but before I could dial, the tapping suddenly stopped. 

I went back to bed, listening for any sound for hours, but all was silent. I eventually fell into a fitful sleep but was awoken several times throughout the night by the tapping. I was too afraid to look or even open my eyes at all…

That next morning, I went outside to check the window, and there was no sign of damage or anything out of the ordinary. The tapping did not return, but I knew that something sinister had been at my window that night…

As I said, this happened like a year ago, and last night I heard it again. The tapping at my window, just as loud and persistent as it was before. I was paralysed with fear, not knowing what to do. I actually mustered up the courage to get out of bed and go to the window. I cautiously pulled back the curtains with my heart pounding in my chest. 

There it was, a figure standing outside my window, smiling at me eerily. The smile stretched unnaturally wide across its face and it just stood there, still tapping its finger on my window.

I stumbled back from the window in terror, tripping over my own feet. I scrambled to my feet, heart racing, and ran to my bathroom. I stayed there the whole night. I was on the phone with my brother for a while who tried to calm me down and obviously thought I was making shit up, but it made me feel safe. After about four hours the sun started to rise and I gathered the courage to open my bathroom door. I was facing the window with the curtains still opened, no sign of the figure. 

I am left with no explanation for what I saw. What was this and what does it want? No one believes me and I am terrified. It’s getting dark again now and I don’t know if the figure will be out there tonight, waiting for me, or if he will reappear a year from now again… I will keep you updated.
