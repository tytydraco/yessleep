**6/9/2025**

Ever since I first began at my current job, there’s been something off about Michael. 

He’s not right. He’s never been right. His unexplainable *wrongness* sits somewhere in the crease of his eyebrow, beneath his yellowing fingernails, the dip in his tongue when he laughs, and it simmers, it boils and radiates off him in coils of steam and mist. 

It first gripped me on my second day. Michael has his own office - it’s a closed off little area, but without privacy. The ‘walls’ are sheets of thick glass, and he sits facing the rest of us in our closed-off cubicles. He just sits there, and his monitors are just the right height to peer over the screens with his beady eyes and watch and watch. He’s always typing, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen him look at the keyboard. 

I don’t know what Michael does for work. I’ve asked just about everyone here, who all seem pretty normal for the most part, and they’ve all said something about logistics, but I don’t know what makes him so important he gets his own office. It’s not that he needs it, either. No one ever goes to him for meetings, and he certainly doesn’t need any sort of noise-proofing. I wonder, sometimes, if he does anything at all. If his monitors face away from us to hide that nothing is ever done with them. Maybe, I once reasoned, it was some sort of money-laundering thing, a fake employee who gets paid minimum wage to do nothing while the big boss pockets an extra manager's salary. That idea was stomped out when Jake From Finance showed me all the actual fake employees for money laundering, and they’re not even real, so why waste £25,000 a year on bloody Manager Michael? I also asked Jake From Finance if he could make an employee called Fergus Knife, but apparently that would make us suspicious. As if Michael isn’t the most suspicious bloke around.

So, he’s been like this for three years now: a mystery. And I don’t even like mysteries that much. But I don’t like my job significantly more than I don’t like mysteries, so I may as well put my energy into figuring out Michael rather than accounting for a company that surely isn’t meeting their employee competence quota anyway, considering the vast number of workers that legitimately do not exist, and the therefore vast number of working hours completely unaccounted for. So this brings me to you: here, I will document Micheal and the weird things he does with some commentary! Lucky you. I doubt this will go anywhere, as we probably all know a Michael, so if I never update, It’s because I’m crazy and Michael was normal the whole time. But I will update. Because Micheal is *not normal* I swear to God. 

**7/9/25 - Michael, Entry one:**

**7:45**

I arrive at work 15m early, hoping to catch Michael sleeping at his desk with his eyes open. Michael is not there and I get bored.



**7:57**

I go to the bathroom, Michael is still not there.



**8:00**

I leave the bathroom. Michael is at his desk. Michael seems to have made himself a coffee from the breakroom machine. Circa five minutes per coffee. How was that so fast, Michael?



**9:45**

Micheael wasn’t doing anything, so I speedrun making myself a coffee from the breakroom machine. There and back, four minutes 28 seconds, timed. *How was that so fast, Michael?*



**9:52**

I got bored again, and decided to approach Michael. As I walk up to his window/door, he doesn’t make eye contact with me at all, or even try to express some sort of recognition. He’s still watching, though, eyes razor focused somewhere in the distance from over his computer. It takes three knocks for him to spring into action. 



He stands up to greet me, pushing open the swinging door and gesturing with one suited arm to invite me in. It’s the kind of greeting that should be paired with a smile, but Michael doesn’t smile. He laughs, but he doesn’t smile. 



It’s silent for too long, and when Michael finally speaks, he only says “yes?”, like I had just asked a question. 



“Hi, Michael. I was just going to make myself another coffee. Would you like one as well?”



I expected this to confuse him, and in part, I wanted to. I wanted to see him show any kind of understanding of regular customs. 



“You had a coffee recently.”



Right. Dim of me to think he wasn't survailling my every move. 



“I’m going to have another one.”



Michael nods. “Yes.”



“Sorry?”



“It’s okay.”



“No, like, pardon?”



Michael nods again, like put on repeat. “Yes, I would like another coffee.”



“Alright. How do you like your coffees, Michael?”



“Normal.”



“Sorry?”



“Sorry like pardon?”



“Yes.”



“Okay, I would like it with milk.”



I nod like a therapist. “Right. So, a flat white? Cappuccino?”



“Two.”



“You want a cappuccino?”



“What is that?” Michael tilts his head to one side.



I sigh. “I’m just going to make you a flat white, okay?”



“Yes, very good.”



“Thanks, Michael. I’ll be back soon.”

  


**9:55**



I make Michael a long black. 

  


**10:00**



When I give Michael his coffee, he takes one (1) sip.



“Is it good?”



“Yes, I appreciate it.” What an odd bloke. 



I just nod, and as I go to leave, I maneuver around his office unnecessarily, and crane my neck to peer over Michael’s shoulder at his monitor screen. He’s already facing away from me, back ram-rod straight and staring into nothingness.

On his screen though, is more interesting than anything he might find outside of his office. 



**10:01**



I’m still not sure what I expected to see on his screen. The home screen to a search engine. Bland emails with nothing to them. Maybe even some obscure logistics dashboard with cryptic acronyms and no clear reason.



Instead, I see a still image. It’s monochrome, grainy, like it’s from a CCTV feed or pulled off an old VHS tape.



It’s my desk. 



My too small cubicle, just off-center, as if the camera had been placed somewhere beneath the overhead light. I can see my water bottle, a half-eaten protein bar I forgot to throw out, the coffee from fifteen minutes ago, still faintly steaming. I don’t remember seeing a camera.



I blink. When I look again, it's from a different angle, higher up now, and it's harder to make out with the low quality. The timestamp changes, 10:00:57. There’s a blur in the frame, a figure, paused mid-step.



It’s me. My hand is halfway in my pocket. I remember doing that, fishing for my phone. 



And then it jumps out at me, an awful, fizzing pot of nausea and confusion and bone-deep terror. The footage is a minute old, and it’s not an old recording. It’s just delayed. 



Michael starts typing. 



I snap my head to him, eyes jumping up faster than the rest of me. Michael is still facing forward, staring at the glass wall. His reflection stares back at him, fingers the only part of him that are moving.

“You are feeling good?”

The hairs on my neck rise, cold sweat dripping down my back. I step backward toward the door, eyes on Michael’s, in the window. Michael’s eyes on his own. 

“Yeah. Just making sure you’re enjoying the coffee.”

He doesn’t respond.

I leave the room.



**10:03**

Back at my desk, I check the ceiling. There’s no camera there. I open my laptop.

My webcam light is on.

Forget what I said before. I will be updating this. There is definitely something wrong with Michael.



**8/9/2025**

Okay, it’s 7:30 right now, and I’m hoping to get to work before Michael today. I’m not making the mistake of looking away from his desk for even a moment. I need to know how he got there so quickly last time. Then, I had given him the benefit of the doubt, but his weirdness is no longer something up for debate. I’m starting to wonder now whether I should tell my co-workers - I know for a fact, despite all my narcissism, that I am not the only one Michael is watching. Will they believe me though? Probably not. Do I risk it anyway?

I guess that’s something to worry about later. I’m going to head off now, but I’ll give you live updates. Well, for me they’re live.

**8/9/25 - Michael: Entry two**

**7:54**

Arrived a bit later than hoped (got tempted by a Greggs - sausage roll is bomb btw) but still here before Michael. I’m quite surprised he doesn’t just live here. It’s somehow more jarring that he goes somewhere else. Does he have a family? A landlord? Does he have friends? I can’t imagine any of the three. The fact Michael can vote is astounding to me. 

Whatever, I’m just going to wait for him to rock up. He’ll probably levitate up the building instead of taking the lift.



**7:59**

One minute. Ooooh, this is so exciting guys!



**8:00**

I blinked. 

I swear to you, I blinked, and Michael was at his desk. No coffee this time. Maybe the machine is broken in hell, or wherever he comes from. I don’t know what just happened, but I’m positive that man did not walk there. 



**8:02**

I turn to Priya, ask her about Michael getting here so quickly. She just says that she “never notices him, anyway.” “couldn’t possibly” tell me the “exact time he gets here each day.” I really don’t like that she makes me sound like a stalker when Michael legitimately has live CCTV footage of my desk at all times. Probably hers, too. I don’t tell her that out of spite.

As far as I know, the footage is silent. He doesn’t wear any sort of ear piece (the thought of Michael wearing airpods is hilarious) and when I was there, his office was as silent as it could be. Maybe I should be careful anyway though. 



**8:45**

Michael still hasn’t moved. He’s blinked a couple of times, and I’m probably looking into it too much, but it’s almost like something he does on purpose, not because he needs to. It’s hardly the worst accusation to make of him, though, considering everything. He’s worse than watching paint dry. I decided to talk to Jake From Finance.



**8:48**

Overheard Jake From Finance discussing confidential information. Will update.



**8:50**

I just convinced Jake From Finance to help me gain access to confidential information! 

Top bloke, he is. Apparently the finance guys all know about these weird misfiled documents tucked in with the stocks dataset or something. They probably just threw them at the most chronically uncurious people to ever exist. Jake From Finance tells me he “just never thought about looking at them”, but they’re on his computer as *The Files of Death.* He spells it as ‘fiels.’



**8:53**

Jake From Finance is getting us through a firewall. He says it’s not a firewall and that “they don’t work that way”, but I don’t care. Apparently, he went to uni for computer science. I will once again remind you that he can’t spell the word ‘files’.



**9:01**

We’re in. That’s what Jake From Finance said when a long list of digital folders appeared lined up neatly in a backlog. “We're in”, like he’s the pro-hacker tomboy daughter of a mechanic with a strip of purple in her hair that impresses the main character in a coming of age movie because she knows how to change a tire. 

“What do you think is actually in here?” I ask.

“Probably something to do with all the money laundering we do.”

I nod. “You reckon anything interesting?”

“May as well find out.”

Jiff (That’s his name now, Jake From Finance is mad long and JFF sounds too much like JFK), clicks on the first folder that popped up, and double clicks one of the many yellow files. 

When the folder loads, it’s full of images. Jiff scrolls and scrolls and there are so many they blur into each other, one big grey pixelated sludge. 

Jiff scrunches his nose. “This is pretty weird.”

“Is it?” I furrow my brow. It’s just pictures. 

“Yeah. It’s just full of PDFs. Usually, written documents wouldn’t be in folders as PDFs, but more likely in a shared drive, or doc or something. These are like, old.”

“The titles say they’re only from a few years ago?”

Jiff shakes his head. “No, look at them, they’ve been scanned. They look like they’re from ages ago. At least, long enough ago that documents were physically typed out with typewriters.”

“Cool. Can we see one?”

Jiff clicks on one at random, INDEX/VEILPROTOCOL, his eyes scanning the screen while it loads. The look on his face worries me - it’s like this isn’t something he sees a lot. For a moment, I wonder if I want to back out. If I even want to know what’s in here if it’s anything to do with whatever is going on with Micheal.

The PDF loads before I have the chance to look away.

All Jake can do is stare. It’s all I can do, either. The screen is too bright and the words feel so close to my face they burn my retinas. I turn to Jake.

“What is this?”

“I don’t know.”

“What does it mean?”

“I don’t know.”

“Is this real?”

He pauses. “I don’t know.”

I breathe in, breath catching in my throat, pulse beating loudly and blood pulsing in my ears. “We need to look at another one.”

“No.”

I glare at him. “No?”

“We can’t. I need a drink.”

Jake slams his computer shut, too hard. His face is as blank as Micheal’s. It scares me. 

I don’t follow him.



**9:20**

The office is suffocatingly normal. A reminder that no one else felt the way I just did. No one else feels ruined forever. A joke. It must be that. A joke. 

The other secrets it’s tucked text to aren’t a joke though. The financial crime, the laundering. I purposefully don’t think about that. 

When I sit back at my desk, Priya isn’t there. She’s my only friend here, unless we count Jake, I guess. But she felt so normal, where he just seemed like somebody who could easily become a Michael. Priya’s desk isn’t hers, though. Somebody else is there. Somebody else’s photos on the desk, somebody else's stickers on the borders of their computer screen. 

I ask HR where Priya went. Maybe, in those 30 minutes I was gone, she’d gotten a promotion and moved seven years of work from a 1.5m\^2 desk and taken the lift up a floor.

But they just look at me with a mix between confusion and pity, and say with such conviction, that Priya Das doesn’t work here, and never has.



**16:04**

I’m heading home now. Technically, I still have an hour left to get my hours in this week, but nobody’s going to notice. If they do, they won’t care. 

It’s dark outside now, and the walls of Michael’s office are reflecting the lights of London below, smears of warm yellow and cool blue streaked over the glass.

As I write this, I’m watching Michael as he stares into nothing. I can’t find his reflection. 



**18:24**

I just got back from the gym. I ran until I couldn’t anymore. There’s an email in my inbox from Jake, and the subject line is just “There are more.”

I need a shower, and I need to eat something. I’ll show you when I open the email, if I open the email.



**19:05**

As promised:

I don’t know what to do. 



**9/8/2025**

**7:05**

I didn’t sleep last night. It’s not like I didn’t want to. I wasn’t up late thinking about Michael or work or Jake or Priya, I was doing everything but. Keeping my mind off it. It wasn't working, of course, but both my mind and body were exhausted and needed sleep and it just wouldn’t come. 

I’m beginning to miss Priya. I never realised how much I liked her until she was gone. Is she gone? Can somebody who was never there be gone?

Was Priya ever there?

The more I think about it, the more I remember Lucy. She sits where Priya sat. Apparently, that’s where she always sat. I remember her being there, too. She went to my 28th birthday earlier this year. She got me a candle, and it’s on my bedside table.

Priya was there too, though. And she got me a tie with flowers on it, and a card nicer than I had expected from her. I still have the tie, but I can’t find the card.

One time, Priya left work early, but she went to the bathroom first, and on the way out, I saw her mascara streaming down her face like a pitch black waterfall. She was on the phone, and the voice on the other side was louder than her soft sobs. Everyone heard, I’m sure, but their pitiful looks weren’t going to be enough. 

I followed her outside, and when I stepped onto the pavement, I saw Priya, pleading with somebody through the window of a sleek red car, shaking in the sharp cold of winter. Her arms were bare, save for where somebody’s hand was clasped around her bicep, far too tightly. The other arm had bruises that weren’t there minutes before. The man inside was talking quietly, but it was scarier than when he was yelling over the phone. I recognised him from the photos on her desk - her, him, and two beautiful children. Very young. Too young to understand what it means to have a dad that talks to your mum like this one did. 

I remember, I pretended to call the police. Spoke loud enough for both of them to hear it. “There’s a woman on Downing street in trouble. She’s hurt and in danger.”

I rattled off the number plate as he drove off, anger blazing in his eyes. I remember worrying I’d made it worse for her. I paid for her taxi, and she didn’t say anything until she left, when she shook my hand and said “thank you” so sincerely I had to clench my jaw so as not to cry. A week later, when I walked in to work, Priya had changed the photos on her desk, and now they only showed a family of three.

Something like that, I don’t think I could ever have made up. Someone as complex and as real as Priya couldn’t have come from me, it’s a disservice to her. 

I only hope that if she’s gone, she took her children, and that man, with her into non-existence. I hope that her children are not left with only one man to raise them. 

For Priya, I’ve decided I’m going to figure this out before it becomes more than what it is. Whether or not it will bring her back, it can’t happen to anyone else. It can’t happen to Jake. It can’t happen to me. 



**8:15**

I just got here. I’m late, but the receptionist didn’t say anything about it. I don’t think he would have noticed if I’d spontaneously combusted in front of him. Maybe he’s a Michael. I’ve decided I’m going to go find Jake From Finance and gaslight him into looking further into this whole incomprehensible horror thing.



**8:22**

Good news! Jiff didn’t need any gaslighting, he was down anyway. He’s throwing up in the bathroom right now due to stress and it’s my turn once he’s done, but after that we’re going for a coffee and looking through the weird little files. I’ll get him to send them to me, and I’ll do a little copy-paste motive in here.



**8:40**

Just thought of a joke - Michael heard someone say “here’s your work monitor” and he took that literally. Not good enough to say out loud but good enough to go in here.



**10:30**

Oops sorry I’m late I forgot! It’s all the same to you though. I’ve been back for about 30m, and nothing weird has happened since then. I think I’m becoming conditioned to the strangeness of this place. Or maybe I’m in shock. Nothing is really affecting me the way it should be, but I’m waiting for the pin to drop, the moment I go crazy. I’ll paste the documents below.

Pretty weird stuff. We noticed though, that even when all these are addressed to a great number of employees, there are very few with, or who had in the past, access to them. I wonder if me and Micheal even work at the same place. I wonder if I actually work anywhere at all. 



**10:58**

Just got back from the bathroom, and something weird has happened. Shock.

There’s something on my computer. It’s just an off-white screen, like old paper, and black text sprawling across the middle. It’s not text, actually. It’s just symbols. 

\[photo attached\]

⧗⚚⦽\_⚏⚚\_ ᚘ⚚⦻\_⍌⚚⫽⍙\_⫷⋇⫽⋇

I don’t know what it means. I don’t know if it means anything. I don’t know if I care. 



**19:47**

I’m breaking into Michael’s office.

Honestly, it’s getting ridiculous. It’s been three days and I’m losing my bloody mind. Three days, and I’ve witnessed Michael stalking me, we’ve uncovered a bureaucratic horror, a colleague has transcended into the abyss by osmosis or something. So I am breaking into Michael’s office.

It’s really not hard. I only have to gently push the door.

I don’t know when he left. I was probably playing Candy Crush or something. Jiff says he doesn’t want to break in with me but I know he’s gonna get FOMO and do it anyway, so I guess I’ll just wait until he changes his mind.



**19:50**

Jiff has changed his mind! 



**20:40**

We just broke into Michael’s office.

# I know, with absolute certainty, that he was not there. Not from the outside, at least. His chair was tucked in all neat, monitor shut down and screen black and shiny. Micheal was not in his office.

Except that he was.

We pushed open the door, and Michael was there, more real than he’d ever been to me, more real than he’d possibly ever been. Completely wild.

Inside the office, it was windy. And so, so cold. The painful kind that bites at you and creeps under jumpers and scarves, wraps around and suffocates you through your clothing. 

Michael was at his desk, and he was typing. 

Not words, symbols, ones I recognised from my own monitor just hours before, and faces, colours, sounds. The monitor flickered as the office warped. Colours so bright they hurt to look at, faces of every emotion, of all of them at once, but each so intense they couldn’t have meant anything but hate. Michael was still, stiff as a board, like taxidermy. But he was alive, so much so that who he seemed to be before couldn’t have been something living at all. 

His face mirrored those on screen. Ecstatic joy, desperate sadness, terrified anger, flashing one after the over so fast one was indistinguishable from the other. The only constant was his eyes, black as coal, two shiny pebbles pushed into skin and bone, boring into their own reflection. His eyes never closed.

Paper flew through the air so quickly each sheet became streaks of pure white, and sharp enough to slice through skin. Pens, paperweights, cupholders, carried on the wind but moving on their own, as if chasing each other. The room was, in its entirety, in control. Colours flashed across my eyes, from the monitor, from Michael, from my own mind, I wasn’t sure. But through all the noise of the office, the blood pulsing in my ears, the howling wind and clatter of supplies thrashing across the room, Micheae’s whispers were louder. 

It was like chanting, it was in reverence. The softest, breathiest rasp of words rising from the ground like smoke, shaking the floor and resting in my chest like a heavy bass. So quiet, but the loudest thing I had ever heard. 

What he said, I can’t understand. Every word, every language, every tone of voice. But loudest of all, laced with hate and kindness, disgust and worship:



**You do not work here.** 



And then, I was alone. Jake left, or maybe he was never there, and the absence of another person weighed on me like a conscience. I was alone. Or, maybe the problem was that I wasn’t alone at all.

Because it wasn’t just me and Michael in the office. I wasn’t sure that Michael had ever been just one person. I wasn’t sure that Michael had been a person at all since I’d known him. And with all that he’d tried to become something uninteresting, he was the least human thing I’d ever seen.

What colour was his hair again? I couldn’t remember. Maybe I had never known. The only thing I could remember was those eyes. Those black pebble eyes that never seemed to look at anything. But a face? Did he ever have one?

But he must have. He must have had a face, because I had seen it morph into hatred and love and sadness and confusion like wet clay, thick but fluid like sticky molasses, melted butter. Maybe all Michael had ever been was a reflection. 

Of what, I wasn’t sure. I’m still not sure. But it’s not something from his office. Michael’s office is from it - whatever it is. And It’s been here longer than anyone else has. There’s something in Michael, a parasite that feeds, embedded in code. In the code of the computers, in the genetic code of the mind. 

You need to listen to me. It’s in the code.



**23:30**



I’m back at home now.

I haven’t tried speaking to Jake. I don’t know if Jake was ever with me today. I hope he wasn’t. I hope he didn’t go through that alone, as well. 

I wonder, is he with Priya? Will somebody else be in his cubicle tomorrow? Will I be in mine?

Because that’s just the thing, isn’t it? Micheal was just like me, once. Before he got the emails. Before he became ‘Authorised Personnel’, however many of them there are. 

And I’ve left his office, but his office hasn’t left me, and there’s not a single screen in my apartment that isn’t lit up a blazing white, symbols of crisp black cutting through the centre.
