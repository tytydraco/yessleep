To be honest I don’t know how to start this and i probably sound insane.

FYI: I live alone. I live in a small 2 story apartment . No roommates. No pets. Nobody has a spare key.

Last night, I got home from work around 6 PM, checked my mailbox like I always do. Bills, a takeout menu, and a small padded yellow envelope, the kind you’d get cheap electronics in. No return address. Just my name. Handwritten in smudged black ink. I thought maybe someone ordered something for me. My birthday was last week, so… I don’t know. I opened it without thinking.

Inside was a plain black thumb drive. No label. No logo. Just cold plastic.

I wasnt just going to plug this unknown thumb drive into my computer for someone to hijack all my files.

So i went to the public library,  Turned on the computer, and then 
I plugged **it** in.

I don’t know why. Something about it felt… personal. Intentional, Like it knew i was watching, that i was there..

The drive had one file.

“APR-26-2025_03-12-AM.mp4”

I hesitated.

Opened it.

The video was black and white, low resolution, grainy as hell. Looked like security footage. Night vision. At first I couldn’t tell what I was looking at. The frame was still. Silent.

Then I saw myself.

In bed.

Asleep.

Same blankets. Same pillowcase. Same tear in the corner of the curtain behind me. It was my room. My body. Completely still, except for the slow rise and fall of breathing.

The timestamp rolled forward.

3:12 AM to 3:41 - nothing. Just the sound of low static. I almost closed it.

Then, at 3:42:16 AM, something entered the frame.

It came from the bottom corner, crawling on hands and knees. The movement was off. Disjointed. Its limbs bent the wrong way, like it had too many joints. Long, pale arms. Fingers like roots. Its head was low, tucked unnaturally beneath its shoulders.

It crept toward the bed.

Towards me.

I couldn’t breathe. I wanted to pause the video, to close it, but I couldn’t make my hand move. I just stared.

At 3:43:50, it stopped next to my bed. It didn’t move. Just knelt there, inches from my face.

Watching.

At 3:47, it lifted a hand — slowly, slowly — and reached toward my face.

Then the screen cut to black.

The video ended.

No sound. No outro. Just darkness.

I yanked the USB out of my laptop and threw it across the room.

I didn’t sleep.

I sat on the couch until sunrise with every light in the apartment on, a kitchen knife in my lap, the front door double-locked, the bathroom door propped open so I could see inside from where I sat.

No noise. Nothing.

This morning, I tried to convince myself it was fake. A sick joke. Deepfake, maybe. Some kind of prank. I texted every friend I could think of.

No one admitted to anything.

Then I went to work.

When I came back this evening

There was another envelope.

Same kind. Same shaky handwriting.

Inside: a second thumb drive.

This one labeled: “APR-27-2025_03-48-AM.mp4”

I haven’t watched it yet.

But something’s wrong with my bedroom.

The blanket is folded differently. My pillow’s been flipped. There’s a smear of something dark on the wall by the bed, like an old handprint.

I don’t know what’s on this new video.

But I think it came back.

And this time, I don’t think it just watched me.

I can feel its presence.
I can feel it smiling in the mirror instead of me.
