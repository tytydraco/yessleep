Five months ago I moved out of my parents house after graduating from university. The offer I got for my current job came late and because of that I had little to no time to find somewhere to live. Everything was extremely out of my budget and my starting salary couldn’t accommodate anything but a small hole in the wall – exactly what I ended up getting. 



I never thought living alone would be so ... lonely. Like most people, I had a handful of eccentric roommates to get me through my studies but a studio apartment can only accommodate so many things, two beds not being one of them. So every night when I came home from work I would be greeted with the eerie stillness of a dark room and cold sheets. I would cook up a depressing meal consisting of whatever ingredients I had left. Most of the time it was spaghetti. 



On my fifth day of working, I suppose news had spread through the small apartment complex that everyone had a new neighbour. Just as I closed my door and flipped on the light switch, a knock startled me out of my wits and caused me to drop my backpack on the floor, the contents spilling everywhere. I had turned around and seen through the peephole the one friendly face of a smiling older lady. Her hand was poised to rap again on the door when I opened it cautiously and greeted her. 



“Hello?” she had said quickly, though her eyes were closed and she held a white cane with a tennis ball on the end in her withered hands, “My name is Barbara. I live next door.”



“Harper,” I replied with a nervous chuckle, “You don’t know how bad that scared me. I wasn’t expecting a knock.”

  
“Are you having a hard time adjusting?” She inquired.

  
“You could say.”



Suddenly, she reached a hand to my face and touched my cheeks. “My, you’re so thin . . . I bet you don’t even have time to cook your own meals.”



The next night I received a cooked meal and from then on, another almost every evening. If I came home late, it would be left on the doormat with a small, endearing sticker. Usually, the top would be wrapped in tinfoil which I would have to peel back to uncover what was within. Today it happened to be an oven-baked pizza. I smiled to myself heartily. I felt a little less alone that night while I turned on my laptop and got to enjoy a bit more time relaxing than I usually did. 



However, that night I woke up to an odd scratching on my wall. My bed was pushed right beside Barbara’s apartment and so I could sometimes faintly hear her TV or some kind of music that she listened to. That was the first time I heard some kind of meowing, too. Not just one mew but a couple at once. Then an even fainter hushing and they all went quiet. I thought nothing of it, being so late and having to wake up so early, so I ignored it. Many times.



When I left my house the following Monday, I heard something akin to a wet slapping in Barbara’s apartment. Pushing apart the worst thoughts, I rationalized that she was maybe pounding pork or making some kind of pastry as older women do. I thought for the longest time that she lived alone but sometime in the following week, I glimpsed into her apartment on the way into mine. I made eye contact with a small face in the corner of her house which stared deeply. Barbara was on her way out and shut the door quickly, holding a large bag of garbage. 



“Do you live alone, Barbara?” I asked as I put the key into my lock. 



Barbara smiled and sighed while motioning to the trash she was hauling. “No.” She said while she brought her cane before her, sweeping it across the floor, “I have my son who visits quite often. But he’s quite the useless lump when he does visit!” 



I laughed and pushed my way into the studio. I let out a deep breath and tried to shake the image of those eyes out of my mind but I couldn’t. They were so empty and devoid of humanity. I made a note never to ask about Barbara’s situation again. It was none of my business anyway.



That night I opened my door to a light rat-tat-tat at my door which I knew would be Barbara. We talked briefly as she handed me another meal. However she mentioned that her son had helped her bake this one.



“That’s nice,” I had said, “I would bake if I had the time.”



“He loves to bake. How about I get him to make you his signature focaccia? It’s made with sardines, I just don’t know why! But it adds such a savoury taste that garlic and olives alone just won’t give you.”



“Focaccia?” I paused, “I thought focaccia was pretty advanced?”



“Not at all,” She chuckled, “Not for him! He’s quite skilled with his little hands.”



We bid goodbye for the night and I closed the door. I revealed another dish, this time a lasagna with large chunks of meat which looked to have been improperly ground. I cut myself a slice and assumed position in front of my laptop again. A few bites in, I felt something stringy in my mouth. It was getting caught on my tongue and between my teeth and gagged, dropping the plate onto my tiny table with a clang. I coughed viciously and stuck three fingers into my mouth and grabbed the string that had been causing me to choke. 



Surely it was a string from whatever meat product she had made, I had thought. A blind woman would have a hard time noticing something like that. I could no longer think when I pulled out a thick black clump of hair which looked as though it had been pulled off of a hairbrush and placed within the lasagna. I vomited right then and there and felt shaken the rest of the night while I cleaned my mess and threw out the food as quickly as I could. I saw many more pieces of hair within. For hours I could not shake the feeling of the hair and kept poking around in my mouth with my fingers as a phantom string kept appearing in my mouth. I fell asleep to the sounds of mewing once more, a cacophony of cats in the room next to me. 



Barbara did not appear to me for the next few days. I spotted a bag of cat food and some cans in front of her door one morning which vanished when I came home in the evening. A couple more deliveries occurred before the woman appeared to me once more. This time, she was hauling a very oversized cat crate which appeared to have a large cat within it. Despite my apprehension, I couldn’t bear to watch such an old lady haul such heavy cargo and I volunteered to help her at once. 



“You’re very sweet,” She said as I grabbed the crate from her, “If you could just get it past the stoop I’d be so grateful.”



So I hauled it over her tiny stoop and into her apartment. I was staring down as I took care to not bump the crate and when I finally looked into her apartment I hardly kept my jaw from falling onto the floor. The first thing that hit me was the stench. A grotesque mix of kitty litter and the odour of fecal matter and urine. Six different cat boxes lined together and a massive overcrowding of cat trees. 



“Just put him there,” Barbara motioned to a corner where identical empty crates rested. The room remained in darkness as I put it down. The cat within brushed my leg with what I presumed was its paw but when I looked down, I saw a very hairy finger caressing my ankle. I jumped away. My eyes widened to saucers when I finally met eyes with the thing in the cage, those eyes from before boring into mine. 



“Mew,” said the thing, a clearly human thing. It was completely nude and hairy from its cheeks to the tip of its finger, its nail being the only truly bare thing. It appeared to have extremely wet lips and a damp, pink nose to pair. Its abnormally long tongue rolled out of its mouth to reveal artificial spikes pierced into it as it licked the wire of the cage, the spikes getting stuck occasionally on the holes. The breath which radiated out of its mouth smelt like sewage and revealed teeth rotting from the tip to the root and covered with plaque. 



I looked back to Barbara who obviously stared blankly at us. She had a ghostly smile on her lips. 



“Rusty is quite old and so sweet,” Barbara said a bit sadly as she placed a couple muffins that she had resting on her counter. “That was Rusty I heard in the crate, wasn’t it?”



I rushed to the door and flipped on the light switch. It flickered weakly to reveal many more cat-things resting in the shadows. They were huge and I immediately knew they were all humans on some sick joke. They were all naked, I was certain, but covered in hair either glued or grown themselves. They all had tails which moved in sync left and right and a quiet hum which I had not noticed before became apparent. They all stared at me with circular eyes that tried their best to mimic a feline’s. Some of them quietly mewed when I roved my eyes over the ones I would dare to look at. 



“Do you like cats?” Barbara asked.



“I’m more of a dog person myself,” I swallowed. 



“That’s a shame. I’m a cat lady. When my husband passed away, I found I needed something to occupy myself with! Especially when the first cat turned up at my door, I found they all came one by one. Now I think I have about nine or so by the sounds of it. They eat so darn much, I can barely keep up with their appetites.”



A weird silence befell us as I nodded and she obviously expected a response. I could only stare as one of the cats walked on all fours to the nearest bowl and ate the kibble within then made to slurp up an open can of wet food beside it. It quenched itself with water from an automatic dispenser, revealing identical spikes to the cat in the crate.



“I’m sure you’re tired,” Barbara resumed, “Take these muffins. Thank you for helping me, darling.”



“No problem,” I managed as I took the muffins and retreated into the safety of my own apartment, only now noticing how many different voices really mewed from the apartment next door. I heard Barbara hushing them sweetly long after I left.



My mother didn’t believe me when I reached out the next day for advice. She was convinced I didn’t know what breed the cats really were, that I was ungrateful for everything the woman was doing for me, being judgmental as everyone in my generation usually was. 



“You always take people at face value and you don’t care to learn anything about them!” She had hollered, “Have you ever considered the stress is really just getting to you?”



Upon her suggestion, I thought maybe everything I had seen had been because of the low light and the stress I had been experiencing from working such long hours without nourishing my body. Maybe I’d hallucinated. The light in her apartment was so faint anyways, I couldn't be sure of anything. However, I was sure I didn’t want to receive any more food from Barbara. After a night of certain scratching on the walls next to me I decided I’d write her a note, give her some change and leave it at that so I never felt obligated to repay her. 



*Thank you for your kindness with helping me settle in,* I remember the note I read. I *hope this is enough to cover the expenses of ingredients and a bit more to help with your cats*. 



I took a deep breath as I left my apartment very late that night to ensure she was asleep and I wouldn’t be confronted. I slid the note and a small envelope under the door of Barbara’s apartment and turned until the sound of vigorous scratching on the door caught my attention. Then a very loud yowling from the other side. 



“Shh! Shh!” I tried to hush it as quickly as I could to not awake Barbara but it just would not stop. Out of curiosity and desperation, I turned the knob of the door to let the cat out. What turned to face me was a grown man just as tall as I with none of the cat-like features of the other things within the apartment. He acted like one of the things as he went on all fours and skittered out of the apartment and into the hallway. He was naked as well and I averted my eyes as he flashed me all the way down towards the entrance. I slammed the door shut and rushed back into my room.



Now I’m back on my laptop. I have work in two hours and I really should be leaving but I don’t think I want to after I’ve just released *something* into my apartment complex. I’ve rationalized everything up to this point but I just can’t understand a colony of cat-people being housed by a seemingly unaware, blind old woman. The hair, their nudeness, munching on the cat food she provided with what I knew to be a meager pension since she lived in a place like this.
