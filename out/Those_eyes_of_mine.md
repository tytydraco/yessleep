MayBel, my daughter, was beautiful. Everything from her looks to her personality, she had gorgeous long blonde hair and her personality was glamorous; but the most beautiful thing about her was her eyes. Her left eye was dark brown, with green and blue around the pupils, and her right eye was greenish blue with brown around the pupil. 

She was blessed with beautiful eyes and I treasured every moment I got to look into them.

Her eyes were unlike anything I’ve ever seen before, I always gave her compliments on them. From the time she was born all the way up to now. Her eyes were like diamonds, beautiful and rare. They even lit up a room when she smiled. 

She’s only 7 years old, but I feel like I can look into her eyes and see a deep soul and a huge heart.

Her birthday is on May the second, she’s a very hyper kid. She asks to pet every pet she sees, and she always runs off from me to talk to strangers on the street. One day I accidentally let her wander to far away from me. 

She made her way to a man. Unfazed, she asked the man if he wanted to be friends. She smiled, and her eyes twinkled under the afternoon sun. Then she noticed something.

The man had no eyes, just eye sockets and face full of scars. Now, MayBel was nice but she was only 7 and very, very, curious of the world around her. She didn’t know what she was about to say was rude, she really didn’t. If she had, she never would’ve said it. 

“Wow! You have no eyes, I’ve never seen that before,” she exclaimed excitedly, like she had seen a animal that went extinct a million years ago.

 “We’re like the total opposite, you have no eyes and everyone is always calling mine beautiful!” She really had idea what she said was mean, she didn’t. 

“Oh really, do they?” The guy rasped out, he looked like he was in his late fifties, he had wrinkles on his forehead and hands. His voice was raspy like he’d smoked a pack a day since he was born. “If only I had eyes to see yours with.” He said, then he slowly turned away and started walking off.

By the time I ran up to apologize for her behavior he had already crossed the street.

I chewed her out for being so insensitive, but I knew it wasn’t her fault. She’s only seven, and even though she’s smart for her age, she’s still just a kid. She didn’t mean anything by it.

I spend the rest of that evening teaching her that some things you just shouldn’t say.

It wasn’t until next week when everything went wrong. I let her outside to play, I went in for 2 minutes and she was gone. I looked all over she was no where, after 30 minutes of looking I called the police. I thought she left the yard and the cops would find her in less than an hour.

That was 2 years ago, she would be 9 now. 

They never found her, or any signs pointing to what happened to her. I asked for everything to be private, I didn’t want this on tv. I even hired a private investigator, nothing.

I had already lost her mom, and now I lost her. I think of her eyes everyday, the way I used to stare into them and tell her how beautiful they were.

I’m scared. I’m scared I’ll never see her again. I’m scared that something horrible happened to her. I’m scared. 

I just want the past 2 years to be a dream, I want to wake up with her next to me.

I went walking to clear my mind, it always helps. 

I ended up bumping into a guy, and I could’ve swore I had saw him somewhere. Wait. His eyes.

“Oh my god.” I said it so quiet it barely came out as a whisper. “Sorry?” His raspy voice replied.

“S-sorry your eyes, they just loo-look like my daughters,” I could see the scars around his face, I swear I’ve seen them before.”

“Yeah, I’ve always wanted to see the world through someone else’s eyes. These ones are perfect.”
