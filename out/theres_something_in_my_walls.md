I never wanted to own a house. Too much responsibility, too many things that could go wrong. But when my grandfather passed and left me his old home, selling it felt... wrong.

It wasn’t anything special—a 1950s ranch-style house, tucked deep in the woods of Pennsylvania. The kind of place that smelled like old books and cedar, with wood paneling that hadn’t been updated since the 70s. The floors creaked when you walked, the pipes groaned when you ran the water. All normal stuff for an old house.

At first, I barely noticed the noises at night. Houses settle. Wood expands and contracts. But then I started hearing something else.

Scratching.

At first, I thought it was mice. It always started around 2 or 3 AM—just a faint, rhythmic scritch, scritch, scritch behind the bedroom wall. I’d lie there, half-asleep, telling myself it was just some little rodent trying to find warmth.

But then it moved.

One night, I heard it in the hallway. Another night, near the living room. It wasn’t random, either. It was slow. Deliberate. Like someone tracing their fingers along the inside of the walls.

I set traps. Nothing.

I called an exterminator. He checked the attic, the basement, even drilled a small hole to check inside the walls. He found nothing. No droppings, no nests, no sign of an infestation.

His words stuck with me.

"If anything’s in there, it’s not an animal."

The scratching got worse after that.

One night, I woke up to something new. A whisper.

I was in that hazy state between sleep and waking when I heard it—so close it could’ve been right beside me.

"Let me out."

I sat up so fast my vision blurred. My breath came out in short, sharp gasps, fogging in the cold air.

Then I noticed the smell.

It was faint, but it was there—something damp, rotten, sour. Like old wood and decay.

I barely slept that night.

The next morning, I checked the house top to bottom. The walls looked normal—no holes, no cracks. But in the hallway, near the attic door, I found something.

A stain.

Dark. Deep red. Old enough that it had seeped into the wood.

I called my mom.

She hesitated when I asked about the house.

“Grandpa never liked people going in the attic,” she said finally. “I remember… once, when I was little, I tried to open the door. He grabbed me so fast his hands were shaking. He told me there was nothing up there for me. And then he locked it.”

My stomach twisted.

I hadn’t been up there yet. Hadn’t wanted to.

But now, I had to know.

The attic door groaned when I pulled it open. The air was thick with dust, stale and heavy. My flashlight swept over forgotten furniture, old boxes, the remnants of another life.

And then I saw it.

A door.

A small, wooden door built into the far wall. Barely big enough for a child to crawl through.

My throat went dry. This wasn’t normal.

I stepped closer. The handle was rusted but turned easily.

The smell hit me first.

Damp. Rotting.

Something dead.

My flashlight flickered.

And then—

A whisper.

Right against my ear.

"You shouldn’t be here."

I slammed the door shut and ran.

That night, I slept in my car. The next morning, I called a contractor, told him I needed the walls opened up.

When they cut into the drywall, I almost wished I hadn’t asked.

There was a space.

Narrow. Dark.

And in that space, curled into the corner, were bones.

Small bones.

Human.

The police came. They told me the remains belonged to a child, likely from sixty, maybe seventy years ago. Too decayed to identify. But there was something else.

The way the bones were positioned…

Whoever it was, they had been buried alive.

There were scratches on the wood.

Deep, desperate.

They had tried to claw their way out.

I left the house that same day. Put it up for sale, packed my things, and never looked back.

But sometimes, late at night, when I’m alone in my apartment, I swear I can still hear it.

The scratching.

The whisper.

"Let me out."
