Approximately 1 year ago 2023 during the summer break, one day I was home alone my sister mom dad went out to shop some stuff later that day my friends were coming over,
when my family left the house to shop I immediately went upstairs and sat in my room then on the brown couch that was upstairs and scrolling through YouTube short's on my phone to keep me distracted. Like at 5pm no one was home not even my family.

I was upstairs not downstairs so I started to hear noises downstairs in the kitchen like some metal falling like knifes spoons forks
just one I heard it the other time I heard it again I yelled "MOM ARE YOU HOME?" no response I yelled again "MOM ARE YOU HOME?"  no response I freaked out and went and jumped on the brown couch out side of my room the brown couch was upstairs so I jumped on it scared worried face just waiting for my parents to come back.

eventually my parents come back home yay relief phew I didn't say a single word what happened.

Then my friends came over at like probably 7-8pm then after a while we all went upstairs bla bla and then my parents room door was opened with the light on no one was there my friends next to me saw a shado on what seemed like a little person my room was across there's my friend told me they saw a shadow in that room when the lights were on.

I told my friend what happened at 5pm my friend claimed to be he's little sister I wasn't gonna believe that since what happened to me at 5pm

My friends left like 11pm or 12pm

I slept I woke up seemly scared of what happened yesterday 

December we shifted out of the house and now we're living in a new build house
