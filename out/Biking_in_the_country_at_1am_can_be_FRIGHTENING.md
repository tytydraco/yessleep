so when I was younger I used to be a bit of a thrill seeker, I lived in a quiet town called Roseville with like 800 ppl in it in the middle of nowhere(miles of country roads with nothing really on them in every direction). I was about 18 and I used to like to go out into the country on my bike at like 1-3am(until this happened lol) so I leave the house it was around 1am its like a 4 minute ride out of town to the nearest road township rd 14 and trussler rd is where it starts getting pitch black and the ride gets a bit scary, its in ayr ontario if you want to look at where I was for reference, ton of coyotes and nothing really that would kill you but its still scary being out there when you cant see a foot in front of your face with nothing but a crappy flash from my phone 16 years ago.. BUT I LOVED doing that, made me feel alive, I would point the phone at the road with 1 hand and guide myself to stay on the road or I was just gonna go right into the ditch/field..

anyways I'm only about a mile into township rd 14 from trussler when I can hear another bicycle and it was coming at me from ahead of me where theres not another small city for about 40 minutes and thats if you were fast biking not slowly trying to cruise in the dark, i could hear them pedaling like the same speed i was not fast just kinda pacing myself out in the middle of the pitch black and obviously i could hear the noise from the person biking was getting closer, that already freaked me out enough where as it got closer I didnt want to put my light towards them, so I just kept it really as low as I could to the road to light up as little of myself as I could and as I was riding by them cause I was thinking creepy killer on a bike trying to get me in the middle of the night I just had a really bad feeling about it but all of the sudden I heard a really quiet or younger girls voice that sounded about like my age maybe 15-18 that just said hey really casually and calmly right as they passed me... i replied hey back and that was it, but this is the CRAZY part that hit me like 2 min later, that person had no light or any way to navigate and it was LITERALLY impossible to bike on that road without some type of light, but as they biked away i kept turning around and then realized they had no light and they had no light while coming towards me and that FREAKED ME THE HELL OUT because i have insanely good vision and im convinced that was not possible.. also I had to turn around eventually to go back home and that was like the creepiest feeling I've ever had, even worse than farm dogs chasing me on my bike in the dark which is also super intimidating

been thinking of that encounter more and how weird it was in my later years and I just picture that person telling the exact same story from her perspective and also being like what the f was that LOL
