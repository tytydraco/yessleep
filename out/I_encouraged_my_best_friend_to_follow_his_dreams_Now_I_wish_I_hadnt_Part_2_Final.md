It was the police who told Sophie of course, and then me.

Cody had been in the apartment. Slumped on the couch, in T-shirt and jeans, with a deep vertical gash in one wrist, the blade next to his other hand, his phone not far off and, as it turned out, a not-inconsiderable amount of some dubious substance in his system. It seemed he’d reverted back to his old ways at the last, although to be fair the cutting was kind of new, for him. It was determined that he had died the previous evening, most likely only about half an hour or so after I received his text.

Well, what can you say to something like that?

&#x200B;

His death was generally assumed to be suicide, although there was no suicide note at the scene, and he had seemed to turned his life around after prison. But maybe things had been building up, after all, and the row with Sophie had helped push him over the edge …. The poor girl had to undergo some questioning as a matter of course, as did his equally unfortunate landlord, but really the police were not looking for anyone else in connection with his demise.  The official investigation had turned up not the least sign that anyone else had been in the apartment that fatal night, the one or two others in the building had seen or heard nothing, and there was no hint that anyone had even been in touch with him at all over those final few days.

Except me.

That brief text which he’d sent seemingly in the very hour of his death, and he’d used my name, so surely it couldn’t’ve just been sent randomly, by accident; and that peculiar (to say the least) ‘note’ with his handwriting that had arrived in my apartment. But while there was a definite record of the first, on both our devices, the second had completely vanished.

When the police invited me for a little friendly chat over our texting history from that night, I went along with my mind in a fog. It was creepy to think that while I had been texting and calling Cody back that evening he had been bleeding out, and passing out forever. However, sitting across a desk from a rather grim-faced official did help me to focus a bit. I rather hoped the cops would be able to shed some light on the whole business.

There wasn’t much we could tell each other, though. There was nothing they could’ve pinned on me, even if they’d really wanted to, and I refrained from entertaining them with the story of the second ‘message’ as there was no actual evidence I could produce and I didn’t know if they would just start to think me crazy or paranoid or whatever. I don’t know what *you* would’ve done, and I wondered since if I did the right thing but at the time I was feeling pretty messed up. And like I said they weren’t actually looking to blame anyone else for his death. From their point of view there really wasn’t anything untoward about the business – unless of course you counted suicide itself as an untoward business. The general feeling was that Cody had been quite a likely candidate for self-destruction given his past history and instability and I couldn’t really disagree. I had certainly never heard him speak out against the idea, although he had never seriously cut himself before *or* ever actually overdosed either, to the best of my knowledge. But he’d made sure of succeeding on his first proper attempt by combining the two. Just like him, really. Once he made his mind up to a thing there was no stopping him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Cody had quite a crowd of friends, old girlfriends and the like, to mourn him although to be sure his own family – such as he’d ever had – didn’t evince too much interest, as he’d not left a vast estate. Then came the funeral and cremation and such-like business, after which things resumed their usual course for the most part. But there were several people for whom his passing had notable lingering effects. His landlord for one - honestly it’s quite inconsiderate to mess up someone else’s property like that, you couldn’t imagine that the poor guy would ever want to rent out again. And of course there was Sophie who appeared as inconsolable as anyone could expect, not least because of the unwelcome scrutiny that she had been subject to in some quarters. She left town soon after the funeral and I’ve not seen or heard from her since. I felt bad for her of course, but despite our mutual confidences on the night of Cody’s death, there wasn’t really any continuing link between us.

And then there was me.

The messages I’d received on that fatal night continued to haunt me – especially the note. I was forced to the conclusion that it must’ve been some sort of dream or hallucination, broken only by Sophie’s call. True, I’m not generally given to visions of any kind; I was never a big fan of the kind of substances that Cody had frequently been a purveyor of in his misspent youth, for instance, and I don’t even dream much, usually. But, when I came to think about it, this had been a rare and special occasion, the sudden, unnatural death of an old friend, who had reached out to me at the last. So, was it so far-fetched to believe he had also managed to reach me in a more fundamental sense than just plain old boring texting, that he had somehow ‘sent’ his dying thoughts to me so that I had actually *seen* them imprinted on a sheet of paper, just as clearly as if he had written them out, complete with decorative blood stains.

Was *that* what it had really been?

I could remember all too clearly the words, suggestive of a strange rush of exhilaration:

*I did it! Hell to the yeah. Watch me burn, man. I’m hot.*

He’d ‘done it’, alright. He’d done gone killed himself. (I tried not to think too much about what the ‘burning’ might refer to, though.)

Maybe this was the closest he’d come to leaving a suicide note, although with no elaborations, no explanations.

Well, anyway, that was the best explanation I could come up with for what had happened, and I just couldn’t stop thinking about it all. Had our old friendship meant so much to him that he’d chosen to commune with me during his final extremity? Did it mean so much to *me*?

Actually, as far as that went, there was something which I finally had to admit plainly to myself. Deep down, for a while now, I had been feeling rather guilty, as if I’d really *abandoned* Cody, in a way, over the past year or so, and our old writing dreams. Maybe that was the crux of it all – that was why I had specifically a vision of his *writing*, in such dramatic fashion. It was my subconscious guilt coming back to bite me in the ass while my old writing buddy was dying. That put a rather different slant on things, but it basically still was the same explanation. Psychological or psychical - something beginning with ‘psych’, anyway.

And, as for the writing, it seemed that it had come to nothing, after all, in his case. No sign of any literary endeavors among his computer files; no publications, nothing more anyone could tell me on that front. Whatever grand literary visions he once might’ve harbored he evidently had never got round to realizing. That original idea he’d looked for hadn’t come in time. That first manuscript he’d promised to send to me had never materialized.

Or maybe, in the end, he *had* just abandoned those old dreams, too - settled down to a conventional life of regular work plus regular girlfriend, although that had all fallen apart at the last.

The whole affair left me feeling sad and dissatisfied, and with the persuasion that it still wasn’t the end of the story. *His* story, in more than one sense ….

And the essential questions remained.

I still didn’t really know why he texted me, and only me during that final night.

And then the business of that damned ‘note’. Although of *course* I must’ve imagined it, in some bizarre way, I had my moments of wondering if it had been objectively real after all, that someone *had* snuck it in and then back out again while I had been on the phone to Sophie. The fact that I had heard nothing, and my windows had all been securely locked, and and the complete lack of signs of any kind of break-in, or indeed of anyone even lurking near my apartment that night - all these things should have been proof against such a theory, but I couldn’t quite get it out of my head. And it left me on edge, half-expecting another bloodied message to come sliding underneath my door some night, although it never did. I think now I really should’ve told someone, but as the days passed it became harder and harder to do so.

And the final question: just *why* had he killed himself?

No answers. Nothing left but speculation, and even that would fade away.

And I was vouchsafed no more 'visions'. No more strange messages. Just my own continuing brooding thoughts, and uneasy suspicions.

I found myself murmuring aloud more than once, ‘Sorry Cody. Hope you’re at peace now, man,’ or words to that effect. I wished it with all my heart. Not just for his sake, but mine.

I should’ve known better.

Exactly two months after his death, he re-appeared.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, let me say straightaway that this *was* a dream. At least, it was a dream insofar as I had gone to bed and lain down and, in all likelihood, dropped off to sleep.  But I hesitate to call it ‘just’ a dream, because like that damned note, it felt so damn real.

We were in this drab, ill-lit, office-y type of place, and there was no-one else around. Cody was seated at a desk, while I watched him from the door. He looked so young, so intensely alive, as I remembered from long ago, when we had first become friends. But what I noticed most was the old, beat-up leather jacket he always used to wear back then. Somehow it was the sight of that jacket that brought it home to me that it *really* was him, in some essential, irrefutable sense. Another thing I noticed was that he kept his left hand in his jacket pocket all the time.

‘Hey man,’ was his greeting. He seemed quite relaxed. I was the one who was on edge.

‘I’m sorry dude,’ I blurted out. He looked puzzled.

‘For what?’

I had to stop and think why, exactly. For his death, I supposed, the way it had happened, and all, and also for being a less-than-conscientious friend in the last year or so.

‘Well, you know, for what happened,’ I almost stammered. He went on looking at me closely, so I went on lamely, ‘I mean, your … well, you know.’

He laughed. ‘Don’t be such a pussy, Jay. Just come out and *say* it.’

Actually I don’t think that I was even being such a pussy about it. It was just the awkwardness of the whole situation. It’s not the sort of thing you’d normally expect to have to say to anyone, after all. *Jeez man, sorry for your suicide. Hope it didn’t hurt too much. Hope it was damn well worth it. Good to see you looking so well in spite of it all.* I almost gave him the works, but stopped.

‘Anyway,’ he resumed, ‘there’s nothing to be sorry about. Doesn’t bother me at all.’ He fished a cigarette packet and lighter from his pocket, took out a cigarette and lit up, performing the entire operation one-handed in a swift, practised manner. So he still gets to smoke here, I thought. I could’ve asked him exactly where ‘here’ was, but somehow I didn’t think of it.

‘Well, I kind of feel like I could’ve tried to keep more in touch and all,’ I said.

He fixed me with an acid eye. ‘Keep tabs on me you mean? Prevent me from doing something stupid?’

‘No I *don’t* mean that, man. You *know* I don’t, or you should. I just mean – I could’ve kept in touch more, or something.’

He leaned back, took a long drag. ‘Sorry dude. That was uncalled for.’ He seemed content to just smoke for awhile, so I just stood and watched him. Finally, I asked the big question. ‘Why did you kill yourself?’

‘Not for the reasons that anyone thought,’ he replied. ‘All that patronizing lame shit they always come up with.’

‘It wasn’t because of what happened with Sophie, was it?’

He sighed exasperatedly. ‘Look, I just *told* ya it wasn’t why anyone thought. The only way *she* was involved was that I waited until she was out of the way to do it.’

‘Yea, she was only hanging around outside of the apartment that night, don’t you know?’ I told him. ‘She was worried sick about you. If she’d had her goddamn key and walked *in* on you –‘

‘Yeah, well she *didn’t* have her goddamn key.’ He paused. ‘What’s the point of dredging all this up again man? What’s done is done.’

‘But why did you do it?’ I persisted.

He looked at me, and his dark eyes seemed to grow darker. ‘Don’t kid yourself, Jay. *You* know why, if no-one else does. That’s why we’re having this conversation right now.’

I would have loved to pretend that I didn’t know what the fuck he was on about, but there had been that weird, nagging suspicion in my mind all along, that in some twisted, *ludicrous* sense he –

He seemed to read my unspoken thought. ‘Yeah, that’s why.’ His eyes gleamed. 'You know how you suggested that I write something original? Well, how about a post-suicide novel? Whole new *genre*, man. Hell, it's a whole new *branch* of literature. *Post-mortem* literature.'

‘Hey, don’t lay it on me,’ I bridled. ‘You know damn well I never meant anything like *that*.’

‘Chill, dude. I know you didn’t but still it’s what you said that day that really set me thinking.’

‘And *that’s* what you came up with? Killing yourself, just to *write* about it after?’ Just like he’d done all the other shit, to write about it. Yes, I *had* known all along.

‘Well, it’s kind of a different reason for suicide than the usual crap, don’t you think?’

Wow. He’d literally sacrificed himself for his art.

‘But – how does that even work?’ I protested. ‘How can you make it appear in the real world?'

‘I got it figured. I’ll send it to you like I sent that note. You know, the one with all the blood? That was kind of like a test, you know.’

I gawped at him for a second. ‘So *that’s* what that text meant.’ It all made a monstrous kind of sense. ‘That’s why you only got in touch with *me* then. You know, that really puzzled some people.’

He grinned. ‘Yeah, I figured it would.’

‘So you really did send it?’

‘Yeah. Once you replied to my text that night, it wasn’t so difficult.’

‘You mean – otherwise – it *wouldn’t’ve* come through?’

‘You showed an interest, so I sent it.’

‘Hey, I was only replying to you. It’s called good manners.’

‘Whatever, dude. Point is, you did reply, and quite enthusiastically, too. So I sent it.’

I decided to let this go. ‘So it did actually materialize? It was actually posted? It was there, *physically*?’

‘Yeah.’

*‘How?’*

He shrugged. ‘Can’t give away *every*thing now, can I?’

I stared at him as another realization began to dawn. ‘That was kind of  – a *post-suicide* note, right?’ I remembered again the words. *I did it.*

He grinned. ‘If you like.’

‘But, well, it … disappeared.’

‘Yeah, that’s what I gathered,’ he said thoughtfully. ‘Wouldn’t want that to happen again, to be sure. But I’m working on it. I can make things happen, man.  I got good contacts here.’

I could well believe it. He had always had good contacts in the old days, too, for weed or whatever.

‘It’s just about ready to be sent to you. My first manuscript, like I promised. You know I always meant what I said. I still do.’

Despite all my apprehension this was one thing I *couldn’t* believe. I’d already been waiting *years* for that manuscript.

‘So it’s *really* finished?’

‘Yeah. At first I was gonna handwrite it because it’s not that easy typing one-handed. I really fucked up my wrist you know. Apparently I’d cut even deeper than I thought.’ He sounded almost proud – when he did a thing, he did it properly.

‘But why should that still bother you? I mean - here.’

‘Some things just stay with you from the other side,’ he replied darkly. ‘Doesn’t bother me too much though.’

‘So you can’t get it fixed now?’

‘Well, I could maybe, but I won’t. I look on it as the price I had to pay for getting here, to do what I want to do.’ Evidently the whole business appealed to his artistic sensibilities in some warped way.

‘I’m guessing that the drugs didn’t wear off either, then?’ I could never quite tell when Cody was really high or whatever, in the old days. Not many *physical* signs. Except pupil dilation. His eyes were really dark by now, I mean nearly *all* dark, not just the irises, almost like one of those Black-Eyed Kids that some people claim to have seen, or something. Although that surely couldn’t *just* be drugs.

‘Hey, *every*one’s wasted here, dude. *My* crowd is anyways. You know, it’s been nice to go back to the old lifestyle in a lotta ways.’

I returned to the main subject. ‘So, you handwrote it?’

‘No, I didn’t. It would’ve taken too long. But I just decided to dictate and get other people to type it all up for me. There were several chicks here who were happy to oblige.’

‘I’ll bet.’

He grinned. ‘So watch out for it man. Real soon. It’s on its way, I promise you that.’

I groaned. ‘Shit, man, I know, well, I know it’s that old dream and all, but why couldn’t you just – well rest in peace, or something? Why not just let it alone? Why not let *me* alone?’

He leaned forward, his eyes, black gold eyes, tenacious pools, which seemed now to be spreading slowly over my own vision.

‘Hey, I could leave *you* alone, Jay, if you’d just leave *me* alone.’

&#x200B;

Hell of a conversation to have in a mere *dream,* right?

I woke up gasping. Another crazy vision to haunt me. Although at least this time I did actually wake up in my own bed. But so vivid once again, so real. This thing just wasn’t going to go away. This whole damned writing shit. My guilt for having let it slide, resolving into a vision of Cody and his unfinished business from the other side. Maybe I *had* better consult a shrink or counsellor or one of those types of people, much as I hated the idea. I didn’t want to be plagued by conversations with dead friends or pursued by visions of bloodied messages for the rest of my goddamn life.

&#x200B;

That was nearly a week ago. No more dreams since.

But I’m all tensed up waiting for something more to happen. I’ve been slacking off work, made some vague excuses about being sick. I don’t care if they believe me or not. The only thing I can concentrate on now is – this.

I didn’t see a counsellor or anything, after all. Instead I’ve spent my time writing all this shit down. That’s probably what a counsellor would’ve told me to do, anyway. Just like in the good old days. The influence of that old writing group has been hard to shake, goddamn it. But it does help to get your thoughts straight, it *can* help…. Or rather, it *could*’ve, if this business was in the past. But it’s not. Something tells me it’s not.

I’m waiting.

&#x200B;

Saturday evening once again. Nearly seven o’clock.

I’m in my apartment, looking at my phone every few moments, and my emails. I could just keep everything switched off, I know, talk to someone, try to stay in the sane, sober world as much as possible - but somehow I feel I’ve got to see this thing through.

My phone buzzes. And, almost at the same moment, from my laptop, I hear that pinging sound. *New email.*

I don’t dare look at either at first.

Then, finally, I glance down at my phone.

Cody\*. *Hey, Jay, Sending –*

It’s happening all over again.

I just freeze. Cold, cold horror.

It’s *got* to be some kind of hoax. Some psycho who’s got hold of Cody’s phone, Cody’s number, and my number and email address, someone who knows all about that writing shit, someone trying to drive me mad –

Or maybe I’m already stark, staring mad. Tripping the proverbial *balls*, man. Crazy as Cody himself ever was. *Still is?*

The phone buzzes again.

Cody\*: *Be sure to let me know what you think.*

I just stand with the phone in my hand, staring at the text. It’s as though I can’t look away.

It buzzes a third time.

Cody\*.\* *I really, REALLY* *wanna know what you think.*
