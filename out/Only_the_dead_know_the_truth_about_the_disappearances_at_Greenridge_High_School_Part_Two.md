We found Hannah, but before I dive into that I figured I would sprinkle in some good news. We spent a day at a motel I found on the way to Clearview Clinic. It wasn’t anything amazing but it wasn’t too bad either.   
  
Kira is finally starting to remember bits and pieces from her life, it’s coming back in small waves. She told me that she loves pizza, but only with specialty crust. She was never into performing on stage, she did that because it was what her mother wanted. Before we went to bed on the first night, she told me that she was also having headaches.   
  
It was quiet for a moment. I could tell she was trying to find the words to tell me something else.   
  
She finally got the nerve to tell me what the killer was saying while he was killing her.   
  
He told her that her gift would be her undoing and that she could not be allowed to grow.   
  
We sat together for a while longer, I didn’t know what to say to her. I mean what do you say to someone who is reliving the day they died?   
  
Hunter eventually did everyone a favor and turned the TV on. I'm not sure what they were watching but it kept them all entertained enough for me to go and take a shower.   
  
\-  
  
I couldn’t stop thinking about what Kira told me.   
  
Her gift would be her undoing. Kira didn’t have any special qualities, not any that stood out right away. It brought me to another question, who is the Red Masked killer anyway? So far each killer has been unique in the way that they killed and who they murdered.   
  
As far as I know, Red Mask has only been in the auditorium. Kira had to have been a specific target. Caleb told me her murder was specifically brutal too.   
  
Hunter's murder was over the top too. Before Caleb left he told me that the groundskeeper told him that the murders got increasingly more gruesome as time went on. In my head that puts Kira, Hunter, and Coraline's murder towards the end of the killings. I had no way of being sure, but it sounded right.   
  
\-  
  
Once I got out of the shower I ordered us a couple of pizzas. We got Hunter a large just for himself, and the rest of us shared two boxes. I wasn’t surprised to see how much he could eat. One of the fondest memories of my brother was watching him eat a whole gallon of ice cream in one sitting because Hannah dared him to.   
  
I tried not to think about my family too much. There was nothing I could do to bring my brother back and my parents vanished into thin air. But there was still hope for my sister, and I was going to put as much energy as I could into finding her.   
  
\-  
  
For the most part, we all slept okay on that first night, except for Coraline. She was good at hiding it but I knew she wasn’t sleeping okay. I woke up to her moving a chair so she could sit by the window.   
  
I got up and sat next to her on the floor.   
  
“Are we all going to die?” Coraline eventually asked me.   
  
“I hope not,” I told her seriously.   
  
I wanted to tell her that everything would be fine but I also didn’t want to lie. We could all die or we could all make it out of this alive. But I couldn’t know for sure.   
  
“Are you going to forget about us when you get your sister back?” Coraline asked as she moved to the side and looked down at me.   
  
“No. We are all going to get in my car and do whatever we have to do, together. No one is getting left behind and no one will be forgotten.” I promised her.   
  
We sat together in silence for a while longer before I stood up and made sure the door was locked. I knew I was going to sleep in and I didn’t want to take any chances.   
  
“I had them too.” Coraline started.   
  
“That day, I ran into my bully and her friends. I got beat up, and while they were hitting me I got one of my headaches. At that point, I was having them a lot.” Coraline mumbled.   
  
I watched her ball her fists. I could see the anger and hurt on her face, I couldn’t imagine what it was like to get beat up and murdered, on the same day.   
  
“I went to the bathroom after to try and calm down but the headache wouldn’t stop. On my way out the killer caught me and well, you know the rest.” She said to me without looking away from the window.   
I knew I would have to ask Hunter if he remembered anything in the morning: All of us having headaches couldn’t be a coincidence.   
  
“Thank you for telling me,” I said to Coraline as I walked back over to her and held my hand out.   
  
“We both need to get some rest,” I mumbled under my breath as she took my hand.   
  
I walked her back to the bed and went to sit on the spare bed. I wanted to run through the details more but I couldn’t stay awake any longer.   
  
\-  
  
The second day was spent doing as little as possible.   
  
I ordered everyone food again, trying to ignore how fast I was running out of cash, and made sure everyone took the time they needed to relax.   
  
Hunter told me he didn’t remember much about the day he died or anything before it. I assume that he and Kira will take some time to remember everything fully.   
  
“So where are we going?” Hunter asked me as he watched me fiddle with the GPS.   
  
“I’m trying to find the clinic,” I told him honestly.   
  
“How are we going to do that when all we have is a name?” Kira asked as she took another slice of pizza.   
  
Coraline slid the card off of the desk and held it close to her face, “There is a set of numbers under the name.”   
  
Hunter took her wrist so he could see the card.   
  
“No there's not.” He argued.   
  
“Easy,” I told Hunter as Coraline took her arm away from him.   
  
Kira and I couldn’t see any numbers on the card either, so I had Coraline read them to me. I thought she was telling a white lie to participate, but she wasn’t.   
  
I entered all of the information into the GPS.   
  
To my surprise, a destination finally popped up. The drive was going to be long. We spent the rest of the day resting before the big trip.   
  
\-  
  
To say the ride to Clearview Clinic sucked would be an understatement.   
  
I spent the majority of the drive with a throbbing headache. When I didn’t have one, Coraline did. She handled it like a champ but listening to her softly cry in the backseat was hell. I wasn’t mad that she was crying, I was pissed because there was nothing I could do to help her.   
  
Hunter got car sick, and we had to stop driving a lot. He apologized a ton but it was my fault for getting us food from a gas station.  
  
Kira was mostly quiet, but I could see something was bothering her the whole time. When I finally got her to tell me what was wrong, she told me she was having flashbacks. I tried to tell her stories to keep her calm.   
  
Eventually, we all became irritated when the GPS started spazzing out. First, it was taking us to Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey, and finally, we were told to take the first right and continue driving. Every time the GPS spoke a short pain ran from the back of my skull to right behind my ears.   
  
The more we followed the GPS the worse my headache got, but as soon as we stopped driving Coraline would get one. It was agony.   
  
\-  
  
As we drove towards the clinic the streets began to blur together, it was like I was driving with a fog over my head. The words on the radio began to fuse, it sounded like we were listening to gibberish.   
  
I turned to look at the back seat, the kids looked like they were out of it. It was like they had fallen into a trance. I remember wanting to turn back but I couldn’t wrap my head around letting my foot off of the gas.   
  
Eventually, we took a couple of left turns and found ourselves driving through a dense wooded area. As we passed the trees they began to look like they were dancing. I'm shocked I didn’t crash the car, it felt like I was being compelled to go forward.   
  
Once we were out of the wooded area we hit a highway. As I drove down the long stretch of road the signs on the side blurred together. It was like I was watching strobe lights.   
  
The GPS was hollering at us, I had never heard anything like it. The machine demanded that I keep driving until finally demanding that I take a left.   
\-  
  
“This was awful, let’s never do it again,” Hunter mumbled to the car as we pulled up to the clinic.   
  
We couldn’t help but laugh. The whole trip he has been a fantastic source of comic relief.   
  
I opened my door and stepped out. I could hear Hunter trying to turn the GPS off in the car, it was screaming that we had finally reached our destination.   
  
\-  
  
The clinic looked beautifully maintained outside, but no other cars were outside. All of the lights were on in the building, but I couldn’t see anyone or anything moving around through the large glass windows in the front of the building.   
  
The Clearview Clinic sign was in perfect condition.   
  
I was surprised to see how nice everything looked on the outside. I didn’t trust this for a second though, considering how we got here.   
  
\-  
  
“Are we staying in the car?” Hunter asked.   
  
“No,” Coraline said as she stepped out.   
  
“Yeah, I am not waiting here,” Kira said as she followed Coraline.   
  
Part of me thought it was a bad idea to take them with me, but what if something happened to them in the parking lot? We had no idea where we were and getting here was extremely confusing.   
  
“Does your head still hurt?” I asked Coraline as I moved to the back of the car and opened the trunk. I started to hand out our backpacks and the weapons we had been using.   
  
“No. You?” Coraline asked me as I gave her my crowbar.   
  
“Yes,” I said honestly.   
  
“We are going to walk in here armed to the teeth?” Hunter asked us as he took the baseball bat from me.   
  
“We had to drive to the middle of nowhere to reach this place. The GPS was screaming at us as we got closer. All of the lights are on but no one can be seen. Hell yes, we are bringing weapons.” Kira grumbled.   
  
“Stay as close to me as possible,” I told the kids as we walked towards the front doors of the clinic.   
  
\-  
  
As we walked into the clinic my shoes squeeked off of the floor. The floor was a bright white, and the waiting room to the left of the door had a clean blue carpet and two rows of chairs.   
  
I walked up to the front desk and looked around, there was no one there. I could see stacks of empty papers behind the desk, the computer was flashing repeatedly.   
  
“Hello?” I called.   
  
“Cassandra.” A familiar voice rang out as a man came down the hallway.   
  
I turned to the side and couldn’t help but smile. The janitor from the high school was standing there mopping the floor.   
  
“How are you here?” I asked him.   
  
“As a Spirit Medium traveling to Clearview Clinic? I am not surprised.” The janitor told me as he dunked the mop into the bucket.   
  
“You come with a Seer, that is smart. But they should not follow you further.” The janitor warned me as he cleaned the floor.   
  
“A what?” Kira asked him.   
  
“You had to travel through the Veil to get here, be warned, you’ll have to travel through the Veil again to leave.” The janitor said as he put the mop back in the bucket and started walking away.   
  
\-  
  
“Cassandra, who was that?” Hunter asked me as we all swapped weapons. I took the baseball bat for myself and slung my bag over my shoulder.   
  
“A friend,” I said honestly as I motioned to the waiting room.   
  
“Sit tight. I’ll be right back.” I told them with a small smile.   
  
\-  
  
As I walked down the hallway I used the baseball bat to nudge open doors. Every room looked too clean like nothing in there was ever used.   
  
“Hannah?” I screamed as I checked the doors.   
  
As I passed the first set of double doors, I could hear someone talking down the hallway. I walked as fast as I could to the voice. The closer I got to it the more hopeful I became, maybe someone was working here after all?   
  
I was wrong.   
  
Once I got further down the hallway I could see a man with a long white coat standing at one of the doors.   
  
“Cassandra?” He called to me as he turned towards me.   
  
His face was wrapped up in gauze, his hands were dripping blood. I could see bits of his skin peeled back on his knuckles. His scrubs were coated in dry blood and vomit.   
  
A twinge of pain shot through my head. My brain was screaming at me, I turned around as fast as possible and went running down the hallway.   
  
\-  
  
As I ran down the hallway waves of dread and dismay washed over me. I couldn’t find the door I came in from. It was like the hallway stretched forever. I repeatedly passed doors 4, 2, and 7 over and over again.   
  
I could hear the man chasing me.   
  
Eventually, I found a staircase. I was shaking with trepidation but I knew I had no choice. I pushed the door open and ran up the stairs as fast as I could.   
  
\-  
  
When I reached the second floor the atmosphere of the clinic changed completely. Gone were the pristine white floors, they were replaced by stained flooring that looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in decades.   
  
The wallpaper was peeling, and some of the doors were falling off of their hinges.   
  
“Cass?” A voice called out to me as I spun in the hallway.   
  
I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was Hannah. She had blood all over her face, her school jacket was caked in dry blood, and she was missing a shoe. But I would recognize her anywhere.   
  
“Hannah.” I gasped as I ran over to her and threw my arms around her.   
  
She sunk her nails into my back.   
  
As we stood there hugging I could hear whistling coming from down the hallway.   
  
I took Hannah by the arm and turned to run to the closest room.   
  
“The Whistler is coming,” Hannah whispered.   
  
“I know,” I whispered back as we slowly entered the closest room. I was more careful with the door this time.   
  
The only place to hide was the metal closet. I wanted to ask Hannah where she had been and why she didn’t leave, but there was no time yet.   
  
Hannah slowly opened the closet door and stepped inside. I climbed in next to her and exhaled.   
  
\-  
  
“I know you’re in here.” I could hear the man say, I heard his shoe make contact with the door, and I heard the door hit the wall as he kicked it open.   
  
My heart began to race again, I could feel the tears gathering in my eyes. I hated feeling so helpless, so afraid.   
  
“Come on little ones.” The man hissed. I could hear him approaching the closet.   
  
My hand clenched around the bat.   
  
“Open the door, Hannah.” The man screamed as he shook the closet.   
  
“Open the goddamn door you heretics!” He screamed again.   
  
The anger in his voice made my heart skip a beat, but only for a split second. I was shaking, I was terrified, but I knew we had to do something or risk dying in here.   
  
I screamed back and threw the doors open, Hannah ran from my side, and with one strong swing, I brought the bat up and slammed it off of the man's head. I darted out of the closet after and ran after Hannah.   
  
“You can’t leave!” He called as he ran out after us.   
  
I turned my head to watch him for a second, he looked much worse here than he did at Greenridge. His face was falling apart and he wasn’t nearly as fast. His hair was disheveled, and he ran with a limp.   
  
“The stairs!” I snapped at Hannah as I swung the door to the staircase open.   
  
I was still trembling, I thought I was going to lose the baseball bat. As we ran down the stairs I used my free arm to clean the tears from my face. Once we reached the bottom, I used the bat to push the door open.   
  
We ran into the hallway, I thought we were going to be home free until I felt something sharp pierce my back.   
  
I reached my arm back and slowly pulled a scapple out of my back. I winced and continued to run forward.   
  
“You can’t leave! You can’t! I need you!” I heard the doctor call from behind me.   
  
\-  
  
I turned a corner with Hannah and stopped in my tracks. I could hear her screaming my name, but everything else was hazy. There was a ringing in my ears.   
  
I looked down, there was something sharp sticking out of my side. I tilted my head up and looked at the woman coming out of the door next to me.   
  
“We can’t let you leave. You’ll change everything.” The woman hissed at me.   
  
Her face looked like it was ripped up by a blade. One of her eyes was missing, and her lipstick was smeared all over her lips.   
  
I thought I was going to die. I gasped and coughed as I grabbed the woman's wrist. My body shook and I turned my head to Hannah. I watched her raise my baseball bat and slam it off of the woman's head.   
  
“Don’t pull out the blade,” Hannah said as we walked as fast as possible to the closest door. I recognized it, it was the door I entered from. Hannah put her hand out to open the door, but it wouldn’t budge.   
  
“Hunter! Kira!” I screamed at the door.   
  
\-  
  
“Cass. We have to get out of here.” Hannah said as she pushed on the door again.   
I leaned forward to try and help her open it, and the door flickered. Together we were able to push the door open.   
  
As we ran down the hallway, I grabbed my side and slid the blade out. I tossed it to the side and continued to hobble with Hannah.   
  
Once we reached the lobby I screamed for the kids to follow me. They came running out of the waiting room, and we ran out of the front door.   
  
“Cassandra you’re bleeding!” Hunter screamed at me as we ran to the car.   
  
“I’m fine.” I insisted as we climbed into the car.   
  
“You’re not fine!” Kira and Hannah yelled at me in unison.   
  
I went into my backpack and pulled out a first aid kit. I raised my shirt and started to dress my wound.   
  
“It wasn’t that deep. It just took me by surprise.” I told them as I cleaned the wound and finished dressing it.   
  
\-  
  
As I sat there trying to catch my breath, my phone went off.   
  
I reached over and grabbed my phone to answer it, I was surprised to see it was Caleb calling me.   
  
We talked for a couple of minutes while I was catching my breath. I passed the first aid kit back to Hannah, I figured she could get some of her wounds dressed and I would help her with the rest later.   
  
To make a long conversation short, Caleb told us to go back to Greenridge. He was going to meet us at his house. I told him that I packed up the evidence when we left and I would bring everything back.   
  
I filled him in about finding Hannah, the Whistler, and the clinic.   
  
\-  
  
“Guys, I know this has been a long trip but we have to get back. We need to meet Caleb.” I told the car as I clenched the steering wheel.   
  
My anxiety was through the roof. I was still shaking from fear, but we had to get going. There was no way I was going to let us sleep in the parking lot of the clinic.   
  
We drove for a few hours before I finally found a motel to rest at. I got all of the introductions out of the way, helped Hannah get cleaned up, and we all were able to get some rest.
