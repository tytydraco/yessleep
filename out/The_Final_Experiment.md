Dear Dr. Sharon Levin,

If you're reading this, it's probably too late for me. I must document what happened here at the underground research facility "Tehom-1". Someone needs to know the truth.

It all started six months ago when I was appointed as the lead researcher for Project "Depths". The budget was unlimited, and the goal was simple - to investigate the strange phenomena discovered in Israel's deepest drilling site, 5.7 kilometers beneath the surface.

It began with the sounds. The sensitive microphones we installed picked up what sounded like whispers. At first, we thought it was just interference, but when we amplified the recordings... the voices were speaking. Not in Hebrew, not in English, not in any known language. But they were definitely speaking.

Then there were the samples. Something about these ancient rocks wasn't right. Under the microscope, we saw cells that appeared... alive. But not like anything we'd seen before. They multiplied and evolved at an impossible rate, even at temperatures that should have made life impossible.

Third month into the project: Dr. Cohen, our biologist, started acting strange. She talked about voices calling her at night, about dreams where she saw "them". When we tried to send her home to rest, she hysterically refused. "They won't let me leave," she screamed. "They're already inside me."

The next day we found her in the lab. Or what was left of her. Her body... had changed. Her skin looked like a thin membrane over something moving underneath. Her eyes... weren't eyes anymore.

But she was still alive.

Fourth month: We lost contact with the outside world. Something blocked all communications. The elevators stopped working. We were left with 12 staff members, trapped 300 meters underground. And the "samples" kept evolving.

Dr. Cohen wasn't the only one who changed. One by one, crew members started hearing the voices. Seeing things. Changing.

Yesterday there were only three of us left - me, Dr. Mizrahi, and Danny the technician. We locked ourselves in the central lab. They... the others... roamed the corridors. They didn't look human anymore.

This morning Danny started coughing. Black liquid came out of his mouth. His eyes... they just melted. He's still breathing. Still moving. But he's not Danny anymore.

Dr. Mizrahi shot himself an hour ago. Maybe he was the smartest of us all.

I can hear them now, outside the door. They're calling me in voices that sound like everyone I've ever known, yet nothing human at all. The door won't hold much longer.

But that's not the point. The point is that I understand now - they didn't come from below. They were always here, waiting. The drilling just... woke them up.

And they're hungry. So hungry.

Dr. Levin, if you're reading this - blow up the facility. Seal the drill. Kill us all. Because if you don't...

Editor's note: The following document was found in a classified Defense Ministry file. Attached was a note:

"The 'Tehom-1' incident ended with a controlled explosion of the facility on July 15, 2024. The area was sealed and declared a closed military zone. All staff perished."

Addition dated February 1, 2025:
"Reports of strange sounds coming from the area. Residents within 20 km report unusual dreams. Three cases of mysterious disappearances in the last month.

Urgent update: Sensors show something moving in the depths. Something big.

And it's coming up."

Text message received on Dr. Sharon Levin's device, 02/01/2025, 03:33:

"Dear Sharon,
Remember me? It's Daniel, from the lab.
We miss you.
Look under your bed.
We're waiting.
We're so hungry..."

*Police note: Dr. Sharon Levin disappeared from her home on 02/01/2025. The search continues.
The only thing found in her bedroom was a black liquid stain on the floor, and what appeared to be fingerprints on the ceiling.*

From the investigation diary of Chief Inspector Ronen Adri, 02/02/2025:

"Something's wrong. I hear voices at night. Yesterday I saw something moving under the skin of my hand.
I think they found me.
I think they found all of us.
They're coming."

The file ends here. The following text was written in black liquid on the screen:

"You who are reading this now.
Yes, you.
You think this is just a story?
Look at your hands.
Do you see the black veins?
It's already begun.
We're coming.
We're already here.
Inside you."
