I woke up to the something on my roof. It sounded like hooves from a deer or horse. I tried to get up to call the cops cause I thought it might be someone trying to break in, but I couldn't move. I tried and I could not move at all. After a few moments I heard something crawl down the chimney and I knew whoev3r it was was inside. That was when I heard my daughter's door open. At that moment I knew I needed to get up, so I tried again but still could not move. I tried to tell at her to go back to her room but I could speak. I heard her little feet run down the stairs than I heard her scream. After she screamed it was silent. Than there was the sound of something crawling back up the chimney. That was all I remember till I woke up the next morning.

Normally at this time my daughter runs in and Wakes me, but it was quite. I thought that what I heard last night was a dream, so I got up thinking my daughter was still asleep. When I got to the stairs I saw her door open. I thought nothing of it and thought maybe she was up and already down stairs. I walked down stairs but I didn't see her. She was gone I looked everywhere for her. And she was no where to be seen. I called the 911 and told them my daughter was missing.

12/25/2021 8:04 am

I heard a knock at the door.

"Mr. Smith it's the police department come to the door we have a few questions." One of the officers said through the door.  I got up and headed to the door. The red and blue lights from their car was flashing through the window. I opened the door.

"Officers please come in it's cold out there" I said quietly. The officers walked in and shook off the snow on their boots. "Would you like some coffee?" I asked.

"No thank you we had some on the way here" the female officer said. I nodded and led them into the living room. "So Mr.Smith you said your daughter was missing?" The Female officer said.

"Yes, she is" I said quickly.

"Alright did you hear anything or see anything?" The male officer said while pulling out a notebook. 

"Look, this may sound crazy..., But" I pause for a second to figure out how to explain this. "Last night I woke up to the sound of something on my roof. Than I heard something crawl down the chimney. Than I heard my daughter run downstairs. She screamed and than something or someone crawled back up the chimney." 

"So, your saying your daughter was taken by Santa? The jolly old guy adults lie to their kids about to make them behave?" The male officer  with a smirk.

"Look officer I'm not saying anything, but someone took my fucking daughter last night alright I don't know if it was fucking Santa or some druggei looking for money, but someone took my daughter." I said getting a little upset.

"Alright please calm down. Can we look around for any signs of forced entry?" The female officer said. I nodded and they looked. This took about 30 minutes as they needed to look at every window and door. "Alright sir there does not seem to be any signs of forced entry. Is it possible she ran away?"

"No she would never." I said loudly.

"Alright, well we need to ask you questions about her for an amber alert." She added. After a few minutes we where done. "Alright, to make sure I have everything correct. Your daughter's name is Lily Smith, she is 6 years old, she has black hair, she is around 3' 6", she has a scar on her right cheek from a car accident that killed your wife and her mother. The last thing she was wearing was red pajamas with white snow flakes. Is this all correct?" She asked.

"Yes it is. Officers please find her I can't loose her aswell!" I said knowing they might never find her.

"We will do the best we can but there are no promises." The male officer said. After the questions I had to fill out a statement and they left. They said they will contact me with any updates.

I was on my computer searching to see if anyone had the same thing happen to them. That is when I came across a man by the user name Clausehunter91 he made a post about how his son went missing the same night. Messaged him and told him what happened to me. He responded I instantly.

Clausehunter91: is you story true?

Me: yes it all happened the other night. It still doesn't fell real to me.

Clausehunter91: it's real and dont forget it. Now we need people to understand what happened.

Me: I called the cops and they are looking for my daughter and I still think it was all just someone breaking in and kidnaping her.

Clausehunter91: NO IT WASN'T

me: alright alright

We talked back and forth and we came to the conclusion that we will find out what really happened. 

12/31/2021 12:36 pm

I went outside and got a ladder. I knew if what I heard really happened than there would be evidence of it on the roof. I put the ladder against the gutter and climbed up it. On the roof I found what I was looking for. Sleigh tracks and the tracks of multiple deer or reindeer. I took out my phone and cot a picture. Thankfully it didn't snow since the 20th. I got back down and sent the pictures to Clausehunter91. He responded by saying he also found tracks like that on his roof.

12/31/2021 2:30 pm

I got a call from the police department saying they will have to call off the search since they hadn't got any leads or any evidence of a kidnaping. I pleased with them to continue searching, and they said that will keep an eye out for her. I decided not to show the pictures to the police cause they would think I am even more crazy. After a few days than weeks that. Months I concluded that the police would never find my daughter.

It has been almost a year since my daughter's disappearance. I kept in touch with Clausehunter91 and he told be that when Christmas came around be will kill what took his son. I decided I would try aswell. That is if the person who did came back. I bought a gun a few months after my daughter went missing. I was debating on using it on myself since I didnt have any family left. She would have been 7 by now. She absolutely loved Christmas like most kids. She was the only light left in my world. After her mother died in a car accident she was all I had left.

12/24/2022 11:40 pm 

I decided to stay up since that is all I can do. I have the gun next to me. I got a call from Clausehunter91 who's name is Chad. He said he heard the sounds again. In that call I heard the sounds of gun shots. Than his scream than nothing. The line went dead. I gripped the gun tightly to the point my knuckles where white. 

12/25/2022 12:32 am 

I heard it again. The sound of hooves and something walking on the roof. I sat in front of the chimney waiting. I raised the gun as I heard something crawling down the chimney. A hand reached out from inside the chimney. It was different it's fingers where long and had sharp claws. It was white like a person's hand. Than I saw it the face of the real Santa Clause. The face is forever burned into my mind. The signature red pointed hat, red beard and mustache. The face looked human. But the eyes where black and small and it's mouth was big and had sharp teeth. While the body was skinny and tall with long legs and arms. The face was also elongated. I stared into its eyes as it stared back at me. I pointed my gun at it as it reached into its bag. It pulled out a box it was about the size of a pumpkin. It handed to me. I kept the gun pointed at it as I grabbed the box from it's large and when I grabbed it was heavy. I nearly dropped it. I dropped they gun and reached to stabilize the box out of instinct. That is when it spoke.

"Open the box lance Smith. It is special made for you." It said in a very raspy voice almost like nails on a chalkboard. It pointed to the box. I hesitated for a moment. My heart was pounding and I started breathing hard. That is when I noticed the smell. It smelled like rotten meat. I feared the worst. Than I opened the box. I stared at the contents for a few seconds than I reached for the gun screaming. I grabbed it and shot at the creature. I successfully hit it in it's skinny chest but all it did was stand there. "I will be back lance Smith" it said in the same voice. I sat on the floor staring at the box. I started crying. 

12/25/1:00 am

I was still sitting at the floor staring at the box when I heard sirens. They got louder. I heard a loud knock at the door. "Mr.Smith this is the police we got a call about gunshots from your house. Please come to the door." I continued sitting there unfazed. The police broke down the door. When they got into view they say the box and froze. After a few seconds one of them walked to me and lifted me up. I continued staring at the  box  until he forced me out of the  room. a few minutes passed.

"What kind of sick bastard would send a guy the head of his own daughter." One of the officers said.

"I don't know but it is just sick. The girl was only like what 6 or 7." While they talked I just sat there in a daze. 

"Mr.smith can you tell us what happened?" A female officer asked. I could talk. All I did in that moment was throw up. She asked me again. 

"I-I don't know. It just all happened. That-" I didn't want to tell them because I didn't want them to think I was crazy. 

"That what Mr.Smith?" She asked.

"Nevermind" I said.

"Did you see the person who did this?" She asked.

"No I didn't all I saw what the box at my front door when I went downstairs to get me some water." I said. They continued berating me with questions. I did my best to answer them.

12/30/2022 1:40 pm

After that all happened I tried to get ahold of Chad but he never answered. I asked the police about, but they told me that his house was empty when they got a welfare call on him. I tried my best to forget about all of this but I couldn't.

I sit here now writing this. I stocked up on guns this year. I will kill that thing. I tried to look for people who all shared my experiences so this is why I am writing this. I hope someone out there knows something. And I hope no one else goes through what I did. Ease beware on Christmas. If you hear Santa on your roof don't leave your room dont let your kids stay up at night. And god please don't let your kids sneak a peek at Santa.
