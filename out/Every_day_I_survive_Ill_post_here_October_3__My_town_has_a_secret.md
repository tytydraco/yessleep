Tonight, Amy Stewart killed her last remaining child. He was ten.

We were at the town meeting when we found out. Technically, attendance every year is mandatory, but given the circumstances, I couldn't imagine anyone would want to be anywhere else tonight.

People packed the library full by 2:30 pm, a full two and a half hours before Sheriff Nix scheduled the meeting to start. The air was already thick with tension. Debra Meyers had been petitioning Sheriff Nix ever since she arrived to start the meeting early, and she had more than a little support.

Sheriff Nix stood her ground.

“We’re all here, Nix. What’s the goddamn holdup?”

“I hear you, Deb,” she said. “But what this town needs most right now is for everything to feel _normal_. I promise we’ll get everyone home well before dark.”

Nix and her baby-faced deputy Ricky weren’t even brandishing their guns tonight. No weapons at all, in fact. Nix committed to pretending everything was normal.

“Before dark.” A sharp, scathing laugh escaped Deb’s belly. “Bullshit. It’s all bullshit, and you know it. All these plans, town meetings. Bull. Shit.”

Debra was right. Nobody really knows what’s going to happen this year. Not anymore. And no amount of town meetings or community votes was going to change that. Last year changed things. Everyone’s afraid.

“What’d I miss?” Beth said, plopping down in the empty seat next to me, chewing on a cookie she had taken from the potluck table.

“The usual,” I said, motioning towards Debra. Beth shoved a spare cookie into my palm.

“Eat.” Beth’s arrival had caught the attention of Deputy Ricky, who had been hiding away against a wall. If you had asked him, I’m sure he would’ve said he was taking attendance. If you asked me, he was avoiding the wrath of Debra.

“Hey, Beth.” He hesitated for a moment, trying to find words. “Glad you’re here.” She shrugged.

“Wouldn't I get arrested if I wasn't?” Ricky frowned.

“Nobody gets arrested, you know that. I just meant—“

“I know what you meant, Rick.” A gentle laugh escaped her lips. She was probably the only one who could have a sense of humor and levity during everything.

“Oh, right,” Ricky said.

“We’re not all here, we can’t—“ Nix said, still pleading with Debra.

“You know as well as I do. Amy isn’t showing up. You’re putting everyone’s _lives_ in danger. Just say what you came to say and let us go home.”

“There’s no reason to believe anyone is in danger.” Debra scoffed and shoved a finger into Nix’s chest.

“Bullshit.” Nix let out a sigh.

“You think Amy is going to show up?” Ricky asked Beth. She shrugged, trying to deflect the conversation. She usually did when Amy’s family came up around me. I appreciated it.

_Thump-thump._

The sound of a heartbeat rang in my ears. Adrenaline flooded my veins. _No, it can’t be. I misheard._

I checked my phone. 2:45. _It can’t be._

I stood up and looked around the room at the children. About half of the children had frozen in place, their eyes planted on the windows.

_Thump-thump._

All the children heard it that time. And I did, too, despite being a full six months past when I should be able to.

A commotion grabbed the attention of the adults. Some children whined. Others grabbed at their parents. Some others simply stared out the windows. Even the teenagers congregated in the back of the room stopped talking.

But my eyes went to Ricky.

“Ricky.” He looked annoyed at the conversation I interrupted, and stuck up a finger at me, signaling me to wait. My eyes glanced towards Sheriff Nix, who hadn’t noticed the building commotion.

“Ricky, this can’t wait,” I said, my eyes darting around the room.

_Thump-thump._

“Ricky!” I grabbed him by the shoulders.

“God damnit, what?”

“Heartbeats.” His eyes followed my hand as I motioned around the room to the children. I paused a beat before continuing. “I heard them too.” The color drained from his bronze cheeks. He jogged over to the Sheriff, forcing his way between Debra and Nix.

“Sheriff. It’s happening. It’s here.” Nix glanced at her phone.

“It can’t be, it’s not even—“

“Caleb heard them himself.” Nix turned toward me. I nodded, but I don’t think I needed to. Whatever she saw in my face must have confirmed it. She looked around the room.

“Excuse me, everyone. Can I have your attention, please?”

Sheriff Nix had a knack for getting command of a room. Most of the time, Red Pine was a quiet town. Committing crimes is a laughable idea when everyone knows everyone and nobody can leave. 11 months out of the year, her duties involved breaking up underage parties and the occasional drunken brawl down at the one bar in town.

But come October, people listen.

A hush fell over the room.

“I’d like everyone who has heard the heartbeat to raise their hand.” One after another, a slew of hands poked into the air.

Hushed gasps filled the room. Parents held their children closer. Gasps turned to whispers. Whispers turned to yelling. People stood up. Some started pointing. Debra stood beside the Sheriff, arms crossed with an indignant “I told you so” written across her body. At any second, panic threatened to take us all. Nix knew it.

_Thump-thump._

“Okay, everyone. We have a plan. We spent the whole last year talking about this. You all have the information available to you on the Hub. We printed out packets that you can pick up in the folders on the tables by the entrance for those of you that want hard copies. Everyone, please go home. Deputy Yang and I will come along to make sure your home protection is in place.”

Ricky raised his eyebrows as if to say, “we will?”

People murmured in agreement, and the volcano cooled for a moment. Beth and I exchanged a worried glance as people filed towards the back of the room. Nix sighed, rubbing her temples. She tried to not to show it, but she was scared. So was Debra. So was I.

Then we all heard the laughing. Anyone who wasn’t scared before sure as hell was then. The laughing had never come until midnight. Even last year. I always imagined it as their idea of a parade to mark the beginning of the festivities. It was unmistakable.

Each year, they enclose the town, expelling their raucous, fake laughter. From a distance, you might believe them to be human. They walk like us, look like us. But they’re anything but human.

They’ll walk to the windows of every house and every building and stand and laugh for hours. And if you’re brave enough to watch, to get close enough to really see, that’s how you know it’s fake. You can see it in their rigid posture. You can see it in their gaping mouths. And you can see it in their bulging, red veins pulsing in the corners of their empty eyes. They have no joy. Only malice.

Nix raced to the window. Outside the long floor to ceiling windows on the western side was a modest park. It contained a swing, a sandbox, and a dying community garden that we always failed to upkeep in October. Just beyond that was a patch of field, and then a steep hill, behind which the creatures always come.

The laughter grew louder. Nix’s eyes narrowed. Figures rose over the hilltop.

_Thump-thump._

_Fuck._

A bubbling of wails rose outside as people saw the creatures.

“Ricky.” The Deputy’s eyes fixated on the hillside, glazed over in shock and disbelief.

“Ricky!” Nix shook him by the shoulders. “Get these people home. We’ll split the town, I’ll do the Westerman’s and—“

The panicked rumblings outside had exploded into full-blown screams.

“Oh my god, she has Jackson.”

Nix pushed her way outside only a moment before I could. We broke through the crowd. Amy Stewart was marching her way through the park, dragging her wailing ten-year-old son Jackson behind her in one hand, and brandishing a pistol in the other.

“Amy! You stop right now!” Nix screamed as she sprinted. The rest of us watched in horror. It was too late. Amy was already through the park. Nix ran anyway. Amy wheeled around and pointed the gun at the Sheriff’s face. Nix stopped and raised her hands.

_Thump-thump._

None of us could hear what anyone said. But we could all see the naked creatures behind them march closer and closer with each second. A heavy figure bowled his way through the crowd, alcohol billowing off of his breath. Tom. Amy’s ex-husband.

“Amy! Oh god, Amy. That’s our _boy_! What are you doing?” He stumbled a few more steps forward. Ricky intervened.

“Tom, Sheriff Nix is—“

“Get off me!” Tom bellowed. He shrugged off the Deputy who was half his size, but was too drunk to keep his feet. The pair toppled to the ground.

Nix lunged towards Amy. A struggle ensued for a second or two. The three toppled to the ground.

Jackson didn’t stop crying until the gunshot.

_Thump-thump._

Nix tried for a moment to pull Amy away, but ended up fleeing moments before the crowd of creatures surrounded her. Nix, breathless, made it back to the library.

“Everyone inside!” She commanded.

“My boy!” Tom wailed. “That’s my boy!”

“Inside the library? Does it even have the protections?” Debra protested.

“No.” Nix responded flatly. “But I don’t know if they’d work, anyway. That’s what you want me to admit, right?” She caught herself raising her voice. I couldn’t blame her. She looked out at the crowd of people and took a breath. The laughing swelled in my ears.

“You want to try something else?” She wasn’t speaking to Debra anymore. “Go ahead. But I’m going to the library right now, and I’m locking the doors.” Debra said nothing. I think she wanted to be indignant. But even for crusty, old hard-asses like her, nobody wanted to be alone in the night.

The Sheriff locked the doors with a resounding click. We all huddled together in the meeting room, away from the windows. Most of us sat on the floor. People only spoke in whispers. Somehow, Ricky had coaxed Tom inside, who sobbed stains into the carpet for the rest of the night.

Within a minute, a crowd of creatures had pressed themselves into the glass, staring at us. Laughing. I didn’t see a single one drift further into the town. They were all fixated on the library.

Ricky, to his credit, stood separate from the group beside Nix, trying to take his responsibilities seriously. But I knew. He was only a couple of years older than me. I grew up with him. He was in over his head. We all were.

_Thump-thump._

Hours passed, and the sun set, turning the creatures into silhouettes against the windows. With each passing hour, a fire in my chest swelled. I was angry. Angry that these things had me sitting on the floor of the library. Angry that they had us all living in fear year after year, unable to leave. I was angry about what they did to Amy. Angry that they turned Tom into a useless drunk. Angry that Amy shot her child, and we were all too scared to feel it.

And I was angry about Ethan. My best friend, Amy’s firstborn, who died last year because these bastards changed the rules.

My attention broke back to my surroundings when a loud pop rang out against the large windows. One creature had smashed their fists against the window. Everyone jumped. Another creature followed suit. Soon, each one bashed their flesh against the windows. Hands, feet, knees, even their heads. The pops rang out like hail.

Beth’s hand found mine. We squeezed hard. Murmurs broke out in the crowd.

“Have they ever done that before?”

“Can the glass hold?”

_Thump-thump._

They changed the rules again.

People stood. Instinct moved us all further back from the window. Everyone except me. I gritted my teeth, jaw clenched. I took a step forward.

“What are you doing?” Beth pleaded with me. I broke my grasp from hers and took another step forward. I saw one creature meet my eyes.

Whether adrenaline, fear, or rage, my heart nearly beat out of my chest. My legs shook. Every muscle in my body begged to run. But I took another step forward. Then another, until I had pressed myself into the glass, staring eye to eye with the monstrosity only inches away on the other side.

“Come on, you fuckers.” I whispered.

All at once, the laughing and the banging stopped. The silence was deafening. One by one, the creatures turned and began a slow walk back beyond the horizon. One creature remained behind the rest. The one who started the banging. The one who now locked eyes with me.

“Caleb, come on.” I heard Beth's tender voice behind me. Her hand touched mine, and she soothed me away from the glass. The last creature turned and left.

The heartbeats finally faded. But mine was racing.

We waited an hour to see if they would return before Nix took the first step into the brisk night air. Eventually, everyone made it home. Everyone except me.

I had resolved myself hours ago. Truthfully, I had been thinking about it for a full year. It’s why I volunteered to take the janitor position at the Hub when I reached working age. I needed the keycard.

Cell signal and internet access in our town is restricted and monitored, and the Hub is the building that controls it. They don’t want anyone knowing about this place.

I had been studying it for months, catching glimpses and listening to conversations while pretending to change trash bags, but honestly, it wasn’t very hard to bypass the security on their systems. Old men never understand technology like the young.

And that’s where I am now, and where I’ll be every night that I survive, or until I’m caught.

The world needs to know what happens here.
