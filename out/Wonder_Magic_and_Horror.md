My mother believed in the supernatural. 

&#x200B;

She believed that there was so much more to this world than meets the eye… so much that we don’t understand. When I was a kid, she used to tell me about it. She raised me on stories of monsters, magic, and fae. Stories of things she’d seen, full of wonder and magic and horror. I was fascinated by them, and I’d believed them, even though I never saw any of it for myself. She always told me that I would someday, and I always believed her.

&#x200B;

I used to fantasize about being just like her, of researching the supernatural and peeling back the veil, right by her side. But… fate had other plans, I guess. 

&#x200B;

When the cancer hit, I originally tried to stay hopeful. I wanted to believe that she’d pull through. Sure, this was a raw deal but… I told myself that everything was going to be okay! Mom was doing fine! She was going to pull through! Things were going to turn around! But they didn’t.

&#x200B;

To her credit… she kept on smiling until the end. But that didn’t make it any easier to watch her die. And when she was gone, my world felt… well… darker. Growing up, everything had always felt so magical, but once she was gone, so was the magic.

&#x200B;

I was in school at the time, majoring in Evolutionary Biology at Upper Lake University in Tevam Sound… Mom had said that if I wanted to follow my dream of working side by side with her, *that* was the best place to study. She’d even taught there herself, once upon a time. But without that dream on the horizon, continuing on with my studies just felt… well… pointless. I went through the motions, sure. But I didn’t care the way I used to. Mom’s stories suddenly felt so much more hollow. The world didn’t feel magical, it felt mundane, and I started to wonder if the stories she’d once told me were ever true in the first place, or if they’d been just that. Stories.

&#x200B;

I tried to find solace in a few different places… girls, pot, parties, shots of dopamine to keep my mind off of my grief. But none of those really did much to help. At best, they were just a distraction, and at worst, they just made me hurt more. Still, it was all I had so… I kept on going, hoping that something might eventually change. 

&#x200B;

And funnily enough, it did.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I woke up with a mild hangover from a party I’d been at the night before. Sunlight streamed in through my curtains, coaxing me awake, although the girl beside me, Autumn remained fast asleep. 

&#x200B;

Autumn was admittedly just a fling. We’d hooked up a few times, but it wasn’t anything serious. She wasn’t the type of girl I usually went for… I've usually got a soft spot for girls who are a little rougher around the edges. But we both needed a rebound, and she was cute, with an adorable little button nose, kissable cheeks, and a smile that was hard to resist. I didn’t know how long we were going to keep doing this, but she was good company for the time being, especially after the dumpster fire that was my last relationship.

&#x200B;

Her leg brushed against mine. I rolled onto my side, looking over at her. She was still asleep. Her hair was a mess and I could see the hickeys trailing down her neck. I couldn’t help but admire them with quiet satisfaction, before sitting up slowly and stretching. My bedroom was, admittedly, kinda a mess. My bedside table was covered in all sorts of clutter. Books, empty bottles of gatorade, a glass pipe, deodorant. Then there were the clothes on the floor… more than just the ones from last night. I figured I should probably do something about that.

&#x200B;

I grabbed some comfy shorts and a tank top from the dresser before gathering my clothes off the floor and stuffing them in my hamper. I left Autumn’s clothes on the bed, before shuffling out of the bedroom and into the kitchen.

&#x200B;

My apartment wasn’t very big, but it was cozy and while I wasn’t going to be cooking any grand meals in that kitchen, I had enough space to make breakfast. I grabbed a clean pan and got to work. I had eggs, and I had bacon. Fantastic. 

&#x200B;

Autumn preferred her eggs over easy, so that’s how I made them. I put on a kettle for tea as well, while I blinked the sleep from my eyes and tried to get my bearings. It was Saturday, no class today, but I did have work in a few hours. 

&#x200B;

The eggs and bacon sizzled in the pan, filling my little one bedroom apartment with the most wonderful aroma while spitting hot oil at me. The white of the yolk was starting to look just about ready to flip, and the bacon was crisping to a perfect mahogany. 

&#x200B;

I flipped the eggs, then got out two mugs as the kettle boiled. Autumn liked Earl Gray tea. I preferred chai but didn't mind a compromise. In the next room, I could hear movement and wondered if the smell of breakfast had woken her up. 

&#x200B;

The eggs were done. So was the bacon, I killed the heat on the stove, before plating everything up. As I did, I couldn’t help but notice the flash of blue and red lights outside my window. 

&#x200B;

How long had that been there? That wasn’t new, was it?

&#x200B;

I paused to snoop. My apartment was on the third floor but had a good view of the street. I could see three police cars parked out front. What was that about? My mind immediately drifted to the pipe in my bedroom, although that stuff was legal these days. Even if it wasn't, I doubted the cops would show up just because I smoked a bowl last night. Something else was going on. Something more serious.

&#x200B;

I could hear movement out in the hall. Footsteps, voices. 

&#x200B;

Police.

&#x200B;

Were they on my floor?

&#x200B;

I paused, before deciding to take a peek out into the hall. I headed for the door and opened it just a crack. As soon as I did, I saw an officer walking past. He didn’t really pay any mind to me. He was heading for the door near the end of the hall. Wasn’t that Sarah Bond’s apartment? Was she in trouble? I admittedly didn’t know her very well. I knew she was a student at the University, just like I was (a lot of the people in this building were students, actually) and I knew that she ran with a shady crowd, but the few times we’d spoken to each other, she’d seemed alright to me. 

I could see a few other officers there waiting for him outside her door, although I couldn’t hear what they were talking about.

&#x200B;

I noticed another woman standing in the hall watching them, Anna James. Another student. Her golden blonde hair was fairly messy, indicating she’d probably just woken up too, although I don’t know what possessed her to think that stepping out of her apartment in a pair of cheetah print pajama bottoms was even remotely acceptable. Maybe I was being judgemental, but my ex cheated on me with her, so I think I was allowed to hate her guts a little. 

&#x200B;

Still - she was the only person in the hall aside from the cops, so I figured I might as well ask what was going on.

  “I don’t know,” Was her response. She adjusted her round glasses as she watched the police. “I guess someone heard screaming and called the cops?”

&#x200B;

  “Jesus, is she alright?”

  “I don’t know, I didn’t hear anything but…” Anna trailed off as the police quietly disappeared into Sarah’s apartment, leaving one officer out to make sure nobody got closer. Both of us stared uneasily at the door before deciding that we’d seen all there was to see.

&#x200B;

  “Guess we’ll find out one way or another…” Anna murmured before she quietly turned and headed back to her own apartment. After a few moments, I did the same. 

&#x200B;

I didn't know Sarah very well, but I couldn't help but be a little worried for her. Like I said, I knew she ran with a rough crowd. She and her friends were the kind of people you talked to if you wanted something a little harder than pot. But as far as I could tell, her rough crowd wasn’t really dangerous. Shady, yes. But not dangerous. Maybe this was about the drugs? Maybe she was getting busted or something? I honestly hoped that was just it. The idea of it being something else turned my stomach a little. I tried not to think about it as I went to check in on Autumn.

&#x200B;

She was awake, sitting up in my bed and checking her phone, draped in a blanket that conveniently didn’t cover much up.

  “Morning,” I said.

  “Morning.”

  “You hungry, I made breakfast.”

  “Mmm? Thank you.”

I brought in the plate for her and we sat on the bed together to eat. I didn’t tell her about what I saw out in the hall. I honestly just didn’t want to think about it.

&#x200B;

Everything was probably fine… Sarah probably had a bad trip or something, and the police had probably just come to check in on her and found her stash. Yeah… everything was probably fine.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

After Autumn left, I got ready for work. I’d been picking up shifts at a local cafe down the street just for some extra spending money. Mom’s estate covered my monthly rent, but I hated the idea of relying solely on that. I can’t say that the work was particularly exciting, but it was money.

&#x200B;

The cops had still been in Sarah’s apartment when I’d left. I tried not to think about that… although it still lingered in the back of my mind during my shift. And apparently, I wasn't the only one thinking about it.

&#x200B;

About halfway through my shift, a small group of girls had come in. I recognized one of them as another tenant in my building, although I didn’t know her name. I wasn’t trying to eavesdrop on anyone… but every now and then, I overheard snippets of people's conversations, especially when the cafe wasn’t all that busy, and when I heard them talking about what had happened to Sarah, I couldn’t help but listen in.

&#x200B;

  *“Yeah, my brother was at the scene… he said it was a mess.”*

  *“What happened?”*

  *“They don’t know! They just found the place trashed! Nobody saw anything, some of the neighbors just heard screams and some kind of struggle!”*

&#x200B;

A struggle? I felt a quiet unease in my stomach. Maybe something really had happened to Sarah?

&#x200B;

  *“Did they find anything?”* One of the girls asked.

  *“I heard they found some blood, but that was it.”*

  *“She was a druggie, right? I heard she was friends with Amber. Maybe that had something to do with it?”*

  *“Maybe? But it’s still weird that she just vanished like that! If she was dead, how would you even get the body out?”*

&#x200B;

My mind drifted back to some of my Mom’s old stories… specifically the ones about monsters, stalking people and spiriting them away. This couldn’t have anything to do with that, could it? Although now that the thought was in my head, it was hard to get it out… and now I couldn’t think of anything but the crime scene in Sarah’s apartment for the rest of my shift.

&#x200B;

When I finally left that evening, Sarah’s apartment was still on my mind. As I headed back to my own apartment, I couldn’t help but pause at my door and stare down the hall. The police were gone but had left tape up over her door. 

&#x200B;

My hand rested over my doorknob, but the pull to investigate was hard to resist. What harm would taking a quick peek do? I wasn’t going to touch anything… I was just going to look.

&#x200B;

Before I could stop myself, I was walking down the hall to Sarah’s door. I found it unlocked. I hesitated for a moment, before opening it, and gingerly ducking under the police tape. Sarah’s apartment was a mess… and unlike mine, it wasn’t a *lived in* mess. It looked like there’d been a brawl in there… furniture was overturned or broken, the television in the living room had been cracked… and then there was the blood. A smeared trail of it… leading down the hall.

&#x200B;

The sight of it made me freeze. It looked almost like somebody had been *dragged* down the hall, toward the bathroom at the end. I hesitated for a moment, before stepping over the blood and making my way over to the bathroom to investigate. My heart raced uneasily in my chest. I paused outside of the bathroom door before quietly pushing it open.

&#x200B;

The trail continued inside… only it moved up onto the counter and stopped at the mirror. I followed it with my eyes, before looking up at my reflection. The woman staring back at me looked like me… but seemed off somehow. Staring at it felt… wrong.

&#x200B;

I took a step back and left the bathroom. I’d seen enough.

&#x200B;

Mom’s old monster stories lingered in my mind… and it was hard to deny how similar this was to them. In those stories of hers, the cases were never solved. Or at least, not by the police. You can’t arrest a monster, after all.

You need someone else to deal with it.

Fortunately, I had someone in mind.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Mom always used to speak fondly about Dr. Caroline Vega. She’d met her during her time teaching at the University, and supposedly she was something of an expert on the occult. Mom had even consulted her as a source for her own research back in the day, and I figured that if anyone might be able to make sense of what I’d seen at Sarah’s apartment, it would be her. 

&#x200B;

I’d only met Dr. Vega a handful of times myself, and I wouldn’t exactly say I knew her well, but I’d been to her house with Mom so I knew where to find her.

&#x200B;

Dr. Vega’s house was in the nicer, more suburban side of Tevam Sound and even then it stood out from the houses around it thanks to its garden. It flourished around the house, making it look like something out of a fairy tale. Flowers of all colors blossomed in tiered terraces by the steps leading up to her front door and vibrant ivy crawled up her red brick walls. I knocked on the door, and after a moment it was answered by a man I didn’t recognize.

&#x200B;

  “Hi, I’m looking for Dr. Vega?” I asked.

He gave a nod.

  “Oh, yeah she’s out back. Are you here for the Summer Solstice feast?”

  “Um… no? I just wanted to pick her brain about something.”

&#x200B;

He nodded.

  “Yeah, I’ll go and get her. Come on in.”

He gestured for me to follow him into the house.

&#x200B;

Vega’s home was a hell of a lot more cluttered than the pristine garden out front might suggest, although I’m not sure if I’d call it messy. Books were abandoned on tables, and every surface either had a potted plant or a trinket on it. Sometimes there was even more than one. Still, this place had a sort of warm, welcoming atmosphere to it and there was a pleasant aroma of something delicious wafting through the air. This place felt homey… comfortable, even. The man led me through the cluttered halls, toward a small sunny parlor.

&#x200B;

  “I’ll let Caroline know she’s got a visitor!” He said, smiling at me before taking off. I watched him go, before quietly looking around.

The parlor had a similar atmosphere to the rest of the house although something about it felt different. It was almost like stepping into a chapel of some sort. I stood by the window, looking out at the garden behind the house. It was vibrant and breathtaking, almost putting the one out front to shame. Someone had clearly poured a lot of love into every hour of its cultivation, and I could see a small gathering of strangers around a table far in the back. Among them, I spotted Dr. Vega herself, smiling as she spoke to those around her.

&#x200B;

Then I heard a familiar voice behind me, speaking my name.

  “Justice?”

&#x200B;

I turned suddenly, to see a woman with shaggy, dirty blonde hair stepping out of a room behind me… a study, from the looks of it. She was dressed in a dark blue striped top, with a pale crystal necklace. I noticed that she was holding a crimson leather bound book, that she gingerly set down on the table beside her.

  “Temperance…” I said softly.

&#x200B;

I hadn’t actually seen her since we’d broken up… although she was looking better than she had been a few months back. 

  “What are you doing here?” She asked.

  “I… just had some questions for Dr. Vega,” I said. “What are you doing here?”

  “Summer Solstice feast,” She said, before realizing that wasn’t a great explanation. “Dr. Vega’s been helping me get back on the straight and narrow… I’m clean now, actually! One whole month now.” 

  “That’s good…” I said, still a little distracted. 

  “Yeah… feels good,” Temperance said. “You’re looking pretty good too!”

  “Thanks..."

  “You been seeing anyone lately?” 

&#x200B;

There was another underlying question there… one that I wasn’t sure how I wanted to answer.

  “Nothing serious” I admitted. 

  “Yeah… me neither. Did you want to maybe…”

  “No.”

&#x200B;

The answer came instantly.

  “No, I don’t think I…”

  “Yeah, that’s fair!” Temperance said, forcing a smile. “Look… I know I said I’m sorry but… it really was just a one time thing. I really am trying to turn it around!”

  “It wasn’t the cheating, Tempe…” I said softly. “I mean… that hurt, but we could’ve worked through that. It was everything else. There’s a clear line between getting a buzz and getting so fucked up you don’t even know who or where you are. You crossed it. You crossed it almost every fucking day, and I don’t think you realize how *scary* that was for me! Watching you go out with Amber and getting so high you couldn’t even stand, wondering how long it was going to take before you finally killed yourself. I kept waiting for the day I’d wake up, and find out that you’d OD’d beside me… I couldn’t do that. *I couldn’t*.”

&#x200B;

She nodded solemnly.

  “I get that,” She said softly. “But I’m getting better! Amber won’t be a problem anymore!”

I couldn’t help but narrow my eyes at that. The way she said it… like her junkie friends were the problem, and not her. That didn’t sit right with me.

&#x200B;

  “Well… I’m glad to hear that,” I said although the words felt insincere. “I’m happy for you.”

I heard movement in the hall and turned to see Dr. Vega stepping into the room with us. She carried two cups of tea with her.

  “Sorry to keep you waiting!” She said gently, before noticing Temperance. “Oh… am I interrupting?”

  “It’s fine… I was just on my way out!” Temperance said, before quietly leaving. Vega watched her go, before offering me one of the cups of tea.

&#x200B;

  “Well, well, Justice Young… it’s been a while since I’ve seen you!”

  “Sorry to just drop in,” I said. “It looks like you were in the middle of something.”

  “Oh, don’t you worry about it. Just a little get together. A few of my students have taken a certain interest in the Old Faith, and I guess I feel obligated to host some events so we can all get together.”

  “Sounds nice,” I said.

  “It’s lovely, you’re welcome to stay if you’d like!”

&#x200B;

If Temperance wasn’t there… I might’ve been tempted to say yes.

  “I appreciate it, but I really can’t stay.”

  “That’s fine! Why don’t we get down to business, then? What brings you to me?”

&#x200B;

Vega sat down in one of the plush loveseats across from the window, and I chose to sit down across from her.

  “There was an incident at my apartment the other day,” I said. “A girl disappeared. I know it’s technically none of my business, but I overheard some people talking about what happened and… well, it sounded kinda like the things Mom used to research.”

  “So you’ve been looking into it yourself?” Vega asked.

&#x200B;

I gave a hesitant nod. 

  “I took a look at the crime scene,” I admitted. “Something’s off, there… there was a trail of blood leading to the mirror. Almost like the girl… Sarah… was dragged there.”

Vega nodded.

  “I’ve seen the photos,” She said. “I have a friend with the local police who checks in with me every time he comes across something strange. He was just here this morning about the second attack.”

&#x200B;

  “There was a second victim?” I asked, my heart sinking a little.

  “Victims. Plural. It was just this morning. Similar M.O. Neighbors heard a struggle and screams… and police found a trail of blood, leading to the mirror. It’s troubling, to say the least.”

  “Do you have any idea what it might be?” I asked.

  “Yes and no. Odds are it’s some form of Grovewalker, but I can’t be certain about more than that.”

&#x200B;

Grovewalker… I’d heard the term before. Mom had always described them as twisted, otherworldly demons.

  “I told my friend that the best thing to do would be to figure out how the victims are connected. The way I see it, there’s two possible reasons why they’re being targeted. The first is that they somehow provoked something, in which case we’d need to find out how, and who else was involved.”

  “And the second?” I asked.

&#x200B;

  “The second is that someone is *using* the Grovewalker to hunt them down. Either way, there’s some sort of connection between the victims, and the only way to save any of them is to figure out what it is.”

  “Is there anything I can do to help you look?” I asked.

  “Honestly, it might be best to leave this to the proper people,” Vega said. “I’ve had a chat with one of your mother's former colleagues this morning, he’s sending someone out to look into all of this.”

&#x200B;

  “And how long is that going to take…?” I asked.

  “I’d expect he’ll be here by tomorrow.”

  “If there’s been two victims in two days, couldn’t someone else be dead by then?”

&#x200B;

Vega hesitated, before giving a half nod.

  “It’s very likely…” She said, “If I knew where to start looking, I’d probably be out there seeing if I could figure out the connection myself.”

  “Well maybe I can help?” I asked. “Who exactly was the second victim? Do you know?”

  “A girl and her boyfriend, Amber Cane and Martin Williams.”

&#x200B;

Those names sent a chill through me. I recognized them.

&#x200B;

Vega studied my expression for a moment, her eyes narrowing slightly.

  “You knew them?”

  “Not really… but she was friends with my ex. Temperance knew her.”

  “I see… one of her old friends?”

&#x200B;

I nodded.

  “Interesting. I’ll have to pick her brain about that. Do you know anyone else who was part of that group?”

  “There’s another friend of theirs in my building,” I said. “Anna. I don’t think she knew Sarah… the first victim all that well, but I know she was friends with Amber.”

  “Was she? It may be worth having a talk with her, then,” Vega said. 

  “I can reach out,” I said. 

&#x200B;

Vega nodded and took a sip of her tea, regarding me with a quiet uncertainty. 

  “It would be helpful,” She said. “You’ll likely have an easier time talking to her than I would. But you do understand that by getting involved, you’re taking on a considerable risk yourself, don’t you?”

&#x200B;

I nodded back at her.

  “Yeah,” I admitted. “But it’s what Mom would’ve done, isn’t it?”

She cracked a dry smile.

  “Yes… that or pouring over every book I have, trying to learn more on the subject. Speaking of which, if you’re going to talk to this Anna girl, the least I can do is handle the research. Hopefully we’ll at least know what we’re dealing with by the time your mothers old colleagues make it here.”

  “Sounds like a plan,” I said, before finally taking a sip of my tea. “I’ll check in with you as soon as I’ve talked to her.”

 “Please do. I’ll be in touch as well. If I find anything in my books, I’ll give you a call.”

&#x200B;

That settled it.

For a moment, I felt a rise of anxiety in my chest. It briefly occurred to me that I didn’t have much of an idea of what I was getting myself into… but I couldn’t just do nothing. Mom would’ve wanted to help. That was the kind of person she was, and that was the kind of person I wanted to be.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

It was mid afternoon by the time I made it home, although I didn’t bother going to my apartment. Instead I went and knocked on Anna’s door. 

&#x200B;

I’d been trying to figure out how to get into Amber’s death with her. Our relationship was pretty civil considering the fact that she’d fucked my ex, but we weren’t exactly friends. Showing up and asking about what had happened with Sarah and Amber might not go over well if I didn’t handle the approach right. Actually, truth be told, I wasn’t even sure if she knew about Amber yet and if that was the case, I wanted to at least try to break the news to her gently. By the time I knocked on her door, I’d planned out most of the conversation in my head and I figured that if I was lucky, it would all go according to plan.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately - I’ve never really been a lucky girl before. 

&#x200B;

When I knocked the first time, Anna didn’t answer.

&#x200B;

She didn’t answer after the second knock either.

&#x200B;

I caught myself wondering if maybe she wasn’t home… but I was pretty sure I’d seen her car out back. Maybe she’d gone out drinking instead? Or maybe she was just passed out on her couch, baked out of her gourd? There were a million completely logical reasons why she wasn’t answering!

&#x200B;

But considering what had happened to Amber and Sarah, I couldn’t help but wonder at a darker possibility. And the longer I stood in the hall, the more I contemplated that darker possibility. What if something had happened to her? What if she’d become the next victim? That thought lingered in my mind, unwilling to go away.

&#x200B;

I had to find out for sure… 

&#x200B;

I’ve had my share of misadventures while drunk, and gotten locked out of my apartment once or twice. I learned how to pick the lock, and it wasn't hard to pick the lock on Anna’s door. I figured that if I got caught, I could just lie and say I’d found it unlocked in the first place. The door clicked, and I pushed it open. The apartment was dead silent… but there was no obvious sign of a struggle. Everything seemed relatively normal. The TV was even on, playing old music videos on YouTube. 

&#x200B;

I noticed a hell of a setup spread out on her coffee table, and stepped closer to examine it. Empty cans of coolers were scattered around with spent syringes beside them. I didn’t know for sure what had been in the syringes, but if I had to guess, I’d say it was G. That had been Temperance's drug of choice. Clearly she’d been using recently. Maybe she was still home?

&#x200B;

I glanced down the hall, toward the bedroom, and made my way toward it. Her bedroom door was open, and I hesitated for a moment before peeking inside.

&#x200B;

What I saw there turned my blood to ice. 

&#x200B;

The sheets were stained with blood… enough of it that I knew Anna was dead. But there was no body to be found. Instead, there was simply a trail of blood leading to her bedroom vanity and ending at the mirror. Whatever had killed her must have taken her in her sleep… I could see her round glasses on her bedside table, spattered with dried blood. Maybe she was lucky enough not to wake up… maybe.

&#x200B;

My hands were shaking as I stumbled back out of the room, staring into it as my heart raced. My breath felt shaky and uneven. Whatever this thing was… it’d claimed its fourth victim, and judging by the color of the blood, Anna had been dead for a while. 

&#x200B;

It was killing more frequently.

&#x200B;

Vega *needed* to know about this…

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

  “So that’s four now…” Vega said gravely, as I broke the news to her. She sat in front of the window in her study, lit from behind by dying twilight. I noticed a few books on her desk, occult tomes detailing demons of every ilk.

  “Four that we know about,” I said. Vega’s expression soured.

  “You didn’t find anything at the scene?”

  “I didn’t really go poking around! That’s going to be an active crime scene! I don’t want the police knocking on my door!”

&#x200B;

  “Right… I’m sorry," she said. “I don’t suppose you know anyone else in that group?”

  “They were Temperance’s friends, not mine.” I said. “We could try asking her? Is she still here?”

  “I’ve already spoken to her about this. According to her, it’s been over a month since she’s been in touch with any of the victims. I’m not sure how much help she’ll be.”

  “Well I still want to ask her,” I said. “Is she still here?”

  “She left with the others earlier,” Dr. Vega said. 

&#x200B;

  “You just let her leave?”

  “She’ll be okay. I’ve been teaching her a thing or two while she’d been trying to get clean. Protective charms, and the like. Unless we’re dealing with a very high level entity it should be more than sufficient.”

I didn’t really like that answer, but she *was* the expert, so I wasn’t in much of a position to question it.

&#x200B;

  “In the meanwhile, I’ve been digging through a few old demonology tomes of mine,” She continued, getting up and picking up a crimson leather bound book. “I might’ve found something promising.”

  “You know what this thing is?” I asked hopefully, as I moved to look at the pages over her shoulder.

  “I think so. It’s a low tier Grovewalker, as I suspected. If we could draw it out, we might even be able to kill it.”

  “You can kill it?” I asked.

  “With the right curse, yes.” She said, “It wouldn’t take long to create a weapon that can harm it.”

&#x200B;

  “So then all we need to do is find it?” I asked. 

  “That’d be extremely risky.” She said, “These things are dangerous, Justice.”

  “It’s already killed four people and odds are it’s going to kill again,” I said. “If we can do something about that, we *should!* We have to!”

  “I agree, but we don’t know *why* it’s targeting these people. There’s any number of things that can draw a Grovewalker to a person. Chance encounters, mental or emotional state, or deliberate invocation. If we don’t know how to find it, there’s not much we can do about it.”

&#x200B;

I glanced down at the page, hoping that somehow the text on it might make more sense to me… it didn’t. Although my eyes were still drawn to something. The red leather cover of the book. I could just see the edge of it on the table, I frowned, before reaching out for it and partially closing it so I could read the front.

&#x200B;

*Liber Inferni.*

&#x200B;

  “What are you doing?” Vega asked.

  “Where did you get this?” I asked.

  “I don’t see how that’s relevant, but I have a friend who-”

  “No, I mean… today. When you picked this book up today, where did you find it? Was it in the parlor?”

  “Yes?”

  “But you don’t usually keep it there, do you?”

&#x200B;

She paused.

  “No, I try to keep most of my advanced books in here… operative word being try… I really should go through and-”

  “Temperance was reading this…” I said, and Vega trailed off. 

  “Excuse me?”

  “I saw her when we were talking in the parlor earlier, I saw her come out of your study and she was holding *this* book!”

  “You’re certain…?” She asked. “Justice if you’re saying what I think you’re saying, that’s a *serious* accusation.”

  “I know what I saw,” I said. “She was carrying *this* book! Why would she be reading this book? And then there’s what she said to me about Amber… she said she *‘wasn’t going to be a problem anymore.’*”

&#x200B;

I trailed off.

&#x200B;

No… no… I didn’t want to believe this. But the pieces fit together so well. Amber and her friends had been the ones who’d introduced Temperance to G. They’d been the ones she was buying it from… they were the ones she was usually getting high with. And the way she’d spoken about Amber when I’d run into her: “*Amber won’t be a problem anymore!”*

&#x200B;

That phrasing had bothered me. Now it terrified me.

&#x200B;

Vega was silent and slowly closed the book.

  “I need a minute to make some preparations,” She said. “After that… I think we need to have a chat with Temperance.”

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Temperance’s apartment was a few streets away from mine.   
It was night when Vega and I arrived there. I stood behind her, watching as she pounded on Temperance’s door. I glanced at the long silver dagger in her hand, partially hidden up her sleeve. She’d been carrying it with her when she’d left her study after her *‘preparations.’*

*“The curse on this dagger should kill it,”* She’d said. I hoped that she was right.

&#x200B;

I could hear movement on the other side of the door before Temperance opened it.

  “Dr. Vega? What’s going o-”

&#x200B;

Vega cut her off by pushing through her door, her expression almost uncharacteristically cold. 

  “Four of your old friends are dead, Temperance… you wanna explain that to me?”

  “I didn’t…” She trailed off when she saw me, standing in the doorway and I could see the gears in her head slowly starting to turn.

  “You read the *Liber Inferni*, didn’t you? You used it. Tell me I’m wrong.”

&#x200B;

Temperance was silent.

  *“Tell me I’m wrong!”*

After a moment, she just cracked a sheepish smile.

  “I just… I was curious about some stuff," she said. “Come on, I only looked at it earlier today… didn’t Sarah and Amber die before that?”

&#x200B;

Vega wasn’t convinced. I pushed forward and slipped Temperance’s phone out of her pocket. She tried to stop me, but I was faster. I still remembered her lock screen password and opened up her camera roll. Sure enough… there were photographs in there of pages from the book Vega had been reading. Some of them from today, some from almost a week ago. I looked over at Vega, before showing her the photos. She studied them, before looking at Temperance with a silent horror.

  “What have you done…?” She asked, her voice trembling slightly.

  “It’s not like they didn’t have it coming!” Temperance finally said. “You both know what kind of people they were! You both know what they did to me!”

&#x200B;

  “Amber didn’t put a fucking gun to your head, Tempe! You *chose* to do that shit, over and over again you *chose* it!” I snapped.

  “And now I’m *choosing* to fix it!” Temperance said. “Justice… come on… I’m doing better! And no one’s going to miss them! It’s better this way! You can see that, right?”

&#x200B;

Vega and I just stared at her, as her expression slowly darkened.

  “You see it… right?” She repeated.

  “Whatever you’ve set up to control this thing, I’m taking it down…” Vega said softly, pushing past her to sweep the apartment. “Then we’ll figure out how to deal with you…”

  “No!” Temperance cried, grabbing her by the arm. “I’m not done with it yet, there’s still a few more! I need to finish it! *I need to finish it!”*

&#x200B;

Vega shrugged her off, pushing her aside.

*“I’M finishing it!”* She hissed, glaring into Temperance’s eyes.

&#x200B;

Temperance glared back at her, and I saw her hand go to her necklace.

  “Not until I’m done…” She said softly, *“NOT UNTIL I’M DONE!”*

In the next room, I could hear the thud of something moving. Something crashing to the ground. Vega and I both froze, as Temperance scrambled back.

  “I’m sorry Dr. Vega…” She said, her hand still on her necklace. “But I can’t let you get in the way!”

&#x200B;

The thing in the next room moved, and after a moment, I saw a shape stumble out of her bedroom and into the hall. Up until then… I’d never seen any of the things Mom had told me about in her stories. But now that I was looking right at one, all I could feel was a primal terror.

&#x200B;

I’m not entirely sure how to even describe it… it was simply a dark collection of limbs and flesh. I thought I could see faces among its undulating mass, and for a moment I could’ve sworn those faces resembled the dead. Amber, Sarah, Anna… others…

&#x200B;

I took a step back away from that *thing,* as Vega drew her knife, eyes fixated on it.

  “No!” Temperance said the moment she saw the knife. She must’ve known the threat it posed. “No, you *can’t!”* She lunged for Vega, slamming her into the wall and trying to wrestle the knife from her as the shape advanced. I could only stand rooted to the spot as she and Vega struggled for the knife. Temperance grabbed it, before slamming her head against Vega’s and ripping the knife out of her grasp.

&#x200B;

I had to move… I had to do *something!*

&#x200B;

I glanced at the necklace Temperance wore… and without thinking, I grabbed at it, ripping it off of her neck. Temperance’s eyes went wide, she looked at me, her expression one of shock and betrayal.

  “No!” She cried, “Justice, wait…”

&#x200B;

Vega squirmed out from beneath her, and stumbled away, while Temperance turned to face the entity shambling toward her. She tried to back away… but it moved faster than she did, dragging itself forward with its countless hands, reaching out for her and grabbing her.

&#x200B;

Temperance screamed.

&#x200B;

She fought.

&#x200B;

She cried.

&#x200B;

But the arms just held her tight as they began to pull at her… taking her apart as her screams echoed through the halls. I watched in horror as she was slowly pulled apart by arms that dragged her pieces into the creature's mass… devouring her in a sense.

Part of me wanted to help her… to save her.

But I already knew she’d been past my help for a while now.

&#x200B;

Vega grabbed me, forcing me to look away from what was happening. But I could still hear Temperance’s screams. And despite what she did… despite who she chose to be, I don’t think I’ll ever stop hearing those screams.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

After a ‘*police investigation*’, the deaths of Sarah, Amber and Anna were officially given the mundane but not inaccurate label of ‘homicides’ and the official story wasn’t all that far from the truth. Temperance had murdered three of the girls she used to party with while high, blaming them for the downward spiral her life had taken. Her death was ruled as a suicide driven by guilt… but I knew better.

&#x200B;

I let Dr. Vega and my Mom’s old colleagues clean up the mess the demon had left. They knew how to do it properly… but I did try and keep an eye on them from a distance. I figured I might learn a thing or two by watching.

&#x200B;

The stories Mom used to tell me were always full of magic and wonder. I always knew that there was danger, death and horror weaved into the. But she focused on the positives. Having caught a glimpse of the horrors that lurked behind the veil, I think I can finally understand why. It’s best not to think about those things too much, if you can help it.

&#x200B;

Still… though what I experienced that night shook me to my core, there was still some good to come out of it. I finally got to see the world Mom had told me so much about… the one full of wonder, magic, and horror. And now that I’d seen the horror… I couldn’t wait to see the rest.
