I need yinz to know that when I typed out the title of this one, I had the most self-satisfied smirk on my face. Normally, I don't like the idea of having to hurt someone, human or otherwise, but it felt good to finally give it back to that bastard.  

Don't worry, we'll get there. But first things first: the clerk of courts. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

I won't disclose the name of the village my apartment is located in. Yes, *village.* That’s how small it is. One of those little blink-and-you-miss-it areas with only a Dollar General and a Dairy Queen to let you know that the outdated buildings are still inhabited. Anyone from the rural midwest knows of at least three places just like this.

It's located just outside the limits of the suburban area that makes up the highest volume of Orion's calls. Victor learned from an employee at the clerk of courts that it is horribly underfunded and due to that, there are still a lot of paper records that have yet to be digitized. They really fell behind after covid, so they've been trying to scan things in from as far back as 2020. Since I moved here from Pitt three years ago, mine should still be on paper. The question was if we could get to them before the mechanic could ~~without getting arrested in the process.~~

Luckily, I found out that Victor can turn into a cat. 

While I was staying with him, he'd taken the couch, offering me the bed despite me saying that I didn't care either way. Because of his condition, he can't salt off his entire apartment, so we secured the hall leading up to the bedroom and windows, leaving the front door open so that he could take care of any potential blood cravings. Just to be extra safe, I also salted the bedroom door. 

Even though I felt more secure knowing that I wasn't alone, I still had trouble sleeping. The exhaustion was starting to get to me; I'd had a headache behind my left eye that refused to go away and my appetite was gone. It felt like I was living in slow motion. 

The morning after the mechanic brutalized my father, I discovered a fluffy black cat sitting on the middle cushion, paw resting on an open book to keep the pages from turning. 

Initially, I didn't make the connection. In my defense, I was exhausted. There are a few Neighbors that can take the form of felines, so at first, I thought it could be one of them. Did one somehow get past him through the front door?

“Hey, there kitty!” I cooed, keeping my suspicions out of my voice, putting my palm out for it to sniff. 

The cat raised its head and glared at me. 

I recognized that icy gaze instantly. No one gets as annoyed with me as Victor does. 

I raised my hands at him. “You didn't think to mention this?”  

The cat grumbled before trotting off down the hall. Shortly after, Victor stalked into the room, tying a bandana around his permanently slit throat. 

“I didn't mention it because I just learned about it myself.” He explained. 

“When?”

“About three days ago. Figured it wasn't thrilling enough to make a fuss about it.”

*How in the hell is turning into a cat not ‘thrilling?’*

“Okay, Vic, hold on. I remember reading about draugr being able to grow to the size of a barn. Are you able to do that? Or shrink to be as small as a mouse?”

“As far as I know, only emotionally.” He replied flatly. 

To summarize the rest of that conversation, he'd been testing himself for a while to learn more about what he'd become. So far, it's been easier said than done, especially since he's been busy balancing his obligations to the Hunt with his regular duties at Orion. 

He'd figured out about the cat thing after meditating for the first time. He said he'd felt the need to clear his head and thought that it couldn't hurt to give mindfulness a whirl. Next thing he knew, he was on four legs. When I'd caught him reading, that had been his way of training himself to hold onto that mindfulness while distractions were in place.  

Yinz may be wondering, ‘What does this have to do with the clerk of courts?’ 

Reyna distracted the tired receptionist with some pressing questions about a marriage license. He didn't even notice that a cat trotted past him after Reyna set her backpack on the ground. 

After she was certain that the boss hadn't been discovered, she joined me where I waited in her car outside. It was the only vehicle that the mechanic wouldn't easily recognize if he made a move. 

Fidgety, she pulled down the visor, looking unnerved with her own reflection. Her facial injuries looked a lot better. By this point, most of the scratches had healed to thin, dark lines around her eyes that seemed like they'd disappear completely within a few more weeks. However, the one that went from her eyebrow to the bridge of her nose looked like it was there to stay.  

Speaking from experience, facial scarring does take some time to get used to. Reyna quickly shut the mirror. 

With an anxious huff, Reyna commented, “Now, I don't want to bring this energy into the world, but if Psycho Mantis shows up… what then?”

“By this time, he should still be at his shop,” I replied, “But if he decides to drop by, I'll find some way to keep him out. He won't resist the chance to try to fuck with me.”

Reyna looked concerned. “Won't that make things worse?”

I sighed heavily, “Probably. It'll be even more of a nightmare if he finds my name, though. I'll take a few minutes of psychological torment over an eternity of it any day.”

For the record, I don't know if the poor souls trapped in the trees are there forever or if they someday fade away, but my point still stands. The mechanic was going to continue to try breaking me down regardless of my behavior. 

She shuddered, “Well, when you put it that way…”

There was movement at one of the clerk of court's open windows. A little black paw was waving through it. Reyna jumped out of the car, glancing around, looking suspicious as hell. When she got to the window, she stood on tiptoes, reaching in, retrieving a Manila envelope first, then sliding it into her backpack. Then she grabbed Victor, cradling him awkwardly as if acutely aware that he was her boss. He looked equally as unenthused to be held. 

In other words, his impression of a regular cat is pretty convincing. 

Reyna's eyes suddenly got big, then she sprinted back to the Monte Carlo, shoving both the cat and the backpack at me. Victor let out an irritated meow as he hit my lap abruptly. She started the car and zoomed off as if we'd just robbed a bank. 

When I made a comment about it, she told me to look behind us. Blue truck. It was coming down the road. As it approached the clerk of courts, its blinker turned on.

I shivered. We'd *just* missed him. I stared into the mirror, expecting him to turn around and pursue us at any second; our exit was *extremely* suspicious, and if he recognized us, it wouldn't be hard to deduce what we'd been there for.

The mechanic got out and simply waltzed into the building, most likely to enchant the poor receptionist into handing my life over to him. He hadn't recognized us. 

We'd gotten *very* lucky. *I'd* gotten lucky. One minute later on our end, and he would've had my name.  

Reyna said what we were all thinking, “That was way too close.”

All I could do was nod. We were all on edge the entire ride to Reyna's apartment. 

I searched through the envelope, worried that something was missing. Change of address. Military discharge. Voting registration. Tax documents. It looked like it was all there, but my nerves were convincing me that something was left behind. I double and triple checked.  

*It's all there, try to calm down.* 

We made it to Reyna's apartment without issue, instantly salting the door the moment we were all inside. 

Victor was back to normal, trying to convince Fireball to come close enough to be pet. The skunk wasn't sure about him.  While Reyna dug through her hall closet, I checked yet again to make sure everything was there. She eventually waved me over to reveal a safe that she had hidden behind all of the coats. 

We stored my records into it, placing salt around the folder as well as the other documents Reyna had saved. Our hope was that since the mechanic didn't know as much as her, her apartment would be the last place he'd look. And even if he did find out, he wouldn't be able to reach them.  

Once that was completed, Reyna announced that she had half a bottle of strawberry margarita mix. Victor doesn't drink, so she and I split his share. Between the cheap, tasy alcohol, the comfort of their company, and watching Fireball trot around with her poofy tail in the air, I slowly felt the tight knot in my chest begin to loosen. 

My name was as secure as it could be, for the moment. That was one less thing to worry about.  

I should also mention that I'd called my mom the night my father was slain. ‘Killed’ seems like too mild of a word to describe what happened to him. I had been in the midst of panic when she'd answered. 

She knows about Orion's services and as someone that grew up around the atypical, she initially tried to dissuade me from taking the job. Back then, I'd assured her that we only deal with less malicious Neighbors, citing the Housekeeper infestation I told yinz about before. And normally, that's true. 

When I told Mom about what happened to the sperm donor, she was speechless. After she recovered from the shock, she assured me that she never stopped her practice of salting her home, thanks to stories from Grandma. She also promised to carry a container of it with her and to locate some iron to defend herself, if it came down to it. 

I described the mechanic to her so that she'd know what to look out for, also warning her to avoid his eyes. And if she heard a banjo or any other stringed instrument to get as far away from it as possible. 

“Well… no more country bars for me, I guess.” She quipped, her default way of coping with stress. 

Mom was reasonably nervous, though she said it was more for me than for herself. 

“Don't worry about me, Nessa,” She began. “You just get yourself out of this alive, alright?”

“Will do, Mom.”

After a moment, she then added, “Please be careful. I… don't know what I'd do if I lost you.”

That last bit made me cry. I heard her sniff from the other end. 

I feel terrible that I put her in this position. I don't know what other measures I could've taken to prevent this scenario, but there must've been something I've missed.

No matter what, I have to stay alive. Not just for my sake, but for hers. After all that she went through to take care of me, I owe her that much.

And the last thing I want is for that bastard to have the satisfaction of killing me. I'll stay alive out of spite, if I have to. 

On the night of the full moon, I went to look for the church alone, even though every instinct screamed that it was a bad idea. Unfortunately, the terms of the bet were that Reyna and Victor couldn't interfere with my search for the mechanic's name, so I wasn't left with much of a choice.  Before I went, I let them know what I was doing and scheduled a text to be sent out automatically at a certain time just in case something went wrong.

With the shotgun secured to my back, and the iron poker attached to my belt, I was as ready as I was ever going to be. 

After some time driving around the lake, I discovered a large stone structure poking out from the edge of the water. The moment my gaze fell upon its ruined steeple, my chest became cold. 

My first thought was that the church wasn't hungry for me. It only offered salvation to the wicked, and I was not fit for consumption. 

But why did I think that? Where did that come from? 

The lake was eerily quiet. No frogs, crickets, nothing. Even the wind was silent. The water was still, as if frozen in time. It was like the entire forest knew that this church didn't belong and was doing its best to avoid it. The arched doorway, located by the base of the steeple, gaped like an open mouth, seeming to swallow what little light was available. The doors looked to have disappeared long ago. 

The moonlight created a trail right up to the entrance. With a deep breath, I stepped forward, surprised to find that the water was far more shallow than I'd thought. By the time I got close enough to the church to peer into the doorway, it reached my knees. 

Even though the entryway was within arm’s reach, I still couldn't see inside. I retrieved my flashlight from my toolbelt; it did nothing to alleviate the darkness. 

With another sigh, I passed through the doorway. In pitch blackness, I trudged through knee-deep water until I was greeted by dim, gray candlelight. The small flames surrounded an antlered statue depicting the White Son of Mist, his head tilted, hand reaching out as if beckoning. The candles all bore those strange, gray flames, reflecting eerily in the dark water flooding the church. On the wall behind the statue were tendrils of what I thought were vines at first, but once my eyes adjusted, turned out to be black thorns. They twitched. Every once in a while, the pulsing would reveal torn flesh encased in the plant’s coils.

Against my will, one of the mechanic's memories came to mind: *black thorns drink the blood of the unworthy.*

I shuddered, looking away from the thorns. The ledger. I had to find it, then get the hell out of this place. My hagstone had remained still this whole time, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that something just as bad if not worse than the mechanic was in that church somewhere. 

I waded through to the first door that I saw to the statue's right. Even though I'm *certain* I saw its head turn to look at me in the reflection of the water, when I glanced back at it, it hadn't appeared to move. Its reflection was back to normal as well. 

I know what I saw. And I know from experience that the Hunt loves to fuck with people's heads. 

I entered the room to find what looked like a dining hall. The air was heavy with the musk of lavender, tinged with the metallic stench of blood. Shining the flashlight around, there were rows of tables set up, illuminated by more ghostly candles. On shining platters, fresh viscera was served, topped with the small purple petals of lavender flowers as a garnish. 

Here's another thing yinz need to know about the Neighbors: *never* eat their food. Otherworldly feasts will rob you of all earthly pleasures, without the love and comfort of food or family, trapped somewhere between life and death. However, it should also be noted that outright refusal of a Neighbor's hospitality is an egregious offense. 

Don't eat the food, but be clever about it.  

On the subject of the Hunters’ feast, I’d bet money that’s how those bird-like Lesser Hunters are made. Either by tricking humans into consuming the food, or force-feeding them. 

I turned back quickly, not wanting to take the risk of *something* seeing me and oh-so-kindly inviting me to join it for dinner. When I returned to the room with the statue, surprisingly, it was still there and in the exact same position it had been in before. I was waiting for it to follow me. I *know* that thing moved earlier. 

Next, I tried a door located behind the suspicious statue. This room, like the others, was flooded. Shelves as far as the eye could see were overflowing with books. It smelled musty, like some of them had gotten damp. 

How big *was* this place? 

Under my breath, I swore. How the hell was I going to find the right one? In the memory, the ledger had already been opened when the mechanic was signing in, making it so that I wouldn't know what the spine or cover looked like. 

Unsure, I pulled off the nearest book, thumbing through the pages. 

I should've anticipated that they wouldn't be in English. My heart sank as it occurred to me that even if I somehow found the correct ledger, I wouldn't be able to read it.

The hagstone shook. Splashes. Outside the door. I went still, ears pricked. Whatever was moving in the statue room stopped, probably listening for me as well. I didn't move, even slowing my breathing down in an effort to remain as quiet as possible. 

After what felt like hours but in reality couldn't have been longer than five minutes, the thing outside splashed again, going in the direction of the dining hall I'd found earlier. The further away it got, the slower the hagstone’s shakes became. The door creaked open, then slammed shut.

I flipped through the pages of the book in my hands more, even looking at it through the hagstone to see if anything would change. Nothing. Hold on. The book smelled oddly of fresh snow. When I replaced it and selected another, the pages had the scent of dead leaves. 

Did that mean that the one that the mechanic signed smelled like black cherries? 

I started going through each one, trying to find the right scent. Sea spray. Carrion. Lilac. Gooseberries. My nose began to itch from the variety as they all began to blend together. There were still so many more to search. 

A door opened in the statue room again as whatever was out there waded through the water. The hagstone indicated that it was getting closer. Not wanting to find out the hard way what was coming, I ducked behind one of the bookshelves that was tall enough to conceal me. 

The library door opened. My heart pounded as the thing's footsteps caused waves to churn throughout the room. 

A small, quivering voice whimpered, “Someone… help me…”

It stepped further into the room, only the bookcase I hid behind separating us as it sobbed, “Please, is *anyone* there? *Please!*”

Yeah. That was obviously a trap. Don't need to be a pest control specialist to know that. 

It continued down the rows of books, continuing to plead for help that it didn't need. Meanwhile, I tried to stay as still as possible. It eventually grew tired of trying to lure me out; there was one huge splash, then all of a sudden, nothing. The water was still as the waves died. 

*Where did it go?!*

Without moving my head, I glanced around, knowing that it wasn't gone. It was hiding, waiting for me to come out. 

That's when I saw movement above me. It hung to the ceiling, using the hooks on its leathery wings. 

For a while, we just stared at each other, me afraid to move, it waiting to see what I would do. 

Its voice floated down to me, “I know why you're here.”

It didn't sound small and frightened anymore. Its voice was now a deep, menacing hiss. 

Finding my voice, I responded, “Then you know that you can't interfere.”

After a pause, it said, “I do.”

It detached from the ceiling, gliding down to land on top of one of the bookcases in front of me. I raised my shotgun. 

The Hunter tilted his head. Like the statue in the hall, he had antlers protruding from his long dark hair, though this Hunter's horns were entwined with black thorns matching the ones I saw growing in the wall. The thorns wove over where it would have made sense for his eyes to have been. Instead, there was smooth, featureless, pale skin above his nose and oddly full lips. Symbols were carved into his torso, swirling along his muscular shoulders. While the upper half of his body was humanoid, the lower half had hoofed legs covered in shaggy black fur.

The Hunter spoke again, without moving his mouth, “I see why the captain wants you. If he hadn't already claimed you, I'd be tempted to take you for myself.”

I cocked my shotgun. 

The Hunter laughed, lips still closed, “Easy, now!” 

“Leave me to continue my search, if you please.” 

The Hunter snorted, crouching to sit on top of the bookcase, crossing one of his furry legs over the other. “Go right ahead! I won't stop you. I'll just be here, making sure you don't take anything other than what you came for.”

Afraid to turn my back on the Hunter, I side-stepped my way out from where I'd been hiding, keeping my shotgun trained on him. Even though he didn't have eyes from what I could see, I had no doubt that he was watching every move I made. 

Glancing between the Hunter and the nearest shelf, I pulled out another book. When I looked back at the Hunter, I saw that he'd moved closer. Feeling somewhat silly, I sniffed the book, not wanting to shift my hold on the shotgun. Mildew. I put it back. In the brief second that it took for me to do that, the Hunter was now seated on the bookshelf closest to me. He laughed when I flinched back, raising my shotgun at him again. 

“Distracting me counts as interference.” I told him. 

The Hunter flexed his wings before folding them against his back. “Someone's gotta make sure that you're not going to leave with something you shouldn't. We don't take kindly to thieves around here. I'm sure you saw the ones in my thorns out there.”

“I have no intention of taking anything else. Now please, allow me to continue my search.”

The Hunter shrugged, laying on his side, resting his cheek on his hand, “As I said, don't let me stop you.”

He was just going to be a pain in the ass. Between the deal and the hagstone, this Hunter couldn't do anything. I just had to ignore him as best as I could. 

As I examined another book, the Hunter kept going, “So, I gotta ask, do you think that even if you manage to succeed - and that is a *big* ‘if’ - that this'll all be over? That you get to go back to terrorizing our kind without any repercussions?”

“With all due respect, I don't terrorize your kind. I do what I can to keep yours and mine from killing each other.”

“Is that what you think?” He scoffed. “Your ancestors were the ones that forced us out of our own homes, confined us to mounds below the ground. And what did you do with what you took? You destroyed it. And you destroy it more each day. Poisoning the water. Shrinking our forests.”

The Hunter got angrier with each word he spoke until he was practically snarling at me. 

The book I held also wasn't the right one. I put it back, selecting another. *God, where is it*?

The Hunter slid off of the bookcase, splashing me with water, then continued his tirade, “You don't deserve the world you stole. I'll tell you again, Orion. We don't take kindly to thieves here. And we know that it's just human nature to *take.*”

I resisted the urge to pull away from him or to defend myself. It wouldn't matter to him that the events he spoke about happened long before I was ever born. Before Ireland was even a country. *Just keep looking. He can't do anything.* The next book smelled of brimstone and the one beside it reeked of harsh chemicals.

“Nothing to say, Orion?” He growled. 

With the state he was in, saying anything, no matter what it was, would probably piss him off more. I kept going. Cherry blossoms. Ugh. *Come on!* 

The Hunter's voice suddenly got low, “Ignore me if you want. It won't make a difference. Whether it’s in my thorns or in the captain's willows, you belong to the Hunt.”

*Keep it up and I’ll find your name next.* 

But I didn't say that, thinking that silence was still best. I fruitlessly went through more books as the Hunter continued to try to be a thorn in my side (pun intended. I'll see myself out, now.)

“You know after we take you, the witch doctor is next. The captain has no interest in her, so that'll fall to me. I won't have to do nearly as much for her as he has for you. Hell, I won't even need to know her name. All it’ll take is one kiss.”

His lips parted then. A horrible forked tongue lashed out, reaching down to his chest in a wide arc. 

Even though the thought of what he wanted to do to Reyna filled me with a mixture of rage and disgust, I calmly turned to glare at him, breaking my silence to say, “Are you done?”

His entire body stiffened. I don't think he cared for that comment. 

“Would you be so bold if you didn't have the captain's claim to protect you?” He challenged. 

“I'll take that as a ‘no.’” I muttered. 

I withdrew a particularly hefty book. Wait. Black cherries. I quickly flipped through it, even though I couldn't understand what it said. Yes, that was definitely the scent of black cherries. I breathed out a sigh of relief, clutching it to my chest with one arm, the other one still holding the shotgun. 

Softly, from the statue room, a banjo's strings were plucked. 

*Fuck me.*

The other Hunter had vanished. A soft melody was playing, similar to the one that the mechanic had used to force me to fall asleep. The hagstone was going crazy, quivering as it protected me from his spell. 

I quickly explored the library, looking for another door. 

A woman's deep voice whispered from behind one of the stacks, “It won't do you any good. There's only one way in or out.” 

Not trusting the word of a Hunter, I tried anyway. The first door led me to more books. The second stored cadavers, the smell of rotting flesh making me gag. 

The whole time, the mechanic kept his tune going. 

The woman's voice crooned, “If you give your soul to me willingly, I'll be kinder. Kinder than anyone else.”

I didn't respond, propping my gun up on top of the thick ledger as best as I could, then marched to the door. 

The mechanic had dropped his disguise. 

Normally, he appears as a lean, pretty young man whose hair can't decide if it wants to be blond or brown. The being holding the banjo was covered in iridescent chitin that reminded me of armor, clawed fingers grazing the strings. Two pairs of wings spread from his back, like that of a dragonfly. Similar to the thorned Hunter, he didn't have eyes. Spikes rose from his head to form an organic crown. His lipless mouth revealed sharp teeth bared in a permanent, grotesque grin. 

The mechanic’s head lifted to face me. “Howdy!”

I kept the gun trained on him as I sidled towards the door. He kept playing as the hagstone rattled against my collarbone. 

“Looks like you found somethin’! I trust our librarian made ya feel welcome?”

He plucked the strings then. One of the candles suddenly flew towards me. I ducked, shielding the ledger against my chest.  

The mechanic continued, “You know, it's funny. I went to go get your records today, but the nice man behind the desk said he couldn't find you. How ‘bout that? Nothin’ for a woman formerly known as Fiona Cassidy. Either you're a ghost or you pulled some bullshit.”

He swiped the strings again, a wave of water throwing me against the wall. Both the ledger and the gun slipped from my hands as I hit it roughly, the wind being knocked from my lungs. 

He'd found a loophole with the hagstone: as long as he didn't try to directly enchant me, and just acted upon objects, it couldn't do anything to shield me. 

I dove for the ledger just as he plucked the strings again, directing the water to pull it towards him. Keeping one hand on it, I felt for the shotgun. A wave hit me in the face, sour, rancid water invading my mouth and nose. I sputtered, gasping for air, turning my head as another aquatic assault slammed into me, knocking me on my ass. 

Through some miracle, I managed to keep a hold of the ledger. I scrambled in the water to move, my fingers brushing the shotgun's comb. The water launched me into the wall again, but this time, I was ready for it, gripping onto both objects for dear life. 

Once the wave had dropped me to the ground, I took aim at the mechanic only to find that he'd disappeared. Movement out of the corner of my right eye. I fired towards it. 

Suddenly, the mechanic was at my left side, waving his fingers at me tauntingly before disappearing again, the sound of wings echoing through the hall. 

He was too fast. I wouldn't be able to shoot him. I tucked the ledger under my arm, sliding the gun onto my back, then withdrew the iron poker from my belt. When I found that the mechanic was hovering by the statue, I pointed it at him. 

“I do have to say I regret one thing, you know what that is, pup?” He started as he nonchalantly toyed with his strings. 

“No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me anyway.” I grumbled. 

To my surprise, he laughed, the dim gray light glinting off of those huge teeth. 

“Well, look at you acting all tough! Now, as I was sayin’, I regret comparing you to your ol’ man. Souls like his are fast food, you know? Quick and easy to get, but ultimately, not all that satisfying.”

He disappeared in the blink of an eye once again. Holding the fire poker out, I glanced around as I crept towards the exit.

I heard the strings first, then was battered by another wave. I managed to stay upright, even as my knees wobbled. Without looking, I whirled around, poker at the ready, and managed to catch the mechanic on the shoulder. 

He staggered, appearing shocked that I'd managed to get a hit on him. Without giving him any time to react, I swung again, the hit forcing his head to turn as I battered the side of his head. 

While he was stunned, I raced for the exit. 

The water began to flow against me, but I managed to keep going, even as the current threatened to yank me off my feet. It grew stronger. Using the poker, I stabbed into the ground, using it as a walking stick to keep myself upright. The moonlit forest was right in front of me. Just a bit further. 

The water churned violently around me, causing me to slip. With a gasp, I clung to the poker, using all that I had left to keep myself from being pulled back into the church. After a terrifying minute of struggling and slipping, my feet finally found traction.

By alternating between digging the poker into the ground and dragging myself along, I finally made it out to the forest with the ledger still under my arm.

The current abruptly stopped, causing me to stumble a bit. My back and shoulders ached, already bruising from the beating I’d endured. I could tell already it was going to be one of those injuries that hurts more the next day. Fighting the water had taken most of the energy I had left, but I knew that it wasn't over yet. I had to keep going. 

Splashing behind me. I glanced back to see that the mechanic had followed me, appearing human once he crossed the church’s threshold, banjo still in hand. He sported a nasty, dark bruise along the entirety of his cheek; the skin surrounding it looked irritated as well, swollen and reddened. 

He was *beyond* pissed. 

Seeing his expression, I did my best to hurry. He was dangerous enough when he was in a good mood. I didn’t want to know how much worse he could be.

I'd expected him to simply appear in front of me the way he had in the church, but instead he just followed me. Taking his time. Meanwhile, I was pushing myself to the limits trying to get my tired body to move faster than a walk. 

“I'll admit, I didn't expect you to get this far.” He called after me, his words clipped with rage. “You're becoming a real pain in the ass, pup.”

*You wanted things to be exciting, didn't you?* 

I trudged to shore, waiting for another wave to swipe at me, but it never came. When I glanced over my shoulder, he'd disappeared.

My heart pounded as I tried to figure out where he’d gone. There was *no way* he'd just give up. He'd been ready to kill. 

I quickly stumbled in the direction of my car. Once I had almost reached it, I heard the sound of the banjo’s strings, followed by a deafening crunch. My G6 groaned, the back end tilting forward to slam into the ground. 

He'd cut my car in *half.* 

Instinct told me to hit the ground. I did just as a piece of metal whizzed past where my head had just been. Running purely on adrenaline, I scrambled deeper into the woods, just trying to get some distance on him. But how do you outrun something that can move in the blink of an eye?

Some of our resources about the Wild Hunt state that Hunters have been known to chase their victims until their bodies give out from exhaustion. I think that's what the mechanic's goal was that night. He damn near succeeded. I had already been wiped out from the fight in the church. Having to keep running while my lungs burned and muscles tremored was pure torture. 

I kept going, even as my anatomy screamed at me to stop. And each time I slowed, he was right there, spurring me on again. 

Eventually, I collapsed by the river, dropping all that I carried as I caught myself. I coughed roughly, my entire body shaking.  

But then a voice urgently called, “Huntsman! I need her!”

The Weeper. She stood in the water, her pale hair and eyes practically glowing in the moonlight as she stared the mechanic down. 

He stepped out from somewhere behind me. I didn't have to see his face to know he was annoyed at the interruption. 

“For what?” He snapped. 

“She owes me.” I think I heard her voice falter a bit, but then she went right back to sounding powerful. “She must enjoy my song before she dies.”

As I gasped for breath, my arms trembling as they kept me from falling face first into the ground, I watched the Weeper in disbelief. 

*She’s helping me?*

The mechanic was not having it. “She's here, now. Sing your song and get it done with.”

The Weeper quickly replied, “The stipulation was that she had to *enjoy* the performance. How much enjoyment can she derive with you here? And after you've chased her within an inch of her life, no less?” 

The mechanic's head tilted towards the sky, releasing a deep breath of frustration. 

The Weeper spoke again, her voice grave, “You know what it means to interfere with another’s oath. Even you aren’t above such rules, Huntsman.”

Considering, he slowly lowered his chin to level his glare at the Weeper. 

He growled, “I won't wait forever.”

“I only ask for a week. She will have recovered enough to fulfill her promise to me by then. After that, she's all yours.” 

The mechanic's scathing gaze met mine as I remained weakly on the ground, willing myself not to crash. 

He glanced back at the Weeper, “Two days.”

They negotiated, the Weeper trying to buy me more time while he impatiently refused it. It took the last bit of strength within me to keep from pitching forward and expiring right there in the dirt.  

After a bit of back-and-forth, the Weeper eventually got him to settle for four days.
He gave me one last vicious look before he disappeared into the trees. 

The moment we were alone, the Weeper sprinted out of her river, her cold, damp hands delicately clutching my flushed cheeks. Her touch felt nice. An assurance that I wasn't about to drop dead.

She did a double take when she saw the ledger lying on the ground next to me, her eyes growing huge as she whispered, “Where did you get that?” 

“He started… hunting me… before that… had no choice…” I managed to get out between breaths. 

I don't remember what happened after that. Most likely, I'd blacked out, the lack of sleep and overexertion all catching up to me at once. The automatic SOS text had been sent to my coworkers while I was unconscious. Reyna later informed me that when she and Victor had found me, the Weeper had my head resting in her lap.

I came to in Victor's bed, feeling like hellfire was flowing through my limbs. When I went to shower off the grime from the lake, I discovered that my entire back was purple with bruises. Along with that, my chest ached and I had a terrible cough. 

Guess who got pneumonia from breathing in the stupid church water? Granted, it's a mild case, but it's just the cherry on top of the cake. After all this, I think I earned the right to gripe a bit. The Z-Pak is helping, though. 

Victor asked me if I had anything to do with the bruise on the mechanic's face. When I told him about my showdown with the mechanic, he gave me a small smile, saying, “God, I wish I could have seen that!”

I hope he gets a chance to smack the mechanic, too, someday. 

Currently, the ledger is hidden with all of our other important things (Reyna's apartment) until we can find someone who is willing and able to translate it. Initially, I'd been worried that it had gotten damaged during the whole water war, but, thankfully, it was unscathed. My guess is that it's protected by magic. 

I think I might have an idea of who to ask to translate the book. I'll be seeing her in a few days to hear her sing. Wish me luck.
