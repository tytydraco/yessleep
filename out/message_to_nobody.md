8 hours in and I’ve gained enough understanding to remain sane. I understand how to
tread, where to place my feet, and to keep my eyes shut so tight that not even the backs of my
eyelids can light up the feathery veins from the shining of the atmosphere.

 Initially I was
delighted to discover it was breathable with gravity and oxygen shockingly similar to that of
Earth. I couldn’t understand why it was barren if it seemed so livable. I understand now. Nearly
understand. After walking on this supposedly abandoned planet for 483 minutes, I understand
just barely enough to know that nobody should ever venture here again.

 However, each step
away from my ship in my blind trek means that it becomes less likely I’ll make it back and
others will never learn what I have, and more will come.

So I walk, keeping up an imaginary rhythm so asymmetrical that I sweat just trying to
maintain it. Right foot lifted
 PAUSE hover hover inch forward
 PAUSE step down slide left footraiise and raise and raise until 
PAUSE no hover just drop but don’t stomp NOW hover. Doing itlike this does something, though I’m still not entirely sure what. I’m not sure if the pace makes itdifficult for them to follow me, or if the sporadic sounds and silences drown out the sensation of

being crowded, a million times surrounded. Either way it is working, the only footsteps I hear are
my own and that means I am safe.

Of course, while managing this miraculous walk, I need to be aware of the surface I am
stumbling upon. Firm and rugged and bumpy and painful and real, I like that. That raw hurt is
good, it is safe. I’m barefoot and I know the grey clay I stared at before learning to keep my eyes
shut tight is like uncut diamonds, in firmness though not quite in shine. This means my feet are bleeding. I wonder if this is why they follow me. I like to think it is, because then at least the

bleeding can stop, either by scabbing, healing- or by me just…running out.

If the ground smooths out, or worse, my feet fall through liquid, I backpedal with more
speed than my exhausted muscles could seemingly manage and search my aching feet around
back to the safety of the jagged terrain. I’m better about avoiding it now, feeling it on toe tip and
smelling it in the air.

The liquid is when I first saw them. 

It’s fluid- but not quite, like starch and vapor and
milk and mercury. 

It dragged me down with its temperature so nonexistent it burned both hot and
cold in the most excruciating way, it weighed like everything yet I moved freely enough to
escape.

 It tasted like pumpkin and smelled like a maternity ward.

But escaping it was worse I guess, because as I pulled myself out of the prismatic fluid,

my hand gripped a hand and my eyes met eyes.

 And around those eyes I saw a million others
exactly the same and the identical hands all reached out in synchronicity towards mine and my
heart sank to my knees because those nails were chewed to the nub from anxiety and those eyes
were lined pink with exhaustion with preorbital veins fractured to stars.

And I knew those hands
and I knew those eyes 
because they were MINE.

So I shut them tight, hands to fists and eyes to crumpled paper and I ran. I learned
running doesn’t help when a million identical footsteps thunder just behind and around all
around- and my bones vibrate until I think they’ll disintegrate. In 8 hours I’ve learned how to
step. Just step. Blindly reaching for something, any comfort, away from everything.
