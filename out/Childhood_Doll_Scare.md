So I was around 6-8 years old when I had an experience in my house that really terrified me. 

I was laying on my bed and couldn’t seem to go to sleep, so I decided to grab my doll that I’ve had for a good while and stare at its details. I don’t know how to describe it exactly, but it was a female baby doll that was wearing some odd-looking sleepwear with a bib and antennae protruding from its head. 

And this is where it gets unsettling. As I held it, something felt off, like the room’s energy shifted, but I didn’t really think much of it. Then, as I stare at its face, it lets out an eerie, echoed, babylike laughter out of nowhere. I basically continued to stare at it while paralyzed from fear; I felt like some sort of spell was casted on me. To be clear, I was fully awake and know that it was not a dream, since I always somehow know when something actually happened or didn’t. So when I know something strange was real, I’ll occasionally think about it. It was also pretty early into the night from what I remember. Anyways, I can’t remember exactly what happened after, but I basically dropped it and couldn’t sleep for a good while.

After the experience, I never felt as connected and secure with the doll anymore. I actually recently got rid of it while clearing out the basement. Oddly enough, strange things still keep happening around the house, but, to be clear, I recollect that I’ve had experienced these kinds of things even before I got the doll, though sometimes I think that they truly are related in some way or another. 

I still live in the same house and I really started noticing inexplicable things happening around it a few years ago, such as bangs/knocks on the windows, shadow movements, strange noises, and so on. Now I’m more attentive than before on these kind of things so I’m occasionally on the lookout for any unusual activity. In other words, I don’t exactly feel at ease with my own home that I’ve lived in for years anymore.

Even though this was many years ago, I still think about what happened that night and wonder what was truly going on. I most definitely know it was not a dream nor my imagination. This is what first made me believe in the paranormal. I’ve had my suspicions of whether or not these kinds of things were real, but that surely made up my mind. When I’ve heard or read stories of similar nature, I was always skeptical and always wondered how it could be true. But now I’m more empathetic with those who’ve shared similar experiences and understand how they feel, no matter how absurd or made-up it may sound. I used to be a very logical person, but now I realize that not everything can be explained. Some things just have to and will remain unknown.
