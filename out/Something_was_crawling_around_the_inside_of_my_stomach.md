It started about a week and a half ago. I was at work chatting with a coworker, Tom, when suddenly I felt a flash of heat strike me. Bullets of sweat shot down my face. My breathing hastened and I felt faint.

“You okay, Ross,” Tom asked.

I nodded my head "yes," but every other part of me was screaming "no." My knees went weak and I fell to the ground. Hot liquid rushed up my throat and filled my mouth. There was no chance of me making it to the bathroom in time. Luckily Tom had been standing right there, quickly placing a trash can right in front of me.

Chunky creme colored throw up started gushing out of me like a geyser. Tom placed his hand on my back and rubbed it back and forth. Like he was comforting a sick child. I could hear my other concerned coworkers passing by in the background. 

“Is Ross okay,” A female voice said.

“Does he need help,” another one added. Someone went to grab the higher ups for help. 

The flow of vomit didn’t stop for about 10 minutes. Once it finally did I held my stomach and laid flat on my back. The worst pain I ever felt appeared right then and there. As if someone was stabbing my abdomen repeatedly and pouring salt on the wounds.

My managers found me to be in no condition to work, or do anything else for that matter. They let me leave early for the day. Throwing up left me too lightheaded to drive though, so I called a friend to pick me up. 

On the way to my house we had to pull over multiple times because I had to puke again. My friend insisted on taking me to the hospital, but I assured him I’d be fine at home.

When I made it inside my house I immediately grabbed a small trash can, sat it in front of my nightstand, and past out onto my bed. For the next several hours I periodically switched between sleeping and vomiting. Agonizing abdominal pain made it nearly impossible to get comfortable. No matter how low I set the A/C I continued sweating. The whole night I tossed and turned. Sometimes I missed the trash can, so a puddle throw up dripped from the edge of my mattress onto the ground.

I awoke in the morning more tired than the night before. My body had gotten no rest whatsoever. I somehow managed to muster up the energy to crawl to my bathroom. Hunching over my toilet I began hurling again. At this point it was little more than stomach acid and bile. Making my throat burn like never before. I slammed back hard onto the bathroom wall. There was no energy left in me. I contemplated contacting 911. An unplanned visit to the hospital wasn’t in my budget though. Plus, I didn’t want to go and have them tell me it was just a bad case of the flu. I simply hoped whatever this was would pass soon.

For the rest of that day I sat near my toilet, leaving the bathroom only to drink water. My phone went off a couple times. I was tempted to let it go to voicemail. But I picked it up to answer. The first call was from my boss asking if I’d be in today. I knew there was no chance I’d be in that day, and it’d be a miracle if I could come in the next. I told them I was going to be out sick and try to make it in tomorrow. The second call was from my friend checking up on me. I lied to him and said I was feeling better. He was the type to worry so I didn’t want to stress him.

For a while I thought maybe I was getting better. The amount I was vomiting had gone down. My skin finally let the cool air touch it. Although a weird sensation had appeared deep within my stomach. Like something was crawling around inside of me. I chalked it up to cramps and delirium from dehydration.

I went back to my bed and was knocked out for a while. Then a sharp radiating pain jolted me up at midnight. It was like someone was tearing out my intestines. Twisting and pulling them as if they were blocking something.  I felt chunks making their way up my throat again so I made my way to the bathroom as fast as my legs could carry me. This time it didn't feel like liquid though. Bending over the toilet I dry heaved for about twenty seconds waiting for the explosion of burning bile to appear. Nothing came out. 

Instead, an object that seemed to be a thin string was tickling the inside on my throat but wouldn’t leave. It slowly moved high enough to where it was now sitting at the back of my tongue. I reached my fingers in and pulled it out. An instant wave of terror washed over me. Pinched between my index finger and my thumb, a long red fleshy string left my mouth. With no ending in sight. Slowly I felt the string yank up my neck from all the way down in my gut. It was straight out of a horror movie.

Panicking I stumbled to my bedroom and grabbed my phone. I had no idea what was going on, but it certainly was not the flu. My hands shook as I tried to find my friend’s contact. A shock of pain worse than the last three days combined hit me, causing me to drop my phone. Tears trickled down my face from the intensity.  The weird sensation from the day prior had returned. This time less subtle and more violent. Claws shredding through my intestines. My stomach began stretching up and down. It seemed like the surface was being kicked and pushed from the inside. Like something was in there, and desperately wanted to get out.

By this point I was going in and out of it. Fear engulfed my mind but my body refused to move. The pain was too much and my energy was too low. I sat for minutes before passing out. Hours later I awoke on the cold hard ground. Throbbing pain persisted throughout my entire body. A long deep groaning sound left my mouth before I could even register what was going on.

Once I was fully conscious, I instantly noticed my jaw was agape and out of place. I was unable to close it. And there was a trail of blood leading from in front of me to out of my bedroom door. Urgency returned to me and I snatched my phone up, dialing 911 as quickly as possible. Adrenaline being the only thing preventing me from fainting. Words couldn’t be formed with my jaw broken, but I think my gurgled screams were enough to get my message across to the operator on the other side.

Police showed up and found me laying on the hardwood floor of my living room covered in blood and vomit. Without much questioning at all they called for paramedics. I was taken to the ER where doctors ran a plethora of test and scans. They attempted to ask me what happened but I couldn’t answer anything. I knew little more of what had just went down than them.

Test confirmed my insides were torn and I had internal bleeding. No one knew how. The doctors looked to me for answers but I was just as confused. They tried to give every possible explanation under the sun, asking if I had purposefully ingested any sharp object, or recently ate foods with bones, or gotten into a fight. None of the answers covered all my symptoms. I couldn’t even try to elaborate on events due to my jaw injury. 

It’s now been a few days. I’m still in the hospital recovering. Replaying the last few days in my mind trying to piece together what could have possibly caused this.  After reflecting I think even when my jaw heals I won't tell doctors the full story. Not about the red flesh string, or the pushing and kicking sensations I felt. Not even that at some point I could have sworn I saw the outline of something resembling a small face press against the skin on top of my stomach. I’d sound insane if I did. My best option is to get treatment and move forward like this whole thing never happened. Acting as if it really was just a serve case of the flu.
