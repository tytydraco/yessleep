I'm posting this story here begging you guys believe me, I've seen you all go through some crazy stuff and I desperately need your help.

If it helps any I'm in Louisiana.

For some context, me (19M)and my 4 friends, Perry (19M), Gwen (21F), Jordan (18M) and Jesse (20F) had a small YouTube channel, only about 200 subscribers and on average 10-30 views per video. We called ourselves "cryptid hunters" we'd just record bushes with shakey hands, screaming at every noise in the woods. 

We usually had a few set spots, swamps, forests, usually that we'd explore and look at, we cleared them out, seen it all. So we decided we'd go to a new swamp further away from our homes with this rusty van Jordan bought with some money from his side jobs. We went to the place, checked it out. Usually with new places we don't really do this but we chose to split up.

It's a pretty big area so Jesse and Perry suggested we should split up, cover more ground. Stupid idea, even to me. And if I was in a horror movie I'd probably be the one to call out "anyone there?"

So, Jesse and Perry went together, then me, Jordan, and Gwen were together.

I was holding a camera while Jordan and Gwen had a GoPro strapped to their heads. We were in that place for hours. It was hot, and uncomfortable. We barely got any footage and were on the verge of just waiting in the van.

Until my stupid self chose to do a stupid bit to make the hypothetical video entertaining.

I laughed to myself thinking about it and told Jordan my idea. He'd do a dumb dance or something, and then I'd record him, saying "a white guy in his natural habitat." A dumb joke, for a dumb video for an even dumber channel. 

Gwen and I sat in a bush, so it'd seem more "realistic." She kept whispering how she was getting bad vibes.

Unfortunately, I didn't listen. I didn't care when I heard the first few twigs snap, I didn't care when Gwen was tugging on my sleeve. I didn't care until we saw something pounce from the trees, and make me see what a stomach looks like. 

I almost screamed, my heart was pounding in my ears and I think Gwen fainted. I don't want to go into detail because even thinking about it makes me sick to my stomach.

The smell of death was pungent and after that thing dragged him away me and Gwen could do nothing but run until we saw the van. Perry and Jesse were already there and when they asked where Jordan was I just screamed at him to fucking drive already. 

I've tried showing people the footage. No one believes me that it wasn't a bear, or a wolf. But I saw it. It wasn't a wolf. It wasn't a bear. It was too human. 


I PRAY to a god if there is one that someone will please tell me what the hell ate my friend. I need closure. At least a tiny bit.

EDIT: Some of you have been asking for more details, sorry for not giving more originally.

We're located in Acadiana, I don't remember the name or location of the swamp really, you have to understand there are like a thousand here. 

The type of van was a Chevrolet Express 3500

I've been looking over I and Gwens footage more, and it looked a lot like what your comments suggested. A rougarou.

Thank you for everyone's help. I'm really grateful. I'll try asking some locals for any more information on it.
