Jacob awoke drenched in sweat panting he got to his feet and walked into the shower washing and cleaning himself off of the long night. after his shower he drys off walking into the living room

 checking his voice box “you have 1 new message”  Jacob sighs “here we go again”  he presses play “hey umm I I don’t know if if this is the right number b but ummmm I I think someone’s after me this this town there’s more to it I’m im writing a book and and just just please get here I’ll pay what I have now but but when this is published I’ll give you a good chunk of the money shit someone’s coming the address is ____ oragon

The women on the over end voice smooth like honey and oddly familiar and oddly nostalgic “mmmmm my home town haven’t been there since since” jacobs breath went uneasy he breathed fast and heavy

 trying to get air he stumbled into a chair reaching into his coat pulling a pill bottle taking a few swallowing them after some time on the floor and trying to learn how to breath normal again he stood up Jacob 5’6   170 to 185 pounds  green eyes  dark brown hair  his chin and upper lip shows sighs of beard growing in “I I fucking hate this shit what’s wrong with me” he throws his coat on a brown leather trench coat his grand-dad gave him he hopped into his car a black 1988 Chrysler Fifth Avenue

 his fathers old car and started his 7 hour drive to organ all while memorys of the past flash in his mind hitting him like a metal bat glimps of old friends and what happened November 27th. Jacob turned the radio on distracting himself with the music driving to a place he thought he’d never go to but there’s something about this case unlike a missing lover run away kid or disappearance this felt different either the familiarity of the women on the other end of the phone or a hunch. he made his way home to a place he left in the deepest parts of his mind longing for the day he’ll forget all about it all of what happened all of the events on November 27th 2007  but only time will tell right?


After a long drive jacob makes it to his old home town renting a room in a motel collapsing onto the bed falling into a deep slumber. almost instantly as he sleeps he appears on a road cop cars and ambulances a group of people standing near the side of the road looking down the hill some throwing up others crying jacob moves toward it  almost like he’s floating to it. 


jacob sees what they see he remembers November 27th he screams as he flashes else where “hay hay you ok” a young girl around 12 maybe 16 was there he wasn’t at the motel he was at a house he looked at his hands there small like a child’s  like it’s  another memory maybe “what happened where am i” jacobs voice filled with confusion and panic “damn must have been a really really bad nightmare” the girl had brown hair going to her neck her eyes green as well skin a taneish pale

 “wh what’s what’s”
 
 “this is all real this blanket fort the floor and me you’re best friend kimber” 


as soon as she says her name flashes of what he saw that cold day as Well as other events before that November day. jacob shoots awake drenched in sweat he runs into the bathroom throwing up last nights fast food stop he dry heaves a few times before flushing and washing his mouth out he gets into the shower questioning what just happened out of all the night terrors he’s had this one was the most strange. after the shower he gets dressed and heads out he did a check on the caller id it seems to have been made from a phone booth he looked around seeing a camera on one of the builds


 he walks in “hay I’m a detective yesterday early around this time there was a young women at the phone booth” Jacob looked at the young teen across the counter he barely looks like he’s there he seems like he’d rather get hit by 5 trucks set on fire and box a champion boxer then be here


 “I don’t know wasn’t here that day”  

“then can I have a look at the cameras to see please”  

“can’t let ya sorry”

 Jacob sighs getting frustrated with the unhelpful teen “look kid you look like you’d rather be hit by a bus then be here so..” Jacob pulls out two hundreds dollars “you show me the tapes and I’ll make it worth your time” the boy looks at the Cash and smiles “right this way then” the boy leads him to the cam room showing him the footage a  girl walks up to the booth makes a call looking around frantically and paranoid then all of a sudden she’s gone disappears out of no where 

 the boy rewinds it and plays again but no she flat out disappers “maybe there’s a cut in the tape or something but that’s strange really strange” the boy smiles shaking abit “that that’s some freaking shit”  Jacob looked confused as well “go back frame by frame”  the teen dose so on the frame before the girl disappears is static with a message “PLEASE STOP” the teen was laughing leaning back

  “hay is this like a horror prank or something am I gonna be on TV”  “I wish this was a TV show kid I really did” Jacob throws him the money leaving getting in his car  “hmmmmm the library that probably can give me info remind me of this town”  he made his way to the old library walking inside. the entrance room before entering fully was a board full of missing posters they filled the entire board there were even some placed ontop the others ages ranging from 25 to 12 


“what is going on here?…..”  Jacob walked fully into the library as soon as he stepped foot in memories of his early childhood filled his mind he smiled at them as he walks to the computers. sitting down remembering when him and Kimber would come here to study he exhaled shakily “I I miss you kimber……”  he got to work researching the disappearances he saw  “young boy missing….”  “Teen girl falls off the face of the earth”  “25 year old man missing”  all had the same outcomes they disappear without a trance and nothing is found  


“hmmmm what is going on some town conspiracy a giant human trafficking ring surely”  Jacob mutters to himself at the constant dead ends he’s hitting “I’m getting hungry best take a break from this clear my head get food then come back to this” he leaves heading to a nearby dinner sitting in a corner booth “hmmmm I I I think I came here with her as well so many blank spots in my mind why” a young waitress black hair walks up to Jacob “what can I start you with”  “Lemonaid and pancakes with bacon”  “I’ll have it out as quick as I can”  they walk off 


 “hmmm it’s been awhile since I’ve orders that guess it’s the old town bringing back old memories must be an old autopilot response”  he looks though a town newspaper he picked up on the way in when something catches his eye  “Missing person young boy 19 missing”  Jacob reads though it but nothing is mentioned about the girl. he sees an address  “guess i better question the parents”  he sighs as he gets his food eating. while he eats he feels something watching him he looks outside at the treeline “what the hell is going on in this town”  he finishes stacking his plates leaving money and a decent tip driving to the family of the missing kids house. 


after a short drive he knocks on the door after a short minute the door swings open he sees a panicked women eyes puffy and red  “I’m an investigator can I ask you some questions to help find your boy”  “yes come in”  she leads him to the living room  “my names marry so about my boy Jake”  “how long has Jake been missing”  “about 3 weeks”  “was he acting strange before he disappeared or…..”  “he did seem abit off but I thought it was just from school or something personal”  “understandable now was there any sighs of him leaving or if he’s out there him using a credit card or cash missing”  “no not at all its it’s like he just…..”  “disappeared off the face of the earth”  Mary nods “there was this though and it it concerns me”  


Mary placed a photo on the table it’s a photograph of the woods with friends in the background  once you notice it’s hard not to see it a man around 6’3 dressed in a duster coat dress vest shirt  pants boots and top hat all in black with a cane the man’s face is hazy like a werid smog or fuzziness around it   “Well well well that seems to be are first suspect”  “y y you think  there’s there’s something else in in his journal he he kept writing a name and nightmares of a similar figure he he called it the shadow man”  “can I have a copy of this photo ma’m” 


 Mary nods handing him one Jacob thanks the lady leaving the house “w w wait before you go there there’s one more thing he he was hanging out up in the hills with this group or or…….” She looks around then slams the door close locking it  “Something ain’t right in this town”  he drives back to the motel beat from all that’s happened he starts hanging the newspaper piece the photo that Jake took and the last photo of the girl he lays down falling asleep quickly. late in the night he wakes not able to move a shadowy figure like the one in the photo stands in the corner watching him this lasts for what feels like an eternity when he wakes  gasping for air drawing his gun aiming it around but there’s nothing no trace of that thing “what the hell is going on” he places his gun on the nightstand but there’s a piece of paper on the table “Remember are Time capsule” under it are coordinates signed by K “how the hell is this possible”.
