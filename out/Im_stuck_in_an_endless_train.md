If you are reading this I am a 23 y/o F and I just got on a train, almost about 2 hours ago.   The train was set to leave from New York to San Francisco, at 11:45 AM
I don't have long to talk so I'll do my best.   From what it looks like the train keeps driving through mountains, but the mountains keep repeating themseleves.   I wasn't sure at first if they were the same or not, but after watching it twice, I realized they were, even the tunnel is the same.       I don't know whats going on, or if this is some sort of screen trick the train can do.    
There was also one other guy who was sitting with me on the train, and it was only gonna be us two.  As we were talking, we both realized a tunnel was approaching, and that is when everything started, and he also dissapeared.   I have searched around this whole train looking for someone.   Anyone.   There was nothing to no avail, as I write this my phone only has 31% battery left on it, and I'm terrified to let it die.   I have found plug ins on the train but none of them seem to emit an eletrical signal.     I have tried calling friends, family, even the police to no avail either.   It only seems this app is the only thing I can use.
Hold up.   I hear.. Growling?   









Something was definitely walking across the top of the train, after I heard the growling, I made a book for a new cart, and to what I saw, the train looked infinite.   Like I could run a mile and I still wouldn't be able to find a way to stop the train or reverse it.   Regarding the growling and footsteps, that is the first sound I have heard since everyone dissapeared and only heard nothing but the train rock back and forth, and the wheels turning.


Its been about an hour, I'm down to about 25â„… battery, but I was able to remove the wall that protected me from the wires going to the outlet.   Everything seems connected and the wires look correct, so I'll try plugging my phone in.

It works! Oh my gosh!  The phone is charging again!
Wait...   The door to the last cart wasn't open before...
I don't know if I should approach it to shut it, or if I should let it be and wait for more of my battery to charge.


Its been about an hour later and I decided to not shut it, but have mustered up the courage a few times to check if there was anything there.   I didn't see anyone or anything, so I'm assuming I left it open myself, and just didn't realize.    I'm going to grab my bag, phone, and charger and go look for some food, but I am going to leave a peice of tape behind for every door I shut.   


I found a whole room of food, after goinf through a few train carts, and every door I put tape on has remained shut.    I'll leave a peice of tape on the next door ahead just in case.
Now its time to see what they got to eat on this cart, and find a new way to keep my phone charged.

I won't lie, after sitting in here for about 5 mins, I noticed the next train cars door further from me, has opened, and this time I can actually see someone.   They don't seem friendly  but at the same time too they don't seem hostile either, so I'll open my door here and offer some food for them.

..This will be my last message, if anyone else writes on this post, it is no longer me.   Please avoid the train and beware of the girl you might see on it.
To my family who has found this, please remember I love you.
