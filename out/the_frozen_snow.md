  
  
Rain and snow fell in an unrelenting torrent, drenching the desolate town in a shroud of darkness. The wind howled like a mournful symphony, rattling the windows and causing the trees to sway in agony. In the heart of this tempestuous night, you found yourself stranded in front of a run-down cabin.  
  
The feeble light of a single flickering lantern barely illuminated the area around the cabin. Your footsteps echoed on the rain-soaked ground and the snow-covered path leading to the cabin's crooked door. Unease gnawed at you, tendrils of fear wrapping around your heart.  
  
The cabin stood like a decaying relic, its wooden walls weathered by years of neglect. Broken windows stared back at you like empty eyes, and the creaking of the structure seemed to blend with the distant whispers in the shadows. You hesitated before pushing the door open, the rusty hinges groaning as if in protest.  
  
The interior was frozen in time, draped in tattered curtains and dust-covered furniture. A chill seeped into your bones as you stepped cautiously inside, your breath forming misty clouds in the frigid air. The scent of damp wood and old memories hung heavy, as if the cabin itself held the weight of its history.  
  
A single candle cast a dim glow in the corner of the room. You dared to believe you were alone until a whisper, barely audible, brushed against your ear. "One for prey," it murmured, a chilling undertone that sent shivers down your spine. The words were followed by another whisper, "One for sacrifice," its cadence a dissonant melody that resonated within you.  
  
Panic clawed at your throat as you turned to flee, only to find the doorway blocked by a shadowy figure. The cabin's walls seemed to close in around you, suffocating you in the presence of the figure. The whispers grew louder, forming a chilling chorus of despair and anguish. The candle's light flickered and sputtered, casting fleeting glimpses of the figure's twisted, contorted face.  
  
Your heart raced as you stumbled backward, the room spinning in a nauseating whirl. The walls seemed to close in, and the air grew frigid, as if the very essence of the cabin was suffocating you. The figure's voice, a distorted symphony of agony, beckoned you closer, its unnatural resonance vibrating through your bones.  
  
Desperation gripped you. You turned to flee, your steps faltering as the shadows seemed to claw at your heels. The cabin's oppressive atmosphere pressed against you, as if it were alive, a malevolent force determined to keep you within its grasp.  
  
Finally, you burst through the cabin's door, gasping for air as the rain and snow pelted your face. The whispering followed you, lingering in the rain-soaked air like a haunting refrain. You stumbled away from the cabin, each step a desperate bid for escape.  
  
And then you felt itâ€”an unseen presence stalking you through the rain-drenched night. Ashen humanoid monsters with sunken black eyes, long clawed toes, and fingers emerged from the shadows. Their tormented whispers echoed in your ears, driving you to the brink of madness. Among them was a larger creature, covered in black, bloody fur, with a deer skull for a face. Its hollow eye sockets bore into your soul.  
  
They tormented you relentlessly, their presence haunting every step you took. The bigger one with the deer skull seemed to lead them, its eerie visage imprinted on your mind. Your sanity began to fracture, the relentless pursuit pushing you to the edge.  
  
Days turned into a nightmare, your mind slowly unraveling. The monsters' whispers seemed to merge with the wind, a maddening symphony that echoed in your thoughts. Sleep became a distant memory, replaced by a ceaseless torment that wore down your will.  
  
The snow-covered ground became a frozen tableau of your terror as your mental defenses crumbled. The cabin, the monsters, and the tormenting whispers became an inescapable loop of horror. The line between reality and nightmare blurred, and you found yourself lost in a perpetual cycle of despair.  
  
As you kept looking at the face, the walls grew darker, and the voices became louder. But before you even realized it, you were in the arms of the big one, its breath like frozen daggers cutting into your skin. Its deep, scratchy voice whispered into your ear, "One for prey, one for sacrifice, and you for me." Your eyes widened further in terror as the walls darkened, and the figures emerged from the darkness, covering you. Everything went black, and you woke up, thinking it was all a horrible dream.  
  
The clock read 3:00 AM, and the storm had gotten so bad that you couldn't see outside. Your heart raced as you looked at your wrist and saw the marks you had left all those years ago. You lay your head back down, attempting to calm your racing thoughts as you drifted off to sleep.  
  
But as sleep began to claim you, a single sharp tap on your window shattered the fragile calm. Wide-eyed, you turned your head to look, and there, amid the stormy night, were two beady black, pearl-like eyes and an impossibly large, needle-like tooth grin, facing you through the glass.
