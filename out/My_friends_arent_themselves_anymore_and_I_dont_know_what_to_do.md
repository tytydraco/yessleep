Please send help. I've been in this hellhole for 5 hours. Sorry if I sound like a selfish coward throughout... whatever's happened to me, this has just been a lot and I don't know what to do or how to get out of here. I'll try to recap everything as accurately as possible, so that you get the general idea.



I'm gonna share a couple of screenshots from my friends' GC for context.



FYI, my username is "UnintendedPalindrome09", Shawn's is "jeans", Jamie's is "egg.sand.brkfst", Matt's is "sk‚ò†Ô∏è11y".

We met up at Shawn's at about 5 PM.



He's upper-middle class; his dad owns a couple of local mattress stores and his mom is a heart surgeon.

He lives in a mansion, and always wonders why we hang out there, *"instead of Jamie's or Dean's apartment, or wherever Matt lives"*. Shawn's home has three separate bedrooms and bathrooms, a home theater and a room filled with a bunch of clocks. Shawn says it's his dad's clock collection, but when we enter it, the clocks suddenly stop ticking, so I don't know what's up with that.



Anyway, we're all outside and nobody's saying anything.



I tried breaking the ice. "So, where's the warehouse? Isn't that what we came here for?"



"Huh?" Jamie suddenly stopped scrolling and took out her right earbud, putting it in her pocket and blankly staring at me, as if processing the information I just told her.



"Oh, yeah, I dunno. Go ask Shawn."



she replied, going back to scrolling through videos of anime clips played above Subway Surfers gameplay.



"Prolly behind that dumb fuckin' mansion." Matt smirked, pointing up and adjusting his sunglasses.



"That's Shawn's home, you know how he feels about us making fun of his ‚Äúdumb mansion‚Äù." I argued.



*Why do we keep making fun of each other?*



"Why are you such a square, man? Jeez." He looked deeply offended, sliding his vape out from under his sleeve.



"You wouldn't want Shawn to make fun of your apartment, would you?"



"Oh, here we go. *‚ÄúYou wouldn't want Shawn to make fun of your apartment, would you? You wouldn't download a car!‚Äù*" Matt parroted in a nerdy voice, flailing his arms around.



"Live a little, dude," he said, now in a serious tone. "You don't always have to be goody-two-shoes, you're allowed to make fun of your friends a little bit."



"Sorry, I just didn't wanna come off as an-"



"Hey, what's up, guys? I was busy... ironing my shirts. What's going on here?" Shawn strolled in, carrying a heavy box of equipment.



"Oh, we were just talking about where the warehouse is. Or where it could be, because you haven't told us where it is," I answered.



"You should really get yourself together, Shawn. Your shirt's on backwards and it has ketchup stains on it," Jamie said judgmentally, briefly looking away from her phone, before going right back to mindlessly scrolling.



"Oohh, that? I found out there's actually a bunch of protein in ketchup, so I started ordering ketchup packets from McDonald's and eating them. You know, for bulking," he said, putting the box on the ground with a thud, then striking a confident pose.



"You eat ketchup...? Like, as a snack?"



"Yeah, but we don't have to talk about that." 



Shawn slowly took off the lid, revealing 50 tiny flashlights in neat individual plastic packages. "I got us some flashlights, like you asked me to. I stole these from a Walmart dumpster. Don't tell anyone," he grinned, expecting to see our horrified reactions.



Jamie was doomscrolling, phonk music faintly blasting through the earbud in her hoodie pocket. Matt was wiping the condensation off of his sunglasses with his jacket.



"Why... would you do that?" I said, peeking into the container, grabbing and unwrapping a flashlight.



It felt cheap; smooth, light and flimsy. The neon green and orange coloring irritated my eyes. Felt like a cheap toy more than anything.



"Ugh, don't ask. Doesn't matter. Whatever." Shawn said, dismissing the question. He took a handful of cheap flashlights and handed them out.



"Wait, I wasn't paying attention." Jamie put her phone in her pocket, furrowing her eyebrows.



"What the hell is this?!" she said, throwing the flashlight on the ground and lightly stepping on it, shattering it into tiny shards of glass and plastic.



Matt took a hit of his vape, and choked on his own spit while exhaling. "Dude-" **\[cough\]** "Dude, aren't you like, a billionaire?", he snickered in the middle of coughing.



"Shut up! Let's just head to the warehouse already." Shawn shushed him, quickly scanning his surroundings. "We gotta head down this path. You guys got enough battery left?"



"Yeah, I got about 97% left. Should be enough." I muttered.

---

"Why are we sneaking around, anyway?" Matt asked, hiding his vape in the sleeve of his jacket.



"My dad's home. He's in the clock room... adjusting his clocks or something. I don't know what he does in there, but it'll buy us time." Shawn whispered, trying not to draw attention to himself.



"Alright...? Are you not allowed to go near the warehouse or something?"



"Yeah, my mom told me this weird wives tale all the time. It goes something like...



‚ÄúThere's a reason why we built our home in front of that old warehouse. My friend, my dear old friend, went to the warehouse one day. I dared him to go there, and stay for a day. When he returned, he was never the same.‚Äù It's like a song, or a poem. Gets stuck in your head, especially if you hear it every week for like, two years."



"Two years?! Damn, man."



"I'm starting to question whether or not we should do this." I butted in, slowly backing away.



"What are you, a coward?! Come on, we don't have time for this!" Shawn hissed through gritted teeth, grabbing my wrist and digging his fingernails into my skin.



Jamie audibly groaned. "Let's just go already. If Dean wants to be a pussy, he can leave whenever. It's not like we're holding him hostage."



I retorted, putting my hands up. "Fine, fine! I'm sorry, alright? I-I'm just anxious."



I felt like something was wrong. Terribly wrong. I just couldn't quite put my finger on it.

---

The warehouse's front gate looked like it was centuries old, weathered and rusted from decades of rain and terrain. The bottom left corner of it was lousily pried open, the opening just barely big enough to crawl through.



Matt cocked his head to the side, putting a hand on his hips. "This place looks sketchy."



"Looks fun." Shawn said, grinning.



"Looks..." - The words got stuck in my throat. I felt a rush of cold sweat on the back of my neck.



"Looks good, yeah." I finished, taking a deep breath.



"Quit doing that, man. I'm sure it's-..." Matt took another hit from his vape, exhaling the fumes and letting out an excruciatingly long dry cough, then gasping for air.



"...sure it's fine. Choked on my spit," he gestured to his throat, bending down and coughing once again.



I sighed. "Let's just get this over with."



*Breathe in, breathe out... Breathe in, breathe out...*



I got on all fours and carefully crawled through the tight opening, holding my breath.



I exhaled and took a deep breath through my nose, instantly being thrown into a coughing fit. The stench of rotting flesh was unbearable.

The interior of the warehouse was strangely warm; the tiled floor was slimy and slippery, much like a mother's womb. It was bright enough in there to read a book. I felt a rush of hot air blowing in and against my direction. As the wind brushed against me, I almost thought the roof moved up and down about half an inch. 



"So, what's out there?" Matt asked, peeking in.



I stood up, nearly slipping on gunk.



I was inspecting the area, stunned. "You have to see this. I-I can't... I'll sound insane."



After looking around, I touched a wall out of curiosity. It was made out of large gray bricks, covered in oddly soft translucent film.



It almost looked like... skin.



I felt a stinging pain in my index finger, like getting jabbed with a thousand tiny syringes. I let out a quiet *"ow!"* before hearing the sound of metal scraping and creaking behind me.



Matt was trying to pry the gate open with his bare hands. He crawled through the larger opening he made, Jamie following behind him.



Shawn quickly tried to squirm through the hole. The sharp edges of the gate tore off a part of his crumpled shirt and skin on his back and side, leaving a deep, thin wound in its place.



Shawn let out a painful, yet quiet yelp, trying to clutch the oozing cut in a panic, his hands getting covered in his own blood.



He looked pale and sickly, wiping the blood off of his hands against his torn, ketchup-stained shirt. "Shit... Anyone got band-aids?" 



"We didn't bring any. I don't think any of us thought this would happen, frankly." Matt said flatly, fidgeting with his flashlight.



"...Am I gonna get lockjaw?" Shawn asked, looking utterly terrified.



Nearly everything that could go south did in approximately 5 minutes. I was scrambling to find a solution to all this.



"I'll go get help," I suggested. "J-Just make up an excuse, and I'll fetch you some tissues, or a bandage, or-"



"Are you kidding me?! My dad's gonna kill me if he finds out about this!" Shawn said, looking at me like I was insane.

He tore off his sleeve and haphazardly covered his wound up with it, the fabric soaking up his blood in an instant. "Look, I can improvise, it's fine. I'm fine," he said, as blood was dripping down his torso.



Jamie rubbed her temple and wiped her sweaty forehead. "We need to do something; either we explore the warehouse now or we tell Shawn's dad about this and go back home. Hangout cancelled or... delayed, I dunno."



*What am I supposed to do?*  
  
*Can't we just meet up another time?*

*No, they'll get mad at me. They'll stop hanging out with me.*

*Just have to go along with the plan, and everything will be okay.*



I reluctantly agreed to explore the warehouse.

---

The deeper we went in, the more filth and grime was in our surroundings.



Matt turned his flashlight on, the weak, flickering light barely illuminating anything in the already bright building. 



"This place is definitely bigger on the inside than I thought it would be," he said, turning off the flashlight and throwing it behind his back.



Suddenly, Shawn stopped limping and jolted upright, pointing his finger up in the air shakily. "This place is bigger than a football stadium!" he said enthusiastically, a demented grin spreading across his face and quickly dissipating.



"Are you feeling okay?" I said, patting his back.



"This is worse than that-..." **\[cough\]** "...that time the ref gave me a yellow card for itching my nose."



I let go of his shoulders, taking a few steps back. "W-What are you talking about...?"



Shawn let out a series of wet, gurgling coughs. He fell down on his knees, bruising them and bending down, his hands on the wet, slimy tiles.



He began throwing up... something, his body shaking and twitching. The liquid itself looked like viscous clear goo with bits of pink flesh and blood mixed in. It smelled like rotting flesh, coming out of his nose and mouth. 



After a time that felt like hours, he coughed out the last glob of that liquid and stood up perfectly straight.



He turned around to look directly at me.



His eyes were gone.



Only crimson red, unnaturally wide eye sockets remained in their place.



"I love soccer more than anything in the world." he said, that same eerie grin spreading across his face. "Do you like sports like I do?"



*Breathe in... Breathe out... Breathe... BREATHE! No, this isn't working!*



I glanced over to Matt for help. I couldn't think straight or think at all, really.



He was leaning up against the wall, his arms crossed, looking off into the distance. His vape was on the ground next to Shawn, which was covered in whatever was inside him.



I ran up to Matt as fast as I could. He looked like he wasn't fully there. I grabbed him by the shoulders, trying to jolt him awake.



"We have to go, now! Please, I-"



"Huh? What's going on? Sorry, I zoned out," he replied nonchalantly.



**"MATT!"**



He shook his head, burying his face in his hands. "What's happening?! God, my head hurts... what happened to Shawn?"



"I..." I gestured to Shawn, who was now facing us.



Matt lifted his sunglasses up to take a proper look at him - at it. "That's not... that can't be Shawn anymore."



"We have to go!" 



"Go? Go where?" 'Shawn' asked, tilting its head slightly.



Matt cowered in fear. "No, no! That's not... you're not... Get away from me!"



"We won't get anywhere if we hide, Matt! What are you doing?!"



Matt was hyperventilating, curled up into a ball. "No, but... that's not gonna... we're not gonna be able to... able to..."



I heard a loud meaty pop from inside of Matt. Inside of his head.

He stood up, taking off his sunglasses. That substance was leaking out of his eye sockets and ears, getting into his mouth and onto his chin, but he still had that smile. That fucking smile.



"What are you, a coward, dude? Come on, trust me..."



It said in a mocking dude-bro voice, leaning in close to me, its eyeless sockets boring into my soul. I felt its breath on my neck; it smelled like a cadaver left out in the sun for a month. It grabbed my wrist, tearing into it with its fingernails.



"...you'll never have enough time to run."



I pushed it away with all of my strength. 'Matt' just stood there, unmoving.



*They're all gone. Matt, Shawn... wait.*





*Where did Jamie go?*





I looked around the warehouse, trying to regain my composure, trying to find a compromise to this mess.



*Matt, Shawn...*



"Jamie!"



She was lying on her side in that filth, facing away from me. I could see her thumb doing that swiping motion. Swiping down, again and again and again...



"Jamie, come on, we have to-"



She rolled over to face me, sighing.



There was a swarm of pale white worms gnawing on her leg, tearing through her flesh like butter.



"What is it?", she asked, not taking her eyes off of her phone.



"What the fuck are you doing?! I can't just let you die here!"



Jamie casually shrugged. "Whatever. Not like that matters."



*They're all gone, stop wasting your time! Just run!*



I ran off, not looking back.



*Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out...*



I heard a faint "good luck," before leaving everything behind.

---

*Thank God, I'm safe. I can get out of this shithole, live a long, happy life...*



*No, I wouldn't. I'm a coward. Leaving my friends to rot.*



*They're not my friends anymore! Those things are just pretending!*





*It doesn't matter. I just need to get to the exit. Wait, where's the gate...?*



*Where's the gate?*



*Where's the* ***GATE?!***





The roof moved up...



...and down, about 3 inches. Another gust of wind. Colder, this time. I felt myself getting weaker and weaker and...

---

I woke up to a shrill, high-pitched chorus of laughter. 



"Going somewhere, Dean?" 'Shawn' asked, laughing in my face. 



I rubbed my eyes, my hands covered in slime. "What...?"



I was right back where I started.



I'm typing this out now, I don't know what else to do. I've tried calling 911, my parents, any contacts in my phone - all I heard was that same fucking laughter on the other end of the line.



Shawn - or whatever's left of him - is talking to me now.



It's laughing at me. Laughing in my fucking face.

 

"Tick, tock, tick, tock... The clock is ticking, Dean. You won't have long before we're all **gone.**"
