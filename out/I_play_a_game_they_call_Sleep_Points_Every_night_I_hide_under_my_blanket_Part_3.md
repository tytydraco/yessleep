Part 3:

Needless to say, I was tired as hell the next day from having gotten no sleep. I did the same routine as the morning before, waiting for mom to take her shower and then checking my phone. Finally, it had reached 100%. But given how quickly it was draining battery these days, I decided it was probably best to just keep it on the charger. The last thing I wanted was to finally get my phone back, just to find out it had died, and then have to wait however many forevers it would take to regain enough battery to actually be usable again. I checked the app. Since yesterday the number went from 0 to 10, today I was expecting it to have gone from 10 to 20. Sure enough, I was right. Right in the middle of the screen was a big fat “20” and nothing else.

Since I was finally beginning to come to terms with what all was going on, the next few days were relatively uneventful. At least compared to the days that came before.  I knew I would have to live with whatever was trying to kill me in my clock. Or else I’d die from it. Probably. I didn’t actually know what would happen. But I was still pretty sure I didn’t wanna find out. But I guess I didn’t know that. After all, maybe the demon was friendly. But they aren’t usually. And the face it was making at me from within the clock didn’t exactly scream “friendly”. So, naturally, I wasn’t really liking my odds and knew it would be common sense to play it safe.

I got into a bit of a routine. Due to what had happened on the second night of dealing with the clock nonsense where I had almost gotten myself killed from having fallen asleep too early, I made a point to stay up until midnight every night to make sure I would be awake when the monster finally came, just to be sure I was putting my whole body under my blanket, including my head, and not moving even the slightest bit. If I was doing the same thing, I would get the same results. 

Although, on Thursday, the fourth night, I began to wonder if maybe I should just go to sleep early and risk it. After all, the glaring light from the clock as it approached midnight woke me up once. Maybe it’d do it again if I went to sleep in the same position again, facing the clock. But I just couldn’t bring myself to risk it. I also considered just going to sleep with my blanket over my head, along with the rest of my body. That way, when midnight came I’d still be completely covered by the blanket and I’d block out the glaring light of the clock while I was at it. But at the time I didn’t like that idea either since I remembered being told when I was a kid that going to sleep with my blanket over my head would suffocate me. I guess not enough air was gonna get to my head through the blanket. I now know that that is complete crap, however. Well, mostly crap. It does still technically limit your air, to a certain extent.  It’s complicated.

But anyway, at the time I just didn’t wanna risk it. After all, even if I could go to sleep with the blanket over my head (which, again, you absolutely can) what if I moved in my sleep at the exact wrong time, right at midnight? What if that let the monster know I was there? What if that provoked him into attacking me somehow?

And so, I performed that exact ritual, night after night, for the next couple of nights. Something about doing the same thing every night gave me a sense of calm and control over the situation. It made me feel like I knew what I was doing. Like I could come out of this alive. Or at least for the foreseeable future. And every morning, I’d also check the number on the app. It always went up by 10. I always knew what number I was going to see. But just seeing a number go up, as stupid as it sounds, was entertaining and gratifying enough in its own right, for whatever reason.

While I was down in my parent’s room sneaking some phone time, I also got into the habit of checking the live sub count between Pewdiepie and T-Series over on FlareTV. This was back in early 2019, when T-Series hadn't quite passed Pewdiepie yet.  Obviously now we know how that all turned out. And at the time we all realistically knew how it was going to turn out anyway. Even if we didn't wanna admit it.  But just watching those numbers go up and compete with one another all on its own was mesmerizing to me. Watching one of my favorite YouTubers beat out a whole-ass international corporate entity was truly epic beyond measure. 

As I watched the subscriber count though, sometimes I thought to myself what would happen first: T-Series catching up with Pewdiepie or the thing in the clock catching up with me. Though I of course hoped that both of those things were far into the future. Even though I had a sneaking suspicion that neither one really was. 

But since I’m still alive to tell you this story, I think you can guess which one happened first. Or at least I’m still alive for a little while longer. Unfortunately, by now I’m running on borrowed time, I suppose you could say. And by the end you’ll know why. But my limited time left on this earth is exactly why I’m writing. After all, isn’t that why we humans do most things that require effort?

On Friday of that first week, I had almost gotten caught. I had actually spent a little too much time watching the T-Series vs. Pewdiepie subscriber count.  That and what bits and pieces of Meme Review or LWIAY I could fit in.  Plus all kinds of other YouTube bullshit from Mr. Beast or Markiplier or anybody else that I didn’t usually get to watch since one or both of my parents were pretty much always in their room at every other time of day.

I always watched with the sound off and subtitles on since I didn’t wanna risk mom hearing my YouTube videos from her shower, and I didn’t have any earphones or headphones to use instead. The noise of the water hitting the floor should’ve pretty much drowned out any sound from my phone, but since the bathroom and my parents’ room are right across from each other, with only a hallway separating them, the sound still didn’t have very far to travel. It also helped to keep the sound off since I could listen to the sound of the water from her shower and know she was still in there. 

But like I said, on Friday I pushed my luck a bit too far. I heard the sound of the water stop and I knew mom’s shower had to have stopped too. I immediately put the phone back where I found it and hoped she wouldn’t notice that the battery had dipped down to 87% when it had been at 100% previously. I figured she’d still need to towel herself off so I had some time to make a break for it. I rushed across the room and opened the door carefully. It had a habit of squeaking just loud enough to be a problem. But I got lucky. It didn’t make a sound. Breakfast was on the table. The moment mom had gotten out of the bathroom, my butt hit the chair and she had no idea I’d been sneaking phone time in her room.

At school, the Valentine’s Day dance was coming up that night. I heard Truman talking to some friends about how he had broken up with his girlfriend, Anastasia Bowman, the day before. Which seemed especially heartless since today was the 15th, which meant the day before was Valentine’s Day itself. At first, I tried to just stay under the radar as usual when around him, but then I realized something: I might actually need his attention for once.

Truman talking about his breakup jogged my memory back to Monday’s detention and how I’d seen the heart with BT and AB in it. Hearing about the breakup also reminded me that he sat in that very same desk every day. Maybe he saw the post-it note. Maybe he looked up the string of characters on the internet too. Maybe he had downloaded the app. Maybe he had answers.

As much as the Valentine’s Day themed decorations that the school had put up over the past week to promote the dance made me wanna puke, I couldn’t focus on that for the rest of the day. I had to be singularly focused on getting Truman’s attention and ask him what he knew about the post-it note. Unfortunately, our paths didn’t really cross very often throughout the day. Obviously he had to swing by my locker in between his third and fourth period.  But ever since the backpack incident on Monday, he’d never talked to me since.

What I really needed was to get him alone. The problem was that he was always with his goons wherever he went.  They wouldn’t understand at all. They’d have no idea about anything. Truman would have to play dumb just to not look like a fucking lunatic in front of all his lackeys, even if he DID know something useful.

Fortunately, at the end of the school day, just after 7th period, Truman walked alone to the bus without any of his friends since they all took a different class for 7th period from the one that he took, and none of them took the bus since most people lived close enough to the school to just walk. I had my chance. I wouldn’t have another for at least another 3 days. I had to act. I ran up behind him and started tapping him on the shoulder. He immediately turned around and looked pretty pissed off. I guess he must’ve assumed I was trying to pull the ol’ “made ya look” trick by tapping him on the shoulder to try and make him look stupid when he turned around.

I froze. I had no idea what I was going to say. Like “Hey, you wouldn’t happened to have found a completely innocuous post-it note in your desk which, upon further investigation, led to a cell phone app that is impossible to delete and that also miraculously managed to spawn a fucking clock of doom in your bedroom, would you?” My whole situation sounded so stupid. How was I gonna tell someone else about it?

“Um… did you see the post-it note in your desk?” I asked very timidly and lamely

“The fuck are you talking about, Stanley? You leave me some kinda faggy love letter?”, Truman replied.

Sidenote: Stanley is my last name, not my first name. Truman would call everyone by their last name. And everyone called him by his last name in return. My first name is Morgan. Pretty sure I haven’t actually told you guys my name yet. Thought now might be a good time. Anyway, back to my cringey conversation with Truman.

“Well, close, but not exactly. Ya see, I actually didn’t put the note there at all. And it also doesn’t really have words on it, just a bunch of, like, letters and numbers and shit…” I trailed off.

“Quit fucking with me or you’ll be eating your asshole for breakfast tomorrow”. So that was that. I got Truman alone. And even then he still had no idea what the fuck I was talking about. Which sucked. Because who else could I go to for answers? I knew how to survive. But I didn’t want to just survive. I wanted things to just go back to normal. Someone else had to have seen that note. Someone would have to be able to help me out here.

Even though it was Friday afternoon, that didn’t mean anything to me since my dad had made sure that I understood that “one week” meant the weekend too.  So I was looking at an absolutely off-the-wall weekend of doing fuck all. So yeah, even more pitiful than a usual weekend for me. But at least come Monday, I wouldn’t need to sneak my phone usage and I could just use it in my room. For once, I was actually looking forward to a Monday.

When I got home, dad still wasn’t home. Mom was home since she only worked part-time, but she was in her room watching TV and talking to some girlfriends from high school on the phone. I was wondering if maybe I could at least watch some TV on the television in our living room. 

Yes, I had been grounded from electronics. But TV was still a grey area. It did require electricity, yes, but it wasn’t the sort of thing you would need to charge. And you couldn’t go use the internet on it. Or at least you couldn’t on ours.  I guess nowadays on some TVs you can do that, but my parents never had anything like that set up. And it wasn’t a hand-held device like my phone or switch. But then again, my laptop wasn’t hand-held either and that was off limits too. But still, it wasn’t portable.

Either way, I figured it couldn’t hurt to test the boundaries. Dad wasn’t home and mom was distracted in her and dad’s room, so even if TV was off limits, it wasn’t like anyone was gonna catch me for a while. At least not until dad came home. Or until mom left her room to go to the bathroom or something, in which case she could potentially hear the TV from the living room. But even if I did get caught, I could always explain how it wasn’t really clear based on the word “electronics” if TV counted or not.

I usually never watched TV, but since it was the only form of entertainment at my disposal, I enjoyed it way more than I ever did before I got grounded. Usually I’d be on my phone or laptop browsing the internet in my free time. Watching YouTube, checking Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, hell I even still used my Facebook account now and then when I got especially bored. Or if not that, then I’d play some Zelda or Kingdom Hearts games on my Nintendo Switch. So TV was pretty low down there on my list of preferred pass-times. But it’s like they say: “beggars can’t be choosers”.

The closest thing to TV I ever watched were these little snippets from shows on TLC that they upload to YouTube. Shows like 90-day fiancé, My 600-pound life, Dr. Pimple Popper.  Just a bunch of garbage TV like that which could, for whatever reason, keep me mildly entertained awhile. So, I spent the next 2 or 3 hours or so watching shows like that on TLC until Dad came home. He immediately turned off the TV after coming home. He asked me why I was watching TV when I knew I was grounded, so I explained how I was only grounded from electronics and I didn’t know TV counted too.

Mom came out from her bedroom to greet dad now that he had come home. Which was good since dad said that I was grounded for another week for watching TV while already grounded, but mom was there to come to my defense and vouch for me. She said she agreed that the word “electronics” doesn’t usually include stuff like TV. Since Mom was on my side, dad gave it up and I was set to be ungrounded the upcoming Monday, just like before. I just couldn’t watch TV until then either.

Soon it was time for dinner, and when dinner was over, I was back to my room with nothing to do but watch the clock turn red and try to kill me. Except that night, something weird had happened: the clock was still the same color as it was during the day. Maybe the thing inside was trying to get me to lower my guard. For the past 4 nights, like literal clockwork, the clock had gotten red, started to glow, the face started to appear, and then by midnight it would break out of the clock and I’d be cowering under the covers like a little bitch, staying totally still, not even breathing. But that wasn’t happening tonight. What the hell was going on?

The monster had to have been up to something. Whether it was trying to lull me into a false sense of security or maybe building up strength for its next attack, I didn’t like where this was all going. 9 o’clock came. No red color. 10 o’clock came. Still no glowing. 11 o’clock came. The face didn’t appear. I had guessed whatever it was had taken the night off. Hey, maybe even horrifying clock demons need some R&R sometimes, right?

Finally, the clock struck midnight. Nothing. Not the slightest change. Was it over? Had the monster moved on to some other clock? Was it just gonna leave me alone now? I figured it was a fat chance. But it didn’t matter. For the first time in days, I had a night without having to stay totally still with my entire body underneath a blanket all without moving the slightest bit just to live to see another day, come midnight. Fuck getting ungrounded. Just having one whole night without having to worry about anymore clock crap was worth way more to me.

On Saturday morning, I still woke up early because of the routine I had gotten into since Monday. So, I was up at 6:30 AM, just like how I usually was when I had school. My parents were still asleep, so I snuck into their room to look at my phone like I had done during the school week. The lights were out and there still wasn’t the slightest hint of sunlight in the sky coming through their windows. It was still February so there usually wouldn’t have been any sunlight until around 8AM during that time of year in my state. Fortunately, mom and dad had left their bedroom door open. So I didn’t have to open it myself and make noise. 

My plan was to turn the light on in the hallway between the bathroom and their bedroom. That way, I could give myself some light to work with so that way I didn’t bump into anything or knock anything over, and potentially make noise that would wake my parents up. Then, I would take my phone. After that, maybe, I could sneak it up to my room, watch some YouTube with some actual sound for once, and put it back before they woke up. Though, I wasn’t quite sure if the light from the hallway would wake them up or not. 

So I figured that maybe, once I turned on the lights, I’d stay out in the hallway to listen for any sounds of them waking up. And if they did wake up I could just head into the kitchen and act like I was just making myself breakfast or something. Maybe they’d think it a bit suspicious that I was up so early on a Saturday since I usually slept in on weekends.  But on the other hand, maybe they’d be pleasantly surprised instead. It could’ve gone either way. But fortunately, once I turned the hallway light on, I didn’t have to worry about any cover story. They were both still asleep. I went over to the nightstand where my charging phone usually was, but it wasn’t there. My dad’s phone was on that charger. I looked at the other nightstand on the other side of their bed where the other charger was. But Mom’s was on that charger. 

Since my parents had two charging cables in their room, my phone could usually charge while one of their two phones did too. But because on the previous night they had apparently needed both chargers at once, mine wasn’t on either one. I had to do a bit of slow and silent searching around the bedroom, but I did eventually find it. I guess when dad went to charge his phone, he accidentally knocked mine off, because my phone was at the foot of the bedstand that had the charger his phone was using. I turned it on and even though I’m guessing it would’ve had to have been at 100% by the time my dad had taken it off the charger, its battery had dropped down to 35%. Luckily, I had a charger in my room so I could just charge my phone while watching YouTube Videos.

My mom took showers that would last about 15 minutes. So I thought back to the day before, when I was watching YouTube with the sound off in her room while my phone was on the charger. It started at 100% and ended at 87%. If 13% of the battery was drained while I used it for 15 minutes on the charger, then on the charger in my room I should have had about 40 minutes of battery left. But that was while watching YouTube videos. Maybe if I just looked at Reddit or something, I wouldn’t be draining as much battery. 

My first stop was rule34. Ever since my electronics had been taken away, I hadn’t had the opportunity to look at any porn since then, so I knew that, before anything else, I couldn’t waste this opportunity with my phone on anything that I couldn’t jerk off to in case it lost its battery before I got to that. I had never looked at any porn during my mornings in my parents’ room because, number one, I didn’t feel comfortable jerking off in the bed that my parents had probably had sex in plenty of times by that point. And, number two, if I ever was to get caught looking at my phone while grounded, I didn’t want to literally get caught with my pants down.

I spent about 15 or 20 minutes or so on Rule34. Most of that wasn’t jerking off to anything, just looking for something I liked. Once I get going, I can usually finish pretty quickly. The time-consuming part is finding something good. Once I find the right picture, I probably only spend like 2 to 3 minutes at the most. Of course it wasn’t the first time that week I'd played with myself. Since I had pretty much nothing else to do, I had done it plenty of times by then. I just didn’t have anything to look at during all those other times. 

I had hoped that, since I wasn’t watching videos, just pictures, I was saving battery. But unfortunately, after I had taken care of myself my phone was down to 18%. So it was still draining battery just as fast. I knew I would have to let it sit and regain battery, however slowly, or else it would die. I pretty much never let my phone die and I didn’t want to start then. It was just something I’d get irrationally anal over. And I would soon find out that that would prove very useful.

The problem was, mom and dad were gonna wake up, and maybe they’d notice that my phone wasn’t in their room anymore. But then again, maybe not. When I found my phone, it had been on the floor. I figured they probably didn’t know exactly where on the floor to check for it, so maybe it wasn’t really a problem after all. But even then. On Monday, Dad was supposed to give me my electronics back. And he wouldn’t be able to do that if my phone wasn’t in his room. I’d still have access to my phone, sure. But he would have to wonder how I managed to get it back if it wasn’t from him. So, at least at some point during that weekend, I’d have to sneak the phone back. That way, when I started using it again after my grounding was over, dad wouldn’t have to wonder where I got it from if he hadn’t given it back to me himself.

My parents got up for the day and didn’t seem to notice that my phone wasn’t in their room anymore. So luckily, I’d at least get to hang onto it until some point on Sunday night. Meaning that my grounding was pretty much unofficially over already. I still didn’t have my laptop or Nintendo Switch. I still didn't know exactly where my parents were keeping those. But if I really wanted to, I could probably do some more snooping around in their room while they were asleep.  There would only be so many places for them to have kept them.  And besides, I least had my phone. Even if its battery was draining exceptionally fast.

Throughout the day, I started to wonder if I even wanted my phone back. Because of its horrendous battery life, I had to spend like half the day waiting for it recharge. Hopefully my laptop and switch wouldn’t have this problem also.  Though I didn’t see any reason for them to. After all, I had downloaded the sleep app on my phone, not my laptop or switch.

I checked the app again. Since I didn’t have to hide from my clock, I was curious to see if the number on the app went up by 10 again. Strangely enough, it had. The number was up to 50. “Maybe I’ll get something when I reach 100”, I had thought to myself. Or maybe, the number on the app had nothing to do with the clock at all. Maybe these had been entirely unrelated things this whole time. Even though I had come to grips with the fact that the monster was real, it still might’ve had nothing to do with my new app. But I found that hard to believe.
