I didn’t really know my grandparents very well, but that’s because I grew up in the States and they remained in Tokyo when we left. 

When he passed away, I got the news via FaceTime. My mom was in tears because it was so sudden. I was kinda numb to the whole thing. Busy with college and making sure I could work to handle the rising debt I was acquiring in San Francisco, their death didn’t impact as much as I guess it should have when she showed me the obituary. 

Hikaro Watsune, age 76. It was like looking at the picture of a stranger. How was I supposed to grieve when he had never made himself a part of my life? 

Truthfully I wasn’t paying attention until Ma asked for my dorm room number. 

“That is quite an odd request,” I told her. 

She told me there were a few things that he wanted me to have from the old country. 


“What is it? Old sweaters or something?” I asked. Ma shrugged, clearly still struggling with the tragedy. I didn’t wish to cause her any more hardship so I gave her the info and thought nothing more of it. 

Four days later, a package arrived. Covered in postage from all across the world, Grandfather had certainly gone through a lot of effort to send whatever was inside. 

I placed it on my firm mattress and used my car keys to open the little package. There was wrapping paper inside with a note attached to it. Written in Grandfather’s Japanese. 

I placed it aside, deciding to translate it later; and unwrapped the item inside the box. 

It was some kind of children’s storybook, written entirely in ancient Japanese, probably even older than the kind that Grandfather was familiar with. 

It wasn’t too heavy, but clearly very fragile and I immediately wondered why he had sent me something like this. 

Placing the book down carefully I got on my phone and used Google to translate his handwritten note to the best of my ability. 

I know it’s shameful that I have never learned my mother tongue, but honestly there has never been a need. 

*My dear Akio-chan, I am old and dying. I miss the days of my childhood when I could hold you and bounce you on my knee and tell you these fanciful stories and your eyes would twinkle.*

*You remember nothing of this of course, taken from me far too young. Ever since i have been unable to reach you and tell you there is more to this fable than meets the eye.* 

*I give it to you so that you may learn the truth about your family’s heritage. Do not tell anyone or all will be lost.*


It was signed at the bottom and he even included a thumbprint in ink as a seal, perhaps his way of verifying that he really did send it. 

The note confounded me more than the book. 

I did not have any memory of life in Japan, nor was I aware that my grandfather had been trying to contact me for years. 

I instinctively started to dial my mom, but then I looked at the translation again. 

Grandpa sounded paranoid, perhaps delusional. I didn’t really know what his mental state was at the end. 

But what if there was some truth to the words? 

I hadn’t spoken to Ma in a while since coming to the states, and while I felt she loved me… this was all very new and strange. Maybe it was sixth sense or something, but I didn’t finish the call. 

I instead decided to take the storybook to one of my professors. 

Doctor Calheed majored in archaeology and when I explained what I had, he was instantly intrigued and agree to meet after class the next day. 

When he saw the book, he was immediately impressed and told me that even Without starting to do carbon dating,  it was clear that this book was over two hundred years old. 

He seemed shocked my grandfather had chosen to no donate it to a museum and a little disappointed that I decided to hang on to it for now. 

“How long do you think it would take to translate?” I asked. 

He told me that his specific studies couldn’t help but maybe if he took a Few snapshots of different pages, he might be able to get some of his colleagues to help out. 

I thought that was harmless and we chose a few of the pages that had more text on them than illustration, and once I was finished I decided to call my girlfriend and go out to dinner. 

Out of caution for the book’s value, I stopped by my dorm and placed it in an old safe that had been handed down from another relative. Ironic that these two antiques were now guarding one another, I thought.  

During our meal, I told her the interesting find and she was in awe of the story. 

Her first reaction was to suggest that I attempt to sell it. I knew that if it really was old that could be enough to cover my college, and perhaps have some left over. It was a tempting thought but it made me feel guilty. 

“Come on, it’s an heirloom. Besides, grandpa seemed to think that it would help me learn more about my family history.” 

That intrigued her more especially because she wondered if it was true why my mother hadn’t already told me the story herself. 

“Not sure yet. I’m sure it will amount to nothing though. Probably just a harmless fairy tale,” I laughed. 

That night, I was surprised to find that my professor had already emailed me the first parts of the story. Immediately I began to read, it was an interesting account from all the way back in the 7th century. 

*The Star Princess*

*Just as the sun rises in the east, and sets in the west, the great warriors protect our lands from all evil great and far.*

*Namaro Watsune was one such samurai, of the lowest family in the remotest part of the Kingdom.*

I paused as I reread the name of the warrior in the book. 

Watsune. My family name… 

I kept reading, slightly more interested now as the story told of what happened to Watsune.

*One day, while in the midst of a duel with his aging father, Namaro saw something in the distant sky. It was a shooting star he thought at first. Then he saw that it was a falling boat. A chariot from the Heavens!*

I saw the artistic depiction of the strange ship that my ancestors claimed to have seen, and noted that the professor claimed it bore a striking resemblance to other ancient works, particularly a drawing from 1844. 

He sent me the link and I did realize there was a bit of a similarity except the one in the story book looked more like an egg than a spinning top. 

Alongside the link was a word.  Utsoro-bune. 

The email ended with a promise that he would continue the translation tomorrow. 

Meanwhile I did some internet research of my own, discovering that the strange ship was considered an old legend from the Kōno tribe, and related to a fisherman from Gogo Island. 

That was a name I recognized. It was the place my mother grew up near. Grandfather claimed our family had been there for generations. 

My phone rang, disturbing my research. It was my mother. 

“Akio, are you awake at this hour?” she asked. Her voice sounded a bit concerned. 

“I’m alright ma. What is wrong? Why are you calling?” I asked. 

“Nakia called me, she said that you found something interesting from Pa’s things,” Ma said. 

For a moment I froze, realizing that I had never considered my girlfriend would contact her. 

“It’s nothing ma,” I mumbled. 

“Akio, do not lie to me. A mother can always tell when her son is lying. It was a book, wasn’t it?” 

How did she know that? I said nothing, and I heard her sigh heavily on the phone. 

“Your grandfather has been obsessed with that for ages. I really didn’t want you roped into his nonsense,” she whispered. 

“Is that why you kept him from contacting me?” I asked. There was a long pause, long enough for me to suspect that there was more to the story she was withholding from me. 

“The book is meaningless, Akio. Don’t waste your time with it,” she told me. 

I paused, a few things feeling wrong about the entire situation. 

“So… you called me up at one o’clock in the morning… to warn me to just get rid of a children’s storybook?” 

She didn’t answer this time so I prodded her and remarked, “What exactly is so important about it Ma?” 

“It should have been burned long ago!” 

Then she hung up the phone. 

I laid against the headboard of my bed, a bit baffled by her words. Was she frightened by what I might learn? Or was there something else going on that I didn’t understand? 

Somehow despite those troubling thoughts, I managed to sleep. 

When I did, I dreamed of my ancestor from that ancient story. 

I was on a war torn battlefield. I could see many warriors dressed in the shining armor of the samurais of old. Iron and leather and painted with familiar Clan colors from Japan, the warriors were all fighting each other to the death in a war that made the ground red with blood. 

Natsuno though, barely had anything to protect himself with and an army was coming down to destroy his home. All of his traditional armor had been stripped, and it seemed like he had nothing to stop this strange enemy that pushed through the land like a flood. 

To his side, I saw a strange young girl with pale skin and dark hair. She had eyes that were as bright as the sun and she was whispering something to him but I didn’t understand. His long katana was glowing with blood and filled with twinkling stars as he closed his eyes and then put on a helmet. 

He turned his blade to me, his eyes now as black as a demons. 

“The Stars awaken. Behold the darkest day,” he said as he ran his blade straight through my belly. 

I awoke with a cold sweat and instinctively grabbed my stomach, pulling my sheets back to look down and make sure I wasn’t injured. 

Just a dream…. 

But it felt so real. 

My laptop was still on, and my professor had emailed me the next part of the story. 

*Meet with me once you finish. A few of my colleagues are interested in learning more.* a note attached to the translation said. 

I opened the pdf and felt a chill run down my spine. 

There was an illustration of an ancient battle, of the Kōno clan against an army of shadows from the sky. Demons that were coming to kill a young woman that matched the girl I saw in my dreams. 

What had happened in that tale, made me begin to question my reality. 

*Natsuno was not strong or brave, but the Star Princess gave him both. Promises of a future Kingdom that would rule all of The Kingdoms of Earth. They were in love, but the Star Demons did not approve. They sought her blood and the blood of the entire clan. Natsuno would have to face them alone to protect his family.* 

*Natsuno was given the powers of the stars and struck down millions of the demons with a single blade. He did not falter. But as a result of his strength, he lost his mortal life. As the last demon tried to strike him down, Natsuno was given a final task. To give birth to his son, sinless and pure.*

The depiction of the man bursting open and a child hovering and glowing from his Bowels didn’t make this feel like it was a child’s story but rather a gory war story with a strange supernatural ending. 

Had this been what would happen next in the dream? Why had I depicted these scenes so vividly in my subconscious when I had never seen them? 

Reading the story felt like I was opening a door in my mind. Some memory I never remembered being planted in my mind. 

Again at the end of the pdf, my professor reminded me to meet him that afternoon for more discussion. His urgency told me there had to be something else he had uncovered and my troubled dreams made me eager to find out what it could be. 

I met him at a library alongside three men that I didn’t know. I was actually surprised when I saw that they were all Japanese and instinctively I gave them the customary bow for their culture. 

“Akio, I’m glad you could make it… these are associates I have contacted about your find. They came as soon as they heard of its importance,” my professor said excitedly. 

For a moment I panicked. I had hoped he wouldn’t involve anyone else, but these men all seemed dignified and reasonable, so I sat with them as they began to talk. 

They told me that they had determined that the book grandfather had in his possession was from 1805, probably crafted directly on Gogo Island, the first man said. The second man was a bit older and coughed into his hand. 

“As I’m sure you no doubt have realized, this is a priceless artifact that belongs to the people of Japan. We would like to return it to Tokyo immediately.” 

“There would be a small finder’s fee. After all, Hikaro ensured that this story would be able to endure the test of time,” the third man said. 

I paused, my eyes flickering for a moment. 

“What did you say?” I asked. 

The first man repeated the offer, saying they wished to offer compensation for finding this national treasure. 

“No. Not that. You mentioned my grandfather’s name. How do you know that?” I asked. 

The three men exchanged glances and even my professor seemed a bit puzzled, asking if I ever met these men before. 

Those were the last words he ever spoke. 


The second man had taken out a gun and shot him straight between the eyes. The sound was so loud it made my ears ring. I was in such shock, I didn’t realize they were pointing the weapon at my head next. The man was mouthing words and shouting but I couldn’t hear him at first. 

My flight or fight instinct took over and I kicked the table up, pushing the three men backward. 

As I looked down at my professor’s dead eyes, I mumbled an apology and ran. 

Immediately I could hear the faint rumble of their feet. 

They were pursuing me. 

I ran to the second floor of the library, weaving between the aisles until I found a broom closet and hid within. 

The shuffling of feet eventually subsided and I knew that they were gone. 

After a few more moments, my racing heart began to calm and I looked down at my shirt that was now covered in my professor’s blood. 

What was so important about that book they would want to kill for it? 


_______

Once I left the library, I felt that I had a target on my back and I didn’t even know why. Those men were hunting for me and I needed to get into my professor’s office and find the rest of the notes he had managed to make. 

I made my way to campus that evening, calling Nakia to help. I promised her a cut of the reward, lying and saying I was selling the book to a museum. 

“So it’s really worth a lot huh?” she asked as we went down the corridor toward the professor's office. 

“More than you could possibly imagine. Now can you shimmey the lock or not?” I asked as I kept watch. 

The school was mostly empty of students at this hour but I felt the need to be paranoid. 

Thankfully she was able to get it open in only a few minutes. 

She asked me what we were supposed to be looking for as we flipped on the lights. 

I scanned the room and saw a few pages of notes on his desk, rifling through them. Then I noticed a few interesting news articles. The headlines made me pause. 

*Doomsday Cult responsible for death of 13 in subway incident.*

*Leader of cult claims divine judgment was given from above. End of world by 1997*

*Last members of the cult were executed for crimes. Some suspect splinter groups still exist to await the Return* 

I wasn’t sure what all of it meant but I saw that he had made a small board that connected claims by this cult leader to the story of the Utsorobune. 

Able to float on air? Seeing visions of heavenly women that were giving him direct guidance? 

And the Beast of biblical Revelation was said to be an invasion that only he could smite with the power of his ancestors. 

My ancestors, I realized as I finally found the notes of Natsuno’s story. 

*The child, a son of man and of gods, was hidden from the world. The Star Princess claimed that his lineage would bring about the End of the World, when the Return brought him into the light again. And she would come back as well.* 

There was a depiction of the ancestor, glowing in an ethereal way along with a heavenly woman watching over him. For some reason it made me feel very uneasy to look down at the ancient translation. What did it all mean for me? 

“Akio, isn’t this your grandfather?” I heard my girlfriend ask as she held up a picture of the trial of the cult leader from a Tokyo newspaper. 

In the background at the court, I saw Hikaro. 
2018, only a few years ago. 

“Why was he there?” Nakia asked. 

“I’m not sure… but I think I know who can give me the answers,” I said as I realized that going to my mother was the only option I had. 

“Nakia you must come with me. It isn’t safe here,” I told her. 

She seemed frightened by the idea that a mere children’s book could hold such power. 

“People have been killed already because of it. I think it’s telling a dark secret and they don’t want it to come to light,” I explained. 

She pushed me away, clearly troubled. 

She told me we should destroy it, and let it die alongside my grandfather. 

I was surprised by her boldness, but the idea did make a certain amount of sense. And maybe the people that were coming after me would stop if we destroyed it. 

“Meet me at my house tonight. We can burn it and then just forget all about this,” she said as she kissed me. 

I grabbed the notes from my professor's desk and rushed home to get the book. Honestly I wasn’t sure it was going to be safe anywhere until it was gone. 

As I traveled I felt constantly followed or watched. Suddenly everyone around me no longer seemed trustworthy. 

As I traveled to Nakia’s house, I listened to more notes relating to the Star Princess, and it troubled me. 

“Many claim that ancestors from the clan related to Natsuno are descended from the Star child itself. The warrior that was born from heaven that will cause the end of the world. The Star Princess, some believers testify, still walks among us immortal. And there are shadows among men, that do her will. The demons from heaven, some theorists claim, were her own people. They saw the danger of the child, the danger of her arrival in the Utsorobune.*

*Her ancestors are a threat to all mankind and must be eliminated, some extremists have proclaimed.*

The words were stunning to read. If they were true… 

Did this explain why those men wanted me dead? 

Was Natsuno a harbinger of evil? And if grandfather had learned this secret, why hasn't he tried to stop this ages ago? What had changed in recent years? 

As soon as I got there, Nakia pulled me inside asking if I had the book. 

“Yes but honestly I’m not sure about destroying it anymore. It feels like this has more secrets than just my family,” I told her. 

Nakia disagreed, insisting that it would only bring bad luck and tried to snatch my pack from my hands. 

I asked her how she could be so quick to destroy such an important artifact. “What I have read might change the shape of history as we know it,” I told her. 

She apologized and admitted she was just nervous to lose me, especially after what had happened at the library. She promised to not pressure me as we sat down and I examined the last few chapters of the book. Without a translator it was hard to guess what was happening. 

I saw the strange dark creatures from the stars swarming across the surface of the earth. And I saw the glowing woman from ancient times emerging from the ground. 

Except this time it was plainly obvious the demons were coming from her. So she had become their host? Or was she the cause of the problem all along?

“I think we might have gotten the story wrong… I think this visitor from ancient times infected mankind… waiting to spread her evil across generation after generation,” I whispered. 

I looked up to see what my girlfriend had to say but she had gone to the next room so I put the book down and followed her in there, surprised to see that she was undressing. She insisted I come to bed with her and pulled me close, kissing me tenderly. I guessed it had been the recent string of events that had caused this sudden passion, but only a few moments later I was proven wrong. 

She was reaching for something in her cabinet, and at first I thought it was a condom. Then I saw a syringe, filled with strange black pus. 

I fumbled backward as she grabbed it and realized that this rendezvous was never about helping me at all. 

“Who are you? Are you involved in this too?” 

Holding the syringe close to her body, her voice changed and she claimed that she needed to kill me to protect my children. As long as the heirs of Natsuno were alive, her prodigy were a danger. 

Her eyes rolled back and began to glow. Her hair turned white and her body burst with stars and strange tendrils of fire. 

She was the Star Princess. 

She told me she had hunted me and my family for ages, trying to find every last member and kill them all. The only ones that still knew of her secret. 

And then she lunged to attack. She was so strong, I doubt even ten men could hold her down. 

Somehow I managed to break free and ran toward the living room, grabbing the book and running to the door. 

Nakia was right behind me, using her superhuman powers to pull me down and slam me to the ground. I was sure that I would likely die in the next few moments if I didn’t act quickly. Her teeth were dripping poison and burning my skin. 

In that brief moment I had an opening and I managed to push my body against hers and the syringe plunged into her neck. I injected the poison and her eyes turned from glowing to black and dead. She collapsed on the ground beside me as I stumbled and ran from the house. 

I haven’t stopped running ever since. The book, it is so valuable but not for just money. I believe it reveals of a secret invasion to our planet. My girlfriend is proof. I don’t think the star princess will be dead for long if the prophecy is to turn out true. 

And now as I travel, in hopes of finding others who know more, and can help me, I fear that I trust no one. The final notes from Calheed told me this much. My assumption of the end of the tale was correct. Natsuno was a hybrid, but the demons of the stars were born of the princess to do her bidding and to hunt down this new land and claim it. 

Not just the Kōno tribe, but perhaps others, even millions could be infected with this alien menace now. It had been hundreds of years, I realized as I reconsidered destroying the book. But I can’t. It might be the only thing keeping me alive. This secret is too powerful to remain quiet. 

As a warning to others, I think it’s best to realize the people of this earth are not all human. Ancient evil walks among us, and only my family has the key to possibly stopping them. If we even can. If we haven’t already been found out. 

I say this because I also traveled to my ma, realizing that despite grandfather’s warning I needed to learn more. And when I arrived at her house I found that she had experienced a break in. And she had been murdered. Smelling her rotting flesh and seeing how these inhuman creatures tore her apart will be scarred into my memory for as long as I live. 

But it will also serve as a warning that I can’t let my guard down. The book must be protected until I find a way to stop them. Until then I run, run and hide. 

And I suggest everyone that knows this secret do the same.
