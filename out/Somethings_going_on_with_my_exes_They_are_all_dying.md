The uber driver was already waiting at my door when I saw the group chat.

It was just me and two other friends from our dorm days, but they’d been flooding the thread with messages before I finally opened it.

>kat: can you believe this?! aaron died this monday.

It caught me off guard. Aaron was my boyfriend back in college—we were together for two years.

>me: Oh my God!! How did it happen?

>anna: I heard it was suicide

>kat: whaaaat

>me: no way

>anna: yes... weird, right? he was such a fun guy

The news hit me hard, but I was already running late. So I shoved my phone in my bag, stepped out into an annoying cold night, and got into the car.

The driver seemed irritated with the delay and didn’t say a word, just pulled off.

I checked my phone again. No news from the girls.

I opened Aaron’s Facebook page and scrolled through his old photos—many from when we were still together. Kept wondering if he could’ve really done it.

His young smile in one blurry concert pic from some crappy indie band made it hard to believe. But who was I to know?

The car kept turning street after street until it hit the main avenue toward the restaurant. By then, I’d already spiraled down the photo rabbit hole in my phone— even digging through my own profile.

I swiped and swiped, probably went back fifteen years in time. Found pics of teenage me at some random house party, hiding out with friends.

And there right beside me was Joshua, my first boyfriend back in my hometown.

He was *that* guy—the jerk boyfriend everyone dates at least once. And I did it in high school, for one year.

Curiosity kicked in, and I decided to look his profile up too. Didn’t take long to find it.

But something felt off instantly. His profile picture was pitch black, and his tagged photos… were from a funeral?

His funeral. Posted just a week ago.

What the hell.

\*\*\*

Still stuck in traffic, I texted my mom—she knew Joshua’s parents.

>mom: yes honey his mother is heartbroken

>me: can't believe it... how did it happen?  
mom: your uncle lives close to them and said it was suicide

My eyes widened. 

Two exes dead. Both suicides in the span of a week.

What were the odds?

“We’re here,” the driver said—clearly annoyed that I was still sitting in his back seat.

I stepped out, still numb, trying to make sense of it all. The restaurant’s doorman held the door open, and I walked in, eyes scanning for my date.

And soon I found him, sitting in the corner, already holding a glass of wine. I walked over and he greeted me with a warm hug.

This was our third date. We’d been talking for about a month now, between all the traveling his job demanded.

He was nice and smart. A tall man with a stable job and shoulders wide enough to wrap me up twice.

But I wasn’t quite sure how I felt about him.

I sat down and he topped off my glass. “How about some appetizers? Heard they make a great carpaccio.”

“That’d be great,” I replied automatically, barely glancing at the menu. I wasn’t really there mentally.

I soon made up an excuse about work and picked up my phone again. Something terrible had crossed my mind, tying together everything from today.

What about Tim?

My last and longest relationship, we ended just over six months ago, after almost seven years together. We even got engaged, and to be honest, I still cared for him deeply.

So, I texted him.

>me: Hi Tim. I know this is a weird thing to ask but are you ok?

The second I hit send, I regretted it. We hadn’t spoken since the breakup, and promised not to. Now I was breaking that for... what? A gut feeling?

Right when the message delivered, I heard the vibration.

Coming from across the table.

From his pocket. My date's.

And he didn’t flinch, just kept scrolling through appetizer options like nothing happened.

Just a coincidence. It *had* to be.

I got up, unsure of my own thoughts, and said I needed to use the bathroom. He looked up, surprised by how fast I stood.

“You okay?”

I nodded with a forced smile and walked out.

The restroom was just a single stall, and I got in, locking the door behind me.

Checked my phone again and saw no reply from Tim.

I didn’t feel safe calling him—so I called his sister instead. We stayed friends even after the breakup, and she picked it up immediately.

“Hi, Tina. I’m sorry to call you so abruptly, but…” I began explaining.

“Thank God you called. I was just about to call you too,” she cut in. Her voice was tight, anxious.

“Tim’s been missing all week. We’ve been trying to reach him, I even tried his house and job.”

I went silent. Something *was* happening.

“Have you seen or talked to him?” she asked.

I told her I hadn’t, and she asked if I could talk to some mutual friends to check.

“I will,” I promised. “I’ll ask around.”

I ended the call and took a deep breath before I grabbed the doorknob to open the door out.

But when I did, he was standing right there. The date. Right in front of the door.

He smiled. “I had to go too, finished, and figured I’d wait for you out here.”

*Who the hell does that?* Is what I thought with an awkward smile on my face. 

He turned and walked back toward our table, and I followed a few steps behind his huge frame. Still processing what was happening.

My head was spinning. This couldn't be a coincidence.

Something *was* going on with all of my ex-boyfriends.

At the table, the man tried talking about something—work, music, or the desserts—but I wasn’t listening. My eyes kept flicking back to my phone, hoping for updates on Tim.

So I decided I couldn’t stay there. I slipped my phone into my bag, and muttered an apology.  “I’m sorry. Something came up at work and I have to go.”

His expression changed instantly. From polite to... disappointed. Before I could get up, he grabbed my wrist.

“I don’t think Tim will like that you’re leaving now.”

A chill ran through me. I had never told him about Tim.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

He stared at me, unmoving.

“I mean he won’t like what’s going to happen to him in my garage tonight if you walk away.”

I dropped back into my seat, eyes locked on his, mouth half-open in surprise.

That’s when the server came by with the carpaccio. She placed the plate down, smiled politely, and walked away.

He immediately picked up a slice and began eating, as if nothing had happened. I didn’t touch mine, obviously.

It took some time but I found the courage to talk first. “Did you do something to Joshua and Aaron?”

“I did what I had to do to make you *perfect*,” he said, still chewing.

“What do you mean?”

He finally set his fork down, wiped his mouth with the napkin, and looked straight at me.

“I fell in love the second I saw your photo on that app,” his voice now tender. “Swiped right instantly and after our first date, I followed you home. And I started going through every record I could find about you. Every photo, profile, friends, exes... “

He casually paused to take a sip of wine like what he had just said wasn't batshit crazy.

"I needed to know if you could really be, you know, the one," he said, his expression suddenly grave and focused. "It's a shame you had such a mark in your story... exes. "

"Especially Tim—poor guy still had hope," he sneered, a grim look spreading across his face. "Not that he was eager to tell me. I had to be... persuasive to get him to admit it."

I was too stunned to speak.

My instincts screamed for me to run out of there as fast as I could—but I was still worried about what would happen to Tim.

“Please, just don’t do anything to him. Let him go.”

He gave a wide smile. Calm.

“Don’t worry about him,” he added, playfully. “I was joking when I told you about the garage. I already took care of him before I got here. You are *perfect* now.”

My hands flew to my mouth, and my eyes instantly filled with shock.

Too numb to scream, I just watched as he stood up from his chair and knelt right in front of me.

The whole restaurant quickly turned to watch him pull a small box from his pocket and open it.

An engagement ring. Gold but simple, with a small embedded diamond.

The kind of ring someone on a tight budget would buy—a guy who probably emptied his savings from a dead-end job just to afford it.

And I knew that because it was the exact ring Tim had given me. The one I gave back when I ended it [all.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Accomplished_Low7889/)
