I’ve never been the kind of person to post on here, but I need to get this out. Maybe someone can give me advice, or at least tell me I’m not going crazy.

About a week ago, I decided to go for a hike. I live in a pretty rural area, so there’s a lot of forest around. I’ve been on this particular trail a million times, so I didn’t think much of it when I veered off to explore a little deeper into the woods. It wasn’t anything dangerous—just curiosity. The deeper I went, the more isolated it felt, like the forest had swallowed up the world behind me.

After about 20 minutes, I noticed something strange. There was this weird, musty smell, almost like a mix of damp earth and something… off. It was subtle at first, but the deeper I went, the stronger it got. I figured it was just a dead animal. But then I saw something up ahead—a bundle, lying between the trees.

At first, I thought it was just some trash. Maybe someone had dumped old clothes or camping gear. But as I got closer, my stomach sank. It was a body. A man, maybe in his 30s, face-down in the dirt. His clothes were filthy and torn, and his skin was pale. There were bruises on his arms, deep purple and black, like he’d been grabbed or restrained.

I froze. My brain couldn’t process it. My first instinct was to call someone, but as I reached for my phone, I realized something was wrong. There were no signs of a struggle—no blood, no torn-up ground. The body looked like it had been placed there.

And that’s when I felt it. The sensation of being watched. My skin crawled. Slowly, I looked around, scanning the trees, but I didn’t see anyone. The woods were deathly quiet. No birds, no rustling leaves—just this oppressive, heavy silence.

I didn’t stick around. I bolted. I didn’t even think about calling the cops until I was halfway back to my car. But the second I pulled out my phone, I stopped. There was a strange feeling in my gut, like if I reported it, I’d be dragging myself into something I didn’t want to be a part of. So I didn’t call. I know how stupid that sounds. But something told me to just… forget it.

I thought I could move on, but that night, everything changed. When I got home, I started feeling paranoid. Like someone was outside, watching my house. I kept peeking through the blinds, convinced I’d see someone standing under the streetlamp, just staring up at my window. But every time I looked, there was nothing.

The next day, I found footprints in the dirt outside my bedroom window. Bare footprints. Whoever it was, they’d been there while I slept.

I started locking every door and window obsessively, but it didn’t help. No matter how secure I made the house, the feeling stayed. I’d catch glimpses of movement from the corner of my eye—just for a split second—but when I turned, nothing was there. It was like they were toying with me, letting me know they could get close whenever they wanted.

A few nights ago, I woke up to tapping on my window. Light, rhythmic taps, like someone was standing right outside. I didn’t want to look. I was frozen in bed, barely able to breathe. But after a minute, the tapping stopped. I thought maybe I’d imagined it, until I heard it again—this time from the back door. Slow, deliberate knocks.

I don’t know how long I stayed there, too terrified to move, until finally it stopped. When I checked in the morning, there were more footprints in the dirt. This time, they were leading from my window to the door.

I’m scared to sleep. I’m scared to go outside. Whoever—or whatever—this is, they know I saw the body. And now they’re hunting me for it. The worst part is, I feel like they’re playing a game, dragging it out, enjoying the fear.

I don’t know what to do. Should I call the police now, or would that just make it worse? Part of me feels like they want me to, like they’re waiting for me to involve someone else.

I can’t shake the feeling that this is only the beginning.
