For a little bit of context, I (25f) have recently moved into my aunt's old house. She sadly passed away 4 months ago, and in her testimony left me her house because I was the closest to her—and the one she trusted the most—out of me and my sister. I was her main caregiver through her last rough months. 
I had since been very busy with work and didn't have time to move out of my old apartment, until now. 
The first few days went fine, I kept myself occupied with chores and boring tasks that took all my attention but when it was finally time to relax, it happened for the first time. 

I saw her. Not actually saw, saw her but rather "imagined". I dozed off watching TV as I had been very tired of walking around and lifting heavy objects with no help whatsoever, and after mere seconds of closing my eyes, she appeared. She's what would seem to be a normal woman with dark hair in her late forties to early fifties. But it's not as simple as that, of course not, I wouldn't be writing this if that were the case, no. 

What is the most compelling about this woman is her smile. Rather unnatural and scary, but not completely monstrous, just sitting under the "uncanny valley" of expressions. As if she wasn't completely human.

I cannot bring myself to further describe what this woman looks like, as I'm currently avoiding to see her again and would rather not think about it. Please understand me. 

This encounter would be the first of many which simply freaked me out more and more and finally drove me off the edge to be writing this right now. 

At first I had brushed of as stress, but that is far from the truth. 
One would think that maybe it's because of me losing my aunt, but I don't believe so, as I knew it was going to happen and I prepared myself mentally for it beforehand. And may I recall, it was 4 months ago, so I would rule this theory out. 

As I said, it happened again, not long after. I was resting on the couch, scrolling through Reddit on another account and dozed off once more. And there she was, smiling again. That. Awful. Smile.

This time around I noticed something though—as it didn't startle me that much and could discern some more details.  

She looked familiar. 

Not only because this was the second time, but because her, herself, appeared to be. Her black hair—and features, I guess—reminded me of my aunt. 

Don't get confused, the lady is not my aunt at all, she never even got to be that old since she passed at the age of 39 of leukemia. And it's not like it's an old version of her but more like a look-alike.

Upon opening my eyes I closed them off again and she didn't come back.

The third time around was in a dream. In it we were both in the house and standing in the kitchen. She didn't speak to me even when I tried to communicate, but only pointed with her scrawny finger at a white door to the left, no matter what I said. She got angry after some seconds—she had actually changed her expression—and started to run at me.

I woke up before she could get me.

I got curious about the door and after the shock of the moment, walked into the kitchen. I then realized. 

There is no door in there.

There's a blank wall and it wouldn't make sense for a room to be there since there is no space for it to fit. 
I don't know what she was trying to communicate or what even is that door she signaled to. Did she want me to get in? Was it a metaphor? Is this woman real?

Fourth time. I was starting to forget her. I had a tough week at work, and when I got home I decided to take a shower to relax. I closed my eyes, not wanting the shampoo to get in my eyes. The smiling woman, once more. 
It had frightened me so much that I stood there freezing behind the curtains for nearly 20 minutes, hesitant to get out of fear of her materializing right before me. 

I don't know why she has that grip on me, it shouldn't be this scary, it is just a woman. But the fact that she appears out of nowhere, out of the blue, in seemingly random moments, leaves me with a feeling of impeding doom and powerlessness. 

Not even a week later, she visited me in another dream. 

It started with me in the living room. Do you know the feeling of just knowing things in dreams? Well, in it, I just knew I had done something bad and that she was coming for me. 

And I was right. 

Out of the kitchen she came running at me, with a wooden spoon in her hand she later used to slap me hard in the face. She began yelling, stuff I cant remember now, but she was very angry once again. She grabbed my arm with immense force to later strike it hard with the utensil over and over. I cried hard, so hard that when I woke up my face was covered in real tears and with a heart that raced faster than a hummingbird. It felt so... palpable. Not only that but my arm hurt, the same one she harmed. It would later show bruising, but maybe I did it to myself asleep, I don't know.

It's weird because it wasn't a surrealist dream, it's something that could happen and I've encountered before, with my own mother. But it still marked me because as she hit me, she was...  smiling.

The wooden spoon, it's weird, my aunt has something like it but it's more like a fork. They seem to be a part of a set, same colored wood, though it might be missing somewhere. 

I'm embarrassed to say I'm afraid of her, of course she's not real, for god's sake! I know it's just my imagination and my mind playing tricks.
But I am afraid, I'm terrified she might try to get me again, to harm me. I haven't told anyone else and it has been affecting my life completely since I can't get any sleep, only when I'm completely exhausted after being awake for days and basically faint on the couch. 

I don't want to dream about her anymore, I don't want to see her, I don't want to hear her voice. 

I don't know how to cope with all of this, I don't know what to do.

And lately I've been momentarily seeing her with my eyes open, though not directly, through reflections. Behind me through the black mirror of my phone, the TV, even the microwave. Am I hallucinating now? What is happening to me? It could be because I haven't slept since sunday. 

Should I seek professional attention? I wouldn't have the money for it anyways. So I need to find other solutions. That's why I'm here.
I don't have close friends or family to confess this to, my mother hasn't tried to contact me after the funeral—knowing her she'd say I'm tired and brush me off—and my sister moved to another country and I don't want bother her with this.
Maybe it's the house and I should move out, it always kind of gave me the creeps, I should've known this was a bad idea. I'll try asking my mother about it and update here what she tells me, if she even says anything. 

If anyone has any advice on what I should do next or what you think is going on with me, it'd be greatly appreciated. 

I've checked for carbon monoxide leaks and there is none!
