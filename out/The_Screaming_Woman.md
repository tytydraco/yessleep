When my uncle asked me to supervise his cabin for a weekend, I was eager to see it. Ever since I was young, my uncle would come visit my family, which was me, my sister Amelia, my brother Ryan, and my mother. My father passed away when I was young in a tragic accident. I never got to go to his house, my mom said that it was “too cramped” but what if it was just me? I asked before but my mom would always change the subject. 

Anyways, I of course said yes to his offer. I was extremely excited to see the cabin for myself. It was about a 3 hour drive, which I didn’t mind. I was originally going to ask if I could bring my girlfriend, but I had a feeling he was less accepting then my mother. He was from my dad’s side of the family, after he passed away he and my mom got close. Not in a romantic sort of way, just a “I feel bad for you and you feel bad for me” kinda friendship. I called him when I was about to leave, and he told me that there would be a very specific set of rules. I’ve been on reddit a lot recently, so I couldn’t help but thing of the rules horror subreddit. I got on the road at around 3 and arrived at the area at around 6. I started hiking up the hills to find his house, it wasn’t near the forest, it was quite literally located inside the forest, and cars weren’t allowed. I had a feeling that I was going to have to hike, so for once in my life, i packed lightly. Before I officially entered the woods, I called my girlfriend to check in with her.

”Hey Lucy!” She said, almost immediately answering. 

“Hey Angie, I just want to make sure you’re okay. Obviously, I won’t be able to call since there won’t be any wifi so I’ll call you once i’m on my way on Sunday.”

”Aww, okay. I wish I could come. And I’m fine. Well, bye baby, Love you!”

”Love you too,” I hung up the phone, noticing my lock screen and smiling. It was me, Angie, Amelia, my mom, and my brother all sitting at a diner. God, I love Angie. I was planning on proposing. I caught myself to be in a trance, just staring at her beautiful eyes. I shook my head and looked up at the hills above me. I continued hiking up the hills. I felt the grass itch my skin. I felt the autumn breeze pull my dark-brown hair. I continued walking even though I started to feel tired. I checked my phone and there was still 1 bar left, so I called my uncle. It was really delayed and laggy, but I got through it. After another 30 minutes of searching through the woods, I finally arrived at the house.

When I entered, I was met with a disturbing silence. For some reason, I expected my uncle to greet me. Instead, I knocked for a few minutes and then let myself in as the door was unlocked. I had never seen a picture of the house, so I wondered if it was the wrong cabin. It didn’t have a mailbox or anything, not an address. It was just there. I looked around for a little bit, I then placed my 2 bags down. One on the couch, the other on the floor. I yawned and went into the kitchen. There I saw a white lined piece of paper that was taped to the fridge. The rules list. There were 8 rules in total.

1. Don’t leave the cabin after 11pm.
2. Lock all doors and windows.
3. Don’t leave your room between hours 3-4am. 
4. If you have to leave the cabin at all, bring the pistol by the fireplace with you. 
5. If you feel like you’re being watched, go into the bedroom and place the wooden chair against the door. The feeling should go away.
6. If you hear knocking, do not answer the door. I have a key to the house and I can let myself in.
7. If you see a shadow in the corner of any room, do not go outside. Instead, go to the bathroom and lock the door. It cannot get you in there.

A chill went down my spine. I felt so uneasy after reading that rule, it was so odd- I never would’ve expected my uncle to write something down like that. It had to be fake, right? I put the list of rules on the counter and went over to the room I would be staying in. I was about to walk inside the room when I felt like I was being watched. I ran inside the bedroom and looked around for the chair. 

I placed it against the door and, surprisingly, the feeling went away. I was a little scared, so I tried to distract myself by settling down with my favorite book. I snuggled onto the bed and wrapped myself in the crimson blanket.

After a few hours, I heard something in the distance. It sounded like screaming. I jumped frantically out of my comfortable position and ran out the bedroom door. I slipped into my beat-up white air forces and grabbed onto my phone, which was at 12%. The screaming just got louder and louder. I felt like I was going to puke. The world was spinning. I forced myself to focus and to trace where the sound was originating from. You see, I did this because people have gone missing in these woods, and I thought that I cold prevent a potential murder from happening. The leaves danced around me. The wind sent chills through my skin. I had to find where that sound originated from.

I started darting deeper into the forest. The scream got louder and louder. I was getting closer, yet I saw no evidence of any people there. I started slowing down and re-thinking my decisions, when the screams just stop. My stomach dropped. Suddenly, I heard leaves crunching behind me. I darted towards the cabin, shaking the entire time. My vision grew blurry and I felt like I was going to pass out, but I pushed myself to keep moving. Sticks and thorns tor up my ankles but I didn’t care. I stepped on leaves and almost dripped over an old tree trunk but I still kept running. I rolled over towards the cabin and threw myself inside. Water. I needed water. I went over towards the kitchen. I sipped on my water and sat down on the floor so I could catch my breath. I looked up at the counter and saw the white piece of paper. Panting, I picked it up to continue reading it. 

8. This is the final and most important rule, if you hear a woman screaming, don’t try to find her. She’ll never stop following you.
