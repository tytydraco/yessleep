Mumbai has its fair share of ghost stories, but one urban legend refuses to die. It’s whispered among railway workers, murmured in dimly lit tea stalls near stations, and passed down like a warning—

Never take the last local from Thane to Dombivli at exactly 1:00 AM.

Every year, more than 20 men disappear without a trace from that route. Their headless bodies are sometimes found slumped in train compartments. The railway authorities dismiss it as theft, gang violence, or accidents. But the locals know better.

They say she’s still out there.

Waiting.

The Man Who Didn’t Believe

Ajit Deshmukh had heard the stories but never cared. A 32-year-old marketing executive, he was practical, skeptical, and completely uninterested in superstitions.

One rainy July night, he worked late, missing the usual 11:30 PM train. The only option left? The last local.

As he stepped onto the empty train, he noticed something strange—the air felt thick, heavy. The usual late-night drunkards were nowhere to be seen. The only other passenger was a woman.

She stood near the opposite door.

Dressed in a deep red saree, her hair cascading over one shoulder, her pale skin glowing under the dim train lights. She was breathtaking.

Ajit smirked. He had always been drawn to beautiful women, and something about her made him feel… invited.

He moved closer, clearing his throat. “Akele ho, madam?”

She didn’t turn. Not at first. Instead, she smiled.

A wide, eerie smile.

And then—she moved.

Not like a normal person. Her neck twisted unnaturally, bones cracking, revealing a face that wasn’t human anymore. Her skin peeled away like a discarded mask, exposing something dark and scaly underneath.

Her eyes—two soulless black voids.

Her mouth—splitting open, wider than humanly possible.

Ajit barely had time to scream before her clawed fingers gripped his face. She was unnaturally strong, cold, unrelenting.

With one swift motion, she pulled him close—

And bit his head off in a single gulp.

Blood sprayed across the compartment walls as Muskaanein Jhooti Hai played from Ajit's phone, still in his pocket.

The woman—no, the creature—scaled the train walls like a lizard, disappearing onto the roof as the train thundered toward Dombivli.

The Aftermath

When the train reached its final stop, the railway guards found only Ajit’s headless body, slumped on the seat.

The CCTV footage from the night mysteriously glitched. The cameras recorded an empty compartment. No woman. No attacker.

Just a lonely man sitting there.

Until his head vanished.

The Writer Who Told the Story

A month after the incident, a horror writer fascinated by urban legends wrote a short story about it. The story went viral. People dismissed it as fiction.

But then—

The writer disappeared.

His last known location? Dombivli Railway Station.

His body was never found.

Only his head.

Left behind on a train seat at 1:00 AM.

(Edit: A commuter claimed to have seen a woman in a red saree on the last local just last night. The train was empty when it arrived at the next station. Only his phone was found—still playing "Muskaanein Jhooti Hai.")
