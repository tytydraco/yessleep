multi-generational haunting separated by 186 miles

Hey everyone, so this is happening right now and I just want to know if anyone has dealt with or is currently dealing with a similar situation or even heard of something like what we as a family are going through. 



My mom contacted me 2 days ago looking for help with her dog since I train dogs for a living. Starting around 2 weeks ago their dog Henry started acting strangely when left alone during the day. Not every day either, just seemingly random occurences of violence.  A little background on Henry. He is a Neutered Male 3 year old Australian Shepherd that my parents have owned since he was 10 weeks old. He has lived in their house basically his entire life and has shown no negative behaviors besides being an escape artist until this 'event'. During the day, when my parents go to work, Henry is left by himself with free roam access to the main living spaces. He has weekly play dates and my mom goes home for lunch every day. Henry is not left alone for more than a few hours. As a dog trainer my first thought is seperation anxiety or a lack of meaningful stimulus but i cant help feeling like he is either being directly attacked or being harrassed.

When my parents come home, their house is destroyed, I cant attach  pictures to show the extent of the damage but it is Extensive..... DM me if youd like to see the pictures and the text conversations. So Books ripped off the shelves, glassware smashed, xmas tree toppled, and henry is found cowering in a hiding place. for instance  He blew off a lot of fur while cowering in their bath tub. Henry is also alerting towards the basement door. At the same time as their house getting destroyed things are going missing. Mom told me that on wednesday, after dinner, the power cord for their rice cooker disappeared. the rice cooker was used that night and was not unplugged by either my mom or dad. on that same day the power cord for their xmas decoration also seemingly poofed out of existence.

Here is where it gets really odd. I live In New Jersey while my parents live in Massachusetts, 186 miles away. i have a samsung s22 ultra, it has a built in stilus. I was using it to scroll and put it down to send a text message while sitting on the couch. the stilus disappeared from where i put it down I could not find it after 30ish minutes of looking. it was missing long enough for me  to look into getting a replacement. My wife has a spare pen from her old s21. its a different shape so i  went to see if it would fit in my phone but my missing one was back in my phone. I didnt put it there, my wife didnt either and up to that moment it was gone. the whole reason i was looking for a new one was that when you walk away from your pen the phone will alert you to it being missing and it leaves a small icon showing that your pen isnt docked. Its annoying so i know it was missing. this is just the latest in a long long history of things diapearing and reappearing on their own. The weirdest part is that a lot of the time if the thing doesnt appear exactly where it was left then it shows back up in a shoe. over the years things that i have seen disappear and reappear in shoes include, a ipod, samsung galaxy buds, a ring, money, a tv remote. In the last couple days my dog has been alerting on the bedroom door. crying and sniffing with raised hackles. 

I sent out a group message to my family to see if anyone else is experiencing stuff. Grandma says the xmas lights are being turned off on their own, and my brother in law is experiencing lights being turned off as well. grandma is in Texas. so yea we have 4 different family members in 3 states seprated by the country experiencing if not linked then similar oddities. 

Thoughts???
