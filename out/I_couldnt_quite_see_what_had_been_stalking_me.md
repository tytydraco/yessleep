Do you ever see something out of the corner of your eye?  And when you look directly at it you see there was nothing there.  You tell yourself it was a trick of the light, a weird shadow, or just your mind playing tricks on you.

But now I know something is following me.

I can't really pinpoint when it started.  It might be easier to pinpoint when it started becoming noticeable.  A few months ago I was starting to see these strange shadows more frequently.  It had become harder and harder to just blame it on the usual things.  But I wasn't scared yet.  I've always been a pretty rational person.

So I did the thing that I thought was most rational.  I started looking into the symptoms of schizophrenia.

I didn't have any family members with a history of this illness but I was curious and thought it wouldn't hurt to do a little investigating.  So I sat in my apartment with my laptop on my lap with the tv on in the background.  I looked into the symptoms but really didn't think they applied to me.  I mean, I was only seeing this thing occasionally.  Only visual "hallucinations".  None of the other senses were affected.

That's when I saw a shadowy hand in the very corner of my eye.  I looked over quickly but it was gone.  I stood up to look at the rest of my apartment and found nothing.  Once again, I told myself it was just my mind playing tricks on me.  Everyone experiences this.  Right?

Wrong.  Not like this.

I put the incident with the hand out of my mind.  I'm not spooked easily and I didn't think it was real so why would it bother me.  I went about my days normally.  Went to work, went to the gym, hung out with friends, went home to sleep.  You know.  The normal stuff.  But whenever it was dark and I was alone, I would see that damn shadow just in the corner of my eye.  I could never quite get a good look at it.

It had actually become a little game of mine.  A few times a week I would see that shadow and quickly look all around to try and find whatever the hell it was.  I would jump up and do a complete 360 trying to catch this ghostly apparition.  But no luck.

As if reacting to my increased curiosity, I began seeing this shadow more and more.  It was now a daily occurrence.  Whenever it was dark and I was alone I would just barely catch a glimpse of it.  But no more than a glimpse.  I would have become frustrated if I had actually been taking this seriously.  But it was still a game to me.

Until it wasn't.

One fateful night I was watching tv after a long day of work.  The room had become chilly for some reason so I was wrapped up in a blanket.  And that's when I got a closer of glimpse of this shadow.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw something that was unmistakably humanoid.

I immediately jumped up cause I thought there was someone in my apartment.  I ran to the lights and searched like a madman.  Of course there was nobody to be found.  But I still felt uneasy.  I knew that I saw something.  I just knew it.

The next few weeks were hell.  At first I tried to ignore it.  But it kept taunting me.  It liked the dark so I kept the lights on.  But when I did that I would see it outside my windows.  Just barely as always.  I couldn't get any sleep.  Either I shut the lights off and never be able to sleep due to paranoia or leave them on and never be able to sleep cause I just can't sleep with light.

I began to dread the night.  I knew there was something stalking me.  Or was it worse?  Was I actually going crazy?

And then I got a good glimpse of it.

I had experienced sleep paralysis before, but it had been years since my last episode.  I found myself waking up in the middle of the night, unable to move.  The room was chilly.  Very chilly.  I would have wrapped myself up tighter if I was able to move.  But I had bigger concerns on my mind at the time.  In the corner of my eye, just barely visible, was a woman.  Or something that vaguely looked like a woman.  She was tall and slender.  She was wearing all black and her messy black hair covered her face so I couldn't make out any details.

It probably goes without saying the I was terrified.  I couldn't move and this person was inside my room!  I tried kick, I tried to scream, but nothing.  She began to slowly walk towards me.  And each step she took the room became even colder.  Just when I thought she would fully enter my vision, I woke up fully.  I sat upright, sweat covering my entire body, and immediately ran to the lights.  I searched everywhere in my apartment but found nothing, just as always.

Now up to this point you may still be thinking that this could all be in my head.  I was hoping it was too.  After all, hallucinations during sleep paralysis isn't unheard of.  And for a week, I began to think this was all in my head.  I hadn't seen this figure at all during that time.  I felt relieved that things were finally going back to normal.  But last night, I had the worst encounter with this thing that I had ever experienced.

And yes, this is a thing.  It is definitely not human!

I was walking to my apartment building from my car.  I had just gotten back after spending time with some friends so it was dark out.  I think it was midnight actually and there was nobody else out in the parking lot.  Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it again.  Except this time, when I looked right at it, it didn't disappear.  It was behind another vehicle and it was staring right at me.  Before I could do anything, it took after me in a sprint.

I can assure you that I didn't take any time sprinting away from it either.  I was racing through the lot and past buildings not daring to even look over my shoulder.  I had no idea where to go or where I would be safe so I kept on running.  But of course as my clumsiness would have it I tripped and fell hard.  I was practically crying at this point.  And in the midst of this I cried out,

"Please!  Please!  What do you want!?!?"

And the creature walked up to me.  Slowly.  Very slowly.  It leaned down and whispered,

"About tree fiddy"

And it was at this point that I looked up at the creature and realized that it wasn't actually a ghostly waif dressed all in black but an 80 foot tall plesiosaur from the Mesozoic Era.  And all I could think of was,

"Goddamn it.  Not again."
