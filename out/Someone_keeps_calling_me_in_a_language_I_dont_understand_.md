I don’t even know how to explain this past week and everything that’s happening to me, but I’ll try my best. 

I should begin by saying I am on my way to becoming trilingual, or a polyglot, whichever you call it. English, French, and Spanish, the last being my weakest language as I can mainly only read and listen to it, while only being able to speak it…fine-ish. The first two are a courtesy from my parents—my father being a French immigrant and my mother being from Pennsylvania. I know, a beautifully messy union. At least I didn’t have a boring childhood. My mother is also a pagan, which might explain why I can’t just science my way out of this predicament or try and rationalize it. Whatever is happening isn’t rational.

Someone keeps calling me and speaking in a language I can’t understand. It’s not just a foreign language, those you can at least register as human language. Whatever is being spoken feels…wrong, like some bad fantasy author tried to come up with a non-human language. If I were to try to describe it, I would say it’s a mix of incomprehensible Latin and random mouth sounds mixed with phrases from actual languages, like a dead language from an ancient world gone wrong.
 
It all started last week with an unknown number. Usually I wouldn’t answer a call from a number I didn’t know, but I just started up my freelance photography business, and I have yet to afford a separate phone for business calls, so it’s my personal number for now. I’m not dumb, just…eager for a client. And I know when something is spam, but this hasn’t been spam or bots calling me for whatever reason. Whoever was on the other end of the call sounded human. 

The first instance was last Monday, 4:45 p.m, just outside of my “working hours” I established on my website. I answered anyway. Before I could get a greeting out, the person on the other end started mumbling. 

“Hello?” I tried, straining to understand. The person on the other end paused in their mumbling. I heard shifting on the other end before they spoke up again. I’ll try my best to transcribe what it sounded like. 

“Woah beast do?” There was a slight lisp to the words, like the speaker couldn’t exactly find the right placement for their tongue. They sounded feminine enough to almost sound like an American woman, but their tone was…funny. They repeated themselves again, almost robotically. “Woah beast do?” 

“I’m sorry, I can’t understand you,” I said, upset at the gap in communication I was having with someone who was potentially interested in my work. “Do you know Eng—“ 

They hung up before I could finish. Strange. I sighed and set my phone down on my coffee table, reclining back on my living room couch. I racked my brain for any sort of comprehension I could gain. Throughout highschool and college I took various language classes; elementary Hebrew, intermediate Spanish, a Chinese and Russian course here and there. My dream was always to travel the world, and I thought being prepared with at least the basics of different languages would be helpful in obtaining that goal. Hell, I even bought a Babbel subscription, though it doesn’t get much use due to how busy I am. Whatever the other person was speaking, though, was completely foreign to me. 

I tried the internet, but I couldn’t get the right search results. If someone on this subreddit knows, I’m happy to get some answers. It sounded Latin based, if that helps. I’m still frustrated that I haven’t been able to figure out what was being said, all things considered. 

That night I had my first nightmare in months. I used to get them really bad as a kid, but I was finally put on medication at thirteen and I usually sleep easy. That night was different. 

It started with me in my house, just like a normal night. I was cooking dinner, something that looked like pasta but had that dreamy haze where things look wrong and fuzzy. I was humming. I was content. 

Suddenly, my partner wrapped their arms around me. Their grasp was warm and made my heart flutter. I sunk into their hold, growing comfortable with the new presence. “Are you hungry?” I asked, a laugh slipping past my lips as I felt their long fingers tickle against my neck as they moved my hair away to whisper in my ear.
 
That’s when I remembered I live alone, and haven’t dated in three years. 

“Woah beast do.” 

Their voice almost slipped into a growl as they uttered the phrase I had heard earlier that night. I shuddered, a sense of dread coming over me as the presence behind me turned cold. I tried to move, but their hold was steadfast and I felt almost stuck to my spot. The walls around me began to shift, and to my horror, dozens of eyes started to manifest, staring right at me. The presence behind me continued to whisper that foreign phrase over and over again. It was maddening and I couldn’t make myself wake up, no matter how many tricks I tried. 

I thrashed and thrashed and thrashed, jabbing elbows into the thing behind me and grunting with the effort. Finally, their hold loosened, and I gasped, sitting up in bed. I was awake, alone, safe in my bed. 

The second incident happened on Tuesday at 5:55 a.m. It woke me up out of a dead sleep, and I grasped for my phone blindly, searching to turn off what I thought was my alarm. When I finally looked at my phone, I was confused when I saw another call coming in. I debated answering but the number looked familiar, maybe someone who I forgot to save in my contacts?

I answered. 

“Hello?” I mumbled, rubbing my eyes and sitting up in bed. 

What followed was incomprehensible gibberish. It sounded like Spanish spoken with a southern accent, except every other vowel slipped into a different pronunciation than what Spanish used. I thought I had to be dreaming, but when I checked the time twice, a trick I learned to decipher when I was lucid dreaming, it stayed the same. 

“Comoooo. Wayai.” Is what I thought I heard, but it was hard to tell. A ringing in my ears started, and the person on the other end started to speak faster. Out of panic I hung up, flinging my phone down onto my bed. I buried my head in my hands, hoping for the ringing to stop and the pounding in my head to go away. What was that? What language could that person be speaking? Is it even a language? What did they want from me?

I finally sprung out of bed, rushing to my bathroom to splash water on my face. As I did, I looked in the mirror. My eyes were bloodshot, like I had been crying for hours. Had I been crying? 

Nothing made sense, but I tried to chalk it up to the ungodly hour I was woken up at and the poor night’s sleep I had just gotten. 

I have to go, but if anyone is curious, I could continue this story. I don’t know. My friend told me I would feel better after writing it down, but I don’t feel exactly stellar. Maybe this is futile. I have to go, I’m getting a call, but this time from my friend, who I definitely have saved in my phone. 

EDIT: that wasn’t my friend, because my friend speaks English, and that definitely wasn’t English.
