Hello, my name isn’t important but my story is. What I will describe today will depict what will happen to everyone on this planet. There is no escape, I thought I could but they found me and the worst part is that they let me. I’ll do my best to start at the beginning and then hopefully you will all realize the doom that haunts our world.

I joined them when I was 19 or 20, they were an extremist group but they sort of accepted me which no one else would. I thought I found my group, my tribe, I was very wrong. They manipulated us and hurt us psychologically for the longest time. Finally things didn’t add up so the people I met through them all slowly left one at a time. Finally it was my friend and I, he went pretty deep into it all but I was able to get him out with me.

One of the things they were big on were these people who were descended from giants who are more like gods. It’s strange to describe but you’ll see soon enough what I’m talking about, you just need to understand that they may be giant but they could take you without anyone knowing. They knew people who could make it so you never existed just no one would know or care. Remnants of an ancient world that would soon watch everything fall and take back the world they sought to conquer thousands of years ago.

One day, some friends and I went on a hunting trip deep in the woods of the Midwest in the US. We all had rifles and pistols, we were prepared to be in the woods for a few days and defend ourselves from anything. We weren’t thinking people were coming after us but maybe a bear or a few coyotes but I didn’t tell them, people were after me. It was a late night, we’d been there only two days so we had just caught a large buck and my friend, Bill, was gutting and cleaning while I helped. There was a loud snap in the woods that startled Bill and I, it was not quite 2 am so we didn’t know what it could be. 

Bill grabbed his rifle and I kept my pistol out as we began to slowly move forward towards the disturbance. As we kept walking, we heard nothing and I mean nothing like no bugs, no animals, even the wind was eerily quiet. There was one sound I could hear as we stalked forward, a slow and even breathing from something large. I spun around and I saw it, my eyes went wide in fear as I realized what we were walking into. Bill spun and pointed his rifle at it, he shot it between the eyes but it stayed stock still and just kept breathing like nothing happened. 

I couldn’t believe my eyes, it smelled like they told us like a forest mixed with that scent of a dog. The creature was a giant, it had to be, it stood almost as tall as the trees around us but for some reason it was kneeling down like you would to speak to a child. Its skin was a strange blue as if it was frozen not too long ago, the worst part was that its eyes glowed blue in the darkness. I pointed my pistol at it and told it to leave, they told me I’d be safe, as I spoke I realized Bill was gone.

I looked around, his rifle was gone and his footprints weren’t gone like he was standing there but now nothing is there. Bill was huge like 6’2 with about 200 lbs of muscle, he couldn’t have just disappeared without a noise or anything. As I looked around I saw more glowing blues in the woods, they weren’t as massive as the giant who still only breathed. They were taller than most people but still their silhouettes were huge like they were all bodybuilders to rival Arnold. 

I couldn’t believe my eyes, they promised me we’d be safe. Next thing I knew I was being grabbed but I pointed my pistol at it, near its eyes but I wasn’t really aiming. I was too scared and I felt the calm settle in, the kind that comes on when you’re already dead. Suddenly, two shots rang out which came from my pistol and a rifle; my friend, Zach shot the thing holding me in the arm which made it drop me. 

I ran, I never looked back. I just ran through a spot where the eyes were further apart than normal. I heard Zach follow then I heard nothing, just nothing, I couldn’t stop hyperventilating as I ran. I just kept running till I left the woods and got in my car, I drove home, there was a note on my door. I my breath felt cold, the area felt cold and it was the middle of summer. The note read as such, “Thank you for the sacrifices. We knew you’d comply after what we put you guys through, now keep doing as we asked. See you soon, Snout.”

It was signed, the Bears.
