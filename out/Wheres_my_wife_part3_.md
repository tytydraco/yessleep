Day3 
I shit up and looked down Immediately. I saw blood, my shirt was covered in it. I took my shirt off expecting for there to be a cut. I  was fine.. it was then when I realized my kids weren't in my room. 

I  rushed down the stairs. They weren't there. I rushed all over the house and they were no where to be seen. I  called the cops. They arrived at my house about 7 minutes later. I told them what happened  they didn't believe me. I was taken  in for questioning for hours. My shirt was taken as evidence. They thought I had attacked or killed my kids because of of much blood was on my shirt. They even started to believe I killed my wife too and I was just putting on an act. They didn't find anything . So they couldn't hold me any longer. It was too late though. The wors had gotten out that I  killed my wife and kids. People said I had just gotten lucky but my luck would last for long. All the cops needed to do was get the DNA results back then it would be over for me. 

I got home and sat in my chair in the living room. Thinking to myself what can I do now. I can't even ask for help because everyone thinks I did something to my wife and kids. I went fuck it and went to bed. 

I was in the new pool room. I am really  getting sick of those. There was a lady across the pool kicking her legs in the water. She looked up and shaw me. She told me to come over. She said that she could help me. What other option did I have really. One it turns out to be a trap and I'm died when I've already lost everything else. Two She actually helps me find my wife, kids and we have a happy ending. So I  chose to trust her. I walked over to her and asked "how long have you been here?" She responded "I  have always lived here it's the only place I've known."  I can ask you a question Mrs? "Oh sure!" Okay what's your name? "Oh I don't have one. I don't think anyone here does. I take it that you are a Realm walker" what do you mean a realm walker? "It's what we call the people that aren't from here that I somehow able to come here." So your saying that there is a way out for you?"I have heard there is but no one who has gone looking for it has ever come back except rose"  

Before I  could ask who rose was I was teleported to a room with a mirror and one chiar. I looked in the mirror  and found myself now unable to look away from it. I watched  as tentacles filled the room. I couldn't move. Ther was absolutely nothing I could do. They grabbed my arms and legs. I started  to feel my face burning with every second it grew more intense. I watched my face boil, blister and melt off until it showed me it had eyes. Then boom I was back with the woman again but now she was holding my hand. She said "see I told you that I could help." But how did you? What did you do? What happened?!" It's all okay. You just need to lay down." I layer down on the floor. She sat on my stomach. What are you doing? "What needs to be done" then she started to take her swimsuit off. WHAT I CAN'T I HAVE A WIFE! She began to speak but she suddenly caught fire and burned alive on too of me. She was screaming. Her eyes melted  first then her started to blister and chare . Her skin cracked and a bright orange light broke through. After she stopped screaming she fell on me and turned to dust. I yelled as loud as I  could. Idk why but it was all that I could  do.
