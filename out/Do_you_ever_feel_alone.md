If you ever feel alone, you aren't. You always have a friend even when you don't see them, they see you. They always see you even when you don't want them to.

How do I know? I finally got to see my friend. 

They aren't imaginary far from it. They are as real as you and me. We just can't see them because they don't want to be seen. There are only a few reasons you will see them.

1.You have hit a certain point of loneliness that they appear. They love to see that, it's one of their favorites.
2.You just happen to be special. Like the whole see through the naked eye thing.
3.You are dying.
These are the only ways they will appear to you. 

Why do they matter? They are the things that keep your life flowing. Making sure you stay on track and don't go too far. It is one of their main goals in life.

You know, making sure you are born, make it through life and have your soul ripped apart when you die. If they can't do this, they have failed in the goal.

If they fail it means the ones for other people come and rip apart and eat yours. They then assign a new one. The new ones are normally more mean. They will be more pushy on you doing things that you don't want to do.

I had seen one time a man being pushed off a rooftop by his. They called it suicide but I saw the truth. 

They don't like when you can see them. It causes anger and fear to grow in them. It makes their urges stronger. Sometimes that is what can make them count as failures. It's what happened to mine.

I saw it, the weird abstract humanoid standing just too close but yet too far. I couldn't make out features even though it was in my face. It took a second to realize I was looking at it. I could see the moment it realized I did. Trying to hide from my gaze. 

Nothing it did though worked. It was funny at first. Seeing it try to vanish or run behind stuff. It didn't last long, the others noticed mine's behavior. I don't know if they figured cause I saw it or some other reason.

What I do know is they walked over to mine. It looked to have begged, pleaded maybe. No matter what it did, it didn't stop what happened next.

They all swarmed mine, digging their teeth in. I could see its blood or some substance like it. The screams that came from it were human like, just a little off. The screams didn't stop the others though, actually brought more.

I swear it reached towards me for help maybe. I wouldn't do anything to help though. I didn't know it was. It was new to me and now dead to me. 

It didn't take them long to send me another one. It was bigger and more aggressive. By the time you read this I will be dead. Having my soul getting ravaged by its claws and fangs. I hope you don't see them.

Just know you aren't alone. You have a friend always watching.
