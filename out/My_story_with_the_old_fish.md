I thought that spending a weekend fishing in my hometown might ease my weariness — an idea pulled from a time when I was less tired. I was trying to escape the dry air, the gray sky, and the monotonous work of the big city.

I used to fish fairly often with my father and my grandfather when I was a child; it was always a family tradition. In old photo albums, there are countless pictures of my father fishing with my grandfather, who used to say that he, too, had fished regularly with his own father.

I abandoned this tradition after leaving my rural home, just outside the small town, as I adapted to life in the capital.

My father, unfortunately, passed away early, when I was only fifteen years old. My grandfather did not remain with us for more than a year after his death. I never fished again…

I left the countryside at eighteen. When I found a good job, I asked my mother to move in with me. As an only child, I thought she might feel lonely. She refused. The countryside has a kind of magic that seems to take hold of those who spend too much time there. She told me she could not abandon the house, her small plot of land, her friendly neighbors, the church…

She also passed away a few years later, more precisely, when I was twenty-two. It was a sudden illness, just like what had happened to my father. I used to visit her fairly often, but since her death, I never returned to that small town.

I eventually established myself here. I was always sharp and hardworking, and it did not take long for me to secure a steady job. Today, at forty years old, I work as a branch manager in the construction sector. But I am tired… very tired.

I thought that fishing that weekend would rejuvenate me; what a mistake!

I drove back to my hometown, a seven-hour drive. When I arrived, I immediately noticed the town was different: bigger, more people on the streets, and more shops. The feel of the old town seemed to be gone.

The tranquility ended as soon as I set out in search of the old fishing spot. It was a large lake, surrounded by life on all sides, dense trees, and fish that seemed to multiply endlessly.

The path leading there was different. Before, it had all been thick forest; we wore tall boots, afraid of being bitten by snakes. Tree branches struck our faces and scratched our arms. Now, there was a paved road in its place, and I was able to drive the entire way.

Everything was different. The abundant vegetation and the animals had been replaced by a large pulp mill. I had noticed earlier the heavy traffic of trucks hauling log after log. I think they were eucalyptus.

The great lake had shrunk considerably. Before, its color had been a vivid green, reflecting the surrounding trees; now it had turned gray. I do not think there were any living fish left there.

Even so, I parked the car and walked toward the lake in search of the old fishing spot. It had always been the same place. However, the lake was silted up; not even half of what it once was remained. I would never find that spot again.

All that diversity of trees had been replaced by eucalyptus… endless eucalyptus. All arranged symmetrically, forming vast corridors.

I sat at the edge of the lake, on a sandbank, and watched that devastated landscape through the lens of my memories. It was then that I saw, among the eucalyptus trees, an old man — gaunt, partially bald, toothless — waving at me with a smile.

Out of politeness, I waved back, but avoided holding eye contact; his figure was far too strange. Even so, he remained there, wearing old clothes that had once been white.

I decided to ignore him. I was about to stand up when I heard:  
“Marco, young Marco! Don’t you remember me?”

The voice was rough, aged, worn through, and it came from that man.

At that moment, I thought he might be a distant relative or perhaps a family acquaintance who had recognized me, despite how unlikely that seemed. It had been almost twenty years since I had last set foot there.

I looked back and found that man trying to make his way toward me. He moved with great difficulty, dragging his feet across the ground, at a pace so slow it seemed he would never arrive. I decided to walk toward him.

“Good afternoon, sir. Are you all right? Do you know me?”

“Of course I do. You carried me in your arms, don’t you remember?”

I smiled faintly, imagining it was some kind of joke.

“How so? I carried you in my arms? I think you must be mistaken. My name is Marco, but I don’t think I’m the Marco you know. It must have been a strange coincidence.”

The old man smiled, showing the three teeth he still had, and went on:

“No. I don’t confuse. You are different, yes. But it is you. I knew you twenty-seven years ago. You came here to fish with your family. Here is where I met you.”

“Yes, I used to fish here with my parents. Look at what they did to this place… they destroyed everything. It’s a shame, the lake was so beautiful, full of life.”

“That saddens me. I miss life. Everything died. I don’t stay much longer either. I have no strength to hunt. Before, I didn’t need to. The animals came to me. Now I eat insect. Rat. You can’t live like this.”

“Excuse me? You eat insects and rats? Do you live here?”

“Of course. Where else I stay? I never left.”

“But I’ve never seen any house around here, and my father never told me there was anyone living here.”

“My home was the lake. You took me out of there. You lifted me with care. Much gentleness. I don’t forget that.”

“What? This isn’t right. You’re not well. I’m going to take you back to the city; there you should find someone who can help you.”

As I touched his arm, intending to help him walk toward my car, his gaze fixed on me.  
The old man began to drool, as if he were looking at a feast. That was the last image I remember: the old man drooling and smiling at me. After that, I blacked out.

I woke up at night, with no one in sight, lying on that filthy ground. I got up as quickly as I could and tried to run toward the car, but soon stumbled and fell again. I was exhausted, gasping, starving, and desperately thirsty.

I drove very carefully and slowly back to the house where I was staying. I ate everything there was; I prepared the food in the crudest way possible. I needed to feed myself urgently. Then I slept. I slept for nearly twenty hours — I had never done anything like that before.

When I woke up, it was already time to go back home. Since that day, I have never felt fully rested again.
