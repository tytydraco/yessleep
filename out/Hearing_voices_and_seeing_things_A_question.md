Going to keep this really short and sweet as it’s more a question then a story.

The last 3ish weeks I’ve been working with my dad who is a self employed handyman. At the moment we are working for this older client who has plenty of money on this house he brought in 2023 in Wroxton (Oxfordshire, UK)

My dad has been working on this restoration project by himself since late August 2023 and had finally finished the inside of this house (7 bedroom 5 bathroom). The house was brought by the client for 1.3 million British pounds (about 1.7 million dollars) so it’s a large house and was originally built in the 1600s and doing it by himself took him a while to complete the interior.

But now he’s working on the garden and since I’m currently unemployed myself he’s asked for my help and seeing as it would provide me a steady income I agreed. I am meant to be there until September with the two of us getting the whole place done.

Anyway everything in the house is old and obviously creepy, it’s in its own secluded area just outside the actual village of Wroxton which is old and small in itself and there is literally no service in this place apart from right next to the gate on the front drive.

But all is going well there until a week and a half ago where my dad had to leave me there as he had to go to a pub in Banbury (for the same client maybe 10 minuets away from the house). So naturally I say “yeah okay I’ll stay here and finish laying the patio” and all is fine I’m having a break because we were in the middle of this really hot heatwave and it was 28C (82F) which is very hot doing a outside job in for at the time 4 hours with a fair bit still to do,

So I sit on this single garden chair in the back garden and have a vape (as my generation does) and I happen to look up at the window on the top floor to the left which is now a bathroom (hadn’t been before as there was no tiles to suggest it). I think I see an object in the window kinda like a face peering out and I sit up in the garden chair to get a little closer and better look, as I do so I squint to see as my eyesight isn’t the best but then a pile of slabs (that we are using the for the patio) falls over taking my attention away from the window, without really any breeze to suggest why they had fallen over (for context each slab is refernished stone weighing between 25 and 50kg a slab so for 4 of them to fall over whilst in a pile would of taken a lot of force or strong winds.

So as I look back up at the window whatever I had been looking at before wasn’t there anymore, it was like the object had just moved or gone without even knowing what it was. Since then I haven’t seen anything else in the house or garden but I’ve heard doors closing with just me and my dad there outside. But strangest thing is I’m now hearing this voice.

It’s a low male voice and it’s not really like I’m hearing this voice with my ears it’s like it’s in my head but it’s definitely not mine. And it started by just saying my name and at the time I wasn’t sure if I was hearing things so I kept asking my dad if he was calling me or not.

Eventually I realised I was probably hearing this voice and it was definitely saying my name and I was getting a bit confused and stressed but I also noticed the voice came and went and some days it didn’t come at all. Now the client in his back garden has these noise makers that send out high pitch noises that are ment to deter foxes and cats from the garden however the highest frequency can’t be heard by humans, and whenever I triggered this detection off the voice won’t be heard.

So putting this all behind me I was at work 3 days ago where I fell over this slab which I had sworn I didn’t put there but I fell over it and twisted my ankle. I have since been at home with a twisted ankle and tissue damage nothing too bad just been off work, and now yesterday I heard the voice for the first time in about a week and the first time I heard it at home (Cheltenham, Gloucestershire roughly 52 miles ((83.6KM)) away from the house and an hour and 15 minute drive) and again it kept saying my name and was basically trying to keep me up last night, but instead of it being in my head it was both in my head and around the house, like one minute it came from my parents room opposite mine, the next it was on the ground floor kitchen, the next it had no direction and it was just really weird. Eventually I drifted off to sleep had the scariest dream ever, woke up crying but now I can’t remember it and today I’ve heard the voice only once and it said, ‘people won’t believe you, but I’ll find away for you to show people, so they can believe us’

Just wanted some advice because I’m not sure if I’m going crazy this isn’t the first time in my life I’ve had voices in my head and seen things (I can explain that in a different post if interested). No known person in my family has any disorders to suggest I’m going insane although I don’t know my biological farther so it could be that. But I just think there’s something bad about that house, and I’m more scared I can hear the voice in my home. Finally what do you think he means by ‘I’ll find away for you to show people?’

Thanks for reading!
