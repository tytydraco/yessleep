Finally, I had him where I wanted him. My hands wrapped around the collar of his shirt. His bohemian grin infuriated me to no end. How dared he smile at that moment?  
"You're going to pay for what you've done," I barked, my right letting go of his shirt and curling into a fist raised to his face.   
He laughed, just laughed. His laughter seemed to seep away from my confidence.   
"I did as I promised." He mocked.   
"You son of a b…" my voice and body shook.   
He cut me off. "I made all of your wildest dreams come true."   
And with those words, the man who once introduced himself to me as William Golding took away all of my remaining strength. Before him, I was nothing but a shadow with a needle sticking out of my arm, waiting for a chance encounter with his maker on the side of the road once more.   
The man before me made all of my wildest dreams come true. After our first encounter, my life turned on its head. In no time, I could make a decent living selling my paintings. Before long, I became a world-renowned painter.   
But success isn't as glamorous as it first seems.   
With each success came a tragedy.   
First, they were small and personal, but as my projects became more ambitious, the tragedies grew worse.   
My projects turned more ambitious, forecasting greater disasters.   
"I make your dreams into reality," he sneered.   
Catastrophes I imagined and translated into canvas became international news.   
"You wished to reshape the universe," his words cut me like blades, "I gave you that power."   
Lightning flashed across the night sky, and thunder followed swiftly, turning my blood cold.   
Golding's eyes lit up like funeral pyres, "The Deluge" I've always loved your biblically inspired works!" he mocked, effortlessly breaking out of my ever-weakening grip. Peering into my soul, he asked, "Do you remember what I told you after our first-ever meeting?"   
My inspiration is my recurring nightmares.   
Every god-damned nightmare becomes a painting.   
At this point, I couldn't stop even if I wanted to.   
Every bad dream, a work of art to be swallowed by the masses   
Something to die for.   
Something they die for…  
Every dream -    
Each painting -  
A prophecy of doom.   
Lightning set the skies ablaze once more.  
The Lord of the Flies vanished. Disappearing in a flash, he left me in the middle of a sea of writhing maggots dancing mindlessly around a gallery filled with my works. Socialites and other such vampiric creatures swarmed to witness the dismal monotony of my imagination brought to the surface of this mortal plain.   
A woman approached me, congratulating me on the success of my most recent exhibition.   
"You are like a modern-day Caravaggio, Mr. Oseesson." She quipped.   
"I fancy myself more of a Munch, Miss."   
"Oh, no. The color scheme, the details. He could never compare. You make Edvard Munch look like a Philistine, darling." She rebuffed me.   
I faked a smile and bowed in gratitude, watching her disappear into the crowd of worms again.   
Golding's words rang in my ears, drowning out the thunderstorm outside –  
"The Devil is in the details."
