Not quite sure how to start this but here goes nothing. I’ve been in and out of the psychiatric ward for the past year, everything is so dark nowadays. The medications that the doctor prescribed are only somewhat useful in fighting what he calls the “delusions” I sometimes experience. Only, i know im not delusional. That thing I saw, it was real, I touched it. I fucking felt it.

About 2 years ago I had to travel for a job opportunity. I’m a professional nature photographer and got hired by the state government to take photographs for big bend national park out in Cedar Hill, Texas. Since Texas is so unbelievably large, the trip took about 8 grueling hours from Houston which is where I was living at the time. Within the fourth hour the highway hypnosis was setting in and I felt my eyelids getting heavy. I decided to stop in a town called El Dorado. It was a quaint little town with just about 1500 or so inhabitants. I figured that some small town home cooking and hospitality would get me through the last leg of the drive.

As I drove through some of the main streets I saw a diner called Mayhews. The building was a repurposed rail car covered in chrome, with a sign draped in neon lights that contrasted with the gloomy overcast weather of the day. It was about 6 o’clock so the dinner rush had been in full swing. Even still, since the town was so small, there were only about 4 trucks parked outside. For me that was an indication that the food was at least edible, so I found a spot in the parking lot and shifted into park.

As I opened my door, I was immediately struck with a wave of eerie silence. The lack of noise was a stark contrast to the bustling streets of downtown Houston. What was even more peculiar is that, even the most typical sounds of nature seemed as if they were silenced upon my arrival. No birds tweeting, or crickets chirping, only the sound of the howling wind blowing through the empty streets. As strange as it seemed, my hunger overtook my curiosity and I quickly began to wander up to the diner entrance.

The closer I got to the entrance, the more I could hear the music from inside. Then came the sound of conversations. What a relief, I thought for a moment, as my previous worries melted away. However, that all changed the moment I stepped foot in the door. All conversation abruptly ceased as if they had been sharing a secret that they didnt want me to hear. There was no noise just like out in the parking lot, that same vacant whistling sound from the wind might as well had been blowing through the diner. Nothing except a raggedy hardwood jukebox filled the air with a faint noise. Awkwardly, I made my way to the bar area feeling the locals eyes scanning my every move.

I sat down keeping my eyes forward, I just wanted a bite to eat and I didn't want to cause any trouble. On the bar counter the menu was fixed underneath a clear plastic layer. Damn it, no patty melt, I thought. Eventually after some more browsing I settled on a regular hamburger. In my preoccupation I didn't realize the soft murmurs coming from the other patrons of the restaurant. I caught the attention of the waitress and she came to me begrudgingly. just then I could once again feel eyes watching me. She gave me an eager stare and I pointed to the picture of the burger on the menu.

"Could I get this but with no onions, and-."

Before I finished my sentence, I felt a gentle hand touch my shoulder.

"You ain't from around here ain't you boy, If you were you woulda realized you missed a step back there."

The man who was speaking to me was tall with bright white long hair covered by a green bandana, his bony work hardened finger pointing to a sort of shrine in the back corner illuminated by candles with a white statue of a woman pouring water from a vase. surrounding the statue, were flowers and dollar bills.

"Oh, sorry I must not have seen it, Im just travelling through and I was hungry." I said

"Hell, It aint no big deal stranger. But in this town you gotta honor the shrine or you can't eat. I'm not sure how you city slickers operate but we're very traditional around here." he exclaimed.

The interaction seemed very strange I mean its not like it was a statue of jesus or anything. Perhaps it was some kind of practical joke they play on "city slickers" like me. Yet, the man seemed genuine in his explanation so I obliged. Its not like I was gonna stick around here long anyways. I made my way to the candle lit effigy, pulling out my wallet. I laid one 5 dollar bill on the table and turned around to see the diner slowly come back to life. No longer did I feel the harsh stares burning into the back of my head as I walked back to my seat at the bar.
