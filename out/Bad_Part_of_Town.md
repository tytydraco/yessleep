I drive often into the bad part of town. I don't think it's really that bad. Been doing it often. This time I actually drove into the bad part.

&#x200B;

There is this road. Often I drive on it. "Bad part" of town. Obviously. Drove it during the day. Drove it during the night. It's a big road though. It isn't that obscure.

&#x200B;

Today I drove on it again. Decided to take a random right turn in the boarded up houses section. The boarded up houses aren't that bad. I have taken random turns before as well. I am Impulsive. Plus I can end up finding something neat. It's a great bonus actually.

&#x200B;

Obviously I didn't find something neat. I stumbled upon the scariest sight in my life. Some may end up laughing at this story. I don't care. I felt what I felt. 

&#x200B;

A thin one way road. That's what I saw. With the most beat up cars on both sides. On the fringes were boarded up homes. The homes didn't scare me that much. The cars did.

&#x200B;

One of the cars had its windscreen broken with something big. Maybe a chair. Truth be told I am pretty sure many of the cars had their windscreens broken. The cars in general were dented and fucked up.

&#x200B;

What scared me was the potential. This road... there wasn't much room. These cars were dented. Probably nobody gave a damn... and fuck it, it looked like I was amongst drug addicts who would kill me for a fucking hit. I don't care if that's inappropriate, I had reason to believe that. Plus the cars were probably robbed and getting stripped as well. It was a hellscape. Basically most of the "bad part" isn't bad but this was the bad. I just know. 

&#x200B;

And I was an idiot as well. I thought if I accidentally hit a car, if I drove through, I would have to wait like a good samaritan. I was a dipshit. I was an even greater dipshit though. I forgot to realize that even if it says one way, I could have backed out.

&#x200B;

I headed on in.

&#x200B;

Fucking idiot.

&#x200B;

I was slow. Very slow in driving forwards. The street wasn't that long in general, but it was still too long. Y'all know the drill. It's the basic shit except you could get killed. I remember this particular red car. On the other side I think was a pickup truck. I so gently drove besides that red car. It was jutting out more than all the other fucks. Once I did, had to avoid the fucking pickup. This is America. Red car was on my right. Pickup truck on my left. I drive in the right seat. You can figure it out. When I passed that pickup truck, I just pressed the gas. 

When I was out, I wasn't glad. At the end of the street I took a left turn and tried to find my way out as quickly as possible. Paranoid man. Got on to a big road I knew and got somewhat relaxed. 

Lesson learned. There are actual bad parts. Never going into that one again. Sight is engrained in my mind.
