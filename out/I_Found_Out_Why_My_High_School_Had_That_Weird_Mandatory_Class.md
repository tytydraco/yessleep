Every student at my high school from 1998 to 2006 had to take a class called Cognitive Flexibility and Pattern Recognition. One semester, junior year, no exceptions. We thought it was stupid. Just another graduation requirement.

The teacher was this guy nobody knew. Not in the yearbook from any other year. No first name on the door, just “Mr. S - CFPR.” He’d show us images and we’d have to describe what we saw. Optical illusions. Impossible architecture. He’d play recordings of sounds that made your teeth hurt and ask us to write down what we felt.

There was this one exercise we did every single class. He’d dim the lights and project this pattern on the ceiling - fractals, I think? - and we’d have to stare at it for ten minutes without looking away. Some kids said it gave them migraines. I just felt weird after, like I’d forgotten something important.

The class disappeared after 2006. Just gone from the curriculum. The room got turned into storage.

I didn’t think about it again until last month when I found a thread on a random forum. Someone asking “Did anyone else have to take CFPR in high school?”

Forty-three responses. All different schools. Different states. All the same class. Same exercises. Same mysterious teacher with no first name.

Same years: 1998 to 2006.

Someone linked a FOIA document, partially redacted. A Department of Education pilot program funding for “Preparatory Cognitive Frameworks.” The description was blacked out but the dates matched. The funding came from a DoD subcontractor.

I found my old notebook from that class in my parents’ basement. I started flipping through it.

My handwriting. My notes. But I don’t remember writing most of it.

There are pages of symbols I definitely didn’t draw. Mathematical notations I didn’t learn until college. Sketches of structures that look almost architectural but wrong, like buildings designed for different physics.

On one page, in my seventeen-year-old handwriting: “The threshold is perceptual, not intellectual. Preparation requires neural pathway establishment during developmental plasticity window. See you on the other side.”

I didn’t write that. I couldn’t have. I didn’t talk like that.

I called my friend Jessica who took the class with me. She got quiet when I mentioned it.

“I had the dreams again last night,” she said.

“What dreams?”

“The ones we all had. During that class. Don’t you remember?”

I didn’t. But when she started describing them, something shifted in my head. Like a door opening in a room I forgot existed.

We all had the same dream that semester. Every single one of us. We’d be standing in a field at night, and the sky would be full of lights, but not stars. They’d pulse in patterns. And we’d understand what they meant. In the dream, we understood.

Then we’d wake up and forget.

“It’s happening again,” Jessica said. “The dreams. They started back up last week. But this time I’m not forgetting.”

That night I had the dream.

Standing in a field. Lights in the sky arranged in patterns that hurt to look at but felt like language. Like something I used to know fluently but haven’t practiced.

And this time, when I woke up, I didn’t forget.

I understand now. The class wasn’t teaching us anything. It was installing something. A framework. Neural pathways that would lie dormant until activated.

I googled “Mr. S CFPR teacher” and found one hit. An archived faculty page from a private school, deleted in 2007. His full name was there.

I searched that name.

He doesn’t exist. No birth certificate, no SSN, no records before 1998. Nothing after 2006.

But there are seventeen academic papers published under that name between 1998 and 2006, all in obscure neuroscience journals. All about the same thing: “developmental windows for non-standard information processing frameworks.”

All co-authored with researchers from institutions that no longer exist.

I’m sitting here at 3 AM writing this because I can read the patterns now. They’re everywhere. In the TV shows we grew up with. In the music. In the way certain concepts were introduced in our textbooks.

We were prepared.

Hundreds of thousands of us, maybe millions, all in our thirties and forties now. All with the same installed framework, dormant all these years.

And it’s activating.

My phone just autocorrected a typo to a symbol I don’t recognize but understand. The streetlight outside is flickering in a pattern that means something.

There’s a hum I’ve been hearing for three days that isn’t coming from any direction. It’s coming from inside my perception.

Jessica called me back an hour ago, crying. She said she was watching the news and could see information embedded in the broadcast that wasn’t in the words or images. Layered underneath. Instructions, maybe. Or an invitation.

“We can all see it now, can’t we?” she said. “Everyone from those classes. They’re waking us up.”

I don’t think they’re waking us up.

I think we’re being called.

And the worst part, the part that makes my hands shake as I type this:

I’m not scared.

I should be terrified. But instead, I feel relieved. Like I’ve been waiting my whole adult life for something I couldn’t name, and it’s finally here.

We were always going to be ready.

They made sure of it.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
