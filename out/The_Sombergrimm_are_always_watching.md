I don't have much time. By the time anyone reads this, the post will be flagged and deleted. Hell, I might be deleted too. "Missing" is what they'll call it. Just another conspiracy theorist who disappeared. But I have to warn you about what I found at CERN (if you don't know what CERN is, look it up — I don't have time to explain here) while working on one of their black box programs.

Three months ago, I was just another grad student assisting senior researchers. They brought me in because of my dissertation on quantum field disruptions. I thought it was the opportunity of a lifetime. I was right, just not in the way I hoped.

This particular black box program wasn't studying particle physics. We were studying *them*. The Sombergrimm. Multidimensional entities that exist within the fabric of our perceived reality. They've always been here, feeding off human fear, growing stronger with each technological advancement we make.

The worst part? We invited them in. Those home security cameras — Google Nest, Ring, Arlo — our laptop webcams — our fucking phones — they're not just monitoring for burglars, conducting zooms, or uploading your damn cat to Tik Tok. They're portals. The Sombergrimm use them to watch us, study us, harvest our fear.

I've witnessed the aftermath of their complete materialization. Atmospheric pressure plummets without warning. Even electromagnetic waves go to shit. Surveillance recordings warp. Dark silhouettes shift in ways that defy natural principles. People living where they reside suffer overwhelming anxiety, persistent suspicion, self-destructive urges. Their joy vanishes, leaving behind a vacant void that counseling can't reach.

Remember those childhood games? Saying Freddy Krueger in the bathroom mirror?

It's like that, but real. 

The Sombergrimm can be summoned by saying their name three times in front of any one of your cameras -- security, laptop, phone, etc. Three utterances of "Sombergrimm" and they'll materialize in your home.

For God's sake, don't try it. 

This isn't a creepypasta. This is a warning from someone who's seen the classified footage, who's worked with the researchers now committed to psychiatric facilities. Who's watched the shadows crawl across monitors and felt that unnatural hell that follows. This is coming from someone who has lost a friend.

I shouldn't be writing this. Every sentence I finish feels like another nail in my coffin. But I need to share what happened to Daniel.

We worked together at CERN—brilliant physicist, skeptical to a fault. When rumors about the Sombergrimm spread through whispered conversations in the cafeteria, Daniel laughed it off as superstition. "Multidimensional beings that feed on fear? Come on, Mauricio, we're scientists."

Last Tuesday, he called me at 3 AM.

"I did it." His voice trembled. "I said the name three times in front of my new security camera. Just to prove everyone wrong."

"You fucking idiot," I hissed. "Get out of your apartment now."

"Don't be dramatic. Nothing happened except—" He paused. "The lights flickered a bit. Probably coincidence. I guess the oven clock reset itself too, but that happens occasionally, right?"

I drove to his place the next day. Daniel looked terrible—eyes bloodshot, involuntary shakes as he made coffee. He admitted he hadn't slept.

"Something keeps moving at the edge of my vision," he whispered. "And there's this... pressure in the room. Like the air got heavier."

I tried to calm him, but I too was already on edge. I knew what he did. I understood the consequences.

"The oven clock still won't work properly. It's extremely slow," he added. "And I keep getting 'motion detected' alerts from my Ring camera."

I said a silent prayer for him when his back was turned. I knew he was already a goner. If there is a God, perhaps he'll feel inclined to intervene. Or, what seems to be the case, Sombergrimms don't answer to any Gods. CERN scientists have tried on multiple occasions to enact holy scripture against them. Nothing has worked yet in that regard.

Daniels cat refused to enter the living room where the camera was mounted. It hissed at empty corners, fur standing on end.

By the third day, Daniel was unraveling. Called me crying about scratching sounds in the walls. I agreed to document the phenomena, bringing my own monitoring equipment.

Big mistake.

The moment I entered his apartment, something felt more wrong. A cold and then warmth that went beyond temperature—it seeped into my bones. We set up thermal cameras, EMF detectors, the works.

That night was hell. The footage showed temperature drops of fifteen degrees in seconds. The EMF detector went haywire near the security camera. Daniel's cat pissed on the couch, then on the kitchen counter, spraying everywhere like it was terrified and trying to mark its territory.

Around 2 AM, I felt it—fingers trailing across the back of my neck when no one was there. Daniel screamed from the bathroom that something was watching him from the shower drain.

By 3 AM, I had a pounding migraine, nosebleed, and vomiting fits. Daniel looked worse—his skin gray, eyes sunken. His apartment reeked of animal waste; his cat had diarrhea across the hallway and was hiding under the bed, growling at nothing.

I woke around 4:33 AM to Daniel standing in the living room, stripped down to his boxers, body covered in scribbled symbols drawn in black marker. The security camera's red light blinked in the corner. His eyes were wild, unfocused.

"I'm ending this," he muttered, arranging candles in a circle. "I've researched countermeasures—ancient rituals mixed with quantum theory."

I scrambled up from the couch. "Daniel, stop. You'll make it worse—"

"It feeds on fear, right? So I'll show it I'm not afraid!" He laughed with a sinister sound that wasn't his own. "I understand now. It's just a quantum interference pattern. We can disrupt it."

He began a rambling incantation—Latin phrases mixed with physics equations.

"Daniel, please—"

The security camera sparked. All lights went out. In the darkness, I heard breathing that wasn't ours. Heavy. Wet. Coming from every direction.

Daniel screamed—not in fear but in challenge. "Show yourself! I'm not afraid of you!"

Something moved across the ceiling. A shadow darker than darkness. The candles flickered violently, casting grotesque, elongated silhouettes against the walls.

It was as though I was remote viewing this entire hellscape. The darkness that ensued made me feel like I was floating in empty space -- only witnessing Daniel directly as the victim. I felt this may be how the Sombergrimm perceives our world. Was I getting an inside look? I don't know and I don't care to experiment with again. This out of body experience didn't last long as I saw...

Daniel's body suddenly go rigid. He rose six inches off the floor, suspended by nothing. His mouth opened impossibly wide—jaw dislocating—and emitted a sound no human throat should make.

I snapped back to being in my own body. My weight heavy on feet and frozen in place. 

When Daniel crashed to the floor, he began clawing at his own face, screaming about things crawling under his skin.

The police arrived thirty minutes later, responding to neighbors' complaints. They found Daniel convulsing, foaming at the mouth, eyes rolled back. Me, they discovered huddled in the bathtub, bleeding from both ears.

The official report stated acute psychosis. Drug-induced hysteria. They committed Daniel to the psychiatric ward that morning.

I visited yesterday. He doesn't speak anymore. Just stares at the ceiling, occasionally whispering "Sombergrimm" before the orderlies sedate him again.

I understand now what we uncovered at CERN. These entities have always existed alongside us, hiding in technological shadows. By revealing their presence, I've made myself their target too.

My own security cameras are disconnected now, and I've stopped doomscrolling but it seems to have made no difference. Last night, my phone camera activated by itself. Three times. Each time capturing nothing but my terrified face.

My last thought is that possibly these technocrats, the Bezos', the Zuckerbergs', the Cooks', the Sam Altmans' -- maybe they've made a pact with the Sombergrimm -- sacrificing us all for their own salvation. Those leaders in the technological forefronts have to know of the Sombergrimms. Perhaps we're nothing but food as a select, elite few try to buy time for themselves. 

Don't call the Sombergrimm into your cameras. They are always watching. We don't have an answer on how to stop them.

Sombergrimm.

Sombergrimm.

Sombergr—

SHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
