I live near a patch of woods, not far from a few camping sites. There’s an old basketball court close by—stone floor, two rusty hoops that barely stay up. It’s pretty busted, but it’s still our go-to spot when my friends and I want to hang out. It was a warm day last summer.  
  
We headed out to play some basketball, mess around, and just chill. Everything was normal at first, just us fucking around. Then we heard barking. It wasn’t loud at first, but it felt off. Like, the pitch kept changing. Sometimes it sounded close, sometimes super far away. Almost like it was moving around fast. My friends shrugged it off—probably some dog from one of the campsites nearby. I didn’t say much. Didn’t want to seem weird for being creeped out by a dog. We kept playing.  
  
About ten minutes later, I missed a shot pretty bad, and the ball bounced off deep into the woods. Of course, they made me go grab it since I was the one who messed up. As I walked toward it, something felt off. I couldn’t explain why, just had that tight feeling in my gut. Like I shouldn’t be there. The barking kicked in again—this time louder, like it was really close. Still, I didn’t want to make a big deal, so I kept going. I bent down to pick up the ball, and that’s when it hit me—this sharp pain in my palm out of nowhere. Almost like my body was screaming at me to get out. I grabbed the ball and ran back, hand throbbing like crazy.  
  
I told my friends I was done for the day, that my hand hurt too much to play. They asked what happened, but I just said I didn’t know. They kept playing and I sat off to the side, trying to chill out, hoping the pain would go away. After a while, the barking stopped. Things went quiet.  
  
Then I realized I had to pee, like really bad. Asked if they wanted to go home yet, but they said no, they were still having fun. So I walked behind the court, deeper into the woods where they couldn’t see me, and relieved myself. That’s when things got creepy again. I felt like someone was watching me. Not just nearby—right there, like behind a tree or something. It was quiet, too quiet. Then, as I started walking back, the barking started again. This time it was loud and it honestly felt like it was right behind me. My hand started hurting again, even worse than before.  
  
I ran back and told my friends I had to leave, made up some excuse about needing to help my mom. As soon as I got farther from the woods, everything started to feel normal again. Pain faded, barking stopped. I never really talked about it. Figured no one would believe me or they’d just laugh it off. But something happened that day and it still messes with me a little. I don’t know what it was. My best guess is a skinwalker.
