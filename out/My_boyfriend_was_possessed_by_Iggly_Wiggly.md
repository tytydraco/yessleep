Listen, I get it. Demonic possession? It’s not an ideal quality in a partner. But my friends say I need to stop finding red flags in every guy I meet. And Tony’s not the worst boyfriend I’ve ever had. Dating’s rough in 2023. I’ve heard of worse things than dancehall demons.

It began last Halloween at the abandoned ballroom. Doesn’t any fun night? My brother, Carl, had just successfully bought the derelict property, planning to turn it into a nightclub. So, we decided to celebrate with our closest friends. Tony, Carl, Rosita, Cynthia, and me.

I felt disconcerted. I’m sure it’d once been a spectacular venue. But on that particular Hallow’s Eve, all I saw was a building haunted by asbestos and peeling Bon Jovi posters. I couldn’t decide which horrified me more.

Carl placed a portable disco ball on the floor — it spurted multi-coloured light into the darkened ballroom, but it barely illuminated that foreboding place.

“Look at this!” Tony exclaimed, chuckling and pointing at the wall.

An ancient poster read:

*Halloween Boogie, 1992!*

*Boys and Ghouls, let’s groove!*

“That’s the day on which they shut this place down,” Rosita sombrely pointed out. “All of those people died at the hands of Jerry Tull…”

I’ve changed all names.

“— All right, let’s not be bleak!” My brother pleaded. “We’ve got cider and Bluetooth speakers. That sounds like the makings of a perfect party, right? What are we missing?”

“Iggly Wiggly?” Cynthia suggested, smirking.

She nodded her head at something on the wall. Not another poster. It was something which didn’t seem to belong in that haunted time capsule. A poem scratched into the woodwork of the wall:

*Baby got back?*

*Iggly Wiggly’s favourite snack*

*Summon me UP*

*And I’ll help ya get DOWN*

“What were people smoking in the ‘90s?” Tony snorted, ribbing me.

I smiled weakly, but something about the janky writing unsettled me — given the horror of the brutal massacre that unfolded on Halloween, 1992. I thought of the disturbing tales that I’d heard during my childhood. And, reverberating around the inside of that haunted hall, I was convinced, for a moment, that I actually heard the screams of Jerry Tull’s victims.

I even thought I heard the distant sound of record-scratching. A recognisable snippet from Sir Mix-A-Lot’s ‘Baby Got Back’.

“Wait a minute… Iggly Wiggly… Do you think it could be that thing our cousin told us about? Didn’t Jerry Tull used to write nonsensical gibberish in his notebook at school?” Carl asked me.

I gulped. “I don’t really want to talk about this anymore… You were right, Carl. Let’s just have a fun evening.”

“Guys!” Cynthia gasped, walking down a blackened corridor leading away from the dance floor. “The writing carries on over here.”

She was illuminating a wall with her phone light, and I begrudgingly joined my friends as they walked over to her. Tony seemed particularly enthralled by what she’d found.

“Another fire poem! Did you know about this when you bought the place, Carl?” Tony asked.

Carl shrugged. “Nope. It was cheap, and it seemed like the perfect spot for a nightclub. I think I’ll paint over all of this crap.”

“The Summoning Ritual…” Tony read, laughing. “Am I gonna be the one to say it aloud, guys?”

“Don’t…” I murmured uncertainly. “This is how every horror film—“

Tony ignored me.

“*With a giggle and a ziggle,*

*One, two, three,*

*You’ll jiggle and wriggle,*

*To flee Iggly Wiggly*.”

Tony, upon finishing the poem, abruptly fell silent. Only I seemed to notice, as my friends were busy laughing at the goofy poem. Meanwhile, my boyfriend was stumbling into the shadows, limbs trembling in a disjointed, robotic manner.

“Tony…?” I feebly started.

“What the fuck is a ‘ziggle’, anyway?” Cynthia snorted.

“IT’S WHAT YOU’RE GON’ BE DOING WHEN I SNACK ON YOU, BABY!” Tony hollered from the darkness.

Then my boyfriend emerged, a foot talker than before, and we screamed in unison at the terror before us. His limbs seemed ganglier, and they were horrifyingly floppy.

Wiggly, you might say.

*Iggly* Wiggly.

Before Cynthia could turn to face the source of our horror, Tony had already wrapped his unfathomably large mouth around her head. She screeched in terror, as did we, and Tony started to sway from side to side — gobbling her like a cheerful snake. He giggled with glee, moving and grooving his wiggly, seemingly-boneless body. He was dancing to the rhythm of Cynthia’s piercing screams.

“THAT RUMP WAS THICK, BUT YOU’RE ONLY A LIGHT SNACK, BABY!” Tony yelled at the girl who had disappeared into his stomach. “I’M GONNA NEED SOME MORE CALORIES BEFORE THE NIGHT’S OVER, Y’ALL. LET’S TAKE THIS PARTY BACK TO 1992. YOU READY TO BOOGIE, BABY?”

Something by The Killers had been playing on the Bluetooth speakers, but the song suddenly switched to Jump Around by House of Pain.

“JUMP UP AND GET DOWN, BABY!” Tony giggled, wiggling his boneless limbs in an admittedly ultra-rhythmic manner as he slithered across the floor towards my fleeing friends and me.

I was faster than Rosita, who quickly fell victim to Iggly Wiggly. He engulfed her at such speed. I knew that looking over my shoulder would slow me down, but I couldn’t help it, guys. It was fucking beautiful to watch.

The boy could dance.

His flair was undeniably impeccable as he wiggled his lanky limbs to the beat of ‘Jump Around’. Even Rosita, as she was being digested, couldn’t help but scream in unison with the “JUMP” refrain from House of Pain.

Iggly Wiggly had infected us with The Boogie.

“NOW THAT’S A ZIGGLE, BABY. YOUR BA-DONK-A-DONK WIGGLED EVEN BETTER THAN THAT OF THE LAST SNACK. WHAT ABOUT YOU, CARLY WARLY? YOU GOT BUNS, HON?” Tony cackled.

I turned to my brother, who had tripped over the disco ball in the centre of the floor. He held up a quivering hand

“Please…” He begged Iggly Wiggly.

“PLEASE? YOU’RE SO POLITE, BABY,” Tony cooed, jumping his wiggly body up and down to the song. “YOU GONNA ZIGGLE FOR ME, BABY?”

“TONY, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?” Carl screamed.

“IT’S ALL PART OF THE GROOVE, BABY,” Tony said. “LET ME SWITCH IT UP FOR Y’ALL. IGGLY WIGGLY’S GONNA TEACH YOU HOW TO MOVE, BABY.”

‘Walk Like An Egyptian’ by The Bangles suddenly filled the room, and Carl crawled across the dance floor, shrieking in terror as he attempted to escape Iggly Wiggly.

As he imitated an Egyptian, Tony’s arms wiggled with such effortless, culturally-insensitive grace. And as fearful as I felt for my brother’s life, I’m ashamed to admit that I was aroused. Tony couldn’t dance before he summoned Iggly Wiggly. All of a sudden, my boyfriend had moves. The boy was tearing up the dance floor. I’d never been so attracted to him.

I’ll admit I got the ick when he started devouring my brother. Quite a turn-off. I did vomit on the floor and cry profusely.

“WHY ARE YOU CRYING, BABY?” Tony asked, before burping. “I AIN’T THE BOOGEYMAN. I JUST WANT YOU TO BOOGIE, MAN. I AIN’T GONNA EAT YOU, BABY. YOU GOT BACK, BUT THIS ANACONDA IS FULL. SO WON’T YOU BUST A MOVE WITH ME?”

I shivered, backing away from the thing that used to be my boyfriend.

“NO, BABY, DON’T RUN!” Tony cried. “YOU’RE THE FINAL GIRL. I CAN’T EAT YOU. IT’S IN THE ENTITY RULEBOOK, BABY. AIN’T YOU GONNA DANCE WITH IGGLY WIGGLY? JUST ONE DANCE, AND I’LL SICKLE YOUR ICKLE BOYFRIEND, BABY.”

Defeated and delirious, I danced the night away with my wiggly boyfriend, ignoring his continuous burps from a hearty meal of my dearest friends. And when the clock struck midnight, Iggly Wiggly did indeed sickle my ickle boyfriend back to me.

Tony vomited blood and guts, and his limbs seemed to regain their bones. He shrunk to his normal height, and my non-wiggly boyfriend returned. Confused and traumatised, but very much Tony.

A year later, I know Iggly Wiggly’s still in there. Whenever he hears a pre-‘90s banger, he comes out to play. That’s why I have to placate him with dance parties. It stops him from iggling and wiggling too dangerously.

It saves all of you. I don’t want you to ziggle, after all.

Anyway, Happy Halloween. I’m off to play Just Dance with my possessed boyfriend. I’ll pray that Iggly Wiggly continues to rate my ba-donk-a-donk highly.

It’s not that bad. He isn’t the Boogeyman. He just wants us to boogie, man.
