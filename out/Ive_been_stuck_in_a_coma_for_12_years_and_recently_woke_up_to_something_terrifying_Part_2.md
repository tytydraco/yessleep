"Dear doctors and nurses, we have a code 038. I repeat, we have a code 038. Please lock all doors, windows, turn off the lights and be silent until further notice." The doctor immediately did as told. We were locked inside our room and waited patiently. At 9:36 pm i heard strange noises no human being could make right outside our room.

I stood up from my hospital bed, making sure I didn't make any noise and asked my doctor in a quiet tone if he knew what code 038 means. “Code 038 means that someone or something unnatural has breached the building and-” The conversation was interrupted by a loud knocking. After 1 minute and 28 seconds, the knocking stopped and the “thing” walked away making strange hissing noises.

As the “thing” walked away, I took a small peak to see what it was, and what I saw shocked me. It was a nurse, acting like a zombie but the horrifying thing is, that she had no legs and you could see her insides.“Holy shit, no way that is real.” I almost had to puke even looking at that.

I was dragged inside the room by my wife because she was scared that I would bring that thing back. My wife asked me why I did that and I told her that I was curious. She screamed “Are you crazy?!?!? You could’ve killed us!” That was a bad mistake by her, because a few seconds later we heard the knocking and now even louder hissing.

"No no no no no, there’s multiple of them.” “Multiple of what?” Asked the doctor. “Z-Zombie like creatures. I saw one without legs and you could see her insid-” “That’s enough, Davian. Don’t scare your little sister!” Said my mother. “Ms. Stacey, could you please not interrupt my conversation with Davian? This is very important information.”

Everyone forgot about the knocking and the door burst open revealing 4 violent zombie behaving humans just looking at us. I was scared about these zombies so without any second thought, I immediately grabbed a chair, and threw it at them. That was a bad mistake, because the next second all 4 zombie humans started to attack us. Everyone around me also started to attack the zombies.

The doctor took a scalpel, and aimed it at the head. The zombie died immediately after impact and I killed a zombie with another chair. The other 2 zombies wanted to attack my family so I threw as hard as i could a scissor into 1 of the zombie’s  heart and trust me, I could feel the pain of that zombie. Before the last zombie died it bit my little sister in her right arm and shortly after my wife killed the last zombie by punching it in the head. I was shocked to see that my sister had a noticeable bite. I took another peak to see if there were any more zombies but didn’t see any. “Eliza, are you okay?” said my mother. “Yweah, but my arwm hurts.” My little sister is 8 years old and my family adopted her because they never thought that i would be awake again. “Is it over?” asked the doctor. “I don’t know, we’ll have to see. Let’s use the time to rest a little.”

“Can’t we just call the police for help?” Asked my family. “Sure, i’ll give it a try” said my wife. “\[redacted number\] What’s your emergency?” “Hello, I’m currently in a hospital and we had a zombie outbreak here. Could you please send help asap?” “Zombie outbreak? That’s a funny joke. Please don’t prank call us.” “It’s not a joke or even a prank call, please just send a police officer here. I’m begging you!” “Yeah, yeah so convincing. Goodbye." “Fuck the police, these lazy fuckers don’t do anything.” “Arenia, stop with the swearing.” I said.

It was getting really late, so we decided to throw all the zombie corpses out the window, barricaded the door and closed every window for the night. It was a really quiet night, until something happened. Around 7:30 am, the fire alarm went off. Everyone woke up, and we decided to run to the nearest fire exit. The surprising thing is that we didn’t even see a zombie on our way. As we left the building, we heard multiple different fire trucks rushing to the hospital. There wasn’t any smoke or even fire to be seen, so i thought that it was just a test or an accident.

Almost every firefighter went into the building but 2 of them asked us if we were the only ones in the building. I answered with “I don’t know, we had a horrible incident inside there. We saw these strange people that were acting like zombies and saw a zombie without any legs just crawling across the hallway.” “Zombies? What kind of hospital is this?” “ I have no idea, 4 zombies tried to attack us and we had to kill all of them.” Both firefighters were shocked.

I heard a radio transmit from the rest of the crew, here is what it said: “Unit 2, did you ask the people what happened? “Yes, i think you won’t believe me but they said that zombies attacked them.” “That can’t be true, are you sure they aren’t crazy?” “No, i’m positive. They just told me that they threw the corpses out the window on room 103.” “Alright i’ll go to room 103, the rest of the fire crew are searching for survivo-” “Unit 1, could you please repeat your message? I didn’t hear it.” “Unit 1, do you copy?” “AUGHHHHHH- HELP ME PLEASEEEE THERES THIS THING ATTACKING ME AND BITING ME AND TRYING TO KI- AHHHHH”

“Attention all firefighters, please immediately leave the building, i repeat, please immediately leave the building.” After a few seconds, we saw the fire crew leaving the building and asked us where unit 1 is. We told them what we just heard and they didn’t believe us. I understand them because it sounds so stupid but i tried my best to tell them the truth. They didn’t listen to us and went back inside. The firefighters next to us wanted to go into the hospital but by force i held them back, I told them “Look, whatever you do, they won’t believe us. So just let them go back in there. **They’ll see the consequences of not listening to other people**.”
