There’s a moment in every therapist’s life when a patient says something so haunting that it lingers in the quiet of their office long after the session has ended. That moment, for me, came the day I met Emily.

She walked in at exactly 10:00 a.m., her punctuality almost unnerving. She wore a pale blue dress, simple yet elegant, her blonde hair pulled back in a tight ponytail, and her eyes—a calm, cerulean blue—bore the look of someone completely at ease. No nervous twitches, no subtle discomforts. I should have known then. I should have recognized it, but her composure seemed natural. At first.

“Dr. Gardner?” she asked as she stepped into my office.

“Yes, and you must be Emily. Please, have a seat.”

She smiled faintly, almost politely, before sitting down across from me, crossing her legs in a way that suggested poise, not anxiety. She held her hands in her lap, glancing around my office briefly, as though taking in her surroundings in one smooth sweep. I could tell she was someone who noticed details, small, insignificant things—like the crooked diploma on my wall or the slight ring of coffee that stained the edge of my desk.

“So, Emily,” I began, opening her intake form, “it says here that you’ve been struggling with some issues regarding control?”

She tilted her head slightly, her smile not fading, but somehow deepening.

“Control is a funny thing, Dr. Gardner,” she said, her voice smooth, almost melodic. “We all like to think we have it, don’t we? Over our lives, our choices, our surroundings. But how much of it is real?”

I nodded, trying to feel out the direction she was taking the conversation. “That’s a very insightful observation. Are you saying that you feel like you don’t have control over your life?”

Her smile widened a bit. “No, that’s not quite it. I have plenty of control. In fact, I have more control than most people ever dream of.”

Something about the way she said it made the hair on my arms rise. There was no boastfulness in her tone, just a simple, quiet confidence that unnerved me. I shifted slightly in my chair and decided to probe further.

“Can you explain that a bit more?”

She looked at me, her gaze unwavering. “Have you ever wondered what it would be like to control someone else completely?”

My hand froze over the notepad. There it was, that shift in the air, that subtle prickling that crept along the back of my neck. I felt it before I understood what was happening. I took a slow breath.

“I’m not sure I follow,” I said carefully. “Are you talking about manipulation, or something else?”

Emily laughed softly, the sound light and pleasant, but it didn’t match the darkness of her words. “Manipulation is amateur work. I’m talking about something much deeper, something much more… intimate.”

She uncrossed her legs, leaning forward slightly, her hands resting on her knees. Her smile faded, replaced by an intensity that made my mouth go dry.

“Let me tell you a story, Dr. Gardner,” she began, her voice lowering just a fraction. “I’ve never shared this with anyone, but I think you’ll appreciate it.”

I nodded, my heart beginning to race though I kept my face neutral. Therapists hear disturbing things all the time, but something about the way she spoke—like she was about to confess something unspeakable—set my nerves alight.

“There was a man,” she continued, her eyes locked onto mine, “about six months ago. His name was Paul. He lived in this quaint little house at the edge of town. The kind of place where the neighbors never hear anything, no matter what happens inside.”

Her gaze didn’t waver, and for a moment, I thought I saw something flicker behind her eyes—something dark, twisted, and eager.

“I watched him for weeks,” she said softly, as though recalling a cherished memory. “Followed him on his way to work, observed him at the grocery store, learned his routines. He was so… ordinary. So predictable.”

I swallowed, forcing my voice to remain calm. “What made you choose him?”

Her smile returned, but this time it was colder, sharper. “That’s the thing, Dr. Gardner. I didn’t choose him. He chose me, in a way. His carelessness, his vulnerability, his arrogance… it all led him to me. I was simply there to… help him.”

My mind raced. Was this some kind of delusion? A fantasy she’d constructed to cope with something else? But the way she spoke—it felt too real, too precise.

“What happened to Paul, Emily?”

Her eyes glittered. “I visited him one night. He didn’t expect me, of course. I waited until he was asleep, and then I let myself in. He didn’t even hear me.”

Her voice took on a strange, almost dreamlike quality as she spoke, as though she were reliving the moment in her mind. I sat frozen, the notepad on my lap now forgotten.

“I stood over him for a long time, just watching him sleep. There’s something beautiful about it, you know? Watching someone so unaware, so vulnerable. You can feel their life slipping through your fingers, even before you touch them.”

I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. “And then?”

Her smile widened, a grotesque parody of warmth. “Then I wrapped my hands around his throat. I didn’t squeeze right away—I wanted him to wake up first. I wanted him to see me.”

A cold shiver ran down my spine. “Why did you want him to see you?”

Her eyes darkened. “Because in that moment, I was everything. I was his entire world. His pain, his fear, his life—all of it was mine. He woke up, of course. They always do. His eyes went wide, and he tried to fight, but it was useless. I pressed down, slowly, savoring every second. Feeling his pulse quicken under my fingers, watching the panic set in as he realized there was no escape.”

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. My hands trembled slightly as I gripped the arms of my chair, but I kept my face calm, my voice steady. “And then?”

Emily leaned back in her chair, her posture relaxed, as though we were discussing the weather. “And then I watched the life drain from his eyes. It’s a beautiful thing, Dr. Gardner, watching someone’s last breath. There’s a moment, right before they go, when they’re looking at you, and they know—really know—that it’s over. That they’re nothing, just a speck of dust in the universe, and you’re the one who decided that for them. It’s the purest form of control.”

My mind struggled to process what I was hearing. She was describing a murder, in chilling, precise detail, and she wasn’t hiding it. There was no remorse, no guilt, just a cold, detached pleasure. I took a deep breath, forcing myself to remain professional.

“Emily, these are serious things you’re saying. You’re describing a crime, a murder. Do you understand the implications of that?”

She tilted her head, her smile never wavering. “Of course I do, Dr. Gardner. But that’s the beauty of it. No one ever suspects me. I’m just another face in the crowd, just another person living their life. They don’t know what I’ve done. What I’m capable of.”

I leaned forward slightly, my hands gripping the notepad tighter. “And how many times have you done this?”

Her eyes glinted with a cold amusement. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”

A knot formed in my stomach, tightening with every word she spoke. My mind raced, trying to find a way to get through to her, to understand her motives, but the more she spoke, the clearer it became: she enjoyed it. The power, the control, the fear. It wasn’t about anger or revenge—it was about dominance.

“Emily, what you’re describing… it’s not normal. These feelings of control, of power—they’re dangerous. You need help.”

She chuckled softly. “Help? I don’t need help, Dr. Gardner. I know exactly what I’m doing. And I’m very good at it.”

I forced myself to remain calm. I needed to get more information, needed to understand the depth of her depravity. “How do you choose your victims?”

She leaned back, crossing her legs again. “It’s not about choosing. It’s about finding the right moment. The right person. Sometimes they come to me, other times I seek them out. But when the moment is right, I know.”

Her voice was so calm, so matter-of-fact, that it sent chills down my spine. This wasn’t a woman who was struggling with her actions—this was a woman who reveled in them.

“Do you ever feel guilty?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Her smile faded slightly, and for the first time, I saw a flicker of something else in her eyes—something cold, something dead. “Why would I feel guilty? I’m not doing anything wrong. I’m simply… cleansing the world.”

The room felt colder, the air thick with the weight of her words. My pulse quickened, and for the first time in my career, I felt fear in my own office. Not the fear of a disturbed patient, but the fear of a Not the fear of a disturbed patient, but the fear of a predator, someone who didn’t just enjoy hurting others—they craved it.

I cleared my throat, trying to gather my thoughts. I needed to keep her talking, to figure out just how many people she had hurt, and more importantly, whether anyone else was in danger.

“Emily, when you say ‘cleansing,’ what do you mean by that?” I asked, trying to sound as neutral as possible.

She tilted her head slightly, her eyes narrowing. “People like Paul, they’re dirty. They clutter the world with their stupidity, their carelessness, their weakness. I don’t just kill them for fun, even though it is, Dr. Gardner. I kill them because they deserve it. They need to be erased, like smudges on a window.”

I sat frozen in my chair, unsure of how to respond. It was clear that Emily had no moral compass. Her sense of right and wrong had twisted into something dark and unnatural. But I had to keep her engaged, had to learn more.

“Can you tell me about another time?” I asked carefully, flipping my notepad to a fresh page. I didn’t want to write anything down—my hands were trembling too much to do so anyway—but I needed to keep her talking, needed to buy time to figure out what to do next.

Emily’s eyes lit up as she leaned forward again, as though she were telling me about a favorite hobby. “There was this woman,” she began, her voice almost sing-song. “Her name was Rachel. She worked in a little boutique downtown, always wearing these ridiculous high heels and smiling like the world was her runway. You know the type?”

I nodded slowly, though I had no idea what type of person she was talking about.

“I followed her for a few days, just to make sure she was the one. She was so fake, Dr. Gardner. Every smile she gave her customers, every laugh at their stupid jokes—it was all so hollow, so meaningless. It made me sick.”

Her eyes darkened again, and for a moment, I saw the monster lurking beneath her calm facade.

“One night, I waited for her outside the store. She was closing up late, and there wasn’t anyone else around. When she came out, I followed her to her car. She didn’t even notice me. Can you believe that? So oblivious, so wrapped up in her little world that she didn’t even realize she was being hunted.”

My stomach churned, but I kept my face neutral. “What happened next?”

Emily smiled, a small, satisfied smile that made my skin crawl. “I grabbed her from behind, shoved her into the back seat of her own car. She struggled, of course—they always do—but I had a knife. She froze when she felt the blade against her throat.”

I could feel my heart hammering in my chest, but I forced myself to stay composed. “And then?”

“Then,” Emily continued, her voice soft and almost affectionate, “I told her that if she screamed, I’d slit her throat. She believed me, of course. They always do. So, she didn’t scream. She just whimpered, begging me to let her go, promising she wouldn’t tell anyone. But it wasn’t about her telling anyone, Dr. Gardner. It was about what I wanted.”

She paused for a moment, her gaze distant, as though reliving the memory. “I made her drive. I kept the knife at her side, and I made her drive to this little spot in the woods I’d found a few weeks earlier. Secluded. Perfect.”

My throat tightened as I listened, every word more horrifying than the last. “And when you got there?”

Emily’s smile returned, wider and more sinister. “I tied her to a tree. It wasn’t easy—she fought, of course, once she realized what was happening—but I’m stronger than I look. I gagged her with a piece of cloth, then stood back to admire my work.”

I could barely breathe, my mind racing. I had to call the authorities, but how? How could I get out of here without setting her off?

“She was so pathetic,” Emily continued, her voice low and cold. “Sobbing, shaking, pleading with her eyes. But I didn’t care. I took my time, Dr. Gardner. I wanted to savor it. I wanted her to feel every second of her last moments. So, I started small.”

“Small?” I echoed, my voice barely above a whisper.

She nodded, her smile fading slightly. “Little cuts, here and there. Not deep enough to kill, just enough to make her bleed, to make her panic. She struggled, but she couldn’t get free. I watched her bleed, watched the terror in her eyes as she realized no one was coming to save her.”

I felt bile rise in my throat, but I swallowed it down, forcing myself to stay calm. “And then?”

Emily’s eyes gleamed with a sick satisfaction. “And then I finished it. A single cut, right across her throat. Quick, clean. She bled out in minutes. I watched her die, watched the light leave her eyes. And when it was over, I felt… complete.”

The room was suffocating, the air thick with the weight of her confession. My hands trembled as I gripped the arms of my chair, my mind screaming at me to get out, to run, to call the police. But I couldn’t move. I was trapped in the same room as a monster.

“Emily,” I said slowly, carefully, “what you’re describing… it’s not normal. It’s dangerous. You’re hurting people, taking lives. You need help.”

She laughed softly, the sound chilling in its casualness. “Help? Oh, Dr. Gardner, I don’t need help. I’m not the one who’s broken. The world is broken. I’m just doing my part to fix it.”

I opened my mouth to respond, but the words caught in my throat. I had no idea how to reason with someone like her, someone so far removed from any sense of morality or empathy.

“Why are you telling me this?” I asked, my voice shaky. “Why now?”

Emily’s smile faded, and for the first time since she’d entered my office, her expression turned serious. “Because I trust you, Dr. Gardner. I think you understand me in a way that no one else ever has. And maybe… just maybe, you’re the one I’ve been waiting for.”

My blood ran cold. “Waiting for?”

She leaned forward, her eyes locked onto mine, her voice barely above a whisper. “You’ve been listening to me, really listening. I can see it in your eyes—you’re not disgusted by me. You’re fascinated. You want to understand what makes me tick, what drives me to do the things I do. And that, Dr. Gardner, makes you special.”

I shook my head, my heart pounding in my chest. “I’m not like you, Emily. I don’t—”

“Shh,” she interrupted, her voice soothing. “You don’t have to pretend. I see it in you, the same hunger for control, for power. You hide it well, but it’s there, lurking beneath the surface. That’s why I chose you.”

My breath hitched. “Chose me for what?”

Emily’s smile returned, but this time it was darker, more menacing. “To be my partner. To join me in my work. Imagine the things we could do together, Dr. Gardner. The people we could cleanse. The lives we could control.”

I stared at her, my mind reeling. This wasn’t just a confession—it was an invitation, an offer to step into the darkness with her.

“I can’t,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “I can’t do that.”

Emily’s smile faded, her eyes narrowing. “You will, Dr. Gardner. You just don’t know it yet.”

I felt a chill run down my spine as she stood up, smoothing out her dress. “Our time’s almost up,” she said softly, glancing at the clock. “But don’t worry, Dr. Gardner. We’ll talk again soon.”

She turned and walked to the door, pausing for a moment before glancing back at me. “Think about what I said. You know where to find me when you’re ready.”

And with that, she was gone, leaving me alone in the quiet, suffocating stillness of my office.

For a long time, I sat there, my mind spinning, my heart racing. I should have called the police, should have reported her immediately. But I didn’t.

Because deep down, in the darkest corner of my mind, a part of me couldn’t stop thinking about what she’d said.

And that terrified me more than anything.
