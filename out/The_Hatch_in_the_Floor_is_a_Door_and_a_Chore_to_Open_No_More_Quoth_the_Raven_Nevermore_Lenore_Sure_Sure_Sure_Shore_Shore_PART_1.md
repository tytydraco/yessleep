“Shh! Shut up!” Rex hissed. His eyes were full moons with deep black craters at the centers. “Quit it. Just shut up.”

 

Currently, we were both under the covers. The television had been shut off by our mother, even though I begged her to leave it on.

 

“No, Felix,” Mom had said with admonition. “Blue light is dangerous. Under no circumstances will I allow you two to sleep with that thing on.” It was her daily credo.

 

“Please, Mom!” I said, kneeling on the bed. Rex laid silent beside me. I looked to him for support, but he just shook his head silently. He was right. There was no pleading with our mother.

 

“Go to sleep,” she said. “If you persist I will get your father, and then you’ll really see a storm pick up dust.”

 

I looked once more at Rex and I saw the dissonance in his eyes. On one hand, he was afraid of our mother. On the other, he was afraid of. . . well that other thing. But he was the older one, he was supposed to stand up for us. I decided that he could be as afraid of Mom as he wanted. *I* wasn’t afraid of Mom. Certainly she could be scary, but she was just Mom.

 

“No,” I said with stern defiance and crossed my arms. “I’ll run around all night long and not sleep a wink.”

 

“Young man, you will sleep if you know what’s good for you. You’re a little old to still be sleeping with your brother. Your father allows it—God knows why—but if you keep arguing with me then starting tomorrow you’ll not only have no TV to watch, but no brother to sleep beside either.”

 

With that she left, turning off the light on her way out of the room. We listened together in the dark as her footsteps retreated down the hallway towards our parents’ bedroom.

 

Then, as silence stole over the house like the heavy weight of a lead blanket, we waited for the noises to start.

 

Sometimes it was a thud from downstairs. Sometimes it was the keys of the piano on the second floor hallway playing a discordant melody. Sometimes, like tonight, it was a persistent tapping inside the walls, like rats running across the piping or clawing at the drywall.

 

The sounds came ten minutes after Mom left, a soft clicking from behind the wall by the window closest to my side of the bed. We’d tried numerous times to get our parents to witness these things, but the incidents always subsided when they came for aid. At first, they would wait with us as we assured them that the sounds would begin again soon, but the sounds always waited for them to grow impatient and leave us alone before they continued. It would have made me question my sanity if Rex didn’t hear them with me. Our parents accused us of having too lofty of an imagination, and after this we would get reprimanded whenever we bothered them with the subject.

 

So I covered my head with the comforter and began to pray. We were raised Christians, and back then I still believed that someone was hearing my prayers. I clasped my hands together and begged for the sounds to stop. Rex was with me as well, breathing heavily, but that was all.

 

The tapping in the walls increased in intensity and I raised my voice above my previous, supplicating whisper, to something a little more throaty to try to drown out the sounds.

 

“Felix, quit it! Shut up. Listen!”

 

I went silent, staring into my brother’s wide eyes, his fear emanating out of them like heat from a stove top. Something else was happening in the house.

 

Down the hall, from our parents’ room, came the sound of someone running back and forth, feet stomping loud enough to shake the house. No, two people. There were two people running back and forth, back and forth in the bedroom.

 

“What is it?” I choked out. “Is it Mom and Dad?”

 

“I don’t think so,” Rex said beneath his breath.

 

“Then what? What is that?”

 

“It’s not them.”

 

Whatever was in the walls was still tapping away with lunacy, but I hardly noticed it anymore. It was that stomping. I couldn’t help but imagine Mom and Dad in their pajamas running in circles around each other, no words passing between them, and no familiarity of self in their eyes. The image was so absurd that it could have provoked laughter in the right circumstances, but instead it was dreadful.

 

I shut my eyes tight to black out the thought, but this only gave it more clarity. And then the thought transformed into something even more chilling. Our parents laying in bed, Dad snoozing while Mom read a novel by the light of the bedside table lamp. Both oblivious of the presence of two tall, nondescript figures running tireless circles around their room. And I thought about how if I walked down the hall and opened the door to their bedroom that I’d see those figures, and they’d see me. “Felix, what is it?” Mom would say, looking up from her book. And I’d just scream.

 

“Will it ever stop?” I moaned.

 

“I don’t know,” Rex said.

 

 

 

I awoke to the sound of footsteps, softer than the ones that haunted our night, but still urgent. My eyes shot open and saw Rex more clearly. He was sleeping. The sun was up and found a way through the fabric of the comforter to brighten up our safe space beneath it. The door to Rex’s room opened up and Mom called out for us to wake up.

 

“Quit hiding from the sun, boys. Up. Now.”

  
Rex’s eyes opened slowly for a moment, but his grogginess outweighed his lids and they closed once more.

 

The blanket was ripped off of us and the sudden brightness made me wince.

 

“Get up,” Mom said. “Your father is driving you to school today on his way to work. He’s leaving in twenty minutes. Up.”

 

“Why?” I groaned.

 

“Because today he can, and I deserve a break sometimes.”

 

“Okay,” Rex said, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. “Okay, we’ll be ready.”

 

“Twenty minutes,” Mom said and left us.

 

Rex looked exhausted. The last thing I remembered were my eyes shut, my hands over my ears, and the relentless chaos down the hall. At some point in my anxiety I must have slept.

 

“You didn’t sleep?” I said as Rex struggled to sit up and get dressed.

 

“Not until it stopped,” he said, then he yawned. This made me yawn too. “The sun was up by then.”

 

I looked at the clock beside the bed and saw that it was just past seven. The sun would have come up less than an hour ago.

 

 

 

That day turned out to be a dreary one, despite the auspicious early morning. By eight-thirty a uniform grey coated everything; the sky, the roads, the classroom walls, the very molecules in the air. Mom packed me a tasteless lunch, and I couldn’t help but think that she did this to punish me for my behaviour the night before, because she is typically great at putting meals together.

 

It rained in the afternoon and I found myself falling asleep in Mrs. Barnaby’s class. The steady spatter of the rain hitting the windows worked on my exhaustion like a soft lullaby and I let my eyes close.

 

“Felix, dear,” said Mrs. Barnaby. “This is a place of learning, and one can’t learn while unconscious. If I see those eyes closed again I’m going to have to notify your parents that you are *sleeping* in my class.”

 

My eyes snapped open at the sound of my name and I said, “I wasn’t.” I was confused. “It was off.”

 

“I’m sorry?”

 

“The TV, it was off.”

 

Some snickers from my classmates. I was in class.

 

I paid attention for the remainder of the lecture, feeling inside of myself, knowing there would be teasing from my friends later, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to escape from that grey prison and sleep until the rain stopped and the sun came out the next morning.

 

But my friends left me alone that day, perhaps sensing something troubling in my laconic responses to their chatter.

 

When I got home, my father was watching a sitcom in the living room. He greeted me without really noticing me—his attention fixed on the television—so I climbed the stairs to my bedroom and laid down to rest.

 

Rex came in an hour later looking more tired than I felt all day. I saw him through slit eyes as he stood in my doorway checking in on me. Assuming I was asleep, he gently closed the door and left me there.

 

I was startled awake by a large bang. It was so dark that for a moment I thought I had forgotten to open my eyes. The shades had been drawn to black out the monotone light of the afternoon, but the afternoon had passed, and now I had not even the aid of the moon and stars, or the streetlamps below to see by. Had the house emptied while I slept? Why hadn’t anyone roused me for supper?

 

I instinctively reached over to shake Rex awake, to ask him if he’d heard a loud noise, but there was no one there because I was in my own room that night.

 

Horror clawed at my heart, which beat loud in the silence of the house. I wondered if Rex had been fortunate enough to fall asleep with the TV on. I wanted badly to summon him by calling his name, but he had looked so tired earlier. If he slept, I should let him sleep.

 

And then the bang came again. It was in my room. It came from the closet. My eyes had somewhat adjusted to the darkness and I could see the crack below my bedroom door, marked by the slightly brighter glow of the hallway beyond. I could run to the door and escape, but my body wouldn’t react to the signals from my brain, so I was left me paralyzed in my bed, too afraid to even scream. If I could move, I would wake my parents. I didn’t care if they believed me or not, I would wake them just to feel the comfort of being in someone’s company. And then I would have Dad open the closet to look inside, and even if nothing was in there, even if everything was how it should have been, I would sleep with Rex. Quietly so as not to wake him, and perhaps with the TV on at a low volume so that Mom would not hear it, but loud enough so that I wouldn’t hear the tapping in the walls.

 

While these comforting ideas raced through the high speed track of my brain, the handle of the closet door began to rattle as if someone very weak and frail were trying to muster enough strength to open it. My paralysis broke, and I was nearly on my feet when a shadow covered the light beneath the doorway out.

 

I sat in bed feeling completely defeated. It was a checkmate for me, and so I gave into my fear and let it crawl up my spine like a kudzu vine and restrain me in inextricable knots and loops.

 

But the voice that spoke to me on the other side of the door cut through it like shears.

 

“Felix?”

 

“Rex?”

 

The door creaked slowly open and the silhouetted figure of my brother stood there.

 

“Rex, is that you?”

 

“Yes. I heard a crash and thought you might have fallen out of bed.”

 

And then the closet door began to shake as something pounded on it from the inside.

 

I stood and darted toward my brother. I could see better with the door open, but still he stood there shrouded in shadow, unmoving. The closet door shook with frightful urgency, but as I approached my brother, the source of my fear shifted from that trembling door to what stood in front of me. It looked like my brother, but its eyes were lidless and the pupils stared blindly downward at an awkward angle, seeing nothing. Its slackened skin was blemished and pale and hung loose like processed cheese suspended on chicken wire. And worst of all was the mouth, which hung wide open on a hinge-less jaw. It was as if this thing’s face were devoid of all the muscles meant to hold it in place.

 

I stopped a few feet short of the door, still trying to process what I was looking at when it spoke to me again in my brother’s voice. Its mouth did not move, but its tongue worked up and down when it said, “What is that, Felix? What is that in your closet?”

 

My legs turned elastic and I collapsed. I stared up at the Rex-thing, unable to look away. I heard the closet door squeal open, but still I didn’t look away. In the kitchen, the telephone rang. Still, I didn’t look away.

 

“Felix,” the Rex-thing said. “Oh, Felix, I’m so going to be in trouble now.”

 

The caller was sent to our answering machine, which beeped before the voice of some woman came out of the speaker.

 

“Hello, this is Mrs. Riley from Eleanor Vance High School. I’m calling on behalf of your son Rex. He was not in attendance today. His homeroom teacher, Miss Varkley brought it to my attention late in the day, and it seems that he wasn’t present in any of his classes. I just wanted to make sure that everything is okay, as the school hasn’t heard from any parent or guardian. If he is okay, we would appreciate it if you would call the school as soon as possible to let us know. If he is not okay, then we would *love* it if you would call the school as soon as possible and tell us all the gory details.”

 

There was another beep and then it was over.

 

“Felix, I was just so tired, I couldn’t bear going to class. I walked to a McDonald’s and slept awhile.”

 

The door to my parents’ room blasted open and my father switched on the hallway light. The thing that looked like Rex vanished with the shadows, and the presence of the thing behind me, the thing that escaped from my closet, was suddenly gone as well.

 

My father charged down the hall in his pajamas. I stood up, uncertain of what to do, but I saw through the open doorway of my parents’ bedroom that my mother was up as well. She was moving the bed. The bed had moved, and she was putting it back to where it was. It was the oddest thing.

 

My father rushed past me—he never noticed me—and barged into Rex’s room. The glow of the television washed the colour out of his face.

 

“Hey shithead!” my father bellowed in his stentorian voice. It really echoed through the house, I remember.

 

Rex stirred in his bed and made a little groaning noise.

 

“If you don’t turn that fucking TV off,” my father said, “I’m going to beat your ass, got it?”

 

I ran up behind my father and swatted him on the back. “Leave him alone!” I screamed. “He was sleeping!”

 

My dad turned to me, and his face was once again red with rage. “You too, eh? You bugger, you come home, you don’t say a word, and you go right up to bed. You don’t wake up for dinner. Him, he skips school and sleeps at a fast food joint all day long. You boys watch TV until dawn and you’re groggy all day. You’re privileged, you know? But as of tomorrow that thing is coming out of that bedroom. You can cry and moan all you want, it’s done.”

 

“The TV helps us sleep!” I yelled indignantly. “Can’t you see he was sleeping? It’s when you make us turn it off that we can’t sleep. There’s something wrong with this house!”

 

“There’s nothing wrong with this house. It’s all the TV you watch. It’s poisoning your minds, and you’re imagining things.”

 

“We’re not, Dad,” Rex said. His voice was scratchy, like he had a sore throat. “He’s right, there’s something strange going on. I don’t want to live here anymore.”

 

Dad looked from Rex to me. “You too?”

 

I nodded.

 

“Idiots. The pair of you. It’s past midnight. I want you both asleep in the next ten minutes.” He made to leave, but I stopped him. Mom was standing in the doorway to their room, a small, victorious smile on her face.

 

“Dad, can you look in my closet before you go?”

 

He knelt down to my height and put a hand on my shoulder. “Felix, you’re going to have to grow up one day and be a brave boy. So you can look in your own closet. And if the boogeyman is there to eat you, well, then I guess you’ll just have to get eaten.”

 

He left, and my mother stepped aside to let him into the room. She gave me a baleful glare before closing the door.

 

I went to check on Rex, who was in the process of turning the television off.

 

“Wait,” I said. “Before you do that, I have an idea.”

 

I went back into my room and turned on the light. My closet door was ajar, which was extremely unsettling to me, but despite my father being an asshole, he was right. I had to learn to be brave. So I marched up to the closet and looked inside. It was just an ordinary closet. Shirts and sweaters hung from hangers. Board games were stacked like Jenga blocks on the floor. The top shelf had shoe boxes full of everything but shoes, and from one of these I withdrew a couple pairs of ear-buds and an auxiliary jack splitter. I went to my desk and took my iPod from its charger.

 

I walked back to Rex’s room and turned off the TV.

 

“Here, take these,” I said, handing him a pair of earbuds. I turned the iPod on and used the screen light to find my way around the bed. I got in next to Rex and plugged the splitter into the auxiliary jack.

 

“I have movies on here. Go on, plug your earphones in. Mom and Dad won’t hear it now, and if we stay under the blanket they won’t see the light.”

 

We fell asleep that way almost immediately. It felt like no time had passed when the blanket was ripped off of us. The morning sun came blaring through the East-facing window loud as a blasting horn. The light was strident and painful. Mom stood over us looking like some religious figure by the way the light landed on her pale skin, making it glow, and the backdrop of the sun forming a blazing halo around her head. But there was nothing angelic about her expression.

 

“Oh, real smart,” she said before her admonitions really rang out. It seemed to her that we were lucky we didn’t strangle ourselves in our sleep with those cables in our ears. Just when she thought we were being good boys, obedient boys, boys who showed respect to their parents. Yeah, and the iPod was confiscated and all hopes of good nights ahead were extinguished in the blink of a waking eye.

 

Mom drove us to school that morning, and although not a word was said between the three of us, there was a heavy electrical pulse in the atmosphere of the car that entire ride. Mom’s jaw was clenched tight, moving and working as if there were words in her mouth begging for escape but she would not let them. And Rex sat in the passenger seat looking exhausted and daunted. I didn’t feel too hot myself, but seeing my older brother so worn out really put a filter on my optimism.

 

Rex stood on the sidewalk in front of the school as mom peeled away without a good-day or good-bye.

 

“Hey, Rex?”

 

“C’mon,” he said. “Let’s get you to class.”

 

My elementary school was on the same grounds as the high school. Mom usually dropped us here together because all I had to do was walk past the high school, across the football field, through the fence dividing the institutions and across the elementary school recess yard. It saved her from having to circle the block, and I never minded the walk.

 

“What do you mean get me to class? I can walk myself.”

 

“Then go,” he said. He didn’t just look worn out, he looked hulled out.

 

“What about you?”

 

“What about me?”

 

“Are you not going to class?”

 

He just kind of laughed in a humourless way.

 

“I’m scared too, Rex. I’m tired too.”

 

He looked at me quizzically through the corner of one eye. “Then come along.”

 

He started walking down the street. I hastened to follow.

 

“Where are we going?”

 

“Dunno.”

 

“What do you mean, ‘Dunno’?”

 

“I mean, ‘Dunno’.”

 

I adjusted the straps on my backpack to make it more comfortable on my shoulders. “Are we going to McDonald’s to sleep?”

 

“No.”

 

“Then where?”

 

He stopped walking and turned to me. “Anywhere. Anywhere else, Felix. I’m not going back. So either shut up and come along, or go to class and leave me be. But don’t expect to see me anytime soon. You’re on your own, because I’m out.”

 

“You can’t be out.”

 

“Yes, Felix, I’m tapped out. Donezo. I can’t do it anymore. The tapping in the walls. The banging, the running, the apparitions, the psychological abuse Mom and Dad instill by not believing, and made worse not only by not believing but by punishing; it just compounds the misery and the anxiety and the fear, and I’m out. Off someplace else. I’ll find a job and get myself a cabin perhaps, a place where the walls aren’t insulated so that there could be nothing inside of them, only outside of them. I can stay warm by a stove in the winter, and cool by a breeze in the summer. How does that sound, hey? Like fucking heaven.”

 

“Rex,” I said. “I’ve been thinking about all that, about how Mom and Dad react to what’s happening, or how the things always stop when they come out of their room to yell at us. And, well, I saw something last night that made me curious.”

 

“Yeah? Good for you. You coming or not?”

 

“No. I think you should come with me, not the other way around.”

 

He shook his head and began walking again, to someplace else.

 

“Rex wait! You get home before Mom and Dad and me, so you got a key to the house. If you’re not going back, then can I have it? I might head home a little early today.”

 

He fished in his pocket, all stiff and limp and empty of life, and after rummaging around awhile, he came out with a small key chain. He unlinked a silver key from the loop and tossed it to me. And then he was off again, without a good-day or good-bye.

 

I watched after my brother, trying to decide if I should tell him what I saw or not. If I told him he would come with me. There wasn’t a chance he’d let me go back alone if there was a possibility of danger. But then again, that’s what he was doing now, wasn’t it? Letting me go back alone? Knowing that tonight, like all nights, I’d be in that one place he wished not to be, with those things he wished not to know? But seeing him so defeated is what made up my mind in the end. This was my choice to go back and investigate. He offered me a ride to his someplace else, he wasn’t abandoning me, he was letting me make my own decision. I respected him for that. So I turned on a heel and began my journey home.

 

It was a long walk, but I didn’t have money for the bus. Over all it took me over two and a half hours. The driveway was empty with both of my parents at work. I stood at the end of it and looked up at my house and for the first time I noticed that it didn’t really look like a house at all, but like a crowned king. An unjust king that enjoyed the pain and sorrows of the people that resided within the walls of his kingdom. It grimaced at me. I shook away the absurd thought and it was just a house again. I walked to the door. Mom didn’t set an alarm in the day. It was the suburbs, and we were in a safe neighbourhood. I pulled the silver key from my pocket and unlocked the door.

 

I’d been alone in the house before, on those rare occasions where my mother actually believed me when I told her that I was sick, but this time things felt different. I’d never heard noises in the day, even on those days by myself. I was never scared during the day. But today I was terrified. It was as if the house knew that I knew. It knew that I was coming to unmask its secret. I didn’t know exactly what I thought I knew, but there was something strange about my parents’ bedroom and I intended to find out what it was. How could they never hear the sounds? And why was Mom repositioning the bed last night? Was there something under it?

 

I started up the hall quietly, as if I were trying not to wake someone. Or something. Halfway down the hall and to my left were the stairs that led down to the basement. Nothing of interest there. I kept going and climbed the stairs that led to the second floor landing and dining room area. From there I climbed another set of stairs that led to the third floor hallway and bedrooms.

 

All the doors were closed up there, including the bathroom door. Privacy was a habit that held a firm grip on this household. I walked to my parents’ bedroom door and tried the handle. Locked. How could that be? There were no locks on my door or Rex’s door. And then a memory came to me. One night a few months ago when the piano was jing-jang-jonging downstairs and Rex had been yelling for Mom, but no one came to rescue us, I mustered up my courage and slipped from bed, ran into the hall and gunned it for my parents’ room. The door was locked when I tried the handle then too, but my father answered to my knocking shortly afterwards, and I guess in my distress I didn’t even consider the oddity of that situation. By the time my father had responded to my calls, the piano had stopped its lullaby. This memory now filled me with even more certainty that there was something important in there, and that perhaps my parents were even involved in whatever was happening here.

 

That scared me more than anything else. If it were true, then the two people whose roles in life were to be the key benefactors of their children were actually their key oppressors. Was there such thing as a betrayal so deep?

 

Luckily it was a simple push-button lock, like the ones you’d find on bathroom door handles. There was a small hole in the brass frame that allowed for easy lock-picking. I just needed a paperclip or a nail or something.

 

I went to the closet beside the garage and took a tool bag down from the shelf. This had my father’s micro tools in it. He was extremely tech savvy, and was a hobbyist for reverse engineering old or new technology. Anything from television remotes to desktop computers.

 

Anyway, I grabbed the smallest screwdriver I could find and went back up to the door. I popped the tool in the hole and the locked easily decompressed. I put the screwdriver in my pocket and entered the bedroom.

 

Everything was in order. The bed was made, the two dressers that spanned the far wall were made up of the ordinary things you’d expect to see on dressers (cologne, perfume, jewelry, candles). I walked toward the bed and jumped when I saw movement to my right. But it was just my reflection in my mother’s vanity.

 

Beside the bed I took a long, steadying breath and got down on my knees. I lowered my head and looked beneath it. It was dark under there. There wasn’t much space between the floor and the frame, so I couldn’t see very much. I stood up and grabbed the bed from its frame and dragged it several feet to the right.

 

The first thing I noticed was that there was no dust at all beneath the bed. Vacuuming beneath a bed, from my experience, was not a daily chore. And yet it seemed as if my parents had vacuumed it just yesterday. Maybe they had, who was I to say? But the other thing gave me a reason to believe that perhaps there was no buildup of dust because the bed was moved aside often. This area was kept clean on purpose. I went around to the head of the bed and pulled from that side to shift the bed even more to the right, out from overtop the item of my dreadful interest.

 

I came around the bed again and stood looking down at a hatch. It was a door that looked like one that would belong to a cellar, or an attic (if it were on a ceiling instead of the floor). There was a hasp that looped over a staple, which was then secured with a heavy duty padlock.

 

I thought about the design of the house. Below this bedroom was the family room on the main floor. So technically, unless it led to some hidden crawlspace, it would open up onto a drop into the family room. Was there a matching door like this on the ceiling down there? I didn’t think so, but I would have a look while I went to fetch the bolt cutters in the shed out back. If there was a key I couldn’t waste time searching for it.

 

As I expected there was no matching hatch in the ceiling of the family room. The hatch must then lead to some ambiguous space between the floor and the ceiling. I returned to my parents’ bedroom with the bolt cutters, and with much effort I finally managed to snip the lock. I tossed it aside and lifted the hasp. There was a handle screwed into the wood, which I hesitantly fastened my hand around and after a few moments of careful consideration I lifted the hatch door.

 

I looked down into a well of darkness. A ladder made of wood descended into the midnight depths. If this space was as large as I suspected it to be, there would have been no need for a ladder. I would have been able to simply step down and crawl. But the ladder suggested a long drop, which was impossible.

 

I went back downstairs to the garage and grabbed a flashlight. The house was too quiet, and I was unsettled by it. I had opened the closed lid to the big secret and was met with no resistance. Where were those things that haunted me and Rex in the night? How had my intrusion not woke them from their slumber?

 

Back at the hatch I aimed the flashlight down the well and looked on with incredulity as the beam failed to mark its bottom. I gathered up all my courage and then I stepped onto the third rung of the ladder and grabbed the first. With the flashlight aimed below me, I began my descent.

 

It wasn’t as deep as it appeared to be. I counted forty rungs before my feet touched the ground. About halfway down the atmosphere seemed to change. My ears popped and the colour temperature of the flashlight changed from a nearly incandescent tone, to a much cooler bluish white, somewhere much further up the Kelvin scale.

 

I swept my blue flashlight around the space I was in and laughed out loud. I was in the basement. So there was nothing supernatural about the hatch at all. It must have been a secret passage through the walls of the house that led from the master bedroom to the basement. Maybe the man who had this house built had been a paranoid and had the architect install a secret escape hatch.

 

As I reasoned with myself I remembered that the hatch was in the middle of the floor, not by the wall. And an explanation such as that would not account for the change in atmosphere, or the shift in light scale. And everything seemed a little. . . diffused. Besides, I had never seen any sort of ladder in my basement.

 

I walked around, wondering why it was so dark, and I found that outside the basement windows it was night time. I left the basement and climbed the stairs to the lower hallway of my house. Everything was dark, and my lurid light source made every object it touched look ghastly and wrong. I went to the family room and looked out the big sliding door window. There was not a star in the sky. There was not a light on in any house I looked toward, nor any glowing streetlamps.

 

I climbed the stairs to the second landing and went into the living room there to look out of the bay windows. This gave me a view of the front of the house, and I saw a bluish glow coming from the house across the street. A television was on in there but it looked as if no one was watching it. I walked to the piano and pressed a key. A sharp note rang through the empty air and lingered until I took my hand away.

 

I went up to the third floor and entered the master bedroom. Everything was how I left it, except that there was no hatch. The bed was pushed aside, but the floor was bare.

 

I went to my mother’s vanity and looked at myself in the mirror. The shock I faced there caused me to drop the flashlight. I picked it up but found myself unwilling to face that reflection a second time. That was not me I saw. It wasn’t even human. I took a deep breath and shined the light upon my face.

 

My shape was in a constant state of metamorphosis. I shifted like some undefined thing into dozens of different objects or people, half thoughts that changed mid transformation into the start of some other thing before again switching. I stared at this for a long time and my focus caused it to become steadier. It was an undefined shape, solid and firm, but it wavered every so often as if it were on the brink of changing.

 

Then I heard the front door open downstairs and my shape became a door. Footsteps stomped below me and my shape became a humanoid thing on a march. I thought of Rex and I became Rex, but his appearance was all wrong, not fully formed. Then in my anxiety and distress my thoughts turned to many things and I once again became a shifting, volatile shape, but I noticed that my shape was shifting with each thought I had. The faster I thought, the faster it shifted. I thought about myself and I became me. Or, rather, I became some Hallmark version of me, it was far from a perfect depiction.

 

The steps of the person who entered the house were now on the stairs leading up to the third floor. They crashed down the hall and stopped at the doorway. I flashed the light there, but saw nothing. Or did I? The dust fell around some unseen thing in the doorway, delineating a shape. The shape of a human.

 

Then the steps were carried away and the dust fell again where the shape had been. I followed the footsteps down the hall to my brother’s room. His door swung open by some invisible force. The TV came on and a vertigo overtook me. I swirled, shapeless, through a mad vortex. A sound like whooshing air deafened me, and I tried to scream, but I had no mouth. This happened quickly, and in moments I was returned to the world as I had always known it. I stood beside the hatch in the floor, a dark, forbidding aperture in a brightly lit room. Sunlight once again poured mercilessly from the window, and the flashlight shined its usual incandescent glow. I glanced at the mirror and was relieved to see that familiar face looking back at me. From my brother’s room the TV blared, and so I did not hear my mother come into the room.

 

“You are not old enough to understand, Felix.” My mother stood in the doorway watching me with an alloy of emotions; anger, pity, fear. I felt a strange response to this: joy.

 

“Was it you?” I said. “All along? You tortured us and made us think we imagined it all?”

 

A shrill laughed escaped her lips. “Torture? No, no, honey, we were having fun.” She walked towards me and I took some steps away. “It was a game we liked to play. Didn’t you have fun? Everyone plays this game with their children.”

 

“What fun!” I shouted. “To be frightened each night? Rex has run away because of it.”

 

“Rex is fine. Your father picked him up a few minutes ago. They should be home any minute. You know, you’ll both have to be severely punished for playing hooky today. You thought the school wouldn’t inform us?”

 

She took a few more steps toward me, and I took a few more back. “What is that place down there? Where does it lead to?”

 

“When you come of age you will understand.”

 

“Tell me what that place is right now. I’ll understand.”

 

For a second her face wavered, as if rippled by a soft breeze. But then it was solid again.

 

“It’s where we come from.”

 

Then she was on me. I didn’t have time to react. She moved like lightning, and I was tackled by her weight and we were falling. Falling through the trap door and down into that alternate world below. But as soon as we reached the barrier, I was wracked by vertigo. Shapelessly and deafened by air, I was teleported back to my parents’ bedroom.

 

My mother cursed and sprinted down the hall towards my brother’s room. I stood up, disoriented. The blare of the TV ceased and the house grew still and quiet except for the sound of heavy feet racing back toward me. My mother, all grimaces and contempt, sprinted from the hallway back into the room and lunged at me. I was carried once again through the hole in the floor, but this time we crossed the threshold into that darkened version of the world without resistance.
