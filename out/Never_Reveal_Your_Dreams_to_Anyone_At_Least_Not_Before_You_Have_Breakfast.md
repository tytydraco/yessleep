You’re superstitious…

Maybe not as bad as me, but you must have some superstitious beliefs that are a part of your life. Perhaps, it’s that special sports jersey that you need to wear every time your favorite team plays. Or maybe it’s that pinch of spilled salt that you casually toss over your shoulder every time you cook.

I’m not judging, honestly.

In fact, I’m no one to judge.

I’m the most superstitious person that you could possibly imagine. I’m constantly avoiding walking under ladders, not picking up tails-side-up pennies off the ground, jumping over or side-stepping seemingly harmless cracks on the sidewalks. The list of superstitious beliefs that I hold are embarrassingly long.

The worst part is, I just know that they are irrational. Nothing bad would happen if I didn’t have them. I guess I just follow them as a “just in case” safeguard.

There is one superstition out there though that I know is all too real. This is the one that you have really need to watch out for, or else bad things will happen to you.

**NEVER EVER REVEAL YOUR NIGHTMARES TO ANYONE BEFORE YOU HAVE BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING**

This is one that is 100% real. To be frank with you, I wasn’t always so convinced of this one. Recent unfortunate events have shown me the true nature of this one. I don’t know where this superstition came from or how it works. All I know is that it’s deathly real.

I think it was the antibiotics that I was given that turbo-charged my faith on this one. Exactly a week ago, I was prescribed a drug to help deal with an infection that I got from a staph infection. I never knew a simple scratch at the gym could turn so dangerous.

The first few nights after starting the medication, everything seemed hunky dory. It was the third night though that I had my first actual nightmare. This one was so vivid, like nothing I had ever experienced before in my twenty three years on this earth. The dream started off and I was stuck in heavy morning traffic driving to work. I couldn’t see why all the cars on the road were so backed up. After creeping along for a short period, suddenly all the cars just stopped. I couldn’t move an inch and was just stuck, parked and waiting for what seemed like hours.

Eventually, people started to abandon their cars and walk along the strangely quiet freeway. Everything about the sky seemed so wrong. Like it was about to rain but the sun was shining brightly. Bellowing horns could be heard in the distance.

I made it to work on foot, each step corresponding exactly to what it would look like if I actually made the walk. As soon as I walked in the front doors, every single member of my department was standing in the reception area. They were all incredibly angry with me for some reason. I tried to ask them what was wrong but they just stared at me, some of their expressions transitioning into shock.

That’s when I looked down and saw that I was completely naked.

I know, I know. This is common dream. I guess, for most people, it usually happens at school or something.  I’m telling you though, this one for me felt so real. When I woke up, it felt like I had a new memory, not some fuzzy dream that quickly dissipates after getting up.

My beautiful girlfriend Angela was sitting at the breakfast table. She was breathtaking, even in the mornings without any make up on. Her oversized pajama shirt hung slightly off at her right shoulder. A steaming cup of coffee was in her left hand. She was smiling slightly and looking at a fashion magazine or some kind of brochure.

“Hey babe, did you oversleep?”, she asked me. Normally I was the first one up but seeing her already there was not very common.

“I had the craziest dream. I showed up to work and I was completely naked. It just felt so real”, I told her. I don’t know why I blurted that out to her. I knew I shouldn’t have said anything until I had my cereal at least. Angela sometimes has this effect on me. She’s so quiet, especially in the mornings. I feel like I sometimes have to fill those silences instead of letting them linger.

“Oh that’s funny. I’m sure it’s nothing. Maybe you’re just a little anxious about something”, she offered.

I didn’t know what that meant but I remember looking over and seeing the magazine that she was perusing. It was a brochure for a design school in the city. She must have been looking over the junk mail we received. The school was across state. It was too far from where we lived. I don’t know why she was even looking at it.

I went ahead and made my sugary cereal and had a cup of coffee and then was off to work. To my horror, there was actually heavier than usual traffic on the highway to work that morning. It wasn’t as bad as in my dream, but it was enough to put me on edge.

When I got to work, no one was waiting for me at reception. I mean it would be hard to think of any reason they would all be doing that. In fact, no one cared that I was even late. Everything was perfectly normal and boring.

Until lunch…

At lunch my worst fears came true.

I was standing next to the coffee machine when, without any warning, I felt this sharp pinch near my belly button. Then my trousers loosened up and suddenly they slid right down my legs. My hands were full so I couldn’t immediately catch my plummeting pants. All I could was shift my eyes around to see whether one noticed the disaster.

They did. At least a dozen people saw me with my pants slid completely down my legs. The worst part of all is that, in my rush to get to the office, I had forgotten to put on underwear.

I quickly pulled up my pants to my waist and excused myself to the restroom. Of the people that saw, just a few snickered. It probably wasn’t even that big of a deal. The biggest problem was that my dream had predicted it.

Or did it? I mean the details weren’t exactly the same, but it was close enough. I didn’t know what it all meant, I just knew that I had willed this crazy set of circumstances into existent by talking with my girlfriend Angela. Why the fuck did I have to tell her that story?

The next evening, I had a real nightmare. It wasn’t some anxiety dream where I showed up naked to work. This one scared me so badly that I screamed myself awake.

This dream started out with me standing outside on my back patio. It seemed to be morning because I was holding a cup of coffee. The sun was fixed in the normal spot to the East of the house that I was used to. However, the sky was an angry, fiery reddish orange. It was as if the atmosphere were being boiled by the sun.

Everything about the violent looking sky seemed to be portending some kind of doom. I recalled distinctly thinking about that old adage “Red Skies at Morning, Sailors Take Warning” about an upcoming storm.

I was about to walk inside when I noticed it. The Figure.

It was like a shadow. About the same size as me, standing right in the middle of the living room. I stared at not really understanding what was happening. I was outside, in the bizarre morning light offered by the sun, looking inward to the darkened living room. After squinting my eyes and peering deeper into the room, I realized it wasn’t a shadow but some kind of demon. His black clothing covered everything except its gaunt, sneering face. In one of its hands it held a weapon. A Long staff, at the top of which sat a shrunken head with long barbed wire hair.

I KNEW that thing was about to attack me. In fact, it looked like it was trying to sneak up on me before I noticed its presence. For a split second a horrifying dilemma entered my frightened mind. Do I run towards it and confront the demon or do I sprint away, across the backyard and over to a neighbor? If I ran away, I’d be leaving the demon with Angela, who was likely still in the house. If I ran away, I could call the cops and then regroup.

I knew it was cowardly, but I sprinted away. At this point, despite the strange, I wasn’t sure that I was in a dream. The odd thing, and I mean the really odd thing about this dream was this.

EVERYTHING was normal speed. In fact, if anything it felt slightly sped up. When I ran away, I didn’t get that feeling that things were too slow. Like, normally in dreams where you run, things felt slow, like when you knew you needed to run faster but you just couldn’t pump your muscles to get anywhere fast enough. That was not the case here, I was able to dash out of there so quick that I was over into the next street in record time.

The Demon tried running after me for a bit but I was just too quick. It stopped chasing me after I left my own yard. After I realized I was safe, a sharp pang of guilt hit me. I made it to a neighbors house, hidden in a cul-de-sac at the end of the adjacent street. After I knocked on the door three times, the door opened. Instead of some concerned neighbor, the face that greeted mine was that same sneering Demon.

That’s when I woke up screaming. It took a second, but I realized it was another dream. The clock said it was 10:37AM and Angela wasn’t in bed. That was actually somewhat strange since on weekends Angela always slept in really late.

I found her downstairs on the phone with someone. When I got down she hung up and asked if everything was okay. She thought she heard something upstairs. Her eyes seemed to be a bit red.

So I told her that I had another nightmare. She looked genuinely concerned and then she whispered something strange to herself.

“No, I won’t”, or something like that. I don’t know why she said this but I told her I was thinking about stopping the antibiotics. I only had a few more days anyway left to take them but she told me it probably wasn’t a good idea to prevent it from working fully. She explained how that type of behavior led to “Super Bugs”.

“Well, I have to run to the grocery store to pick up some more food. I’ll need to get some more cereal so you could wait until I get back. OR you could try telling me your nightmare now. I mean, I just can’t believe that it’s possible it would come true. It might prove to you that you don’t have anything to worry about with your nightmares. Plus, Its Saturday and I’m sure you can avoid anything that would cause trouble.”, she offered out of concern.

At first I was refused. Seeing her face though, it looked so sad. I don’t know, I just felt I had to do something but I didn’t know what. So, I agreed and told her what happened. Without having eaten breakfast…

After listening to my nightmare, Angela told me not to worry. She was about to leave and head to the store and to run a few errands and would be gone. If any Demon showed up, I could run away without feeling guilty, she said with a smile.

So she left and I was stuck at home alone. She texted me that she would be a while so I could run out and grab some fast food for breakfast since we basically had nothing to quick to eat. I mean it was silly, I was a grown man and I was waiting for my girlfriend to bring back food. I should just go out and pick up something. Maybe I could even buy some flowers for Angela or something while I was out.

Well, guess what happened when I opened the front to walk out to get my car. Standing there, right on the doorstep was The DEMON.

I mean, he didn’t look like the demon exactly. He was dressed in black coveralls with a red name stitched into the chest. Stephen’s Landscaping. In his hand, he held a large Weed Wacker.

I fucking slammed the door shut and sprinted out the back. This time I didn’t run to a neighbor’s but sprinted over to the neighborhood park that was over fifteen minutes away. I left my cellphone in the house so I couldn’t call anyone. Even I could, what was I going to say? I knew I just likely completely over-reacted to some harmless event. Maybe the whole reason I dreamed that nightmare the previous night was because I remembered something about landscaping going on at the house that we rented.

Maybe it was nothing at all I was a total coward?

I don’t know how much time passed exactly but it was probably an hour and half to two hours. When I got back to the house, I saw the door wide open. It looked like we had been robbed. Several things were missing. Cloths and some things. My work laptop and most of my stuff seemed to be there but it seemed more of the expensive things were gone. I texted Angela what happened.

I called the police and they came out for like five minutes. They said they would take down the report. I gave them a description of the guy for Stephen’s Landscaping and they would check into it.

I texted Angela but she wasn’t responding much. I told I was concerned it wasn’t safe at the house and told it might be best if she slept at her mom’s for tonight. All she said was “OK”.

That evening, with the house locked up tighter than Fort Knox, I stared at the final dose of the antibiotics. Physically I felt fantastic, I’m sure it wouldn’t have hurt if I stopped taking this final dose. Mentally though I was exhausted. I just didn’t know if I had another nightmare left in me. Even if I stopped taking them though, the drugs may have still been in my system. Maybe it didn’t matter, one way or the other???

Time to Man Up, I thought. I swallowed the last pill and chased it down with a full glass of cold water. I got into bed and waited for the inevitable nightmare that was soon to follow.

All right, this is where things get weird and I need your help. I did something after this dream, and I don’t know whether I just made the biggest mistake of my life. Maybe I didn’t though, and I did the right thing???

Here is what happened.

The final dream I had was almost like a false start type of dream. You know, it’s that type of dream where you think you’re getting up out of bed and getting ready but you’re actually still dreaming. Well, in this dream I “woke up” and went to the window. This time the sky seemed normal. It wasn’t red or gloomy or anything that could be interpreted as scary.

I looked over to the bed, and saw that Angela’s side was perfectly made up. Only my side of the bed was messy and shown that I had slept in it. I don’t recall the last time that I actually made up the bed, so seeing that made me a little…anxious maybe.

I went downstairs and I saw Angela. Except for her wet, red eyes, her face looked cold and uncaring. She looked at me as I walked into the kitchen and told me that she was breaking up with me. Her eyes then filled up with tears and she started to walk away. I could not believe this was happening. Angela was the girl of my dreams. She was my everything. I couldn’t process what was happening. I went over to her and pleaded with her. I asked her what was happening.

She started saying things about not being able to talk with me and felt alone. I didn’t quite understand what she was saying but somehow she started to relax. I reminded her of all the good times that we had together and that I promised to do everything in power to make her happy, whatever it was. She smiled softly and said she knew. She agreed not to break up with me and that she loved me. She said she was just scared.

I was so fucking relieved at this point. We spent the rest of the day going out and having fun. We ate tacos at our favorite Mexican restaurant downtown and then went cycling down by the river-walk where we first met. That’s where she apologized for worrying about me and said that she would never break up with me. She wanted to spend the rest of her life with me, and I felt like the happiest guy in the world.

When I actually woke up, for real this time, I felt energized and refreshed. Everything just seemed right with the world. I got out of bed and started to head down to the kitchen. Beautiful sunlight poured in through the windows. I was going to eat my unhealthy sugary cereal to start my morning routing and then call Angela but had a strange thought entered my mind. Maybe I should tell Angela my dream before I eat? After all, this one was a good dream. If I told her, it would mean it would come true.

So I called Angela, who didn’t pick up right away. When she did she sounded so tired. I excitedly told her everything was fine. This time I didn’t have a bad dream but an amazing one. I told her all the details of this one, down to the last tidbit. That’s when she sighed and told me this before hanging up.

“*I think you have it wrong. You don’t reveal nightmares OR good dreams before breakfast. If you reveal good dreams, they won’t ever come true.*”
