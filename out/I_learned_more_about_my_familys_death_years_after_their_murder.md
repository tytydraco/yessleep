I got another package last week

"Someone sent something, unmarked" Daniel said to me, hauling a large box into our apartment.

I stood up so fast my chair fell to the ground. Ever since the first box vanished, I turned the apartment upside down looking for the DVD, but eventually came up empty handed. However, the footage was still burnt into my memory. I ran to the box and ripped it open. Daniel looked scared.

"Jesus, no need to be so vicious about it," Daniel said. I ignored him and finally ripped open the box. There was a small wooden box inside, and I took it out. Daniel looked curious at this point, so he watched as I opened the lid.

As soon as the lid opened, I dropped the box to the ground. Tears were rolling down my face, like they did the last time it came. Daniel was quick to act, immediately hugging me.

"It's alright Hana. It's alright," Daniel said, before seeing the contents of the box.

"Jesus.." Daniel muttered. Scattered among the tiled floor were pictures of me and my family, as well as the DVD, perfectly placed in the box. There were dozens of pictures. Me at Disneyland, me at the beach. Daniel picked one up and flipped it. A grim expression soon overtook his face, and he handed me the picture.

As soon as I took it, I saw that the picture was of me and my family in Incheon. I saw my parents and brothers, with a happy expression on each of their faces. Resisting the urge to cry, I flipped the picture to see a sentence seemingly written in blood.

**The One who Got Away**

I dropped the picture as Daniel inspected the pictures.

"Who the hell sent you these?" Daniel asked.

"I don't know," I said, a lump forming in my throat, "My uncle doesn't have these pictures,"

"We gotta report this Hana," Daniel said. "This is stalking,"

"No" I said firmly. Daniel seemed taken aback. "I want to investigate this on my own"

"But.." Daniel was about to say, but I put a finger in the air before he could finish. 

The next day, I called up a friend, Jack. That night, the three of us sat around his laptop in my apartment. Jack inserted the DVD into the tray in the laptop and pressed play. The same footage was played. 

"So what is this for exactly?" Jack asked. 

"Film project," Daniel said quickly. "Uh...there's issues with the film"

"Uh huh," Jack said slowly. "I thought you two graduated already,"

Daniel looked at me, and I gave a look back in return. Jack continued watching the footage up until the blur appeared, and he quickly paused it. 

"What is that?" Jack asked, peering closely at the laptop screen. 

"We don't know," Daniel said, his arms crossed. "Think you can find out? It's for...the film"  
"Well, I didn't graduate with a computer science degree for nothing," Jack said. After vicious typing, Jack replayed the video, albeit slower. As soon as the blur appeared, Jack quickly paused it, and zoomed in. 

"What the..?" Daniel and Jack said in unison. I stared at the screen. There was a creature staring back at me. Its eyes were unnatural, as if its sclera was completely white, and its teeth were razor sharp. I could see talons protruding from its hand like fingernails, and its feet were webbed. 

"Thats....thats..." I could only sputter. Daniel was looking at the screen in both awestruck and horror. 

"Jesus christ, this can't be real, can it?" Daniel asked.

"Why are you questioning if its real? I thought this was for a film project," Jack asked, making air quotes when he said film project. 

"Yeah..." Daniel and I said in unison. "Thanks for the help...you can go now,"

Jack gave us a weird look as he exited our apartment. Daniel sat down in awe. I was too shocked to say anything. If anything, I was horrified. The thing that killed my family wasn't human at all. The thoughts raced back, and I suddenly leaned over and vomited on the floor. Daniel jumped back as vomit spewed out of my mouth. Shortly after, I fell onto the couch. 

The next day, I emailed my boss and called in sick. I spent most of the day cleaning up the vomit and thinking about the creature in the footage. For some reason, I had a uneasy and scared feeling. It was as if the creature was behind me, ready to pounce on me and finish off my bloodline. I could almost imagine it. It would kill me, then kill my uncle in Korea. I tried to get my mind off the thought of it, but I just couldn't. 

That night, I paced back and forth in the apartment. Daniel oddly wasn't home yet, even though it was 10 at night. There was a sudden knock at my door, and I opened it to see two detectives staring at me.

"You live here?" One detective asked. I nodded. 

"I'm Detective Anders. This is Detective Smith," The detective said. "We're going to need you to come down to the station with us,"

Confused, I followed them to the car, and soon I found myself in a small room, sitting on a metal chair that felt both uncomfortable and cold. Across from me was the Smith detective, who opened a file and slid a picture. 

"You know them?" He asked. I looked at the picture and saw Jack and Daniel staring back at me.

"Yes...what is this about?" I asked. Smith sighed and took back the picture.

"We found their bodies down at the park," Smith said. "They appeared to have been stabbed so much their heads were nearly separated from their bodies, and there was claw marks on their chest,"

The tears came rolling down my cheek uncontrollably.

"No.." I said. "No no no...this can't be real...tell me this isn't real.."  
Smith sighed and put the picture back into the file. "I'm sorry"  
"TELL ME THIS ISNT REAL!" I slammed the table. Smith looked taken aback. 

"Maam...I'm sorry" Smith said. "The reason we called you in was because you shared a residence with one of the victims. We just wanted to ask some questions"

I was sobbing at this point. Smith walked out and came back a couple of minutes later with a box of tissues. Soon, the crying stopped, but I felt as numb as ever. The time seemed to go by in seconds, and soon I was free to leave. I walked back into the apartment, which seemed empty now. I imagined Daniel coming home, his arms filled with groceries. The tears spilled out again and I cried for what seemed like hours. 

There was a sudden flicker, and the lights went out. I fumbled into the kitchen and grabbed the flashlight in the drawer, and turned it on. I suddenly screamed. Standing in front of me was the creature from the footage. It smiled and slowly lumbered forward. I grabbed the kitchen knife off the counter and pointed it at the creature.

"Stay back! STAY BACK!" I screamed. The creature swiped the knife away, and it clattered to the ground. It began caressing my face with its talons, and fresh blood streaks were made on my face.

"**My beautiful"** It grinned. "**you haven't aged after eighteen years"**  
I whimpered as it touched my face.

"**You're as beautiful as ever"** The creature said. "**Oh to have you as my own"**

I closed my eyes as a stinging pain took over my face. There was a sudden shriek, followed by silence. I opened my eyes to see the creature gone, but the streaks were still there. Dawn had just broken, and the sun was rising. I slowly bandaged myself and shambled towards my couch. There was a knock, and I shambled like a zombie to the door to open it. Standing in front of me was my neighbor.

"Are you ok?" The neighbor asked. "I heard screaming," 

"Yeah.." I said groggily. "Just watching a movie,"

The neighbor nodded and left. I sat down on my couch again. The tears were coming back now, and for the rest of the day I sobbed for hours.

I'm still a mess right now. The funeral for Daniel and Jack is tomorrow, so I have to get ready. However, the creature still haunts me in my dreams. I now dream that its talons have slashed at my throat. The creature, in every one of my dreams now, grins with satisfaction as I fall to the ground. It's inescapable now, and somehow, I can't shake the feeling that this is real now.
