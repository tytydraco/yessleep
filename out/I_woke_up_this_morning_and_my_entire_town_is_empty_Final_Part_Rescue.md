(Content Warning: Self Harm)

It’s been two days since I last updated you all. I haven’t gotten any phone calls from Nancy or anyone else. We lost James yesterday, we were in Walmart, getting supplies when the corrupted came. We tried to fight them but it was no use, they took James. We can only assume that James is dead. The corrupted most likely did to him what they did to Marcus. 

Over the past two days, I found out more about the group. Apparently they have been trapped in this hellhole for two weeks, almost three. Thomas has lost hope that we’ll ever get out. But Andrea was really persistent that we would be okay. She’s a couple years older than me but seems wise beyond her years. If I’m being honest, she’s the only one holding the group together

It’s been a few hour since I last wrote in my notes. Thomas had some sort of mental breakdown and tried to leave town. We told him that it was useless but it didn’t matter, he kept trying. After an hour, he gave up.

I was taking a sip from my water bottle and in my peripheral vision, I could see Thomas raise his handgun to his mouth. “No!” Jane shouted, but it was too late. Thomas had already pulled the trigger. 

•••

It’s been five hours, a lot has happened in that time. When Thomas pulled the trigger, that gunshot attracted the corrupted, and I don’t mean a couple of them, I mean all of them. Hundreds of corrupted were sprinting over the hills toward us. All we could do was open fire.

The corrupted didn’t die from normal gunshots to the head. You couldn’t shoot them once and kill them. You had to shoot them twice, otherwise whatever was controlling them would heal them again. 

As the corrupted came over the hill, I panicked. I could feel the goosebumps again, just like I did when I had my first encounter with the old lady. There was this perpetual fear that I would be taken to the landfill next and would be eaten by what lives there. I continued shooting at the corrupted by it felt like no use. Andrea never lost hope though, she just kept shooting, even when the rest of us stopped. 

As the corrupted got closer, I thought I heard a noise, a familiar noise. A noise that everyone has heard in their life. It sounded like a helicopter. As if our prayers had been answered, two black hawk helicopters with the letters “CST” written on them seemingly appeared out of nowhere, armed men and women started mowing down the corrupted, killing them. But it didn’t matter, the corrupted were not letting up and they were only getting closer. 

Three fighter jets with the same letters written on them flew over head. They were heading in the direction of the landfill. One last helicopter came and landed right by us. We each started boarding the helicopter. First Jane, then Frank, then me. As Andrea was starting to get into the helicopter, the corrupted got her. I could hear explosions in the distance and assumed the corrupted became desperate because when I looked down after the helicopter began flying away, I could see Andrea was being torn apart. 

The fight lasted ten minutes. The soldiers sent missiles at the landfill, killing whatever it was that lived there. When they did kill it, the world around us started to look very different. In actuality, we weren’t in my town at all, but instead we were in the middle of nowhere, just a big field of crops.

We were flown to the temporary headquarters for the CST where we were given food, water and hot showers. After that we were given a briefing. As it turns out, I wasn’t missing for a week, I was only missing for six hours. The “anomaly” as the Lieutenant called it, shifted our process of time, speeding things up. 

For those of you wondering, no they did not tell us what the anomaly was. I never got to see the anomaly up close. All I know is that they took it back to base for study. CST stands for “Control, Study, Terminate.” My guess is that they are some new kind of government operated force that deals with things like this. Andrea and Thomas’ bodies were recovered, Marcus was never found and from what I can guess, his remains are in the anomaly’s digestive tract.

After a few hours, I got to see my parents and my girlfriend Nancy. I had never been more thankful for anything in my life. As I’m typing this, I’m in the car with my parents and Nancy resting her head on my shoulder. 

I want to personally thank you all for reading more entries, I think a part of it kept me sane. And thank you to everyone who checked in to make sure that I was okay, I appreciate it. 

Before I go, I wanted to ask if anyone has heard of CST before? I’ve never heard of them on the news or anything like that, but I’m sure that it’s probably some secret government program. 

Again, thank you all for your support. Time to start seeing a therapist.
