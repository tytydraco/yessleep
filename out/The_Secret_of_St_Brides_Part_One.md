I never thought I’d ever post on an occult forum like this one. No offense obviously, but until recent events, I didn’t think much about the supernatural or magic or ghosts or whatever.

I grew up hearing the stories just like everyone else in Ireland, but as far as I was concerned that was all they were, stories, fairy tales… You know, the type of things you tell children to get them off to sleep smiling.

But something has been happening. It’s so strange and the only way I can wrap my head around it is to say it’s supernatural or magic …or something, some sort of explanation. Either that or I’m going mad.

So, I’ve decided to share what’s been happening to me on this forum in the hopes that someone might recognise what’s going on and help me to stop this from getting any worse.

It all began about a month ago, my uncle Dara had died and my whole family were down at his house sorting through his things. I had always liked uncle Dara, he was a quiet man who liked to collect tech and gadgets, we used to chat about the video games he liked, which to me were really abstract and retro.

I remember him as tall, with wispy brown hair and he wore thick rimmed glasses as he hunched over screens at his office job, jambing figures into spreadsheets for some boring beige corporation. Dara lived alone in a tall, narrow terraced house in Dublin. He kept everything fairly neat, so our task of sorting through his belongings did not take too long.

When we were wrapping things up and preparing for the long drive home, I spotted something in the corner of his living room; a chunky box of discoloured plastic with a face of dust covered blackness; Dara’s ancient Commodore 64. This was one of the earliest PCs and also one of my uncle’s most prized possessions. When it caught my eye it was like time had stopped and I had been transported back to the late 90s and to our frequent visits with mammy to see her brother Dara.

We would leave the damp, boggy, wide open landscape of rural Ireland behind for the damp tarmacadam, concrete and narrowness of the island’s capital city. My brother and I would stare in amazement as our uncle showed us the many computers and gadgets he’d collected. There were clunky 1980’s “mobile phones” that weighed a tonne, ancient Nintendo consoles that seemed like mysterious artefacts and the huge Commodore 64. While my brother only showed interest in the games and consoles, I took a shine to this big old computer. This was not like the computer in our house, despite our computer sporting a comparably fat boxy shape, I could tell that the Commodore 64 was older, its design featured more sharp angles and straight lines and when it was switched on it made such aggressive whirring noises I was always afraid it might explode. I liked how alien, yet familiar it felt. But more than anything, I think I liked it best because I could tell it was my uncle’s favourite too.

When dad patted me on the shoulder I was dragged back into the present and realised I must have been daydreaming for ages.

“Ready to go?”

I shifted the weight of a bag filled with old Nintendo cartridges on my shoulder and responded; “Almost, is it okay if I take one more thing though?”

He looked at me inquiringly and shrugged; “Sure, what?” He followed my gaze across the room to the dusty old computer and rolled his eyes in response.

“Grand, yeah, but I’ll leave it to you to dismantle that thing, I haven’t a clue with any of that technology stuff.”

I nodded with a grin, it’s true, my father had a stubborn allergy to anything technological that was borderline funny… Funny, until you were the one he called into the room to figure out what was going on with the TV or the laptop or the phone or the radio or whatever other unfortunate gadget he was trying to force into submission.

I was still grinning as I lugged the heavy computer and a box labelled “FLOPPY DISCS” to the car and slotted them into a safe corner for transit. I remembered that these “floppy discs” were what Dara used with the ancient computer and that some of them had games on them, so I grabbed them as an afterthought.

When we got home that night none of us bothered unpacking the car, we all crawled into our beds and slept, mindful of the new week of work and school that was waiting to unfold the following day. In fact, we didn’t empty the car until the following Saturday, mam and dad had drove around for almost an entire week with a car boot full of uncle Dara’s trinkets and keepsakes.

That Saturday, after everything had been taken from the car and stored in stacked boxes in the attic or placed around the house where we could admire of make use of it, I finally got around to setting up the Commodore. It did not take long and before I knew it I was pressing the power button and booting her up.

The computer seemed to creak and moan as it whirred its way back to life. First the screen filled with static like a TV which wasn’t tuned to the correct channel. It took a criminally long amount of time for it to boot up. But then, finally it flashed a bright blue screen of life.

From then on I spent several evenings pulling random floppy discs from the box and sliding the flimsy plastic squares into the disc drive. Most of the softwares weren't too interesting, like Omniwriter; a very early word processing software like Microsoft Word… only really basic or Multiplan; a rudimentary version of Excel. *No fun there.* But then I hit a gold mine; the games.

Uncle Dara actually had quite a few and some were actually really good! Like Ghostbusters with its really simple but really cool graphics and that beeping, blooping version of the movie’s theme tune, or Mayhem in Monster Land; a platformer that looks like it was inspired by the Super Mario games.

These and others like them were definitely fun, but after a few weeks and way too many hours playing the same games over and over again, I was bored. I was now reaching for the last few floppy discs sitting in the back corner of the dusty box.

The next disc that I pulled out of obscurity had a scuffed sticker on it with a name written in pen. It said “The Secret of St. Bride's” in a swooping cursive. This piqued my interest. I pulled my phone out and began to google the title, just as I had done with all the other retro games and software discs.

The first thing I found about “The Secret of St. Brides” was a review on an archival website for some 1980s gaming magazine. This obscure, Irish sounding title was actually a video game. Among the few details I had gleaned in this initial casual search I spotted the publisher’s name; ‘Saint Brides School (Ireland)’.

Now this really was weird, video game developers in Ireland? In the 1980s? Surely not. This was **definitely** a **very** cool find… Or so I thought.

Today, looking back, I wish I’d never taken that old computer home. Because, if I am right, then what I did next was the inciting event that opened a pandora’s box of craziness that I really hope can be closed.

The game is just a text adventure, there are no music or graphics. Gameplay features silence and a screen filled with words that players respond to by typing an occasional response.

The opening screen said the following:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Essay*

*THE SECRET OF ST. BRIDE'S*

*A Schoolgirl Adventure*

*by*

*Priscilla Langbridge*

*Copyright St. Bride's School 1985*

*No Cribbing!*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

By the way, “cribbing” means cheating or stealing in some old timey slang… I had to look this up too.

Because of what has been happening since I started playing the game this will be the only screenshot I will share. I will also give no direct quotes, any “quotes” I provide will have the wording changed around to prevent any trouble spreading by me sharing what happened to me. I don’t know if this is like a contagion, but I do not want to take that risk.

The story of the game unfolds like this:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*You have arrived in the early morning at your destination; a holiday centre where people can experience life at an old fashioned boarding school for girls.*

*You heard about this place from the newspapers and picked up a brochure at your local travel agents. Curiosity has gotten the best of you and you decided this trip might be just what you needed.*

*Following a lengthy journey you are staring up at the tall building that houses this strange place, this is St Brides.*

*Inside is a perfect replica of a boarding school from the early 20th century. Here there is no electricity, no plastic and all of the people there are women dressed in long, old fashioned dresses and bonnets.*

*Besides the strangeness of the place, there also seems to be something that isn’t quite right here… There is a mystery hidden within these walls. You have to solve this mystery, your life might even depend on it.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The game continues in this way, immersing the player in this weird type of role playing school, where the people who run the place are referred to as “mistresses” who impose rules and speak in strange old fashioned English, while the paying visitors spend their time pretending that they are “students” at this very strict 1920s boarding school.

The mystery of the game lies with the idea that everything feels a little too real. The player seems to be the only one who has noticed that every person at St Brides is stuck in character 24/7. The other people you come across genuinely believe that it is the 1920s and as the game goes on the player’s grip on reality and the real time slowly slips too.

Gameplay was very rudimentary, I would type in answers to the game’s prompts. For example, in an early scene of the game I was asked whether I wanted to wake any the other girls sleeping my dormitory and bring them on my adventure, or if I would prefer to steal a lamp from one of them. I stole the lamp.

It continued on in this same innocuous fashion, I would enter instructions like “take newspaper” or “N, S, E or W” to go north, south, east or west respectively to move through the house’s corridors, up and down its stairs and through its creaking doorways.

The sound of the mechanical keyboard clicking as I pressed the clunky keys while playing the silent game was kind of comforting. The backdrop of the torrential Irish rainfall outside made the whole experience seem sort of meditative or hypnotic that first evening.

By the time I reached the classroom the sun had set hours before and I had been playing the game in my dark bedroom by the sickly light of the commodore and an anemic desk lamp. I had been too glued to the screen to get off my backside and switch on any other lights.

This was the point when things started to get weird.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*You are in a classroom with several tall windows. Rows of wooden desks stand sentinel before a dusty blackboard.*

*On a table you can see:*

* *A cane*
* *A piece of chalk*

*Tell me your next move:*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I took the cane, because it sounded like a weapon.

Thus far the game had been fairly dull, there was nothing creepy about it. There was no disturbing soundtrack, no gorey images, nothing that should have made me feel frightened.

But something in the back of my mind creaked, a mild sense of unease was sliding through my mind for some unknown reason. This unease made the cane the most appealing option.

Following this decision one of the “mistresses” marched into the classroom with a fleet of my fellow students following close behind. The game called her Mistress Duff and described her as tall, square and severe with dark, icy eyes.

All pretty standard stuff for a creepy old teacher.

But my mind provided me with a disturbingly vivid image of Mistress Duff. My brain concocted a copy of her so clear, that I could see her dark, grey eyes were flecked with golden-green and that they shone menacingly from the deep sockets in her sickly pale skin. I saw her dull brown hair had been scraped back into a bun, partially concealed beneath an aggressively frilly bonnet. The smell of chalk and moth balls filled my nostrils and I felt an anxious nausea rise to my throat. Her looming height cast a shadow across my mind that I just could not escape.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Mistress Duff sees you. You cannot escape. The other students stare.*

*“THAT IS MY CANE, YOU FILTHY THIEF!”*

*Mistress Duff grabs the cane from your hand.*

*“YOU NEED DISCIPLINE. ST. BRIDES WILL TEACH YOU TO BE A PROPER LADY.”*

*Mistress Duff beats you with the cane.*

*Tell me your next move:*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My vision swam and what had previously been the distant mental images of daydreams transformed into true sight.

I was **in** the classroom now.

My heart hammered in my chest as my actual eyes **saw** Mistress Duff’s face twist and sour. She peered down her nose at me with an imperious air and a hatred I had never experienced before.

I watched as she crossed the room towards me. When she grabbed the cane, I felt the palm of my hand sting with a sensation as though something had really been ripped from my grasp. I gasped and whimpered as I heard the ancient desk screech when I was pushed to lean over its side. I felt her vice grip on the scratchy fabric that made the school uniform I was now wearing.

Then the pain came. The stinging at the top of my thighs and across my bottom. It was almost as if I really was being hit with a wooden cane. I reddened with mortification, corporal punishment does not exist in modern Irish schools. It has not been an accepted form of punishment for a very, very long time. The only ideas that bounced I had about it stemmed from historical dramas or the tales my parents, aunts, uncles and grandparents would provide of their time being educated by priests and nuns in the olden days.

Then, as quick as it had happened, it was over. My vision cleared, I was not in a classroom in a creaky old boarding school, I was back in my dim bedroom. The first thing I did was to look at my hand; not a mark on it, then my backside, also spotless. But the pain lingered on both, the anxiety and nausea had remained too. The only theory I could think of was that I had been hallucinating, maybe I was a lot more tired than I had previously thought. Or perhaps I had a far more vivid imagination that I had ever given myself credit for.

Either way, after that, I did not touch the Commodore 64 for a very long time. I went to school, hung out with friends and just got on with life. Most of the time the memories of my strange experience stayed pushed away from my consciousness, but sometimes, at night when I was trying to drift off to sleep they would slam into me and refill my head with a flood of anxiety.

That March had been a record breaking month for rainfall. Some parts of Ireland, the UK and Europe had experienced flooding. We had been lucky that the river running through our little midlands town had remained within the bounds of its banks. 

When the month came to a squelching end and April took to the stage we experienced the first dry day in what felt like forever.  It had been over a month since I’d turned off the old computer and left it to gather dust. 

The trouble started on a Saturday.

I had been rudely awoken by a loud slam followed by an unpleasant crunching noise. My eyes flashed open and I twisted in my bed, legs flailing as I wrapped myself in a straightjacket of sheets. I tossed my head from side to side and my eyes were wide and staring as they took in the safety of my messy bedroom. Letting out an exasperated huffing sound I quickly calmed down and my heart rate rattled to a normal pace. Once I had untangled myself from the sheets I walked to my window and took in a tiny crack at the centre with an even tinier splotch of red that was slowly spreading into the crevices of the chipped glass.

After grabbing a hoodie and pulling on shoes I headed down the stairs, through the kitchen and out the back door into the soggy garden. The sun cast an anemic disk of watery light through a heavy curtain of sodden steely-blue clouds. And there, below the window on the cold concrete was a tiny, delicate, dead bird. Its neck was lying at an unnatural angle.

Sadly this is kind of common, little birds like this sometimes fly into the windows of Irish homes. But this bird was in worse shape than the others I had seen to have died this way. First, its skinny little legs appeared to have been snapped, it was not possible to tell what breed it was because its feathers were so soaked with bright red blood (not typical of bird-window deaths) and the worst part was its beak, the bottom half was gone, seemingly ripped from its face with force. I felt last night’s dinner resurfacing and I gagged, turning away from the tiny carcass.  My thoughts went to the neighbourhood cats first, perhaps they had been at the body before I had made it outside and that was why parts of the bird were missing and it had bled.

This was when I noticed the silence in the early morning garden. Normally, our garden would be filled with birdsong from the crack of dawn, but at that moment there was nothing. Nothing except for the increasing hiss of white noise. I recognised the huffing monotonous sound because my mother plays it sometimes to help her to sleep. From the moment that I noticed the noise the unknown source seemed to take this as encouragement and grew louder and more insistent. 

I turned to look around the garden which stretched down a gentle slope to terminate at a tall brick wall cloaked in ivy. I don’t know what I was expecting to find as I scanned the flower beds and my eyes followed the path down the slope. But I definitely was not expecting what I discovered. 

At the foot of the garden, several metres away was a figure. They seemed to glow with a faint blue-green light that emanated off its form.This figure was translucent and dressed in long dark grey robes and it had an ugly, frilly bonnet perched on the top of its head. I recognised it from my nightmares straight away; Mistress Duff. She seemed to be flickering in and out of existence like damaged film being projected onto this world. My heart stopped when I realised what she held in her large, bony hand; a lengthy piece of wood, dripping lurid red blood.

The muscles in my arms and legs turned to mush and I stared breathlessly at the horrifying visage menacing my back garden. After an eternity she turned very slowly and took a step deeper into the unmowed grass, then another. With each step the flickering increased. When she finally reached the brick wall at the garden’s end I watched her slowly passed through the grey bricks, inch by inch with a flickering, blue glow that horrible created walked through the wall and out of my garden. 

I remained paralysed for an age. The feeling in my body only returned when the cold morning air provided muscular aches and sent me shivering inside the house.

I told my parents about the bird and my father buried it somewhere in the garden. They also found the tiny creature’s state upsetting, but, like me, presumed that it must have been at the paws of the local cats. 

I did not mention the ghostly figure of a 1920s school teacher at the bottom of the garden. I knew what they would think. Mam would worry, she’d fuss about me and express care in annoying ways like by extolling the virtues and importance of taking your vitamins every morning. She would say that I was just run down and insist that I ate an unnecessarily large portion at dinner until whatever storm was plaguing me seemed to pass.

Dad would worry too in the silent, simmering way of Irish men. He wouldn’t say anything but I would occasionally catch him looking at me with concern, before he’d grunt and look away. I knew that they would both think that I had lost my mind. 

To ease my own thoughts, I convinced myself that I had been caught in a sort of waking dream, that when I had been knocked awake by the loud noise I had been in a deep REM sleep and in the clutches of a very, very vivid dream. I told myself that I saw those strange things because I was dreaming. I ignored the morbidity of the dead bird’s state and refused to acknowledge the grisly trail of blood that the ghostly thing left in its wake. 

That weekend drew to a close and Monday brought a return to my classes at university. I shuffled from one lecture hall to another, nursing paper cups of coffee to stay awake. I had not slept much since the incident with the bird and flickering visitor. 

I spent time with friends, tried my best to have fun. I even managed a genuinely laugh at their jokes occasionally, but I was not myself.

No one really seemed to notice though except Molly. She and I had been fast friends since the earliest week of our course. She was funny and clever and genuinely cared about the people in her life. It was pretty hard not to like her. We had bonded over music and books and cinema. People often joked that where one found Molly they often also found me and visa versa. 

Later that week, after a particularly dull lecture Molly and I tucked ourselves into a corner in an on campus cafe. When she asked me what was wrong I was not surprised, but still felt a spike in anxiety that I was noticeably “off” and she had spotted it. 

“Not sleeping much,” I confessed. 

She dug for more information, her face clouded with concern. I was grateful to have someone checking in with me and caring that I was doing okay, but it didn’t change that there was no way I was going to open up about video game hallucinations, mutilated birds and flickering figures haunting my family’s garden. 

Despite my secrecy, speaking with Molly did actually made me feel a little better. Maybe soon all of the events that had taken place those past few weeks would fade into a distant memory.

Unfortunately, that was not the case and there was more to come. 

That evening was when the first message appeared. I was slouching in the back of a lecture hall, trying to listen as the professor as they droned on. I was scribbling notes and after I had filled one page I turned it to continue.

I dropped my pen.

On the centre of the next page were the following words; 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Tell me your next move:*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This was the prompting message from ‘The Secret of St. Brides’. 

Why was this showing up in my notebook? 

I must have written it and forgotten. That was the only logical explanation. I ripped out the page and battled my nerves away from the precipice of an oncoming panic attack. 

I turned the page again and tried to resume note taking, but what I saw was another unsettling message scrawled across the paper;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*You have to solve the mystery, your life might even depend on it.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The messages began showing up everywhere after that. 

Statements from the game appeared on scraps of paper slid into my locker by unseen hands and inside all of my notebooks.

I really began to question my sanity when I saw both messages in the middle of the news articles I read on the train to the city or between the pages of course textbooks. The words appeared on TV screens and  in advertisements like cryptic messaging.

Not subtle. 

One day, I took a risk and decided to draw one of my friends’ attention to it. We were walking down the street past a billboard that featured a smiling family who were lounging on the new and shiny garden furniture the advertisement was touting. In the top right hand corner were the words that were all too familiar; “You have to solve this mystery, your life might even depend on it.” I turned to my friend and pointed out the strange messaging. 

I honestly wish I’d never asked them. I already harboured a fear that no one else could see these messages, but to have it confirmed was almost too much to handle. 

My friend looked at the billboard, looked at me and let out a confused laugh. Luckily they brushed it off as some strange joke on my behalf, that maybe they didn’t get my odd sense of humour, but the frown between their brows bothered me. 

Great. Now they think I’m mental.

These assumed supernatural events or psychological breaks continued to escalate. 

One day, as Molly and I were walking through college, I saw the flickering figure of Mistress Duff moving through a crowd up ahead. She drifted straight through my classmates’ bodies. I knew in my gut that her goal was singular, she was heading straight for me. I don’t remember much. My mind was filled with deafening silence, sickly green bled into the edges of my vision and I lost any sense of existing within a physical body. It felt as if I had slipped out of my skin like I had shed a heavy coat. The feeling of weightlessness came with a tsunami of nausea and I felt my eyes roll sickeningly.

Molly says she had turned and to see me stop suddenly, all the colour had drained from my face. She told me that I was shaking and my teeth chattered inside my skull. I collapsed shortly afterward and people ran to pick my crumpled form from the ground. 

I was unaware of everything except the ghostly figure which was drawing closer, stretching its enrobed hand and bony fingers towards me. 

I wish I could say that I kicked or punched at the glowing mess, I had lost any sense of myself or of time and lost consciousness. 

I was ferried home by concerned friends and spent several days after convalescing in a silent sulking state alone in my bedroom. Mam and dad are worried, but presume it is exhaustion or burn out from college. It is easier to let them believe that.

The fear that Mistress Duff’s flickering form will one day manage to reach me has been picking at the frayed edges of my mind, pulling it asunder more with each day.

With the notes and hallucinations also came the nightmares. Horrible visions of empty rooms in an old, rotting house and echoes of the thud of that helpless bird against my window blended with the screech of something being scraped down a blackboard. 

The dreams featured the sound of distant screams and the thwack of wooden canes as they snapped upon bodies. These noises and sights have stayed with me throughout the day and nag at my sanity. It feels like every time I close my eyes, they are there waiting to haunt me. 

My sleep is broken and my appetite is minimal. But I am still trying to go to class. I have started speaking with a therapist at the university. 

Initially I had hoped the therapist would diagnose me with some condition which could explain why I was seeing these things. But deep down  I know that it wont work… Not when what is really wrong with me is beyond what any of us could understand.

This is what brought me back to this horrible game. The impact of refusing to play is that in both my sleeping and waking life ‘St. Brides’ is haunting me. 

That is why I am here. I need your help. Please if any of you know anything about this old game from the 80s, the St Brides School or how to get rid of these things that are tormenting me then please, please let me know. 

But **please**, do **not** play the game. Please, please do not subject yourself to this.
