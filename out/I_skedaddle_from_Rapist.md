  
It happens when I was 19, I always have male friends. I like hanging out with them, no malicious or even dirty thoughts about it because since I was a kid, I always play with male friends. I show them respect, they showed respect as well.   
  
I started drinking alcohol when I reached the age of 18, so at 19 I'm still in the peak of "I want more alcohol mode". Rebellious and shy, quite most of the time and laughing loud, that's usually me. One time I visit a male friend in his place, to visit some blue lagoon, hiking then afterwards drinking session.   
  
So, we had a good time in the morning till afternoon, the blue lagoon was beautiful but deadly, few people died there because of unpredictable water current, so I just watch them swim while I enjoy the fresh and cool breeze from the cave and trees. Then the evening comes, and we start drinking after dinner.  I will call my friend "love" because part of his real name has it, and because I like it.   
  
He has friends that joined us, which I am not close to but familiar with their faces and names but not close acquaintance like I have with Love. Love is like a brother for me, because I grew up in a family with all girls' siblings. Love takes care of me, most like his sister. So, as we are getting tipsy, Love is checking on me, if I am still okay and still want to drink more. That time we're having rum. So, I confirmed "yes" because I don't usually get drunk easily. I have alcohol tolerance 10/10 even tequila can't bring me down easily. Not the highest grade of tequila though.   
  
So, because I felt I had too much. I decided to nap in room, while love and his friends still drinking in the living room... I wasn't worried at all because I felt safe with Love and I trusted him. And his parents are home. And it's already midnight, my body is tired from hiking. So, I fall asleep. And this is where it gets spicy, part of the event.  
  
While I was sleeping, I felt something... Like a caress trying to move my facing the ceiling because I usually lay on my side... Groggy, I thought it was just mild quakes. or maybe Love trying to put blanket on me, because he usually does that. But then, when I try to open my eyes, GOD DAMN IT!  it's one of his friends... Wondering in shock, I was speechless and when I looked for Love. He was sleeping in the living room, dead as fuck. So, I quickly push myself as far from those stinky breathing yellowish teeth individual, we call him "SBYTI".   
  
So, SBYTI got this almost closing eye expression like an uncle who was exposed from the ray of sun for 50 years, trying to give me a creepy smile like saying " Hello baby, I don't bite. But I want to lick you." Hell, those type of face wants me vomit. He was caressing my legs.  So, I try to call Love but there was no response. I wanted to scream but I don't want to create a scene. SBYTI was trying to kiss me, because maybe he thought the type of guy can manipulate me or scare me by his creepy smile. He's strong hands grip my arms tight like how Thor grip his hammer. I pull my face far away from him. And that's where I felt scared and same time in rage. Thinking of getting out, how to RUN!!! As he raises his left leg, and as groggy as I can be. With all the strength I can gather, I am fucking push him with both of my hands.  I rose. And he falls on his back on the bed and roll over to the floor!!! I get up, as quickly as I can. Grab my bag which is just next to me, because I cuddled it while sleeping. Then run to the exit, as fast as a drunk person it can be. I run like fucking crazy with no direction on a muddy soil and under the drizzling rain.   
  
I never look back, but I can hear men shouting voices that might be calling me. It was rainy evening, and muddy everywhere. I did't know what to do or how fast I did and how far but I can felt my heavy shoes and wet pants that I got while bumping into plants while running like mad. I had cold sweat and headache banging like gong.  
  
I ran out of breath, so I stopped. I am not a runner nor a breathing dragon so imagine me catching breathe while tipsy. I can still smell the strong scent of rum on my breathe, and chills on my spine everytime I remember SBYTI. As, I stand their in point blank. Sobbing, panicking triying to recall what just happened and what's the next thing I need to do. I saw Love a far trying to catch on me, and SBYTI distance from him.   
  
As I wantched SBYTI a far, I thought of killing him slowly with a screw diver. Stab him till I don't see the metal head anymore, from his face down to his feet. And leave the screw driver in the small hole of his dick like a dick extention. Then hang him upside down naked, so his blood sprinkle on the ground.  
  
Because my vision was blurry and I went to the very dark place of my existence, like the demon in me suddenly woke, I never realized that Love was just next to me. When his about to touch my arm, I block it and said "Don't you Dare!" with a voice as powerful as a demon and as deep as a Giant. After hearing that, Love step back putting his both hands on the air.   
  
Love: " Okay, I am not touching you. So, what do you want to do." (Calm voice but shaky)  
  
Me: Leave me alone.   
  
At that time I wasn't looking at Love. Nor aware of my surroundings, my eyes are fixed on SBYTI. Like a Lion watching its prey a far, waiting to bite. I can felt my heart rythm like a rolling drum vibrating in my whole body, a sign of ready to attack or die. But, something caught my attention.   
  
I saw a motorcycle, coming towards me. I checked the driver but it's dark and blurry, so I never figured his features, I raised my hand. Signal him to stop, so I can ride... They I hop in, Love try to stop me but then I leaved because in my mind I might Kill SBYTI and If I  fail, I will go to jail while SBYTI live like a nightmare hunting me in my dreams while I suffer in the dark. As I was riding, I can't help to cry. Yet, greatful because I managed to scape that daunting situation. But then, I was wrong.....  
  
The next hell, is just waiting along the road...
