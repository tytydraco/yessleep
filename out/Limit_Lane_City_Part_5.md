"Don't worry, his reign never truly ends"

There was more noise in town since the old god died. People were talking more openly. They voiced their concerns about the food louder than before. 

As I woke up the day after the assassination, Marc was already awake. He was sitting in a dark corner of the room, inspecting the god's cloak. I didn't remember him taking it with him that day. 
"Hey", I greeted him, rubbing my eyes. 
"Where did you get that from?"
I tried to be silent enough, not to wake Marleen. He didn't look up. 
"Was still at the top floor." 
"So, you walked all the way up there again to get it?", I asked confused. 
"Yep" 

I went to get food for us that day. The shelves already looked a lot emptier than they should have. People must be stocking up out of fear. As I walked past the little podium in the middle, I noticed his head propped up there. The people must have really respected this entity. I kneeled down to get a closer look. There was no darkness in his eyes anymore. I carefully touched the skull's forehead with my finger. It felt softer than expected. 

"You aren't making yourself any friends" 
Miranda was standing behind me with two loaves of bread in her arms. I got back up. She had a stern look on her face. 
"I know, I'm sorry. Can we talk?" 
She accepted. 

I walked with her to her apartment. From the inside it didn't look any bigger than our little square room. There was a lamp in the middle of the ceiling that brightly illuminated all of the room. Everything like in our apartment, except she had some nice furniture. She put her bread on a cupboard and gestured me to sit down at the table. I wondered where one would get a table from, in here. I hadn't yet seen furniture in the grocery store. 

She sat down across from me, stirring a cup of tea. 
"Soo, What do you want to know?" I wasn't sure where to start. "everything" wasn't the most useful prompt. 

"Where are we?" 
My first question made her smirk. 
"Well, limit lane city I guess, but that's not what you want to hear. I don't have any reference, really. This place has been my home for way too long." 
She stopped stirring to watch the little whirlpool inside her cup. 
"I don't know what you want me to say about it." Great, this didn't help. Except 
"So you didn't always live here? Where were you before?" 
She narrowed her eyes. Was she worried? Or maybe just thinking. 

"I remember my mom.. I think. It's been so long, I'm sorry. I know that I came here once, I surely wasn't born here. I think there was a farm… and a dog. I don't know its name." 
Intriguing. I moved a little closer to the table. 

"Do you remember how you got here? Was there a staircase?" 
She pinched the bridge of her nose. 
"I…I don't know, I don't remember. I'm sorry…" 
"Oh, my name is Luke" 
"I'm sorry, Luke. The past is way too blurry." 
It didn't matter. Knowing that she came from our world as well was a great help already. Good to know we were not the only ones who stumbled into this mess. But it couldn't have been the norm either. There were too many families with small children. At least they must have been born in here. Miranda looked at me, waiting. 

"What's outside?" 
"Outside? You mean the fields?" I nodded. 
"They stretch forever. Well, actually I can't be sure about that, haven't tried it. I walked around there a little, that was years ago though. The way back always seems shorter. I heard the other townsfolk say it's forever. Kinda trusted them on that."

 "What about the monster?" 
She raised her brows. 
"What monster?" 
I leaned back in my chair. She took a sip of her tea. For a moment I thought I might have dreamt that part. But no, it was surely real. It's the reason me and my friends never went out for long. The image of that man being ripped to pieces. I could never make such a thing up. 

"There was a monster. I saw it on my first day. It was… eating a person, I think." 
Miranda looked very confused now. 
"I've never seen one. And I don't think anyone went missing around that time. Good to know though. But anyways, nobody really goes out there for anything. The place is just dead space. Completely useless." 

Miranda was interrupted by a knock on the door. We looked at eachother. That was highly unusual. My host got up and opened the door. 

Mark was standing in the doorframe, looking past Miranda into the room. His head was almost touching the top of the frame. What was he doing here? I got up as well. 
"Hey, Luke! I've seen you come in here. I hope I'm not interrupting anything?" 
"No, no problem. What's up?" 

Guess I had to continue my questions another time. 
"Can you come to the room? I have to talk to you and Leen about something." 
He didn't speak with urgency, there was a calmness in his words. But nonetheless, the indication of what he said worried me. I thanked Miranda for her time and left with Marc.

He sat us down on the floor in our room. We became used to sitting in a circle like this for important conversations. Marleen was cuddled in a blanket. I could have used one as well. 

"Ok guys. First of all, thanks for your time!" Marc looked excited. I couldn't help but smile, seeing him seemingly motivated for something again. He continued. 
"We all know what I did and we all heard what the city people say about it. They're worried that the food will run out and stuff. And I thought, since I kinda 'put their leader out of business ' "
He put that part in finger quotes. 

"Maybe it's my responsibility to become their new leader." 
He waited for us to respond. I didn't even know how to understand his proposition. Marleen didn't say anything either. 
"Yeah, I know, I should come up with a plan to save them from their crisis first. Like, before I just declare myself major or something. But I have a plan, believe me! They can use the fields outside to plant their own food, become independent you know? They just need someone to teach them how. I grew up on a farm. I can plant things, no problem." 

Noble idea but he clearly overestimated himself there. Marc's family had a farmhouse with a vegetable garden and a few chickens and I never saw him help with any of it. Not quite the qualifications he thought he had. 

"Don't you think they will just chase you away with torches and pitchforks?" Marleen asked worriedly. "Not if I can prove myself to them. They will soon see that the death of that old skeleton was the best thing that ever happened to them. Give it time." 

I didn't want to tell Marc directly, or actually in any way at all, but I didn't like his plan. It made me uncomfortable in a way I couldn't describe or understand. Something about him taking over the place of someone he had just killed, even if that someone never looked quite alive to begin with, was just wrong. 

To my dismay, he started off his plan by now wearing the dead gods cloak everywhere. It was vastly oversized. Marc looked like a child wearing it. And it surely made the poor citizens even more uncomfortable than me. Of course they didn't like his ideas either. They never knew anything other than this exact life. I couldn't blame them. 

Marc did, he quickly became resentful. Cold towards them in all respects. For some reason, that seemed to be more to their taste. Marc reverted back to the way he behaved after we lost Cora. He barely ate, and this time, he clung onto the weird cloak more than I would have liked. He turned our apartment into a dark and depressing place once again. 

Maybe that's why I started to spend more time at Miranda's. We drank tea and told each other about our pasts. I told her about my life before we ended up here, in hopes it would help her remember her past as well. 

I told her stories about Marc and Cora, about our time in highschool and our ghost hunting trips. Actually, I ran out of stories faster than I thought I would. I learned about her life in limit lane city so far, about her crocheting hobby, and to better not ask her why people would call her a witch. That question always made her uncomfortable. 

Deja vu struck as, during one of our conversations, there was a knock on the door. A dark shadow was looming in from the crack underneath the door. Marc knew where he had to look for me. He bowed his head to fit through the small door frame and took a step into the room. 

"Hey Luke, I need you to look at something." 
He waved me over with his hand. Miranda seemed quite uncomfortable. No wonder, Marc was looking more sickly by the day. If he wouldn't start to eat normally soon, he would probably starve to death. But if things continued to go as they did, that would be all our fates eventually. 

I followed him up the broad staircase into the blinding sunlight of another never ending day. I held my hand up to block the sun from my eyes. We went a few steps into the field before he stopped me. 
"Check this out." 
He pointed at a little strawberry plant on the ground. I kneeled down. This really was interesting. 
"Did you plant that?" I asked. 
Marc was sitting down on the grass as well. "Seems like it." 
He smiled proudly. Maybe his plan wasn't so bad after all. The plant had many bright green leaves and even one ripe, red strawberry was dangling from a stem. Fascinating how it had grown so quickly. I inspected it a little closer. 
"Where did you get the seeds from? I didn't know there were any berries left in the store." 
"Yeah, funny thing." Marc said, scratching the nape of his neck. 
"I actually planted corn."
