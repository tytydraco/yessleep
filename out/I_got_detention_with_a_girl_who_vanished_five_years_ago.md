It had already been an hour since that bitch Hawthorne got us into detention, and since the beginning, she’d been texting someone—smiling like an idiot and chewing her gum like a whore.



She was either cheating on her pervert asshole husband, or worse, flirting with him. Anyway, things must’ve gotten hotter with whoever was on the other end, because she left early.



Told us to finish the remaining hour.



I was both happy and annoyed at the same time—because with that bitch gone, I could finally speak to the girl sitting near the window.



Never talked to her before. Never even really noticed her. Maybe she transferred in. Or maybe I just didn’t pay attention.



She was sitting sideways in the chair, one knee pulled up, sneaker on the seat. Hoodie sleeves over her hands like she didn’t want to touch anything. Her uniform shirt was wrinkled, and her skirt had ink stains on it—like a pen exploded on her last week and she never bothered to wash it.



She was chewing gum, slow and lazy, like the world was on pause. A notebook rested on her thigh, full of rough little doodles—flowers with too many petals, melting faces, spirals that bled into each other. She didn’t look up.



I thought maybe she hadn’t heard the teacher leave.



I thought maybe she didn’t care.



When she finally glanced over, it was like she just remembered she wasn’t alone.



“I used to sit here all the time. They don’t even lock the window properly,” she said with a giggle.



“Never seen you before. What’s your name?” I asked, getting up and walking toward her.



“I’m Cass. Who are you?”



“Juliet,” I said with an annoyed face. How come this bitch doesn’t know me? Every bitch knows That Bitch Juliet.



“Nice to meet you.”



“Are you sure you’ve never heard of me?”



“No. I’m pretty sure I haven’t.”



“You’re seriously telling me? That Bitch Juliet? NoLove Juliet? Saint Juliet? Bliss? Nothing?”



“Nope. Never heard any of that.”



I don’t know why I kept talking. Maybe I just didn’t want her to go quiet again.



I shrugged. “Well, you must be boring, then. What’d you do to get detention?”



“Same reason as always.”



Didn’t get what that was supposed to mean, but whatever. I let it go.



“So… are you always this boring, or only for me?”



“What do you want to talk about?”



“Something fun. Silly.”



She thought for a second. “Well, uhh… do you hate Hawthorne too?”



“Yeah, totally. Her ugly dick-sucking mouth irritates me so much. Her voice, her talk style—I’m wishing her to vanish so bad. Soooo baddd.”



She smiled, like I’d finally caught her attention, then joined in.



“Oh my god, I totally agree with you. I wished she burned, but she didn’t. I wished the same for Alexa too. Same result.”



“Alexa? You mean Alexa-Sexa?”



I beat up that bitch three months ago. Her stupid family whined for days, like the little bitches they are.



She does have a hot brother though.



“Is that so, Juliet?”



She tucked her legs under her and leaned closer, elbow on the desk, chin on her palm like we were best friends now.



“Is that so, Juliet?” she echoed, grinning.



“Yeah. What, you don’t believe me?”



“Oh, I believe you.”



She peeled the corner of her notebook. It came up easy—like it had been torn off and taped back too many times.



“You just don’t look like the type.”



“Because I’m pretty?” I said, flipping my hair just to be a bitch.



She laughed—quiet and scratchy, like it didn’t get used much.



“You’re funny,” she said. “I think I like you.”



“Only think?”



“Give it time.”



There was a pause. Not awkward, just still. Like we’d said something important and didn’t realize it yet.



Then I rolled my eyes. “Anyway. Hawthorne. Do you think she actually does it with Mr. Lane or is she just fake like that?”



Cass blinked slow. “I think she wishes someone noticed her that much. No one really looks at people like her. Not unless they’re screaming.”



That line stuck with me. I didn’t know why. Maybe it was the way she said it. Like she wasn’t talking about Hawthorne anymore.



I changed the subject. “Ugh. Don’t even get me started on Tessa.”



Cass perked up. “Tessa-Chess-a? The one with the eyebrows?”



“She’s shaped like a humidifier and still thinks she can pull.”



Cass wheezed. “God. Remember that party where she cried because someone threw her vape in the pool?”



“I threw her vape in the pool.”



“You did not.”



I nodded proudly. “She was annoying me.”



Cass reached out and touched my wrist lightly, her fingers cold. “You ever get tired of being mean?”



I looked at her. “You ever get tired of being boring?”



We stared for a beat, then both cracked up at the same time. It echoed weird in the empty room. 



Cass picked up her pen and started doodling again. I peeked.



She was drawing flames. Neat, tight lines of fire, curling up the side of a stick figure. The figure didn’t have a face.



“So you’re the scary type of girl, huh, Cass?”



Before she could answer, the door opened and the school’s janitor—Mr. North—walked in. Cool old man, honestly. Doesn’t bother anyone. Smells like coffee and rain.



“Time’s up, girls. You can leave now.”



I got up, grabbed my stuff, and said bye to Cass like we were friends or whatever. She didn’t say much back. Just waved.



I left the room.



Next day, in class, Hawthorne was already bitching about something. I wasn’t listening. Her voice sounds like wet socks anyway.



I leaned toward Racheal and whispered, “Yo BB, you know a girl named Cass at school?”



Racheal blinked. “Cass?”



“Yeah. Black hair. Ripped tights. Pretty in a weird way.”



She made a face like she bit into something sour. “What, is that someone from your TikTok again?”



“No, dumbass. I met her yesterday. In detention.”



“Wait, you got detention?”



She looked impressed in that fake, jealous way. “What’d you do this time, punch someone or just exist?”



I ignored her and checked my phone under the desk.



Lunch came. I asked two other girls—Zoe and Arianna. Both shrugged. One said, “Sounds made up,” and the other said, “She sounds like your type.” Fucking losers 



Later, I went to the office, said I lost something in the detention room, and asked if I could see the list from yesterday. Mr. Jensen pulled it up on the computer.



There was one name.



Mine.



“Just you,” he said without looking up. “Must’ve been a quiet hour.”



I stared at the screen a little too long. It was a spreadsheet. Basic. I could’ve sworn there were two of us. I could still hear Cass’s laugh in that room. Like static wrapped in lipstick.



I asked the teacher too—Ms. Doyle, crusty-ass ponytail and all.



She squinted at me. “There was no one else, Juliet. It was just you.”



“But the janitor—”



“Mr. North just came in to clean. You were alone. I remember. I left early.”



I went quiet and just nodded. 



A page. Torn. Folded into quarters.



Cass’s notebook paper. Still warm like it had been in someone else’s hands.



There were flames on it. The same little figure, still faceless. But this time, there were three more figures behind it. Smaller. Messier. Like someone was adding to it.



I didn’t sleep easy.



When I did, I dreamed.



The school was empty, like everyone left mid-sentence. The hallways sagged. Lockers peeled open and shut like mouths. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead, buzzing too loud, syncing with my heartbeat.



The floor was wet. Not water. Something thicker. My shoes stuck with every step.



Fire alarms blinked red down the corridor. Not flashing—pulsing. Like veins. The bell rang over and over, but no one moved. No one was there.



Except her.



Cass.



Standing at the far end. Same desk behind her. Same notebook in her hand. Her head tilted slightly, and her eyes were wide open like they didn’t know how to close.



She looked like she was smiling.



Except her mouth was sewn shut—black thread, crossing, pulling her skin tight like she’d done it herself.



Next day was normal, whatever that means. Racheal brought gross microwave pasta and tried to get me to taste it during lunch, like I’m not already doing penance just by sitting near her.



Second period was history. Same room. Same seat.



And Cass was there.



Not sitting next to me—in her old seat, near the window, legs crossed, drawing again like nothing happened. Same hoodie sleeves pulled down, same pen between her fingers like it lived there.



I blinked.



When I looked again, she was gone.



Didn’t even flinch. Just left my pen on the floor and moved on. Probably tired. Probably just a brain thing. Whatever.



After gym, I was fixing my hair in the locker mirror. Lip gloss was fading. I leaned in to smear it back on—and saw her.



Behind me.



Not standing, just sitting again. Same position. Like she belonged there.



I turned around.



No one.



Just the echo of my own lip smacking like an idiot.



I started murmuring to myself, staring into the mirror like it owed me answers.



“Jungle Juliet going mad. No fucking way. No way.”



I laughed, then didn’t.



“It’s literally impossible. Fucking bitch. How did she get in my head?”



I rubbed my face. Still me. I think.



“I’m in love. Could be? Could be. Nah. No way.”



I like boys.



Boys.



Boysss.



Right?



Or... do I like girls?



Do you like girls, Juliet?



“Scissor Juliet,” I said out loud, watching my lips move.



Then I cringed.



“Scissor Juliet? Ew. Is that good? Nah. No. Nooope.”



I smacked the sink like that would clear it.



Still couldn’t stop smiling.



I told myself I needed coffee or drugs or Jesus or something.



Then in photography class—ugh, I hate that class—I was flipping through old Polaroids we’d stuck on the back wall. Projects from last year. Stupid smiles, dumb peace signs, boys trying too hard.



And there.



Middle row, left corner. Fuzzy background blur.



Cass.



Smiling right at the camera.



Her eyes were the same. Same mascara smudge under the left one. Same vibe, like she’d just told a joke no one else heard.



I asked Ms. Quinn, like super casual: “Hey, who’s that in the back of this one?”



She squinted.



“No idea,” she said. “Probably someone’s cousin or something.”



Mmkay. Sure.



After school, I saw Mr. North mopping near the science wing. He nodded at me like he always does. I don’t know what made me ask, but I did.



“You ever heard of a girl named Cass?”



He stopped.



Looked at me a second too long.



“We used to call her Firestarter,” he said. “But that was a long time ago.”



That night I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Ended up digging through the school website archive like a psycho.



Old newsletters. Grainy PDFs. One from five years ago. Honor roll, spelling bee, blah blah. Then a line at the bottom:



"Student Hospitalized After Chemistry Lab Accident"



I clicked it.



There was a photo.



Group shot. Four girls. Three smiling. One not.



Black hoodie. Sharp bangs. Same eyes. Staring through the camera.



The article said she “went missing during recovery.”



Name redacted.



But it was her.



It was Cass.



I closed the laptop and just sat there for a while. Staring at my bedroom wall like it was supposed to say something smart.



Five years ago. Burned in the lab. Missing. Forgotten.



Except not really. Not if I talked to her. Not if she was still here.



I told myself it was a mistake. A lookalike. A glitch in the photo.



I didn’t sleep.



Next morning, I didn’t speak unless I had to. Skipped lunch. Zoned out during history.



And then Ms. Hawthorne handed me a slip after class like nothing was weird.



“Detention,” she said. “You were late again.”



I wasn’t. But I took it.



Didn’t even argue.



Room 213. Again.



Cass was already inside.



Sitting at the same desk. Near the window. Like she hadn’t moved in days.



She looked up and smiled. Not wide. Not fake. Just... soft.



"Hey," I said, tossing my bag down like I didn’t care, like my stomach wasn’t twisting up in a new, not-fun way.



"Hey," she said back. Voice lower than I remembered. Like she'd been whispering to herself all day.



I sat down across from her. She was tracing the edge of her notebook with her thumb.



“You know,” she said, “I didn’t mean to go out like that.”



I raised an eyebrow. “What, detention?”



She looked at me, really looked. Her eyes were glassy but still sharp. Like mirrors with teeth.



“No. I mean... out out.”



I didn’t say anything. I didn’t really want her to keep talking. But she did.



“They said I was unstable. Crazy. Dangerous. I just wanted someone to listen. But they called me names and locked me up and then...”



She flicked ash off an invisible cigarette.



“They forgot me.”



She smiled again, but this one was wrong. Sad, maybe. Or tired.



“I don’t think I’m supposed to be here anymore,” she added. “But this room remembers me.”



The lights flickered.



Then died.



No buzzing. No hum. Just silence, thick and full.



“Cass?” I said.



It was dark, but I saw her silhouette move. Slowly. Like she didn’t want to scare me.



Too late.



I smelled something. Flowers—cheap, crushed. And smoke.



Not fire. Ash. Like something burned out long ago and never stopped smoldering.



I tried to back up, but my legs wouldn’t move. I felt her hand touch mine.



Cold.



Then nothing.



Room 213. Again.



But I didn’t walk in this time.



I was already there.



Same desk. By the window. Same red pen. Same notebook open to a page that kept drawing itself when I wasn't looking.



I’d been here a while.



The door opened.



Footsteps. Familiar ones. Heavier than they used to be, like the hallway weighed more now.



Racheal.



She walked in slow, holding the detention slip like it bit her. Didn’t see me at first—just scanned the room like something smelled weird.



Then she saw me.



Her face twitched. Just a little.



She didn’t say hi.



Didn’t call me BB.



Didn’t ask where my lip gloss was.



She just sat across from me.



I looked up.



Smiled.



“They always leave early,” I said.



“You’ll get used to it.”



Then I went back to drawing.



The flames were softer now.



But they always caught.
