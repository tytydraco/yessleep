My thoughts were jumbled, but I could still listen.



“He was my servant,” Marcus continued, his voice soft, almost drowned out by the desert silence. “Everyone called him that. The law called him that. Society defined him that way. But to me, he was so much more than that; he was my childhood playmate, and…”



He grabbed a handful of sand, letting it slip through his fingers. “I never dreamed of marrying and having children. I never imagined having a wife, children, living the life my family expected. But I did dream of spending my life with Jacob. Growing old together, I wanted to buy an estate, and just the two of us, and endless hunting—my health would be poor then, and hunting would be my happiest time.”



The sand slipped through his fingers, and he watched it fall, a deep sadness filling his face.



“When they told me I was going to meet a woman I’d never met, and that my duty was to have children with her and continue the family bloodline, I couldn’t bear it. Not because of the woman—as far as I know, she’s a nice person. It was because they said Jacob couldn’t come with me. And I couldn’t continue my beloved medical career.”



“What happened after that?” I asked, though deep down I had a premonition.



“My illness got worse, coupled with my unwillingness, led them to call off the engagement.” His tone was calm, but I could hear the weight in it. “In my final moments, in that year when I teetered between life and death, I told myself I couldn’t die like that. I became obsessed with mysticism, I tried everything, summoning all the gods, because… I’m the youngest son of a noble family, I have the money to do it, my family just thinks I’m dying.”



He looked at me, his eyes aged, incredibly aged. “Ultimately, I chose this path. Seven hundred and forty-three years, traveling to remote places, watching the world change, yet I remained steadfast.”



“Do you regret it?”



His smile was sincere and painful. “Not at all. We spent another ten years together. I told my parents I'd found a very busy job in London, and then he got the plague, so I… I thought then, if the plague and famine were alike, I'd already tried everything, even to the point of ignoring Jacob. I could only seek out plague, because maybe I could have a chance.”



Halfway through the story, Levi, in his animal form, quietly approached. He rested his head on Marcus's lap, offering silent comfort in an animalistic way.



Marcus placed his hand on Levi's head, his fingers gently twirling his fur. “I made another deal, but this time it wasn't so lucky. He became some kind of being between life and death, and he doesn't remember me anymore. I had to trade a part of my feelings for some peace of mind.”



“That must have been hard,” I said.



Afterwards, the three of us sat quietly in the vast desert with Biscuit, the ancient skeleton casting long shadows on the sand.



That night, I dreamt of young Marcus, healthy and full of energy, standing in a stone house draped with tapestries. Jacob stood beside him, smiling, his face radiant. They stood close, yet didn't touch, but the space between them held all the unspoken emotions they couldn't express.



\-----

The second week was worse.



The heat seemed to come alive, enveloping us like a second skin. It now had weight, pressing down on my shoulders, making each breath incredibly difficult. The air was so hot that inhaling hurt; each gasp felt like burning my lungs.



The texture of the sand had changed, no longer like sand, but more like powder, fine as flour, light as ash. With each step the horses took, sand billowed into clouds, casting a pale film over everything. My skin was covered in sand, and my clothes stiffened. Sand seeped into my mouth, nose, and eyes, rough and inescapable.



We now saw more "structure." Less like buildings, more like the memories of buildings. Geometric shadows were cast on the sand, outlining the contours of walls and porches, but they had no substance. We rode across the dunes, unimpeded. I felt their emptiness, the places where people had once lived, loved, suffered, and died, now utterly deserted.



On the ninth day, we discovered the skull of our first truly gigantic creature.



We'd seen bones for days, but this one was different. The skull was the size of a house, perhaps even larger, half-buried in a dune hundreds of feet high. It was remarkably well-preserved, snow-white, with eye sockets large enough to fit a car. The teeth, the remaining fragments, were as long as me, worn smooth by centuries of erosion.



“What is that?” I asked hoarsely, my voice barely audible.



“It’s something that existed before the concept of ‘size’ existed,” Marcus said. “Before physics mandated uniformity. Things could be enlarged or shrunk as needed, and it didn’t matter.”



During the day, more and more bones appeared. Ribs, like the framework of a cathedral, arched overhead as we rode beneath them. Vertebrae, the size of buses, lay scattered across the sand like giants throwing dice. A spine stretching for miles, partially buried in the sand, formed a ridge we had to detour around, for traversing it would take hours.



The scale was unbelievable. My brain kept trying to comprehend what I was seeing, trying to imagine these bones belonged to real creatures, but this attempt undermined my ability to grasp size and space.



On the tenth day, Levi stopped moving.



We had camped the night before, and dawn broke. Or rather, barely dawn in the white sky. He was just curled up, lying there, his body rapidly shifting shape. Dog, fox, wolf, human child, and back to dog—the transformations happened so quickly I couldn't even see them clearly.



"Levi?" I crawled to his side, my body barely able to move. “Hey, buddy, we have to keep going.”



He whimpered, his voice high-pitched and desperate, but his eyes remained closed.



“He’s reached his limit,” Marcus said softly. “Hunger is eroding his ability to maintain his form. Shapeshifters need more energy than humans to maintain their form, and he’s been running out of energy for days.”



“What do we do?”



“Pick him up.” Marcus had already gone to Levi’s horse, adjusting the saddlebag to make room. “Put him with Biscuits. They’ll comfort each other.”



I carefully picked up Levi; he was so light, as if hunger had consumed him entirely, and placed him in the saddlebag with Biscuits. The dog immediately curled up beside him, offering warmth and companionship.



Levi’s eyes opened briefly, his gaze hazy and unfocused. “Dad?”



“I’m here. Rest. We’ll get there.”



“Really?”



“Really.”



He closed his eyes, his breathing gradually calming. He seemed to enter a state of hibernation, his body shutting down non-essential functions to conserve its dwindling energy.



We continued on.



On the eleventh day, the scenery changed. We descended into a valley. But "valley" wasn't entirely accurate. It was more like a depression, a vast, bowl-shaped area in the desert, perhaps once a lakebed millions of years ago, perhaps never having held water. The sand here was a darker color, almost black, its surface covered with endless spirals and swirling patterns.



"Look closely," Marcus's voice was tense. "Tell me what you see."



I looked. At first, all I saw was patterned black sand. Then my eyes adjusted to the light, and I saw them.



Scales.



Those patterns weren't formed by wind erosion. They were scales. Huge scales, each as large as a house, overlapping in perfect geometry. The entire valley floor was covered in them, a vast, boundless reptilian armor stretching to every horizon.



We were walking on something enormous.



Something buried but not dead.



Something breathing with a rhythm measured in decades.



“Don’t think about it,” Marcus advised, his own voice hoarse. “Don’t try to comprehend the scale. You’ll break down. Just ride. Just stare at that cave.”



“A cave?”



He pointed ahead. In the center of the valley, about ten miles away, there was a jutting rock, the only vertical feature in the entire depression. At the base of the rock, barely visible even from this distance, was a dark opening.



“There,” he said. “That’s where we’re going. That’s where rebirth is.”



On the twelfth day, we descended into the valley, and the temperature plummeted. Not coolness, the coolness long gone, but another kind of heatwave. This heatwave came from below, radiating upwards through the scales, as if the creature beneath our feet had a fever, as if its massive body was battling some eternal infection.



The scales trembled slightly as we passed.



Not noticeably, not quickly. But I could feel it. A subtle movement beneath the horse's hooves, a flexion and descent, as if the creature below were adapting to our weight. This swaying stirred ripples in the valley floor, the pattern of disturbance spreading outwards from below. Our path.



My horse did not waver. He moved steadily forward, his black hooves carrying an unusual certainty, firmly planted on the scales. But I could feel his tension, the growing vigilance in his muscles. He knew what ground we were on. He knew danger.



We did not camp that night. Marcus insisted we continue, saying it was dangerous to stop on the scales, but he did not explain why. So we rode in the dark, though under the white sky, day and night were almost indistinguishable, the scales shifting beneath our feet, waves of heat rising, hunger devouring everything.



I was sometimes lucid, sometimes delirious, my body moving mechanically, my hands gripping the reins tightly by muscle memory alone. Sometimes I could feel the surrounding desert. Sometimes I felt as if I were elsewhere, a darker, colder, equally empty place.



On the morning of the thirteenth day, I looked down and found I could see through my hands.



Not quite. Not like ghosts. But they were translucent, slightly translucent, as if I were fading away. As if hunger had devoured not only my energy, but also my essence, my body.



“Marcus,” I said. “My hands.”



He glanced back, his expression turning serious. “You’re nearing the breaking point. That’s actually a good thing; it means you’re ready. It means the transition will be easier when the famine consumes you.”



“Easier? How so?”



“You’ve partially dissolved. You’re somewhere in between. The feeling of being devoured won’t be like destruction, but more like completion.”



I didn’t know if his words were comforting or terrifying.



On the fourteenth day, we reached the cave.



A rock jutted out like a tumor from the scales, a massive rock out of place with the surrounding geological formations. It was dark, almost black, with shimmering textures interspersed within, like obsidian or glass. The entrance to the cave was small, barely large enough for me to walk upright, perfectly circular, so perfect it seemed unnatural.



Marcus dismounted first, his movements still steady despite two weeks in the desert. He helped me down; I nearly collapsed. My legs felt like they'd forgotten how to support my weight. Hunger consumed me completely, an emptiness that swallowed all other senses.



He took Levi and biscuits from the saddlebag. Levi was still unconscious, his form somewhere between human and animal, his breathing shallow and steady. Bisket stirred, licked Levi's face, then looked at me with eyes full of patience and understanding.



"Can you walk?" Marcus asked.



I nodded, though I wasn't sure if I really could.



"Let's begin then."



We entered the cave.



The cave was smaller than I'd imagined, almost a room. The walls were smooth stone, worn smooth by hands, time, or something else, giving them a dull luster. In the center of the floor, a scale lay embedded in the rock like a fossil.



It was about the size of my palm, shimmering with iridescence, capturing non-existent light and reflecting it into unnameable colors. Green, yet not quite green; blue, yet almost purple; red, yet shifting to gold. Like the satchel, it pulsated with the same rhythm—a heartbeat, a breath, the most fundamental pulse of life.



Marcus carefully placed Levi and the biscuits against the wall; they huddled together, the warmth of the biscuits supporting Levi's swaying body. Then he turned to me.



“This is it,” he said softly, “the place of rebirth. Here, famine devours itself, then is reborn. Here, the cycle repeats.” He looked at me, his expression grave. “Are you ready?”



I pondered this question. Was I ready to be swallowed by one of the four anchors of reality? Ready to linger for three minutes in the existential hunger of my stomach? Ready to face whatever lay ahead?



“No,” I said honestly. “But I’ll still do it.”



“This is all anyone can ask for.” He stepped back, giving me space. “Open the bag. Put it on the scale. Then step back and let things take their course.”



My hands trembled, or perhaps not, or perhaps I couldn’t tell anymore. I opened the bag with fingers that felt like someone else’s.



Famine appeared.



It didn’t appear in the form of any creature. It didn’t appear as anything with a definite form. It was more like a lack shaped into intention. A void that had learned to move. A darkness beyond darkness, which devoured light not by absorbing it, but by destroying it, making the light believe it had never existed.



It flowed from the bag like liquid shadow, like oil solidified in nothingness. With its appearance, the cave filled with that emptiness, that hollow pain, that endless, insatiable longing. The hunger I had felt for the past two weeks paled in comparison. This was the source of hunger, its origin, its pure and undiluted essence.



That thing gradually took shape. I realized it was a snake, or something like a snake. Long and sinuous, it moved with a terrifying grace. Its scales, if they were truly scales, were a deeper black than black itself.



An ouroboros.



Its head was buried in its tail, devouring its own matter in an eternal cycle of destruction and rebirth. Devouring, and being devoured. End and beginning, start and end.



I placed the bag on the scale embedded in the floor.



Famine hovered on the scale, hovering around itself, forming a perfect circle. From head to tail, from beginning to end, and from end to beginning. It pulsed the same rhythm I had felt for the past two weeks, and now I understood—it wasn't a heartbeat. It was the pulse of the universe itself, the fundamental rhythm of existence, the beat to which all things dance, whether aware or not.



Then, it stopped devouring itself.



And turned to me.



I had expected fear. I had expected to run, to fight back, to resist with every last ounce of strength I had. But what I felt was recognition. Famine knew me. It had always known me. It had been waiting for me, waiting for this moment.



This was all destined to happen. This moment was etched into my blood, into my DNA, into the very root of my existence.Structure. I was born to stand in this cave, to offer myself to hunger in this moment.



It opened its mouth, and that mouth was also its tail, and the tail was itself; before such essential existence, all boundaries are meaningless.



I glanced back.



“Three more minutes,” Marcus called, his voice tinged with tension, perhaps fear, perhaps awe, perhaps both. “We’ll be here when you return.”



If I could return, I thought.



But I didn’t say it aloud. Instead, I took a step forward, and hunger devoured me.



Hunger vanished.



This was the first thing I noticed; it was so sudden, so complete, that it took my brain several seconds to process the emptiness. That gnawing emptiness, that nothingness that had occupied my consciousness for fourteen days, simply vanished. Not because it was filled, but because I became hunger itself, and hunger feels no lack.



I found myself in a vast, tranquil, utterly peaceful place.



This space was indescribable. It wasn't dark, yet there was no light. It wasn't empty, yet there was no scene in the traditional sense. It wasn't silent, yet there was no sound I understood. It was the gap between heartbeats, the pause between breaths, the perfect stillness before action begins.



From here, I can see everything.



Everyone who has ever longed for something. Every empty stomach. Every lonely heart. Every searching soul. They are all here, connected, all part of this vast network of desire, a network like invisible threads that bind the universe together.



The children in the refugee camp, bloated from malnutrition, dream of rice.



The widow in the suburban house longs to hear her husband's voice, longs to talk to him again.



The young people in the city apartment yearn for meaning, yearn for purpose, yearn to find something that makes the long days worthwhile.



The woman in the hospital bed longs for more time, even just a little more time with her family.



The artist gazes at the blank canvas, thirsting for inspiration, yearning to find that scene that can make everything meaningful.



The prisoners, held in solitary confinement, craved human connection so intensely that it became physical torment.



They were all here. Everything. All the hunger, desire, and desperate need that had existed or would exist. This network stretched backward, across time, forward, towards infinite possibilities, connecting all lives, sharing the experience of emptiness.



I finally understood the nature of famine.



It was not destruction. It was not cruelty. It was not punishment.



It was space for growth. It was an emptiness that allowed filling. It was a void that gave form to abundance.



I saw my father, young and desperate, standing at the warehouse door. He longed to escape his inner demons. He longed to find a way out. I understood; his hunger shaped me, created the space in which I existed. His emptiness gave me form.



I saw everyone I had ever delivered to—all those difficult, struggling customers—and I understood what they all longed for. Connection. Recognition. Acknowledging their existence, acknowledging their importance, acknowledging the meaning of their existence in the universe.



The things in the thirteenth-floor hospital yearn to reclaim the essence of their lost reality.



The castle-like creature in the well yearns to regain its former memories.



The subway passengers yearn to reach a destination they can never reach.



The old man telling stories yearns to find someone willing to listen to his warnings.



The gardener, situated between two places, yearns to comfort those lingering on the border.



We are all thirsty. We all forever yearn, all try to fill the void that can never be filled, for it is this emptiness that gives us life, gives us meaning, and elevates us beyond the static objects of a static universe.



Time flows here in a peculiar way. I can feel the second hand ticking away, one second, two seconds, three seconds, but each second contains infinity. In the first second, I experienced a thousand lives, felt every kind of thirst, every desperate longing, every hand reaching for the unattainable.



In the second second, I understood what Marcus had given me: Choice.



To stay is to dedicate oneself forever, becoming part of the machine that feeds the thirsty, maintaining boundaries, letting each world operate on its predetermined path. Or to leave is to return to a mundane life, memories bound, words imprisoned, carrying knowledge yet unable to share, unable to apply, unable to use it to shape anything beyond my own understanding.



Both choices are empty in their own way. They both create their own hunger.



To stay means eternal dedication, watching my loved ones age and pass away, while I remain unchanged, experiencing the slow fading of the connection brought by immortality. To live forever with a longing, watching the lives of others unfold in cycles, while I remain detached, serving them, providing them with convenience, yet never truly participating.



To leave means silence, yearning to know the truth yet unable to speak of it, unable to share it, unable to let it enlighten the world. To live with a full understanding and a lonely emptiness, carrying knowledge like a boulder in my heart, never to be lightened, for I can never put it down.



In the third second, I made my choice. It wasn't because I wanted to do it. It wasn't because I was ready. It wasn't because one choice was better, more correct, or more aligned with my true desires. It was because one desire touched me more clearly than another. An emptiness brought me more peace.



I chose the desire for immortality over the desire for silence. I chose eternal devotion over isolated cognition. I chose to remain, to be like Marcus, guarding the boundary between existence and non-existence, however long eternity may be.



Because levi needs stability. Because the biscuit is immortal anyway, and deserves a master who doesn't age. Because the universe needs food to feed its hungry beings.



Because I realized I was good at this. I followed the rules. I returned alive. I now understand that these are not merely survival skills—they are dedication. They are service. They are the willingness to enter nothingness and return again and again, bringing nourishment to those beings who cannot be self-sufficient.



Perhaps that is enough. Perhaps that is the mission. Perhaps that is how to fill the emptiness, not by erasing it, but by accepting it, living in it, and letting it function.



Famine liberated me.



I knelt in the cave, panting, my body rediscovering how to be an entity, how to separate, how to be an independent individual. The transformation back to a single existence was so dramatic, like rebirth, as if every atom of my being had to remember how to coalesce into a single point of consciousness.



The scales on the ground were gone. In their place stood new scales, brand new and gleaming with colors never before seen. They were ready for another sixty years of waiting, waiting for patience, waiting for the slow accumulation of time, until the next rebirth.



The ouroboros devoured itself and was reborn, and I was the catalyst, the transmission mechanism, the messenger that brought hunger to its own rebirth.



Marcus stood above me, extending his hand. His face was taut, with an emotion I couldn't describe. "Welcome back," he said softly. "Exactly three minutes and fourteen seconds. Congratulations, Eric, you've completed the final delivery."



I took his hand, stood up, my legs almost forgetting how to support my weight. The hunger was gone, truly gone, no longer concealed or hidden. I felt a completely different kind of emptiness, clean and vast, like an empty bell, poised to receive whatever was to come.



levi shifted against the wall, slowly opening his eyes. When he saw me standing, alive, unharmed, he relaxed completely. His tail, now fully exposed, no longer shimmering, began to wag.



“You’re back,” he whispered, his voice hoarse, but still human. “I knew you would come back, but I was afraid you wouldn’t, but you really are back.”



Biscuit stood up, walked to my side, and pressed his warm, strong body against my legs, patient, loyal, and genuine.



I looked at Marcus. “So, what now?”



“Now, we formally present this proposal.” He took a step back, his posture formal but friendly. His expression was complex—relief, sadness, understanding, a mixture of emotions. “Eric, your contract has been fulfilled. You’ve served for three years, completed one final delivery. Now you have a choice: either pay off your debts and leave with fond memories, or accept the promotion, become a manager, and stay with us forever.”



“What if I accept the promotion?”



“You’ll become like me. Time flows differently for us, and aging hardly slows down. You’ll manage other couriers, mentor them through three years of service, and assign them tasks when they’re selected for final deliveries. You’ll witness the world change, while you remain the same. And you can never leave. Never retire. Never rest in the usual way. This service will become your existence, your purpose, your eternal present.”



“My choice is deep inside,” I said. “Just three seconds ago. I will stay.”



Marcus’s eyebrows rose slightly. “Are you sure? Do you understand what this means? Forever is a long time, Eric.”



“I understand. Someone has to do this job.”



Marcus was silent for a long time, his old eyes fixed on my face. Then he smiled, not the wide grin I was used to, but a gentler, more melancholic smile. “Choosing Eternity, the reasons are heavy.”



“The reasons for all great choices are heavy. That’s why they deserve our deepest consideration.”



“Well then, congratulations, Eric Appleby.” He pulled a business card from his pocket—I didn’t know where it came from, given we’d been in the desert for two weeks with extremely limited supplies—and handed it to me. “You’re a manager now. Welcome to Eternity.”



The handwriting on the card was exactly the same as his, elegant script on thick paper: Eric Appleby, Manager, Full-time Employee.



“Next week you’ll start training new delivery drivers,” he continued, “train them, mentor them, try to keep them alive, though many may not make it through the first month. Remember, you can no longer talk about this publicly online. No more online confessions. Work matters stay at work. Boundaries require you to act prudently.”



We rode across the desert, through the melting world, through suburbs and commercial streets, finally back to the city. The return journey seemed shorter; perhaps for me, time had become something I could freely control. The hunger gradually subsided until I could eat bread again, truly savor its taste, drink water, and feel refreshed.



The pocket watch on the coffee table displayed a new photograph: I stood in an office exactly like Marcus's, dressed in clothes that seemed too formal, too important. Behind me, reflected in the window, I could see that tall figure that had appeared in countless photographs.



But this time, I recognized him.



That was me. The me I was going to become. The manager. The eternal servant. The guardian of the borders.



I was about to start working.
