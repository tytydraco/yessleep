**Nathan's diary**

*19/7/2024*

My name is Nathan, I'm 26, and the surest fact of my life is that my grandmother passed away three, going on four years ago. I remember everything from that week. My mother's endless sobs, my sister's inability to concentrate. Grandma's death never really haunted me too much. We knew it would come for her eventually in one way or another. Elly (my sister) got her car, some furniture, and most of her money. I just got her stupid cat and small house.

It's not like I disliked Pudding in the beginning either. He was only six at the time, and he liked me a lot. I think, behind my grandmother, I was his favourite person.

Notice I used the past tense. After her death, things sure started changing.

The cat does not even look at me now. He goes to her old room and sits by the window. He doesn't play. He won't even look me in the eye a lot of the time. It's strange because he seems fine, if a little quiet, with others if I'm there. But if he's not in close proximity to me, he'll meow and cry.

All that is to say, I got worried about the little fella and set up a baby monitor in the room last month.

Not just any monitor, either. For Pudding, I wasn't willing to spend a ton of money. My grandmother used to have a monitor my mother used to know if she needed any help. I set up the monitor for the first time since her death and it worked like a dream.

Luckily, Pudding didn't really need it. He was very quiet most of the time, only making slight rustling noises here and there. The first few days, I only heard ruffling.

But then things got *weird*.

I was cleaning the house the old fashioned way. Polishing some pictures, de-furring the rug (although Pudding didn't use it that much now anyways), the works. Suddenly, I heard a cough from the monitor. And the strangest thing, the cough was human. Specifically *grandma*. I had heard her make that same cough dozens of times before her passing.

Thinking I was going crazy, I continued sweeping. Everything seemed normal again. There weren't any more weird grandma-like sounds.

For an hour.

Another cough. I stood there. Shocked. It was her cough, it was her. Her. I started running to the room. Broom still in hand, I burst into the room.

It was just Pudding. Sitting innocently on the bed.

"Damn cat," I cursed. I started examining the monitor. There must be some sort of recording feature that had picked up my grandmother's cough while she was still living. But I could see none. I pawed through the thing for an hour. No recording feature in sight. I was pissed off at this point. I didn't want to hear my grandmother, only her cat.

I googled it. The monitor we had didn't even have any recording features. It was truly live. You couldn't play anything back. Something was wrong.

I just figured that was some odd issue. I went back to my boring life. Until, I was about to sleep. Today Pudding had decided to sleep on my bed for once.

"Pudding. Come here."

My grandmother. Her voice from the monitor. Calling her, or my, our? cat. Pudding jerked up. *He hears her too.* Without pausing, Pudding leapt off my bed and sprinted out of the room. To her room, surely. I jumped up too. It made no sense that I could still hear her.

Running through the dark and silent house, my head was thumping. It was just a recording, right? *Why am I so afraid?*

But the room was black. Pudding's eyes shone in the darkness. He was alert. I turned on the light. Once again, no-one. I looked in every corner, assisted by Pudding. She was nowhere. Stricken with fear, I picked up Pudding, disconnected the monitor and ran back to my room, shutting the door. This had to stop.

I was alert. Pudding kept on scratching at her door, but this I was certain: no-one would be entering that room again. I knew there was something wrong with that monitor. Maybe Google was wrong, but then how was it playing a different recording?

I heard her cough almost every day. Despite me disconnecting the monitor, her old cough still could be heard through the house, privy of the monitor that was supposed to be dead...

Occasionally she'd call for Pudding. It got more creepy when she started asking for people. My mother. My sister. Never me. It was like I didn't exist on her monitor.

SHE'S GOING TO KILL ME!!! Shes calling and the door is open. "Nathan, Nathan." It never turns off. And so I have something to confess.

I killed her. By accident, but still. I asked her to go to the pet store to get some more treats for Pudding. On her way, she got into a car crash. Elly and my mother don't know. They shouldn't know. That's why she's calling for me. Her end goal? Get me to die as I deserved to 3 years ago
