Back in the late '90s, a kids' show aired on PBS for a short time called *Pip's Garden.* It followed a friendly puppet named Pip, a small brown creature with wide eyes, a floppy green hat, and an innocent smile. Pip would wander through a whimsical, pastel-colored garden, talking to flowers, mushrooms, and insects who all had charming personalities and catchy songs about kindness and friendship. I used to watch it every morning before school, just like a lot of other kids.

But one episode was different.

It was rumored among fans and conspiracy theorists that there was a "lost episode" of *Pip's Garden.* It wasn't aired on PBS, but some claimed it circulated on VHS among the show's crew. No one had proof of this, but people talked about it in internet forums. I never believed it—until last month.

A friend of mine, who works at an estate sale company, told me about a peculiar VHS tape she’d found in an old, dusty box. It had no label, just the words "Pip’s Garden" scrawled on it in permanent marker. Curious, I borrowed it, figuring it was just some early demo or unaired pilot. But I was wrong.

When I played the tape, it started out normal. The intro music played, a simple xylophone melody that sounded familiar but slower, almost warped. As the camera panned over Pip's garden, I noticed it looked more rundown than usual. The colors were dull, and the flowers were drooping, their eyes half-closed as if they hadn’t slept. Pip himself appeared, but his eyes were different, larger and darker, with a blank expression that made him look almost... tired.

The episode's title card flashed briefly—*Episode 13: “Pip’s Secret.”* This title was strange because *Pip's Garden* never had episode numbers, and none of the known titles mentioned a “secret.”

The camera panned over to Pip as he wandered the garden, his usual cheerful humming absent. He stopped at a flower, which, unlike the usual lively, colorful flowers, looked wilted and decayed. Pip's mouth opened slightly, as if he were about to speak, but then he just... stared. The silence dragged on for too long, and when he finally spoke, his voice was strange, deeper than usual, and distorted.

"Do you want to see what’s really here?” Pip asked, looking directly at the screen. The camera zoomed in unnervingly close on his face as his eyes widened to an unnatural size. I felt a chill, but I kept watching, transfixed.

The screen flickered, and suddenly, Pip was in a different part of the garden. This area was unfamiliar—it looked dark, almost like a forest, with twisted, leafless trees surrounding him. Pip walked slowly, his head twitching slightly as if something was wrong. At one point, he turned around sharply, looking over his shoulder like he’d heard something following him. I was gripped with dread; it felt too real.

Then, Pip started whispering. It was hard to make out, but he was saying something about "the roots" and "the children." He kept repeating, "They’re still here. They're still here in the dirt." His voice cracked, sounding more frantic with each word.

The camera zoomed in on the ground, where the dirt began to shift as if something was moving beneath it. Faint cries could be heard, muffled and distorted, like children calling for help. Pip looked back at the screen, his mouth twisted into a strange, unnatural smile.

"Would you like to meet them?" he asked, his eyes wide and unblinking. He began digging into the ground, his hands moving frantically, pulling up clumps of earth until something white and bony peeked out from beneath the soil. It looked like a small hand, twisted and skeletal, clutching something.

The camera cut to black for a few seconds. When it returned, Pip was back in the garden, but his appearance had changed—his face was smeared with dirt, his clothes torn. He looked directly at the camera, his eyes hollow and dark, the once-innocent puppet now horrifying.

"They wanted to leave," he said, almost whispering. "But I kept them. Forever and ever."

The screen flickered, showing brief, horrifying flashes of buried faces in the soil, pale and still, with empty eye sockets staring up into the darkness. Then, it cut back to Pip, who slowly raised one hand and pointed at the screen.

“Come play in the garden," he said, voice flat and menacing. "We have room for one more.”

The episode ended abruptly, the screen going black with no credits. I sat there in the dark, unable to move. I tried rewinding the tape to show someone else, but when I played it back, the episode was just static.
