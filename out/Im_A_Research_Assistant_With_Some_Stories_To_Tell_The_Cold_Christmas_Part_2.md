&#x200B;

I burst back inside and ran to the waiting room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where the fuck were you?” Brice yelled upon seeing me. “We’ve been looking for you everywhere and then we hear gunshots. What happened?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Everyone was staring at us including Estrella. Having caught my breath, I explained myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Everyone, there’s someone dangerous outside. I don’t know who they are, but they killed Officer Murphy Leeson.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

People gasped as I continued and some said they knew him. I held up the radio.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“He was already dead when I found him and I got this from him.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I held up the radio, explaining my fruitless attempt to call for help. Everyone began yelling questions.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Everybody, please, I don't know any more than you. I was trying to get to our car when I stumbled across all this. I came back as soon as I did. Just know that we need to be cautious of anyone else coming in.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some hospital staff helped calm everyone down. I gestured for Brice and Sheila to follow me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, tell us what happened,” Sheila said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The boom of the shotgun echoed throughout the snow. Whatever these things were, they didn’t seem immune to gunfire. The one I shot fell unmoving into the snow.  That chiming noise sounded again. It still sounded too far to be coming from any of these things that were after me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Several of them tried advancing at once.  They were close together so I didn't have trouble hitting some of them. As I did, I was working my way back to the hospital. Even though I was armed, I was severely outnumbered. As soon as I shot down one I could already see two more silhouettes behind it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The entrance wasn’t far. However, between the storm and whatever those things were, it may as well have been miles away. I mowed them down one after the other. My heart stopped when I reached into my coat pocket and found no shells. Not a second later one was on me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I shielded using the shotgun and for the first time, I got a good look at one of these things. Its face was like if a kid drew a face into a snowman with a stick.  Its expression was drawn into a frown and I noticed a faint blue light coming from inside its head. Its fingers ended in sharpened points which were currently wrapped around the shotgun. Then its mouth split open, revealing rows of teeth resembling broken glass and it chopped down on the barrel.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It bit a shotgun in half,” I said emphatically.

“How were you able to escape?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Brice and Sheila's eyes widened when I partly lifted my hoodie.  The handle of the service pistol was sticking from my pocket.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I had to empty almost half the magazine just to kill one of them, but it gave me enough time to escape.”

“Are we safe in here?” Sheila asked.

“We should be. I'm thinking the heat’s what’s keeping them away.”

“So why are they here then?” Brice inquired.

“Still working on that. I’m willing to bet whatever’s creating them is responsible for the freak storm.”

“Zane?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We turned to see a woman in a security uniform. Her badge read “Linda Smith”.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I'm the head of security. We heard what happened in the waiting room. Would you mind if I asked you some questions?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced at Brice and Sheila who got the hint and left the room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What do you need to know?” I asked.

“Everything you can tell me about when you found Officer Leeson.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I relayed what I saw, leaving out the part of the weird ice monsters.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“And the gunshots?”

“I’m not sure. I only found him after they went off.”

“Why did you go to him instead of straight back here?”

“I was hiding behind a car. I figured if I wasn’t careful I’d be spotted by whoever he was after.”

“I see and you came across him on your way back?”

“Exactly.”

“Was his radio the only thing you took?”

“Yes, but like I said, nobody is responding.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Linda held out her hand and I placed the radio in it. She turned it on and spoke into it. Also not getting anyone on the other end, she turned it off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’ll be holding onto this.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I could tell from her overall demeanor that she didn’t trust me. However, given the present circumstances, I wasn’t a top priority.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Sorry to bother you. Go on back with your friends.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I watched her leave. Then I returned to the waiting room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What was that all about?” Brice asked me.

“Nothing we need to worry about right now. Do you know about Jamal?”

“Estrella’s husband?” Sheila asked.

“That’s right. Did she tell either of you what happened to him?”

“Only that he was attacked at work.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I relayed what she’d told me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“With Leeson gone, Jamal’s the only one who might be able to help.  The issue is getting Estrella to let me speak with him.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I think I can help with that,” Sheila said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Brice and I talked while she went to persuade Estrella.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, I got a bunch of holiday shit on my phone.  How about Rudolph? It’s a classic.  If you want something less conventional, I have Die Hard. Oh, and that Krampus movie that came out a few years ago.”

“I’ve never seen It’s A Wonderful Life.”

“Wait. really? Dude. it’s a classic. “

“I know. I just haven’t gotten around to watching it.”

“Well, we can fix that.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sheila came back to us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How’d it go?” I asked.

“I did it, but she says it might be a while before he’s well enough to talk.”

“I guess waiting’s all we can do for now.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sheila joined us in our movie watch. Halfway through, something harrowing occurred to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A hospital that size has multiple generators, each for a different purpose. If those things wanted to get inside, they would be the only thing in their way. I sprang to my feet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane, what’s wrong?” Sheilas asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I went to the desk.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Can I help you?” a nurse asked.

“Where are the hospital’s generators located?”

“Why do you need to know that?”

“Just tell me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I raised my voice higher than I meant and some people looked my way.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Sir, I’m going to have to ask you to calm down.”

“Sorry, it’s important. Please, I just really need to know.”

“Alright, fine, they’re fenced off near the lower parking garage, but you’d need a key-”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was already about to leave the room before she could finish her sentence when Brice and Sheila yelled after me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Jamal’s in danger. Keep him safe,” I told them and left my friends to explain what I meant.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Shitty I know, but I had bigger worries.  I scolded myself for being so stupid.  Earlier, I figured they might be after Jamal and thought he'd be safe as long as he was inside. My mistake came in assuming that what was controlling the ice creatures wouldn’t be smart enough to try and find a way to get rid of the heat. Now I was mad dashing to stop these things without virtually no plan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I threw open the door to the stairs. Getting into the parking garage, I could already hear them. I peered over the railing and saw a group of them trying to break through the generators’ fence. I pulled out my gun to fire and reconsidered. I couldn’t risk it at that angle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I needed to get closer.  Before that, I needed to see if there was something around to help me. Something touched my shoulder. I spun around, with my gun raised, pointing it directly at Linda’s face. Her eyes were understandably bugging out of her skull and I imagine mine were too. I  immediately lowered my gun. Before  I could say anything, she’d already drawn her gun. Her breathing was heavy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Give me that, right now.”

“Linda, I-”

“Now!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I complied, handing over my gun, and then she got out her cuffs. She snapped them on me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wait,” I pleaded, “will you just look over where the generators are?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She did and none of those things were there anymore.

“I-. there was something-”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Linda shut me up with a shove to the back. Brice and Sheila’s mouths were on the floor when we were walking back through the waiting room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guys,” I tried to say.

“Keep moving, “ Linda ordered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We went to the elevator and she hit the button. We stepped on and it ascended.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where are you even taking me?” I asked.

“Well, standard protocol would be for an officer to come and take you away,  but since that’s not an option right now, you’ll be staying where we can keep an eye on you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She took me to the security room. In it, I could see several other security guards watching monitors.  I was pushed to the floor and she told the others not to let me out of their sight.  They asked what I’d done and she relayed our encounter in the parking garage. One of them whistled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You better count yourself damn lucky she didn’t shoot you there,” they said.

“He was probably getting ready to shoot the generators,” Linda replied.

“Why would I do that?” I asked.

“How the hell should we know? It seems like you hear about some people doing fucked up shit every day. Maybe, you’re just another one of those sickos.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I threw my head back in frustration, then calmed myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I understand your position, but will you at least hear me out?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Linda rolled her eyes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alright, the floor is yours.”

“Okay, now I know this is going to sound crazy.”

“I think we’re past that point.”

“Right, anyway…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I was finished, they all just stared at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I was wrong,” Linda said. “You don’t need to be in a prison cell. You need to be in one that’s padded and maybe those friends of yours do too if they’re hanging around you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“No,” I snapped, “they don’t have anything to do with this. It’s all on me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I thought about what Deam might do if he were in my position.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Are their cameras near the generator area?” I asked.

“They’re snowed over.”

“God damn it, look, the generator area must be prioritized. I’ll deal with whatever shit later. Just do that or we’ll all be fucked.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Linda was about to respond when the lights flickered.  I closed my eyes and mentally cursed. Linda had her own radio and a voice came from it, sounding panicked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Someone, respond, please!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Linda answered, hitting a button on her radio.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Garner, calm down. What’s wrong?”

“I was out to my car to grab something and I saw these things. I’ve never seen anything like them. It’s like they’re made of ice.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Under other circumstances,  I might have enjoyed the look Linda had upon hearing that. As it stood then, though, all I felt was that the walls were closing in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where are you now?” Linda asked.

“Under my car.”

“Why aren’t you inside?”

“One of them tried to attack me and I dropped my keys.”

“Okay, try to stay safe and then we’ll come and help you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chiming came from Linda’s radio, and then Garner screamed before he became eerily quiet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Linda, it’s beautiful.”

“Garner, what are you talking-”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A Blair of static cut off Linda.  She shut it off, leaving us all in shocked silence.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you believe me now?” I breathed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Knowing her back was against the wall, Linda reluctantly agreed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, let’s say we buy all this. How do we go about stopping it?”

“Uncuffing me would be a good start.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was sitting up shortly later, rubbing my now free wrists. I rotated them some to get the blood flowing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, does anyone have gas cans in their cars?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Several people replied they did.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Are they full?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They replied yes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Does anyone have a lighter?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A guard took one out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This is going to be a lot to ask, but do you all think you can hold them off?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some of their faces either broke out in sweat or went entirely pale.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“For how long?” Linda asked.

“If those things are after Jamal, I need to talk with him. Do you think you can make it half an hour?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Everyone considered this before slowly each one of them raised a hand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Good, let’s get going then.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Linda and the others put on their coats and we left the security room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, can I ask you something?” I said to Linda as we walked to the elevator.

“What is it?”

“Why aren’t you a cop or something like that? I bet you’d be good at it.”

“My job here pays well enough. Besides, guarding the patients here is different. It’s more personal. Not to mention, I’ve heard stories from women who were in the force and they weren’t pretty.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I thought back to hearing Stella mention something similar to Dean. I nodded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What about you?”

“What about me?”

“Why do you do what you do? You have to be only what, seventeen?”

“Sixteen, I’m tall for my age.”

“Yet, you’re doing all this. How come?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Three things keep me up. The how, the what, and above all, the why. To this day, I’m still having trouble answering it. The easiest response would be to say it’s because it’s what I know. However, that would be a lie, or at least, it wouldn’t be the entire truth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I want to figure that out someday,” I replied as the elevator doors opened.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She gave me the radio back and then we split off on the entrance floor and I went back to the waiting room with Linda. Brice and Sheila were no longer there. Neither was Estrella.  She cleared things up for me at the front desk and asked where they went. A nurse told her they went to see Jamal, whose room was on the top floor and at the other end of the hospital.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Of course it is,” I said, exasperated.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were given the room number, and then Linda went to join the other security guards while I rushed to meet with my friends.  I didn’t think the elevator would get me there fast enough so I took the stairs. My lungs were burning by the time I got up to the final step. Up ahead, I could see Brice and Sheila.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where’ve you been?” Brice asked.

“Where’s…Estrella?” I breathed out.

“Seeing if Jamal is awake.”

“It took a lot of explaining after we saw you in handcuffs,” Sheila said.

“Yeah,  sorry about that, and thanks.”

“No problem.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The door opened and Estrella came out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane, you’re back. Is everything okay?”

“It’s fine. How’s Jamal?”

“He just woke up. You want to see him now, right?”

“Yes, but would you mind if I saw him alone first?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Estrella glanced at Brice and Sheila who gave her reassuring smiles.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That’s fine. He wanted me to grab something from the vending machines anyway. You can go on in and see him.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I gave a nod to my friends when she left and then went into the room.  Despite being partially bandaged, Jamal was still sitting up with Lanna on his lap. I would’ve found the scene endearing if not for the urgency of the situation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You must be one of the kids Estrella told me about,” he said.

“Can you still hear the chimes?” I replied, cutting straight to the chase.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He stopped with Lanna resting peacefully on his chest. His breathing got heavy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m not sure what you’re talking about.”

“Look, I know this is sudden, but I’m trying to get rid of what attacked you.”

“It’s here?”

“The security here is trying to hold off. We need to work fast. Will you help?”

“Okay, first, tell me who you are.”

“I’m Zane. Now that we have intros out of the way, have you done anything unusual over the past week or so?”

“What do you mean?”

“Is there anything you did that you felt strangely about it after?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Jamal thought about it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The only thing I can think of is I bought this.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

From under the covers, he pulled out a pendant.  It was gold-chained and attached to a shape that resembled a glass heart surrounded by silver wings. In the glint of the light, I thought I could see the wings move slightly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where did you get that?”

“I was trying to find a present for Estrella and I came across a-”

“Let me guess, an antique shop or something like that, right?”

“How’d you know?”

“Do you remember what it was called?”

“I think it was after someone’s name.”

“I thought so.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Places such as that are an anomaly. How the owners of these places get away with it is by hiding in plain sight. It’s easier to get away with in a town and especially a city. There are numerous stores people never take notice of. Therefore, when they notice one of these places even if they get a weird feeling they convince themselves it was always there and they just never noticed it. Then when it mysteriously vanishes the next day as tends to happen, they convince themselves they imagined it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Buying something from these places is another matter and,  hopefully, made obvious by this post, is heavily discouraged.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Sorry to do this, but I think that necklace is the key to stopping them. I know it’s for Estrella. Talk to my friends and they can pull some strings to get her something nice.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He agreed and handed over the pendant. It almost seemed to pulse in my hand. I imagine Jamal also experienced this. It’s our body’s way of weaning us against such things. Unfortunately, the sensation never lasts long enough to be heeded. I went back out and showed it to Brice and Sheila.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wish me luck,” I said at their mesmerized expressions.

“What are you planning to do with it?” Sheila asked.

“Give it to its proper owner.”

“Be careful, man,” Brice told me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I gave him and Sheila a nod and went off.  Heading back to the parking garage, I radioed Linda and the others.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane, this isn’t looking good. We don’t have much left to fight with. They’ve gotten some of us. Fuck, I  think they’ve broken through to the generators.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When she said that, the lights flickered. Hurrying down the stairs, I opened an exit door and went out into the parking garage. I could see Linda and the others ahead. However, I couldn’t stop.  I went back out into the blizzard for the last time.  I took out the pendant and held it up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This is what you want, right?” I shouted. “Take it and fuck off.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This time,  there weren’t chimes. No, it was the ringing of bells so intense it made waves in the snow. I glanced over at the monsters and they were still. I looked over at where Linda was and she was also unmoving. This wasn’t merely in my head either. My evidence for this was seeing the flakes hovering in midair.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Curious, I pinched one between my fingers and examined it before flicking it away.  The snow once again shifted and then parted, providing a grassy path. I checked on the pendant again, more for luck than anything, then stepped forward.  The bells rang louder and the blizzard was still raging around me. Up ahead, was a shape, something multi-winged and standing in the snow like a bird roosting.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The wings were shaped similar to the kind you’d find on a condor. Yet, their translucence gave them an almost insect quality.  Even from that distance, I could it pulsing. The wings folded around the body rose and fell with every breath. I took the necklace and threw it at the thing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It landed with a faint thud in the snow in front of it. What I hoped would happen after I did that was for it to vanish along with the pendant and those things it conjured. Instead, numerous eyes opened on its wings. They reminded me of those possessed by deep sea creatures except much older as if it copied them from something that died long ago in the blackest trench. I got the sensation of being a worm on a hook with a hungry fish focused on me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well?” I forced myself to breathe out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Suddenly, chains shot from the entity, wrapping around me. I didn’t even have time to scream before my mouth was covered.  I could see ice frozen on each link and they were bone-chillingly cold even through my clothes, rendering movement impossible. The only reasons I can think of to explain this behavior was that it either felt disrespected or it just needed some kind of living tribute. I wasn’t thinking about that at the time as I was struggling to free myself to no avail.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was lifted and held above it. The ground opened in a circle around it, causing the snow to become a fall. Past the entity, there was a place of ice full of living things, some humanoid and some not, pining for warmth. I mean, in a place that cold, what else could they have been searching for? Its wings flapped and it slowly lowered with me along with it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That place, the moment part of me entered it was like my brain was freezing over. From experience,  I know that almost forgetting everything was the worst thing that has ever happened to me. To this day, I can’t explain exactly how I survived. All I’m able to recall is that when I was fully in its domain, it made those bell sounds again except there was a distinct distressed quality to them. Why, I have no idea.

&#x200B;

The next thing I knew, I was being launched upward and back to the land of the living. I was high enough in the air to touch power lines before gravity reared its ugly head. I landed in the snow, immediately feeling several of my limbs snap. At least the cold had numbed me. Plus, the blizzard was gone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, look, it's snowing,” was my last thought before I was overtaken by injury and exhaustion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I woke up to the illuminated ceiling of a hospital room. I tilted my head up, seeing my right arm and left leg were both in casts. I didn’t understand the physics of my fall resulting in that. It almost felt like a cruel joke by the universe, or a present, in this case. The one I had to look forward to was several months of hobbling around.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Holy shit, you’re awake.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Brice was beside me in a chair.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You’re probably wondering how long you’ve been out.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I nodded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alright, but don’t freak out two days.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I shot up and instantly regretted it as pain shot through my body.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Easy, what did I say?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Two whole days.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, Merry Christmas Eve,” I said.

“Yeah, same to you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced around and my eyes fell on something. It was a gift basket, a rather large one.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What’s that?”

“Oh, that’s a present from Estrella and Jamal. Super nice dude, by the way. Sheila told Estrella we were wanting to get into welding so she would let us talk with him, but I’m actually considering it. That reminds me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Brice pulled out something from behind the chair. It was a metal Kingdom Key replica.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Jamal and some of his friends helped make this for you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That’s really nice of them. Hey, how did I get back inside?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Brice was inspecting the weapon. Then he stared at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“When the storm cleared, I went out and found you lying in the snow. Freaked me the hell out seeing your arm and leg bent that way.”

“You carried me in?”

“No need to thank me. It’s what friends do. Plus, I got to sign your casts first.”

“Let me guess. You drew a penis on one.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Brice feigned offense.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I would never. I also drew a vagina on the other.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As I was wishing I had something nearby to throw at Brice’s head, the door opened. Sheila came in with some soda and a stack of pizzas. She nearly dropped them when she saw me, but Brice helped her with the food.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Have you two been here the whole time?” I asked.

“Of course, we were worried about you,” she replied.

“That means I made you miss your family gathering. I’m sorry.”

“Don’t be. You saved us. Besides, it's more fun here than somewhere you get asked the same questions by different people. Oh yeah, Dean called. I hope you don't mind us answering for you. When we told him what happened he said he was going to fly out, but he had “certain obligations”, whatever that means.”

“No, I think I get it.”

“Right, well, he paid for these pizzas so how about we dig in?”

“Hell yeah,” Brice said,” Linda hooked us up with this as a thank-you gift.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He held up a bag of brownies that I knew were enhanced.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This should help take the edge off. Trust us. You deserve it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We spent hours watching TV, talking, and eating pizza. I didn't have much trouble using my other arm. I’m actually ambidextrous. That made dealing with my injuries over the coming months slightly more tolerable. Midnight rolled around and we wished each other a Merry Christmas.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Before I fell asleep along with Brice and Sheila, I got a text from Dean.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Sorry, I can’t make it. Hope recovery is going well. The cover-up team will be sent out soon.”

“It’s fine and it's going about as well as you can expect. Merry Christmas.”

“Merry Christmas.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With that, the tale of this particular mission is done. Estrella and Jamal are hosting a gathering and they’ve invited us. If I can make time I want to go especially since I haven’t heard anything about you know who. I just hope their family isn’t big on bells. Although, I somehow get the feeling that won’t be an issue.
