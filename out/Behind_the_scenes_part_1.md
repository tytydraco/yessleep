So to start I want to say that this story probably isn't as bad as the other stuff I've read here. Goddamn, nowhere near, it's just that I want to talk about it. Seeing as it's still happening. It's not something I think anyone would keep to themselves. How do I put this? We as humans just have the urge to pass off experiences to others. As a way to cope, shift a little bit of the weight off our backs. Or maybe it's more like how a virus makes you want to cough or sneeze. Just that right now I can't share it with anyone physically. And even if it's comparatively tame, I guess. I couldn't exactly think of anywhere else to post it. I'll get into the meat and chilling stuff you sickos probably want to read (I would, as a user of this site myself):

The way this starts is with a Craigslist ad. Yeah, I know, I'm old,  
"Who uses that anymore?" etc, etc. My friend apparently, because he was the one who introduced me to this whole deal. Seeing as we both knew there was something more productive, and profitable, to be doing than meeting up at the pub on weekends and weekdays. A whole hell of a lot more profitable. Saw that in my inbox as I checked for the hundredth time if I'd received a call back in any of my job applications just this morning. So the words: 'Read this right now, bitch!' Stuck out. Well checking further, I should've read it then. To get straight to the point, 3,000 dollars a day for three months of video work. Three staff members were needed. Two had already been accepted: A cameraman (already taken), an interviewer (my friend's taken role), and finally the last section was just 'worker'. Nothing on skillset or equipment like the others had, just a 'worker'. Apart from one specification: "Needs to be female." (My luck!) If you're going to comment, yes, I have heard of that one story on this very site where a woman was almost kidnapped by a man who hired her on Craigslist. And I also watched 'Creep'. Me and my friend mulled and laughed it over in the pub today at ten before we started the five-hour drive there. We mentioned that too. Could the client secretly be a serial killer looking to lure people into his home in the desolate, quiet, otherwise peaceful forest for some easy kills? Yeah, except we outnumbered him three to one, unlike 'Creep' and that other story. This means he'd have trouble if he wasn't carrying anything short of a gun, seeing as this is Canada, I doubt it. Plus what kind of, a real, serial killer tries to kill multiple people at a time, intentionally? Anyway, the drive was mostly uneventful in my friend's car. Other than that looming thought of the quarter of a million approaching.

The crunch from my thick boots wading through thicker snow was refreshing, and rising fast; like the crisp air that began to suck the heat through my clothes as soon I stepped from the pickup. The house we came to, god knows the address if it even had one, loomed over the both of us as we slowly drew to its door. Its shape, Everything seemed…geometric. A box of wood, stark and broad, in the midst of a sea of trees which it came to halves of. Rapping the areas between the joints of my fingers against the thickset door. The sound was weak and muffled by wool wrapping them. A dull, non echo. My friend and I waited for about a minute and a half. Hugging our own bodies. Tightening the grips as we stood still, shifting from foot to foot. A childish attempt to squeeze ourselves solidly enough so that cold wouldn’t slip past the cracks of our clothes. After that lingering minute and a half, I relented. Ripping my hand from its safety inside the glove. I smacked my tender and stingingly numb fist to the door. I counted three seconds of absolute, unrelenting, silence. Rolling from its hinge. I, at first, saw half an expression of nothing. Then a full smile. A man, of a somewhat slight build, stood over me. His pale bare feet between the outside and the inside. Mouth was already open to speak. Yet he blankly nodded to himself and stepped aside. Still, It was as much a relief as seeing the house itself. 

It was also a relief to note his rather dull appearance. Though maybe talking about ‘Creep’ and all this serial killer talk warped my expectations of what the client would be like. Either way. He was, almost startlingly, normal for the half day of buildup I’d been mentally doing. Regular black tee juxtaposing the ornate-seeming build of the house from the glimpse I had of the inside. Lights hanging from little black cage-like things I’d never seen before. I should probably just be thankful to be let into the place at all. My friend seemed glad. Practically throwing his shoes aside to join the other four pairs. Walking in. The client took us across a kind of lobby-like living room. Large and a bunch of space sparsely by carpets and couches. The completely artificial lighting matched the brightness outside in a warmer tone. Normally where I would picture most would put a balcony/patio glass sliding door was just the boards that encapsulated us throughout the rest of the house. I notice a man sitting idly on one of the three brown fabric couches. Black cap and vest with a white button-up shirt underneath. He matched the house better than the one who answered the door. I mean that in that he held a modicum of class above that of outside. But still rather barren. No tie, cufflinks, or any accessories besides an electronic watch. Which he seemed to check rather impatiently and often. Even then throughout the talk, the client sat us down to have.

The man who answered the door was indeed the client, and the one in the living room was the cameraman hired. It was sort of an introductory talk. But know that my summarization is the limit of what the client said. He requested that we would be staying here entirely, accommodated with all necessities, over the next three months of work. The point was we would all be doing a documentary. Him and ourselves are all important within it. All through a bit of isolation. As he put it:‘Being like that… gives the mind no distractions. Nothing to turn to… that numbs it. We’ll discover ourselves…and each other. It’ll make us all more honest. And that’s better for all of us.’ A little odd, yeah I know, the whole deal’s odd. I’m not sure how to feel about being isolated, even in a fairly big house. My friend didn’t either. Just with the sentiment, even in the way he said it, was awkward. Abrupt stunted pauses as if he was trying to remember what to say or giving time to make it as he says it. Or it’s just that English isn’t his first language, sounds like a native French speaker, and this is Canada. Even with that caveat…He’s certainly not a great conversationalist. He started it and my friend had to keep it alive as every long pause and sudden stop drove a nail into the conversation. So he asked something I’d been thinking,  
'How’d you make this money? I mean this is a pretty large house. Bet it cost you.’ 

The client did that nod to himself again, tilting his head back up from his gaze at the red patterned carpet.  
'Oh, mainly as a cameraman for rich men's pornography.’ Needless to say, that killed the conversation even more than it already was. He squinted, casting down again. Disappointed seemingly. I couldn’t read him. Not long before he wordlessly showed us to the one room the three of us workers would share. Three beds aligned in an ‘L’ motion in the slightly too long room. A fourth would’ve made it a square of beds. It’s something that nags at me as I type this in the bed. Oh yeah, we were given everything for accommodation. Even the laptop, toothbrushes, sets of clothes for the coming weeks, name it. Must’ve been some…really ritzy porn that guy was filming or something. Speaking of which: I'll call the client HG for his privacy and initials from now on. But yeah, anyway I’m typing this in bed. It’s 11:31 pm. With the light of the laptop blaring in my eyes at full brightness, I can still barely see the edges of my bed. I’m only accompanied by the laptop's electronic wheezing. It’s like there’s subtle breathing all around me.  The people responsible enough to go to sleep at this hour and whenever I set the laptop burning into my legs. I don’t know why but I’ve kept up late at this. I’d shut the laptop, listen to its breathing continue for minutes, and then eventually die down quietly. Suppose just as I said before. I’m bothered by my unsureness and (forgive my wording) creeped out. Though, hey. If weird stuff stops happening. ‘Cause know this is real life and ongoing. This series will go dead too. But hey, I’ll keep updated. Goodnight, sickos.
