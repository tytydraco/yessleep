There is a lady who wanders in and out of the the Laundromat located down the street from my apartment. 
The neighborhood is decent fresh brick walled stores lined up for convenient window shopping. Wide side walks rarely congested with the exception of the holiday parades. The onnings all decorated in different colors the chaos brings life to the small town. 
Smiling, waving and sharing pleasantries are a staple of each day. Even someone as introverted as my self can feel comfortable in this little slice of the middle class american dream. To give you a perspective on how small the town is we don't have many chain stores or restaurants. The ones we do have are family owned and you will inveivatibly run into them at least once a week on your work and home life excursions. 

The Laundromat is owned by an old couple maintained by their twins. Two bright young adults attending the community college by day restocking dryer sheets and collecting lint to add to their peculiar hobbies of creating small nick nacks from the towns people donations left on the dryers. Even these two avoid the fragile lady who seems to wander around town but only entering the Laundromat on her daily pilgrimage.

Her steps don't give the impression of malevolence but also show now signs of determination. Each step in her thick orthopedic blindingly white shoes seems planned and robotic. That is until she gets to the Laundromat. Her eyes seem to work independently like a chameleon, her nostrils flare as if to pull a destined scent from the air of the warm factory that deletes time from the costumes that the customers choose have collected to much evidence and now must be reset to neutral as not to judge them in the upcoming week. 

The lady's hair seems to become agitated from its   normaly relaxed descent down her back. Her eyes become focused her back straightens and she takes a slow breath in. Her exhale is like one of a dragon rescuing a youngling from its cold counter part. The difference is here you can see it. I'm not lying multiple times I see the air be released like compressed air used to clean out that gaming console you found at a yard sale. 

Only this time you don't find donkey Kong, Pokemon Ruby or an indie game. Her gate changes to one of royalty walking to sit at their throne. She could balance a magazine followed with a toothpick topped with a watermelon with the grace she approaches her daily discovery. Like  stroking the the shoulder of an abandoned dog she carresses a seemingly random piece of clothing and simply says.

"I only want you to have the best future possible and I believe that it will only be possible if you allow me to take this or promise me you will get rid of this article of clothing in a way that no one will wear it again. Rip it, burn it throw it out with the trash. Unfortunately if you choose to keep it I can only see a future of ash."

Now being from such a small town we tend to humor this woman. Out of respect, belief or pure remorse for the little lady that has no one to entertain her fantasies. Now I know what you're thinking ... 
"Obviously people chose not to listen and the died a horrible death"

But this isn't always the fact. Now you must be aware that that not all of the woman's choices would be shorts, pants or dresses. Sometimes they could be socks, wash clothes even blankets. At first I did believe that most just entertained her for politeness but like I mentioned earlier I am an introvert. I work remotely and try to do my errands at low peak times. 

With this extra time... I eventually found myself researching a few of the individuals that have been approached by the elderly wanderer. In a small town most people here introduce themselves with first and last names. Even if they don't my consistent failure at dating apps allows me the minimal amount of information needed to find the people who I try my best to avoid. 

To keep the story short and not represent my self as a creeper I'll give you the information on the some of the more peculiar stories I've "educated" myself on. 

Daisy Elanore Johanson
Blake Dane Collins 
Ashley Duane Gilbert 

Daisy was a bright early 20s blonde.  A bit taller than most woman... (And some men) Her pale green eyes like the inside of fresh limes. She worked at the only  motel in our town, cleaning rooms and spending time at the front desk while Walter Adams spent his time at the lake fishing waiting for the rain to stop. Doing her undergrad online and because of her superior intellect and effort she was accepted into Yale on a full ride scholarship. The town celebrated like they found oil and even though the humble D.J. declined the offer of a parade they did gift her with enough Yale merch you would think she was  a female F.B.I detective with a chip on her shoulder. In actuality she was pursuing a doctorate in mechanics and physics? Something like that. I'm sure it was her Cave Iron Man that helped her with her motel duties. 

That I feel like I should mention she built quote unquote "it seemed fun and hell it was to simple to pass up".  She even promised to return to do upgrades and maintenance for her coworkers.  

It wasn't the hoodie, sweat shirt or the ball cap.  Not a t shirt, pennant, or parent paraphernalia. 

Daisy had a service dog.
