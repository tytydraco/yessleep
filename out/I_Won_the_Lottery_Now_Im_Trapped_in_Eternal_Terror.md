I didn’t believe it at first.

The numbers rolled out on the screen, one after another, matching the ticket in my trembling hand. 9. 11. 25. 29. 35. 36. 45. 87.
The Eterna-Jackpot. The impossible prize.

I shouted in disbelief and threw my beer can against the wall. Foam exploded across the room, but I didn’t care. I had won.
Fifty billion dollars. Enough to buy everything I ever dreamed of.

I spent the night wide awake, shaking with adrenaline. Mansions, yachts, islands — I mentally bought them all. I even bookmarked a few listings online, just to make it feel real. My wife always said it was a waste of money, that nobody ever really wins.

But somebody does win. Every few years, someone claims the prize.
And this time, it was me.

I memorized every step on the lottery’s website for how to claim a jackpot. The process seemed simple. I rehearsed what I would say, how I’d react when they handed me the oversized check.

The next morning, I walked into the Eterna Lottery Headquarters, my heart pounding with excitement. The building was disappointingly plain — glass doors, white walls, a receptionist desk. No fanfare. No confetti.

I approached the desk, still buzzing with pride.
“I’m here to claim the jackpot,” I said, holding out my ticket.

The receptionist’s eyes narrowed slightly. I noticed it immediately. Something in his expression changed. For a second, I thought he looked… afraid.
“Congratulations,” he said quietly. “Follow me, please.”

I told myself he was just jealous. Maybe he didn’t like seeing someone else’s life change forever.

He led me to a sleek office, where he asked me to wait. I paced nervously, already imagining the headlines: “Ordinary Man Wins $50 Billion” — my face on every front page.

The door opened, and four men entered. Two wore tailored suits. The other two were armed guards.

I froze.

“What’s going on?” I asked, my voice cracking.

One of the suited men stepped forward. His expression was blank, cold.
“You won the Eterna-Jackpot, Mr. Fowler,” he said. “And that’s impossible.”

Before I could respond, the guards grabbed me. I shouted, thrashed, but they dragged me from the room as my vision blurred with panic.

I woke up strapped to a hospital bed. Thick chains secured my wrists and ankles. Wires ran from my chest to machines beeping steadily beside me.

“What the fuck is going on?” I screamed, yanking at the restraints.

A man in a white coat stood at the foot of the bed, clipboard in hand. His voice was cold and emotionless.
“Mr. Fowler, you’ve been convicted of time manipulation. Your claim to have won the Eterna-Jackpot is undeniable proof.”

“Time manipulation?” I barked. “I don’t even know what that means! I just bought a fucking ticket!”

He raised an eyebrow, as if he’d heard it all before.
“The odds of winning the Eterna-Jackpot are 1 in 186 billion. It is mathematically impossible for any human to win by chance. Only a time traveler could have knowledge of the winning numbers.”

Time… traveler?

I stared at him, my mind spiraling.
“We developed time travel technology in 1944,” he continued, his voice steady. “By 1927, it was banned. The manipulation of time became a criminal act punishable by eternal banishment to the Void.”

The Void.
A place outside time, outside space. Endless nothingness.

I shook my head violently.
“You’ve got the wrong guy! I don’t even know how time travel works! I’m just a fucking accountant!”

He didn’t react.
They never do.

Moments later, I felt the prick of a needle in my arm. I thrashed, cursed, begged.
Then the world went dark.

At first, I thought I was dead.
But death doesn’t feel like this.

I’m falling.
I don’t know how long I’ve been falling — hours, days, centuries. There’s no light, no ground, no sound except my own breathing, ragged and desperate.

I scream, but the sound is swallowed by the endless black.

My mind is unraveling. I can feel it. At first, I tried to keep track of time, counting seconds, but eventually, numbers lost their meaning. Everything lost its meaning.

Memories flash through my mind like fragments of a broken mirror. My wife’s face. The taste of beer. The numbers on the ticket.

They haunt me.
9. 11. 25. 29. 35. 36. 45. 87.

I’m not a time traveler.
I’m not.

But they don’t care.
Once you win the Eterna-Jackpot, you’re guilty. No trial. No appeal. No mercy.

I’m writing this now from the last flicker of sanity I have left. I don’t know how I’m doing it — I don’t know if anyone will ever read this. Maybe I’m writing to myself, trying to remind myself that I once existed.

I can feel my mind slipping away.
I see things that aren’t there — shadows, faces, whispers.
Or maybe they are there.

Maybe this is what the Void does to you.

Please, if you’re reading this… believe me.
I’m not a criminal.
I’m not a time traveler.

I just bought a fucking lottery ticket.
