When I was eight years old, I sat next to a Polish girl called Marta, who had recently joined our school. She was tiny—the smallest kid in the class—with bright blonde hair and huge, green eyes. I never heard her speak a single word to anyone and figured it was a language barrier problem. She just showed up, did her work, and kept to herself.

One day during lunch, I noticed a small commotion near the far end of the playground, by the rusted metal fence where the bigger kids usually hung out. They had Marta cornered. From where I stood, I could see them circling her, laughing loudly. One of them—a tall, gangly kid—held Marta's lunch money in his hand, waving it just out of her reach.

Her green eyes were wide but eerily calm. She didn’t cry or shout or even raise her hands to defend herself. She just stood there, staring back at them, silent as a statue. The calm in her face was unsettling, like she’d been through this a thousand times before.

“Hey!” I yelled, my voice breaking slightly as I pushed my way through the crowd of kids. “Leave her alone!” My voice sounded braver than I felt, and I hoped they wouldn’t notice the way my hands were shaking.

The kid with her lunch money looked over his shoulder, his lip curling in amusement as he sized me up. “Oh, look, her little boyfriend’s here to save her.” I forced myself to stand my ground.

“Just give her back her money,” I said, my voice a little steadier now. “She didn’t do anything to you.”

He walked over to me. For a moment, it felt like he might actually hit me, but then he shrugged, a smirk crossing his face as he dropped Marta's coins onto the ground. “Losers.” He spat on the ground near my feet before he and his friends sauntered off, still laughing to themselves.

Marta crouched down, picking up her coins from the dusty ground with careful, deliberate movements. I bent down to help her, handing her a few that had rolled near my feet. When she straightened up, Marta looked at me, her green eyes holding mine in a way that made me feel like she was searching for something. Then she smiled at me, and I smiled back.

Over the next few days, she started to sit with me during breaks. She always kept a pink notebook with her, and still never spoke but would write notes to me.

*'What are you having for lunch today?'* She wrote, handing me the notebook.

"My mom made me a ham and cheese sandwich," I said, "what about you?"

She scribbled in her notebook.

*'Apple and yogurt.'*

We became sort of friends. She never really interacted with anyone besides me, and most of the time we sat in silence eating or playing snake on my Nokia.

One day, I finally asked her the burning question.

"Why do you never talk?"

She stared for a few seconds, then slowly opened her mouth, wide enough for me to see inside. I recoiled instantly.

She had no tongue. The hollow cavity behind her teeth was lined with tiny blue veins crossing over each other. I felt like throwing up, but tried not to show it. She quickly shut her mouth and looked down, and I felt guilty for exhibiting such a visceral reaction. I didn't mention it again.

When the school’s new computer lab opened, it felt like a gateway to a different world. Back then, hardly anyone owned a PC, so having a whole room of them at school was a big deal. The lab was always packed during school hours, students crowding around the bulky monitors with wide-eyed fascination.

For Marta and me, the computer lab became more than just a novelty. One day after school, when the room had finally emptied out, Marta and I slipped in. At first, we just sat at a single computer, staring at the screen as if it were some magic portal. I asked her a question, and Marta started typing her replies on a blank word document, her small fingers dancing over the keys. It was much faster than her little notepad, and with the computer, there was a strange freedom in our conversations. We could actually talk in a way we never had before.

Her replies were short, sometimes misspelled, but they came fast, each message blinking onto the screen like a spark of her thoughts. She’d respond to my questions, give me her opinions on things, and sometimes—even though she couldn’t laugh out loud—she’d type out something funny, and her lips would curl into a smile as she looked at me.

She was observant, picking up on things other kids would miss, and she was bluntly honest in a way that most people weren’t. She had a wry sense of humor and a curiosity that kept her mind buzzing; she’d type out questions about my family, about what I thought of our teachers, or even the weirdest dreams I’d had. And though she’d never say it, I sensed a sadness in her, like a heavy shadow that lingered, even when she was typing something happy. Her silences, even while typing, felt heavy with things unsaid, but I didn't want to pry.

One afternoon, when the room was empty, Marta and I settled at our usual computer, the other screens in the lab glowing faintly in the dim light. The silence was thick, broken only by the hum of the machines. I was about to start talking about our project when I noticed a shift in Marta’s posture. She was tense, fingers flying over the keyboard as her eyes darted to the door every few seconds, as if she thought someone might come in.

*'I did something bad',* she typed suddenly, her fingers barely hesitating as the words appeared on the screen.

She sat stiffly beside me, her expression unreadable, eyes flicking back and forth between me and the screen.

"What do you mean?" I asked. She looked down.

*'You HAVE to promise to keep it a secret',* she typed.

"You can tell me. I won’t tell anyone," I said naively.

*'I locked my mom in the basement.'*

The quiet of the room seemed to grow deeper, almost oppressive.

"When?" I asked.

*'5 weeks ago. She went down and left the key upstairs. I locked it while she was still inside.'*

I could feel my heart start to race.

"Is she still… in there?"

*'I think she is. She stopped screaming after 4 days.'*

A chill crawling up my spine.

"You haven't heard anything from down there since?"

She shook her head. My stomach twisted. The clock in the corner of the screen ticked, the only sound in the silent room.

"You think she's still alive?"

Marta looked down again.

"Why did you do that?" I asked.

She shrugged.

Maybe Marta was mistaken, I told myself, clinging to that thin thread of hope as I stared at the blinking words on the screen. The implications were overwhelming. My first instinct was to tell her she needed to go to a teacher or an adult, someone who would know what to do. But every time I suggested it, her green eyes narrowed, her head shaking firmly. She typed, You promised.

Her words felt like a cage, holding me to a promise I’d made without knowing the weight of it. But I couldn’t take it back now, and besides, betraying her trust was unbearable. I knew this was serious, far beyond anything an eight-year-old should have to handle, but that didn’t matter to me then. I didn’t know what to do, but I knew I couldn’t leave her to face it alone.

When you’re eight, logic doesn’t operate the way it does for adults. You don’t think in consequences or long-term outcomes. All I could think was that Marta and I could get into serious trouble.

“Okay,” I whispered, barely able to get the word out. “Let’s… let’s just go look. Maybe there’s a way to fix this before anyone finds out.”

Marta nodded, her expression a strange mixture of relief and fear. I didn’t know what I was expecting to find, but at that moment, my plan was nonexistent. All I knew was that we had to see it for ourselves, as if the sight of it might somehow make everything clearer. Maybe her mom would be sitting in that basement, tired but alive, waiting to be let out. Maybe it wasn’t as terrible as I’d let myself imagine. Or so I hoped.

With shaky hands and a racing heart, I took her by the arm, and together we headed out of the school, each step forward tinged with a sickening dread.

After school, to the edge of town, where Marta’s house sat, half-hidden behind the branches of overgrown trees. It was a small, sagging place that looked more like a forgotten relic than a home. The front yard was littered with dry leaves and cracked flowerpots, and the paint on the walls was peeling in thin, curling strips, exposing the weathered wood beneath. An old beat up Toyota was parked in the driveway.

Marta unlocked the front door and I followed her to the back of the house. She didn’t hesitate as she opened the kitchen door, the metal hinges squeaking painfully, and led me into the dark, stale-smelling kitchen. The room was eerily silent, except for the occasional sound of creaking floorboards beneath our feet. She made her way to a small table cluttered with papers and odd knickknacks, where a single, rusted key lay. She grabbed it and glanced back at me with a look that was hard to read, then turned and led me down a narrow hallway to an old door at the end.

The door was painted an unsettling shade of dark green, the paint chipping and scratched, but it was a solid, heavy duty door. There was no breaking out of that if it was locked. Marta hesitated for the briefest moment, her hand trembling as she slipped the key into the lock. The sound of the bolt turning echoed in the empty hallway, loud and final. She pushed the door open, and it swung inward with a slow, creaking groan, revealing a steep staircase that plunged down into darkness.

The air from below was thick and cold, carrying the stale smell of mould mixed with something sharper, metallic and sickly sweet. I felt a knot of dread twist in my stomach. For a second, I wanted to turn back, leave this place, and pretend none of this had happened. But then I saw her face—pale, determined, a hint of fear flickering in her eyes—and I couldn’t bring myself to say it. Together, we stepped inside.

Each step down felt like a plunge into something darker and more twisted. Shadows clung to the edges of the staircase, and I squinted, trying to make out anything in the dim, murky light that filtered through a tiny, dust-covered window at the far end of the basement. It was barely enough to see by, casting the room in shades of grey and black.

There were stacks of cardboard boxes piled high, dusty shelves lined with unidentifiable jars, and thick cobwebs draped like curtains across the ceiling. The air was so heavy with a metallic scent that my skin prickled, and I felt a sense of wrongness creeping over me. Then my gaze drifted to the far corner, where something faintly human-shaped was slumped against the wall.

My heart dropped, and I froze, unable to look away. The shape was that of a woman, her body contorted, limbs bent at unnatural angles, slumped against the cold concrete wall. The only light touching her came from the narrow window, casting her in shadows. Her head was tilted down, her long, matted brown hair falling like a curtain over her face. She was perfectly still, almost blending into the walls.

Marta saw her too. Her fingers dug into my arm, tight and desperate, but she didn’t make a sound. I could feel her trembling, and I was sure she could feel my own hand shaking in hers. Despite every instinct screaming at me to run, to get as far away from this place as possible, I took a step forward. I don’t know what I was hoping to see, but I couldn’t look away.

We moved closer, our footsteps quiet but heavy, echoing in the silence. With each step, the shape of the woman became clearer, and the sinking feeling in my stomach grew. Her clothes were wrinkled and stained, and her fingers, pale and twisted, lay limp at her sides. As we drew close enough to make out the details, I caught sight of her hands—scratched, bruised, fingers bent inwards like she’d tried to claw her way out of something.

I was so close now that I could see a faint rise and fall of her chest. A sickening wave of relief washed over me. She was alive—but only barely.

I began to turn to Marta, to tell her we had to get help.

Then the woman’s head snapped up, her hollow, sunken eyes fixing on us with a wild intensity. Her lips parted, and a low, raspy growl escaped her throat. In one swift, jarring movement, she lunged forward, her hands reaching out, fingers curled into claws. Her grip was sudden, vice-like, as she grabbed Marta’s arm and pulled her close, holding a shard of broken glass in her hand that glinted in the dim light.

"You bitch!" She screeched, then yelled something in Polish.

Before I could even react, the woman drove the shard into Marta’s side. Marta’s eyes widened, her mouth open in a soundless scream as the glass tore through her shirt, blood quickly soaking into the fabric. The sight of it—the dark, wet stain spreading—jolted me out of my paralysis. Without thinking, I grabbed a brick that had fallen from a nearby pile, feeling its weight, its rough edges cutting into my palms.

“Let her go!” I screamed. The woman turned around just as I swung the brick into her head. The first blow stunned her, her grip loosening enough for Marta to pull away. I swung the brick again, harder this time, and felt it connect with a sickening crunch. The woman fell back, her hand going slack, the shard of glass clattering to the floor.

The woman’s body convulsed as she collapsed. I crouched down and rammed the brick into her head repeatedly until she went limp and blood started pooling onto the floor. The silence that followed was thick, suffocating.

Marta was crumpled against the wall, clutching her side, her face pale and streaked with tears. I ran over to her and dropped to my knees beside her, pressing my hands over the wound, trying desperately to stop the blood flowing. Her eyes fluttered as she began fading out of consciousness.

I desperately fumbled as I dialled 911 on my Nokia. I gave a broken description of what happened and where we were, and the operator told me to stay on the line. The operator's voice faded as I stared at Marta.

Her trembling hand reached into her pocket, pulling out a small, crumpled piece of paper. She handed it to me, her fingers brushing mine, and I unfolded it with shaking hands.

*Thank you for being my friend Daniel.*

I looked back at her. She smiled, then shut her eyes.

Somewhere above us, the faint sound of approaching sirens broke through the silence, growing louder, piercing the eerie stillness that had settled in the basement. The faint beams of flashlights eventually cut through the shadows, and voices, hurried and urgent, filled the space. I remember paramedics carefully lifting Marta, her pale, fragile form bundled onto a stretcher as they carried her out. I could barely speak, numb and exhausted, as officers guided me upstairs and out of the house, asking me questions I could hardly process. They ushered me to the police station for an interview, where I answered in fits and starts, still piecing together the night in my head. Luckily, no charges were brought against me; everyone understood I’d only tried to save Marta.

I thought that night would be the last time I’d see her. She was rushed to the hospital, and from what I later heard, she made a slow but remarkable recovery. The authorities placed her in foster care, and she transferred to another school. She became a memory, a ghost of childhood that lingered in the edges of my mind, a mixture of grief and gratitude that she’d survived at all.

Years later, when Facebook made its way into our lives, I searched for her out of curiosity. To my surprise, I found her. A message turned into a conversation, and from there, a friendship rekindled. We had both grown up, changed, and our lives were very different now, but somehow, things fell back into place. What can I say—one thing led to another, and we’re set to be married this December.

In all those years, we never talked about what happened that night. It was an unspoken agreement, as if the memories of that basement, her mother, and the things we’d both seen were too haunting to be revisited. But last week, as we sat side by side in our new apartment, Marta started texting me.

She explained how her mother’s schizophrenia had turned darker over the years, manifesting in severe paranoia. Her mother believed Marta would expose the abuse and twisted secrets she kept hidden, and had cut Marta’s tongue out to keep her silent. Marta recounted the years of hiding, the long silences, the punishments that seemed to have no end. One day, she decided to lock her mother in the basement, without giving much thought for consequences. She just wanted the abuse to stop. There were a few tanks of water among the stacked boxes and discarded junk. It was that water, Marta told me, that likely kept her alive during those weeks.

As I listened, I felt an ache in my chest, a mixture of horror and sadness, realizing how much Marta had endured in silence even after our paths had diverged. When she finished, she looked at me with a calm, almost peaceful expression, and thanked me. Not just for saving her life, but for being there all those years ago when no one else was. *'You freed me,'* she texted.

I simply nodded. In that moment, the past felt finally laid to [rest](https://www.reddit.com/user/latebutstillearly1/).
