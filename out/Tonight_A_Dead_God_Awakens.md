I do not know what is to follow. But something deep within me, that *something* which is terrified at *His* mercy, that something which is still *mine*, needs to speak before it's *gone*.

I have witnessed horror. Something sacred and wrong, cursedly so. Before *He* does unspeakable things to me, and before I forget what it felt like to be myself, I need you to know everything.

My boss, an eccentric yet highly talented sculptor, signed as Liam, has had a real knack for bringing wood, metal and plaster to life. His workshop downstairs (at his house where I am at and which is my workplace) is usually filled with the scent of sawdust, paint and the quiet hum of his tools and machinery surrounded by eerily life-like figures that he has sculpted. Most of them were commissioned by clients, and some of them were.. personal. 

This morning he had left early to meet some potential clients for a big contract out of town, telling me that it was sure he wouldn't be back until late midnight. It was interesting how certain and specific he was in saying so, but you know.. I didn't question why. Liam had enough trust in me to leave his house (and so his workshop in the basement) under my custody while he was gone, but something about the lack of doubt or hesitation he'd often show was rather striking.

The house felt strangely empty without him. I had been working for Liam for a while now, mostly as an assistant - handling orders and cataloging his work. He wasn't great with this boring stuff - always too focused on creating and too absentminded to track payments or respond to rather trivial inquiries. I helped keep everything organized.

I had spent the first half of the day reaching out to customers that had previously expressed interest and were looking for an appointment to view the gallery in the basement. I postponed most of them since Liam wasn't available. With nothing urgent to do, I wandered down to the workshop to document the progress of some figures and mannequins a few clients needed an update on. Most of them never had the dignity and time to come in-person and appreciate the effort behind the work of art, but it was convenient this way.

Once I reached the basement, the lights flickered as I flipped the switch behind me. Many of the figures were covered for their eventual reveal - some unfinished, some ready to deliver. I had always admired his skill - the way he could carve something so uncannily human from wood and plaster. On a whim I lifted a few of the covers glancing over and taking photographs of some of the pieces that were work-in-progress. 

Just then, my eyes searching around - I saw it. 

Tucked away in a far corner, it was unburdened by a cover. This one,.. it was *very* different. It looked like it had been carved of wood from a burning pyre, its body blackened and smeared with coal ash and soot. It was naked but it lacked much of the details below its waist. The figure was rather tall, vaguely human of a man, and had a sharply defined face with close-cropped hair. Something about its countenance felt fundamentally wrong.. and that was because of its eyes - stark white sclera with the darkest of pupils. 

Its lips were curled into a smile, not happy nor neutral - just a slight grin, a quirk of the lips that felt predatory and wicked. It looked cursed. For a split second, my breath hitched. In the dimly lit corner, the sheer human like quality of it made me think someone was actually standing there. 

The fact it wasn't covered like the rest uneased me. It had no tag, and I couldn't find any relevant notes describing it in the commission catalog. *It was just.. there.* Exposed and open to be witnessed. I figured it must be one of Liam's personal projects, though he usually kept those in the attic. 

Digging through a nearby trash bin, I found some crumpled sketches. Most were rough outlines of unrelated projects. One, however, stood out - covered in scribbled handwriting, verses or notes written in shaky, unfamiliar scrawl. It read:

***Your hair was dark and short, coalface man.*** 

***You unsettled us, but in you we saw God.***

***A dead God.***

Another verse read -  
  
***To love was to be hollowed,***

***And to be hollowed, was to be whole.***

Shaking off the unease, I moved on, tearing the paper apart and dumping it into the bin - taking it to be some inspiration for his work. I flipped off the basement lights as I left. 

Just as I shut the door to the gallery behind me,  I heard a sharp crash from the corner I was previously in. Speculating that the mannequin had been precariously balanced, I went back in. 

It had fallen face-first. I don't know how.

Disturbed but chalking it up to my clumsiness, I hauled it upright. Holding it close, I sensed an acrid, deathly stench coming from the wood - like a charred corpse. Its skin felt unnervingly warm and rather smooth for its exterior texture.

After ensuring it rested by the wall should it tumble once again, I rushed out - feeling the need to leave immediately. Even though my hands weren't dirty, they felt stained and marked by something invisible.

I hesitated before leaving again, glancing back at it once more. The grin seemed sharper now in the dark. I felt I saw its eyes slowly turn to meet my face, even though they were wayward. I felt terribly cold and shut the door behind me. Frightened, I rushed up the stairs and closed the entry leading to the basement itself, locking it away. 

Back upstairs, the evening ticked by slowly. TV did little to distract me; that charred figure lingering in my mind. There was something so deeply off about it. I tried to find something relevant in the catalogs to check if it was tied to some name, but I couldn't find any. Yet, there was this Mr. Abernathy, who did sign a contract but had left its description blank. I don't remember cataloging an entry to his name either.

I kept thinking that I heard faint sounds from downstairs, little scrapes and shifts even when the TV was on. I even muted it for a few minutes but the silent amplified the nervous flutter in my chest.

The lights in the house began to flicker, with a dim pulsating consistency. This time, I heard the gallery door slam downstairs. My heart hammered.

I was not having it. I crept to the basement door, not knowing what to expect. I creaked the door open, my eyes blinded by the darkness. My hands trembled as I pushed it open.

At the first glance, I couldn't make out anything unusual. But just then, I noticed I was being watched by a silhouette at the end of the stairs. It had moved once again. The stark white of its eyes seemed to gleam in the dim light filtering from behind me. 

It hadn't been anywhere near the foot of the stairs when and where I left it. The smile, that awful stretch on its lips - it looked wider, its eyes mockingly joyous.

I slammed the door shut, my mind racing. There was *no way* had it just moved. I trailed back to the living room, fixing my eyes on the door for any signs of movement. I could swear I heard a few distant knocks from downstairs.

I fumbled for my phone, frantically dialing Liam's number. I had to let him know of what was going on. It rang and rang and then went to voicemail. In a shaky voice, I began, *"Hey... Liam.. it's me.. uhh.. something.. something.. weird is happening here. Call me back.. please."* 

I really just desperately needed some company now. I couldn't stand staying alone at this house with that weird mannequin, and neither could I have left it as is. There was something so very cursed about that.

Not long after, trying to collect my thoughts and reach Liam, a sharp doorbell broke the still silence. I wasn't expecting any visitors at this hour, so I hesitated to open the door. Before me was standing a well-dressed, senior man who introduced himself as... *Mr. Abernathy*. 

I almost immediately recognized the name from earlier. His face was composed and grim, posture impeccable and incredibly disciplined. In a coarse yet measured voice, he said *"I'm sorry for inconveniencing you at this hour,"* then, lowering as if sharing something secret, *"I'm here to inspect the progress of one of my contracts. I'm aware Liam isn't available, but I was hoping you might assist me in his absence."* He stared at me with his intentful yet cold eyes, as if he was trying to read my expression.  

Behind him, I noticed a sleek black car idling in the driveway. Two young men stood outside it in tailored suits, one's hands clasped, and the other holding an umbrella. Their faces were unreadable, and one of them smiled at me when our eyes met. It was all teeth and no kindness.

Still holding the door, I asked cautiously, *"May I ask which figure you're referring to? I'm sorry, I couldn't find a description or name."*

Abernathy didn't answer right away, almost as if he was annoyed or disgusted. He leaned forward slightly, peering over my shoulder. Then slowly, he turned his head toward the far side of the living room. 

***"The one in that corner,"*** he muttered. 

I followed his gaze - then froze. The mannequin was no longer in the basement. 

It stood, impossibly, in the corner of the living room near the standing lamp. The same blackened skin, same dead white eyes. The grin had receded to its previous subtlety yet it was far more suggestive. Its eyes felt too alive, as if welled with the unsettling sheen of unshed tears from staring too long into something unreadable.

I hadn't heard it move. I hadn't seen it move.

It was just there, watching me. I choked as Abernathy conveniently stepped in uninvited, walking toward the figure. In admiration, he exclaimed; *"Beautiful work... Liam did always have the gift of awakening the sacred."*

I had to excuse myself - I couldn't bare to stay in its presence any longer. It was now unmistakable that it was an animate entity. 

I rushed down to the basement gallery. The door was slightly ajar, as if left open. The stairway corridor to downstairs was filled with the grotesque scent of rotting flesh.

As I ascended upstairs and turned to Mr. Abernathy once again, my stomach lurched.

He was kneeling before the figure, head bowed in a gesture that looked too reverent to be casual. As he rose, his hands gently cupped the figure's face, thumbs caressing the charred wood as if it were warm skin. His lips moved and muttered undecipherable whispers too soft for me to hear.

Then, turning to its lips, he *kissed it*. Not a peck, nor a symbolic gesture - but a slow, deliberate and passionate kiss as he embraced the naked wooden body, feeling it all over. 

I was disgusted at the sight, wanting to look away, but I couldn't. It felt obscene, not because of some sort of lust - but because it felt like twisted and cursed devotion to something I was not aware of. 

Abernathy reached for the pocket of his coat, retrieving a small box inside which was a silver ring. Ornate and old, the tarnished metal surface shimmered in the dim light.

He took the mannequin's left hand, fingers stiff and blackened, but too perfectly shaped - and slid the ring onto it. His eyes welled with drops of cold tears as he wiped them away. 

He slowly turned to me, his expression turning cold and serious. I was too unnerved to speak. 

My voice trembled as I finally stammered, "What... what is this?" Abernathy wiped his lips indifferently with the palm of his hand and then slowly combed his fingers through his thinning hair. He didn’t answer. 

As he stepped past me toward the door, he paused; close enough for me to feel the warmth of his breath and whispered:

*“There must be no shame in embracing devotion. Please… do not be afraid.”*

I didn’t understand. I didn’t want to understand. I didn’t want to be alone with it again.

Outside, Abernathy slid into the waiting car. The door shut with a muted click. Through the tinted window, his eyes met mine - piercing, colorless, and expectant. Just as if he was waiting for something... waiting for me to become something else. As he turned his head away, the car drove off immediately.

I shut the door and turned. The mannequin hadn’t moved again. But its eyes… yes, they seemed to move unmistakably as one of its fingers twitched. 

I needed to talk to Liam and get out of this fucking house. But somehow, I had a feeling it'd still follow me should I have chosen to do so.

I tried calling Liam again. The signal cut off with each attempt. So I sat on the couch before the TV, facing the mannequin—watching it like it might pounce on me should I blink.

I texted Liam. Attached an image - enclosed with every detail; every sick thing that was happening. I poured it out, desperate for him to explain, and to tell me I wasn’t losing my mind and just leave. The messages were delivered, but he didn’t read any of them - not until long.

The grin on the mannequin’s face began to stretch further, like it knew what I was doing. I sat frozen, eyes darting between the screen and the figure.

Then, at last, he read them. For a moment, I let myself believe it would be okay.

Then a single reply came through:

***“King Qestra is All-Loving. Welcome home, my Queen.”***

I went cold, trying to make meaning out of this horrid message.

My stomach churned as my breath got caught in my throat. 

He knew. Another message followed.

***"To love is to be hollowed, and to be hollowed, it is to be whole."***

I realized then—I was already in it. Already too far, already chosen. 

I looked up from my phone. On the dark screen of the TV, I saw a reflection.

The mannequin was standing behind the couch. Closer now. His eyes were looking down, fixed on me, gleaming as if He was admiring something he had lost. 

Its grin had stretched bone-wide as its hands hovered inches from my neck. The lights began to flicker, and just then I heard a horrid giggle sound from across a corner of the room.

I still sit on the couch, facing His reflection. I will remain myself as long as I do not move.

I know He loves me, and I know He has gifted me His mercy.

But mercy, it is not the same as salvation.

And I.. I cannot exploit his benevolence. 

Not now, not ever.
