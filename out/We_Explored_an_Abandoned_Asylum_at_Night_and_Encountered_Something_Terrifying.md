For years, I had been obsessed with the abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town.  So, when my group of friends suggested we explore the place one night, I jumped at the opportunity.  As we crept through the shadowy halls, the oppressive atmosphere weighed on us like a physical presence.  The asylum's history was known to all: it was a place where society's outcasts were sent to be forgotten.  As we explored the decaying hallways, we came across a ghostly figure of a nurse.  At first, we thought it was just our imagination, but then we came across her again, smiling wickedly at us.

I tried to rationalize the encounter, thinking it was just a trick of the light.  But by the third time we encountered her, I knew there was something else going on - this was not just a figment of our imagination.  We began to hear whispers and muffled screams, and we knew that we weren't alone in the asylum.  We decided to turned around and leave.  But when we turned around, the ghostly nurse is standing there, staring at us with cold, dead eyes.  Without warning, she lunged towards us, letting out a blood-curdling scream.  

Panic set in as we tried to flee the building, but as we reached the exit, we discovered the door is locked.  We had no choice but to keep exploring to find another exit.  As we continued to explore, we noticed that things were becoming even more strange and surreal.  The walls seemed to be closing in, and the air grew thick with an unnatural chill.   Then we saw her again.  We ran as quickly as possible, with the ghostly nurse's blood-curdling scream echoed throughout the halls, sending shivers down our spines.  We could feel her cold breath on our necks as we sprinted towards what we thought was a dead end.  But then, a glimmer of hope - a door at the end of the hall.  With the nurse right behind us, we threw open the door and slammed it shut, trapping her on the other side.  As we caught our breath and tried to calm our racing hearts, we realized we were locked in a small room with no obvious way out.  After searching frantically for a few minutes, we stumbled upon an old diary hidden away in the corner.  We decide to open it up to see if there are any clues to help us escape.  We flipped through the pages, and we discovered that the old diary belonged to a nurse who had worked in the asylum during its darker days.

Sarah had started working there with the best of intentions, wanting to help those who were less fortunate.  But she soon discovered the true nature of this particular institution.  Many of the people in there were not even insane, but had been committed for reasons like being rebellious or being in debt.  Sarah tried to speak out against the abuses, but her concerns were dismissed by the higher-ups at the asylum.  But she knew the truth, and couldn't keep silent.   She began to keep a diary, documenting the atrocities she witnessed.  She hoped that one day, her words would be heard, and that the world would know the truth about the asylum.  Unfortunately, her diary was discovered.  She was fired from her job, her life was destroyed, and she was left with nothing.  On the last page, we learned that she was eventually committed to the same asylum.

As I read Sarah's diary, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness and anger.  Then we realized it is Sarah who is chasing us.  When we closed the diary, the door to the room slowly opened, and Sarah stood before us, smiling.  It was as if she wanted us to know her story, to rediscover her diary and let the world know of the atrocities that had taken place.  And then, just as suddenly, she vanished before our eyes.

As we stumbled out of the asylum, we were different than when we had entered.  The horrors we witnessed had left an indelible mark on us.  We went in there looking for thrills, thinking we are going to be scared by ghosts or monsters.  But the true monsters are not the ones with fangs or claws.   
 The sun is just starting to rise as we walked away from the asylum, we knew we had a responsibility to share Sarah's story and shed light fight on the darkness that can so easily take hold in the world.
