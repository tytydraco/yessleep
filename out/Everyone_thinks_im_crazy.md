They say the first step to madness is denial. I wouldn’t know; I’ve never been mad. Misunderstood, sure, but not mad. What they fail to realize is that the mask I wear is the same one they all put on each day. The only difference is that mine fits perfectly, and theirs are cracking.

The asylum smells sterile, like bleach and hopelessness. It’s the kind of place where time doesn’t move—it stagnates, decays. The other patients shuffle through their days like ghosts, their minds too fractured to see the world as it is. But not me. I see everything, sharp and vivid, like looking through a crystal lens.

The doctors are fascinated by me. I hear them whisper outside my door, see the way they glance at me when they think I’m not looking. They call me a “unique case,” a “high-functioning psychopath.” That’s what they say when they think they’ve figured you out. They haven’t. Not really.

I’m here because I let myself be here. I always knew it would end this way, eventually. The police would find the bodies, the pieces of the puzzle I left for them, and they’d follow the breadcrumbs right to me. It wasn’t about getting caught. It was about leaving my mark, making sure they understood.

That’s where the letters come in.

The first woman—her name was Jane, but that’s irrelevant—was simply an experiment. A trial run. She worked at a coffee shop near my apartment. I watched her for days, noting her routine, her habits. She was plain, forgettable. No one would miss her. That was important at the time. I was still testing my methods, fine-tuning my craft.

The kill was clean, methodical. A simple slit across the throat in a dark alley, her life draining out onto the pavement in seconds. I felt nothing as I watched her die, just a quiet satisfaction in a job well done. But then, as I stood over her, an idea struck me. I reached into my jacket pocket and pulled out my lighter, holding the flame to her skin. The letter “L” came to me, seemingly out of nowhere. It wasn’t planned, but it felt right.

By the time the police found her, the flesh on her abdomen had been seared into a crude, jagged “L.” They had no idea what it meant. Just another piece of an unsolvable puzzle.

The second woman was a bit more deliberate. Her name was Emily, and she was prettier than Jane. I followed her home one evening, waiting until she was alone. This time, I took my time. I needed to see if the thrill would last, if the rush of control would stay with me longer. It did. She begged for her life, of course, they always do. But I was calm, precise.

The letter “U” was her gift. Burned into her thigh, hidden beneath her clothes, waiting to be discovered.

It became a ritual after that. Each woman was chosen carefully, their deaths like strokes on a canvas, spelling out my name letter by letter. By the third or fourth kill, I realized that it wasn’t enough just to kill them. It was about leaving something behind, a message, a signature.

The branding became my signature.

There was Patricia, who wore the letter “C” on her wrist. Sara, who bore the “I” on her lower back. Lucy, with her perfect little “U” just above her hip. The branding process became an art form, a way to leave my name on their bodies for the world to see. And the police, the idiots, had no idea what they were dealing with. Every time they found another body, they’d scramble, throwing theories around about cults, gangs, random acts of violence.

But it wasn’t random. It was never random.

I was building something. Each letter carefully chosen, each woman a necessary part of the larger picture. They just couldn’t see it yet.

I knew it was only a matter of time before they caught up with me. I wasn’t sloppy, but I wasn’t hiding either. The last woman, Olivia, was the final piece of the puzzle. I left her body in plain sight, displayed like a masterpiece in the park where she liked to jog. Her letter was the “S” the final letter in my name. The branding was perfect, the curve of the “S” crisp and clean against her pale skin.

It wasn’t long after that they came for me. The police, the detectives—they thought they were so clever, piecing together the murders, following the trail I left behind. I let them find me. I was waiting for them.

And now here I am, sitting in this room, playing the part of the broken man. The grieving husband, the misunderstood soul. They still think it’s grief that did this to me. That losing Elizabeth, my wife, sent me spiraling into madness. They don’t know that Elizabeth was just another letter. Her letter had been “S.”

The “S.” That little detail had to puzzle them, didn’t it? The police must’ve scratched their heads over that one for days. They probably thought it was a mistake—a slip-up. Maybe it even gave them hope that I wasn’t as methodical as they feared. But they were wrong, as always.

The “S” wasn’t a mistake. It was intentional, a final touch.

You see, Elizabeth had always been part of the plan. But she wasn’t just another letter, another body to complete the name. She was special. The “S” wasn’t for Lucius—it was for Silence. I wanted to leave something behind that would unsettle them, a deviation from the pattern they thought they understood. Her death wasn’t just the culmination of my work; it was a way to throw them off, to let them know that even in their supposed victory, they couldn’t fully understand me.

Elizabeth knew things about me—things I couldn’t allow her to share. Her death was necessary, but the “S” was a reminder that, no matter how close they thought they were to understanding, I would always have the last word.

The last “S” was Silence—both hers, and theirs.

I had to silence her, the way I’d silenced the others. I gave her the same treatment—careful, deliberate. Her throat, her skin, the branding. By the time they found her, it was already too late.

The police never made the connection until the bodies started piling up, the letters forming in their minds, piece by piece. By then, it was too late to stop me.

Now, they keep me locked up in here, surrounded by guards and walls that can’t hold me forever. They think they’ve caught the monster. They think the killings will stop now that I’m contained.

But the truth is, I’ve already won.

I spelled my name in blood, in flesh, and they’ll never forget it.
