I called my mom while I was still parked on the side of the road.

She answered the way she always does, like she’d been holding her phone and waiting for it to ring.

“Hey,” she said carefully. “Are you okay?”

I stared at the empty stretch of asphalt ahead of me, my headlights washing over nothing.

“I’m not,” I said. “But I will be.”

There was a pause.

“What do you mean?” she asked.

“I’m done running,” I told her. “I’m done waiting for him to decide what happens next.”

Her breathing changed immediately.

“What are you talking about?” she asked.

“I’m ending this,” I said. “Tonight.”

Silence.

“End it how?” she asked quietly.

“He told me where to go,” I said. “He wants me there.”

Another pause, longer this time.

“Where?” she asked.

I told her.

The house where I grew up. The one that’s been empty for years. The one he mentioned like it still belonged to him.

She inhaled sharply.

“Oh God,” she whispered. “Please, you don’t have to.”

“I need you to listen,” I said. “I’m not asking for permission. I just need you to know where I am.”

She started talking then. Telling me to wait. Telling me to call the police again. Telling me she could come with me.

“I love you,” I said, because it felt important to say it out loud.

Her voice broke. “I love you too.”

I hung up before she could say anything else that might make me turn around.



The balloons were already there when I arrived.

Bright red, blue, and yellow, tied neatly to the mailbox like someone had taken the time to make sure they wouldn’t blow away. They bobbed gently in the wind, cheerful and wrong.

Every light in the house was on.

I stood across the road for a long time, my car idling quietly, trying to convince myself that if I waited long enough, something would change.

Nothing did.

The front door was unlocked.

The living room looked like a party supply store had exploded. Streamers hung from the ceiling. Balloons crowded the corners. Confetti littered the floor, untouched, like it had been thrown hours ago and left exactly where it landed.

In the center of the room, the dining table had been dragged forward.

Two place settings.

Two glasses.

And a cake.

White frosting. Blue trim. Candles already pressed into the top.

My name written neatly across it.

My hand went to my phone automatically.

I didn’t even look at the screen when I hit record.

The camera opened.

Then froze.

The screen dimmed, flickered once, and went completely black.

Not off.

Just… dead.

I pressed the power button. Nothing.

Held it down. Tried again.

Nothing.

Panic crept up my spine.

“That won’t work,” a voice said behind me.

I turned.

He stood near the hallway, fully illuminated.

In uniform.

Dark blue. Badge catching the light. Duty belt secured neatly around his waist. The radio clipped to his shoulder like it belonged there.

Seeing him dressed like that, in a place like this, made my stomach turn.

“You work long enough,” he said calmly, “you learn some tricks along the way.”

He glanced at my phone.

“Put it down,” he said. “You don’t need that.”

I didn’t move.

He sighed, slow and patient.

“You always were stubborn,” he said. “Sit.”

I looked at the chair across from the cake.

“I just wanted a real celebration,” he continued, stepping closer. “All those years I missed. I thought we could finally do it right.”

His hand hovered near his holster.

The gun came out smoothly, already pointed at me.

I froze.

He watched my reaction for a moment, then slowly placed the gun on the table between us.

That gesture scared me more than the weapon itself.

“Sit,” he said again.

I sat.

He struck a match and lit the candle.

The flame wavered, then steadied.

“Go on,” he said. “Make a wish.”

My hands were shaking.

“Why?” I asked. “Why me?”

His expression softened, like I’d finally asked the right question.

“It’s simple,” he said. “You needed guidance. Your father was a terrible influence. Unstable. Violent. It was my job to protect you. To keep you on the right path.”

He tilted his head slightly.

“And sometimes,” he added, “protecting someone means removing a problem.”

My stomach twisted.

“I missed so many birthdays,” he said. “I thought we could make up for lost time.”

He bent down and reached under the table.

“Your present,” he said cheerfully.

He slid a neatly wrapped box toward me, finished with a blue bow.

“Open it.”

I didn’t want to touch it.

“Open it,” he repeated.

My fingers felt numb as I lifted the lid.

Inside were photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Me at different ages. School events. Outside apartments. Walking down streets I barely remembered. Copies of every birthday card. Police reports. Domestic call logs. Notes written neatly in the margins.

I recognized one photo immediately.

I was seven, standing in the driveway with my bike. The same day my mom said someone must have “forgotten to sign the card.”

I’d never seen that picture before.

“I wanted to remember all of this,” he said as I flipped through them. “And I wanted YOU to remember it too.”

My throat tightened.

“The first time we met,” he continued. “The first card. Watching you grow up. I was so proud of you.”

Something inside me snapped.

I stood and hurled the box at him.

Photos exploded across the room.

I lunged.

He was faster.

We crashed into the table. The cake hit the floor, frosting smearing across the carpet. I grabbed for the gun, but he slammed me backward, sending me sprawling.

He was on me instantly.

His weight crushed the air out of my lungs. His fists came down hard, controlled at first, then wild.

“Ungrateful!” he shouted, hitting me again. “After everything I did for you!”

Stars burst behind my eyes.

I tasted blood.

He straddled me, raising his fist…

A loud BANG split the air.

The pressure on my chest vanished. His body jerked violently.

Another BANG followed.

Something warm splashed across my shirt.

He slid off me and hit the floor with a heavy, unreal sound.

I lay there staring at the ceiling, ears ringing, lungs dragging in air like they didn’t know if they were allowed to anymore.

Then I turned my head.

Blood spread across the front of his uniform, dark and fast, soaking into the fabric around the badge. His mouth worked soundlessly, chest hitching in wet, broken gasps.

And then I saw her.

My mom stood in the doorway, both hands wrapped around the gun, arms locked straight like she was afraid they might move on their own. Her face was pale, eyes wide and unfocused.

We stared at each other.

Neither of us spoke.

The only sound in the room was his troubled breathing.

I staggered to my feet and crossed the room, taking the gun from her hands before she could drop it. I pulled her into me and she collapsed against my chest.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered over and over. “I’m so sorry.”

Behind us, he wheezed.

His hand twitched, then fumbled weakly toward his shoulder. His fingers brushed the radio, missed, tried again.

He pressed the button.

“Officer down,” he rasped. “I’ve been shot.”

The words came out automatic. Practiced.

Red and blue lights flooded the windows moments later.

Sirens screamed.

I told my mom to breathe. To stay calm. Not to run.

I wanted it to be over.

The front door burst open.

The house filled with noise. Boots pounding hardwood, radios crackling, voices sharp and overlapping.

Someone grabbed my arm and pulled me away from her. I stumbled, frosting and blood smeared across my clothes.

“Hands where I can see them.”

I complied without thinking.

My mom tried to turn toward me. Tried to say my name. Another officer stepped between us and guided her away.

I heard the cuffs before I saw them.

The sound hit harder than the gunshots.

“It’s okay,” I said. I don’t know who it was for. “I’m right here.”

She nodded, crying silently as they led her past me.

They sat me on the couch and asked questions I barely processed.

My name.
If I was hurt.
If there were other weapons.

I answered automatically.

I watched them give him CPR.

The radio on his shoulder crackled once as they started chest compressions.

Back at the precinct we told them everything. Exactly what happened. My mom confessed to shooting him but only to protect me. 

They let me go.

They didn’t let her go.

He died before morning.

This all happened days ago.

The house is still taped off.

My mom is still waiting for trial.

On paper, there were no threats. No recordings.

Just a dead cop and a woman who pulled the trigger.

The threat is gone.

But it doesn’t feel like it.

It feels like he planned this too.

Like even now, somewhere in the system, he’s still one step ahead.

And I don’t know how long it will take before that feeling fades…or if it ever will.
