Friday, December 13th, 2013. A night I’ll never forget, not because of the date itself, but because of what happened that evening. At the time, it felt like any other night—quiet, cold, and ordinary. My ex-boyfriend and I were driving through a desolate stretch of highway in Pennsylvania. It was 11:13 pm, and for some inexplicable reason, that time on the clock seemed more significant than I would’ve liked to admit. But it wasn’t the hour or the date that stuck with me. It was the sound. Track 13 played softly through the speakers of my car, the one I had burned on a homemade CD just days earlier. That track would soon become a haunting reminder of the worst night of my life.

We were nearing the edge of the highway when the situation took a turn. I had never let him drive before—he had just gotten his license and lacked experience, but that night, for reasons I can’t explain, I let my guard down. He begged me, pleaded with me to take a break, to let him take the wheel for once. Reluctantly, I agreed. It was a decision I would regret.

We moved forward down the darkened road, the car gently humming, the stereo playing that same track on repeat. The music filled the space, an eerie soundtrack to the quiet, isolated night. The trees on either side of us looked like dark, looming figures, shadows stretching long into the horizon. The road was empty, save for the car we occupied, and the night seemed unnaturally still. I remember glancing at the clock again—11:13 pm. A time that felt almost prophetic.

And then, without warning, everything changed.

He swerved the wheel sharply, throwing the car to the left. I felt my stomach lurch, and before I could even grasp what had just happened, he jerked the wheel to the right. The car fishtailed, sliding uncontrollably across the road. I gripped the seat, my heart pounding in my chest. The tires screamed against the asphalt as the car careened toward the guardrail. The collision was deafening—metal crumpling, glass shattering—but the worst was yet to come.

The car lifted off the ground. Time, strangely enough, seemed to slow down. I could still hear the faint rhythm of the music—track 13—playing in the background, the sound of a guitar riff interspersed with the crash of the wreck. The stars outside the broken windows flickered like pinpricks of light in a vast, indifferent sky. But it wasn’t beautiful. It was unsettling. My body was weightless, spinning violently, as though the car had become untethered from reality itself.

The car flipped in the air, again and again, and in that moment, I felt the eerie sensation of being caught in something I couldn’t control. It was as if the world around me, the air, the earth, the very universe itself had become unmoored. I could see the sky and the trees one moment, then the ground below me the next. Every flip felt endless, a chaotic spiral that I couldn’t escape. And through it all, the music played on, disjointed and out of place, as if it were mocking me in the midst of the chaos.

Finally, the car slammed onto its wheels with a sickening thud, landing in a creek that ran just off the side of the road. The world snapped back into focus, but the eeriness of the moment lingered. The air was cold, too cold, and the stillness around us was suffocating. My head slammed against the dashboard with bone-crushing force, the pain blurring my senses. I could taste blood in my mouth, and my vision swam with dizziness. The inside of the car was a complete mess—shattered glass, twisted metal, the remains of what had once been an ordinary vehicle.

I didn’t know if I was alive or not. My body was bruised, my thoughts scattered. I wasn’t sure if it was the impact or something else that had left me in such a fog. But I knew one thing: I had to get out. I fumbled with the seatbelt, but I couldn’t breathe. The windows, shattered on all sides, allowed the cold air to seep inside, making the situation all the more surreal. The faint sound of the music playing from the car stereo seemed to come from another world, distant and strange.

I climbed through the trunk, my legs unsteady. When I finally made it out, I stood there, shaken, staring at the wreckage. The night around me was unnaturally still. The road, empty. Not a single car in sight. I couldn’t even hear the sound of my own breathing. The coldness of the night seeped deep into my bones, but it was the silence that unnerved me the most. It felt as though the entire world had gone mute, as though no one was ever going to find us.

The fire trucks and ambulances eventually arrived, their sirens cutting through the eerie quiet. The paramedics looked at me in disbelief. “You’re alive?” one of them asked, as though it was something too impossible to understand. One of the firefighters stood next to the wreck, staring at the overturned car, his expression unreadable. “No one survives this,” he muttered to himself, shaking his head.

I didn’t know how to respond. How was I alive? It didn’t make sense. The wreckage had been so severe that no one could believe we had walked away from it, but somehow, we had.

Later, I learned something strange: the night before, one of my friends had a dream about me getting into an accident. The sense of déjà vu, the coincidence of it all, made the situation even more unnerving. And then there was that track—track 13—playing as we crashed. I couldn’t shake the thought that it had been somehow linked to the events of that night. I had burned the CD myself, randomly arranging the tracks, but something about the timing, the number, felt too strange to ignore.

In the aftermath, I was left with more than just cuts from the shattered glass. I had a concussion, sure, but what stayed with me was the overwhelming feeling that I had narrowly escaped something dark, something that could’ve taken me but didn’t. The crash hadn’t just broken the car; it had left a mark on me, a sense that whatever had happened that night had been part of something much larger. I could never shake the memory of those stars, or the eerie feeling of the music still playing in the background as I tumbled through the air.
 

My true story.
