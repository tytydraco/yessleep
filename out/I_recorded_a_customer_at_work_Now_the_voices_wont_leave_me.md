I don’t usually post on Reddit, but I don’t know where else to turn.
Last month I started my new job at the coffee shop. The pay was not all that much. But every bit helps. All of the customers seemed plain to start out with.

But there’s this one customer I can’t understand today.  Every night at eleven,  this guy comes in. He looks wild-eyed and creepy. I didn't want to serve him, but the boss says to serve everyone willing to pay. His voice started to become strange.

I thought it was nothing. Maybe it was how the shop sounded. I even called my boss, but they just brushed it off.
Then his voice got weirder. I thought it was the hiss of the espresso machine, the steam twisting the words in my head.
It wasn't only one voice anymore. It was quite hard to make out. But the quiet voice was calling me by name,  over and over. He was saying, “Help me!”.

I tried to be rational. I even recorded it. I pulled out my cell phone to record it. See if it was the white noise you hear from the coffee machine. It might've been that I was tired. Later on, when he was not near, I played his voice again.  It wasn't one additional voice.  It was five. All trying to come out at the same throat.

I played it back for my boss the next morning.
He didn’t laugh. He didn’t tell me it was the espresso machine. He just gave me this look—like he’d heard it before.

“Don’t talk about it,” he said. His voice was low, flat. “That guy’s been coming in for years.”

He leaned closer, glancing at the door as if the customer might walk in any second. “I went to the cops once. They said no crime had been committed. No law against… whatever this is.”

Then he just walked away, like the conversation had never happened..

I didn't get any sleep that day. The next time I saw him, I recorded him again. The additional voices weren't saying "help me”. They were calling out my name. I panicked. I told the boss I was going on break. He looked like he understood. 

That night, the customer was taken care of. He paid, sat in his usual seat, then left without a word. Nothing happened—at least not out loud. But it gave me an idea.

If audio picked up the voices… What would the video show?

So the next night, I propped my phone on the counter and hit record while I served him. I tried to act normal, smile, and hand him his coffee. Then, later, I glanced at the screen.

That’s when I dropped the phone.

On video, his face wasn’t a face at all. It was a blur—like a deck of photos shuffled too fast. Dozens of different mouths, different eyes, different people, all smeared together and flickering with every frame.

And some of them were staring straight at the camera.

The next night, I couldn’t bring myself to record him again. I was afraid of what I would see. I shoved my phone deep in my pocket and tried to act normal. I kept telling myself it was a trick of the camera, a bad screen, or recording errors.

But then something happened that I can’t explain away.

He didn’t come in. Eleven o’clock passed. Midnight. The shop was empty except for me and the buzz of the lights. I should’ve felt relieved. Instead, I felt watched.

I was on clean-up duty that night. And then, about three in the morning, I  heard it.

Not from him. Not from the door. From the speakers in the ceiling, the ones that play soft jazz after closing.

My name.

Five voices whispering at once, tangled, overlapping. The same ones from the recordings. They didn’t stop until I shut off the power.

I don’t know what to do now. I can’t sleep. I can’t even walk into the shop without feeling like they’re waiting for me.
And if I’m honest—I don’t think they’re confined to that man anymore.

I think they followed me home.
