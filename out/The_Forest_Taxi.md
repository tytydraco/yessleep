It’s been a little over a day since the Redstream Woods I visited for a quick hike turned into a taxi.

Not a regular taxi, though, of course.

It's a little... extraordinary.

I still haven't figured out how exactly it works, but I've come to some conclusions about the basics. The closest thing I'd compare it to would probably be a portal.

Also, I forgot to mention, there is no escaping it once you enter. Thought I should let that out as a disclaimer in case someone finds it appetising to try it.

Don't.

On January 6, 2025, just freshly two weeks after my divorce, I got out of home and went on my first solo trip since my wedding. The Redstream Woods: the place where I spent most of my childhood, home to my first kiss and eventually, my undoing. Let's not get too far ahead, though.

It was the core of autumn - the leaves of the trees were showing off all the tan that they kept ever since summer ended. The sky, although looking like a grumpy old man, provided a pleasing sight for my eyes as all the grey clouds sat on the sun and almost all the annoying bugs were close to being gone.

A perfect imagery for a man looking for a distraction from the gravity of his life's problems.

Nothing felt wrong at first. There weren't many tourists on the trail since it was off season. The air felt clear. Not a single sign of rain or perhaps a thunderstom to be seen.

I arrived to the top, took some pictures and selfies as I was a single man now. Needed some photos to put on Tinder.

That's when I got AirDropped an image. I turned around, looking for who could've sent it. Maybe a Tinder account wouldn't even be neccesary, perhaps I was lucky enough and caught somebody's interest here.

There was no one to be seen anywhere close, though.

"The hell?" I muttered to myself. I clicked on the image and realized how delusional I was a while ago.

And right after that, my stomach fell into knots. A sense of dread ran through me.

The picture depicted some spiral-like symbol carved into a tree. I could see myself in the background, smiling into my phone screen as I was taking a selfie.

"*Who is fucking with me?*" I thought.

And then I said it out loud. "Who is fucking with me?" I was looking in the direction of the tree the picture was taken from. After getting no response and realising that nobody's there anymore I walked towards it to see the symbol for myself. Right as I was making my way around the tree, just when my sight met the symbol, a strong bolt of lightning flashed above me, followed by a loud thunder.

I quickly ran down the trail to get out of the forest before the storm worsened, only to find an abandoned-looking cabin at the spot where the parking lot is supposed to be. The lot was nowhere to be seen, along with the road I arrived with my car through.

It made no sense. There was no way in hell I got lost. There was only one trail to follow! And besides, I'd visited this place several times in my life, I knew that hill almost as if it was my own palm.

Never had I ever seen a cabin in there.

The sky growled above me as rain started pouring agressively from the sky. I guessed I had no other choice but to enter the hut.

The state of the interior was just as bad as the exterior. There were holes in the wood panels that the floor was made from. They creaked under my weight, loudly filling the uncomfortable silence. "*Yeah, this is definitely abandoned,"* I thought.

I made my way deeper into the cabin. I walked through the entrance to what seemed to be a kitchen. There was a dusty table, no chairs to be seen, though.

*Grrr!*

The thunderstorm seemed to be getting heavier. Yeah, perfect conditions for being alone in that uncanny looking cottage. I supposed I'd just wait it out and then try to find my way to the parking lot.

Another weird realisation which occured to me was that I hadn't seen any people while going down the hill. There weren't many people when I was going up but there still were some. They couldn't have just dissapeared like that.

Right?

At the other end of the kitchen stood a doorframe without a door, creeping at me with its dark shadows. I swallowed loudly and walked towards it. At the end of the day, us humans are only afraid of the dark because it holds no certainty—only the absence of what we know, and the beginning of what we cannot comprehend. We can never be sure of what's waiting for us there, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's something bad. I peeked through.

And instantly regreted it. There was a visible outline of a human silhouette standing in the middle of the room. Shivers went down my spine.

I tried to go back as soon as I saw it, before it noticed me, but just as I made my first step backwards, the floor creaked noisily below me.

The silhouette turned around with no hesitance - just then, a bright lightning from the outside flashed across the room, showcasing the true face of the figure for a split second.

It was a man - way taller than me.

"I- I'm sorry, I thought that it's abandoned," I quickly muttered.

He made a few steps toward me, just enough so I could see him even without the weather's help. "No worries. I was expecting you. You know, I'm so sorry, but I was left with no other choice. I'm afraid this is the only solution."

He came even closer to me, and at the point where I thought he was going to just straight up kill me, he instead walked right past me and approached the door. "The only way of getting outside the spiral is to show it to someone else."

Then he left.

I just stood there for a while, confused by everything that's just happened. Next thing I knew, I was running to the exit of the cabin, the same one the weird man left through. When I opened the door, it wasn't raining outside anymore. The sky was all clear and blue.

Instead of being excited, I felt like passing out. The weather wasn't the only thing that's changed.

The forest wasn't there either. My sight was met with the waves of a blue sea, it's waves neatly sweeping through the sandy surface.

I was on a beach.

"*That... That's not possible*" I thought.

\_\_\_

I quickly realised that in this version of the world that I somehow slipped to, the definition of possible and impossible didn't exist.

Long story short, every time I opened the cabin's door I appeared in a different place. I tried reaching out to people, calling them, approaching the ones I saw at whatever landmark I was in, but it turned out to be useless. I was invisible to them. They didn't hear me, didn't see me and didn't even feel me.

After a while of trying to convince myself that it was just a bad dream, I started thinking more and more about what the man said.

And what he did.

If I understood correctly, if I made another person see the image he AirDropped me, the cabin would show up to them just like it did to me, and once they entered I'd be able to go back to... the world I came from.

Back to the present, it's only been a day since I fell into the rabbit hole of this and I already feel like I'm going insane. I can't do this for much longer.

I also don't want to sacrifice another person just so I can be free, so I came up with a plan. I ain't sure if it's going to work, I still don't understand how this all is happening, but it's worth a try. I need to do it before my phone runs out of battery.

I still have the image the guy sent me. I need to post it online, but with a guarantee that a lot of people will see it. My social media are not even an option, because I don't, under any circumstances, want the people close to me to see it. I'm not putting them through this. I'll rather choose a million strangers.

Now listen, technically, if thousands of people kept seeing it, it would mean that nobody would stay here long enough. Right? If I'm correct, it would create a loop, and the people would just keep switching.

I know exactly where to post it. I'd already written it all down, so the people reading it will know what's going on once they get here. I added an image link of the spiral to the article- and cropped myself out so I won't end up being blamed by the internet.

My data are turned on, connecting me to the internet and now, only one button is dividing me from freedom - "**Post to** r/nosleep".

If you're still reading, I'm sorry. I lied that there is no escaping. I needed you to get this far.

Good luck.
