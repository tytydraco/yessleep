Hey y'all, the name's kinkyboy(atleast on this side of my life) and i really need help from some of you guys.... 

I was walking through my town in Japan at about 9 o clock in the morning, and i was high as hell. The previous night, I hadn't slept a wink because my parents weren't home.... But my girlfriend was. We ended up smoking a whole pack together and were extremely unpresentable. I remember everything being wonky as hell and feeling like I was in some mirror dimension. But today morning, I had to walk my girlfriend home, which is exactly what I did. After that i decided to take a stroll around town, go visit all the parts I'd been to sober to visit previously. 


Our town had 2 sides, one side was relatively normal with nothing out of place, a normal town with a school, hospital, and anything else a normal town would have. Well, that was the North side. The South side was a whole other story, it was under the control of Yaa-sans(Yakuzas) and was basically a harbour for every and any kind of illegal activity you could think of(in fact, this was the area I went to yesterday to buy cigarettes and condoms). As I was walking I suddenly realised I'd have to buy some sort of scent to help rid my house from the stink of nicotine. As though the world read my mind, right there on my left  was a yard sale. Now firstly, this is probably the first time I'd ever seen a yard sale in Japan, secondly, I was high as fuck, so going anywhere was probably a bad idea.... 


But well, as a teenager all I do is make bad decisions. I walked towards the yard and as I stepped onto the premises of the sale I started getting a little dizzier. I felt as though I was walking on water, or some other jelly-like wet substance. And before I knew what had happened I was walking home with something in a bag(the candles), and my head still dizzy. Now this is the part where things became weird. As I entered my house and took the candles out of the bag I noticed that they were colored pure black. Now I don't know about the rest of y'all but I ain't never seen no pure black candles before, I mean, even the wick was black. For some reason, I started laughing. For some reason, I was losing my shit just looking at this candle. For some reason, I just kept laughing at the candle in my hand. 


That was all I remembered before I woke up right now. I looked at the time(12pm) and realises id slept for about 3 hours, and my room still smelled of nicotine. With a slight headache now, I reached for the candles at my side and lit them up. One in every corner of my room. Conveniently enough, I only had four candles in my bag, so I had used all the candles.  I then decided to leave my room while it clears up of nicotine smell and go to my balcony where I once again, proceeded to smoke a cigarette, the last one I had in my stash at that.  I proceeded to check my phone and saw a text from my parents saying they'd be a little late, I sighed in relief as this meant I'd have more time to clear up the house while they were gone. After finishing my cigg, I decided to go back into my room and what I saw there was absolutely horrifying. 


In the middle of my room, a smoke bubble had formed, and in the smoke bubble were images of some sort. I slammed the door shut as I walked out of the room and realised I must still be high. That's when out of the corner of my eye I noticed a thin sheet of paper attached to the bag in which I had kept the candles. This is what it read-

Rules to summon [REDACTED] 


1) Place the candles given to you in the four corners of the room where you wish to summon [REDACTED]


2) Leave the room and shut the door while [REDACTED] takes it's form. 


3) After exactly 27 minutes, [REDACTED] will appear through a cloud of smoke which should be formed in the middle of the room vide said candles. 


4) You now have another 13 minutes to wait while [REDACTED] climbs it's way out of the smoke cloud. 


5) Once [REDACTED] has formed, be sure to spray salt on the area surrounding it and chant the following-

. ;'";'-+_!? *.;'=°^•`×=°×`°"*+.,., _-".*':--&_+©®°$=€π√|℅€\®¶]°∆¶`℅¥^~×९Ϭ५Ӡ+%𝟠⊘Ƽ𝟙Ӡ/ {¢™~÷©™®{¥×π^! '


6) After completion of the above instructions, you shall have very successfully summoned [REDACTED]


7) Congratulations on full control of your very own underworld assasin! Do be aware though, you must order the death of one person every 12 hours, else the assasin will come for you instead. 




And that's where it ends, suddenly I heard some noise coming from my room, quickly, I rushed to get table salt. This was a time for acting, not thinking. I've read enough of those stories to know what happens if I don't follow the rules. To all those who mysteriously die in the next 70 odd years or till whenever I can get rid of this thing, I apologise. And as for the help I need, I'm gonna need the names of anyone and everyone you'd like me to kill. Preferably at least 730 names so that it lasts me a year.... I really don't want to die.
