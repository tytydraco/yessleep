The old woman flailed in the snow, like a fish upon the deck of my grandfather’s boat, and I watched her.  She did not cry out.  The neurons for speech had degenerated long before I began working there.  At the time, I felt nothing, save for the fascination that a human being, reduced to its most primal end state, was so much like a fish.  What beauty there was in her movements.  It was nearly holy.

“Meredith!”  A voice from the hallway.  My reverie broken.

“Judith got out, I’m sorry, she got out!”  Fear gripped me.  Fear of interruption.  Fear of the administrative consequence of my transgression.  Fear that God’s revelation, as presented, would be taken away.  Fear since I had been working in this nursing home for less than a week, my first job after graduation.  Fear that nurses eat their young, and I was young at the time.

“Call a code, get out of the way.” Linda, the charge nurse, pushed me aside.  She erupted through the door which had been, but seconds ago, my viewing lens, my glimpse into true reality, devoid of corruption.  Her knees sank into trampled powder beside the dying old woman, Judith. 

“Call 911,” Linda said.

Carl, the janitor, had witnessed Linda’s bolt through the door.  He propped his push broom against the wall and waddled to me in the way of older men whose youth was dominated by manual labor.

“What happened?” he had asked.

“I…she got out…” The panic of youth, of inexperience had stolen my words.  To be so transfixed, to be forced into the transition of the abstraction of creation, to the concrete of this place jarred me.  

He ran to the emergency phone.

“Meredith, did you call a code?!” 

“No…not...no.”  What was the procedure to call a code?  My training consisted of the instructions, yet I retained none of it.  A failure on my part, truly shameful.  Procedures are in place to not only be followed, but learned.  I did neither.  One may be forgivable, given the circumstances, however not both.    

“Get out here!  Stay with her.  Let her seize, keep her airway clear, I’ll be right back.” 

I succumbed to Linda’s coax.  I kneeled beside the shaking husk of what once was a woman.  Linda departed.

Judith.  Her name was Judith.  Her child had visited this afternoon, at the beginning of my shift.  An uncouth man.  I was told he visited weekly, checking on his deposit.  A planter of litter inside this facility of debris.  She did not know him today.  He left flowers in her room, they smelled of grocery store dough.  He had hugged her when he left.  She had stared with vacant eyes as I took a blood sample from her.  What sins did she commit to be abandoned in this place?  Or for her own self to abandon her body?  Perhaps he was the original sinner, and she was merely part of his debt.

Her arms folded to her chest, palms facing her shoulders.  Decerebrate posturing.  I had only seen it in school.  There would be no need for a clear airway now.  Her soul, if she had one still, or ever, would soon be vacant.

“What do you see?” I asked softly, a secret between only us.

Spittle bubbled from the corners of her blue tinged lips.  Perhaps lack of oxygen, perhaps the cold.  Perhaps both.  Her eyes fluttered half open, jaundiced yellow sclera all that was visible.

“Get out of the way, Meredith!”  Linda again, Lisa and Toni too.  I complied with the request.  What sins would they judge me for?  There was a bench nearby, and I sat on its ice-covered slats.  

The paramedics arrived, the rhythmic chest compression matching my own beating heart.  The buzz of an AED, the electric current coursed through Judith’s veins into my own.  Revelation.  Jubilation.  She was meeting God.  I wept with the joy of a minor prophet receiving a syllable of the Holy Word.

I shivered as they collected her.  Stretcher wheels skidding, locked with snow as paramedics and firemen pushed her through the courtyard and into the building.  God went with her, and I remained.

A spectre, dark and cold as the night, sat beside me on the bench.

“What the hell are you doing?” Linda.  Her teeth reflected the glint of the courtyard security light.  Her skin was smooth, pale.  For a woman proclaiming to be in her late 30s, she showed none of the markers.  No laugh lines, no blemishes, no deposits of foundation common among her generation. 

“I’m sorry…” all I could muster.

“How long were you standing there?!  I know you’re new, but that isn’t an excuse.  Go back to your rounds.  We’re gonna have a come to Jesus before the end of shift.”  She left.  Bleach and rotten kelp lingered in her wake.

Carl was scooping shovels full of stained snow into a biohazard bag.  

“I’m sorry,” I whispered as I passed him, for I was sorry.

“First time is rough, and that’s OK.  Never let it get easy.  You ain’t a freakin’ monster, girl.”  He spoke in the non-rhotic way of the south of the city.  

“Thank you, Carl.” I said.

Upon entry to the door, I saw the blinking red light.  Small, perched between near the wall and the ceiling of the hallway.  A security camera, its field of view the entryway to the courtyard.  I looked at the lens, a squid eye judging, threatening, transmitting its witness of the old woman’s escape, my pursuit, and my halt at the barrier to the outside world.

True unconditional fear gripped me.  Though I have known fear in the years since, absolute terror in fact, perhaps no fear was greater than watching my inert accuser in that South Boston nursing home.  My license would be revoked.  Investigations.  Destitution.  Civil or criminal penalties.  Four years of school jettisoned by five minutes of fascination.

The women’s restroom had a lock.  A single stall, a trash can, a sink.  There was no mirror to inspect my face.  I still wore mascara in public then, the darkness of its seep visible to me in my peripheral vision.  My flip phone provided little usable reflection, and my compact mirror was in my bag at the nurses’ station.  I dabbed with wet paper towels, perhaps too many, perhaps too long, but water is a cleanser.  Water soothes.  Water is holy.  

Clear the mechanism.

The security recording system was located in Linda’s office.   Then, I did not know it was uncommon for a charge nurse to have a private office.  Linda occupy herself in her office several times per shift, presumably to do paperwork, and likely swap out tapes the VHS tapes, for this was a time before digital.  

 My rounds needed conclusion, however Linda had her own tasks to complete.  If Judith had perished, there would be a need to collect her items for delivery to her child.  Night shift was short staffed.  The residents would be agitated by the commotion of one of their own being set free.  There was time to enact my plan without fear of discovery.

Linda’s office was located behind the nursing station.  Derelict.  Voices from a room down the hall, confused residents.  Linda would be upset with my absence.  No matter.  My time of employment was nearly finished here.  Some actions, when taken early, stain the reputation so long, so thoroughly, their mark casts a shadow.  Tonight was one such.  The nursing community was insular in the area, though not small.  Reputations could be jettisoned or ignored.  Further employment at a place like this, even if exemplary, would itself become a blemish on a career’s trajectory.  

The door opened smoothly to a darkened room, lit only by the glow of a computer monitor, and the several television screens.  Filing cabinets, posters, a battered metal desk with two mismatched chairs facing.  Linda’s chair sighed as I deposited my weight upon it.  Her desk a testimony of disorganization, knick-knacks, empty mugs filled with pencils.  

Beside the desk, a separate shelf was built into the wall.  Five monitors atop five VCRs upon the shelf, zip-tied wires leading to a central AV input selector, wires again splitting, and worming into the wall.  One monitor shows the nurses’ station and main entrance, another, the entrance to the med room, the other three the ingress and egress points within the building.  

I pressed the STOP button on the VCR beneath the monitor for the courtyard, then pressed rewind.  Though it would easiest to simply remove the tape, I discarded the idea.  The footage would need to be erased, lending credence to a story of technical malfunction.  The tape rewound, motors spinning slowly at first, counter numbers running backward. 

I have always been a curious individual.  As some find solace in the intake of alcohol, so thus is my desire for novelty.  In the years since, much as the liquor has for many, novelty has lead me down a lonely path, consuming me, altering in ways unrecognizable to the young woman sitting in that borrowed seat.  Much as the drunkard outwardly regrets their choices, internally they are beholden to a greater power over them.  Sorcery perhaps, though I consider it a form of heresy.  But I digress.  

My attention was first drawn to an 8x10 framed painting atop Linda’s desk.  It was of a caucasian male, permed black hair wildly voluminous, rounded into a dark halo.  Smokey glasses covered his pale pale skin.  He wore a bolo tie atop a black button shirt tucked into black slacks held by a large golden license plate belt.  On his back, he wore a high collared cape, black on the outside, red within.  A heart symbol in red Sharpie around the word *Phantom*, scrawled to the man’s side.  Perhaps her husband, or boyfriend, though I had never witnessed Linda wear a ring, or speak of a man.

The majority of the desk drawers held nothing of significance, and nothing I will report here.  However, the small cooler nestled underneath the desk bewildered me.  Inside were four one-liter packets of blood.  I made a mental note.  Mishandling and incorrect storage of biohazardous waste is reportable to the Board of Nursing, and I would be doing so upon my resignation, if they chose to level undue harm.

The tape had rewound approximately twenty minutes in the past, I stopped its rearward progress and pressed PLAY.  I saw myself standing in the doorway, gazing at the camera.  I stopped the tape, and continued to rewind.  

Voices from behind the door.  I glanced at the security feed from the nurse’s station immediately outside.  Someone was there.  Black scrubs and a beanie, their back to the camera.  I couldn’t see who it was, however, their face and hair were obscured by the camera's angle.  Likely not Linda.

I pressed PLAY.

I watched myself stand in front of the door to the courtyard.  My jaw slackened, my hand pressed to glass.  Enraptured.  The early years of adulthood, when the incubated habits of the child thrash into the stupidity of adolescence, are the last unique time in someone’s life.  Their humanity has yet to be determined, for youth are truly not people, merely engines combusting sensation and exhausting hubris.  Humanity comes later, when veins appear on the hands, as has been said by more eloquent individuals than myself.

On the screen a pair a set of black scrubs walked into view.  Propelled by an unseen force, I stumbled aside, and the door opened, the scrubs walking through the door.  I cocked my head.  A habit from childhood.  I remember being shoved by Linda, yet she did appear on camera.  The red ponytail did not swing, for it was not there, her tattooed hands made no contact with me.  An empty suit of polyester clothing, walking on its own.  

“What are you doing?”  Harsh tone, accusation in the question, from the open office door.  

“Linda, hi, I’m sorry, I, um, wanted to, to talk to you,” I said, the unlubricated words struggling to escape my teeth.

“Why are you in my office, Meredith?  Why are you at my desk?”  She walked slowly, quietly, no steps upon the old linoleum floor.  A smoothness of gait uncanny, as if she floated.

“I don’t think I can do this job.  I appreciate you guys for taking a chance on me, but, I’m so sorry…I’m gonna quit,” I said.  

“You are a sucky nurse.  Now, answer me hon, why are you at my desk?”  Her tone changed.  Gone was the confrontation, replaced by welcome, by comfort.  Like a gentle surf heard through a window.

Her top lip was red against her pale, freckled, wrinkle-less skin.  I recalled her not wearing lipstick earlier.  

“I was trying to figure out what happened.  I feel so bad.  I screwed up, I’m so sorry.”  Nothing I said was untrue, merely the motivations behind my actions and feelings.  I prefer to lie, if necessary, only through omission, but this was before I had set such rules for myself.

Linda stood over me.  She was tall for a woman.  Tall for a man.  Even when standing she could leer over the top of my head, but seated as I was, I strained to keep eye contact with her.  My neck exposed.

She placed a long finger on my nose, gently holding it.

“Little thing, what the fuck are you doing in my cooler?”  She smiled as she whispered, her red stained teeth were sharper than I had seen before, like jagged glass in a broken window.

“I don’t know, I swear I didn’t touch anything, I was just watching the tape.” 

A cold hand rested on my shoulder, gripping my collar bone.  Her fingers kneading in comfort and safety.  I wanted to lay my head upon that hand, to pin my ear against it, and listen to its song of tendons and bone.

On the screen, an empty set of scrubs burst through the door and ran off camera.

“Little thing, when did you figure it out?” Linda said, her voice was deeper, softer, her accent gone, something irresistible and unstoppable.  It called to me.

“I, I don’t, I didn’t, I want to go home, I’m sorry,” I said.  Confusion had replaced my usually analytical mind.  I did not understand the new set of inputs.  The algebraic equation so devoid of numeric factors, it had been reduced to a line of poetry.

Linda gripped my other shoulder, and leaned down, drawing my face toward hers.  She smelled of copper and the sea.  Her jagged teeth, longer now, shined with red-dyed saliva.  I saw myself reflected in them.  Witness to my confusion, churning with a longing that was not my own.  But, I did not see God within her mouth.

“It’s true.  Nurses eat their young, little thing.”

Clear the mechanism.

My forehead made sudden and violent contact with her chin.  My father was a Boston cop, and had taught me from an early age to never wait for violence to be visited upon you.  I saw stars twinkling in overlay as Linda’s head snapped back.  I punched her stomach, it gave little under my fist.  She pulled me from the chair, dragging me down as she fell.  

I landed on top of her, and tried to drive my fist into her kidney.  Pain burned through my face, as her fist made contact with my orbital bone, and I was knocked down, my head hitting the side of the desk.  The world began to fade, but a new sensation of pain kept me conscious as something pulled my hair, pinning my ear to my shoulder, exposing my neck.

In desperation, I flailed with my fists, making contact with something sharp and jagged, I wrenched my head away, hair ripping in a bloody clump.  I tucked my chin and smashed my bodyweight against Linda, driving her into the near wall, feeling the give of drywall through her.

Fists pounded my side, I felt something hard shatter inside me.  I would learn later it was two ribs, uncleanly broken.  Breath escaped my lungs and drawing new air in became difficult.  I struck with my fist toward her face, but she dodged, and my hand smashed through drywall and shattered against a 2x4 stud.  Something crashed to the side.  I saw the television shelf collapse, landing in Linda’s lap.  A TV landed beside her.  I drove an elbow in her face before she could fully remove the shelf that had entangled her hands.  She reeled, black ooze spilling from her nose.  In desperation I grabbed the TV, held it high, and brought its glass screen over her head.  

Pain, and the smell of burning hair and boiling motor oil was the last sensation I had before the darkness took me.

My mother and father were sitting beside one another when I awoke in a hospital room.  He was a detective by then and was wearing his usual tweed sportscoat.  My mother was in her house dress.  It hurt to breath.  To move.

“Meredith, oh, you’re awake!” she had lamented.  My father held my bruised hand and wept.

I, too, wept.  For that was the day I had seen God, but also His divine absence.
