The space around us has changed again. To be honest it doesn't even really look like a warehouse anymore. The walls have been consumed by thick black nothingness and the racking that’s left has bowed and bent under an invisible force. 

The air thick with rust and decay. 

And the floor is falling away little by little.

So there we sat, under the weak glow of a screen. I tried looking over the edge of the large hole that opened up where the kitchen used to be. 

I wish I hadn't. 

Piles upon piles of rotten flesh met my gaze. When I had finally managed to hold the laptop low enough for the light to reach a little ways down. Discarded remains, some bloated; splashes of yellow and deep purple littering stretched skin, others merely a pile of bones, met my horrified stare. 

The shock of it all nearly cost us our only light source. I had retched over the side of the pit for at least twenty minutes. But there was nothing left to expel. 

The worst part about it all was that the pit was a deep cavernous hole. Yet, despite this, the sorrowful gaze of lifeless eyes were but a few metres below the lip of the gaping abyss. A grotesque display of loss, mounted atop each other in heaps. 

Their arms outstretched, stiff and contorted in different directions, as if they had tried to claw their way out from under a grave made of flesh and bone. 

One face in particular sent a harrowing coldness through my body. Awash with grief I begged Natalie not to look when she shuffled weakly over to me, attempting to pry me from the side of the pit. 

A child, no older than ten was strewn between the bodies, her decaying features staring up directly into my very soul. How fucking terrifed she must have been. Her flesh in places was still almost fresh, hanging onto young bones, cursed to never age. 

She had been stuck here, most likely alone, recently. 

I cried for hours. for us, for the little girl with green eyes and the bodies that lay beneath her. 

Natalie had been growing weaker by the minute. 

Often forgetting things and growing confused. 

Her skin was like ice to touch, yet sweat dripped profusely from her. I should have known it was a bad omen for the horror that was to come. 

We had sat mostly in silence. Nat had been too weak to keep up much conversation as we laid beside each other on the cold unforgiving floor,  hoping to find some comfort. 

“Will you tell me something?” She whispered “anything at all. I hate the silence” 

I had obliged, recounting some of our own fond memories and when I ran out of those I pressed on. Telling her about my childhood, reminiscing times that brought me joy. The family that I missed and would likely never see again. A gentle hand had come to press softly on my cheek as I did so “You’re crying” she said, all matter of fact, a small smile on her lips “You speak of things that hurt you, to bring me comfort. Your a good person Tyler, you didn't deserve this” 

“Neither did you” I mumbled back. 

Natalie had fallen into a restless sleep after that, pain tugging at her brow until it sat creased on her forehead. 

A few days ago, to my utmost horror, I noticed something bulging from cold skin. When Natalie had shifted in her sleep and her top rode up enough to expose her stomach, there was something growing from within her. A putrid sack sprouting  from the left side of Natalie’s abdomen. 

It started off quite small but as time continued to pass us by it had only grown in size. 

It didn't take long until it hung from her, bulbous and straining against delicate flesh. So large in its form, she quickly lost the ability to move as it pulsed and unjellated, pinning her to the floor. Writhing in pain. 

I held Natalie's hand as tears silently cascaded down her cheeks. A confused look had passed over her face, hand coming to shakily rest on her lower abdomen just beside the sack that rippled periodically. I watched on with baited breath. 

My whole body began to shake then, knees feeling weak as they struggled to keep me upright in my kneeling position beside her. Every instinct in me told me to run at that moment but the love I had for Natalie kept me glued to the spot, my eyes trained on her beside me, fingers interlocked. 

We both gasped when something began to swell and push against the thin layer of skin that kept the sack in place. She clutched at it in disbelief. 

The slow and groggy demeanour Natalie had adopted the longer that thing had syphoned the life from her was replaced by a weak but frantic energy. Fear exuded from her in waves. 

I squeezed at her hand as she called out to me through clenched teeth. 

“Please, help me. Get it out!” 

Desperate fingers clawed at the floor as the mass expanded even more. A puddle of blood pooling around us as the skin began to tear. 

“Fuck! It-it’ll be okay… I-” 

It was all lies, and the words burned on my tongue as it spewed between my lips, forcing me to choke on my own falsehood. 

I couldn't breathe, my heart beating frantically against my rib cage as I shirked off my top and pressed it uselessly against the gargantuan tear that only continued to spread.

I watched hopelessly as the girl before me writhed in pain, her back arching against the cold unforgiving floor. She wailed as the skin stretched and contorted around the foreign mass, the outline of hands pushing up against the sack had me recoiling,  eyes the size of saucers as I gazed at my friend unwillingly giving birth to the things that steals faces. 

My hands hovered uselessly in the space between us, body trembling. The stench of death caught in my throat. 

A continuous soundscape of pain and terror permeated the air around us. I could hear the strain of Natalie’s vocal cords, as the thing within her pushed against flesh once again, with more ferocity. I didn't want to look but my eyes were transfixed on her bloated form as she squirmed on the wet ground.

“I don’t want to die! Please! Tyler help me”  

She begged for me to save her, and yet, there was nothing I could do. 

My heart shattered into fine dust, blowing away leaving me just an empty pit of despair. Not unlike the space we had been left to rot in.

I am ashamed to admit that the grotesque display before me had frozen me in place. 

Her anguish reaching a desperate crescendo that reverberated around my skull. 

And then Natalie's pleas began to peter off, the last of her energy used. form now slumped bonelessly against the blood sodden ground. My vision blurred with unshed tears.  

I called out to her, hand reaching forward until the sack all but burst open. 

Long and thin fingers curled around the flayed flaps of skin. I watched it begin to pull itself free, its stiff and aborted movements pushing yellowish puss from deep within the growth. Landing with a sickening slap against the ground, Now merely just discarded offal. It seemed to almost unfold itself from within her, shoulders popping out into place, its slender and malnourished form curling its spine as it dragged itself free. The thing was completely drenched in her blood, its thin dark hair flattened against its misshapen head. 

It stared at me for a few moments before clambering over itself and scuttling away into the darkness. 

And I was left alone. The corpse of my friend staring back at me through unseeing eyes. 

I didn't move for a long time, bulging eyes transfixed on Natalie who was swimming in her own blood. She died with terror painted across her features and even in death she did not look at peace. 

I didn't cry. 

I don’t really know if that's because I was in shock or because I had nothing left to give. 

Even when the warm red ocean beneath her seeped into the fabric of my jeans and grew cold in the frigid air. I continued to sit there. She had begun to forget herself towards the end and then that thing grew out of her like a sickness. Like she was just part of some fucked up reproductive system for these things to infest the real world and now that Natalies body had produced a new one. I'm sure it will watch me, will do whatever it did to Natalie up in that box and the same fate will meet me. 

I keep going over the days leading up to being stuck here. If the thing that wore Natalie’s skin did anything strange to me that ended up becoming the catalyst to ending up here. 

Is it just this building? Are there more places out there that have been infected by whatever these things are and how do they have the power to manipulate an entire area? I wish I had a way of answering these questions. It kills me to know that nothing I say or do will prevent this shit from happening again. 

I don’t wish this fate on anyone. I hope everyone out there reading this will continue to have a normal life and will never be exposed to whatever the fuck this is. 

I thought long and hard about pushing Natalie’s body into the pit, I couldn't look at her like that anymore… But in the end I wasn't able to bring myself to do that to her, she deserved a proper burial, but that wasn't something I could provide her here. So instead I laid my discarded top over her face and I said a few words to a person who would never get to hear them. 

Now I sit here, waiting for death. 

There’s nothing more to do.
