[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dlb2en/i_was_trapped_in_a_pitch_black_room_it_turned_out/)

My head, which had previously only been wrapped in a thin bandage, now felt tighter. I knew it was mainly because the new bandage was tighter and thicker, but it also felt tight because it wanted to break open and release something.

I got used to my new surroundings more quickly this time. I was back in a hospital-like room. I knew it wasn’t the same room Reeve had rescued me from, because the furnishings were completely different, and the room also seemed much bigger. There were no surgical equipment lying around or IV bags hanging anywhere. The walls were more attractive, though, because they were painted in pastel colors. There was even a TV hanging from the ceiling. 

What I found even more strange was that I wasn’t strapped to the hospital bed. I assumed this was a recovery room. Was I in a real hospital, far away from the dungeon building?

I got up from the bed and put one foot on the floor, hoping my head wouldn’t give up on me again. I put the other foot down and stood upright. It felt liberating. 

I stroked the bandage on my head. It really had many layers. I wondered if the bullet was still lodged in my skull or if someone was able to get it out.

I heard footsteps in the background. I was still conflicted about my current situation, so I didn’t know how to react to the person coming. Should I lie down in bed and hope I wouldn’t be tied up after all? Should I prepare for an attack to escape from here?

Just as the handle was pushed down, I grabbed the TV remote from the nightstand in a matter of seconds so I would at least have some kind of weapon.

The door flew open. It wasn’t another hazmat suit guy. It wasn’t a nurse or doctors with gas masks either. It took me a moment to recognize the green-grayish eyes under the brunette curls. It was Flo. 

I dropped the remote and ran towards her. I didn’t care how desperate I felt. I wrapped my arms around her and buried my head in her neck. It wasn’t long before she hugged me too and stroked my back, like she always did.

At some point I pulled away and looked at her more intensely. She definitely looked different. Where there had once been a flawless and happy face, there was now a shadowy and dissolved mask. I say mask because Flo had never put on a face like that before. She didn’t smile at all. It didn’t suit her. But at the same time I didn’t care very much because the certainty that she was alive was more important than anything else to me. 

“I missed you so much”, I said, gently holding her head in my hands. 

“Me too”, she whispered. Her expression remained emotionless.

Flo took my hands from her face and slowly led me to my bed. 

“You should rest. Your head is still suffering from the shot.”

I sat down on the bed, but she stayed standing and crossed her arms. I didn’t quite understand what was going on with her. I had the feeling she was distancing herself from me.

“How are you?” I asked after a short silence. 

“I’ve been feeling better. I wasn’t entirely happy when they contacted me to come back, but I couldn’t say no either, right?”

“Who are ‘they’?” I asked, confused.

“The people who run this place, who else?” She seemed a little annoyed.

“Are you safe, Flo?” 

“They keep telling me that. But I won’t believe it until I’m dead.” 

There was silence again. Her tone and what she said didn’t lift my mood in the slightest. It just made me more depressed, and I could feel my head pounding again. Flo must’ve noticed.

“Shall I get you a glass of water?”

She was already on her way out, but I held onto her arm. It hurt my soul to grab her like that, but I needed more certainty about what was going on. 

“Flo, please tell me what’s going on here. I don’t know anything except that I woke up in a dark dungeon with no memory of how I ended up there. I was attacked left and right by people in hazmat suits. I was shot. I learned about a pandemic of tentacle monsters that took possession of me. I saw Benny being tortured by that monster…”

I stopped in the middle of my tirade. Only now did I realize that only Flo was by my side. But Benny was in this building as well. He was also one of those anomalies. Judging by the look on Flo’s face, she probably knows best about Benny’s whereabouts.

“Where is he, Flo?”

Tears streamed down her face. They turned black due to the makeup.

“Benny didn’t make it. His anomaly level was his death sentence. It was too late. The monster killed him. I tried everything to get out of there and save him, but the situation was probably at its worst four weeks ago.”

Four weeks ago? I’d been trapped here for that long?

I quickly dismissed that thought. I pulled Flo to the bed, and she didn’t refuse. I held her tightly against me and she cried on my shoulder. She made no effort to hold herself onto me. Her body just hung limply against me. She looked so broken, so lost. I knew exactly what she was going through. Too well. 

We stayed in that position for a while. During that time, I remembered Benny, imagined what he was like when all this cruelty hadn’t happened yet, and he was just living his life. I still remember how much he loved skateboarding and how I always gave him a push with my rollerblades. How we went out for ice cream together. How much time we spent playing Mario Kart. I’m sure he would’ve got along really well with my brother Charlie. Even with Reeve. 

Eventually, Flo was strong enough to lift her head from my shoulder and wipe her eyes. 

“What happens now?” I asked carefully.

“What do you mean?”

“Will I be able to get out soon?”

“It’s not that easy. You have a very high anomaly level. They’ll probably keep you here for some time.” 

I was expecting this answer. I remembered the training video I’d seen with Reeve. I was level 55 and anyone with level 50 or higher would be the first to go. 

I hesitated before asking another question.

“Then why are you here?”

Flo took my hand. “I want to help you so you can see what this creature is doing to you. Before you were shot, you were seen having a seizure. That’s a common symptom that the creature is active and gaining access to your brain.” 

“Did Reeve tell you that? Did he tell you that he saw it? Where is Reeve anyway?” I was completely perplexed by everything at that moment. My thoughts were drifting in every direction. 

“I don’t know Reeve. A guard saw everything.” 

“And how do you know everything?” I freed myself from her hand.

“They told me everything while I was here. I was only level 0, so I was no threat. Believe me, I know more than you.”

“If you knew more than me, you would also know that they don’t just keep everyone above level 50 here for further experiments. They kill you. Do you understand? Benny was killed by *them*.”

Even though I sounded louder and more threatening now, Flo stayed by my side. She now grabbed my head and tried to calm me down. 

“Please, honey. You’ll get out of here in no time, if you just play along.”

I stared deep into her eyes. I kept making sure they were the same eyes I’d fallen in love with in high school. I wanted to believe Flo. I really wanted to confide in her. After everything she’d been through, I didn’t want to make her feel even more insecure. I certainly didn’t want to lose her again. I managed to calm myself down.

“Okay. What exactly should I do?”

“Let the creature get to you. If you feel like your head is about to explode, don’t fight it.”

In fact, I could feel the throbbing more strongly than before. I tried to keep concentrating on Flo’s words, but that would only make me fight the pain. I didn’t want to suffer this torment any longer, let alone more intensely than before. But I did my best. 

As I relaxed all my senses, the thing pressed against my skull like a boxing glove against a punching bag. It was about to spring and break free at any moment. I looked into a blinding white light. It seemed more threatening than the pitch-black darkness.

The light grew fainter, and I saw the outline of a person. It was like just before the gun shot. I did not delve into the memory of the diner. I was much further back. Back to a time when I was younger. It hurt my heart to find myself where Charlie was. 

His outline became clearer and there he was. Grinning happily, holding a cup of coke. I surveyed my new surroundings. I also held a cup of coke in one hand, in the other I held a steering wheel. We were driving along a deserted country road. The sun was setting on the horizon. As the outlines became sharper, my senses also came back to normal, and I was hearing music. ‘Pump It’ by the Black Eyed Peas was playing at full volume and I heard myself and Charlie singing along.

It was strange, but I couldn’t control myself. It was like my current mind was trapped in my old body and I was just observing everything secondhand. It was creepy, but fascinating at the same time.

I remembered that day very well. How could I ever forget it. We had just come from Burger King and were. Now on our way home. I knew Mom would give me hell for getting home so late. Dad wouldn’t like it that I had borrowed his Bentley without asking him.

“Look, Charlie, there’s a forest”, I heard myself say. 

“So what?” Charlie kept slurping his drink.

“I’ve never seen it here before.”

“You were never even driving on this road either.”

I heard myself laughing. I saw myself leaving the country road and turning into a pull-in that bordered the forest.

I was confused. This didn’t seem familiar to me anymore. I always assumed we had continued driving. I didn’t even know there was a forest near the road.

I was getting out, Charlie staying close behind me.

“It’s getting dark, can’t we just go home?”

“You really want to miss a little walk in the forest? Boring.” 

As I continued to mock him, I was going deeper and deeper into the forest. Charlie was following me but keeping my distance. I wanted to shout to him not to be afraid, but I couldn’t.

The forest seemed pretty normal, except that the trees did not differ in any way. They all looked exactly the same. I also felt like the ground was moving. I thought I had drunk a little too much that day, but I’m very sure that I’d never driven drunk in my life. And certainly not with Charlie in the car. 

I was approaching the liquid-looking forest ground, which was surrounded by the identical-looking trees, and was leaning over. It seemed like an optical illusion. I had never seen anything like it before. I was about to put one foot in it when I was suddenly slipping on something and falling in with my whole body. Charlie was calling my name in the background.

I was immediately standing up again. I was sniffing moss out of my nose and brushing the dirt and plants off my body. Charlie was coming running and helping me brush myself clean.

When I looked again, I saw that the trees looked normal and different. The forest ground was no longer moving either. So, it was just my weird mind after all.

On the way back to the car, I was explaining to Charlie what I had seen. He must’ve thought I was crazy because he had only seen a normal forest, which assured me that I was just me.

We were driving back onto the country road. It had now become dark. The road was still empty. There was a strange atmosphere in the car. Charlie was sitting calmly in the passenger seat, but I was getting somehow tense. My whole body was shaking, and my hand were acting up. I couldn’t hold the steering wheel properly. My fingers were fiddling with the music and turning the volume up. It seemed as if I was trying to distract myself. It was disturbing to watch myself like that.

Charlie noticed that too and became suspicious. 

“Watch the road!”

But my eyes were no longer on the road. My mouth was vibrating. My eyes were also moving erratically. Before I knew it, I was vomiting up a substance that I couldn’t identify at first glance. But then it dawned me. They were tentacle arms. Then they sprouted from my eyes, and I could no longer see anything. 

Again, a blinding white light came and this time I played several memories one after the other for brief moments. 

Next, I saw myself squeezing out of the wreckage of my dad’s Bentley. I was spitting out blood and I saw the bone sticking out of my wrist. From that point on I remembered everything again. All these years I had assumed that I had simply driven off the road. When I finally getting outside, I looked at the smoking car and saw Charlie still sitting in it. His airbag obscured most of the view, but it was only the sight of the blood splattered around that made me dread it.

Then the light came back and the next moment I saw myself sitting on the curb. Someone was putting a blanket on me. In the background I saw and heard police sirens. I was just sobbing. 

The light again. I saw my parents in out apartment. They were screaming terribly. Their voices sounded scratchy. But the screams weren’t directed at me. They were yelling at each other. It was so loud and chaotic that I couldn’t understand most of it, but I knew what the reason for the argument was. They never forgave themselves for letting Charlie and me drive alone so late at night.

The light again. I was a lot further in the future this time. I was sitting in the diner. In front of me was a cup of coffee and a marble cake. Tears were rolling down my cheeks. I think this was shortly after I dropped out of college, but I wasn’t sure. 

Light. And there we were. My last known memory. The starting point before I woke up in hell. Flo, Benny and I were sitting in the diner slurping chocolate milkshakes together. Benny and I decided to have a drinking contest. I let him win, but the cost was that he was getting brain freeze. Flo was sending him to the bathroom so he could pee. Then she was leaning toward me, looking pretty serious. 

“I think you should slow down.”

“What do you mean?” I asked. I really didn’t know what was happening. This memory was very fragmented.

“I don’t like that you spend so much time with Benny. Whenever the three of us do something, you only hang out with him. And whenever we’re both alone, your first question is always where Benny is. I don’t like that.”

“I don’t understand. I just like spending time with your brother. You always said I was good with kids.”

“But this is different. And you know it." 

My old self shook his head, but I knew what she meant. 

“Benny is not…Charlie. As hard as it sounds, Benny is not your brother.”

I was swallowing hard and becoming more agitated again.

“So, you don’t want me to be by Benny’s side anymore?”

“I think we should take it slow. You have to get over your loss, honey. It’s been three years now.”

I was becoming more and more agitated, and my body was trembling. I was holding back. Benny had just come out of the bathroom and was sitting down with us. 

“Another drinking contest? I bet I’ll be faster again”, Benny said, cheerfully.

“Benny, it’s time to go”, said Flo, getting up. 

Benny seemed confused and refused to go. While the two were arguing, a waitress was coming to our table and asking if we wanted anything else. Everything happened at once and I couldn’t stand the pressure.

My body was shaking harder, eyes and mouth were rebelling and then the tentacle arms were shooting out from all ends and hitting Benny right in the face. Flo, who was only streaked, was frightened and backed away. All the other people in the diner were overwhelmed by the sight of the tentacle arms and were hiding or running outside.

Light. I found myself in a room that resembled a delivery room. Two people in hazmat suits were towering over me and talking to each other.

“And these tentacles have only appeared on him so far?” 

“As far as we know. But the little boy in room 3 is showing signs that suggest he could be next.”

“What do these things do?”

“We can only assume that they do something to the host’s mind. Manipulate it or damage it in some other way. It could also be that they cause hallucinations. Before being admitted, this object here kept babbling about a person called ‘Reeve’.”

Light. I was now at the place where I had woken up for the first time. In the dungeon. I was talking about Charlie, how much I was missing him. I was talking about Flo and Benny. But who was I talking to? I received no answers or any other reaction to what I was saying.

Light. I was standing outside of the dungeon. I was wearing a hazmat suit. In front of me was the young guard I had lured in. he was shaking all over and peeing himself. But instead of closing the door behind him, I was walking up to him, grabbing his head and smashing it into the concrete wall. Next, the concrete floor. It was unbelievable how easily I managed that. He was really skinny.

Light. I was lying in the hospital bed. Strapped down. The sexy nurse was coming at me, ready to attack me. My arm managed to free itself from the leather strap and grab the scissors from the table. Just as the nurse was about to reach for me, I stabbed her in the neck with the scissors.

Light. I was running down the halls, clipboard in hand. I was alone.

Light. A hazmat suit guy caught me watching the video in the projection room. He was holding a gun in his hand and fired. I was the only one he was aiming at.

The shot hit me, and the light flashed white for the last time.

Flo appeared in front of me. I was back in the recovery room. She seemed very excited.

“What did you see?”

I blinked several times to make sure that I was truly back, and that the horror of the last few years was only anchored in my subconsciousness.

“A lot” I said.

“What exactly?”

I didn’t have the strength to tell her everything in detail. It would be a painful experience and I had already experienced it in the worst possible way. Twice. 

So, I had another idea. 

“To sum it up: we have to get out of here”, I said seriously.

Flo jumped back, visibly confused.

“I’m serious, Flo. The creature made it clear to me that we can’t trust these people. We have to get out of here this instant or they’ll kill us.”

I prayed hard that Flo was on my side. She got up from the bed, paced back and forth, and finally stopped.

“Then quick.”

I hopped out of bed and we both left the room. We walked down another maze of hallways and rooms.

“How did you get inside in the first place?” I asked as we wandered the halls, hiding from possible danger. 

“Through an entrance near the administration office. But it’s well secured." 

I followed her every step until we reached a hallway at the end of which two armed guards were guarding a large steel door with barred windows. As soon as the two of them saw us, they pointed their rifles at us.

“How dare you walk around here free?”

Flo stood in front of me. One guard spoke into a walkie-talkie, the other came closer and closer with the rifle and held it close to my face, but not before covering his face in the crook of his arm.

I stared into his angry face. Observed his fake behavior. He thought I was some kind of monster that was contagious. How ironic that he thought I was a monster when it was his people who kept innocent people like me, Flo and Benny imprisoned in dark dungeons and gave them hardly anything to eat. Asshole.

I was seething. But instead of fighting it, I allowed the creature to take possession of me again. In fact, it was much easier for me this time. I opened my mouth and a tentacle shot out. It hit the guard directly in the face and snaked around his neck, squeezing hard and finally letting go when it was clear that he was unconscious. The tentacle immediately aimed for the other guard, who was desperately trying to escape from the building. He had already managed to push the door open, but the tentacle pulled him back into the hallway and strangled him as well. The tentacle rolled back into my mouth and I saw the carnage clearly.

Flo was breathing heavily next to me. She didn’t say a word.

The next moment an alarm went off. There was no time to calm Flo down, so I grabbed her hand and pulled her out of the building. 

I won’t go into detail about what happened up to this point, as it’s not that important. In summary, I can say that we made it out of the building safely and are now in a woodshed near a forest. The owner of the shed was kind enough to take us in until we were ready to leave. He’s currently away. Flo went out a while ago. She said she was going to collect firewood, which I don’t understand, as the owner had stored enough of it. I should check on her later.

I’m glad I made it out of the nightmare. I was free from hell. I don’t know how long my joy will last, but for now I want to enjoy my freedom as much as I can. And I certainly would never have managed it with the help of my savior that was living inside me. It has such a unique power that I can’t explain. 

Of course, I also owe our safe escape to Flo, my other savior.

And not to forget Reeve. I’m looking over to where he’s sitting in an armchair, deep in thought.

Thank you, brother.
