Everyone knew that the Smith brothers would always throw a halloween party on the 30th that led into the morning of the 31st. Around the campus they were known to be the “Gods of Halloween” which made me laugh the first time I saw the school paper with their name on the front page.

**“All are invited to the Halloween Bash, thrown by, you guessed it, The Smith Brothers!”**

*“This has to be a joke..”* I thought. I had nothing else to do, and it said all were invited. Obviously, I was going.

After school that day, I went to a party store that wasn't too far from my house. I picked up a black dress and a headband with cat ears on it. The cat ears weren't coming home with me, I later decided to put them back. I didn't want to be a sexy cat at a Halloween party, there were already going to be hundreds of them.

When the night came around, my friend came to pick me up.

“Hey, are you ready yet?” She barged into my room as I was putting on my eyeshadow.

She was wearing a sexy witch costume with a purple dress. The top had corset details and boning on the bust area. She had a short poofy skirt and webbed stockings with heels. Topped with a witch hat.

“Did my dad let you in?” I said, not looking up from my mirror.

“Yep.” She went to my bed and layed down.

“Wanna hear about this guy I’m talking to? He’s gonna be at the party tonight.”

“Nope.” I reapplied the eyeshadow she made me mess up.

“Why not? You're no fun at all.”

“I don't care about the stupid guy that you're talking to. And I'm just being honest here, he’ll probably dump you at the party.”

“Oh shut up, you don't even know who he is yet”

 I took the lipgloss off the desk and put it on. It was too red. I took it off.

“Oh come on, that looked pretty! Here, I’ll help you.” She took the lipgloss from my hand.

“You don't have to, I got this.” I took the lipgloss back.

“Fiiiine, at least put *some* on.”

We got in her parents' car and drove to the party. It was being held at the twins' house, they had a mini mansion. Their parents were big in business so it made sense why they held such *extravagant* parties. But this was like any other halloween party with alcohol involved. We waved her parents goodbye and walked up the stone pathway covered in halloween decorations up to the doors. Once we got to the steps, we entered through the giant double doors into the mini mansion.

We were met with lights of a billion colors, streamers, party poppers, music, all of the stuff that makes a party a party. Two people opened the doors for us.

“Welcome guys!” One of them said. It was Antony Smith. He was wearing a scarecrow costume and he had a voice changer inside the mask. We didn't know it was him, so we screeched when we saw the costume.

“Come on in! Don't be shy.” The other spoke. He was Harry Smith. He was wearing a ripped up werewolf costume, also with a voice changer. 

They took off the masks and revealed their identities, even though it was plain to see through the disguise.

“Drinks over there, food on the table, make yourselves at home.” Antony said. He took my friend around the waist and kissed her on the forehead.

“HE’S WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO?? How come you never told me?”

“I was scared you’d freak out.”

“Why would I freak out? I’m happy for you!” *I lied.* Him and his brother were absolute *bitches.* They would prank the freshman and scare them around the neighborhood of our small town. His exes would be *happy,* almost *ecstatic,* when they broke up. They’d complain how bad of a partner they were.

“Let's go get some food, alright?” I spoke.

“Yeah you go do that..” she was in an embrace with him. I could almost see her begin to *grind* on him the the beat of the music. Ugh, I felt sorry for her. I knew what was coming. And she knew that I’d be there for her.

I went to get some food from the table, along with some of the drink from the most likely spiked punch bowl. I didn't care at this point. Before I could take a sip, there was a scream. ***The lights went out.***

*“Great, another prank…..Oh come on, what happened to the lights?....What the fuck man?....”*

There was scattered chatter, that's when the lights came back on.

There was commotion in the middle of the large living room.

People were in a circle, I was unfortunately in the front. I could see *everything.*

There was a junior on the floor, she had a skull mask on but she looked to be *struggling* to take it off.

***“What the fuck??”*** I heard someone scream. The skull mask seemed to be *morphing ***into*** her face.* Her skin began to dissolve, leaving only pure *bone.* She went limp. **She was dead.**

***"AHHHHHHHHH!!!”*** Someone else screamed. It was one of the twenty sexy cats at the party. Her headband seemed to disappear. The ears *morphed* into her head, her scalp. She was turning *into* a cat. She began to grow whiskers. Her hands turned to paws, her nose became smaller. Her face and body grew gray hairs with black stripes. She fell to the floor, arching her back, *like a cat.* She ran off into another room, now turned *completely* into a cat. 

Harry screamed next. His face began to morph, bones cracked, his face turned into the werewolves head. His body grew to a gargantuan size, growing gray matted fur. His shirt became more ripped than it was. He turned into a werewolf. He growled and howled out towards the full moon. He then jumped out of the window towards the nearby mountain. Presumably to howl at the moon.

Screams filled the room. People turning ***into*** their costumes.

Antony screamed, I recognized it over the rest. His face became shades of orange and yellow, sprinkled with brown and green specks. A line split open the head, appearing like a mouth. Straw began to appear out of *nowhere,* sprouting from his mouth and sleeves. He was a scarecrow.

More screams filled the house.

I ran out of the house, along with more people, still turning into their costumes. Around fifteen cats ran out of the house, going every which way. I was outright ***terrified.***

I'm *really* glad that I didn't wear a costume this Halloween…
