My girlfriend Kaylin had always been an outdoorsman. She loved to drag me on 10 hour car rides to go camping halfway across the country, only for us to return two days later. There’s things I’d rather do than camping, but I don’t hate it and I want to keep her happy.

“Where should we go for our vacation, Chris?” Said Kaylin.
“I dunno babe. Your choice,” I said, looking absently at my phone. She sighed and said
“Oo, what about North Cascades National Park? I haven’t been there!” She exclaimed. 

I gave a thumbs up and figured the vacation matter was settled. We both would rather go on an international vacation, but as fresh college graduates with lots of debt and not a lot of money, it was pretty impossible. We left a few days later, packing our car with a tent and all the camping gear you could dream of.

“Let’s stop at this inn and see if we can get directions to the sites,” said Kaylin. 

We were pretty lost, and the campsites were nowhere to be found. We got out of the car and walked to the front door of the shabby little hotel. In front of us, there was a group of three people who looked to be friends. One was a guy wearing a bright yellow rain jacket, a girl wearing hiking pants and a light jacket, and another guy just in a t shirt and shorts.

 *cli-clack cli-clack cli-clack cli-clack cli-clack cli-clack*

“Do you guys hear that?” Asked yellow rain jacket guy.
“It’s probably just one of those police officers that rides on a horse or something.” Said the girl, looking down at her phone.

The girl was right. A police officer was coming on a horse. But in the opposite direction. He rode off past the inn and towards the direction the clacking sound came from. A few seconds later, the sound of a horse screaming and a man yelling could be heard. 

Everybody ran to look at why they were yelling. But it came to us first.

A six legged horse. A fucking six legged horse. It was around the height of a regular horse, but it’s true size was it’s torso. A good 15 feet were in between each one of its sets of limbs. How the hell it was able to stand, I’m not sure. It had short white fur, so short it looked almost bald. The only not pale white place on it was it’s black ring of fur coiled around its neck.

It had a look in its beady eyes. You know how most horses just stand there, looking almost sad? This one looked hateful. I know it sounds dumb but it’s the best way to describe it. The scariest part to me was how it left no trace. No footprints, no bodies, no blood. Where the police officer should’ve been, there was nothing except his horse lying dead on the road.

“Oh dude, what the fuck!” Said the guy in shorts. He had his phone out and was recording the whole thing.

Everybody dashed for the door of the inn. I was right beside Kaylin and behind the guy in the yellow rain jacket.

The horse whinnied and barreled towards the guy in the rain jacket. He screamed, and was lying on the gravel. The horse walked over him, his serpentine body barricading me from getting past. We began to run around the horse, trying to get to the inn.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the rain jacket guy laying underneath the horse. The flesh of the horses chest or stomach or whatever ripped apart, and a red light enveloped rain jacket guy. He floated upwards into the ripped flesh, and straight into the horses body. The flesh closed with a squelch and a lump went down the horse, like he was digesting his meal

The horses flesh seemed to ripple and gurgle when the guy was absorbed, eaten, whatever.

“Chris we need to fucking go!!” Kaylin yelled, dragging my arm and leading me inside the hotel. The others from earlier were nowhere to be found.

I hurriedly got inside, and we ran up the stairs and to a room closest to the stairwell and pounded on the door.

“Whozzat? Who’re you?” Said the man who opened the door for us. He was a country boy, and had a beer belly.

“We need to come in,” I said, practically pushing past him.

“Alright, explain,” the man growled. And so we did. Everything that happened. He whistled and laughed once we were done.

“I’ll just say this. Y’all are fucked,” he said, still smiling.

“Wha-“ I tried to blurt out.

“Let me finish. The forester horse is a demon in the truest sense of the word. The tale is like this. A horse was beaten so bad by his owner, he turned bald. The devil came to earth and said to the horse: I’ll free you, but you have to bring me 5 humans each month. I’ll put a portal to hell right on you, and make you look like a snake to represent your connection with hell. And the horse agreed. The tale also says that if you have seen the horses eyes, hell always know where you are,” the man finally finished his tale.

“So what should we do?” Kaylin inquired.

“Wait to die. Nothing else you can do,” said the man.

Right as he said that, a cracking sound came from the floor. The horses head came from the floor and he quickly head butted Kaylin and knocked her to the ground.

I ran. I ran out the window and off the balcony and am now hiding myself as best as possible. I know he will get me. But while I was running out of the room unnoticed something. The country man began to laugh, and two horns grew out of his forehead and his eyes turned to that of a goats.

I’m writing this while laying underneath a bush behind the hotel. I just needed a way to let everyone know what happened today. I hear galloping coming towards me.

Don’t ever see the eyes of the forester horse.
