What I'm about to recount happened to me in late summer 2021, and it's something I haven't been able to stop pondering. It happened back in spring 2020, and it has actually been explained. But the rest... I wonder if I'll ever get any answers to that.

There are really only two things you need to know about me. Firstly, I love hiking in the woods and fields. Without my daily walks, I feel like I'm climbing the walls. I'm no wilderness expert, and it's not about exercise or any kind of digital detox; it's just about being alone in environments where I always feel safe. My daily hiking excursions take place in my local area and rarely last more than a couple of hours, so I don't need to carry a lot of gear. In summer, it's just a water bottle, and maybe a notebook if I spot something interesting.

I never take my phone with me. Occasionally, I do get lost when I decide to try shortcuts and new paths, but never so badly that I can't find my way home. It's not because I have an amazing sense of direction, which I really don't. It's more due to the second fact you need to know about me: I have lived in the same house my whole life. I've been hiking around since I learned to walk. I grew up with a mom who is very interested in nature and local history. She taught me most of what I know about plants, animals, and ecology, as well as how to read traces of past human activity in a landscape. We live in a regular suburban neighborhood somewhere in northern Maryland, not far from the nearest town, but surrounded by several wonderful small wetlands. It's a very old cultural landscape. I can walk to at least two ancient hill forts, even though today they mostly look like broken piles of stones on top of cliffs. On the nearest bog, there are the foundations and well of a soldier's cottage from the 1800s, and the fields and forests around are full of similar traces. Despite walking almost every day, the surroundings never cease to surprise me.

One such surprising experience happened in spring 2020, sometime in April, I believe. I had taken a walk around the valley between the ancient hill forts, which used to be a bay at that time before land uplift turned it into today's farmland. I was almost back at the nearest gravel road when I heard them. The ravens. Ravens are monogamous and often engage in pair flights in spring, but this was not a couple. It wasn't even two couples. Fifteen... Eighteen? I stood there trying to count, completely mesmerized by the spectacle in the sky. At least thirty, thirty-five ravens were soaring high above the edge of the forest where my walking path passed. I say soaring because it was as if they were engaged in a shared, meaningful activity, undulating back and forth like a loosely connected cloud; sometimes sparse, sometimes dense; sometimes slow and languid, suddenly diving and swooping; all the while cawing and calling. Occasionally, individual pairs or larger groups broke off and made a detour for themselves, disappearing into the woods or simply flying a short distance before returning and merging back into the larger flock...

I don't know how long I stood there gaping. I have never seen anything like it, neither before nor since.

Unlike jackdaws and magpies, for example, ravens are not flock birds, neither during breeding season nor the rest of the year. You might see groups of five, seven individuals flying together in late summer and autumn, but then it's a pair with their fledged young practicing before definitively leaving their parents. Seeing this many gathered at this time of year was simply incomprehensible. I wish I could describe how they moved so you could see what I saw. It was so evident that they were communicating with each other, acting collectively, almost as if they were engaged in a game or dance with specific moves; an activity with a definite purpose that momentarily overshadowed the need to compete for mates and territories.

A word that came to mind was "raven gathering." I don't know where I got it from, as I haven't been able to find it documented in books or on the internet since.

The ravens must have gathered for a reason. When I finally tore myself away, I rushed home to my bird books, but found no explanations. The next day, I returned in hopes of seeing them again, but the sky was empty of black birds. It wasn't until I entered the forest that I heard them: more ravens than usual in the same area, hidden in the treetops. Like teasing, black shadows, they flickered at the edges of my vision, following me from a distance as if they knew I had observed their secret gathering and were curious about how much I knew. They were still in the neighborhood, but yesterday's playtime had evidently ended.

It would take almost a year and a half before I got an explanation for what I had seen. As everyone knows, 2020 and 2021 were, to say the least, special years. An unforeseen effect of all the remote work during Covid-19 was that new paths began to appear in the forests around my suburban area, as more people than usual chose nature over the gym. Accustomed to having the forests to myself, I found it quite annoying to suddenly encounter mountain bikers and other hikers, but at the same time, it gave me new trails to explore.

I had saved exploring one that looked particularly promising for a vacation day in late August 2021, when I had my favorite companion with me. Let's call her "Lass": a Parson Russell Terrier that I borrow from a neighbor once a week. She is a delightful, exuberantly happy little girl who looks a bit like Tintin's Snowy but with a brown ear, and who loves to go on adventures with me in wilder terrain than her owner dares to venture. It's especially fun to see how bold she is today, considering she is a rescue dog who, when I first met her, was afraid of everything. It took time before she dared to greet strangers, let alone join me on a walk, so having the trust to care for her and even groom her now feels fantastic. When we go out together, we are The Two Musketeers, and her owner is used to getting her back happy and tired with dirty paws and nose.

We set out with my fanny pack loaded with dog treats and water for both of us. It was a sunny late summer day, but not so hot that we couldn't manage a long walk. The new trail I had scoped out began quite a distance into a forest road we had already walked many times, and when Lass realized we were trying something new, she became ecstatic. Ideally, she wanted us to plunge headlong into the unknown, so since the trail wound up and down between rocks and roots where bike tires had occasionally mashed the surface into mud, it was me who had to slow down. After all, I don't have the tireless endurance of a terrier in her prime, and besides, I love blueberries. Lass probably got quite tired of my constant picking pauses.

We had a lovely walk. Not a person in sight, just a sun-warmed path winding through diverse woodland, far from any houses. You couldn't even hear the traffic in the distance. I thought I knew exactly what types of nature were in my area, but I was surprised by how varied the landscape was. At one point, we passed through an unexpected clearing in the middle of the forest, where the ground suddenly turned sandy and covered with waist-high shimmering silver grass that rippled like a water surface. It felt like an old meadow that for some mysterious reason had never grown back. A beautiful dry-stone wall ran like a straight line across the steep slope of the clearing.

It was when we crossed that low wall that the silence came. Suddenly, the wind wasn't heard anymore, nor all those other sounds that belong to a summer forest. No birds moving in the vegetation, no creaking branches; nothing but the steps of me and The Girl. I could see bicycle tracks and occasional footprints showing that people regularly moved here, but it still felt... secluded, in some way. As if we were just passing through the place, not being a part of it. It was absolutely not an uncomfortable feeling. Not then.

I've already mentioned the blueberries, but not how they just kept getting bigger and bigger the farther we went. Blueberries grow everywhere where I live, but I'm not exaggerating: these were as big as sloe berries, almost like small grapes. I couldn't stop eating. It reminded me of some reason of "Hansel and Gretel." In hindsight, it almost felt like they were a lure. Or forbidden fruit, not meant for intruders.

When the lake appeared, I was completely unprepared. In one moment, we were struggling up a rather challenging hillside, between shrubs and junipers that shaded the sunlight, and when I saw the first silver shimmer, I thought it was another clearing with rippling grass. But no, there it was suddenly: a real lake. As I said, I'm surrounded by bogs and marshes, and within reasonable cycling distance from the sea, which I love to swim in. But if there's one thing I've missed, it's a swimming lake. I really thought I would have known if there was something like that in the area, but suddenly I stood there at the water's edge, looking out over a silent and shimmering water mirror. The lake was framed on all sides by trees growing right up to the edges, as large as a couple of football fields and shaped almost like a serpent's tongue. Two tapering bays disappeared into the forest on the right, opposite a rounded edge where the open water transitioned into a bog with lush pink-green white moss. Right where I stood, there was a small rocky ledge where one could step into. I could see maybe twenty centimeters down, before the water became too dark. It actually looked deep enough for a swim...

It sounds like I stood dreaming for a long time, but all that passed through my head in an instant, the second before The Girl threw herself in with a gigantic splash. I don't know who was more shocked; her or me. You see, she's terrified of water. She's the dog that strictly keeps a safety distance on beach walks, the one I had to carry over a shallow puddle earlier that year when the tractor path across the bog was flooded. Normally, I have to bribe her with treats and coax her with infinite patience to cross ordinary ditches, but now she just threw herself in. Almost as if she was following some command stronger than herself.

I saw her panic, flail at the end of the leash, and almost disappear under the surface. She tried to hoist herself onto the floating mat of white moss but of course sank through, with a sucking sound that panicked me. I've stepped into that kind of ground before and you can easily lose your shoes there if you're not unlucky enough to sink so deep that you get stuck.

Wetlands can be dangerous, truly, for both humans and animals. Without thinking, I pulled on the leash while Lass tried to back away through the boggy ground. In a flash, she lay panting back on solid ground, dirty and soaked through. She rushed up to shake the water from her fur and lick my whole face when I hugged her, so I knew she was okay, even though we had a scare. My worst fear is that something will happen to her when I borrow her. I thought her owner probably wouldn't be too happy to get her back quite so dirty, but when I wanted to scoop a little water over her with my hands, she rushed away from the lake. Her gaze seemed to say, "No way, I'm not falling for that trick again!"

I comforted her with pats and treats, and my little buddy showed with all the clarity that she wanted to continue the hike. I had no idea how long we had been out, but I thought we would probably have time for another round before it was time to return her. I had a guess as to where the path that continued along the lake should come out, and thought we'd soon be back on familiar ground.

I was wrong. The forest was still strangely quiet, but it wasn't until we had passed the lake that that enclosing silence began to feel uncomfortable. There was something about how dense the vegetation was, and the path had twisted and turned so many times that I knew I was beginning to lose my sense of direction. Quite soon after the lake, we came to a crossroads, and the paths that ran off in three different directions no longer looked as well-trodden. I looked around to try to determine which way the forest might possibly thin out, and that was when I saw it: a dead great tit lying on a rotting stump. It wasn't very badly damaged, just a dead small bird lying there on its back, yellow and black against the bright green moss. I often come across dead animals and their remains during my walks, and over the years I have collected a small collection of skulls. Although it is always sad to see a life come to an end, I usually console myself that it means many others get food: everything from predators to insects, microorganisms and plants are fed on by the rotting bodies of others. Finding corpses is an unavoidable part of being in nature.

But my gaze fell on another stump, and on the blue tit that had been laid there. Neatly, almost as if it was lying on a set table. And beyond it, on a higher stump where the beige feather suit blended in so well that I initially missed it: a robin, lying on its side with one wing outstretched. Nearby: the remains of a house sparrow or pilfink, more ruffled than the others, but placed just as nicely on top of a spruce stump. It was as if I had happened to walk into someone's pantry, and I didn't know what to believe. Sure, I had probably read that buzzards could do that, save a prey for later somewhere where they could watch over it? But so many at once? Or were we closer to civilization than I thought? Was it a child who had arranged a small animal cemetery for birds that had collided with a window?

Lass pulled and tugged on the leash and I let her choose the path, bewildered and by now pretty eager to find the nearest way home. She usually has better local knowledge than I do, and when we're out clearing bushes, she's often the one who finds a real path again, which she shows me to say, "look, here it's much easier to walk!" But this time it was a bad strategy. Before I knew it, our path had almost disappeared in the blueberry shrubs, and I began to doubt it was a human path. Of course, game trails are just as good to follow, but have a tendency to pass through areas where as a bipedal you do not have as easy to get through. Lass was still rushing forward as if she had a definite goal in sight, but I started to get tired.

That's when I made that mistake you absolutely shouldn't make, especially not when you're without a map and it's starting to get late. I left the trail to head in the direction where I thought the forest would eventually open up into the valley.

Needless to say, we were soon lost. When I realized we had wandered off course, I tried to backtrack but couldn't even find the trail. Lass and I have been in this situation before, and it has always helped to let her, with her fantastic sense of smell, lead us back on track. But this time, it was as if she didn't understand what I wanted when I tried to encourage her, both in words and gestures, to take the lead. She settled down at my feet and seemed perfectly content to sit there and look soulfully at me. I couldn't see the sun over the treetops anymore and knew I had probably missed the agreed pick-up time. Her owner and my mom were probably imagining that I was lying somewhere with a broken leg.

Then suddenly, it was as if Lass heard something, a sound that made her leap up with pointed ears and her whole body alert, though I couldn't hear it. Just like at the lake, she practically shot off, so I almost lost the leash, right into the thick underbrush. I've known many dogs behave like this when they get wind of some prey, but Lass hunting instincts are strictly limited to digging for voles or sitting under trees and whining after squirrels. We've encountered both roe deer and foxes without her reacting, so this was something else. I stumbled and tripped over tufts of grass that gave way under my feet as I tried to keep up. To my relief, the opening behind a huge windfall turned out to be a bend in a path. Maybe even the one we had come on? Lass pulled like crazy, and I let her choose the direction, full of praise for my own little Lassie.

I still thought we were on the right track until the path suddenly sloped steeply downhill, into a ravine that we had definitely not passed before. Suddenly, all the trees were spruce and pine, so tall and dense that the sun didn't reach the ground, which was brown and yielding like a slippery carpet of pine needles. A small stream burst forth beside the path, and the whole landscape just felt... alien. It didn't fit with anything I knew about my local area. The air was so cold that you could hardly believe it was midsummer, and there was something so strange about the water. Although it foamed against the rocks, I couldn't hear it flowing. Only Lass panting.

I tried to hold her back, but she literally threw herself forward on the leash, standing on two legs with eyes bulging while whining loudly. And yes, I'm a total softie who can't manage to drag an unwilling dog along. Of course, I could have carried her, and it definitely felt like we were heading in completely the wrong direction, but at the same time... Shouldn't she, with her sense of direction, know better than a human without any local knowledge? After being out for so long, she must be longing to go home now, right? And the path was definitely a well-trodden human path again — one that must lead to human habitation. I decided we would see what lay at the bottom of the ravine. If it was nothing I recognized, I would simply have to carry her back up and try the opposite direction. At worst, sooner or later, we would come somewhere where I could borrow a phone.

We more or less slid down to the bottom of the ravine, and there, to my surprise, the path abruptly ended. Or rather, it disappeared into a gigantic blackthorn thicket, tangled and thorny, covered in a scruffy gray blanket of lichen. The lack of sunlight had stifled it, and it barely had any leaves of its own. Anyone who has tried to penetrate a blackthorn hedge knows it's doomed to fail: the thorns may not be curved like rose thorns, but they are long and can pierce through both clothing and thick shoe soles, not to mention that the slender branches are tough and tangled like honeysuckle. Blackthorn hedges are perfect hiding places for animals.

But as I said, this was dead, and through the lichen-covered tangle, I could see walls. Stone walls. My tiredness just disappeared, as it always does when I find some forgotten historical relic. Lass and I rounded the thicket, and on the backside, we found a rather uncomplicated way into the tangle, where the branches were already broken. We had to climb over a small stone wall that reached my knees and step carefully over a thick layer of moss, scattered with bleached sticks. Where the thicket was densest, I saw the stone wall make a ninety-degree turn, and on the other side of the house foundation, where the ground sloped downward, it became higher, almost like a built-up terrace. Traces of a square shape with a clear opening could have been an old sheep pen.

Finding just that was thrilling enough, but the house itself left me astounded. The stone walls towered up to my shoulders, and I'm not short. By comparison, the foundation of the soldier's cottage at Green Hill barely reaches my ankles. It's just the faint outlines of two rooms with a collapsed chimney in the center and scattered remnants of roof tiles—not much to brag about, but remarkably preserved for a dwelling that has been abandoned for two centuries. My mom has chronicled the history of Green Hill and the soldiers stationed there in our local history book, yet I had never heard of this particular building. It wasn't just a mere foundation; it boasted complete stone walls, noticeably thicker than the one we had climbed over, with only a single doorway on the short side facing the path. No chimney protruded from its structure. The enclosed space within the walls was smaller than Green Hill, perhaps three square meters at most. If there were no window openings, I couldn't fathom how dark and chilling it must have been inside when it was covered by a roof and a door. Could it genuinely have been a residence? What else could it possibly have been? Animal pens don't resemble this structure, yet I had a distinct impression that its purpose was more about confinement than protection from the elements.

Lass and I made our way around to the doorway and stepped inside... and then I just stared.

The house; the ruin; was full of bones. Large, robust bones, perfectly picked clean, in all muted shades from ash gray to dirty white via algae-covered green. Here I could easily embroider my story, say I thought they were human bones... but even though the vertebrae and bone joints were similar, I saw immediately from the skulls that they weren't. They were wild boar. Not the largest I've seen, but fully grown animals, with the kind of tusks that have long been bred out of domestic pigs. Hooves, intact spines, pelvic bones... The parts were scattered across the entire floor, even up on the stone walls. I counted at least six skulls... and realized that the brown carpet on the floor wasn't dead pine needles as I had thought. It was fur. These bodies had been freshly slaughtered when they were dumped here. That was when I realized that the bleached sticks we had stepped over on the way through the thicket weren't tree branches. They were also bones. I turned around and saw them covering the ground around the ruin, strewn throughout the area. I saw at least four more skulls, sunken into the moss but not overgrown by it. But as scattered as the bones were, there could be even more individuals, perhaps a whole herd.

That's when it clicked, and I finally understood what I had seen that spring day. A crow meeting. They had been right over this forest, and what I had witnessed was their banquet, complete with feasting and dancing. The scavengers had been attracted here by fresh carcasses, and it was probably them who had spread out the remains around the area to feast without crowding each other. There had been enough for everyone, without the need to compete for food. Which meant all the skeletal parts came from wild boars killed at the same time.

That's when I got scared, because there's only one predator in the forests of Northern Maryland that behaves like this: humans. But not a reasonable human. Wild boars are game animals, and I knew they had been hunted in our area several times in the past year to protect people's properties. But what you have to understand is that serious hunters don't behave like this. First of all, there are specific rules for how they dispose of carcasses, and secondly, it's not as simple as hunting a wild boar as you might think. They are fast and surprisingly good at hiding, and after the first shot has scared the herd into flight, they are like camouflaged tanks that can break through fences. I've talked to trackers who have spent several days tracking down and successfully hunting just one injured boar. How could anyone have managed to kill so many, just to dump the bodies here of all places, in a ruin inside a thicket in the middle of nowhere? How many hunters would it take for that? It couldn't be someone who had used poison. If so, I would have found dead crows in the forest the next day, instead of satisfied and cheeky pranksters?

I was so shocked by our find that I didn't notice Lass reaction. Not until she sat on my foot, trembling. My little adventure companion who had come all this way sat with her tail between her legs, crouching as close to my legs as she could. The only times I've seen her scared like this is during thunderstorms. Then she becomes completely unresponsive, and no matter what you do to comfort her, all you can do is wrap her in a blanket and wait it out. But the sky was silent: not even the faintest rumble. And I couldn't remember the last time we had seen another living creature out in the forest. No birds in the trees or paddling on the lake, no chewed pine cones, no traces of rabbits or moose droppings. Instead, I saw condensation trickling down the inside of the stone walls, as if the air inside was much colder. When I exhaled a slow breath, it formed a pale gray mist that hung in the air without dissipating. Lass had her hackles raised, and I understood her perfectly, for I could feel the hairs on my own body standing on end.

The only way I can describe the atmosphere down there at the bottom of the ravine is unsettling. Enclosed and lifeless yet somehow fermenting with menace. Like a can that has been left to spoil, about to burst from within under pressure.

I scooped Lass up in my arms and ran as best I could through sharp sloe hedges and up the steep path covered in dead needles. She lay like a stone in my arms, trembling until we reached the crest and the path turned away from the stream. When the warmth suddenly returned and the pine forest gave way to mixed woods, she began to struggle to get down, and then she led the way at her usual brisk pace. But not nearly as hysterically as she had bolted in the opposite direction.

As we distanced ourselves from the ravine, my own panic ebbed, and I began to wonder what I had frightened myself about. There had been no one chasing us, just an indomitable feeling that whoever had created that slaughterhouse couldn't find us there. As if we were intruding - perhaps had been since we crossed the clearing with the silver grass.

The feeling that I had worked myself up for nothing disappeared when we suddenly reached a crossroads, and I realized we were back at the point where we had gotten lost. By the stumps with the dead small birds. Coming from this direction, something caught my eye that I hadn't noticed before. There was one more bird, a tiny wren perched on the rotting trunk of an aspen. Together, the birds were arranged in the shape of an arrow, pointing towards the one of the three paths that Lass and I had just come from. Whatever we had witnessed the aftermath of, it was something quietly ongoing.

The epilogue will surely come as an anticlimax. We hurried back the same way we came, and when we reached the lake, I spotted a path that continued in the opposite direction, which I decided to take a chance on. Perhaps foolhardy, after we had already been lost, but this time it paid off. That path turned out to lead straight to where I had thought we were headed: out into the valley. As we walked the final stretch, down the steepest slope, I saw clear stone edges running parallel to the path on both sides among the trees - evidence that our little footpath had once been a proper road. Then we were out in the open, and could rush home to reassure our families, who weren't nearly as worried as I had expected. We had gone much farther than I thought, but at the same time, it wasn't as late in the day as it had felt.

I can't reconcile the time we spent in the forest.

Since then, I've made a couple of discoveries that might be worth mentioning. The first thing I did that evening after showering was dig out all the old maps my mom used for the local history book. Then, I browsed through the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and U.S. Geological Survey websites, examining more maps, and the result is always the same: the lake is there, recognizable by its shape, but it lacks a name. It's perplexing because even the smallest ponds on the old plot maps have names like Eric Pond, Torb Lake, Swamp Lake, Stone Spring Lake, Timber Lake—just not this lake. Similarly, the old parish roads through the forest are clearly marked with dotted lines, but not the road I saw the remains of, the one leading up to the lake. All the old cottages and cabins are marked, but not the peculiar stone cottage full of bones.

My attempts to find the landowner led to a dead end. The forest surrounding the lake consists of straight pieces of land that stretch all the way down to the farms in the valley. However, scattered among these parcels is a small, irregularly shaped piece resembling a puzzle, containing only the lake and a narrow extension that appears to mark the remnants of an old road. The ownership status is designated as "Undivided." In practical terms, this indicates that the land has remained unaffected by all land reforms since the 1700s, when efforts began to consolidate the often small, scattered, and diverse land parcels of landowners into contiguous plots. A piece of undivided land today could have numerous individual owners, each holding ownership of a few square meters, necessitating unanimous agreement for any activity on the land. This situation similarly applies to the bog near our residential area. The undivided status of the land often serves as the most reliable assurance that it will remain undisturbed, given the substantial difficulty in tracing the owners. Descendants of the original owners may have relocated or passed away, and not all may be aware of their inherited portion

So my last resort to find out more has been to call around to farmers who I know have inherited farms. One of them knew exactly which lake I meant and could tell me that someone had a boat there when he was a child, maybe to fish for eel. Once, when he was out hunting in the winter, his dog got stuck in the lake. She just rushed right into the icy water without him being able to see what she was chasing, and didn't seem to hear him calling. He had to wade out and rescue her, then run home in sub-zero temperatures with wet clothes. He certainly believed you could swim in the lake, but he couldn't remember ever hearing a name for it.

I can't help but wonder why. In an area that has been inhabited for so long and continuously, regarding a lake that has clearly been used by people and where the effort has been made to build a road through difficult terrain... All the other lakes have names.

There is indeed something strange about the lake. I've been back several times since last summer and never seen a single bird on the water or in the air above it. It's always eerily calm, regardless of the wind, and last winter when even the nearby sea and the inflow to the marshes started to freeze, the lake remained unfrozen. It's as if the world is holding its breath there.

I don't know if what Lass and I found in the stone cottage should be described as illegal, supernatural, or just secretive. All I know is that in the forest where I live in Maryland, there's a piece of land that seems unusually resistant to change. Where the berries grow larger than anywhere else, and where there's a lake that resists any name. Where dead birds point the way to a house where someone - or someones - with unusual hunting luck feast the [ravens.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAKDy2C2epnlNnlwYJa32aQ)
