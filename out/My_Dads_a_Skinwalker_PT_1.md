This story is for the sake of me passing on something I’ve learned from my time with my father. I loved my dad. More than anything, he’s my best friend, my muse, and the man I want to be. He was understanding, present, and someone who always had an optimistic outlook. When I think of my dad, I think of the time we spent fishing. In fact, that’s where the initial incident took place, the lake near our house.



I’ve always hated going there solely because of the sheer amount of bug bites I’d receive, but at the time of this story, I was heading off to college. I wanted to spend as much time with my Dad as possible before moving into my dorm room for the year. It seemed whenever we went fishing he told me more about himself than he ever would at home. It was therapeutic for both of us, catching fish was just a plus.



The lake was about 30 minutes away from our house, it’s secluded and hasn’t been discovered by a lot of people so thankfully there’s no trash near the shores and some of the walkways my Dad and I made are still there, untouched. We always made sure to go early in the morning so the summer sun wouldn’t scorch us too badly. In the mornings, right as the dew point was reached, a mist would form over the lake, and carry itself over the landscape around us. In an eerie way, it was beautiful. I would pretend that the two of us were old-timey fishermen coming to make our dues, put food on the table, and make money for the week.



Fascinations aside, the lake had a huge wildlife population, deer constantly roamed, ducks were always scouring the waters, and occasionally we would spot a fox roaming around. My Dad brought his kayak with him that day to let me try, and the problem was that I was too big. My Dad is 5’10 and I’m 6’2. My legs would bunch up, cramp, and fall asleep within a few minutes and once you’re on the water, you can’t just get up, you have to row back to land. My Dad is also a ‘More for me,’ kind of guy. The fact I couldn’t be on the kayak for long was no big deal to him because, within a moment, he was already at the other end of this massive lake, his bucket hat and tiny head obscured by the mist. 



It was all a coincidence that it took him. The fact I couldn’t ride the kayak across the lake but he could, it was all chance. I understand that now, and I’ve accepted it. It had been 30 minutes since I had seen my Dad disappear at the other end of the lake, and I started getting worried. Of course, it was probably longer since I had gotten it in my head that with my luck the moment I left, he’d return. He did leave his phone behind since he didn’t want it to get wet if he managed to catch anything.



I took the walkway we made over trampled heath, we left markers to help guide us around the sides and that’s where I saw him. It was just bright enough for the sun to shine down onto the bank, the kayak had been smashed and there were drops of blood just clinging to the leaves. I followed the trail slowly, leaf by bloody leaf. 



He had been struck in the head, I could see flecks of blood from his ears and nose as his eyes were upturned from his sunken face. He looked on unknowingly to the sun as if his final thoughts were prayers to God. The thing that did this, was cloaked in the mist and tucked behind tree trunks and branches. It wanted something from my Dad and it was determined to receive it. Through the streaks of sunlight, I caught it’s figure. It was tall, almost double my size, its eye sockets were hollow with yellow beads of light where its eyes were. It had no ears, only holes to capture auditory information. Its limbs were slender and loose like boiled meat with a similar complexion too. I don’t know if it was stronger than me but it was stronger than my Dad. I should’ve done something but I was petrified, my father, the man who raised me, and cared for me, was being mutilated in an odd way.



It’s like, it didn’t want to eat him, or anything it was as if it was climbing INTO him. Over a few minutes, I watched this thing contort itself, break its limbs, and fix itself into a little drill-like shape, where it slowly wound itself into my Dad’s gullet before orienting itself within him. I was watching the outline of this creature make a new home from inside. The odd finger or digit appeared from his mouth, and then the convulsions started. He shook violently, muscles spasming and contracting, his vocal cords straining and stretching as sound escaped him. 



Then it stopped, his eyes oriented, rolling around before stopping dead ahead as the rays of light soon faded. Recognition filled his eyes and he stood up unblinking. His chest rose as air filled his lungs and exhaled slowly. He cleared his throat, and with a calculated expression began calling out ‘T-T… Taylor! Tay-tay? Help! I think I hit my head!’ His face suddenly became concerned, and as he moved towards the kayak, a cold paralyzing fear had washed over me. My Dad started looking for me.
