I'm an absolute freak for horror. Ever since I was just a little kid, I've been obsessed. My parents used to find me with my nose damn near pressed to the TV in the middle of the night, watching scary movies at low volume to not wake them. Sure, I got scolded, but I later discovered that both of them found it cute. 

The fascination never really stopped. As a middle schooler, I was always the one showing creepy online videos to my classmates, and telling scary stories around the flickering campfire in summertime. There were a number of kids wherever I went, whether it was school or summer camp, who really came to dislike me. I gave them nightmares, instilled the fear of the boogeyman in them, made them question the long shadows cast in the corner of their rooms at nighttime. Soon enough, everyone just started calling me Spooky Lucy. As far as nicknames go, it could have been a lot worse. I almost wished it was a bit cooler, but it stuck. It still sticks even now. Everyone just calls me “Spooky.”

When I got old enough to have real friends— the kind of friends that you actually bond over stuff with instead of just playing together in the park because your parents tolerate each other enough to sit on a bench together— things changed. I didn’t have much in the way of IRL friends— pretty much just my buddy Mike that I met way back in grade school— but I started making real friends online, on Reddit. I joined ALL of the horror forums, but the only one that really pertains to this story is r/scarystories. This shit was a whole new world. Reading hundreds of thousands of stories written by independent authors; hidden gems that I would never find on store shelves...it was heaven. My friends would always send me whichever ones they thought were cool, or stupid. Some of my favorite pieces of horror literature EVER have come from that place, and other reddit forums. I can say now that I’ve been through a lot of horrific shit in my life, and yet I still consume some form of horror-related media every day. I can’t help it. It’s in my bones.

I mentioned online friends before. In particular, I'm in a Discord server with a few other horror fans. Notably, there's Mike, Seanie, Liv, Laika, Shredder, and Ghostie. Fuck, did these people get me through some shit. As things usually go for “weird kid” teens, my life wasn't that easy. Things get lonely when your only tangible real-world friend is such a recluse that he’s out of school almost as much as he’s in it. I was alone and fending for myself, and the bullies and cliquey girls could smell the vulnerability on me like sharks in the water. Depression set in soon after, and I felt a general distaste for life setting in like a bad smell in a carpet. Adults would tell me it would get better in my twenties, like that was supposed to make me feel any better. 

They all helped me beyond measure, but I’d say I owe the most to Laika. Obviously, that's not her real name. Her username was “laika722” pretty much everywhere. I don't exactly remember how we met, but I know that I wouldn't be who I am today if it weren't for her. I know her real name, but it feels... inappropriate to share it. Laika was a private person, and I don't want anyone to be able to find her online. Maybe that seems like a given on the Internet, but after everything that’s happened it’s hard to keep myself from spilling the truth, just so someone can hear me. Don't bother looking up her username, you won't find much more than some random Instagram account that isn't her, and maybe an old Flash game she made if you look hard enough. I doubt it though. Don't try reddit either, as all of her usernames on here are randomly generated.

About a year ago, Laika fell off the face of the earth. Her Discord was gone, her Reddit stories and Flash games were all wiped, everything was just...gone. Immediately I feared the worst. Laika was troubled, for sure. I know her mental health wasn’t exactly stable, nor was life with her horrible family. College seemed to be helping her, but obviously the first thing all of us thought was that she had taken her life. Even if that was the case, I would’ve preferred learning that to not knowing anything at all. She was strange and a bit dark, speaking in run-on poetic sentences that made no sense half of the time, but that's just who she was. She was like me. My twin flame. Losing her was the second worst thing that had ever happened to me. Not knowing what happened to her at all was the worst. I loved Laika more than anything in this world. We used to fall asleep on the phone together, or on a video call just so we could watch each other sleep. To see the others chest rise and fall, and listen to the soft sounds of breathing on the other line. Sometimes Laika would talk in her sleep. I never knew what she was saying because I don't speak her native language, but I liked to listen.

She was everything to me. Everything and more.

Our friend group was devastated. I had been given the privilege of being closest to her, so everyone thought I would have all the information. And they begged me for it. They begged for some little key to breaking open the mystery of where she had gone. I so badly wished that I could tell them that I DID have those answers. I can't count the amount of times I’ve panned through thousands upon thousands of our messages together, searching for even the tiniest thing I had missed. There had to be something. I couldn't rest until I found SOMETHING.

It took a few months, but eventually I did.

Our little group stayed together through the hardships. No one else ever found anything, but that never stopped them from looking. We even found her old YouTube account and messaged all 5 of her subscribers about her whereabouts, but no one had even known Laika personally. It was dead end after dead end, but we never stopped. Eventually the weight of the real world forced us to kind of move on. I was a senior in college at that point, working on my senior project (a shitty B-list horror movie that was almost TOO fun to make). I still talked to my friends all the time, but we didn’t have the time or the energy to keep chasing rabbit holes and then wrestling with the inevitable disappointment. So every night I would open up Discord, call with my friends, share stories around, and watch movies with them. My routine was simple and familiar. If I changed it, I might have lost my mind. Being with these people was as close as I could possibly be to the love of my life. People tell you it's weird or dangerous to fall in love online. I personally don’t believe that. But even if it were true, I would still choose Laika no matter what. I would live through it all again, even knowing that she would disappear and break my heart. I would find Laika in any lifetime, I really would. I like to think she would do the same. 

One day, Seanie sent me a message with a link to a story.

"holy shit dude u gotta read this one itz crazyyyyy"

Obviously I was going to click it, but before I even had the chance to open it, Shredder was messaging me, too.

“Hey R. Thought you might like this one. Best stuff I've read in a while."

They had both sent me the same story. “7591” by user “fmfthiri.” It's not up anymore. I don't think it ever really was. There was nothing there. The page was just an empty. Not an error page. Just a completely empty body in the place where the story would be.

"wtf lol" I responded. 

Before I could do anything else, a third friend messaged me. It was the exact same link.

"discord user r u need to read this story oh mah gaaaaaaaaaaaaa xD” was what Liv texted me. Please don't make fun of her for the way she types, by the way. We have tried, and failed. She's a sensitive girl.

I don’t know why I bothered clicking it again. I had already seen it. To absolutely nobody’s surprise, it was the exact same. 

Except for one detail. 

When I scrolled all the way down, the word "hello" was written at the very bottom. I wondered if this was meant to be part of the scare. Maybe it was supposed to make me feel like I was going crazy. If that was the goal, it was working.

"if one more of u freaks send me a link to that 7591 story im coming w the cleaver"

That was my message in the server we shared. Joking around with them in our usual macabre way was all I could really think of doing. It was such a small thing, a little Internet trick that could probably be easily explained, but it put me in a deep sense of unease. It was the first time in a very long time that anything horror-related made me feel true dread, and I couldn’t even explain why.

"but r i swear it's good just trust me i'm a palllll r i'm a pal" Seanie responded

"Oh this one? I just read it, it's great wytb" sent Ghostie, with that link again. 

I clicked it. Now I just really wanted to know what sort of elaborate troll this was. Invested, I scrolled through the blank space again, to see if anything had changed. “hello” was gone. Now it was just “r” in the middle of the page, alone in the void like a tiny island in an endless sea of white.

"IT JUST SAYS R WHYARE U TROLLINGV" I hastily replied, not even bothering to fix the typos.

It felt like it was calling out to me. Reasonably I shouldn’t have felt that way. It’s just one letter out of 26 letters in the alphabet, it’s not like the letter “r” automatically refers to me. I promise I’m not some sort of egomaniac. But there was just…something about it. As though the page itself had a voice. A voice that was calling to me specifically.

"wutttt it's like abt a girl with a bunch of eyes its so kewl" said Liv, with her typing style that hadn’t changed since 2012. 

"What lol? It was about a submarine that comes across a bigass humanoid skeleton that only had lungs underwater" responded Shredder.

The chat exploded with messages from different friends who had all clicked on this link. Ghostie claimed the story was about a newspaper documenting some cannibal cult, Seanie said it was about an old man haunted by his dog, and even Mike had his own take, saying it was about a guy and a girl who could only communicate through dreams. They all sent the exact same link, but each one had read a completely different story. I refreshed the link again while the notifications came flooding in. I was frustrated! Even through that dread I so badly wanted to read the stories they were talking about, because they all sounded fascinating! I wished that I could see ANY story on that web page, anything to pull me out of the anxious chill running through my body. But no such luck. Still just blank space. The only change was that now the “r” had moved to the top of the page.

"ur all stupid bye" I responded, closing Discord and muting it to focus on better things. 

I had a final project due in three days, I didn’t have time to be spooked and haunted. That was what I told myself, anyway. 

Look, I tried to let it go. I TRIED to focus on editing "Vampiric Undead Robots 3: The Wigglers" for as long as I could (there are no Vampiric Undead Robots 1 or 2). As fascinating as my dumb film was, I couldn't get 7591 out of my head. I relented after a particularly boring editing session and opened up the link again, just to see if it had changed again. The top was empty once again. In the middle of the page now was a single “u.” 

hello. r. r. u. 

I started to jot each result down, just in case. It never hurt to be a little overly analytical.

I opened Discord again to send a passive aggressive "haha, you got me, now give it up" message into chat, only to find a message from Mike. 

"Hey man" was all it said. 

Mike was a man of few words and very little charisma.

"bro be honest am i being fucked with bc its kinda dumb lol" I typed back. 

I just wanted to know. How was it possible for all of them to have read the best story they’d ever seen, with the story being different for each person, all from one Reddit link? The more I thought about it, the more I realized the stories my friends had described perfectly matched up with their interests. Liv loved weird body horror with female leads, Shredder was into Lovecraftian ocean stuff, Ghostie was super into true crime, Seanie loved sweet stories portrayed through a horror lens, and Mike...I didn't really know what to make of Mike's. Mike was a slasher guy. His favorite movie is Terrifier 2, and he goes as Leatherface every year for Halloween. Maybe he had a newfound love of romance? He did cry his eyes out watching Notting Hill and The Notebook, so it wasn’t that hard to believe.

Regardless, I couldn’t help but feel jealous again. Everyone else got a special curated story, but I just got a blank page and an unexplainable sense of dread? If there was a malevolent force at play here all I really wanted to know was what I did to make it like me less than the others.

"I honestly have no idea what's going on. The story I read was fucking great but I can't find it anymore man. I hope you trust me.” Mike said.

I really did trust him. I had known him too long not to. Besides, he wasn’t really the pranking type. I was his only close friend that lived anywhere nearby, and we had known each other since age nine. I feel bad sometimes when I think about Mike, and how big of a crush he used to have on me. When Laika and I got close, he kinda got grouped in with all the others even though I'd known him the longest. I know that it hurt him, and that's totally on me, but he was really cool about it. All any of us ever wanted was to make Laika as happy as she made us. Laika was a gloomy person with a lot of issues, but man did she know how to light up a room when it counted. I truly believe that all of us would have done anything for her. She wrote beautifully, she produced incredible scores for movies that would never exist, and above all, she always had a way of making people feel accepted. She wasn't overly nice or anything, but she was comforting. Despite all she had gone through, she was always the best shoulder to cry on. Fuck. I was talking about Mike, and there I go again, raving about Laika. If Laika was the love of my life, Mike was the friend of my life if that makes any sense. I wish I’d treated him better. 

"i trust u. what do u think is going on?" I typed, unsure of how to respond.

"It's blank for me now. Has anything come up for you?" 

I checked again. The top and middle were back to being totally blank. But at the bottom was the word “there.” 

hello, r, r, u, there 

I couldn’t help but laugh at myself. I felt like I was going nuts. There was no doubt in my mind that this was a message, a message meant for me and only me. I had spent my life preparing for horror movie scenarios. Spirits in my house or a killer on the loose. But this felt different. And I felt wholly unprepared. Just scrying in the dark through a Reddit link that defied all comprehension.

"nothing yet i have to go to bed tho goodnight love u dude" I sent to Mike, quickly closing the app and feverishly refreshing the page for the short story. I tried this for about fifteen minutes, but nothing changed. I wondered if it was all over. I wondered if any of it had happened at all, or if years of horror movies and scary games had rotted away my synapses to the point that I was completely gullible. 

I was about to give up when the next word finally appeared. “sleep" was in the middle of the page. 

Well great. Now I was scared to sleep.  I didn't sleep all night. I checked the page every few hours, and nothing changed. Nothing but "sleep". I watched the sun rise as my eyes grew crusty with sleeplessness, and eventually had to muster up the strength to waddle to class. I made it about halfway through the day before my body ran out of strength and school got too boring, and I passed out in the middle of class.

Suddenly, I was wading in dark water, only illuminated by tiny pinprick stars in the empty black sky. From far away, I could hear some water sloshing in the distance. It was cold and uncomfortable at first, but soon came to be refreshing, like a swimming pool on a summer day. I felt the water clear as day, but the air had no real temperature to it. It was almost like there wasn't any at all. That's the only way I can explain it. Cold water and blank air. 

"Hello?" I called out in a voice softer than I had intended. 

I don't know why it came out like that, but from far away, I heard the water swish, and saw a vague outline of a person turning around. I analyzed the figure for a little while before putting my cold, wet hands up to my mouth and letting out a shrill gasp.

It was her. Unmistakably, it was her.

I could see the shadow of her short, flippy brown bob, and her thin frame. She was the right height. It was Laika. Without thinking, I swam through the water as fast as I could, trying to reach her. I had never even seen her in real life outside of the pictures she took of herself. This was the closest I had ever been. Even if she hadn't been missing for almost a year, I would still swim as fast as I was swimming then. I was getting closer. 

The water was getting colder. Much colder. It wasn't refreshing anymore. It chilled my body from the outside in, to the point that it started to burn. I could barely feel my hands, but I didn't stop until I got to her. I refused to. I came up from under the water and grabbed her tight. She was so warm. Someone so warm did not belong in these frigid waters soaked with stars. I looked her in her light brown eyes for just a second, scanned her freckle filled face, and cupped her cheek with my hand, hot tears running down my face. 

"My head is filled with a stinging pulse, it's eating me alive, Spooky.” Her eyes rolled in the back of her head, switching from caramel brown, to blank orbs resembling the sparkling pitch black sky.

I woke up with a start, screaming and disrupting math class. I was white-knuckling my desk, and the ache of tense muscles started to set in. 

The professor escorted me out and asked me if everything was alright. I tried to explain myself but I didn’t know what parts to include and what parts to leave out, so I just ended up stammering out a string of nonsense. The professor took pity on me and excused me a few minutes early. She could tell even more than I could that I was a complete mess.

That was a few days ago, but it still feels so fresh in my mind. I’ve been so haunted by that dream. Laika felt so warm. I felt everything. I FELT her. I know I love fiction, but I'm a pretty level headed person. I've always known what was real, and what was fake. I knew that the ghosts and ghouls in the media I consumed wouldn't pop out of the screen or the pages and get me, and I knew that when I laid my head down I would be safe and wake up to live my normal life, making movies and fucking around online. 

I thought I had it all figured out until I got this stupid fucking link, and now my entire world feels like a movie. I don't know what any of it means, and I pride myself on being able to know what shit means, you know? Am I crazy for wanting to wade in that ice cold water again just to see her?

All I know is that wading through that water and holding her felt more real than any interaction I’d ever had, let alone a dream. And I can’t help but wonder if the link is responsible.

”hello r, r u there". That has to be from her, or maybe I'm just piecing shit together in an attempt to chase after this girl in some sort of way, to feel like, somehow, that she's out there looking for me as hard as i've been looking for you. Have any of you ever seen 7591, or talked to this "fmfthiri"? Does anyone know laika722? Has anything even remotely like this happened to any of you? Has it happened to anyone? I need to know. If you can help me find her in any way, please. Please help.
