Please don’t judge me harshly when you read this. I really didn’t mean to do anything bad. I’m just an urbexer who loves abandoned places.

At this very moment, I’m trapped inside an abandoned hospital. I came here with my dslr to take some pics and... maybe to take stuff to sell. But I swear I didn’t mean to disturb anything. It’s abandoned, after all. I mean, if they left it here, it's not really stealing, right? I came here for the thrill and for the karma first. Oh God. I regret everything.

You may not know that but abandoned buildings always stink. It's usually a mix of 80% mold and 20% dust or the other way around. This time, though, it reeked of decay. As if the walls were full of rot or something. I didn't think anything of it because it used to be an actual hospital after all.

It was dark and eerily silent inside. I had a flashlight, but the silence creeped me out. No idea how they built this place, but it prevented any sound from the outside world from seeping in. I could almost hear my own heartbeat if it wasn’t for my footsteps reverberating in the empty corridor.

I walked up the stairs until I reached the top floor. There, I discovered a large storage room, filled with old medical equipment covered in a thick layer of dust. The room was a time capsule, left untouched for who knows how many years. It was the perfect place to look for some valuables.

I placed my flashlight on a shelf so I could use both hands to search through the boxes. Suddenly, my light toppled over, and the metal door slammed shut with a resounding echo. It was pitch black, and I began to panic. Seconds later, the halogen lights began to flicker, casting ominous shadows on the walls and racks. I was shaking, creeped out.

Something didn’t feel right about the shadows at the end of the room. I didn’t want to take any chances to be attacked by a wild animal or a junkie, so I used my camera to check instead. I peered through the viewfinder and jumped when I saw two eyes staring right back at me. I took another look and a second pair of eyes had appeared from behind the racks. They both looked like deformed human beings with too many limbs. I blinked, and their numbers doubled. I blinked again. Eight figures were in a crawling position on the ground.

As long as I kept my eyes open, they remained relatively still, swaying slightly. Each blink doubled their numbers. I turned and ran for the door. I glanced back without blinking and they were still in the same place, same position, staring at me.

I don’t know why but the door wouldn’t open. I shook it, I kicked it, but nothing worked. I was trapped. My eyes began to sting. When I looked back, I noticed that the light seemed to avoid those things. The closer they got, the more lights flickered off, leaving me with only their creepy silhouettes between the racks and boxes.

It’s funny how fast you can think in desperate situations. In my mind, I had found the answer: just one long blink to moisten my eyes and buy some time. What a mistake. The instant I closed my eyes, a scraping noise of bodies scurrying across the floor made me open them again. There were dozens of them, much closer than before. I blinked quickly and their numbers had doubled while they closed in, albeit slower. A few more blinks and they were almost within touching distance. I could see a hundred crawling shadows, breathing heavily, slowly swaying in place. They never blinked and their eyes followed me around.

With shaking hands, I pulled out my phone. My 911 call didn't go through. No answer from my family either. I didn't know what to do anymore. When they saw my distress, those things began to whisper, “Eat the thief”. What can I do? I'm trapped, stuck inside this room with all those creepy things. Someone tell me what to do. Please!

**EDIT:**

They’re closing in, chanting, “Eat the filthy thief, don’t make him leave.” Those voices aren't human. Fuck! I blinked again. Their twisted limbs are touching my shoes. One of them is grabbing my jeans. They're literally on me but I still can't see what they look like. It's as if they're consuming the light around them.

**EDIT 2:**

Please, anyone. What can I do? I can’t make calls. I can’t contact anyone. My eyes hurt so much. They're chanting louder and louder, and the smell is becoming unbearable. I have my back against the door, and it won't open no matter what. I don’t want to die here. My eyes are drying out and I dare not blink.
