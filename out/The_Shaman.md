I remember about 4 years ago my dad told me a story about the small little scar he has on his ear. One day when he was about 5 years old, he lived and partially grew up in a small village/town in Mexico. I don't know the specifics of where it was because he's lived in many small towns so i didn't ask. Anyway, when he was 5 years old him and his brother had just come back to his home after playing outside all day. Both of them were still pretty jittery after that they started playing tag in the kitchen. My grandmother was making food at the time and boiling some water. Well my dad bumped into the pot of boiling water and it ended up splashing all over the left side of his face. He stated that the water melted part of his ear off and parts of one side of his face.

Grandma was in shock and in disarray she had to act fast. So late into the night my grandma and grandpa and my dad went to a local Shaman, or Bruja. She had heard a playground rumor that there was a shaman in town and that she had the ability to heal severe wounds. My dad stated that he had heard weird chanting and whispers and strange choir like humming when they came close to the building. He couldn't tell much from his surroundings because he was in so much pain but he manage to make out what he saw when he went inside a brick building with other buildings connected to it. Almost like a small downtown shopping plaza but old. The Shaman had told grandma that she would need to have the child under her care for one night while they waited outside. The procedure that my father described was pretty bizarre. He saw the shaman mixing some odds and ends into a copper bowl with strange glyphs and writings on the copper bowl.

He then saw her put a strange small head not human but something different that he can't really describe may have been an ape of some kind and a liquid that he could only describe as blood. Then the shaman wrapped his face along with the contents of the mixing bowl in a type of leaf wrappings and from then on into the night all he heard was humming, and singing in a strange language. The morning finally came and grandma picked up her son and asked if he was going to be okay. She said that all would be fine but for the next two nights she needed to wear the beads that she handed her and that he needed to keep the wrappings on him and to keep her doors locked and to not go outside for anything while she had the beads on. So she did and, two days had passed and the beads were gone and so she got really spooked and went to check on her son and woke him up to check on his injuries. She carefully unwrapped the leaf bandaging and then saw that his injuries were gone. relived that her son wouldn't have a nasty burn scar the rest of his life. She went to the same place to thank and to repay her somehow, but when she arrived the building in the middle was gone.

It's as if the very building was taken to the sky leaving the pipes and gas lines exposed from the earth. She found burn marks on the floor and scuffing from where building used to be. She asked around the nearby area and asked what had happened the shaman that once lived in that lot and what happened to her building everyone told her that there was never a building there and that no such shaman or bruja lived around there. To this day she fears for her life and asks herself this question. "Who did I make a deal with, and what will they take as payment?"
