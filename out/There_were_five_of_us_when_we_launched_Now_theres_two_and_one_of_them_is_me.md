It was five of us in total. Me, Ty, Matt, Reese… and the pilot.

His name was Rick. Old guy, maybe late fifties. Worn-out hoodie, work boots laced to the ankle, didn’t say much beyond basic safety instructions. He met us in a clearing past the last subdivision—just this empty stretch of field that smelled like burned grass. No fences, no signs. The basket was already upright, balloon half-filled and swaying.

Ty booked the ride on a whim. Found it on some forum. Said it’d be about forty minutes in the air. “Sunset flight—smooth and scenic,” the post said. “Bring a jacket.” That was all.

We took off at around 7:15. Still light out, barely. The burner roared overhead, loud but somehow comforting, and the balloon rose clean—no lurch, no pull, just this silent lift that made the whole thing feel like a trick.

Rick barely looked at us once we were up. Just worked the burner and adjusted the cords while we passed over houses that looked like Monopoly pieces. The air felt thick with sun-warmed silence.

At first, it was fun. Ty cracked jokes. Matt was filming on his phone. Reese leaned over the edge more than I was comfortable with, spitting once just to see how long it took to disappear. I was quiet. Watching shadows crawl across the ground as the light slipped west.

It felt calm.

Until it didn’t.

I can’t say exactly when it changed. Maybe fifteen, twenty minutes in? The trees looked darker. Longer. The fields were endless. No more houses. No roads. Just an ocean of green that turned black the second the sun dropped below the hills.

I looked at Rick.

He was still standing with one hand on the burner valve, staring ahead, like he was waiting for something. His expression hadn’t changed since takeoff.

Ty asked, “How long until we come back down?”

No response.

Rick didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

Reese laughed nervously. “Hey, man. You good?”

Still nothing.

Matt reached out and touched his shoulder. Rick didn’t react. He was breathing, but stiff, frozen, like he’d fallen asleep with his eyes open.

The burner fired again. Flame roared above us.

We were still climbing.

I could feel it in my ears—pressure building. Wind had vanished. The trees were just a dark smear now. No lights below. No signs of life.

“I think we’re too high,” I said.

Reese stepped back from the edge. “I don’t see anything anymore. No town. No glow. Shouldn’t we be seeing, like… streetlights or something?”

Ty’s voice was tighter now. “What is this, man?”

Nobody had an answer.

Then Rick moved.

Not much. Just a shift in his weight. A small turn. His eyes scanned past us, not quite making contact. He let go of the burner. Walked to the edge of the basket.

No buildup. No words. No warning.

He climbed over the edge.

We all froze.

Ty grabbed the side. “Yo, yo, what the hell are you—”

But Rick was already halfway over. One leg dangling. Calm as anything.

And then he stepped off.

Gone.

No scream. No thud. No flutter of clothes. Just gone.

We rushed to the edge. Looked down.

Darkness.

At first, I thought I saw something—movement below. A shadow against shadows. Then Reese spoke, almost a whisper.

“There’s another one.”

“What?” Matt asked.

“Look.” He pointed.

Below us: another balloon.

Identical. Same striped envelope. Same wicker basket. Same shape.

Four figures inside. All standing. All looking up.

I followed Reese’s gaze upward.

Above us: another.

Same balloon. Four more figures. All facing down.

None of them moved.

The air got colder.

Matt stepped back, shaking his head. “What the fuck is this? What is this?”

Reese started pulling the emergency cord, over and over. Nothing happened.

“We’re not descending,” I said. “Why aren’t we going down?”

The burner hissed again.

Still climbing.

The four of us pressed in close now. No one talking. Just breathing harder, watching the balloons above and below like mirrors in the sky.

They weren’t reflections. They weren’t delayed. They weren’t random.

Each one of them was us.

Same heights. Same builds. Same silhouettes.

Matt spoke, voice tight. “That’s not possible. That’s not—”

“Shut up,” Ty said. “Just shut up for a second.”

The balloon above us was drifting lower. Slowly. Like it was being drawn to us.

I felt it first—a low shift in the air pressure, like something large was coming toward us without making a sound.

Then Reese stepped toward the edge.

Matt caught his arm. “Don’t.”

Reese didn’t look at him. Didn’t say anything.

He climbed up.

I moved to stop him too late.

He stepped over.

Just gone.

We rushed to the side. Balloon below: three figures now.

Ty started backing into the corner of the basket, staring at us, then down, then up again. His voice was cracking. “He’s down there. That’s him. That’s Reese down there.”

Matt was breathing heavy. “This isn’t real. This isn’t f—this isn’t real.”

I leaned back against the burner frame. My chest hurt. My fingers were numb.

Above us: the balloon was closer. Much closer.

I could make out details now—one of the figures was leaning forward. Elbows on the edge. Looking straight at me.

He didn’t blink.

I think he was me.

It’s just three of us now.

Me, Ty, and Matt.

Reese is gone. Rick too. The balloon keeps climbing.

The one above is maybe fifty feet away now. I can see its stripes more clearly—red, yellow, and dark green, like ours. The envelope flickers softly in the moonless dark, almost glowing from the heat of its own burner.

And the people inside… they don’t move. They just stare.

I tried yelling. Nothing. No reaction.

Ty won’t stop whispering. It’s like he’s talking to himself, but low and fast like he doesn’t want us to hear.

“I saw his jacket,” he says. “Reese. He’s wearing his jacket down there.”

Matt finally snaps. “We don’t know that. You didn’t see anything.”

“I did,” Ty hisses, loud now. “You just don’t want to believe it!”

They start arguing. I can’t follow it. I’m focused on the horizon—if there even is one. It’s all black now. The air’s thin. Cold. My skin feels dry, like my body’s trying to shrink itself.

And then I see the lights.

Just three, out in the dark below us.

A faint glow, barely visible at first. Then clearer.

A barn, wide and sagging in the middle. One side caved in.
A factory, windowless except one tall smokestack with a faint flickering light behind a window near the roof.
A church, long and narrow, crooked spire pointing into the void.

We pass over them.

“Did you see that?” I ask.

Matt nods. “Yeah.”

Ty doesn’t answer. He’s still pacing, arms crossed tight across his chest. His lips are moving but he isn’t saying anything out loud anymore.

Five minutes pass. Maybe ten.

And then the buildings come back.

Same exact ones. Same broken barn. Same crooked spire. Same flickering factory window.

“Okay,” Matt mutters. “That’s not possible. That’s not—”

“I counted the shingles,” I whisper. “It’s the same barn.”

Ty’s in the corner, knees pulled to his chest now.

We drift in silence. The burner fires again.

And now I realize something worse. We’re not just drifting past the buildings.

We’re stuck on them.

A loop.

Like a cheap simulation. Like the world below is just wallpaper. The same strip of terrain playing again and again.

“Where the hell are we?” Matt whispers.

No one answers.

The balloon above—closer now. I can see the face of the one leaning over.

He’s got my build. My shoulders. His head tilts slightly when I move. Like a reflection that’s lagging.

Then Matt goes still.

His eyes are fixed on something behind me.

“Someone’s coming down.”

I turn.

From the balloon above—one figure is climbing.

Hand over hand, slow, down the rope netting. Legs swinging slightly with the breeze. Steady. No fear in how he moves. Like he knows exactly where he’s going.

I take a step back, heart thudding hard enough to hurt.

Ty starts rocking now, mumbling something rhythmically, faster and faster.

Matt stares at the climbing figure like he’s frozen.

And then Matt bolts.

He doesn’t say a word. Just runs at the edge and jumps.

He doesn’t hesitate. Doesn’t cry out.

Gone.

I spin and grab the side. Balloon below: two figures now.

Me and Ty.

I stagger back. My breathing’s too fast. I feel like my body’s turning inside out.

The figure from above is almost here.

I can hear the soft creak of the rope ladder now. The wooden clunk of his foot landing on the basket.

I don’t want to look.

But I do.

He stands a few feet away. Same height. Same jacket. Same hands. Face in shadow, but I know—I know—it’s me.

He just stares. Tilts his head. Then tilts it back the other way.

Not mocking. Not curious.

Just… copying.

Ty finally screams.

It’s sudden and raw and loud in the dead air.

He jumps to his feet and points.

“There’s more!” he yells.

I look over.

The balloon below? It’s no longer just one.

There are two.

Stacked. Slightly offset.

Both rising.

And above us—another has appeared. Higher still.

I don’t understand.

It’s not just one above and one below anymore.

It’s layers.

Dozens of them.

Going up.

Going down.

Some of them have baskets filled with people. Some have none.

Some have me.

The one in our basket hasn’t moved. Still staring. Still watching.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.

Ty backs away, arms trembling.

Then he grabs the burner valve and yanks it.

The flame shoots up with a scream of gas.

He pulls again. And again. No control. Just panic.

“We have to get out,” he mutters. “It’s gonna keep going. It doesn’t end.”

I shout at him, but it’s no use. He’s lost in it.

He steps to the edge. One foot over.

“No, Ty—!”

He looks at me once. Just once.

Then he falls backward into the dark.

The balloon below—just one figure now.

Me.

And the other.

He’s still staring.

We’re both standing here. In the same basket.

The burner cuts off.

No flame.

No sound.

No movement.

We just float.

Above and below—copies of us.

I sit down slowly, staring into the black.

Then I hear the wind shift. Just a little.

The copy of me walks over.

And sits beside me.

Not touching.

Just… sitting.

We stare out together at the horizon, where the barn, the factory, and the church repeat again for the fifth time.

I’m not sure which one of us is the real me anymore.

I’ve been writing this for a dozen or so cycles now. If you can see this, my phone now has reception, and you know what I’ve had to do.
