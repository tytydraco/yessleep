My name is Johnathan, surname is unimportant. I'm a ritual hobbyist and I’ve just stumbled upon my first real ritual. 

I don’t know where to start off but I think the beginning will work. I'm a guy who grew up watching shows like Charmed and supernatural. Goosebumps books were too scary to me but ritualistic magic that required a clear process always drew me in.  Whether its the way that the rules would build onto each other symbolically that would make sense for the final result or the way it made the unknown feel mundane and controllable. The way these rituals worked just somehow managed to somehow always pull me in.

Now that I've sufficiently convinced you that I'm off my rocker; I do want to reassure to you that despite my enthusiasm for the subject. Deep down I was always a skeptic. As much as I wanted to believe in something greater than the surface level of the world that I could see and touch. Without proof I just couldn't give my full faith to it. 

That being said, I still carried it on as a hobby. Popular rituals I could find on message boards like this, rituals that started at school, rituals featured in shows like charmed raised me. 
Regardless of my beliefs I could still pour hours of my day at home on a school weekend trying to piece together the imaginary significance of a witches divinations on charmed or Knock Knock Mary rose on no sleep. 

My friends back then said I just had some form of kink in the brain/ a bit of autism for a lack of the literal words they used to say it to me. But nevertheless I couldnt stop whether or not I believed in it in a real sense,  my love for the process truly wholly true. 

thats being said I disdained my other occultist hobbyists. The community as a whole never appealed to me, most occulstists after all were teenagers with latent mental issues who wanted to hurt people or themselves for some chicken god of the east or fanatics who fully believed in serving a hidden higher power or requesting that power to things for them. the latter type personally made me hate the idea of being put under the same umbrella . Something about the idea of someone who fully believes in the hidden world right beneath our eyes and thinks to prostrate themselves before these unknowable forces instead of making efforts to navigate and manipulate possibly even becoming these forces strikes antagonistically with my views

I went on a bit of a tangent here but im hoping this will make my actions from here on out make more some sense.


like all stories , it was a normal afternoon. I'd been spending my day as usual scrolling on forums for stories and rituals  I hadn't seen before. eventually I made my way to the nosleep sub reddit and found a post that caught my eye.  its name was "rituals of power no.4: The longing" , a simple name but looking enough name considering the forum I was on but still it drew me in. After clicking on the post I noticed in surprise that the post was immediately all available to me . If this was a normal no sleep post then this would be a very short story . Instinctually fearing that the supposed gem I found was just a short nothing burger of a story that has a cheesy twist ending , I skimmed the story once over. In that skimming I realized two things.
1. Was that this was exactly what I was looking for.
2. This post would be removed soon. 

If you are aware of the rules of the nosleep subreddit then you are aware that there has to be a story for how some horrifying events have happened in someones life. the story has to include a reasonable way for the person telling the story to upload it on the nosleep sub Reddit. And a bunch of other obligatory context stuff that you need to meet the requirements to post on the subreddit.

 The short and narrow of it is that you can't just upload a set of instructions like the post I found just did. 

This was both a blessing and curse. It meant that I found a mysterious set of instructions where they shouldn’t have been. But it also meant that I wouldn’t be able to read rituals of power no.1-3 since it was likely taken down by the moderators on the sight. Just to confirm so , I first copied over the ritual instructions into my folder of rituals in my pc that catch my eye. Once I’d made sure that there wasn’t any chance of losing what I had found with an accidental page refresh, I went on to check out the poster. To my dismay it was one of those random anonymous accounts that were blank, expected but still unfortunate. The only post that showed on this mysterious author’s page being the post I found them with. 

Cutting my losses I decided to enjoy what I did have and finally focused on the post . 
And Although this sounds cliché,  I feel obligated as the narrator of my own story to say,

“even though I wouldn’t know it at the time, everything was about to change.”

Now that I had the new story, I decided to read over it. My earlier skim let me see little of what the actual ritual was about , so you can imagine my surprise when the first thing was a prerequisite: 

////-
“ A longtime obsession you've reached a degree of  achievement in coming to reach.”
////-

If I wasn’t already drawn fully in by the nature of this post then I would be after reading this. Seeing ritual instructions that took themselves so seriously that they had prerequisites stoked the flames of obsession. My craft had been acknowledged , my corner of the universe was being taken seriously ! 

From then on I devoured the rest of the text, I didn’t really even need to consider my next actions . I knew right then and there that I was performing this ritual.
Something I hadn’t done in a while but this ritual brought it out of me.

I’ve been trying to decide how to tell what happened, whether to share the ritual first and then explain what I did , or explaining the ritual along with what I did. Im choosing the latter because I think it’ll make it easier to follow along, im not really a writer so I worry about the composition.I will denote breaks between the pasted source material and my actual actions like this .

////////////
Ritual says to do this.
///////////
 I do this .
 
With that being said . Here is my experience performing and failing the rituals of power no.4: The longing.

///////////-

ritual prerequisites: a longtime obsession you've reached a degree of  achievement in coming to reach.

the longer you've held this obsession, the harder the obsession is to reach, and the closer you are to reaching the goal of your obsession without ever actually coming in contact with it. The better your chances of success.
for reference- records of the shortest successful obsession used was an obsession born and longed for approximately 3 years long.

Note: the more valuable the obsession is widely considered the better chances of success in the further steps.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You must take yourself to any location you feel familiar with and capable of moving around.

being familiar with your area of choice is technically not a requirement but it helps you with later steps.

Step 1.
 write a letter of longing for your obsession. 
The letter can be in almost any structure and language so long as you clearly state your longing and pursuit of the obsession. label the sender as your true name and the receiver as your obsession.
//////////-

The instructions were such that I didn’t really need much preparation. I live in a college town that I am pretty familiar with seeing as I lived here so I decided I didn’t need to go out of my way to move .So with that I decided to just stay in my apartment.

The obsession I decided to use was my degree in computer science I had been working towards for about 3 years.  It felt like it fit the script and , there was secondary reason that rang in the back of my mind that I am not sure if I should even say at all but just for full transparency sake I’ll elaborate on it. It felt dangerous to use something that I really cared about , like love, or even my obsession with rituals ; The instructions said the longer I’ve harbored the obsession the better my chances of success but at the same time I felt hesitant when I thought about using those, it felt like I was wagering something I shouldn’t so I decided to go with something I could see myself living without. The degree was truly just so I could be a little more confident in my future financial prospects which I felt more comfortable using .

The instructions came with an example note that I used as a frame for my words. I don’t have the note for reasons I’ll explain later but it went something like this.

dear degree I’ve been working towards
I wish for you to know my endless longing to meet you. It's been years yet it feels like I'm never any closer.  I will be reaching you soon though. Please take care, until next time my beloved.

sincerely Johnathon (my last name).

I can’t lie to you . If it wasn’t for the fervor flowing through my veins as I wrote that note I would have been hacking up blood from my vocal chords with how much I would have been laughing but during the time I was entirely serious writing my note.

///////-

Spending time around your note will increase the chance of success later. It is advised to pursue your obsession while in the presence of the note to help increase your connection to it that would've been established with your heartfelt letter to your obsession.

once you have your letter release it. Close your eyes and count to three. If your note is still there it means your ritual has failed on one of the prerequisite necessities. If it is gone then your letter has been received. 
(It is advised to carry out the previous step alone to avoid any confusion on whether your letter was just taken away by a random bystander)

//////-

Truth be told. I had no intentions on waiting. Fervor can only last so long and I was never the type to have patience. That being said I did try to convince  myself to do some homework while In the presence of my note but it didn’t last for more than 15 minutes before I got impatient; hindsight would tell me that the letter was measuring time in days and my little 15 minute charade probably did me no favors at all. 

It should also be noted that I was doing this with the sole purpose of going through the motions . My actions up until now were all predicated on the idea that what I was doing was fake. I was just a fanatic plunging himself into his delusional daydreams.

I set the note right in front of me, the note said in its side notes the act of releasing could be in any way shape or form so long as I recognized it as releasing. I even dimmed my lamp next to my bedside to get into the mood . And like the ritual said, I closed my eyes and counted to three.

One
Two
Three

I opened my eyes returning my sight to the spot where my note should have still been. Now, there aren’t words that I can say to describe the feeling in that moment  of what I am sure you are prepared to read. 

I monologued a lot during the telling of this story and I’ll have to ask you to bear with me one more time. When this happened I didn’t feel vindicated , I didn’t feel amazed, I didn’t feel joy or passion from my hobby. Nothing else was there except the cold plunge of the reality that I just voluntarily stepped into. The fear of entering a world that I wasn’t familiar with. I can tell you right now the reason I am writing this on this forum is because I don’t believe you’ll believe me, despite me writing this I don’t believe you’ll go through with the ritual and check and see if what i am saying is true. Truth is , I feel greedy and afraid; I want this to myself but at the same time I want to scream and tell someone who can wrap me in restraints. I’ve never felt so conflicted in my life and the best or worse part is that I don’t know what comes next.


Back to the story. 

The note was gone. 20 minutes, for 20 minutes I searched everywhere I knew where it wouldn’t be in my home. Fear and excitement worked in tandem and I felt every moment of it like pins and needles through my skin. I remember sitting on the floor of my bathroom after spilling the guts of my the bathroom sink’s  under cabinet onto the floor around me. I remember looking up at the glass mirror that still reflected my computer screen. The same screen that held my personal copy . The same screen that was stuck on part 2 of the ritual. 


Listen I’ve written a-lot here and I’m not really a big writer at my core. This was just something made in an emotional frenzy I think I need to relax. I’ll tell the rest of the story later . I just need some time to get myself together. I just lost all progress in my degree among other things so if you will excuse me . 

I’ll be in the comments after if there are any questions.  Thank you for your time.
