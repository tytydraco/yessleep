Their courses used to be available back in the day and 100% free. Anyway could just stumble upon a flyer, their one and only method of advertising, place an order via a certain email that no longer exists nowadays, and receive a free VHS or DVD of the requested course, depending on the era. I remember that there were 3 sections advertised only at the beginning of a course, which are the Adults, Teens and Kids sections. The available courses I still remember seeing are: Music, Dancing & Physical Education, Acting, Drawing & Design, Literature & Grammar, Algebra & Geometry, Programming & Cybersecurity, Chemistry, Physics, Nutrition and many more, all of them supposedly taught by the same tutor, who is only known as Mosradael. Today, there are no traces of the media formats, but the video courses would just pop up randomly according to search results, uploaded by a nameless channel with no profile picture, that was the case for me at least. The videos themselves would have random yet decent number of views but with 0 likes, dislikes and comments.

My name is Holgha. I am here to be a voice for myself and the 2 other names I have for you: Betty and Keiko, 2 beautiful souls that are no longer among us to speak for themselves, so I will do it for them, reporting facts obtained from relatives and close acquaintances.

Victim: Betty (1990 - 1997)

Course: Music (Piano Lessons)

Year: 1997

Please allow me to start with the case that break my heart the most, so that I can find the strength to continue with the rest. This is the tragic story of little Betty. Since her very early years, Betty always displayed a real fascination and attraction for music and musical instruments, with her two favorites being the flute and the piano. It is unclear how her parents saw the flyer from the Mosradael Learning Academy but they ordered a piano course and received a VHS shortly after. They never saw who delivered the package. Big mistake. According to my source, one of her relatives, the tutor, Mosradael on the tape was a slightly older boy apparently from Spain of maybe 13 years old, thus getting Betty more excited and comfortable for the learning process.

The first sessions went well to the point that Betty's parents would grant her the privacy to learn alone, in her room, with her own TV, player and piano. However, things started to get concerning when her parents would hear her and also find her learning and playing at odd hours, from 2am to 5am for example. Betty started sleeping during classes and skipping school, strangely obsessed about her piano lessons that it seemed nothing else mattered for her. Soon, it became clear that there was a song, the only song she would play each time she could, or hum or sing when she could not play, and she would as well do it at odd hours. Her parents decided to stop the piano lessons and confiscated the VHS tape and the piano for her own good. Despite those measures, she would still wake up in the middle of the night to hum or sing the song plunging her parents into despair, before proceeding to harass her parents during the day so that they release the VHS and the piano. Her parents sent complaints to the academy through their email to no avail.

One night, her parents found Betty apparently sleepwalking, and trying with her eyes closed to open the room where the piano and the VHS were locked away, while calmly humming the song. Her mother wanted to shake her but the father stopped his wife, curious about what was occurring. Betty then stopped everything all of a sudden, standing still in front of the door for at least 10 minutes. When the parents decided that it was enough and they made the first steps towards their daughter, Betty used her right hand to push the door and it violently shattered into pieces, allowing her to enter the room. When her parents shook her, she screamed and fought them as if she was afraid of them. 

The same day, at around 11am, Betty's parents contacted a child psychologist who was on her way to attend to the little girl. Meanwhile, they let Betty learn and play in her room, to appease her and also to allow the psychologist to see the circumstances for herself. They heard her play the song, again and again, until the psychologist arrived and she also, along with the parents, heard the melody and went to Betty's door. However, the moment they opened the door, Betty, the VHS tape and even the flyer were gone, leaving behind the piano, the player and the television on static, and especially distraught parents who for the rest of their lives have been crushed by their loss. To add more to the torture, they would sometimes hear someone playing the song on the piano locked in her room but the moment they open the door, everything would stop. They eventually had to break and throw the piano away. You cannot see me typing this, but maybe through my words you can feel the tears that I shed. For crying out loud, she was only 7 years old! Seven! But— okay, what can be done at this point?

Victim: Keiko (1989 - 2014)

Course: Drawing & Design

Year: 2014

Keiko was a bubbly woman filled with a passion for art and crafts. Around the 2010s, the world was really buzzing with everything art and design and Keiko wanted to take her passion to the virtual realm as she felt that her culture has design wealth that could largely contribute to the movement. According to her husband at the time, she found the course randomly on a video platform and decided to explore. Once again, big mistake. According to him, the tutor Mosradael seemed to be a young man of around their age and from the West.

As usual, the first sessions were okay. Keiko retrieved the video each time she needed to from the browser history as even keywords would not work in the search bar but she dismissed it. She followed instructions, bought a drawing book and pencils to practice on paper before moving things to the screen. She was very happy about the lessons and the designs that she painted some of them on several doors of their house. Soon, they started to hear strange knocks on the doors, at various times during the day or the night, only to verify and see that nobody was behind the doors or in the rooms. Sometimes, they would open a door, expecting to see the bathroom but would see the living room instead and mysteriously find themselves there, holding the door. One time, their baby crawled through a door and disappeared for at least 24 minutes before reappearing through another one completely and fortunately unharmed. Keiko would be the recipient of horrible nightmares in which the doors would open and let strange beasts invade their home and rip them apart. She would also sleepwalk, and draw strange symbols on the walls or in her drawing book, effectively intensifying the bizarre occurrences in the house.

The day they decided to leave that house, Keiko went back in to fetch something and never came back out. When her husband went to look for her, he saw the symbols on the walls and doors emit a strange light and catch fire so vividly that it burned down the whole house. At the same time, Keiko's computer and her sketchbook also caught fire and were destroyed totally. She was never found and left behind a grieving husband and their little son.

Victim: Holgha (2001 - 20??)

Course: Dancing & Physical Education

Year: 2024

I have always been a dancing addict. People know me for not being able to stay still. It does not matter if it is out of joy or to let any negative feeling out or to get my mind off things, I have to dance. I explored many genres from different parts of the world and it is with the intention of discovering new ones that I made a search on the Web and stumbled upon a free course from that— academy and unfortunately took it. Monumental mistake. Mind you, at that point in February, I did not know anything about Betty, Keiko or any other person who unfortunately interacted with the academy. Mosradael on the video I clicked on, was a young Asian woman of around my age and she introduced me to new dances she claimed existed before the year 700. I found it interesting and imagined how I could merge the very old and the very new to create something unique.

The first lesson did not really impress me to be honest, and since it was just some free and random video on the Web, I did not really want to continue but, I somehow felt compelled to come back, again, and again, and again. Soon, I was deep inside the course, and the movements were getting harder to learn and reproduce but I was slowly getting there. One day, the tutor taught me how to prepare a certain mixture that was key to the next level. I blindly followed the instructions and applied it on specific parts of my body before proceeding with the dance session. The mixture dried up, almost like sunk inside my skin as soon as I started the video and for once, I was really dancing and reproducing all the moves with strange ease. Soon however, I realised that I was no longer in control. I could see, I could hear, I could feel, I could not open my mouth so I could not scream or call for help, I could not stop, so I danced all around the room, gracefully without knocking anything off, for hours. My phone rang at some point but I could not pick up, my feet and knees turned red because of the atrocious pain, I cried and growled in agony, suffering and dancing. Meanwhile, the screen of my computer was flashing strange symbols and at some point, the tutor, Mosradael interrupted the piano music which made me freeze but I was not released, instead, I was standing on a toe, kept still in an unnatural position and by a supernatural force.

"Rejoice, rejoice daughter of mine. You have found your way to a new life that shall never end..." She said, speaking slowly with an unnatural growling voice, and smiling so eerily that I could not really pay attention to the rest of her speech, also due to the unbearable pain. As soon as she stopped, the piano music and the dancing resumed. I was a prisoner in my own body.

One of my friends came to the door, then to my window, seeing my shadow. She banged on the window and even called me on the phone but ended up leaving in anger, as she thought that I was ignoring her. It is only when she came back later during the night with another friend, that they understood that something was wrong. They broke the door and saw me crying and dancing, prompting them to stop the music. I immediately crumbled on the floor and burst into tears before being rushed to the hospital. 

It was not the end of it of course. The video is gone, even in the browser history. The only people that can attest of its existence are the friends that rescued me. However, Mosradael still haunts me to this day. I can hear that voice in my head, even the piano song, and sometimes, I start dancing randomly out of control and no matter where I am or what time it is. It has put me in troubles and in danger severally. My relatives and friends are thinking of sending me to a psychiatric facility, and I believe this is where I will disappear and/or die like Betty and Keiko. 

About Keiko, do you remember me telling you that I did not know anything about Mosradael before being one of the victims? Well, it is only after doing my research that I noticed something strange. I once asked her husband if he could send me a picture of her and almost jumped out of my window when he sent it through email. Mosradael on the video I watched was Keiko. Is it what that thing does? Will my appearance be used as Mosradael for the next victim? I hope not.

I have received other emails of people claiming to have relatives that fell victim to Mosradael. One family from Spain, said that they had a young cousin, Francisco, who was 13 years old when he was trying to study Chemistry through a free and strange VHS tape in 1991. His experiment killed his whole family including himself. They were found chanting strange incantations with their eyes rolled, after inhaling a bizarre orange smoke, and all died on their way to the hospital. I do not think I have enough time left to do research and report on that, they will have to continue without me.

Are we safe in this world? How somebody can just apply for a job, go to an interview and never return? How can someone go to a date trying to find love and find death? How can someone visits a house for rent and end up being a permanent resident, killed and buried under concrete? We only wanted to learn, was it a crime or too much to ask? Is it so easy to lose a life in this world? Well, this is Holgha reporting, and hoping to be the last victim of that entity. Please be careful, always.

To the beautiful souls we loved and unfortunately lost.
