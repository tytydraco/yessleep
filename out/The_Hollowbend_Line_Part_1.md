Before I get into the story, I should explain why I’ve never talked about it until now. What happened took place years ago, and for reasons I can’t fully explain, I couldn’t tell anyone. It wasn’t just fear, though there was plenty of that. It was more like, if I spoke about it, I might ruin something I wasn’t supposed to touch.

But lately, keeping quiet feels heavier than telling it. I’ve carried it long enough. So this is my account, exactly as I remember it.

“I feel like we should’ve packed warmer clothes. It’s freezing out here,” I muttered, wishing I had a jacket to wrap tight around me.

Just minutes ago, the weather had been sunny and pleasant. Then, without warning, a fog rolled in. Thick, heavy and swallowing the landscape whole. The temperature plummeted so fast it was like we’d stepped into another season. A fine mist clung to everything, beading on our hair, our clothes, the metal rail we perched on. The warmth was gone, replaced by a creeping cold that seemed to seep straight into my bones.

“Do you think a train will come through?” I asked, watching my breath curl into the mist like smoke. The tracks stretched ahead in both directions, vanishing into the pale curtain of fog.

Grace shook her head slowly, unfazed. “Doubt it. These tracks haven’t seen a train in decades. The town they used to connect to was abandoned sometime in the ’90s. My dad said the whole place just sort of… died.”

She fished a cigarette from the crumpled pack in her pocket and lit it with a practised flick. For a second, the lighter’s flame carved her face in sharp relief, highlighting her cheekbones, the slope of her nose, before it vanished again into the gloom. The ember glowed faintly at the tip as she drew in a breath, then dulled as she exhaled a soft stream of smoke that mingled with the mist.

I glanced around, trying to find some kind of landmark, something familiar. All I saw was fog. A faint hiss of drizzle met the gravel at our feet, and somewhere in the distance came a hollow echo, too far away to name, too close to ignore.

We sat in silence, the quiet stretching until it felt heavier than the fog itself.

“So, why bring me out here?” I finally asked, my voice low.

“I told you.” She exhaled another ribbon of smoke, her words drifting along with it. “My parents grew up there. They left just before things went bad. I just wanted to see my parents’ hometown.”

I frowned. “Yeah, but why bring **me**?”

“Because all my other friends are interstate. You’re the closest.” She said it flatly, firmly, like there was nothing more to explain.

I opened my mouth to argue, then shut it again.

“We should’ve driven,” I muttered instead. “Do we even have service out here?”

“Dude, can you shut up and just be a good friend?” Grace shot me a look, equal parts exasperation and amusement. She wasn’t wrong. This trip mattered to her, and I was turning it into a checklist of complaints. So, I shut my mouth and nodded.

She finished her cigarette down to the filter, crushed it against the gravel with the toe of her Converse, and stood abruptly. “C’mon. We should get there soon so we’re not walking back in the dark.”

“This is why we should’ve driven,” I grumbled, pushing myself off the rail.

“Don’t be stupid. The roads are blocked off. Do you think your poor Barina, or my poor Laser, could possibly survive off-road?” She raised her eyebrows, daring me to answer.

I pictured our sad little cars bogged down in mud, bumpers scraping over rocks, wheels spinning uselessly. The image made me grin despite myself. She was right. I was being stupid.

“Fine,” I said, adjusting my bag. “Lead the way.”

And with that, we set off down the tracks, into the fog, heading toward the town I already wished we’d never decided to find.

 

We kept walking for another twenty minutes, half of it in silence, half of it filled with the kind of useless bullshit we found entertaining.

Grace and I had been friends for a few years. I still remember the first time I met her. We initially met in a film class at university during one of those forced group projects they make you do. I don’t even remember what the project was about, but I remember the conversations we had. I’d never really been great at making friends, so I was at a loss for words, but she always seemed to know what to say, always had an answer ready.

That first day, I asked her what her favourite movie was. It was supposed to be an icebreaker, but she didn’t answer right away. She tilted her head, like the question was more complicated than I’d meant it to be.

“I don’t know, dude, that’s a hard question. Like, how could I even begin? All art is a conversation, and to say a film is better than another is to ignore that conversation entirely. Like how Michael Haneke’s *Funny Games* is a clear response to the 80s slasher craze, or how *Vertigo* twists the whole detective-thriller formula back on itself, y’know?”

I just stared at her for a second, dumbfounded. She’d always been smarter than me, or at least knew how to sound like it.

She shrugged, as if aware she’d lost me. “But if I had to pick? *The Holy Mountain.*” A small smile tugged at her lips, half-proud, half-daring me to call her pretentious. “How about you?”

I cleared my throat, suddenly aware of how average I sounded next to her. “Uh… probably *Spider-Man 2.*”

Her grin broke wide, and just like that, we’d talked for hours.



I found myself glancing sideways at her, that same grin flickering in my memory. Grace always had a way of making things bigger than they seemed. She

“What do you think, uh, what’s the town called?” I stumbled

“Hollowbend, I told you like five times.” She said, half annoyed,

“Right, Hollowbend. Anyway, what do you think the state we’ll find it in will be?”

“I don’t know. Probably overgrown, smashed windows, graffiti. The same state you find in all abandoned places.”

A shadow moved in the fog ahead, tall and thin, or maybe it was just a tree twisted against the mist. My stomach tightened. “That… that looks like a building.”

Grace squinted. “Finally. You’re catching on. That’s probably the old general store. I don’t think Hollowbend had much else besides that and the church.”

As we drew closer, the outlines became clearer: a single-story wooden building, paint peeling in strips, windows caked with grime. One of the panes had a jagged hole, and through it, darkness stared back at us. A sudden scuttle of something small, rats, maybe, made me jump. On the notice board out front was a map of the town dated from the late 60s. Some residential areas down the road, the church, the store and a few extra buildings. It was about as big as she said.

“See?” Grace said softly, almost to herself. “Everything’s exactly as it should be. Like frozen in time.”

“Some Silent Hill type shit,” I muttered.

We lingered at the threshold, hesitant. The door hung crooked on its hinges. I could see the faint outline of shelves inside, dusty and bare, a spider web stretched across a forgotten corner. My heart beat a little faster.

“Ladies first,”

“Pussy.”

“Hey man, I just think this is a bit creepy,” I said defensively.

Rolling her eyes, she pushed on the door. It creaked and came half off its hinges, groaning like it hadn’t been touched in decades. Grace stepped inside, and I followed reluctantly.

The air smelled sour. Rot and mildew. Dust clung to every surface. Shelves stood half-collapsed, their contents scattered across the floor. Behind the counter, cash drawers hung open, coins dulled with grime. What was left of fruit and vegetables lay in blackened heaps, alive with maggots and ants.

“Great first impression,” I muttered.

Grace smirked. “Maybe there’s more in the manager’s office.”

We edged toward the back. Each step stirred the silence, our shoes crunching on broken glass and warped floorboards. Grace pushed on the door.

“Help, it’s stuck.”

Together, we rammed into the door with our shoulders, which tore the door off the wall.

“What the fuck?”

The manager’s office wasn’t an office at all. The room was bare. no desk, no shelves, not even dust. Just a single structure in the centre: three walls, a low roof, and a stairwell that descended into darkness.

The office was as large as the entire shopfront we’d just walked through. From the outside, the building wasn’t nearly big enough to hold both spaces. It was like the store had doubled on the inside.

Grace stepped forward, her voice hushed, almost reverent. “This… this isn’t possible.”

I swallowed hard, staring at the stairwell. Grace took a step forward.

“We shouldn’t-” I started, but she cut me off with a single look.

“Marc.”

“Fuck me.”

We made our descent.

 

The deeper we went, the more the dark closed around us. Our phone torches cut thin beams into the black, but it was like shining light into ink; the glow barely reached the next step ahead. Every breath felt swallowed, every sound dulled. It wasn’t just dark. It was a kind of dark that ate the light whole. Ten steps. Fifteen. The rectangle of light above us vanished, swallowed whole. I looked back, but the doorway was gone. Just black.

“Grace…” My voice cracked. “I don’t think this staircase ends.”

“Don’t be dramatic,” she shot back, but I heard the strain in her voice.

The stairs kept going, a twisting descent into a silence that felt heavier than the damp air. My phone, held in a trembling hand, showed no change in temperature, but my breath still fogged in the oppressive gloom. Each step on the slick stone was a small, echoing sound that was immediately swallowed by the profound darkness. Twenty steps became thirty, then fifty, and I felt a dizzying sense that we weren't just going down, but folding inward, pulled by some unseen force deeper than should be possible.

Grace's silence was more unnerving than any complaint I could have made. She kept her torch fixed on the steps ahead, her face a mask of fierce concentration. This was her mission, and a part of me felt like she was a sleepwalker on a path only she could see. When the stairs finally ended, they didn’t lead to another hallway or room, but to a massive, metal door. It was rusted and pitted, with a heavy, circular handle. We shared a look, a silent agreement that there was no turning back now.

"Ready?" I whispered, my voice a dry rasp.

She didn't answer, just grabbed the handle and braced herself. I put my shoulder against the cold metal, and together we pulled. The door groaned, a terrible, scraping shriek of protest that seemed to tear through the solid rock around us. As it slowly opened, a light escaped, casting a pale glow on the stairwell.

We squeezed through the narrow opening. Instead of a dusty cellar or another derelict room, we stood in a clean, albeit unorganised, office. Sitting at a desk, looking over some paperwork, caught up in thought, was a balding man, maybe in his 40s.

"Hello?" I let out after a few seconds.

The man jumped slightly, clearly startled. He looked up, his eyes wide behind his glasses. He seemed to take in our muddy shoes and wind-whipped hair before his gaze landed on the gaping hole where the door had been.

"Who the hell are you guys?" he asked, his voice a tight coil of anger and confusion. "What are you doing here? Customers aren't supposed to be back here."

We just stared at him, unable to form a coherent response. The sheer normalcy of the man was more unsettling than some faceless figure I’d conjured in my mind. He wore a simple button-up shirt and khakis, and the desk was littered with pens and half-empty coffee mugs. The only thing out of place was… us.

"We… uh… we just followed the stairs," Grace finally managed to stammer, her voice a reedy whisper.

The man looked with a mix of frustration and confusion and ran a hand through the small amount of his hair. "The stairs? Right, look, whatever you're doing, you need to leave.”

I turned to look behind us. My heart lurched. Where the heavy steel door had stood was now just a broom closet.

“Where are we?” I blurted.

The man looked at me like I was simple. “You’re in my office. Hollowbend General Store. And you’re not supposed to be here.” He tapped his papers. “Now, please. My schedule’s full until ’93.”

My stomach dropped. I turned to Grace, who looked pale, her face a mixture of disbelief and horror.

She cleared her throat. “Sir… what year is it?”

He stared at her, a look of complete bewilderment on his face. "It's **1992**. October. Are you two alright? You seem a little out of sorts. Is the heat getting to you?"

A cold, internal dread settled in the pit of my stomach. "No, we're fine, just a bit unsettled. We'll leave you in peace," I said, gently pushing Grace toward the door.

"Wait."

We stopped and turned back to face him. He opened a desk drawer, pulled out two plastic water bottles, and tossed them to us. "Stay hydrated, guys."

"Thanks," we said in unison.

We walked through the general store, now transformed into a nice, cleaned-up grocery instead of the forgotten shell we saw previously. Leaving through the front, revealing a vibrant street scene. The view was pristine and alive with people. A postman in a neat uniform walking down the street, kids on bicycles, and a few old Holden cars parked along the curb. The harsh sunlight, warm and bright, was a stark contrast to the unnatural grey mist that had just swallowed us. A man sweeping his driveway gave us a wave.

“Morning, folks! Lovely day for a visit, isn’t it?” His voice carried the warmth of a sitcom dad, and yet the way his eyes locked on us made my chest tighten.

Grace nodded politely. “Yeah. Lovely day.”

We walked on. At the corner stood the general store, bright and clean, nothing like the ruin we’d first stepped into. Its big window gleamed, and a neat poster announced *Fresh Bread Every Morning!* Behind the glass, I could see the same man from the office, head bent over his papers again, exactly as we’d left him.

Across the street, a woman in an apron leaned from a bakery window. “You must be new in town!” she called, her voice as cheerful as a song. Her flour-dusted hands waved as if she’d been expecting us.

Grace offered a thin smile. “Just visiting.”

“Oh, visitors!” The woman clapped her hands. “How exciting! You’ll love Hollowbend. We always take care of our own here.” She said it so warmly that it almost felt like a promise.

At the corner stood a diner, its neon sign buzzing faintly: **The Hollowbelly.** Through the window, we saw people laughing, eating, and talking, yet not a single sound leaked out. The silence felt unnatural. But when the door opened, the noise hit all at once, as if the laughter and chatter had been bottled up and unleashed.

“Coffee?” a waitress asked the moment we sat at the counter. Her voice carried a broad rural country lilt; the vowels stretched just a bit too wide. She was tall, her beehive hairdo flawless, her uniform spotless. Her nametag read **BETTY**, though the letters were worn almost to nothing.

“Uh… sure,” I said.

She poured without looking at the cup, and not a drop spilled.

Grace tilted her head at the counter around us. “Huh. It’s like one of those 50s diners from old movies.”

“I’ll tell you what, though,” I said, gulping down the drink. “This is a damn good cup of coffee.”

Grace didn’t answer. Her cup sat untouched, steam curling up, until the curl slowed, then froze in mid-air, hanging motionless like a painted line.

“Marc,” she whispered, her grip tightening on my hand. “I think we shouldn’t have come here.”

“I hate to be a smart ass, but it was you who kept pushing for us to keep going,” I said, sipping again.

“Yeah, but I didn’t think we’d get stuck here.”

Grace’s eyes locked on her cup, lips pressed to a thin line. Behind the counter, Betty polished a glass with a rag that never seemed to get damp, her movements slow, circular, hypnotic.

“You don’t like it?” Betty asked suddenly, her eyes flicking to Grace’s untouched drink.

Grace flinched. “Oh, no, it’s fine. I’m just… not thirsty.”

“If you don’t mind, then,” I slid her cup over to me.

Betty let out a soft laugh. “My, I don’t think I’ve seen anyone like the coffee nearly as much as you.” She kept smiling, as if waiting for me to agree with her.

I chuckled awkwardly. “Guess I’m just a coffee guy.”

“That’s good,” Betty said, nodding too quickly. “Good to know.” She jotted something down on her order pad, though we hadn’t asked for anything else.

A man in overalls shuffled past our stools and took a seat two spots down. He turned toward us immediately, grinning as if we were old friends.

“You two married?” he asked.

Grace blinked. “Uh… no.”

“Shame,” he said, still smiling. “You look married.” He reached for the sugar jar, though he didn’t have a coffee.

Betty leaned across the counter, cheerful as ever. “They just got here, Frank. Don’t scare them off.”

“Not scaring,” Frank said earnestly. “Just asking. That’s how you get to know people. You ask.”

Betty nodded. “He’s right. You do have to ask.”

Grace pressed her lips together and stared at the counter.

“Uh, how long have you uh, lived in this town for?” I managed to stumble out.

“Well, my home life, frankly. Yep, grew up here. It was even smaller back in the day, but now, because of all that industrialisation, people moving to the cities and all, we’ve added buildings slowly and slowly, and now we’re a proper functioning town. But I decided staying was the best for me because I love Hollowbend and I just never found a great reason to leave and, well, I suppose if you never find a reason to go then you just… don’t.”

I’m not sure if I even saw Betty breathe once throughout that whole verbal dump.

Grace forced a polite smile. “That’s… nice.”

Betty leaned closer, lowering her voice as though she were sharing a secret. “And the thing is, everyone who comes here ends up staying. People say it’s the pies, but I think it’s the way the streets feel under your shoes. You know? Comfortable.” She nodded to herself, satisfied.

Frank clapped his hands together suddenly, startling both of us. “Well, now that’s settled. What are your thoughts on root vegetables?”

My mouth opened and closed a few times. Grace blinked.

“They’re… fine?” I offered.

Frank beamed. “Good man. A town can’t run without a good beet crop. Everyone says so.”

Betty chimed in, smiling wide. “Yes, everyone says so.”

Grace and I looked at each other for a few seconds, utter bewilderment and confusion upon our faces.

“Well, I guess we’d best be on our way. Is there uh, a place to stay? Like a motel or something.”

Before realising the mistake I had just made, Betty was already spouting off about the town history and how there used not to be a hotel, but now there is, and who owns it. In that verbal diarrhea, we did manage to hear the name.

“…Friendly Pines Motel,” I repeated slowly, as if saying it aloud would help it make sense.

“Yes! That’s the one,” Betty said, nodding like she’d just handed us the map to paradise. “Very nice. Can’t miss it. Just down Main Street, past the church, turn left at the bank, you’ll see the sign, bright green, says ‘Friendly Pines’ in big, cheerful letters. Don’t worry, dear, you’ll be fine.”

“Great, thanks, Betty.” Grace said, trying to push me out the door.

“Grace, we didn’t pay,” I reminded her, tugging gently on her sleeve.

Betty waved a hand dismissively, a wide, confident smile on her face. “Oh, don’t you worry about that, dear. Coffees on the house. Happens all the time for visitors; some of them never even bring coins. Not that you’d notice.” She gave a little laugh, but it was the kind of laugh that made it feel like she genuinely didn’t see the need for any explanation.

Quickly leaving before we could be roped back into another conversation, we started to walk down the road towards the motel.

“How are we even going to pay for this?” Grace wondered, “I mean, it’s not like we carry cash, and I doubt our credit cards would even work.”

“I was just thinking the same thing. I guess we could always try with our cards and hope for the best.” I offered up.

We walked in silence for a few steps; the town’s neat little streets were lined with brick and timber buildings that seemed almost self-conscious about the space they occupied. Each storefront was meticulously kept, with paint that shone just enough to suggest pride without drawing too much attention. The lampposts were perfectly spaced, the sidewalks swept clean, and yet the precision made everything feel a little unnatural.

Grace’s gaze drifted to the waterfront on our right, the sunlight glinting off the water in a way that made the small bay look almost like a hidden gem, tucked just out of sight. “I didn’t even know this was here,” she murmured, her voice quiet, almost hesitant. “My parents never mentioned it.”

I squinted against the glare, the waves catching the light in fleeting patterns. “Yeah… It’s like the town hides itself until it wants to be seen,” I said, feeling a shiver contrasting with the afternoon sun.

She frowned, tilting her head, as if trying to make sense of the shapes and lines of the streets. “Almost as if it’s trying to condense itself as much as possible, but parts keep spilling out”.

We walked in silence the rest of the way to the motel, passing countless people that seemed too many for the size of the town. The sidewalks were crowded with small conversations: a man leaning too close to a woman as he told a story with exaggerated hand movements; a pair of teenagers laughing a fraction too loud at something unfunny; an old lady sweeping her porch in slow, deliberate strokes, nodding at every passerby as if acknowledging them for an invisible roll call.

The Friendly Pines Motel loomed ahead, its sign in cheery green letters glowing faintly even in the daylight. The exterior was modest, almost shy, but when we stepped through the glass doors, the lobby stretched out before us like it belonged to a completely different building.

Two curved grand staircases swept out from either side of the front desk, their red-carpeted steps climbing upward in perfect symmetry before vanishing around opposite corners. Polished wooden banisters gleamed under the warm light of chandeliers, which swung just slightly, though there was no breeze.

The air smelled faintly of pine and lemon polish. A grandfather clock ticked steadily in the corner, its pendulum swinging a half-beat slower than seemed natural.

Grace stopped short. “This is… not what I expected.”

“WELCOME!” a booming voice rang out from the top of the grand staircase, startling both of us.

We looked up to see a man standing there, striking a pose as though the entire lobby were his stage. He was dressed head to toe in elaborate attire: a deep burgundy tailcoat with gold trim, a towering black top hat perched at a jaunty angle, and a long black cane tipped with a silver wolf’s head. His handlebar moustache was so extravagantly curled it seemed to defy gravity.

Beside him stood a woman, equally theatrical in style, her sequined dress glittering under the chandelier light as if she’d stepped straight out of a 1920s burlesque reel. A feathered headpiece curved upward from her hair, but her face was locked into a scowl of annoyance and hate targeted towards us.

We watched in stunned silence as the man hooked his cane on the railing and, with surprising grace, slid down the banister in a single sweeping motion. The woman followed at his side, descending the staircase with a slinky, deliberate sway.

They landed before us with a flourish.

“Ah, newcomers!” the man announced, sweeping his hat from his head and bowing low, his moustache twitching with the motion. “Welcome, welcome to our fine establishment! I am…” He paused dramatically; cane raised to the ceiling as though summoning lightning. “…Mr. Alastair DuPont, owner and humble servant to all who seek rest beneath the Friendly Pines!”

He struck a pose. For a moment, the air seemed to thrum, and we thought we heard what sounded like a smattering of applause and cheers, but from nowhere in particular.

“And this young thing,” he continued, swooping an arm toward his companion, “is my beautiful wife, Everlyn.”

He bent down with exaggerated gallantry, kissing her hand before springing back upright with theatrical speed. Everlyn, maintaining her poise, slowly reached into her clutch and produced a baby wipe. She wiped hard at the exact spot where his lips had touched, expression unchanged, then discarded the wipe neatly into a handbag without breaking eye contact with us.

“Pleasure.” She said with a tone that just oozed venom and contempt, though Mr DuPont didn’t seem to mind. Grace and I exchanged glances. The whole performance felt rehearsed, like we'd walked into the middle of a play that had been running for decades.  "We, uh, we'd like a room," I managed, my voice cracking slightly.  "Of course, of course!" Mr DuPont exclaimed, spinning his cane like a baton before catching it with a flourish. “We shall prepare for you our finest room. Come,” and he immediately started speed walking in the opposite direction, back up the stairs. We tried to follow behind him, but we struggled to keep up with him through all the twists and turns of the motel. Mr DuPont moved with impossible speed, his coat tails billowing behind him as he navigated the maze-like interior with the confidence of someone who'd walked these paths for decades. “Keep up, keep up!" he called over his shoulder, his voice echoing off the walls.

Finally, Mr DuPont stopped in front of a door marked with a brass plaque that simply read "The Suite." He produced an elaborate skeleton key from his waistcoat and turned it with a ceremonial flourish. “Your palace awaits!" he announced, throwing the door open with a dramatic sweep of his arm.

 “Palace” was a massive overstatement. The room had a double bed that had a noticeable sag in the middle, along with a single nightstand that looked straight out of the 50s. There was a small armchair wedged awkwardly in the narrow gap between the bed and the wall. The wallpaper was a faded floral pattern, peeling at the corners where moisture had crept in over the years. A thin brown carpet covered the floor, worn through to the backing in a path from the door to the bed. Heavy curtains covered the single window.

“This is….” I started to say before being interrupted by, “I know, it’s a lot to take in.” Mr DuPont said, beaming with pride. “The best part is, it’s only $100 a night!” Grace gave me a quick look before asking, “Is there a possibility we could get two single beds in here?”

DuPont looked at us very blankly and said, “No,” before quickly getting back in character. “Well, I’ll leave you to two settle in, I’ll just take your card, and I’ll charge you after your stay comes to an end.”

That worked out conveniently for us.

 

Grace sat heavily on the sagging bed, which creaked ominously under her weight. "Marc, this is so fucked."

"I know." I slumped into the armchair, which was even more uncomfortable than it looked. The springs had given up years ago. "How do we get back?"

Grace was quiet for a long time, staring out the window at the timeless street scene below. "What if we can't get back? What if this is just... our life now?"

“I doubt it’s that dire, Grace. I’m sure everything will be fine.” I was bluffing. I just wanted to say something that would make us both feel better.

"Since we're in ‘92, wanna try finding your parents?" I suggested, mostly to fill the silence.

Grace shifted uncomfortably. "I don't know. They always got weird when I brought up Hollowbend. Never wanted to talk about it." She paused. "But I guess it would be interesting to see what they were like back then."

She yawned and looked at the single bed. "So... how are we handling sleeping arrangements?"

I glanced at the uncomfortable armchair. "I'll take the chair. I've slept in worse places."

"Don't be ridiculous. We're both adults. We can share a bed without making it weird."

"If you're sure..."

"I'm sure. Besides," she said, settling onto one side of the bed, "if we're stuck in 1992 forever, we might as well get comfortable."

I took the other side, both of us staying fully clothed and keeping to our respective edges of the sagging mattress.
