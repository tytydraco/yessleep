I am dictating this from the bathroom floor. The tile is cold under my palms. The house is quiet except for the hum of the air conditioner and my son’s sleep-muffled cough down the hall.

They say a father is the shepherd of his home. I believed that, even after I drifted from the Church. I told myself ritual wasn’t necessary to stay close to truth. My wife trusted me, my kids trusted me… and I thought that was enough.

It began with the mirror.

At first, my reflection lagged a fraction of a second. Then one night, I watched it blink when my eyes were open. A deliberate, slow blink. Later, it smiled when I wasn’t smiling.

I kept it secret. If it was madness, speaking it would make it real. If it was spiritual, acknowledging it would invite it deeper. So I watched in silence.

Then the whispering began. At first, static. Then words. Then my own voice calling my name in the same firm tone I use when my kids are about to step into danger.

Soon the shadows moved outside the mirror. Black shapes slithered along the walls. My wife saw nothing. My kids laughed. But I was terrified.

One night, the whisper grew clear: “You walked away. You left the shield down. Now I am in your house.”

Later, my son stood by my bed, pale and trembling.
“Daddy, the man in the dark says you can’t protect us anymore.”

“What man?” I whispered.

“The one who stands behind you in the mirror. He says you let him in.”

“He’s wrong,” I told him in an attempt to convince us both.

The next day I went to a priest. He gave me holy water, a St. Benedict medal, and told me to bless the mirrors, claim my home, pray aloud. To not trust the thing on the other side.

That night I pressed wet fingers to the bathroom mirror. Frost raced across the glass. My reflection’s mouth opened wider than a mouth should, releasing a guttural growl. A freezing wind poured from the glass, carrying the stench of decay.

“You think water can save you?” it rumbled. “You abandoned the light. The shadows claim you now.”

The mirror rippled like water. Behind me, I saw my children’s reflections in the doorway. Blank faces. Moving lips.

“Daddy. Let him in. He’ll protect us now.”

I pushed harder with the sign of the cross. The image cracked. Not the glass, but the reflection itself. Silence fell.

But when I looked again, my reflection smiled. Small. Private. It lifted its hand. I didn’t.

That night I woke to the mattress dipping, as if someone had sat at the foot of the bed. The smell of sulfur thickened the air. A voice in my head, calm and cold:

“You set down the staff. I picked it up. The flock is safer with me.”

The next morning, letters rose across my chest in mirror-writing welts: MINE.

Now, every mirror is covered, but towels never stay in place. 

At 3:12 the glass breathes. My reflection crouches like an animal, blinking three times. It’s our family’s private sign for I love you.

I hear my daughter’s door hinge creak though I’m still on the floor. I smell hot pennies.

My reflection is standing. I am not.

If you pray, pray now. If you don’t, do whatever you do when someone is about to fall from a cliff.

Because I’m about to stand. And I don’t know if it’ll be me who rises.
