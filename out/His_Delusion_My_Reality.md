September 2, 2023, was the day my family and I took a trip to West Virginia to spend the weekend at a quaint little cabin tucked miles away from any form of civilization. There is a sense of peace that comes with the idea of being completely disconnected from the world. This disconnect was amplified upon arrival, as we found we had lost connection on our phones at least two miles before reaching the cabin. Once we arrived, I helped my family unload the car, bringing in bags of food and clothes to ensure a wonderful weekend with loved ones.

Children ran around and spent time with my grandparents and family on the first night, playing cards, reflecting on memories, and sharing laughs. As time passed and it grew late, everyone prepared to sleep after a long day of traveling and activities at the cabin. I stood at the kitchen sink, washing the dishes from our earlier dinner while my grandfather gazed out the window into the dark void of the night. There’s something unsettling about how dark it is outside when you are so far from any town, city, or even a small gas station.

 I want to clarify that my grandfather suffers from severe dementia; this detail will be important shortly. I called out to him, asking what he was doing, considering it was just the two of us in the living room at that point, with all the children and other family members fast asleep in their respective rooms.  There was a moment of silence, punctuated only by the water from the sink faucet dripping onto the freshly washed plates and silverware. With his gaze fixed on the darkness engulfing the night, he said, “The men standing by the tree line, I wonder what they are doing out there?” As I mentioned earlier, this is not the first time I’ve heard a bizarre statement from my grandfather, given the severity of his dementia at this point. Still, the human mind is capable of wandering to worst-case scenarios.

Dread momentarily washed over me at the thought of men waiting in the woods, watching us through the windows. I may not have mentioned it until now, but the cabin’s main recreational area has no curtains on the large windows that wrap around the room. The best way I can describe it is to have you imagine a large sunroom, or in this case, envision it feeling like a fishbowl—completely exposed to the things concealed by the darkness and only occasionally illuminated by the faint silhouettes of the stars in the sky. The scariest part about windows like this is that when the lights are on in the dead of night, all we see are reflections inside the home, while whatever this potential threat could be outside has a clear view of what is going on inside the cabin.

That said, I am a logical thinker and quickly shake off the idea of how crazy it would be for anyone to be that far out in the woods. What rational person would be several miles from civilization watching a family?  As quickly as the idea came, it went, and I laughed off my grandfather's statement suggesting that it was getting late and we should get to sleep. With my grandfather off to his room and asleep, I decided to err on the side of safety and ensure that all the windows in the cabin and the doors were completely locked. Something about what my grandfather had said lingered in the back of my mind, enough for me to be extra cautious that night. Being too cautious never hurt anything, right?

 

The next morning, I woke up to the sun creeping over the trees, serving as nature's alarm clock. Not wanting to burn my retinas, I stumbled out of bed and made my way to the main area where the rest of the family was. I walked over to my father, who was cooking eggs on the skillet; the smell of fresh eggs and bacon was always one of my favorite things growing up. I muttered to him about the events of the night prior, trying to keep my voice down so I wouldn’t scare my nephews, who were sitting on the couch, entranced by their kids' shows and playing with their toys. My father interrupted my story, which I was telling in a joking manner, thinking he might find it funny, with a rather abrupt and stern response. “Did you leave the sliding door unlocked last night? It was cracked open slightly this morning.” I called his bluff almost immediately.

My father and I have a tendency to give each other a hard time and like to mess with each other. I quickly realized, with the stern stare he was giving me, that he wasn’t joking. I told him that I had checked everything; the only thing I could think was that I must have missed it. There is no other rational explanation. Regardless, this does not change the fact that the lurking fear of what my grandfather thought he saw was actually there. Did I brush off a genuine concern? Were there actually men standing in the tree line? What did they want? I had to correct my train of thought to prevent my imagination from running in a hundred different directions and return to the most practical reality: it was just another delusional statement from my grandfather, who was not in his right mind.

 As the day passed and the sun began to disappear behind the trees, we were prepping dinner and setting the table— a wholesome moment of my entire family working in unison, with the house full of laughter and joy.  The events that followed, however, resembled a completely different reality. I set the last plate down on the table, my mother calling out to everyone in the room, “Dinner's ready.” At that exact moment, the power in the cabin went out, and the darkness I mentioned earlier wasn’t just outside anymore. It quickly enveloped the entire cabin with the same darkness that surrounded us outside. Initially, we all brushed it off as a temporary power outage. Nothing to worry about; surely, it was a common occurrence being this far out in nature. Everyone with a phone turned on their light to try to illuminate the dark cabin, and that’s when I believe I experienced true fear.

My 4-year-old nephew let out a blood-curdling scream, falling to the floor by the window, crying. We all tried to comfort him, telling him that this kind of thing was normal and there was nothing to fear in the dark. Once his father finally calmed him from his hysterical crying, his father asked, “What has you so scared, bud?” His response was the last thing anyone would expect to hear from the mouth of an innocent child. He struggled to get the words out through his sobbing, saying, “The men standing in the trees are scaring me!”

 At that very moment, I realized how foolish I had been for disregarding my grandfather’s words, brushing off the cracked open, unlocked door. He hadn’t heard the conversation from the night before, yet what he said reinforced my grandfather’s statement from that same night. I frantically, but quietly, trying not to escalate my nephew’s fear, told my brother-in-law about the night before and what had happened. Before I could finish my sentence, my father said, “Everyone pack your things; we are leaving right now!” I stood at the front door, staring into the darkness while everyone hurried to pack their things. The fear continued to grow; I felt as though I had a thousand needles in my skin. I made the mistake of staring into the dark; it only makes things worse to know you cannot see what can see you.

 

You know that feeling you get when you are being watched? Amplify that feeling with it being a reality. All the bags were rushed to the vehicles, all the while I watched the dark corners of the night, waiting for something or someone to dart out of the shadows at us. We quickly left after loading the vehicles, leaving behind multiple items that were not important at the time, considering the situation we found ourselves in. As we pulled away, I was in the far back seat with my nephew in the middle row, still crying. I stared into the dark abyss of the tree line and could have sworn I saw them.

 Did I finally witness this haunting group of men, or was it just my mind running rampant? Do you want to know what is scarier than experiencing the most horrific sight imaginable? Your mind creating it for you. The mind can conjure nightmares far worse than anything real when in a state of panic and fear of something unseen. My father informed the cabin manager about what happened, and they gave us a full refund, no questions asked. To say the least, that will be the last time I ever visit that quaint little cabin tucked away in the woods.
