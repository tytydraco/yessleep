Hi guys!! Sorry it’s been so long since my last blog, things have been.. weird!   
  
So, as I wrote in my last blog, Mike and I got Maggie those dog talking buttons so she can communicate with us.  
Like, what a cool idea right?!  
  
I’ve always thought it would be so amazing to know what was going on in my sweet doggies mind, like my dream would be to have a conversation with her (I know, HAHA – maybe I can be classed as a crazy dog lady lol – but seriously who wouldn’t want to have a convo with their fur babies!)  
  
Anywho, I ordered them on Amazon and they arrived the next day, we got started on training straight away.  
  
I have to say, Mike was pretty sceptical at first. He thought it was a load of crap, not that he actually said that, but I could just tell he didn’t think it was going to work.  
  
As we have discussed previously on my blog, I use the same method of training for everything, a lot of repetition, treats, patience.  
But I thought Maggie would pick it up pretty fast – she’s such a smart dog! – and I was right, not even 4 days later and Maggie was using the buttons to let us know when she wanted to go outside, if she wanted a pat, or that she would like to go out for a walk! It was amazing!  
  
You can programme the buttons to say basically whatever you like, which is pretty wicked! Mike thought it would be funny to programme a button each to say mum and dad, and see which one of us she called for the most. He’s so funny like that.  
  
Everything was going great, I felt closer to Maggie than ever, being able to understand her and she seemed to be thriving, loving the extra attention and treats.  
  
I’ll wake up of a morning to make my coffee and Maggie would walk over to her buttons, press down on three of them, say love – you – mum. And it felt like my heart would burst with happiness.  
  
I filmed our training and experience and have been getting the footage edited so I can share it on here for you guys, as I always do. I just love educating other dog mums and dads.  
  
Mike went fishing over the weekend, so I thought it would be the perfect time to work on my video and upload it, but just now   
I sat down to watch the last bit of the footage and.. and I feel really scared.   
  
I’d left the camcorder on while, recording in the lounge while Maggie played with her soft teddy and I went to grab a few things from the supermarket.  
  
The video was nondescript at first, Maggie just rolling around on the carpet, toy in mouth. I almost skipped over, but I had a strange gut feeling I needed to keep watching.  
  
A few moments passed and then I saw Maggie suddenly jump up, and drop her teddy, her tail in a slow and steady wag.   
She seemed to focus on the window, which with how the camcorder was angled, I didn’t have a great view out of.  
Maybe she’d seen a neighbours kid or something.  
  
She ran over to the buttons and pressed the same one over and over, in excited session.  
“Dad – dad – dad – dad”  
  
I was confused.   
  
Mike was definitely not due home until the next evening, but maybe for some reason he’d come back early.  
  
Maggie was going crazy, jumping around in excitement at the window, trying to reach her dad from behind the glass.  
  
She seemed excited to begin with, but her jumping and whining soon turned frantic, her moan high pitched.   
  
I started getting an even stranger feeling in my stomach, the way Maggie was acting was odd, making me uneasy.   
She even barked a few times, which is something she NEVER does.   
  
I was starting to worry that she’d distrubed a would be intruder or something of the like, but then Mike’s face came into view in the frame.  
  
Maggie was absolutely growling now, as Mike got closer and closer, his face seemingly filling up the whole window now.   
  
He wasn’t smiling, his face set in a weird grimace, his eyes .. it was too far, the video footage too grainy, to tell exactly what was not right with his eyes, but it was obvious something was wrong.  
  
I watched, waiting for Mike to wave at our dog or even come inside the front door, but he just remained at the window, unmoving, unsmiling while Maggie growled and howled at his image.  
  
My blood went cold when slowly, but surely, Mikes head began to rise,as if he had somehow been kneeling at our window, and was now standing up at full height.  
But.. his neck didn’t come into view, nor his shoulders. It was his head, yes. His head on a long, wooden rod.  
  
The head bobbled back and forth like it may fall off the stick, making it a macabre scene where it looked as if Mike was shaking his head.  
  
I let out a scream.  
  
In the video, Mike’s head sways back and forth for a few more moments, as if waving hello, before disappearing out of view.  
  
There is nothing else on the video until it records me getting home from the supermarket, grocery bags in hand.  
  
I’m writing this because I hope someone can help me. Please.  
I’m stuck at the computer.  
I left my handbag, with my phone, on the bench in the kitchen. I was about to run out to grab it, call the police but Maggie ... she’s just started pressing buttons again, repeating – Dad – dad – dad – dad – over and over.  
  
I don’t think we are alone in the house.  
  
Please send police to (redacted address) – Maggie and I would love you forever!  
  
Thanks for reading this week’s blog, hopefully next week I’ll have a better update!
