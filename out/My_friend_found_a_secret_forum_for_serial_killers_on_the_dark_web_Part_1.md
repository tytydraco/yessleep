I first met my roommate Randall last fall, when I was moving into student housing at Northampton Community College. He’d been living there a few weeks already when I arrived, and had already taken over half the common area with his things – a soda-stained futon, two bean bag chairs, and an Ikea computer desk with a crooked *Johnny Mnemonic* poster taped above it. 

When the RA first introduced us, Randall shook my hand a little too hard, but then he also apologized. This would become a pattern with him. Take things too far; apologize. 

He and I had a lot in common. We were both in the computer science program, both hopelessly into early ‘90s hip hop, and both had a lingering Magic the Gathering habit left over from high school. We became fast friends. 

But we differed in one significant way: Randall loved to push peoples’ buttons. When first getting to know someone, he took special delight in seeing if he could offend them, as if he were testing their limits (or testing mine). But he never meant anything by it. That was just Randall being Randall.

It didn’t take long for his penchant for button-pushing to develop into a little game between us, called “Oops Wrong Link.” I forget who came up with the name. 

The way you play is, first you text your opponent something like “Did you get the syllabus yet? Here’s the link:” or “Dorney Park is doing a free day on Friday, check it out:”  before firing off a link to something creepy or bizarre you found on the internet. The goal each time was to outdo the last link you received, and the first person to chicken out was the loser (or the winner, depending on how you looked at it).

We started with videos like Rubber Johnny or I Feel Fantastic, but Randall quickly moved on to grosser or more disturbing content like Tubgirl or One Man One Jar. I could give as much as I got, so I humored him for a while, but I had to eventually tell him in no uncertain terms that the Budd Dwyer tape was not something I needed to see while I was eating cherry cobbler in the dining hall. He agreed, and even offered me an apology. Our texting went quiet, and I assumed the game was over.

Then one morning while I was in class, Randall texted me a link I didn’t recognize. What I mean is, I didn’t recognize it was a link at all. It looked like a randomized jumble of letters followed by .onion instead of .com. I tried clicking on it but the link wouldn’t load.

“?” I responded.

“I win.”

“What is it?” 

“Tell you later,” he replied, then added “But I win.”

When I got back from class, Randall sat me down and swiveled his monitor to face me. On screen was a Tor browser, the kind you use to connect to the dark web. He asked if I’d heard of it. 

“Like the Silk Road, right?” I asked.

“I mean yeah, but they shut that down. Still can’t believe Ross was dumb enough to get caught.” 

“Ross?” 

“You know, Ross Ulbricht. Gotta be careful how you connect.”

“So what am I looking at exactly?”

What I was looking at was a shoddily designed forum homepage that was exclusively written in Comic Sans. I knew enough to know that forums on the dark web could have one of exactly three purposes: to organize resistance in authoritarian states, to pontificate about how important internet privacy is, or to do evil things.

“This isn’t, like… Don’t tell me this is a site for ped–”

“Jesus! No, hell no! Nothing like that. I’m not some sicko. Here.”

He scrolled up to the forum title, written in tiny, spaced-out letters: 

^(p                  i                  g                                h                  e                  a                  v                  e                  n)

Randall eyeballed me, stifling a laugh.

“Is it a forum about barbecue?” I asked. As it turned out, it was not. 

“Go ahead, check it out.” 

“I don’t know if I want to.”

“You want to.”

Randall slid his mousepad over to me, so I began to scroll around the site as he gauged my reaction, still testing my boundaries.

I moused past the forum categories, the names becoming progressively more concerning:

* General
* Press
* Public Broadcasting 
* Pit Builds
* Rigging
* Pig Selection
* Improvised Anatomy
* Culinary
* Random

“Pick one,” said Randall with a grin. I let go of the mouse.

“I don’t think I want to pick one.”

“Which would you pick if you had to.”

“But I don’t have to.”

“Pretend you do.”

I took a deep breath. “Okay. I don’t know. How about General?”

Randall let out a disappointed sigh and clicked on General.

Over the next hour I learned that, supposedly, Pig Heaven was a forum on the dark web for serial killers. Not *about* serial killers mind you, but *for* serial killers.

Randall had found, through sheer force of will, a secret forum where the members either pretended *very hard* that they were serial killers, or were actual, bonafide, flesh and blood (and guts) serial killers.

Thankfully most of the categories were only available to official members, and Randall was not one of them. But General, Press, and Random were visible to anyone with a Tor browser, and their contents were enough to make me regret every decision that had led up to this moment in my life. 

On second thought, I guess Random was okay. 

But the other two were bad. 

One of the most troubling things was the slang they used. Instead of talking about victims, murder weapons, or blood, they would use euphemisms. “Pigs” were victims, “pits” were homemade dungeons, “toys” were murder weapons, “sauce” was blood, and “getting tired” meant dying. Members preferred to speak in the third person, using the term God to refer to themselves. A handful of them had partners in crime who they universally referred to as their “wife,” regardless of gender or whether they were married. 

This led to phrases that were somehow made even worse by the euphemisms, like “God wanted to keep playing but his pig ran out of sauce and got tired,” or “God’s wife found an oink oink wandering down I-80 East and remanded it to the pit for playtime.”

If you’re wondering, yes, there was a leaderboard.

“This can’t be real,” I said. The words had escaped my mouth a few times as we clicked around the site, but only now did Randall pipe up.

“I think it might be.”

“No way. It says there are 1,622 active members.”

“So?”

“So there can’t be that many serial killers. That’s impossible.”

“Why is that impossible? It’s a global site.”

“Because, I mean…” I trailed off. “Isn’t that too many? That would mean…” I opened the calculator app on my phone and did some napkin math. “Okay, let’s say the state population is 13 million, so if 5% of all serial killers are on this site, that would make…” I typed it in. “52 active serial killers in PA alone.”

“Yeah. And?”

“And there aren’t.”

“How do you know?”

I thought for a moment.

“Because… there just aren’t. There can’t be. There’d be something in the news.”

Randall grabbed the mouse, clicked in the search bar, typed “pennsylvania,” and hit enter. The forum showed 259 results. He looked at me.

All I could say was, “No. I’m done talking about this, and I’m going to sleep. Please for the love of God, close this thing.” 

As I got up and wandered back to my room, I heard Randall call out after me: “It’s just the internet.” Internet or not, I shut the door behind me and tried to get some rest.

That night I laid in bed thinking about what we had seen. I kept trying to reassure myself that it was just edgelords LARPing on the internet, but even if the posts were fake, the fact that so many people could enjoy writing about that stuff was unsettling. Something had been dislodged in my brain, and I couldn’t get it back into place no matter how hard I tried.

The next morning in class I got a Telegram invite from Randall. “Cool if we talk about the site stuff here? App is encrypted. Just being on the safe side.”

“NO,” I responded in all caps.

“No you don’t mind lol?”

“No we’re not talking about the site stuff.”

“You sure?”

“YES” I responded, then put my phone away.

I had hoped that attending Community College might put me back in touch with, you know, a community. A place where I felt like I belonged. I had Randall, sure, but I was beginning to worry that being friends with Randall meant being friends with nobody else. As the semester dragged on, being surrounded by so many insular groups of longtime companions with their in-jokes and shared histories had only made me feel more and more like an outsider.

Over the next few days, Randall and I settled into a kind of unspoken truce. We would talk about music, classes, which Magic the Gathering set was the worst… anything but the site. But inside, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. 

My mind kept going back to a forum category called “Press,” which mostly contained links to media articles about deaths. Half the links were to stories that were reported as if they were tragic accidents, not murders. Members had claimed responsibility for these, and described in detail how they had killed their “pigs” and then staged the bodies. Could there really be so many?

One day Randall stopped speaking to me. 

He had been closing himself away in his room more and more often, but this time was different. This time it was radio silence. When I’d see him in the mornings or catch him coming back from class, he would try to avoid eye contact or pretend not to hear me when I said hello.

So I knocked on his bedroom door, but there was no answer. I knew he was in there, so I knocked again, louder this time.

“Can we talk?” I said.

“About what,” came the answer through the door.

“About what’s going on with you.”

After a while, Randall opened the door and let me in. His eyes were bloodshot. He looked like one of those POW’s who have a thousand yard stare after years of torture.

“What’s going on, man. Just tell me.”

His eyes danced to the bedroom window. An old maple tree outside was moving gently in the wind. He watched it for a moment until the wind died down. “So you know that forum?”

I knew that forum. “What about it?”

“I got a membership.”

“What does that mean?”

“If you want full access to the site, you need a membership. But first you have to apply, right? They give you three days to, you know… *kill* someone. To prove you’re legit. It’s like a probationary period or whatever. You’re supposed to say who you’re going to kill, how you plan to do it, what calling card you’ll leave at the scene, and then post a link to the news coverage when it’s done.”

“Randall… You’re not actually… Don’t tell me you’re planning to hurt somebody.”

“What? No. No dude. Of course not. I just wanted access.”

That was a relief. I sat down on the edge of his bed. “Then what’s wrong?”

“What’s wrong is when you’re on probation you can see the rest of the site. And there’s other stuff on it. Pictures and stuff.”

“I bet it’s just old forensics photos. You need to stop looking at that crap. It’ll mess up your brain.”

“That’s not the point. The point is they broadcast it. Publicly. It’s on *YouTube*.”

“What do you mean it’s on YouTube.”

“They’re live-streaming stuff.”

“Like, *YouTube* YouTube? That’s not possible. There’s content moderation.”

“The videos look totally normal. If you watch them in a browser they look like local sports broadcasts or public domain movies or whatever. But they have secret encrypted content hidden in the data. If you know the password, and the right decryption algorithm, you can watch it. There’s no way for anyone to tell that it’s there unless they know how to decrypt it.”

“I don’t understand. What are you saying?”

His voice became a whisper. “They’re live-streaming murders on YouTube.”

The air caught in my lungs.

“It’s a real forum. It’s *real*. I don’t know what to do.”

I knew exactly what to do. “We have to go to the cops.”

“You don’t understand.”

“Yes I do, Randall.”

“Yeah, but dude… Our address…” His voice trailed off.

I was silent for a moment. “Our address what?”

Randall put his head in his hands.

“Sixteen-hundred serial killers have our address.”

I forgot how to breathe. I forgot how to think. Randall did me a favor by filling the silence. 

“When you apply for membership, you have to give them your name and address. I guess it’s like a collateral thing. When I applied I was sure it was fake or whatever. I was sure they were all just pretending. Like you said, there couldn’t be that many sick bastards out there.”

“But there are.”

Randall slowly nodded. “There are.”
