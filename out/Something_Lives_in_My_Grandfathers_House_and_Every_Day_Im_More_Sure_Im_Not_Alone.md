I’m a teenage girl living with my family in a small apartment inside my grandfather’s house. And lately, I’ve started to feel like something isn’t right.

One night, I was sitting alone in the living room watching a show on my phone. I needed to use the bathroom, so I got up and left the light on. When I came back, I kept watching the episode—until it suddenly froze. Bored, I started looking around the apartment. My eyes landed on the bathroom door… and the light was off.

I’m 100% sure I didn’t turn it off. No one else had passed by me. I didn’t hear a sound. I stared into the dark space beyond the door and thought to myself:

If you’re a ghost, please… not now. I’m alone.

I tried to laugh it off, convincing myself maybe I just forgot. But deep down, I was scared.

And that was just the beginning.

A few nights later, I went to bed early. I had school the next day. I fell asleep quickly. But in the middle of the night, I woke up suddenly. No noise. Just a weight—like someone was sitting on my waist.

I was lying on my side. Slowly, I turned my head… and what I saw, I’ll never forget.

There was a girl.

Her hair was long, black, tangled, and covered in dust. She wore a white dress torn and stained with black marks, like she had been abandoned somewhere for years. Her face was… blurred. I couldn’t make out her features. My heart froze. But strangely, I fell asleep again. Just like that. As if something made me.

After that night, the dreams started.

Not normal dreams—realistic nightmares. It felt like I was entering another world. Every dream was short, but terrifying. Once, I saw a leg burning. Another time, I was walking through a ruined house full of distant screams. I’d wake up gasping for air.

I tried to convince myself it was all in my head. Maybe it was just from the novels I read, or stress.

But then, my cousin told me something chilling.

She overheard my mom telling my aunt about something that happened. My mom had overslept and was alone in the house—everyone else had gone to work. Suddenly, she heard loud banging on the front door, and a man yelling:

"Whoever’s inside… come out!"

My mom didn’t think twice. She got dressed quickly and ran out of the house.

And me? I still see things. Shadows moving in the corner of my eye. Doors creaking open. Light touches on my shoulder when there’s no one behind me. It’s become so common that I’ve stopped reacting. Almost like I’m getting used to it.

The strange part? I’ve started feeling… curious.

Like I want to know what this is. I’ve even thought about playing with a Ouija board. But no one will join me. Every time I bring it up, people go quiet—like they know something I don’t. Like there’s a secret they’re keeping from me.

So I’m writing this here. To share my story. To ask:

Is this real?

Or am I slowly losing my mind?
