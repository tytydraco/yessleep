When Taylor asked me out to dinner, I knew what was going to happen. Same thing that always happened when I went on a date. I really liked her, though. I thought maybe that could make a difference. 

Maybe, if I tried hard enough, I could just ignore it - just ignore *her*. 

I was wrong. 

\-------

Seated across from my date in the candlelit restaurant, I felt my phantom itch begin to flare up, setting the small of my back on fire. Taylor had been recounting her time in the police academy, but I couldn't follow what she was saying. The discomfort broke my concentration. As the itch's burning pleads intensified, my eyes darted around the dining room, horrified by what was appearing around me.

As expected, I had begun seeing the face everywhere.

It was in the pattern of our server’s tie, as well as on the red tablecloth beside me, formed from a very particular set of creases. It was on Taylor’s plate, as the arrangement of her half-eaten veal parmesan had created the image of a single bulging eye above a hooked nose.

Forcefully, I scratched the small of my back while keeping my eyes locked on Taylor, trying to keep this date afloat. Judging by her newly furrowed brow, I appeared to be doing a terrible job at hiding my distress, however. My clipped fingernails dragged against the burning patch of skin through my undershirt, but it was no use. No matter what I did, the sensation refused to yield.

The itch always gets worse when the face is around, and the face always comes around when I’m on a date.

Frustrated, I gave up on relieving the itch and brought my hand back to the table, accidentally knocking over my glass of Pinot Noir with the side of my wrist. It splashed onto my white napkin, staining it with the start of a familiar pattern. Taylor sprung to action, grabbing her napkin to help clean up the mess, but I intercepted her hand.

*“Wait…wait a second,”* I mumbled, eyes glued to the developing spill.

As the liquid lost momentum, I saw it; a crisply detailed face, framed by the white material like an impromptu watercolor painting or a purple-red Rorschach Test.

It was the same face that had haunted me since I was nineteen. The same snaggle-toothed smirk with the same bulging right eye, accompanied by the same sharply hooked nose connecting those two features.

*There she is,* I thought to myself.

Nervous sweat dripped down my face like condensation falling off a cold glass of lemonade on a sweltering day. I felt my lips quiver as I spoke, forming shaky words.

*“Taylor…I understand how this sounds, but…do you see anything on the napkin? Like…anything recognizable?”* I asked without looking up, gaze still fixed on the horrible stain.

*“Uhm…well, turn it towards me.”*

When I finally looked at her, she was squinting at the napkin, studying the crimson design. For a moment, I was gripped by a profound twinge of embarrassment, anxious thoughts popping into my head like rapidly growing weeds.

*Taylor’s a gorgeous, intelligent, remarkably kind woman. And I’m completely blowing my chance to make us into something. Don’t scare her off.*

A subtle change in her expression pulled me out of my self-loathing; a small tilt of her head complemented by a flicker of her eyes. It might have been recognition. She might have truly seen the face.

But I didn’t remain at that table long enough to ask.

As I blinked, Taylor’s face instantly disappeared, seamlessly replaced by the horrific visage I was asking if she could see in the stain. My body trembled with that one protruding eye glaring at me, bloodshot capillaries writhing like thin snakes under the white membrane. Before I could even think, a familiar phrase slipped out of the corner of her mouth, snaggletooth wiggling as those two familiar words became airborne.

*“You’re mine.”*

I let loose a scream, falling from my chair and onto the ground. Taylor jumped out from the table, rushing over to me with a look of concern painted on her *actual* face, but I was inconsolable. Wild with fear, I turned from her and started to run, briefly traversing the carpet on all fours like a rabid animal. By the time I was sprinting out of the restaurant, I had gotten to my feet, panting ragged breaths as I slid into the front seat of my car and sped off.

\-------

That was three months ago. She ended up paying for both of our meals. Not only that, but she had to Uber home since I had driven her there.

Needless to say, Taylor didn’t reach out to arrange a second date. 

There was one tiny silver lining, thankfully. Although we both work for the police department, our positions infrequently overlapped. I work in forensics, and she’s a uniformed officer. The times we did see each other, both assigned to the same crime scene, Taylor would give me a weak smile with a polite wave, and I would somberly reciprocate the gesture back at her.

Just another potential relationship ruined by my pareidolia.

\--------

Pareidolia: ***noun,*** \[pair-ahy-**doh**\-lee-*uh*\]

1) a situation in which someone sees a pattern or image of something that does not exist, for example, a face in a cloud.

\--------

I first saw that face about a decade ago, back when an actual person possessed it.

When I was nineteen, my family moved to a small town near my college. I didn’t love the arrangement. I mean, what freshman wants to be living with their parents? But I wasn’t paying my way through undergraduate, so I had little room to complain.

Ms. Besthet lived in the house across from us. From what I understand, she had been perfectly normal before we moved in. A pillar of the community, even.

She was in her late forties and worked as a professor of literary studies at my college. She went to church every Sunday, and she donated a quarter of her salary to the local children’s hospital. Ms. Besthet was childless and unmarried, but that was the only societal deficiency in her otherwise perfect record.

I never met *that* woman, though. I met someone else about a week after we moved in.

While unpacking my bedroom upstairs, I heard my mom calling me. She hollered for me to come down - one of our new neighbors had stopped by to introduce herself.

Jogging down the stairs, I followed the scent of freshly brewed coffee into the kitchen. Ms. Besthet was sitting at our table, her back to me as I approached.

*“Oh! And here he is now. This is my son, Grant,”* my mother remarked, lifting her mug and pointing it in my direction.

The middle-aged woman shifted in her chair, turning to meet me. At first, her expression was unremarkable; warm and friendly, nothing more. But when our eyes met, something changed. Ms. Besthet’s face twisted into a picture of ecstatic bliss. Her cheeks became rosy and flushed. Her eyes beamed, gleaming with undiluted euphoria. I think I even saw a tear trickle down the side of her nose before the effects of the stroke started to appear.

Love at first sight and its collateral damage, I guess.

As her brain swelled and suffocated, completely deprived of oxygen, Ms. Besthet’s face contorted from elation into the ghastly expression that has tormented me for the last ten years.

Without a word, she collapsed to the floor. My mother screamed for me to stay with Ms. Besthet as she hurried out of the kitchen, running to call 9-1-1 from her cell phone that had been charging in the living room.

Paralyzed from the abject horror of it all, I found myself unable to leave Ms. Besthet’s side, even though I certainly wanted to. Instead, I just stared at her, wondering if this odd woman was really about to die in front of me. Two words escaped from her lips before she lost consciousness, whispered from her crumpled position on the ground, her single open eye fixed squarely on me.

*“You’re mine.”*

\--------

Ms. Besthet didn’t die that day, but when she returned home from the hospital a month later, she was a different person, apparently.

To this day, I can’t figure out whether the stroke caused her newfound obsession, some bizarre manifestation of her brain damage, or whether her newfound obsession caused the stroke, desire short-circuiting her nervous system like an old car battery. I suppose the order doesn’t actually matter. Whatever happened that day, the end result was the same.

The woman had become downright infatuated with me.

Every afternoon, I’d see her at her front window, curtains wide open, waiting for me to return from class, anchoring her gaze to me the second I stepped out of my car. The stroke had damaged her nerves, leaving the left half of her face paralyzed. Meaning that, when she stared at me, it’d only be through her right eye, bulging from how intensely she was watching.

Months later, once her strength had more or less returned, Ms. Besthet resumed teaching at my college. Tried to resume teaching, at least. Sometimes she’d actually show up to her classes, sometimes she wouldn’t. As it would happen, the sessions she missed were during the times that I was also on campus. Instead of attending her own lectures, I’d catch her peering at me from around hallway corners or through the cracks of slightly opened doors, always scampering away once I caught on to her enamored surveillance.

The college didn’t fire her. Instead, without warning, she voluntarily resigned. The day after she quit, Ms. Besthet went missing. Disappeared without a trace. Didn’t pack a bag, didn’t take her car. She just vanished.

Many of my neighbors were worried sick, while I was secretly relieved. I didn’t care where she had gone, and I wasn’t preoccupied with the possibility that something bad had happened to her.

Wherever she was, Ms. Besthet was finally leaving me alone. 

Or she was being less obvious about it, at least.

A few quiet weeks passed before I heard a loud *thump* on our living room window, home alone while my parents were out of town. I had fallen asleep on the couch watching a movie, but the strange noise yanked me awake. My eyes, still hazy from sleep, looked over to a nearby digital clock, which showed the time was two in the morning. As my vision became clearer, I noticed something that made the hairs on the nape of my neck stand on end.

I saw the faint silhouette of a person, leaning against the living room window from the outside. Not only that, but they had pressed their body so hard against the glass that the sound of it had woken me up.

Terror vibrating in the back of my throat, I crept over to the window. The bright flickering images from our wide-screen TV cast inky shadows that danced over me as I moved through the room. When I finally stood in front of the silhouette, inches away from the glass, my entire body buzzed with fear and anticipation.

I twisted the blinds open.

But, to my surprise, there was no one there. All I saw through that window was an empty cul-de-sac, dimly lit by phosphorescent streetlights.

An involuntary sigh of relief billowed from my lungs, and I let the tension in shoulders fall like an avalanche of muscle and ligament down below my collarbone.

The relief didn’t last.

When I was about to turn away, I noticed a smudge on the glass. It wasn’t easy to see in the low light, but once I saw it, I couldn’t look away. I tried to suppress my recognition of the shape, but it was too perfectly identical to be anything other than an imprint of Ms. Besthet’s face.

Two months later, some kids stumbled upon a decomposing body in the woods behind my house.

According to the police, it looked like Ms. Besthet had been living there since her disappearance. The authorities eventually ruled her death a tragic accident; starvation in the setting of psychosis.

I wouldn’t learn this until years later, but the only thing she had on her person when she expired was a polaroid camera. A detective that worked the case let that fact slip in passing, gushing about how strange it all was, unaware that I lived less than a hundred yards from where the woman had simply laid down and died.

When I asked him if she had any photos with her, he refused to tell me more.

*"I've said too much already, sorry."*

\--------

From a dating perspective, my twenties have been hellish. Echoes of Ms. Besthet’s face have stalked me since the day she died. Under normal circumstances, it’s an infrequent disturbance. Once a month, maybe. But if I ever find myself flirting, though, imprints of her face will start proliferating in my surroundings, swirling around me like a swarm of wasps.

And if I’m ever stupid enough to actually go on a date? Multiply all of that by twenty.

Not to mention the goddamned itch. In the end, that’s what really stopped me from pursuing romance. I think I could ignore the faces; however numerous they’d become. It’d be difficult, but I could do it. The itch is a different story. At peak intensity, it’s like my skin is burning from an invisible fire that won’t go out. The discomfort can completely overwhelm me to the point where I would do anything to make it stop.

So, I’ve resigned myself to isolation. Dating just hasn’t been worth the pain. It’s been lonely, sure, but abstaining has kept me safe and relatively sane. Meeting Taylor, however, changed things. Taylor rekindled something inside me that I believed was completely extinguished before I met her. She made me want to fight back.

That was delusional.

A misjudgment I won’t be making again.

\--------

Over the last two weeks, I’ve been daydreaming about Taylor. We’ve had some casual conversations since that disaster of a first date, and I realized that I’ve given her nothing in the way of an explanation for my behavior that night.

Yesterday, though, I made a resolution.

I would ask Taylor to meet me for coffee the day *after* Valentine’s Day. Asking her to coffee *on* Valentine’s Day would be a little strange, I thought. I didn’t plan on explaining everything to her, but I could at least apologize for leaving her high and dry. Maybe pay her back for dinner and the Uber. If she seemed receptive to all that, and if I found a bit of courage, maybe I’d ask her if she was willing to give us another try.

Satisfied with the plan, I continued through my workday.

A few hours later, I was called in to assist with a case - a dead body discovered in the middle of a nearby park that had everyone scratching their heads.

When I arrived on scene, I understood their confusion.

The corpse was propped up against a tree, its details initially obscured by the tree’s shadow. Honestly, it was hard to even tell it was a human body from where I parked, which was only twenty feet away. At that distance, the thing looked more like a burlap sack filled with ground beef than it did a human cadaver.

When I approached, however, I started to appreciate its humanity. A fractured bone jutting out here, a few fingers poking out there. Somehow, the corpse had been twisted into an incomprehensible sphere of mangled flesh and bone. It was like God had taken this poor soul, placed them between the palms of their comet-sized hands, and rolled them until they were molded into a ball like human pizza dough.

But that wasn’t even the strangest part: the corpse lacked decay, meaning that whoever they were, they were freshly dead. Our lead detective had initially assumed that we were standing on the crime scene, given how recently we had presumed they died. At the same time, the scene was *completely* bloodless, which argued against that theory. Not a speck of it on them, not a speck of it around the tree.

No blood that we could see, at least. Despite what we all see in the movies, blood sprays aren’t always obvious.

I opened my forensics toolbag and pulled a spray bottle of luminol from it. If there was even a drop to be found, the chemical would react with it, oxidizing the molecular iron present in blood, resulting in a faint blue glow. Thankfully, the large tree’s shadow completely covered the victim. To properly see the glow, I needed the area to be dark.

As the liquid contacted the corpse, parts of it did glow. 

Moments later, the lead detective put a gentle hand on my shoulder and said something that nearly caused me to pass out. I hadn’t heard him approach, transfixed by the shape that had appeared after I sprayed the luminol.

*“We found the victim’s wallet in the nearby brush. I think…I think you knew her.”*

I didn’t need him to continue, but I didn’t stop him, either. When I saw the imprint of Ms. Besthet’s face glowing on the corpse like a cosmic stamp of approval, I already knew what he was about to tell me.

*“It’s…it’s Taylor.”*

My memory of the next few minutes is a bit jumbled. I have a very fuzzy recollection of driving home. It consists mostly of my own feral screams filling the car with unearthly noise, rather than a memory of the drive itself.

Everything becomes clear again when I walked through the door of my apartment. As soon as my foot passed that threshold, I felt the phantom itch abruptly manifest on the small of my back, worse than it’s ever been before. Struggling to move, I stumbled through my apartment, scratching wildly at the area as I did, clawing at the skin with reckless abandon. Eventually, I made my way into the bathroom.

As I unbuttoned my shirt, an entirely new pain came into being. It wasn’t the pins and needles of an unmanaged itch; the discomfort was too sharp. It caused me to double over in agony, leaning my elbow against the rim of the sink to keep myself upright. I wasn't even scratching anymore, and yet the pain was still escalating, as if I was manually peeling thick strips of meat from around my spine with my hands. I felt the tearing sensation making a line across my skin, inch by tortuous inch.

In a frenzy, I ripped my shirt off and turned my back towards the mirror, desperate to identify the source of the new pain. What I witnessed in that moment broke me completely.

A laceration was forming, completely on its own, unzipping layers of skin before my eyes, the tissue audibly splitting and popping in my ears.

Above the impossible wound, there was a single brown mole about the size of a nickel. There was also an old scar from a biking injury, below the mole but above the laceration; a fibrinous line running between the two landmarks, connecting them to each other.

An eye, a hooked nose, and a bloody smirk.

As I noticed it, the lacerating paused, and the room became quiet.

I watched helplessly as the lips of the gash began moving, causing jolts of debilitating pain to radiate through my back, silently mouthing those two horrible words.

*“You’re mine.”*
