It started with a smell. A faint, metallic tang that Alex first noticed on the bus ride home. He assumed it was someone else—a stranger with bloodied knuckles or rust-stained clothes—but it clung to him long after he stepped off. It followed him up the stairs to his apartment, trailing behind him like a guilty conscience.

Inside, the smell intensified.

His apartment was pristine. No dishes in the sink, no laundry piled up. Still, the metallic tang lingered. It reminded him of pennies, or the coppery taste of his own blood after biting his lip too hard.

He checked the faucets. Dry.

He checked his hands. Clean.

The smell wasn’t coming from anywhere external, and yet, it surrounded him, growing stronger with each passing hour. He opened a window, lit a candle, even sprayed air freshener, but nothing helped.

By midnight, the smell was unbearable.

That’s when the humming began.

It was so faint at first, Alex thought he was imagining it. A low, droning sound, like an electrical hum buried beneath layers of static. It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once, vibrating just below the threshold of audibility.

He lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, the hum worming its way into his skull. It didn’t stop when he covered his ears. It grew louder, deeper, resonating in his bones.

And then came the voice.

Not a voice, exactly. Not something external. It was more like a thought—something that arrived uninvited, as though his mind had produced it without his consent.

"Are you sure you locked the door?"

Alex sat up, his pulse quickening. The question felt so real, so intrusive, that he instinctively glanced at his bedroom door. It was closed.

"Go check."

His chest tightened. It didn’t feel like his own thought. It felt alien, invasive. But the longer he ignored it, the louder it became, repeating over and over.

"Go check. Go check. Go check."

He stumbled out of bed, his legs shaky, and went to the front door. It was locked. He turned the bolt for good measure, then stood there in the silence, breathing heavily.

But the voice didn’t stop.

"The windows. Did you lock the windows?"

He checked them.

"The closet. Are you sure no one’s in the closet?"

He opened it. Empty.

By the time dawn broke, Alex was sitting in the middle of his living room, surrounded by furniture he’d pushed against every door and window. His body was trembling, his mind fraying.

The next day at work, Alex couldn’t focus. The hum followed him. The voice whispered, faint but insistent, intruding on his thoughts.

"She’s staring at you. She knows."

He glanced at his coworker, a woman sitting two desks over. She wasn’t looking at him.

"She knows what you did. Look at her hands."

He stared at her hands. They were perfectly normal. Typing.

"She’s going to tell. Stop her before she does."

He clenched his fists, fighting back the urge to yell. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real.

The voice grew louder over the following weeks. More intrusive. More specific.

"Do you remember that time you left him crying? Alone? In the dark?"

"What?" Alex whispered, his voice barely audible.

"You do. You remember how he begged. How his little hands reached for you, and you turned away."

"I don’t—I didn’t—"

But the memory came rushing back, unbidden. He was seven. His little brother was three. Alex had locked him in the basement as a prank and left him there, screaming, until their mother came home.

He hadn’t thought about it in years.

Now it consumed him.

The hum grew louder. The smell of blood returned, stronger than ever. And the voice wouldn’t stop.

"He cried for hours, Alex. You didn’t even care. You laughed."

"I was a kid!" he shouted, tears streaming down his face. "I didn’t mean it!"

"But you remember, don’t you? The sound of him crying? The way his voice cracked? He remembers too."

"No, he doesn’t," Alex whispered. "He doesn’t even talk about it."

"Because he’s dead."

Alex froze. His brother wasn’t dead. He was alive, married, living two states away.

"Is he?"

The voice laughed, a horrible, wet sound that echoed inside Alex’s skull.

By the end of the month, Alex had stopped sleeping. The voice was constant now, a relentless stream of accusations and questions. Every intrusive thought he’d ever suppressed was dredged up, magnified, twisted into something unbearable.

"You don’t deserve peace. You know that, don’t you?"

His reflection in the mirror began to change. At first, it was subtle: a flicker of movement when he was still, a shadow passing over his face. But soon, it became undeniable. His reflection smiled when he didn’t. Its eyes lingered, watching him even as he turned away.

He smashed the mirror, but it didn’t help.

He started seeing things in the corner of his vision: dark shapes, indistinct figures that disappeared when he turned to look. The smell of blood filled every room. The hum was deafening.

One night, Alex’s phone buzzed. It was a text from his brother.

"Are you okay?"

He stared at the screen, his hands trembling.

"I had a weird dream about you. You were... I don’t know. Different. Angry. I just wanted to check in."

Alex tried to type a reply, but his hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

Then, another text came through.

"Do you remember the basement?"

Alex dropped the phone.

He didn’t sleep that night.

When dawn came, he found himself staring at the kitchen knife on the counter. The voice was calm now, almost soothing.

"You can make it stop. All of it. Just one little cut."

For the first time in weeks, Alex felt a sense of relief.

"And maybe," the voice whispered, "you’ll finally deserve peace."
