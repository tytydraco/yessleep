There was no sign above the door, just a small light flickering above black-painted brick. The man at the entrance didn’t ask for my name. He opened the door like I was on time for something I didn’t know I’d agreed to.
Inside, the light changed—golden, soft, too clean. The maître d’ appeared without a sound. He wore a sharp, dark suit, not a wrinkle on it, and turned before I could speak. I followed him down a narrow corridor lined with portraits: faces in sepia, evenly spaced, framed identically. They looked like paintings of people trying to remember what they were supposed to be.

The dining room revealed itself suddenly.

A wide, windowless space. Tables spaced out like coordinates on a quiet map. Each one lit by a single, warm light from directly overhead. The rest of the room was shadow. The floor beneath me gleamed black, reflecting just enough to make you uncertain if anything was really touching the ground.

Each diner sat alone.

Formal. Still. Their movements, when they happened, were deliberate—lips parting in slow bites, forks raised as if awaiting permission. There was no music. Just the distant sound of water being poured, and the faint hum of something beneath the floor.

No one made eye contact.

The servers moved quickly. Almost too quickly. Their trays were large, polished, nearly too big for one hand, but they never tipped. Their suits were immaculate. Their gloves white. Their faces… heavy. Drooping at the edges, like wax figures under heat. Eyes half-lidded, expressions fixed somewhere between exhaustion and indifference. You could mistake them for statues until they moved.

The kitchen was visible only through a thin horizontal slit in the back wall.

From time to time, the doors would swing open just wide enough to see inside.

White. Blindingly white.

The chefs moved like machinery—coordinated, frantic, never frantic-looking. One plated something invisible. Another stirred a pot without touching it. One reached for something overhead, and for a second, their eyes met mine through the glass. Then the door swung shut.

The first course arrived.

A single, pale shape in the center of an enormous plate. Rounded. Trembling slightly. It tasted like a hallway I hadn’t walked down in years. Like something I lost and decided not to look for. It dissolved the moment I chewed.

The second course arrived before I’d finished the first.

It was cold. Thin slices of something folded over themselves in the shape of a spiral. At the center, a silver pin. I stared at it for a moment before realizing it wasn’t decoration. It was part of the meal.

Across the room, a diner stood up, slowly. Their face had changed—slackened, sagging slightly to one side. Not grotesque, just… softened. Like a sketch left in the rain. They smoothed their shirt, bowed slightly to no one, and walked out through the same hallway I’d entered.

No one reacted.

I waited for a third course, but it never came.

Instead, the lights above my table dimmed by a single degree. Enough to notice. Not enough to be sure.

I looked down at my plate. It was clean. I don’t remember finishing it.

I stood up. The maître d’ was gone. The room was quieter now. I passed back through the corridor of portraits.

One caught my eye.

It hadn’t been there before.

The lighting was colder, the angle different. But the face was unmistakable. Not exactly mine—but close. Close enough to feel like a memory of me someone else might have described. The chin too sharp. The eyes wrong. The expression neutral in a way I’d never seen on myself.

But it was me.

I left the restaurant. The door shut behind me without a sound. The street was still empty. My phone buzzed once, then stopped. The sky looked flat, like a matte painting.

I walked home.

Sat at the table.

Stared at my hands.

They looked… different.

Not older. Just less mine.

I stayed like that for a long time.
