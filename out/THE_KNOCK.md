It all started with a knock at exactly 3 AM. At first I thought that it's my imagination then I thought that it's coming from the window outside. I thought it's the wind making noises in the window pane. I didn't mind it. It didn't even disturb me. I'm a heavy sleeper anyway. Mostly I slept through the knock. But tonight was it different...

I moved into this apartment almost 15 days ago. It's a pretty decent apartment. Everything about it is perfect. It's close to my college, it's nice and cozy, rent is affordable and most importantly it's fully furnished. Even though the furnitures were abandoned by the previous owner it's alright for a college student like me. Because I can't afford to buy new furnitures right now. The abandoned furnitures were in pristine condition. The bed, the almirah full of clothes, the kitchen utensils, books it's almost like the previous owner vanished into thin air. The most beautiful thing in this apartment was the vintage Mirror in the front wall of the bed. The frame is made of brass and a snake or dragon like design around its rim. So beautiful and powerful. It's like the mirror wants to attract you. 

I was very happy to get an apartment like this. It's like a dream come true. I moved in eagerly. In the first night I invited my friends over. We celebrated about my new appartment. They went home around 2:30 AM. I was washing the plates in the kitchen when I first heard the knock. I thought that maybe one of my friends forgot something that's why they returned so I opened the front door. There was no one. A cold gush of wind brushed through my hair and a shiver ran down my spine. I closed the front door and sat down on the sofa. I thought maybe I imagined that. I was already very tired from all the shifting and celebration. So I hurriedly went to bed.

 Next night I was rearranging the furnitures when I heard it again. This time it felt like the knock came from inside the apartment. I checked the clock it was exactly 3 AM. I searched everywhere in the apartment. Under the bed inside the almirah in the bathroom behind the mirror you name it. But I didn't find any thing out of ordinary. Third fourth and fifth night was uneventful or maybe I slept through it. On the sixth night it happened again. I was in the living room working on my laptop. And the knock came from the bedroom. I thought maybe it's the wind. I don't know why but I didn't even bother to check it out this time. I should have seen the signs. Like this it went on. 

Last night I was in my bedroom when it happened. I was working on my laptop. I thought the knock came from the window beside the mirror. I thought maybe one of my friends are playing some kind of sick joke with me. Today in the morning I asked one of my friend, who worked at a bar that is just 10 minutes from my apartment , about it. He said that he didn't even go to work for the past 15 Days. He went to his mother's house. I also asked the landlord about it. He said the there is no record of this kind of paranormal activity in this apartment. The previous person who rented this house just left the country or something like that. I thought I was losing my mind. I even booked an appointment to a psychologist on my way home. Tonight I was really tired so I fell asleep earlier than usual. 

Around 3 AM I woke up by the same knock. This time I really wanted to find out the source of the knock. I searched every nook and cranny of my apartment. I gave up after searching for a while and stood by the open window. Then I heard it again this time it came from my left side. It seemed like it came from the mirror. Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw next. When I looked at the mirror I saw myself creepily smiling and knocking at the mirror glass from inside the mirror. It wasn't like any other reflection it was like a whole new world behind that glass.

 Now that I think about it the mirror always creeped me out. Something about it's reflection was odd. Sometimes it felt like it's lagging behind and sometimes it felt like the reflection had more depth to it. Back then I thought that it's my imagination but now I'm sure that it was not.

After I saw the mirror I stumbled from shock and fell back. I tried to run but.. I saw my reflection's hand emerge from the mirror. To try and grab me.

After that I lost my concious. When I woke up I was laying in my bed. I thought maybe it was a nightmare but when I looked at the mirror it was completely dark and the most important thing is that the mirror was at the right side of the window. And now I finally understand where the previous owner went.
