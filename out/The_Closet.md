I was eleven when my parents purchased a house on the other side of town. It was a newly renovated two-story home in the historic district, where streets were paved with real brick and where the median income within a ten-mile radius of our front lawn jumped by a tax bracket or two compared to where we had lived before. We weren’t strapped for cash to begin with, but my father’s promotion to the glittering office of middle manager at his company still ushered in a completely different world. The sidewalks in our new neighborhood remained without cracks, no tufts of grass or lone dandelions sprouting out from jagged spaces in the concrete. Stop signs were replaced with roundabouts. The local high school had a lacrosse team. 

This was all thrilling in its own right but to my preteen brain, nothing could beat seeing my new room for the first time. Not only was it more than twice the size of my old room with a large circular window overlooking the street, but it even came with a walk-in closet so large that all my moving boxes only took up about half the available space. According to my father who got the information from our realtor, a smarmy-looking thirty-five-year-old man in a blue suit, an undercut, and a beard shaped far too precisely, my room used to be the master bedroom before three more additions were made to the house, each by a new owner of the property. 

My sister Chelsea, who was nine at the time, was jealous that I got the bigger closet, but my mother assuaged her temper by explaining that she had the bigger room as a whole, on top of being closer to the bathroom. This seemed to satisfy Chelsea’s nine-year-old logic for the time being. In the end, I’m glad she never got my room. I shudder to think of what would have happened if she did. 

The first two weeks in the house were relatively uneventful. My parents had moved us in June since I’d be starting sixth grade in the fall, and they thought it best to give Chelsea and I a fresh start on the school year. I mostly spent my time unpacking the occasional box or two, watching television, playing video games with my sister, and just generally staying out of the way. I made myself especially scarce in the evenings, largely due to the severe change in my father’s mood, which had started long before we moved, really ever since he got promoted. Of all the things in our new life, this was my least favorite. That was, until something new came to take its place.  

Slowly, Dad had started smiling less, laughing less, speaking less. His sentences grew short and clipped and gruff. When he got home for the day at 7 p.m. after a twelve hour work day, he carried a suffocating energy that followed him in from the garage. It felt like there was an invisible landmine waiting to go off if we ever stepped wrong, so Chelsea and I generally opted not to step at all. He was curt and he complained more. Years later, with the wisdom of hindsight, I mostly feel bad for my mother, who took it all in silence as he criticized the dinner I had seen her spend two hours preparing.

Before I knew any better, I did feel sympathetic toward him, and I learned to hate the job that seemed to suck the life out of him for twelve hours a day and send him home either dead-eyed or angry with a loosened tie, rolled up sleeves, and creases in his forehead to match the dark bags under his eyes. But now, in adulthood, I don’t feel bad for him at all. 

No one forced him to take that job. We were doing fine in our old house, in our old life, and we were happy. No one threatened him at gunpoint to double his hours for double the pay and double the responsibility and quadruple the stress. No one forced him to be mean, cynical, or cruel. He took that duty upon himself. Because he very well couldn’t take his frustration out on his boss, lest he lose the new car and house and status he’d worked so hard to obtain. But he could take it out on us. Because we were there. And it was easy.

Those two weeks in June spent quietly on the periphery of my parents’ lives came to an abrupt end when I started to notice something strange about my room. I’m still not sure how long it had been occurring, but I realized one morning when I awoke, my closet door was ever so slightly ajar. I was a skittish kid and had lived most of my early childhood with a deathly fear of the dark. For that reason, I had developed a habit of always shutting my closet door before going to sleep, a habit that I’d maintained long after my father had taken away my night light and I had grown old enough to know better. And yet, there it was. An open door, cracked about an inch, a solid black line looking out from the darkness of the cavernous walk-in.

While I was a bit creeped out, that old childlike fear of the dark worming back into my chest, I largely chalked it up to the frenzy of the move-in that had left me scatterbrained and out of my regular habits. The next few nights, I made sure to close the door before I went to sleep, even writing a reminder to myself on a sticky note attached to my bedside lamp. But it kept happening, and each morning after I opened my eyes and stretched and sat up in bed, I’d turn my head to see what I had come to expect. My closet door, open, almost a bit wider each time as if it was… mocking me. In my growing confusion and paranoia, I asked my father for help, who shrugged with his hands on his hips as he inspected the doorframe in my room one day after work. 

“It’s an old house,” he said. “The frame probably shifts when we run the A/C, or when it’s really windy. Or something.” He shrugged again. Then he left.

Even at eleven, I was starting to realize that not every adult necessarily has the correct answers, and that they’ll usually feed you a stream of bullshit before ever admitting that they don’t know something. But I would have been insane to challenge my dad’s knowledge on the matter, so I let it lie. What could I do? I was a kid. I guess it was the A/C. Or the wind. Or something.

The open-door phenomenon continued for another few nights, and I had gradually started to slip into a routine. Every night I’d close the door, every morning it was open, and every morning I would hop out of bed to close it. Strangely enough, this whole process eventually began to help my fear of the dark, since finding the door open every morning and yet finding myself unharmed was a sort of proof that maybe nothing bad would happen after all. I’ve been wrong about a lot of things in my life, but I was wrong about that most of all.

After about a week and a half of this, I awoke in the middle of the night, roused from my sleep by a low, even sound, one I hadn’t yet heard, or at least hadn’t yet been *awake* to hear since all of this had started. It sounded like… breathing? No, it wasn’t quite breathing so much as wheezing. A scratchy, gurgling breathing that sounded labored and whistling and wet. Almost like a wounded animal, but somehow more human. My eyes scanned the room, shadows cast this way and that by the moonlight streaming in through the big circular window. 

My gaze landed on the closet door, which of course was slightly ajar, the open slit of solid black becoming clearer as my eyes adjusted to the darkness. There was the sound, the shallow breathing. And it was coming from my closet, from right behind the door. My heart quickened as panic set in, and I jumped out of bed and wrenched open the bedroom door to do something I never would have done had I not been so scared: I bothered my dad after bedtime on a weeknight. 

I found him sprawled out in his recliner, watching a movie, an empty beer bottle on the side table next to him and a half-finished one in his hand. I approached with trepidation, tugging at the hem of my big sleep shirt to calm my nerves. The old hardwood floor of the living room floor felt cold on my bare feet.

“What is it kiddo?”

“There’s something…” I started. What was I going to say? That there was something breathing behind my closet door? He’d never come if I said that. “…wrong. With my closet.”

“I told you, it’s just an old—”

“Can you just come check?” I asked, my voice going up an octave. “*Please*?”

My dad said nothing in response besides a grunt, but he got up, leading the way up the stairs as I followed from a healthy distance. When he reached the door and flicked on the lights, he stopped so abruptly that I almost ran into his back. He turned toward me so that I could see into the room, framed by the angry look in his eyes looming over the scene. My closet door was closed. And the room was deathly silent.

“Something’s wrong with it?”

“It was… the door was open when I—”

“You need to grow up, Kenny,” my dad interrupted, brushing past me and heading toward the stairs. “It’s just the dark. Stop acting like a baby.”

“It was open dad, there was something there,” I replied from the entrance to my bedroom, trying to stay level-headed.

“Go to bed,” he shot back as he turned to head downstairs.

“But—”

“*Go*,” Dad said, his voice now loud and full of anger and brandishing his finger at me. Then he lowered his voice, likely realizing that my sister and mom were already asleep just down the hall. “to bed. *Now*.”

Then he was gone. And I was alone again. I stood in the doorway for what felt like eternity, but I knew that eventually I’d have to make a decision, and I very well couldn’t go back down to the living room. I stayed awake for as long as I could that night, never going near my closet door, sitting with my back to the wall with my knees curled up toward my chest, but I eventually nodded off sometime in the early morning, only to awake to my closet door open once more. 

I nearly fell down the stairs from how fast I ran from my room down to breakfast, and I spent the rest of the day playing outside, dreading having to go to sleep again. But I couldn’t ask my parents if I could sleep on the couch - they’d outright refuse - and I couldn’t switch rooms with Chelsea, who would just be in the same position I now found myself in. I didn’t have any power. Eventually I had to face the music and go to bed.

I was woken up again that night by the breathing, that shallow, constant wheezing which froze me in place with terror as I pulled the covers up to my chin. My eyes flicked toward the bedroom door, finding the light that usually drifted upstairs from the living room painfully absent. My parents were already in bed. For a while, I pretended not to hear it, not to see it. But the breathing remained there, steadily droning on. 

Something had to be done, but I knew that I could no longer find solace in my father. In the end, I *never* could. I was all alone. I finally summoned the courage to get out of bed, tiptoeing across the room and fishing around in one of my open half-unpacked moving boxes. Eventually, my hand closed around a cylinder of plastic, and I pulled my arm out of the box to produce my flashlight. The shallow, wheezing breath continued as I turned the flashlight on and pivoted toward the closet, sweeping the beam across the opening in the door. At first, the light didn’t catch anything, and for a second I thought that maybe all these sounds really were just in my head, and that I was starting to go crazy. But then, when the beam caught the door just right, I saw two eyes, glittering and gray and bloodshot and sickly. And two rows of teeth. Smiling at me.

The next thing I knew, I was banging on my parents’ door, screaming at the top of my lungs, begging for them to help. I remember the terror even now, so pure and white and all-consuming that I forgot my nerves or fear of judgement as I whaled against the wood. My last strike hit only air as my dad whipped open the door, fury in his eyes. He didn’t even want to hear my pleas or my explanations. He was done. Grabbing me by the wrist, he pulled me down the hallway toward my room, past Chelsea, who was standing in the hallway, rubbing sleep from her eyes.

I tugged in the opposite direction, my heart pounding at the thought of going back to that room, but my father’s grip was strong, and my effort only made my wrist hurt more. That hallway felt a mile long, but we finally reached my room, where my closet of course was already closed. I had come to expect it, but the sight made my heart both sink with disappointment and patter with apprehension. But my father didn’t stop at the doorway, instead dragging me all the way across the room and toward… my closet. I realized too late what he was planning to do and took up my struggle against his grip once more, straining and pulling in desperation like an animal caught in a trap.

“Dad,” I said, my bare heels digging and squeaking and slipping against the hardwood floor as he dragged me. “Please don’t.”

I could hear my mother behind us, still in the doorway, trying to calm the situation, only to be batted away like a fly. 

“Mike… maybe we should cool down and—”

“He needs to learn!” Dad shouted back at her, and somewhere further down the hall I could hear Chelsea start to cry in fright, which didn’t stop him in the least. Then, he whirled toward the closet, yanking the door open and then bending down toward me, his hand still firmly fastened on my wrist. “I’ll see you in the morning—”

“Dad, please don’t do this—”

“—and when I do, I don’t want to hear any more about your goddamn closet—”

“Dad, don’t—”

Then he flung me into the dark little cupboard of a room, slamming the door behind me before I could get up. Outside, amidst the shrill sounds of argument between my parents and the wails of my sister, I could hear my dad sliding my desk chair across the floor and wedging it underneath the door handle. I finally climbed to my feet, pounding against the door and pleading with my father like a soldier in front of the firing squad, that I would do anything, anything at all for him to let me go. But eventually the sounds from my room dulled as they were carried out into the hallway and my surroundings grew still and quiet, save for my own shaky breath and the occasional sniffle as I wiped my tear-stained cheeks with the back of my hand.

I slid to the floor, my back against the wall, nursing my wrist, which sported a dull throb that promised to bruise the next day. Then it dawned on me all at once what had happened and where I presently found myself. In the closet, with that… thing. The panic crept up through the bottom of my stomach, ice cold and sharp as a knife jutting upward through my abdomen. My hands began to shake, and I lowered them to my sides as they brushed against… my flashlight! I must have shoved it in the pocket of my pajama pants before running to my parents, and my father hadn’t noticed the form of it in his flurry of activity.

I fumbled for a second before my thumb found the button and I breathed a sigh of relief. The beam sputtered for a second, likely from the jostling of the batteries when I fell to the floor, but then it held strong. I swept the beam across the back of the closet from my position by the door, but I couldn’t find anything besides old cardboard boxes. Somehow, I managed to shuffle forward, one small step after the other, but all I could find was the junk I had brought in from our old home in various states of disarray. The closet was in fact so completely devoid of the extraordinary that it felt even more chilling juxtaposed to the… thing… that I had just seen inside moments ago.

I finally reached the back wall, still finding nothing of interest in the closet, nothing at all, nothing except… my breath caught in my throat as the beam of the flashlight landed on the back wall, finding a series of horizontal scratches running across the drywall and peeking out from behind a stack of boxes. They wouldn’t have been noticed unless you were looking and primed to see them, and they were especially accentuated by the blue-white light of the flashlight beam.

I scooted the boxes out of the way and knelt before the scratches, reaching out with a trembling hand and pushing slightly against that wall until it buckled and gave way, revealing a square hole in the back of the closet that only a child or small adult could fit through. I felt sick to my stomach, but my curiosity got the better of me, so I slid the panel sideways to rest against the interior wall of the new compartment. Judging from the scratches that had initially alerted me, this had been done dozens, maybe hundreds of times before.

I swung the light this way and that but only found walls of metal across from me and to my immediate sides. It was only when I angled the beam downward that I realized the floor fell away below, descending down through the walls of the house, ending somewhere I couldn’t see. It was a tunnel, and on further inspection, I could see small hand- and foot-holds chiseled into the sides. It’s been some time since that horrible night, and thinking back to it, I can only guess that the tunnel had once been a laundry chute, leading down from the original master bedroom to somewhere in the basement. Given the series of renovations and additions to the house over the decades, my bedroom must have been a bit larger in its early years, but the construction of the walk-in closet had sectioned the chute off from the room and papered it over with drywall.

I wasn’t thinking about any of this at eleven. All I saw when I discovered that tunnel was my escape, no matter how slim, no matter that this new revelation should have brought a new terror in realizing that just as I could get *out* of my closet, surely something else could get *in*. Try to explain to a man dying of thirst that he surely shouldn’t drink salt water and see how well you appeal to his logic then.

At the time, I thought the tunnel must end either near the kitchen or in the basement, so I tucked my flashlight under my chin and descended, using the haphazardly constructed holds to slowly but surely work my way downward. Every few seconds, I expected to arrive at a lower room in the house, but I simply… didn’t. On and on it went. Due to how narrow it was, I couldn’t quite crane my head to see below my feet, but I continued on, hoping that I would eventually hit something solid.

But the tunnel continued lower and lower, and the sunk cost fallacy in my child mind caused me to panic at the sense that I had already gone too far and couldn’t turn back. My anxiety only increased when the metallic holds on the side of the chute ended and switched to wood, then, after a while, switched again to wet, yet firm earth. I only had moments to process this swift change before my feet finally hit ground, and I felt loose, cold dirt on the bottoms of my bare feet. I didn’t need anything else to tell me that I had descended down through the walls to land somewhere below the foundation of the house. If the chute had ever ended in the basement, it surely didn’t anymore.

I turned about slowly, and swung my flashlight beam outward to show yet another tunnel, this one instead framed completely by rock and dirt, with a floor that sloped subtly downward into the earth. Further and further and further. The sight of it was all I needed for the dread I had been staving off during my descent to take full bloom, and I turned back toward the chute, on the verge of hyperventilating, when I heard it… the breathing. It started quietly, with an echoing quality that indicated it was somewhere far off down the tunnel. But it began to grow louder. And louder. The wet wheezing, accompanied by… shuffling feet in loose dirt and gravel. I realized all too late that the thing from my closet wasn’t just breathing back there. It was headed my way. 

Just then, a putrid smell filled the air, like rotten flesh had been left to bake in the sun, and I covered my mouth and nose while I retched, fighting off a spell of vomiting that would surely cost me precious time in escaping. I scrambled back toward the tunnel in a craze, scurrying up the handholds as I scrambled for my life back up toward my bedroom. I could hear my own frantic breathing echoing in the tunnel, matched only by the gurgling of the thing behind me, ringing up toward me from behind. I could hear the methodical, dull thud of feet and hands on the holds in the chute. It was climbing up after me. Somehow, I made it back up to the closet, crawling out of the hole in the wall like a frightened cockroach. As soon as I had climbed to my feet, I took a running jump at the door, slamming my entire body against the wood as I screamed for someone, anyone to help, to let me out, to save me. But no one came.

Over and over again I threw my weight against the door, but my scrawny frame combined with the chair jammed under the handle made it virtually impossible. My shoulders and hands began to pulse with pain and scream at me to stop but my terror grew with the sound of the breathing that was growing louder, louder, louder until it was right there in the room with me. I spun toward the back of my closet, my trembling hand pointing the sputtering beam of my flashlight at the wall, only to see an arm reach in through the hole. It had the palest skin I’d ever seen, dotted by blotches of red rashes and patches of blisters snaking along its surface. The arm was followed into the room by the top of the thing’s head, just as pale as the rest of its skin, bald save for a few greasy, stringy wisps of hair that dangled toward the floor. Using the last reserves of my bravery, I backed up from the door, preparing to throw my weight against it like never before. I ran toward the door screaming, only to see it open at the last second before I was to collide with it. I saw Chelsea, her hand on the outer handle, tears in her eyes and on her cheeks, before I completely bowled her over, landing against her in a painful heap on the floor.  

My father, hearing the cries of my sister, was in the room in a flash, shouting incoherently at me and grabbing a fistful of my shirt. He raised an open hand above me, ready, for the first time in my entire life, to actually hit me. Then he paused. Because in that brief moment, he finally heard it. He heard the breathing, deep from within my closet. He looked to the side, peering into my closet and saw, just like my sister and I, the pale, grotesque arm slink back into the compartment in the wall. His grip on my shirt loosened, and then he looked down at me, really seeing me for the first time since we’d moved, and maybe for the first time in his life. I couldn’t tell what his face looked like after that, as I closed my eyes, resting my head against the floor of my bedroom, breathing, for the first time all night, a genuine sigh of relief. 

Because he had finally seen. And he finally believed me. And I finally wasn’t alone.

\---------------------------------------

My parents had called the police immediately, taking my sister and I from that house, but it didn’t fix the damage already done somewhere deep within my heart, a distance placed there by my father which felt like an ever-expanding gulf that grew with time.  

We stayed in a hotel during the following weeks while the police led a search down into the tunnels below our house, joined by my father in his attempt at atonement. They took it slow and steady so as to not cause unexpected cave-ins, and the tunnel ended up going on for miles, descending ever deeper into the earth. But in all that time, they never found the thing that had used the tunnels to visit me during the night. Not even a trace. Eventually the search party found the tunnel sealed, a large wall of caved-in rocks blocking any forward progression. Whether the tunnel collapsed naturally or intentionally, they couldn’t be sure, but I’m positive that whatever the creature was, it wanted to ensure that it would never be found. 

That’s what has stuck with me most about the experience all these years later. The thing that haunted me from my closet, whether human or otherwise, is still out there. We’ve moved houses and states since then, and my job in adulthood has taken me abroad for a number of years. And yet, deep in the middle of the night, when I’m having trouble sleeping, I can’t stop looking at my closet, which I tie shut with bungee cords every evening before I go to bed. I keep expecting it to open, just barely, just a crack. And through that opening, I’d see it. Those eyes, those teeth, that diseased inhuman skin, all accompanied by a rancid smell and that slow methodical breathing. Shallow, wet, and wheezing. Letting me know that it’s still there, watching, and that it never plans on leaving.
