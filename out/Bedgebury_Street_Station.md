My name is Jackson, and what I experienced is something I would never wish on anyone. Ever. 

A little backstory. I live in New York and I usually drive to work through the Holland Tunnel everyday under the Hudson River. However, a few weeks ago now, my car was completely destroyed when a speeding car drove straight into it outside my house and it was written off. The insurance were pissing me around and it wasn’t like I could afford a new car, so I decided I’d have to get the bus to work for however long it took to get the insurance claim. 

So, after some irritable thinking, I decided I had no choice other than to take the subway, which I usually avoid at all costs. But it was either take the subway for a few weeks or lose my job. So, after some research I decided I’d have to be on the 7:43AM train from Bedgebury Street Station. The next morning, in a bad mood, I woke up early and got ready for work. I headed for the subway station and it was unusually quiet in the streets, which I just put down as rush hour not quite starting yet. As I headed down the stairs into the subway, my footsteps echoed for such a long way, which gave me a slightly eerie feeling. I got into the ticket office and found there was no one in there, and the windows all had blinds down. Deciding what to do, it suddenly caught my attention that the ticket barrier were open. 

I headed through them and down to the platforms, the echoes still giving me that eerie feeling. I stepped onto the platform and waited for my train. Surprisingly, I was the only one there, still. The tunnels either side were emitting some kind of very distant howl which really gave my the creeps. After trying to tune them out for a solid five minutes, I suddenly realised that the sounds were literally by the end of the tunnel. As I started freaking out slightly, the rattling of a train drowned out the sounds and it came thundering in and screeched to a rough stop in the station. The interior lights were abnormally dim and the carriages were very gloomy. However, with only a couple of second thoughts, I stepped on and the doors glided closed behind me. I went to sit down on the rock hard seats and the train thundered off again. Despite the fact there was nobody in my carriage, I felt slightly more comfortable now. 

The work day was normal and my boss let me. leave almost an hour early to beat the rush hour on the subway as he knew it was my first time and how I despised it. I massively thanked him and quickly headed for the station. I got on the train home back to Bedgebury Street and and there were a few people on the train this time. Well around ten people in my carriage. However, the station just before Bedgebury Street, everyone seemed to get off very suddenly. I thought it was slightly odd but didn’t think too much of it, or tried not to at least. The train pulled into Bedgebury Street and I got off as it whirred as it sat idle in the station. As I reached the ticket office, I realised the whirring hadn’t stopped and got very curious suddenly. I scuppered back down the stairs and onto the platform to see the train still sitting there with all its doors open. I looked up and down the platform but could still see no one. Forgetting life’s number one lesson: curiosity killed the cat, I wanted to have a look to see if anyone was in one of the carriages. I stepped into the nearest one and as I did, the doors began sliding shut behind me. I jumped back through the doors before they shut and suddenly felt as if someone was watching me. It wasn’t an overwhelming feeling but it was definitely there. 

Slightly disturbed, I headed home and had dinner, watched some TV and then headed bed at around 11. However, I woke up at about 2AM after having dreamed about the train ever since I fell asleep. After my stupid idea got the better of me, I jumped out of bed and ran down to the station. I ran down to the ticket office and further down to the platforms. The whirring train was still there, open doors as if trying to entice me in. As I turned around, something shocked me and almost made me scream. A figure. A black overcoat, black suit trousers and a black hat. As quietly as I could, I walked backwards all the way out of the station and then sprinted home. 

The next morning, I felt extremely ill after what I experienced and called in sick to work. I spent eh whole day taking my mind off the night before and went to bed hoping I’d feel better the next morning. I woke up and was completely fine. As much as i didn’t want to take the subway, I had no choice and got ready for work. I got to the station fully expecting the train to still be there, but it wasn’t. Neither was that man. I stood rigidly waiting for the train to arrive. When it finally did, I reluctantly stepped on and the doors shut behind me, as if it knew I was the only passenger. It suffers to start and thundered out of the station. As I went to take my seat, I noticed through the glass of the door leading to the next carriage, there was the head of the figure from the other night. Trying to not to look at it, I sat down for about five seconds before shooting back up again. It was closer. It was only two carriages away now. I backed away to the far end of the carriage, keeping my eyes on it the entire time. It didn’t get any closer. I turned around to open the drop handle to the next carriage and when I looked back it was in the carriage with me. I sprinted through to e next carriage and suddenly we were stopped at the next station and people began boarding, causing the figure to disappear. 

My next day at work was normal again, but this time I had to stay over time to finish a project that needed doing for the following morning. Two hours seemed to drift by in a few minutes and I realised the time and headed for the subway once again. I boarded, holding back a panic attack for if everyone got off again. They did. They all got off just before Bedgebury Street Station. As soon as the train started moving again, I noticed the figure. Same carriage. Not even ten feet away from me. Keeping my eye on it I backed away to the other end of the carriage, but this time I didn’t try and run through the train. As far as I could tell, it couldn’t move if I was looking at it. As we stopped in Bedgebury Street, I backed through, the doors, keeping my eye on it as I walked backwards along the platform. Suddenly, I stumbled and lost sight of it for a split second. I turned back to see if it was still there. Nothing. I sprinted up the stairs, seemingly quicker footsteps following me. They seemed almost right behind. I turned my head slightly and in my periferel vision, could see a black face with no facial features practically breathing down my neck. I ran through the derelict ticket office and up the final set of stairs to the street. I swear I could feel this thing touching me as I finally reached the street. I turned round and it was gone. 

I sprinted the rest of the way home, and as soon as I got in, I jumped straight on my laptop. 

This was what I found:

Bedgebury Street Subway Station, New York City. 
Opened: 1932
Closed: 1967:

‘Bedgebury Street Station was closed and quickly abandoned after the roof over one of the platforms, platform 4, at the far end of the station collapsed, killing a predicted 57 people instantly from falling rubble and a further 14 people from suffocation. The last train to run through this station was in 1971 after it was misdirected. After a four year search and investigation, the train and the passengers were never seen again.’
