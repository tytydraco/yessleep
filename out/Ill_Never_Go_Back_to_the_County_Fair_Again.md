Corndogs and cow shit scented the air as I sauntered into a barn at the annual county fair on a mission of liberation. Bovines stared in dismay huddled uncomfortably in cages too cramped to call humane. Three 4H kids ran in front of me wearing masks depicting the faces of smiling cows. The hypocrisy was lost on my fellow townsfolk. 

I walked out the back entrance of the stable to find myself staring face to face with a monstrous man inhaling the overcooked slab of meat from his Steak on a Stick. That was a rather common sight at the county fair, but for some reason, I couldn’t take my eyes off him as drool dribbled down what may have once been a chin and splattered onto his undersized “I Support My Local Law Enforcement” tank top. Lifeless green eyes stared unblinking into mine and I got the unsettling sense that he was judging me.

I forced myself to avert my gaze and moved on. 

Two county sheriffs stood under a tent laughing loudly. The taller one with the bald head pretended to grab the gun from his holster and pointed his fingers at his shorter, chubbier companion who fell to his knees and stammered, “Please, officer. Don’t shoot me. The dope ain’t mine.” The two pigs cackled into the dimming evening sky. 

The chicken barn was in front of me at that point and I casually strode inside and absorbed my surroundings. Hundreds of cages were stacked on top of one another, each a foot tall and a foot wide, just large enough to squeeze one chicken inside. The cages made a maze for people to walk through and gawk as the tortured hens squawked. I stopped to look at one chicken in particular, her feathers forced out of the tiny spaces between the bars holding her captive. 

I wanted to free her, but I was on another assignment, so I hung my head in shame and stalked out of the chicken coop and into the open.

Cold, dead green eyes met mine upon exiting. Could that be the same man with the Steak on a Stick from earlier? 

It was! But this time it wasn’t overcooked steak he was eating. He was playing Edward Forty-hands with two twenty-piece buckets of fried chicken. A half-eaten wing bone dropped from his mouth and fell to the grass. 

But wait, that couldn’t have been him. The other guy was wearing a tank top, and this dude was sporting a t-shirt with the words “God, Guns, Guts, and Gravy” written on it in some grotesque font. His jaw hung open and a bit of spittle dribbled off his lip. 

It was the same guy all right. 

His gaze stayed on mine, and I could have sworn there was a hint of malice in those beady eyes. It was like he was staring into my soul.

I shook from whatever fever dream the man had kept placing me under and carried on. I had a job to complete after all. But I couldn’t shake the feeling he was following me. Could he have known why I was there?

I was almost to the pig portion in the livestock section of the fairgrounds when I noticed the two sheriffs from before beating the life out of some guy at the skeeball stand. His hands were cuffed behind his back and he was lying on his stomach, a pool of crimson puddling around his head in the dirt. 

“God damn fuckin’ junkie,” the tall cop with the bald head said as he kicked the man in the side.

“It was… just… a joint!” the man on the ground pleaded through exasperated breaths.

“That shit’s illegal, you god damn fucking scumbag!” the short, chubby cop yelled and then proceeded to spit on the man. “All these nice people are here trying to relax and eat some god damn Steak on a Stick, and here you are polluting the air with your god damn fuckin’ drugs!”

For a moment, I considered informing the two cops about the real causes of air pollution, but I harkened the thoughts weighing in my mind of the possible consequences of such a bold action and turned away. 

My real responsibility that night was ahead and the time on my watch told me it was five minutes until the fair closed. I needed to find a place to hide.

The thirty foot tall Fun Slide was in my sights, so I bolted in its direction and dove under the lowest part to lie in the cold grass and wait. I sat in silence for half an hour then peeled myself off the dewy grass and snuck toward the pig barn.

Snorts and snores surrounded me as I sauntered forth into a harrowing hellhole of hopeless hogs. A few of them grunted at me as I passed them by and stared into their piteously pathetic pupils. 

A sudden squeal to my right revealed a little piglet gasping for breath as the weight of her mother crushed her little frame. The mom spasmed and squirmed in a fruitless attempt to roll off her child, but the confines of the crate encapsuling her wouldn’t allow such sovereignties.

I pressed forward knowing I couldn’t possibly save every animal.

Then a familiar snort sniggered in my direction. I turned to my left and saw him.

“Abner!” I shouted, running to his cage. “I’m so sorry this happened. I swear, once I find out who kidnapped you, I’ll—”

Our reunion was interrupted by a piercingly piggish snort, and I glanced around the dimly lit barn. A sizeable silhouette stood in the distance.

It was a man. A large man with deep, uncomfortable wheezes exhaling from his gaping maw. 

“Stay back. I’ve got a knife and I’m not afraid to use it,” I lied desperately.

He maundered at me. One gargantuan foot hit the ground and his body swayed to the left. The other foot found the floor and his weight sent him the opposite way, hilarious as it was horrifying. 

His massive menacing frame moved into the moonlight shining through a window in the barn. I squinted to make sure it was real. It couldn’t be… it was! That same fucking man from earlier! Only this time he’d had on yet another shirt. A massive sweater hugging his torso just a bit too tightly read “I Love Pigs”, except the word ‘love’ was replaced with a slice of bacon. 

And he wasn’t eating two buckets of fried chicken. He was deep throating a footlong corndog. 

After swallowing the entire thing in one fell swoop, he spit out what was left of the stick onto the hay-covered barn floor and leaned to his left letting out a fart that sounded as if it may have required a change of draws. 

“Fuck are you doin’ in here?” his voice boomed as a light drizzle began to fall outside the barn behind him. 

My mind raced as I struggled to find the right words to say to save myself and Abner from the flesh devouring devil.

“This is private property,” the man said, his eyes penetrating mine as he licked what looked to be mustard off his stubby fingers one at a time. 

“Please,” I said. “Someone stole my pet. I’m just here to free my friend.”

“Pigs ain’t pets,” the man laughed as he removed his pinky from his mouth and placed it in his nose. “Pigs is for eatin’.”

“That’s just a human construct, and a barbaric one at that!” I said as a cold sweat crept down my spine and Abner whimpered beside me. “We don’t have to eat pigs, or any animal for that matter!”

“He sure does look tasty,” the man said as slobber slipped down his chin and he began lumbering in my direction. “Besides, humans need meat. How else we supposed to get our protein?”

“Are you kidding me? There’s protein in so many things! Oats, nuts, beans!” I shouted as I attempted to open the gate holding Abner in his cage. But the door wouldn’t budge. 

“Have you never eaten a god damn bean?” I screamed.

“Maybe I’ll eat you after I’m done with that pig.” The mammoth of a man chuckled as he barreled closer. “You ain’t much bigger than a bean yourself.” 

“Please! Just leave us alone!” I cried.

Then suddenly “What in the god damn fuck is all this god damn fuckin’ noise goin’ on in here?” a familiar voice echoed into the barn.

“More god damn fuckin’ junkies is my guess.” 

Two sheriffs treaded toward us with two shiny Glock nines glistening in their grips. 

“Officers,” the meat-eating menace began, as he spun around to face them. “This boy is an intruder! He’s trying to steal all the bac…”

Five or six gunshots rang throughout the barn before he could finish, and my artery-clogged assailant fell back onto Abner’s wooden cage splitting the structure in two. Abner squealed under his weight, then squeezed himself free, and we slunk to the back entrance unnoticed amid the erupting and chaotic snorts and screeches of the pigs around us.

We snuck out into the night and crept along the outside of the barn. I put my head to the wall and peered into a window.

“Would you look at that,” the tall sheriff laughed and kicked the lifeless body in front of him. “His shirt says I Love Bacon.”

“Fuck, bacon sounds good right now,” the short chubby one said, putting his hands on his stomach. “Let’s go the Waffle House and get some.”

“What do we do about this guy?”

“Let’s just wait till’ the morning. Then when the town breaks out in mass hysteria over a dead body…”        

“We’ll just blame it on another god damn junkie?”

“You bet your god damn ass we do. Now let’s get outta here. I hate god damn fuckin’ pigs.”
