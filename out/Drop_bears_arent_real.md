You ever heard of drop bears? Of course you have. It’s probably one of the first things that springs to mind when somebody mentions Australia. Dark, hidden creatures that drop from the branches of trees and rip ya to shreds. Tourists are warned to stay away from the outback, and especially to avoid resting underneath hanging branches.

I have seen something outside my living room window recently which compels me to advise you the same. Let me take you back to the beginning and explain why…

I grew up in a remote country town in Australia. My tiny little nothing-town was home to around 500 people back then, and housed little more than a school, a post office, a pub and a little shack that sold some essential items like milk and bread and what have you.

It was a quiet life, and that was both a blessing and a curse. Would I have preferred to have a normal childhood that looked more like movie theatres, arcades and shopping malls? Yeah, probably. But there’s a whole lot of cool stuff I got to do that just wouldn’t have been possible had I grown up in a more urban setting. Weekends spent camping, hiking, bush walking. These are things you just don’t get to do when you grow up in the cities, or if you do, it’s rare.

For me? An impromptu camping trip was as easy as packing my things and walking out the door. And this, incidentally, brings us to the beginning of my tale, as that is exactly what we planned to do that fateful day. It was just a couple of weeks after my 18th birthday, and I was sitting in the back row in science class, counting down the seconds to 3pm. It was a Friday afternoon, and I had the weekend all planned out.

*“Hey! Did ya tell your Dad we’re going to Eric’s for the weekend? I do not want my parents getting a call from anyone!”* My girlfriend, Emily, whispered to me from the row behind me.

Yeah, we had come up with the “brilliant” plan to tell our parents that we were going to stay at our friend Eric’s place for the weekend, when really, we planned to hit the bush for a three day camp out. To be fair, it was pretty much foolproof. And had things not gone the way they did, we probably would have gotten away with it. Eric’s house was kind of on the outskirts of town. I mean, if the town was rural, his house was in Woop Woop. At least an hour or so driving down a secluded dirt road. As far as our parents knew, that’s where we were gonna be. With plenty of other kids around. In separate beds. Certainly not sharing a swag together under a starlit sky. There was no mobile reception out there, so there was no way for anyone to check up on us.

*“Don’t worry, it’s all taken care of! Eric’s parents are away at the stock trade too, so no one’s gonna be calling anyone,”* I said.

Emily gave me a cheeky little grin before turning back to her books. We had been dating for around a few months or so, and so far things were going really well. I was pretty sure about this girl. Well, as sure as you can be at that age.

Startling me out of my thoughts, I felt a firm punch land on my right arm.

*“Dude!”* Said Eric from beside me. *“I got us a bottle of Bundy for the trip! This weekend’s gonna be off the charts!”* He said, laughing.

Eric was to be joining us on this excursion. I felt kinda bad. Both for making him a third wheel, and for bringing along a third wheel. I’m sure Emily and I both would have preferred a little privacy, but we needed Eric. He had recently gotten his provisional licence. Emily and I were both old enough to have gotten ours, but living in such a tiny little town with everything in walking distance, there wasn’t a huge motivation to do so. Especially when you had mates who could drive ya. So, Eric would be our driver this weekend, as he so often was. The spot we were headed was about an hour’s drive down a little known turnoff. You had to bush bash a little just to find this road, then it was another long and rough drive from there.

***Rrrrriiiinnnggggggg!!!***

Finally! The school bell rang out through the halls, and we were free! I chucked my books into my bag and, along with Eric and Emily, made my way out of the building. We all rendezvoused at the south gate.

*“So, pick you guys up at 4, yeah?”* Eric asked.

*“Yeah, sounds good dude! You got all the supplies and that yeah?”* I asked him.

We couldn’t be seen loading camping equipment into his car in front of our parents. Luckily, Eric had everything we would need at his house. Like I said, they lived far out of town on a cattle station, so they camped often while they were out mustering and what not.

*“Everything’s in the car ready to go. Swags, billy, grill, all of it. And that… ya know? What I said to ya before aye?”* Eric said, making a drinking motion, laughing heartily as he did so.

Eric had an infectious laugh, along with the absolute goofiest grin you’ve ever seen in your life. We couldn’t help but join in with his entirely unnecessary guffawing.

*“Alright alright, let’s not scare the lady off before this trip even gets started,”* I said, putting my arm around Emily.

*“What ya talkin about?”* She said, *“I could drink you boys under the table!”*

*“Woah!”* Eric shouted, erupting into another fit of laughter, *“this one might put* ***you*** *to shame mate!”*

*“Yeah yeah get on outta here dickhead we’ll see ya at 4”* I said, taking Emily’s hand in mine and heading off down the road towards out street.

Emily and I walked quietly along down the road heading back into town. I could tell that show of hers back there was a little put on. She was fairly new in town, having grown up in the city, she made the move out here with her parents around a year ago. Being new, she would often say and do things she thought was, I guess, expected around these parts. I would do my best to reassure her, let her know that I liked her for who she was, and of course I never pushed her to be anything but herself, or do anything she didn’t want to do. It had taken me quite a while to agree to this trip, for that very reason. I wanted to be sure this wasn’t something she was just doing to impress me. But no, she was genuinely excited for this.

We reached our street, and I gave Emily a kiss and told her we’d meet up at my place around 4pm. She smiled sweetly at me as she made her way inside, her Mum and Dad giving me a wave from where they sat on the porch. They were always so nice to me, and I felt a little gross lying to them that day. But, while the law may have considered me a mature adult, I was still a stupid teenager, and the thought of a secluded weekend with my girlfriend was just too powerful a temptation. There was no way my conscience was winning that one.

Suppressing my moral compass, I made my way up the block and across the road to my place. Dad was home, along with Eddy, his mate from the mines. Eddy was a good bloke. He was an Indigenous man, worked at the same place my Dad did, and he would often stay with us to save money on accommodation. It was no burden to us, in fact we appreciated the company since it was just me and Dad. We were more than happy to give up one of the spare rooms when he was in town. In fact he was here so often that room was practically known as “Eddy’s room”.

*“Headin out to Eric’s mate aye?”* Asked Eddy. 

“Yeah! Just for a couple nights,” I responded.

*“You be careful out in the scrub mate!”* He said, only half jokingly. *“Keep an eye out for Quinkans!”*

*“Yeah mate! No joke those Quinkans. Better keep ya eyes open!”* Said my Dad. Who simply couldn’t help but join in on these little ribbing sessions.

I kinda half laughed, rolling my eyes and heading into my room to pack some things. Eddy was very in touch with his Indigenous roots. A “Quinkan”, for the record, is what his people believe are spirits of the bush. They were just one of the many ghosts and monsters he would talk about often. Those sorts of stories, they’re not exactly well known. You type it into Google you’re gonna get snippets of information spread few and far between. But Eddy? He knew it all. If it’s supposedly wandered this land at any point in history, he could tell you all about it.

Personally, I preferred not to hear about such things when I was about to spend a weekend out there where these things supposedly lurked. I hurriedly threw some clothes into a bag, along with a few other necessities. Kicking back on my bed, I opened my bedside drawer, pulling out my trendy new Nokia 3315 and texting Emily that I was ready whenever she was. Just a few minutes later I heard the door swing open, followed by Eddy’s booming voice.

*“Good ta’ see ya again young Miss!”* He excitedly shouted from where he sat. 

Emily, still quite shy around him and my Dad, politely returned the greeting, not quite knowing what to say next. I chivalrously made my way out to rescue her, pack over my shoulder ready to go.

*“Righto righto, we’re off!”* I said. Taking Emily’s hand, we began to walk back outside.

Eddy, beer in hand and cigarette in mouth, spoke up once again. *“True God though lad, you keep an eye out for this young Miss. You grown up here, you know the land fair well by now aye, but you watch out for her ya hear me?”* Eddy said, something of a serious tone in his voice now.

I told him not to worry, that she’s in good hands. *“We’re just going to Eric’s house anyways, not like we’re gonna be bush bashing,”* I said.

He looked at me then like he knew full well that was a lie.

*“You listen to Eddy, son. He knows his stuff,”* said my Dad. And I nodded in solemn agreement, sensing they at least had their inklings that our plans were not what we were letting on.

We said our goodbyes, falsely assuring them all was fine, and stepped outside to wait for Eric. As we were waiting, I noticed Emily getting a little quiet, and I asked her if everything was okay.

*“What did your Uncle mean?”* She asked me. *“There’s nothing, like, dangerous out there?”.*

*“That’s not my Uncle”,* I said, laughing. *“That’s just Eddy. And don’t mind him, he’s always on about spooky shit.”*

Emily relaxed a little after hearing this, but I could tell she was still keeping her guard up. This would be her first time out in the bush. I was certainly not apathetic to this, I remembered my first time out and how scary it was. I assured her it was gonna be fun and that we would certainly not see anything scary.

A few moments later, along came Eric in his Ford Falcon station wagon. It was a beat up old hunk of junk given to him by his parents after they’d gotten a new one a few years ago. But honestly? That made it perfect for our adventures. There’s nothing better for navigating the bush than something you can beat around a bit. He pulled up out front, staring out the window with that excessively goofy grin of his.

*“Oi! Let’s get goin aye?! Good couple hours drive out there!”* He shouted.

Emily and I slid into the back seat, neither of us wanting to take the front seat and leave the other sitting alone.

*“Jesus what am I ya chauffeur?! Who’s gonna sit next to wittle ol’ me?!”* Said Eric, sarcastically.

*“Hey not our fault you’ve scared away every girl within cooee… probably every bloke too!”* I quickly retorted, getting a good laugh out of Emily.

The first hour of driving went by pretty quickly. We were all in high spirits, and Emily and I had made a start on that bottle of Bundy, making for some fun back and forth banter. As time dragged on though the typical boredom that comes from sitting in a car for any extended length of time began to set in. We were just quietly looking out the window as the beauty of the outback rolled on by. We were getting pretty deep in by this stage, anything resembling civilisation had long since disappeared. It was about a quarter past 5 when we finally rounded the bend leading up to the turnoff. It was time to head off road.

Emily cringed a little as Eric swung off the dirt road and the spindly dead grass screeched along the bottom of our vehicle. I could tell this was totally uncharted territory for her, as she gripped my hand a little tighter. Eric swerved quickly as a huge “Big Red” kangaroo suddenly hopped out along our path before disappearing into the scrub. Those are the big bastards you gotta be real careful of out there. Not just on the roads, but if you’re out here bush walking and you run into one? You wanna hope you startle him enough to scare him away, cause it’s pretty much gonna be a death sentence otherwise. They’ve been known to slice people clean open with those powerful legs and sharp claws. Seriously, kangaroos are not to be messed with.

After a few more minutes of driving, we finally found the turnoff and we were on our way. The road from that point on was much more secluded, surrounded by thick bushland. Huge ghost gums and paperbark trees, some as tall as houses, defined the land out there. Their limbs hung heavy over the road, almost creating a tunnel like effect as we drove on down. I noticed Emily looking out the window at those trees with a concerned look on her face, and I gave her hand a little squeeze, letting her know everything was okay.

*“We’ve been here a few times babe. There’s nothing to be afraid of,”* I said to her with a smile, which she reciprocated.

*“Well, if you don’t count the drop bears!”* Eric teasingly said.

*“The what?”* Asked Emily. Growing up in the city, she had not been privy to such local legends, even the more common ones.

*“Absolutely nothing. Drop bears aren’t real. They’re just a stupid urban legend”* I said, with a tone in my voice that Eric seemed to miss entirely, as he continued his teasing.

*“Yeah! Think like, koalas, but bigger. And with reeaalllyy sharp teeth! They hide in the branches of trees like these ones. Then, when ya right underneath ‘em, they drop down on top of ya and they rip ya throat out!”* He made a weird growling sound, and Emily squirmed in her seat as he did so.

*“Is this what Eddy was talking about?”* Asked Emily, a hint of concern in her voice now.

*“Nah babe,”* I said. *“He believe a whole lotta weird shit. But I ain’t ever heard him mention drop bears.”*

*“Well, they’re out there!”* said Eric. *“Seen ‘em with my own eyes! Once when we were out mustering, and another time on a camp draft! Saw em’ drag some poor sucker right off the trail. Never saw him again!”*

*“Oh my God stop it!”* Emily spoke up, clearly a little distressed now.

*“Dude come on, ease up hey?”* I said to Eric. I knew there had been no malice in what he was doing. He was just one of those guys who tended to not know where the line was sometimes.

It was somewhat of an awkward drive for the final half hour. We all sat in silence, not really knowing what to say to each other. But soon enough we neared the final bend and we caught sight of our little pocket of paradise. It was a gorgeous spot out there. Picture a yellow sand riverbank, clear blue flowing water with plenty of fish, and a little alcove surrounded by those beautiful ghost gums and paperbarks. Their branches stretched out at just the right angles to provide shade at all hours of the day.

Eric cruised on down, coming to stop near to a relatively flat patch of land.

*“Should be good spot to set the swags up aye?”* Asked Eric, and I answered in the affirmative. Emily had clearly forgotten about the drop bear comments earlier, and she looked proper excited now! It was clear this really was her first time out there. We all jumped out and started unpacking our things.

*“Where’s our tent?”* asked Emily. Eric and I looked at each other and chuckled. I said nothing, instead just reaching into the dog box and pulling out a rolled up swag.

*“This is our tent,”* I said, looking at her with a smirk on my face.

If you’re as unfamiliar as Emily was to the concept of an Aussie swag, it’s basically a mattress with a really, really small cover attached. I guess you could call it a small tent, at a stretch, but the cover is honestly just big enough to maybe fit a very small pack in there with you.

I laid the swag out, unrolling it and popping up the cover. As I got to work hammering in tent pegs, Emily swaggered on over, walking around the swag and inspecting it. She crossed her arms and looked down at me.

*“Hmmm… That’s very… Cozy…”* She said, looking at me with an accusing look on her face.

I just smiled back at her, not even bothering to deny anything.

It was nearing around 6:30 by this stage, so as soon as we had everything set up, we got some dinner going and began to settle in for the night. Dinner was to be a luxurious dining experience consisting of Heinz baked beans, Tom Piper canned sausages and to top it all off, tinned sauerkraut. Honestly though, it’s amazing how tasty terrible food becomes when you’re out there roughing it.

After dinner, we all sat around the fire toasting marshmallows for dessert. Emily’s eyes went wide as she lowered the marshmallow on the end of her stick into the flames and it caught on fire, and Eric and I both laughed as she squealed, frantically blowing it out.

*“What’d you think was gonna happen?”* I asked through tears of laughter.

*“I don’t know! I thought it would just like heat up a little bit!”* She shot back, laughing along with us, but clearly a little embarrassed.

And so the night went on. Tears were shed, stories were told, and laughter was shared. Sitting there under the starry moonlit sky, knowing we were just existing there together in one of the most isolated places on the face of the earth, was absolutely beautiful.

Eventually, we all started getting a little tired, and our spirits began to mellow. As we sat there around the fire, passing the bottle of Bundy to one another, Eric started getting very quiet.

*“What’s wrong with you?”* I asked, kinda jokingly.

*“This is, like, maybe one of the last times we’ll ever be doing this.”* He answered, a little sadness in his voice.

*“Jesus dude, no one’s dying!”* I said back, trying to lighten the mood back up.

*“Nah man… I mean, this is like our senior year, you know? It feels like everything’s coming to an end. How many times we’ve done this, you and me aye? It’s always been so much fun, because we knew there was always a next time. I dunno… just feels like we’re running out of next times.”* Eric trailed off softly.

I must admit, that did hit me a little hearing him say that. It was such a bittersweet metaphor to life. How many of those next times do we really have? How would we do things differently if we knew?

*“We’ll probably never see eachother again you know?”* Eric wasn’t done yet. *“Mum and Dad’ll make me partner on the station. And you… Well. You got a serious girlfriend now. You guys will probably go off and do your own thing. There won’t be time to visit each other. Just feels like everything’s moving so fast now.”*

I saw Emily’s head turn toward me out the corner of my eye, and I turned to face her. She was smiling at me.

*“Serious girlfriend?”* She asked.

I clammed up a little, unsure of what to say.

*“Oh come on…”* Said Eric, looking at me from across the fire. *“I’ve known you for years. I’ve never seen you like this with anyone. I’ll bet ya my life you two are still together in 10 years time.”*

Emily shifted over a little closer to me, and I put my arm around her. I gently kissed her and pulled her close to me.

*“You know what dude?”* I said, smiling at Emily as the fire crackled away in the night. *“I think there’s plenty more next times ahead of us.”*

Eric rolled his eyes, before getting up and letting out an exaggerated yawn.

*“I’m goin’ to bed! Before you lovebirds make me puke!”* He said, heading over to his swag.

*“Yeah… that’s totally us, right? Not at all cause ya can’t hold ya Bundy!”* I shot back at him, giving him a teasing little wink.

*“Ha! Whatever dude! Alright, see yas in the morning! Watch out for those drop bears Em!”* Eric said, sporting that stupidly eccentric grin, before crawling into his swag and zipping it up.

*“Drop Bears aren’t real dickhead!”* I shouted back at him, more for Emily’s sake than my own.

Emily and I sat by the fire a little longer, just enjoying the ambience. We talked back and forth a while, reflecting on the earlier conversation. She continued to subtly quiz me on Eric’s “serious girlfriend” remark, of course, and I deflected as best I could, as any typical young man tends to do. Deep down though I think we both knew what Eric had said was true.

The hours ticked on by and eventually we decided it was time to get some sleep. I flicked on my little battery powered lantern, grabbed a bucket of water from the river and doused the fire, the flames sizzling out with a resounding hiss. We both made our way over to our shelter for the night. I unzipped the entrance, hung our little light source up on the roof of the swag and we climbed on in. We got all snuggled up and comfy, and before long, as the wind quietly whistled through the ghost gums outside, and the cicadas sung their sweet lullabies, we were off to sleep in eachother’s arms.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I awoke with a start to the sound of the swag being unzipped. I spun around quickly to find… Emily.

*“Shhh… relax! I was just takin’ a piss,”* she whispered. Yeah she was starting to talk like a proper country girl by this stage.

*“Bloody scared me! Not exactly the kinda sound ya wanna wake up to out here,”* I said, laughing a little.

*“Sorry!”* She said, also snickering a little. *“Oh my God it’s so nice out here!”*

*“Yeah, sure is.”* I said, as she snuggled back up in my arms. *“We could do this more often ya know?”*

*“That’d be nice.”* She said, smiling. *“I’d love to see more of the bush out here. I must admit though, I find the stories a little… disturbing.”*

I laughed. *“What? Like the drop bears? You know that stuff’s not real right?”*

*“I know!”* She said. *“But, Eddy sure seems to think there’s something to it…”*

*“Eddy believes a lot of quirky stuff.”* I reassured her. *“Hang around him enough he’ll have you believing all sorts of scary stories. Then you’ll never wanna come back out here!”*

She laughed softly. *“Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, I think it would be…”*

Emily stopped mid sentence. The sound of rustling leaves above us giving her pause.

*“Babe seriously don’t sweat it. Nothing’s out here. It’s just the wind.”*

*“Okay…” She trailed off. “But I swear I could…”*

She was cut off again. This time by my own hand clasping firmly over her mouth, and pulling her tightly up close to me.

That time, I had heard something that actually did cause me alarm.

There is a big difference out there between the typical sounds of the bush that may startle those who aren’t used to them, and sounds that really should be paid attention to. After many, many trips out there, from hiking with Dad as a kid to camping with friends in my teen years, I had learned to tell the difference.

What I heard in that moment was not a few leaves rustling in the wind. It was the sound of feet scratching along the branches above us. Paws, or maybe something clawed. It was moving slowly but surely around up there.

Emily began shaking, and I knew she had caught on to the seriousness of the situation.

*“Shhh,”* I said. *“Try not to move.”*

You must understand, I had seen all manner of bush animals. I had pretty much seen it all. Dingoes, wild pigs, roos, crocs, if it lives out here I’ve encountered it in one way or another. I had never in my life, however, heard of or seen an animal that walks along the thick branches of a paperbark tree with such weight upon it that it causes the branch to begin physically creaking.

That is what we heard as we lay there in that little swag. The sounds of the branches above us creaking, straining under the weight of something taking very deliberate steps.

*“You told me drop bears weren’t real.”* Emily whispered through tears.

*“Shhh.”* I said again. *“They’re not… I mean… They can’t be…”* I stammered in response, trying to keep as quiet as possible.

And then we heard another sound. A zipper from the swag on the other side of the camp. I felt Emily jolt suddenly, as she instinctually tried to get up to warn Eric. I tightened my firm grip on her, and pressed my hand harder against her mouth. There was nothing we could do. If there was something out there capable of hurting Eric, how did it make sense to put us in danger too? We had no choice! Right?! Emily was shaking uncontrollably now, and honestly? So was I.

We heard more footsteps from above making their way out along one of the branches. We could hear fingers, or toes, or whatever it possessed, softly patting down upon the paperbark as it crept its way along.

We heard Eric crawl his way out of his swag.

We heard him stand up and yawn.

We heard the sound of something slip off the paperbark above.

We heard what would be Eric’s last words. “What the fu…”

We heard those words trail into a scream for but a mere moment.

And then we heard something land with a ***thud.***

My grip once again tightened around Emily, as she descended into full blown panic mode. She desperately tried to struggle, her fight or flight instinct no doubt kicking in. We could hear muffled groans and the sound of a person kicking and struggling in the dirt outside. I shut my eyes and carefully pulled a blanket over Emily and I as I heard the sound of something slurping and gurgling. Sounds I have never, ever heard out here before.

After many long minutes on end listening to those noises, all went quiet.

We lay there for ages as time ticked by into the early hours of the morning, at any moment expecting to see something appear before the entrance to our swag. But nothing came. 

After many long hours lying there, I chanced a look outside. I slowly, carefully unzipped the swag and poked my head out.

Right there, concealed in the shadows of the night, I could see the outline of somebody sitting in front of Eric's swag. They appeared to be sitting cross legged, kind of hunched over and swaying back and forth. Still apprehensive, yet concerned that my friend may need help, I slowly crawled my way over toward Eric's swag.

I kept my eyes locked on the figure ahead of me in the darkness. I could hear noises now, almost like the whimpering of a dog. Little squeaks and chuckles.

"Eric!" I said under my breath. But no reply came.

I shuffled closer again, almost within reach of the figure now. I could see a little clearer now. The figure was shirtless, but I still could not make out clearly who it was.

Still cringing in fear I closed the remaining distance between us and sat back in the rough dirt.

"Eric?" I asked, my voice shaking. No response, just more whimpering.

Slowly. Ever so slowly, I reached a hand out, placing it on the figure's shoulder.

No sooner did I realise that this was absolutely NOT Eric, when in a flash this thing spun around. I had barely enough time to register the clearly inhuman form of this thing before I felt something sharp grabbing my arm and digging into my skin.

Convinced my life was about to end bloody I hurled myself backward, sharp claws squelching their way out of my exposed flesh as I did so. I tucked myself into a ball, bracing for the oncoming attack. But it never came. I looked back up to see this thing still sitting there, rocking back and forth, once again whimpering.

For whatever reason, it could not move. Or, it didn't want to? I have no idea. But it was not budging. I slowly inched myself away with my one remaining good arm. Dark was the night, I could not quite make out what my attacker was, but I sure as hell had felt it, and had zero intentions of sticking around any longer.

I crawled my way back to our swag, all the while keeping my eyes locked on the unseen thing ahead of me. Still it sat there, rocking back and forth, the noises it was emitting growing more and more aggressive. WHat had been whimpers had now morphed into guttural growls.

I dragged my way back into the swag, pressing a finger against Em's lips as her hands found the state of my arm in the darkness.

*“Please don’t scream.”* I whispered to her. *“Something’s out there.”*

We could do nothing but lay there all throughout the night.

As the sun crept its way across the sky early in the morning, still we heard little movement in the camp, save for the gentle rocking motions and the inhuman sounds emanating through the camp. We lay there for hours and hours into the next day, Emily occasionally breaking into silent sobs, her tears trickling down across my arm. The sun was burning high in the sky by this stage. It was nearing on summer and we were getting dangerously close to heat stroke underneath that blanket.

It wasn’t until maybe 3 in the arvo that we finally heard movement.

***Drag… Flop…***

***Drag… Flop…***

***Drag… Flop…***

Something big was dragging itself away.

***Drag… Flop…***

***Drag… Flop…***

***Drag… Flop…***

We then heard the sound of something splash into the nearby river, and the soft sounds of water swishing and swirling, as though something was awkwardly swimming across. The river was not all that wide, yet it seemed to take forever for these splashing sounds to cease, before we finally heard that dragging flopping noise continue across the barren earth on the other side.

And it was then we heard an awful sound. One that I will never be capable of erasing from my memory, no matter how hard I have tried over the years. In the silence of the outback, we heard disgusting burping, regurgitating sounds echoing out over the land. For minutes on end this went on, as if something were trying to forcibly belch out its own intestines. Still to this day I feel sick as I vividly recall these sounds in my head.

And that was that. This excruciatingly prolonged vomiting came to an abrupt halt, followed by the sounds of footfalls rapidly disappearing off into the distance. And that would be the last we ever heard of that particular nightmare…

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It felt like forever we lay there in the swag. We were both too afraid to come out. Terrified that something might be sitting there waiting for us. It was well into the evening, maybe 6pm or so, when we heard the crunch of tires, followed by an engine shutting off, and car doors opening and closing. Footsteps, two pairs of them, made their way around the campsite before coming to stop in front of our swag. We looked up to see Dad, and we both scrambled out of the swag, frantically yelling and screaming about monsters and telling him we need to get the hell out of there.

*“Where’s young Eric?!”* I heard Eddy’s voice from the other side of the camp, standing by our friend’s now empty swag.

We just looked at him, tears in our eyes, Emily screaming about drop bears. Eddy just looked off into the trees, shaking his head.

Eric’s parents had come home early, you see. Finding no trace of him at home, calls were made, and when Dad and Eddy discovered we were not in fact staying at Eric’s place all weekend, they narrowed it down, knowing we’d come to one of our favourite camping spots. We all made our way back home in silence.

There were Police enquiries. And of course, Eric’s disappearance was treated with the highest suspicion. But we were just stupid kids. Dad had money, and we had the best legal representation said money could buy. Eddy stopped coming around. I suppose Dad didn’t want him putting ideas in my head, or perpetuating thoughts that were already there. Our babblings of monsters and cryptids went no further than the lawyers who swiftly told us to shut the hell up about it unless we wanted to see the inside of an institution.

And so we did. Until many years later, that is.

See, my story doesn’t end there, all those years ago. Eric had been right about one thing, Emily and I were meant to be. All these years later we share a home and a life together, settling down in our own house on our own little patch of land a little ways drive out of town. We never felt right about the idea of leaving. So we didn’t. I followed my Dad into the mines, and Emily got a job teaching. Survivor’s guilt is a strange phenomenon. Something about what Eric said to us that night, the last time we ever spoke to him. His speech about how he’s gonna be stuck here while Emily and I move on and live our lives. Those words burrowed their way into our subconscious. We never could bring ourselves to move out of that shit hole of a town. Why should we get to move on when Eric never will?

I never could have guessed how true those words would be.

You see, after many years of suppressing those memories at the advice of our legal team, and of course our parents, who didn’t want the embarrassment of supposedly mentally unstable children, it is only recently these memories began to truly resurface, and I made a call to an old friend.

Eddy and I met up at the pub in town one Friday evening, and as we got to talking, I gently eased into the subject of monsters and legends.

*“Mate… this is gonna sound bizarre, even for you… but is there any truth to the drop bears thing? Is that something that’s talked about among your people?”* I asked him, before taking a sip of my beer.

Eddy just laughed. *“Nah brother. No such thing. That’s a white fella story that one.”*

I took another swig of my beer, wondering whether I really wanted to go down this path of conversation.

*“That night…”* I started.

*“Yeah I know what happened that night mate.”* Eddy interrupted me.

I turned and looked at him, the look in my eyes clearly asking him to continue.

*“Ain’t no such thing as a drop bear. But all legends stem from somewhere ya know.”* He said. *“Few critters my people know of that live in the trees like that. Most harmless. One of ‘em far from it.”*

I spoke up at this point. *“We heard something drop down from the tree that night. I could never forget it Eddy, they all told me to shut up and not talk about it. But I could never forget those sounds.”*

*“I know brother, I know. And you got a right to know what happened to your mate out there. Only one thing I know of that’ll do that. We call it the Yara-ma-yha-who. Name sounds a bit silly but don’t let that fool ya. This fella’s no fun at all. But I’m sure ya know that.”* Said Eddy, with a serious tone in his voice now.

*“I’ve never heard of it…”* I answered.

*“Not many have mate.”* Eddy continued. *“It’s like the vampire of our land I guess would be the closest white fella comparison. But totally different look. He’s a chubby little one. Thick. Sometimes hairy. He’ll drop down from the tree and before ya can get so much as a scream out he’s already got ya in his mouth.”*

I thought back to that night. That thud we heard, as something dropped from above.

*“You sure you wanna hear the rest mate?”* Asked Eddy, clearly sensing some discomfort.

*“Yeah… go on…”* I said. It wasn’t out of any need to hear anymore. I suppose it was just morbid curiosity by that stage.

*“He ah… well, he slowly start to eat ya then. Little chomps at a time ya know? He ain’t got sharp teeth or nothin’… it’s a bit like a snake I suppose when he’s chowin’ down on his prey. He’ll just sit there and slowly eat ya up. Don’t matter how ya struggle. Once he got ya, no gettin’ away.”*

I thought back to those groans, slurps, and gurgles as Eric struggled helplessly around…

*“After he gobble ya up this fella, he’s just gonna sit there and digest ya for a while. After that? He’ll find a nice shady spot to belch ya up. Then ya just kinda sit there for a few days in a state of limbo. You’re just a mess of guts and innards by then. But you’ll be concious through it all. Slowly, ya start to reform. After that, you come back to life. Not as ya were though, nah brother, now you’re one of his kind. You’ll wander the land forever as one of ‘em.”*

I thought back to those awful vomiting noises we heard.

The conversation trickled on along similar lines from there. It was a lot to take in, and I admit I was still sceptical, despite what I knew full well I had heard that night. I guess it was just too awful a fate for me to comprehend. The idea that not only was Eric’s death not quick and not at all painless, but the thought of the Yara-ma-yha-who’s victims never knowing peace. It was too much to take in. Too much to carry. My mind refused to accept it.

We finished our beers, said our goodbyes, and I made my way back home. Which brings us to now.

You may be wondering what prompted me to get in touch with Eddy after all these years. Well, it is because I believe I have seen the very thing he described to me that night. One look at it, and I knew there was only one man to talk to.

It was a quiet night just a couple of weeks ago. Emily and I were sitting in our living room having dinner, when all of a sudden we heard a strange sound, one we had not heard in almost 20 years, rustling its way up one of the branches just outside our second storey window.

Something was perched on the branch, hunched over, and staring inside at us. It was short, thick, and chubby.

It was grinning the absolute goofiest grin you’ve ever seen in your life.
