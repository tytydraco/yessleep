This is a post that i have posted on other subreddits, i don't know what to do, and just need people's help and input.

My boyfriend and I live in a big city, and although its probably the safest city in the U.S we are aware that there is still crime. We were out late grabbing some late night burgers. We take the subway home due to not having a car in the city, mostly because of high parking prices, but like it I said it was pretty late. I would say around 1 am.

We rarely go out late, but we were just craving a crappy greasy cheeseburger, but anywho, i would say that our city has a low rate of the homeless and drugies, they normally hide who knows where during the day, and come out at night.

 We were waiting for the train which was delayed by 15 minutes, we were the only ones at the station at that moment, then two men walk in. One stayed back and waited by the entrance, while the other man approaches us. I would say he is about 5'10 maybe around 180 pounds or so, in a grey hoodie and sweatpants, but he came over and immedietly asked us for money. 

My boyfriend tells him sure thing, and asks if he has a square or any credit card machine on him because we arent carrying cash nor is anyone in a big tech city like we are in now. We walked away, and went further down into the subway tunnel to get away from the men, but the one guy kept following us and even gripped my arm and pulled me back and yelled at me to give him some money. My boyfriend just calmly walked up took his hand off of me with ease and gently asked him to just go away.

My boyfriend does not look like much to be honest lol, he is very relaxed and slouches a lot which make him look to be around 5'10 and he is about 220 pounds. But seeing him step in front of me to protect me and face this man, he was not slouching and he stood up straight which made him well over 6 feet, i have never seen him carry himself that way, he looked very intimidating while still having a gentle smile on his face. 

I was expecting for the thug to just walk away especially after my boyfriend took two step forward and was face to face with the guy but literally looking down on the thug due to the height difference. Im guessing the man didn't like that because he shoved my boyfriend with force making him take two steps back. He started making fun of my boyfriend because he was shaking, he taunted my boyfriend because he saw his body shake and asked ''are you scared or something boy, your body won't stop shaking who are you trying to fool .'' 

My boyfriend smiled and said '' why would I be scared of you, I haven't felt fear since I was three when I saw half my village and family get massacred, all i feel for you is pity, I'm shaking because im excited. This is all adrenaline, its been such a long time since I let loose. You have no idea how hard it is to contain and control this darkness inside of me. I'll show you my gratitude by not holding back.'' at this moment you could tell the guy was freaking out, even i was taken aback and took several steps away. However the guy didn't back down and tried to call out a bluff, my boyfriend asked him to look into his eyes, '' what do you see, do you still think Im bluffing'' my boyfriend said in a cold tone. '' i see darkness, there is n-nothing there, there is no life no emotion, why is there nothing but darkness.'' the man said. ''WHY CAN'T I MOVE? PLEASE, IM SORRY, PLEASE LET ME GO.'' the man screamed. I was confused on what he was talking about, then I felt it, my legs started feeling weak and started shaking, I had goosebump everywhere, and everything in my body screamed for me to run, but i could't move, I was paralyzed in fear.

After a couple seconds of fumbling around the man got up and bolted for the exit Where there wasnt anyone at the entrance anymore. The other guy must have seen what happened and got spooked. ''What was that'' I asked him, ''what do you mean'' he asked, '' that feeling I just felt, probably felt the same thing he did. I couldn't move even though my brain yelled at me to run''. '' Oh that'' he said laughing. '' That was the human body telling you that you are about to die, and your only way out is to run, but average people freeze in those situations, more experienced people that I've encountered that run at me normally end up on their butt because their body acts on their own and retracts/flinches at the last second, which keeps them away from me''.

We went home, and he acted as if nothing happened, he was talkative and cheerful, I just don't know what to do. I can't sleep because of this. I know he had a hard life, like his family being massacred, him living in the streets on NYC alone at the age of 5, being in a coma for over 9 months, his ex fiancee dying in his arms 8 years ago, etc.

 I would imagine a person that went through all of that would be broken, and not cheerful, kind, or thoughtful like I have always known him to be. I remember that he told me once that he doesn't feel any emotions, that he knows that he did have them a long time ago, but he doesnt feel anything.That he always tries to do the right thing by learning from others actions and reading books. But I thought he was joking, he likes dark humor and i thought he was just messing with me. I don't know what to do, does he love me? I know im not in danger, he has never yelled at me nor has he ever been violent towards me or in front of me. But why would he, what if he is just indifferent and doesn't care and thats why he has never done that, but he has also always been kind to me, he has helped me with my anxiety and has supported me, and always tells me how proud he is of me. It jus feels like real love to me, but what if he learned that in a book, what if he just thinks its the right thing to do. I don't know, it hurts to think, its driving me crazy.

Im going to confront him in the morning, I will ask him about his past, more details about his painful experienes and ask him about his feeling about me and if its even real.
