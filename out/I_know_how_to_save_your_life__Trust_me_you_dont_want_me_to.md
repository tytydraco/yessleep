I don’t remember the moment I was born.  I don’t think anyone does—no one I know at least.  But knowing what I do now, I picture myself as a brand-new baby, still wet from the womb, staring down an impossibly long and dark hallway.

At the other end of that hallway I can somehow see a figure.  I can see them, and I know they can see me.  I just know it, like my lungs know to breathe and my heart knows to be afraid.  Perhaps in response, perhaps in greeting, they give me a short little wave, the knife in their hand spilling light down the hall.

And then they start running towards me. 

And I begin to scream.

**** 

When I was twenty-three, I saved an old man’s life.  I was working as a waiter at the time—I’d only been at the restaurant three months, and I already had some misgivings compared to my last job.  It was one of the nicest places in town, and counting the tips it paid very well, but it was also more stressful.  Nearly everyone who came in had money, and while some were very nice, others were demanding assholes just looking to take their bad day or general unhappiness out on the help.

Holland Verne hadn’t seemed like an asshole the three times I’d waited on him before, and he was nearing the end of this last dinner without any issues, so I figured I’d get a big tip.  I was busy chastising myself for not being more grateful for such a good-paying job when I saw his whole body begin to hitch.  Was he having a seizure?  Fuck, no, he was choking.

I felt panicked, but glancing around, no one else was even paying him any attention yet.  Setting aside my uncertainties, I ran over and touched his shoulder.  When he looked up at me, his eyes were narrowed to watering slits, but he still seemed to recognize me and be asking for help as he reached out and grabbed my arm with one hand as he silently pawed at his throat with the other.

Nodding, I got behind him enough to pull him out of his chair and do the Heimlich once, twice, three times.  The last time, a wad of steak shot out across the table, knocking over a water glass before disappearing off the far edge like an escaping animal.  People were starting to come up now with concerned murmurs, but the loudest noise was coming from Verne himself as he sucked in lungfuls of grateful air.  Turning to look at me, he gripped the sides of my head with more strength than I’d have thought possible.

“You saved me, boy.”  His eyes were still red and watering, but his gaze was intense as he stared into my eyes.  “You know that, don’t you?”

I nodded slightly in his grip.  “Yeah, I guess so.  Um, no big deal.”

He gave a raw-sounding laugh.  “Take it from someone that might have choked to death a minute ago, it’s a pretty big deal to me.”  Letting go of my head, he slapped me on the shoulder as he raked his eyes across the room.  The manager was running up now, and Verne seemed to pin the man to floor like a bug with his eyes.  “You were the only one with sense enough to help.”

The manager flushed.  “Ah, yes, our man Jeffery here did just the right thing, though rest assured, I was on the way as soon as I noticed something was am-“

Verne cut him off with a sharp shake of his head.  “Go away.”  Not waiting to watch as the manager hustled back toward the kitchen, he returned his gaze to me.  “I owe you for this, and I try to always pay my debts.  If it’s okay with you, I’d ask you to come see me tomorrow at my home.”

I wasn’t sure what to say, but I didn’t want to offend him or get in trouble with the job, so I just nodded.  “Um, yeah.  Sure.”

“Good.  If you’ll be out front here at two tomorrow, I’ll send a car by to get you and bring you out to my house.  Shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours and I can have you back.  Suit you okay?”

“Yessir.”

Verne smiled.  “Good man.”  Letting out a chuckle, he threw down a stack of bills on the table before turning to go.  “You know, I think you’ll find this was a lucky day for both of us.”

**** 

The next afternoon I was picked up in one of those giant luxury sedans you never see in real life.  It was driven by a woman in her forties named Sandy who held the door as I got into the back seat and asked if I wanted a drink or anything before we drove out to “the estate”.  Swallowing, I told her no thank you, which seemed to satisfy her as she glided the car away from the curb and into the traffic of the city.

Sandy didn’t talk as we drove for the thirty minutes to get out of town and into the country.  No questions about why she was picking up some scruffy-looking waiter to go visit her boss as his mansion.  Maybe she knew why already, or maybe she just knew to keep her head down.  It seemed like a good idea to me too, so I just stayed quiet until we got past the first set of gates and my awe took over.

“Is this for real?  This is all his?”

Giving a small laugh, Sandy nodded.  “It is.  It has the main house, a staff house, two garages and a bungalow.  About 200 acres, and that’s just the main grounds.”

I shook my head in disbelief.  “What does he do?  I mean, how is he so rich?”

She shrugged.  “I don’t know all the details.  He owns several companies, and his family has had money for generations I think.  Old money, you know?”

I nodded.  “Sure.  It’s like a movie.  At least he has a family to share it with though.”

I saw her expression change slightly in the mirror.  “Well, he doesn’t have any family that I know of.  No one that lives here or comes to visit.”  We had travelled up the driveway far enough now that an enormous house had come into view.  “We’re here.”

A couple of moments later Sandy had the car stopped and my door open.  “It was a pleasure driving you today.  I’ll be around when you are ready to go.”  She nodded toward the massive front door at the top of rows of marble steps.  “Go on up and ring the bell.  They’re expecting you.”

**** 

A middle-aged man in a tweed suit greeted me at the door, leading me down a series of enormous halls to a study that was three times the size of my apartment.  Seated behind a large desk was Mr. Verne, while closer to the wall a man just a few years older than me sat in a plush leather chair.  The man just gave me a silent nod as I approached, but Mr. Verne stood up and came around the desk, shaking my hand while telling me to sit down and be comfortable.  It wasn’t until he was back around the desk that his expression shifted from jolly to more serious, and it was then he began to speak again.

“Jeffery…is okay if I call you Jeffery?”

I nodded.  “Jeffery, or…well my friends mainly call me just Jeff.”

Verne grinned.  “Well, I consider you a good friend at this point, so I will call you Jeff too.  Jeff…what do people want more than anything in life?”

I felt a small moment of panic.  What was this?  A riddle?  Was he trying to ask some philosophical question?  Feeling the weight of his eyes on me, I blurted out an answer.  “To be happy?”

The older man chuckled.  “When I was your age, I’d have likely said the same thing.  But as you get older, you’ll come to realize it isn’t that simple.  In part because what makes you happy will change over time, but also because the purpose of life isn’t to just be happy.  You need to be happy and sad and scared and angry and excited and…well, all of it.  All of it is necessary and important.  It’s all part of living a full life.”

I frowned, slowly nodding.  “So what people really want is a full life?”

Verne brightened.  “Yes!  That’s much closer to it.  A life that is full of opportunity and that is long enough to take advantage of those opportunities.”  He paused a moment, and when I just nodded, he went on.  “But, of course, not everyone has the same opportunities and the same amount of life.  We are taught that the length of one’s life is a combination of health, access to medicine, genetics and luck.  Much of the more pedestrian current view of reality is based on this presumption.

“And that presumption is, for the most part at least, false.”

I was trying to follow what he was talking about, but it didn’t make a ton of sense, at least not yet.  Still, I wanted to appear attentive, so I piped up.  “That’s not why we live as long as we do?”

Still smiling, he shook his head.  “No.”  Puffing out a breath, he pointed a finger at me.  “I want you to do something for me, Jeff.  I want you to picture a cord—like a rope—that is white and glowing and coming out of the top of your head.  It’s always there, but no one can usually see it.  We’ll call it your lifeline, okay?”

“Um, okay.”

“You picturing it?”

“Yeah, yessir.”

“Good.  Now I also want you to picture a world underneath this world.  Maybe it looks just like this one, but it’s mostly empty, or maybe it looks like grey nothing to you.  That doesn’t really matter for now.  What does matter is the hallway.”

“Hallway?”

He leaned forward over the desk.  “Yes.  The hallway.  You see a long, long, long hallway in front of you when you look into that underneath world.  No matter which way you look down there, the hallway is in front of you, stretching away.  And down that hallway, hopefully very far away, is something running towards you.”

I felt my skin beginning to prickle.  “What?  What is it?”

Verne’s voice was barely above a rough whisper now.  “They have different names, but none of that matter.  What matters is that thing has been with you since you were born.  We all have one, and this one is yours.  It has been with you, running toward you down that unseen hallway, one step for every moment you’re alive.  And if it reaches you, it will cut your cord, your lifeline, and you will die.”

This all sounded like weird religious crap, or some new age thing, but it was still scaring me.  And I didn’t want to offend him, especially if he was going to reward me with money or something for saving his life and humoring him.   “So this is what is going to kill me?  This is why people die?”

Leaning back in his chair, Verne laughed softly.  “I’ll answer your second question first.  Yes, this is why most people die.  It’s blamed on car accidents and bad hearts, no one realizing that those things are just manifestations of their cord being cut.  Sometimes it happens in a second, sometimes it’s drawn out over months or even years, like when someone is sick a long time before they die.  The world we live in can somehow sense the thing that is coming for us, and it shapes itself to suit, be it quick or slow.  In other words, most deaths are just this reality’s way of explaining why a person cannot possess their body any longer.”

I nodded slowly.  “Okay.  Um, so was that what happened when you choked yesterday?  Your runner or whatever was trying to cut your lifeline?”

Smiling broadly, he wagged a finger at me.  “You’re catching on, and I’m glad to see it.  That’s a fair question.  But no, my…what did you call it? Runner?  My runner was dealt with a long time ago.  I can still die, but the likelihood is very low, including yesterday.  I played up my peril yesterday because that’s what most people would expect, and I want to reward you because you tried to help me, even if I likely would have been fine either way.  In your mind, you were saving my life, and that’s good enough for me.”

I frowned at him.  “So what, you just…like death just ignores you?  If I haven’t helped, the meat would have just gotten loose on its own?  Or do you not need to breathe now?”  I felt myself growing both excited and angry at what he was saying.  It was all insane, so was he trying to trick me?  Or was there some chance it was true?

Verne stared at me for several moments before responding.  “I still need to breathe and eat and drink just like anyone.  But I am more…slippery now.   And yes, the meat would have probably resolved on its own before I actually got hurt, though even now, the feeling of choking causes me some panic.”  He let out a small sigh.  “How old do you think I am?”

I pondered the question for a minute.  “Um, maybe late sixties?”

He nodded.  “A fair guess.  When I stopped my runner, I was sixty-seven years old.  And that was over eighty years ago.”

My eyes widened as I stared at him.  “What?  You’re saying you’re what…like almost 150 years old?”

His face was solemn and serious now, all trace of humor gone.  “I am, yes.  And while it is not without its pitfalls, I have the perspective to see it as the gift that it truly is.  And it’s a gift I’d like to give to you.”  He gestured to the man sitting nearby in the chair.  “This man’s name is unimportant, but he is a member of an organization that specialize in this very thing for a very small and select clientele.  It is the same group I employed when I was thirty-five and searching for treasures only someone of my resources could find or afford.”

Even with how baffled I was at all of this, the age caught me.  “Thirty-five?  I thought you were sixty-seven when they…um, stopped your runner or whatever.”

Verne smiled at me.  “Just so.  But this isn’t something you can order like a pizza, expecting it to arrive in a few minutes.  And it’s not a vampire movie where someone just makes another person immortal.  It requires not just resources, but foresight and patience and, perhaps most of all, trust.”  He chopped his hands down on the desk, one at a time and far apart.  “Everyone’s hall is a different length, or perhaps different runners travel at different speeds.  Regardless, it’s not a switch you can just flip off.  Instead, you sign up with them.  After that, they keep track of you, throughout your life, until your runner is nearly on top of you.  Then they contact you.  Meet you.  And stop the thing that would cut your cord and end your life.  Maybe you’ll be forty.  Maybe eighty.  But the vast majority of the time, when your new friends do come calling, you’ll still be alive because the thing that will kill you hasn’t reached you yet.  And after that, your life is…more than it ever has been before…your own.”

It was strange.  There was a deep, rational part of my brain telling me that this was all insane.  A cruel rich person’s game or an old man’s senile ramblings.  And yet.  And yet at the core of me, I not only wanted to believe what he was saying, what he was offering, but I found that I did.

“I know what you’re thinking now, Jeff.  The same as I was, and you grew up in a much more scientifically-minded era, for good or ill.  And if you refuse this gift, I respect that and won’t trouble you again.  But if you agree, all you have to do is provide your contact information.  I have already paid for your service, and they will keep track of any changes in your phone numbers and addresses and whatnot over the years without you needing to do anything.  If I’m insane or lying to you, you’re out nothing.  If I’m not, then one day down the line, you will get a knock at your door, or a stranger will greet you at work or the supermarket or the hospital.  And if you go with them, they will save your life.”

I sat silent for several moments, trying to find a flaw in what he was saying, trying to fight my gut feeling that I was being giving a very rare and special chance.  But he was right.  What did I have to lose if it was bullshit?  He was the one paying for it, after all.

Leaning forward, I met Mr. Verne’s eyes.  “I’ll do it.”

****

Most isolated events, no matter how strange or impactful feeling at the time they happen, tend to fade with time.  The accrual of new memories, the distance from what you actually thought and felt at the time, with enough living even the most magnificent past miracle can come to feel mundane.  

That’s what happened to my impressions of the day that I signed up for the service.  For weeks I thought about it every day—and not just the surrealness of it all.  If it was all real, and I felt there was a chance that it was, then I had to reconcile that there was some…thing stalking me in another dimension next to, or below, ours.  I also had to allow for the possibility that if all went according to plan, I might be living for a very long time.

But that was only at first.  Day to day life has its ways of numbing you to the extraordinary, and it wasn’t long before I thought about it less, and when I did, I became increasingly dismissive of the idea that any of it could be real.  That flame of faith I’d felt sitting in that study was buried and out of sight by the time I’d started a career and started facing the realities of adult life without the safety net of telling myself that I was still just a kid.  By the time I was thirty, I think I’d mostly forgotten about it altogether.

At least consciously.  Because looking back now, I could see that I made certain choices that I might not have made if I didn’t have this promise, this shadow, hanging over me.  I focused mainly on my career, for instance.  Not because I was particularly ambitious, but I think some part of me wanted to make sure I had enough resources to continue funding a comfortable life if I lived a really long time.  And while I’d often use my work schedule as an excuse for why I didn’t date more often, a part of me knew that was a lie.  The truth was, I was afraid to get too close to someone.  And in retrospect, I think that was mainly due to the conversation I had with Mr. Verne after I filled out the paperwork that night.

The other man had already left at that point, and I wasn’t sure if Verne wanted me to go ahead and leave too, but then he invited me to stay and chat for a bit.  Ask other questions if I had any.  So settling back into my chair, I tried to think of questions, and felt a flush of embarrassment as several came to mind.  Had I really agreed to this without asking more?  I guessed I could still cancel it if I wanted, but still, had I been so hungry for the chance he was offering that I’d leap at it without another thought or concern?  Pushing the thought away, I asked my first question.

“So can you still get sick?  I mean, can you get cancer and be in terrible pain but not be able to die?”

Verne’s eyes widened as he gave a startled laugh.  “A macabre thought.  That would be terrible, wouldn’t it?  But no, I don’t think that’s much of an option.  As I said, you become much more slippery.  Most diseases and accidents that cause significant harm are really just precursors to your death.  Reality setting the stage, if you will.  You have a heart attack at 40 that doesn’t kill you, or you get cancer but it goes into remission.  That’s not you dodging a bullet, and it’s not unrelated to whatever “kills” you.  It’s you being positioned into the right spot for whatever reality manifests when your cord is actually cut, whether you die from a gas leak or a birth defect.”  He went on.  “Conversely, when you are no longer in Death’s sights, so to speak, most of those things simply don’t happen to you anymore.  Not only don’t you feel sick or in pain, but you feel the best you’ve ever felt, at least relative to your age, as most of the problems that come with aging aren’t there anymore.”  He laughed a little.  “I may look like an old fogey, but I’d guess I probably feel better than you most days.”

I grinned and nodded.  “Okay, well that sounds awesome.  Um, but like what about your family?  Like if I get married and have kids, can I get the service for them too?”

His smile disappeared suddenly as he looked away.  “No.  It’s one of their rules.  Believe me, I tried to get them to break it, but they won’t.  Once someone uses the service, no one else in their family can while they remain alive.  Same thing for your close friends, and believe me, they keep track.”  He felt silent for a moment before seeming to shake off a past memory and return his gaze to me.  “Referrals and gifts to others is possible, but very rare.  It has to be a situation like this where we are relative strangers, and the cost is high enough that few people are willing to pay it for a stranger.”

“So…so you outlive everyone you care about?”

Verne sighed and gave a nod.  “You do.  And I won’t lie, it’s very hard at first.  Being so long-lived can be very lonely if you let it be.  Some people aren’t made for it.  But you can make new connections with people, of course.  And the longer you live, the more used to it you become.  You start to see other people a bit like…well, a bit like pets.”

I raised an eyebrow.  “Pets?”

He smirked.  “Well I guess that sounded horrible, didn’t it?  I don’t mean it in a demeaning fashion.  But a dog or cat might live…what?  Fifteen or twenty years if you’re lucky.  And yet people still have them and love them, knowing that they will wind up outliving them most of the time.”  The humor in his expression faded away.  “The passage of so much time changes you, and your priorities change.  What makes you happy.”

Studying him for a moment, I decided to ask one more question.

“What makes you happy, Mr. Verne?”

“Holland, please.  We are friends now, after all.”

I smiled.  “Sure.  Holland then.  What makes you happy?”

He smiled back at me broadly.  “Living, of course.”

**** 

I was thirty-seven when it happened.  Walking across the third-level parking deck of my office building, I was already running late.  Thirty minutes until my meeting and I still had at least fifteen minutes of preparations to get done.

“Pardon me…sir.”

As I turned around, I could already feel growing irritation.  Were they letting people into the parking deck to hit us up for money now?  How long before someone got their car stolen or was attacked?  I wasn’t trying to…

It was two women, one around my age, the other maybe twenty.  Both were wearing long black overcoats, and though the light wasn’t great in the parking deck, I could make out the glint of a thin, silvery chain running from the wrist of the older woman to up the bottom of the other’s cinched coat.  What the fuck?

“Forgive the abruptness…of our arrival…and the strangeness…of our presentation.  It is…all necessary…I assure you.”  The older woman touched her tongue to the back of her teeth with every word, which came out rough and breathy, almost like a burp.  The younger woman glanced around twitchily, but if she even knew I was there, I couldn’t tell.

“Who are you?  What is this?”

“We are here…to protect you.  To honor…the compact.”

I felt my pulse thudding in my skull as my thoughts began to race.  “You’re…you’re talking about the service, right?  The one I signed up for through Mr. Verne?”

“I am.”

I thought about the meeting.  Fuck me.  “Um, look.  How much time do I have?  I have this important work thing this morning.  Do I have time to do it first?”

“You don’t.  We have followed…you for three…days.  Waited as long…as possible…because early…disruption can lead…to unpredictable results.  If you will…accept our help…you must come…now.  We have…a suitable place…already selected…for the quelling.”

I felt a thrill of fear.  “How close is it?”

The woman’s expression didn’t change.  “It will be…upon you…in less than two hours.”

**** 
They led me to an SUV parked down just a few spaces from my own car, and the woman told me to get into the front seat, as she had to sit next to the girl.  I said hello to the driver, who was a man in his fifties, but he just nodded and smiled before putting the car in reverse and taking us out of the parking deck.

We rode in silence for the next half hour, my stomach twisting with a poison mixture of fear of these strange, unknown people and terror at what might be running me down unseen as we pushed through early morning traffic and headed out into the suburbs.  I didn’t even know where we were going and I was still constantly looking at the dash clock, worried we wouldn’t make it there in time.

I could feel a sense of urgency from the others as well, but no nerves or fear.  Well, not from the driver or the older woman.  I could hear the younger woman shifting in her seat constantly, and then I thought she let out a small whimper.  I turned around to try and say something to her, but the other woman put a gentle hand on my shoulder.

“Better to not…talk to her.  It can…confuse her.  Distract her.  And she…cannot hunt as well…distracted.”

Shuddering slightly, I nodded and faced forward again.  A couple of minutes later we turned off onto a small side road that led to a state park I hadn’t even known existed.  We parked and the woman told me to get out before her and the girl did the same.  I glanced at the driver to see if he was coming, but he just gave me a silent nod before staring back out the windshield.

By the time I was out, the woman was already closing the rear door of the SUV.  She’d taken something from the back—was that an umbrella?  I almost asked if it was supposed to rain, but then I looked closer at it.  It was an umbrella of a sort, but it had sharp ridges along the outside of its ribs, with peaks and valleys that looked like grey rock shot through with bits of silver or steel that also ran in small chains between the rocky segments running up to the point of the umbrella, which looked like…

“Is that a dagger?  On the tip, I mean?”

The woman held up the umbrella with a practiced twirl.  “It is…a misericorde.”

I blinked.  “Um, okay.  I don’t know what that means.”  I looked around.  “So where do we go?  Aren’t we running low on time?”

She pointed with the umbrella at the marked trail.  “This way.  There is a…clearing.  Half a mile.  We have…time.”

The girl suddenly gave a short shuddering squeal as she stared past me.  “It’s coming.  It’s coming.  It’s coming.  It’s coming.  It’s…”

The woman raised her eyebrows.  “But we should…walk quickly.”

**** 

“…ing.  It’s coming.  It’s coming.”

I wanted to tell the girl to shut up, that we knew, that I was closer to pissing my pants than I’d been in over thirty years, but I didn’t want to fuck up whatever they were doing either.  We had just gotten to the clearing, and I was about to ask what was next when the woman spoke up again.

“This is the…final call.  Do you…accept our protection?”

I blinked.  Hadn’t I already?  Her asking me again made me wonder and question what I actually knew about all of this, which if I was honest, was next to nothing.

“It’s coming, it’s coming, it’s coming, it’s coming.”

“What are my options?  Like if I say yes, what are the possible results?”

She nodded as though she expected the question.  “If you say yes…there are…three possibilities.  One…we quell your…pursuer and you…live without…fear of death.  Two…we miss your…pursuer and you…die.  In that…case, the…next of kin…you indicated…will get the…full refund…of fifty million…U.S. dollars.”

I swallowed.  Fuck.  He paid that much?  It didn’t matter, I needed to know this all fast.  “What’s three?”

“It’s coming, it’s coming, it’s coming…”

“We deflect…the pursuer…but it…is not quelled.  You live without…dying.  You receive half…payment back as…recompense.”

“What?  What’s the difference between one and thr…”

“It’s com…It’s here!”

The woman looked to the girl and back to me as I nodded.  “Yes, I agree!”

Instantly she turned and stepped between me and the girl, raising the umbrella in front of her before opening it with a screeching sound.  Holding it out like a shield, she twirled it faster and faster, tracking the space the girl was pointing to as the younger woman screeched.

“It’s here, it’s here, it’s here, it’s…now!”

In one fluid movement, the woman closed the umbrella and spun around, her entire body moving behind a home run swing as she came back to face the empty air that…

The umbrella jolted as it connected with the air, and then I could see the outline of something.  Not something…my runner.  It had two arms and legs, but the lengths and angles seemed all wrong, and as it hit the ground, I could see it craning its long neck to look at me.  This was more what I felt than saw, as there were no details, not really.  It was like I was looking at a shadow that wasn’t dark, which makes no sense.  But I could still see it as it tried to get to its feet, and I could feel its eyes burning into me as it tried to dart past the woman who had struck it down.

Grunting, the woman stepped in between us again, slamming the umbrella into it twice more.  Both strikes sounded strange, like the tolling of some distant bell, and they did drive it back down, but it was still moving, trying to scratch and crawl its way to me.  Turning the umbrella, she stepped to the side and drove it down, aiming the bladed tip for what might be the back or side of the thing.

But no.  It had been faking how hurt it was, or maybe it was just desperate, but either way, it dodged to the side and took a leap towards me.  I didn’t have time to scream or try to run.  Just a moment’s thought that I was about to die.

The umbrella’s tip slashed the air an inch in front of my nose as she brought it down on the killing shape one more time.  She instantly shifted to attacking the ground where it hit, but I couldn’t see it anymore.

The girl gave a short laugh.  “It got away.”

The woman grunted discontentedly.  “Fuck.”  Wiping her forehead, she turned to look at me.  “I…I’m sorry.  We have…driven it from…you.   You will…live.  But it is…not properly quelled.  It will…continue along the…hallway…injured and angry.”

I stared at her.  “What does that mean?  Can it come back to get me?”

She shook her head solemnly.  “The current…has pulled…it past.”

I frowned.  “Well then what’s the problem?  How is it still in the hallway if it can’t get me?”

The woman met my eyes.  “You only think…of the path…ahead of you.  It runs…behind you too.”

**** 

The next day I had a check for twenty-five million dollars.  And Verne was right—I did feel better than I’d felt in years.  Not only healthier, but like an enormous weight had been lifted from me.  I tried to call Mr. Verne to thank him, but the man that answered at his house said he was in Europe until the spring.  He promised to pass along my message, however.

My protectors hadn’t given me any more information as they carried me back to the parking deck, despite my insistent questions.  The girl was fast asleep as soon as we got in the car, and the woman simply said there was no more she could tell.  It should have worried me from the start, but I felt so good, and when I got the money the next day, I was about the happiest I’d ever been.  It was all real, wasn’t it?  I was going to be able to have whatever kind of life I wanted for as long as I wanted.  It was like a dream.

I got a letter from Mr. Verne a week later with a Venice postmark.

So sorry that things turned out like they did.  They do have a very high success rate, and this is still largely a success.  We will talk more in the future, and if you ever need me, do not hesitate to call.

I felt a stab of worry as I read and reread the letter, and I considered calling him again right then, but thought better of it.  This was my life now, more than it ever had been.  And I was going to start living it.

The first five years were actually pretty wonderful.  I quit my job and travelled.  Learned new things, met all kinds of people.  I think I lost a thing or two during that time, but I was gaining so much that I didn’t notice.

It took that five years before something big went missing.  My friend from work, Jesse.  We’d met when I started working at the company at 32, and even when she left for a job upstate three years later, we still talked every week and got together whenever we could.  I’d long thought that if I wasn’t so “focused on work” I’d have wanted us to be more than friends.  Looking back, of course, I didn’t tell her how I felt because I was afraid of losing her.

It's funny how it happens.  It’s not the same as forgetting.  I remember the people that should be there.  I even have the memories.  But they’ve been robbed of all sensation and emotion, as though they were a story someone told me once.  I know I should feel something, but I don’t.  And when I called her, she didn’t even remember who I am.

That was twenty-two years ago.  I’m technically 64 years old now, but I don’t look a day over 37.  And over that time I’ve watched the thing that wanted to kill me just eat chunks of my past life instead.  My first love.  My first job.  My little sister last month.  All the things I’m proud of, or regret or love…all the memories have become pale, meaningless shadows and all the people have become strangers, to them in reality and to me in my heart.  If it keeps at its current pace, my parents wouldn’t know me around my eighty-fourth birthday, though they’ll likely both be dead in the next few years.  Not that I’m really keeping count.

Because age doesn’t really matter anymore.  Nothing does.  I’ve talked to Holland about it several times, and he always says the same things.  Give it time, make new memories, find new people to love.  All good advice, if I could find a way to make it matter.  

He was finally a bit more honest with me when I visited him last week.  I asked him about how he dealt with his family and friends dying.  He put down his cigar and gave a shrug.  

“It was hard.  Very hard at first.  I felt like I was betraying them by not dying.  By not being able to do more for them.”  His eyes were watery and he wiped at them absently as he continued.  “But you learn to move on.  To enjoy yourself without them.  To ignore how guilty enjoying anything without them makes you feel.”

I sighed.  “I’m sorry, Holland.  I know that was hard.  I just…I feel like I’m losing myself too.  So much of my past life is just…gone.  And I can still feel the holes.”

Holland nodded.  “I know.  And I am sorry.  I hate that they botched it the way they did.”  He forced a smile.  “But you’ll get through it.”

“How do you know that?”

He pulled out a desk drawer and removed a revolver.  Before I could even cry out, he put it against his head and started pulling the trigger.  I was yelling now, but I could still hear every time it clicked without firing.  He pulled the trigger six times before he took it away from his temple.  Then, absently aiming it at the wall, he pulled the trigger again.

The sound of the gun going off was thunderous, like the ringing of some dooming bell.

He had no smile to offer as he met my eyes.  “Because what choice [do you have?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Verastahl/) "
