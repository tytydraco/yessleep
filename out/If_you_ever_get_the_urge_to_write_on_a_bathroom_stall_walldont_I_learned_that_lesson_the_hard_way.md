When I was a teenager my parents divorced. Nothing special. Happens all the time. My dad was quick to put distance between my mom and me, moving a state away. Though he had the legal right to see me once a month, he opted not to deal with the drive. Instead, I stayed at his house for a month each summer.

It wasn’t my favorite time of the year. He lived in a small Midwestern town where I knew no one and had little to do. I spent most of my time riding his old bike along the decommissioned railroad tracks and skipping rocks through a muddy creek. The only portion of the whole affair I looked forward to was the drive there and back.


About midway between my mom and my dad, on a lonely stretch of highway that cut like a scythe through the golden fields of wheat, was a truck stop. Not just any truck stop. This was the *World’s Largest Truck Stop*. Even as a teenager, I doubted the veracity of that claim. How could *anything* in the Midwest be the largest of something? Surely there was nothing so notable in this vast, rusted land.

But it *was* big. There was a laundromat and a bar and a dentist. There was a massive store that stocked a massive array of glittering chrome truck accessories. It had rows of audio books and an entire wall filled with wolf and wizard shirts. I always begged my dad for one on the way back. And that’s how I ended up with a small collection of hyper-detailed wildlife and fantasy tees.

Of course, there was also an enormous public restroom. There must have been at least twenty stalls. Despite it’s tourist-baiting pedigree, this truck stop wasn’t particularly well-kept. There was a thin veneer of grime over everything. The floors were constant swirls of dirt and red gravel. The bathrooms weren’t much better: there were always pools of still water on the wall-length counter-tops and collecting in corners. And no one ever seemed to locate the garbage, leaving their crumpled paper towels strewn about the floor where they blew around like tumbleweed.

Naturally, like any grungy bathroom, there was a wide variety of graffiti coating the stall walls”. 

There were the old classics like “Jesus Saves” (and underneath, “But he can’t save me from gas station burritos.”) and “I hate vandalism.” A “Hail Satin” scribbled around a crude pentagram (and I don’t think they meant to worship the fabric). And every manner of dick you could ever imagine. Big ones. Short ones. Veiny ones. Girthy ones. Stick figures with penises for heads. Or penis guns. And on and on. 

When I went out to my dad’s that first summer, I was firmly engrossed in my “edgy” phase and was eager to add my own infantile message to the rest. I picked a middle stall that was relatively devoid of art and wrote directly on the door at eye-level, so that anyone sitting down would immediately see my chicken scratch. That was prime real estate.

At the time, the thing at the forefront of my mind was a bully at my school: *Arnold*. He was the type of person who would go out of his way to find me during a passing period, just so he could knock the books out of my arms. The type of person who deliberately aimed at heads in dodgeball, and whipped his throws as hard as possible.

What a prick.

So I took out my black Sharpie and wrote my own classic: “For a good time call Arnold at [Phone number redacted].” Like a truly resentful ball of angst, I put his actual home phone number.

Then I was gone and forgot all about it until the end of my month with my dad. On the way back, I used the restroom and recalled what I had written. Of course, I was excited to see if my lewd message had attracted any replies. Back then, bathroom wall graffiti was like a sort of cringe-inducing public square: a place for all manner of perverse and childish discourse.

Below my message, in red ink was a reply: “I called but no one answered.”

I chuckled to myself. Back then, I really did hope that someone had called him. He deserved nothing less for his cruel behavior.

 I could have left things there, but I couldn’t help my desire to egg things on. So, I wrote something I greatly regret: “Why don’t you give him a visit? He’s always happy to have company. [Address Redacted].”

When the school year started, I didn’t notice that Arnold wasn’t around until one of my friend’s pointed it out to me. It was a welcome relief. We figured that his parents had moved east to one of the larger cities. Our town was midsized but slowly dying. It wouldn’t be the first or last time we loss a classmate to that long exodus. Jonesboro is a shadow of its former self these days, but that’s a story for another time.

I didn’t think about Arnold again until the following summer, when I was once again on the long drive to my dad’s. We stopped at the *World’s Largest Truck Stop* and, after perusing the selection of salty snacks, I used the restroom. 

As soon as I set foot on those cracked and yellowed square tiles, I remembered my stall door conversation. I quickly located that middle stall, locked the door behind me and sat down. 

There was a new message, written in the same hand and with the same red marker: “Thanks for the tip. I got the best head of my life :)”

Something about the message unnerved me. It was just as crass and immature as anything you’d expect to see there. I mean, on the right-hand wall of the stall someone had scrawled the message “Jessica’s mom has huge tits” above a crude rendering of the apparent mother in question. I think it was the smiley-face that felt weird to me. Like it really was a genuine nod of appreciation. 

That and the penmanship was oddly perfect. Whoever was writing those messages lacked the unsteady, jagged hand of everyone else. Their script was comprised of perfect lines and pristine curves. It seemed out of place next to the other harried scribbles.

I don’t know what it was that possessed me, but I wrote again, just beneath their message, “I’m sure he’d do it for you anytime.”

That summer visit was another relatively uneventful one—aside from meeting my dad’s new girlfriend, who was surprisingly pleasant. Of course, I was too immature to appreciate her efforts then and spent much of my time brooding alone.

On the quiet ride home, we stopped at the truck stop once more. Back in the restroom. It was a little odd, but I got a little thrill wondering whether there would be a response and what it might be. When I sat down this time, though, I felt my stomach churn.

“Arnold’s all used up. Need someone new. What about you? :)”

There was a clacking of metal in the stall next to mine. The unbuckling of a belt. I nearly jumped out of my skin. This time I didn’t write a response. It was starting to feel too personal. I booked it out of that restroom without looking back. I was in such a rush that I didn’t even snag the black bear shirt I had decided to grab for a souvenir. I locked myself in my dad’s truck and waited. Didn’t utter a word the rest of the way home.

It was in October that a fisherman pulled a headless torso from the Sangamon River. It was that same month that I found out Arnold hadn’t moved. He had been missing for over a year. To people that cared, it was big news when he disappeared. But not a lot of people cared.

They never did find the head. Nor the killer. So, no one could definitively say it was Arnold’s body. I imagine it’s still sitting in a morgue somewhere, waiting for the final piece of the puzzle. Of course, I know it’s him. It has to be.

And me? Well, I didn’t go back to my dad’s the next summer. I blamed it on his new girlfriend. Told him I didn’t want to be around them. I regret that too. But I couldn’t tell him or my mom the truth. I couldn’t tell them I wasn’t going back because—even if we didn’t stop at that truck stop—I was terrified of who might be watching me. Looking back, it seems irrational. But I realized later that the address I provided wasn’t even Arnold’s. Right house number, wrong street. And so I wondered how they found him. 

And, even more, I wondered who else I might have condemned…
