I’ve always been a night owl. Coding projects, late-night whiskey, and the occasional doom scroll on Reddit keep me up well past midnight. But that night felt different. The air in my apartment was thick, suffocatingly quiet. Even the usual creaks of the old wooden floor were absent.

Then came the knock.

A single, deliberate *thud* against my front door. Not frantic, not casual—just one solid knock.

I froze. I wasn’t expecting anyone. My phone, sitting next to my keyboard, showed no notifications. I live alone, and it was well past 3 AM.

Curiosity got the better of me. I crept to the peephole and peered through.

Fog. Thick, rolling fog. It blanketed the hallway, curling under the dim flickering light. No one was there. Just as I exhaled in relief, another *thud* echoed through the apartment. But this time, it wasn’t from the front door.

It came from inside.

My head snapped toward my bedroom door. It was slightly ajar, though I was sure I had closed it earlier. My heart pounded. The silence was unbearable.

Then, I heard it—a slow, shallow breath coming from the darkness beyond the doorway.

Every instinct screamed at me to run, but my feet wouldn’t move. I grabbed my phone, fumbling for the flashlight, but before I could turn it on, the bedroom door creaked open a little more. A long, gnarled hand, fingers too thin, too long, reached around the frame.

The breath became a whisper. A voice—raspy, broken—murmured just one word:

“Kaan.”

Adrenaline kicked in. I stumbled back, knocking over my chair, and bolted for the front door. But as I reached for the handle, the power cut out. The apartment was plunged into darkness.

Behind me, the bedroom door slammed shut.

The knocking resumed. This time, it was everywhere—walls, ceiling, floor. A deafening, chaotic rhythm.

Then—silence.

My phone buzzed in my hand. The screen flickered, lighting up just enough to show a single notification.

A video message.

With shaking fingers, I pressed play.

It was live footage from my bedroom. The camera faced my bed, where the sheets lay undisturbed.

Then, the camera panned.

In the corner stood a figure. Too tall. Too still. Watching. Waiting.

The screen glitched, then went black.

The knocking returned—this time, right behind me.

I spun around, but the darkness swallowed everything. The air grew colder, and the smell of damp earth filled my nostrils, like something had been buried deep within my apartment walls. A whisper—low, guttural—called my name again, but this time, it came from multiple voices, layered over each other like a distorted echo.

My phone vibrated again. Another message.

I hesitated, my thumb hovering over the screen. When I finally opened it, the video played automatically.

It was footage of me. Right there, in the apartment, staring at my phone. But something was wrong. In the video, behind my shoulder, a dark figure loomed. Its head twitched unnaturally, its mouth stretched into an impossible grin.

I whipped around, but nothing was there.

The video continued. The figure leaned closer. Its hand reached toward me. The screen glitched and cut to static. A new message appeared:

**“Look behind you.”**

My breath hitched. I didn’t want to. But some unseen force compelled me. Slowly, I turned my head.

A face, inches from my own—eyes hollow, skin rotting, mouth still forming my name.

The lights flickered back on. The fog in the hallway had seeped inside, swirling around my feet. The knocking had stopped, replaced by a sound much worse.

Scraping. Nails against wood.

The bedroom door opened again, wider this time. Inside, the darkness moved, pulsing like something alive. A shape stepped forward.

It was me.

A perfect copy. Same hoodie, same sweatpants, same terrified expression.

The doppelgänger raised a hand, pointing directly at me. Then it smiled. I felt an invisible force yank me backward. My vision blurred as the apartment twisted around me.

Then, just before everything went black, I heard the figure speak.

“You were never supposed to leave.”

I woke up in my bed, gasping for air, drenched in sweat. My phone was next to me, the screen dimly lit. A single notification glowed:

**“Welcome home.”**

I bolted upright. My bedroom door was closed, just as I had left it before. The apartment was silent again. Too silent.

Something felt… wrong.

I reached for my phone and flipped on the camera, slowly turning it toward the mirror across the room.

My reflection blinked a second too late.

Then it smiled.

The knocking started again.

I don't know who to ask for help........
