It happened abruptly on a plane. 

I was woken up by some turbulence, and instead of going back to sleep, I stood up and demanded the nearest stewardess to bring me some sugar water. 

My voice was coarse, and I could feel every muscle tense across my body—as if I was preparing to do a backflip.

After crushing a Mountain Dew, I practically barked like a dog: “More! MORE SUGAR!”

It was terrifying.

Something awful had seized all executive functions of my brain—that’s the best way I could put it. It's like my consciousness got kicked out of the driver's seat, and was forced to watch everything from a cage.

I could still *see,* and *hear,* and *feel* every sensation in my body … I just had no input. No control over what I did.

“Mam, please calm down. We’ll get you some soda.”

“Sugar me, NOW!”

Horror quickly blended with embarrassment. I guzzled a dozen soft drinks in less than three minutes, which resulted in vomit all over my pants. People gasped, got up and moved away. I became ‘that woman’ on the plane.

“Do we have to restrain you mam?”

“Not if sugar I more have.”

\*\*\*

Instead of heading home towards my husband and two daughters in Toronto, I went straight to the travel counter to book a new flight.

“Lost. Angels.”

“Excuse me ma'am?”

“Plane me.”

“You'd like to book a flight to Los Angeles, is that right?”

Despite speaking in broken monosyllables, everyone was very willing to help.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m very thankful that I live in a very progressive, nice part of the world that somehow tolerates strange speech and vomit-stained pants, but for once I just wanted an asshole to call me out for a ‘random screening’.

I wanted someone to detain the insanity controlling my body. Instead, I helplessly watched my visa get charged a fortune.

First Class. Extra legroom. Next available flight.

\*\*\*

Upon arriving in California, a group of women dressed in very fancy blazers held out a sign for me. The sign said Simone. Which was my name.

The palest one wearing cat-eye sunglasses approached with a glossy-toothed smile. “Hello gorgeous. How was the flight?”

“Divine.” The Thing Controlling Me said.

“Good. Let’s freshen you up.”

*\*\*\**

In public, the women laughed and talked about fictional renovations. Everyone would take turns talking about ‘sprucing up their patio’ or how they were ‘building a yoga den’.

In private however, the women spoke in wet gagging noises—as if they were trying to make speech sounds not designed for human mouths.

The whole car ride from the airport, I was engulfed in drowning duck sounds. As a means of distraction (and potential escape), I tried to focus on what was being ‘squawked’, but that got me nowhere. The language was indecipherable. The one who wore a sunhat which obscured her eyes was honking at me especially. *“Hreeeonk”* she said,  pointing at me, over and over again. “Hreeeonk! Hreeeonk!”

The only consistency I could make out in their language is that whenever they spoke to the sunglasses leader, they would make the same double gagging sound. “Guack-Guack.”

And so, imprisoned in the backseat of my brain, I mentally started to make notes. 

* *The leader I will call ‘GG’.*
* *My name is … ‘Hreeeonk’ ?*

\*\*\*

As we swerved through a busier commercial district, GG slowed her driving, in fact, everyone in the minivan became quiet and started scanning the surroundings.

The car pulled over a curb, near a preacher who was proselytizing by a rack of pamphlets. He might have been a Mormon or a Jehovah's witness.

GG stepped out first, followed by what I would call her right hand loyalist— a woman who perpetually wore a violet scarf. 

From the crack of my window, I watched GG and Violet introduce themselves as fellow evangelicals. They said we were all going to a public prayer, and that we could use more preachers outside to attract attendees.

“That's very kind of you to invite me,” The man said. “ But I'm used to just sticking to my corner here.”

They insisted, and said it was all for the greater good, but the man still politely declined. 

“You should know something,” GG said, and took off her sunglasses. Something in her eyes had the man absolutely captivated. 

“We are angels. Sent by God.”

There was a pause. The preacher continued to stare without blinking. “You're … what?”

“And we're having a congregation.”

The car's windows rolled down, revealing our six woman crew. At this point I should mention that before I became bodysnatched (and even before I became a mom), I was a fashion model for many years.

In fact, all of these possessed women looked like idyllic models, with their long shiny hair and unblemished faces. We were basically a postcard for Sephora.

“You … “ The preacher gawked at all of us. “ You're angels?”

He didn't object when Violet grabbed his rack of brochures, and placed it in the trunk. And he also didn't object when GG led him into the passenger seat in front of me.

The car doors closed and we were off again in seconds. 

“So does this mean the end times are near?” He was visibly stunned. Laughing.

Violet, who sat beside me, secured a gold ring along her finger. A dart-like needle protruded from it.

“Something like that.”

She slinked an elbow over his shoulder and stabbed the ring into his neck.

“Ow! Hey! What’re you? What is that?”

Violet pulled away. “What? This? It’s Bulgari. Off Sak’s on Ventura.”

“Why does it burn?” The man clasped his wound, patting it as if it were on fire.  “Ahh! AAAAAAHHHH!”

After a few squirms and moans, he fell completely limp. All the women honked an aggressive nasal sound. A celebration. The Thing Controlling Me joined in, honking at full volume.

\*\*\*

The abandoned hotel they inhabited was somewhere between Los Angeles and Bakersfield. It was hard to be precise because my eyes weren't always looking out the window.

“Let me give you the grand tour,” Violet said, or at least that's what I assume the seal-like barking coming from her mouth meant.

The foyer was filled with flats upon flats of energy drinks. Monster, Red Bull, Rockstar, and dozens of other brands that all looked the same.

Our bedrooms looked all like normal hotel bedrooms. Except there were massive locks on the outside handles.

Violet also gave me a peek at the rooftop balcony patio—where I wish I could have averted my gaze, or closed my eyes, instead of staring right at the pile.

There were about two dozen bodies. Each one lifeless, each one dressed in very nice clothes, their ‘’Sunday best”. The preacher was dumped to the back half of the pile. The side with all the priests.

It reeked bad as some of the corpses were clearly decomposing, but The Thing Controlling Me wasn’t bothered by the smell.

Violet laughed her goose-honk laugh and took me downstairs.

\*\*\*

It was in the dining room where everyone stood in a circle, awaiting my arrival. 

Formerly, this must have been a space where they held buffets and parties, but now it was just a completely bare room with energy drinks and glass pipes on the floor. 

GG came up and handed me a four-pack of Guinness tall cans. The Thing Controlling Me proceeded to guzzle each one.

For the first time, my conscious state became fuzzy—the jet lag and sleep deprivation was finally catching up. I slowly brought myself to the floor.

The rest of them smiled and honked as my hands curled beneath my head. I fell asleep.

\*\*\*

A kick to the stomach woke me up. I rolled away and grimaced, staring at the black Prada heels worn by GG.

It was a full minute of reflexive dodging before I realized that it was now *me* who was crawling and sniveling.  The real me. *I* was moving my own limbs and shielding my face. *I* was shriveling up in a corner and screaming like a maniac.

“Please! Let me go! Please!!”

Somehow, when Thing Controlling Me fell asleep, I was able to take command again.

The honking entities surrounded my corner and nudged another frightened young woman towards me. I had never noticed her before because she had worn that massive sun hat that whole day.

It was Shula.

I was so caught off guard, I barely realized that I had control over my speech too.

 “... Shula?”

She used to work at the same modeling agency as me, and we often booked the same gigs because our skin tones were complementary. We even did a big eyeliner commercial for MAC once.

“You have to do everything … exactly as I say …”  Shula’s MAC eyeshadow now streamed down her cheeks.

She looked as sorrowful as I felt. 

“If you don’t listen  … they’ll only hurt us more.”

I stood up in my corner, eyeing the four other possessed humans. Their pupils were all dilated, probing me with intensity. 

“What? What do you mean?” I asked.

Shula’s head hung low. “This is your initiation. They want us to fight.”

“Fight?”

She stood up with reluctance and rolled back the sleeves of her oversized sweater. “We are going to have to make it look like I beat you up.”

“What? No. No no Shula. I’m not fighting you.”

“It’s not up to us. You have to do it.”

I wasn’t about to fight in some perverted boxing match. So I decided to run. I tried to bolt to my left, past Violet who was watching Shula. 

But the entity’s reflexes were too quick.

Violet seized my wrist and hurled me against the back of the room.

I slammed into a vinyl counter, breaking a nail, but miraculously, not my skull. By the time I stood up, the circle of women had surrounded me again.

“There’s no escape, Simone.” Shula curled both her fists, her sadness looked terrible and deep. “You need to fight. To show you're strong. Let's get it over with so they don't toss you.”

“Toss me?”

Shula nodded—fighting back tears.  “They've tossed bad picks before. Weaklings. So you have to put up a fight to show you're worthy. I don't want them to toss you.”

I looked at the counter behind me. It was adjoining a kitchen. 

I didn't know how long my free will would last, and I also didn’t know if I would ever have it again. I could have made many other decisions, but the mantra in my head was: *escape now or die trying.* Although their reflexes were quick, I thought maybe if I vaulted fast enough, I could grab a kitchen knife in time to properly retaliate.

So that's what I tried to do.

I flipped myself over into the kitchen. And this time, no one grabbed my wrist.

Scrambling off the linoleum floor, I shot past the fridge and industrial sink. I shot past the walk-in freezer and fryers.

But footsteps weren't far behind. By the time I reached another exit, someone grabbed my hair.

“You have to fight!” Shula screamed and dragged me to the ground. In seconds, I was pinned with a ladle against my throat.

She held a knee onto my stomach.

“That’s it. Just thrash around a little. It doesn't have to last long!”

I flipped her over and grappled her ladle, putting it on her own throat instead. Shula may have been taller, but she did not have tennis lessons with her kids.

“No! Simone! They can’t see you beat me!”

I pressed on the ladle like I was testing one of my rackets. I was single-minded in escaping, and if it meant I had to choke out my friend. Then that's what I had to do.

“You've got to stop! Plea… pl…

Her strength was fading, but I held on. It was only once her cheeks had turned blue, that I finally let go. 

GG bent over next to me with a smile. “Well done. What a fine vessel Ergic has chosen.”

My friend lay passed out on the floor. I stood with four smiling women who all smirked and patted my back.

\*\*\*

Flats of drinks were opened in the foyer. They handed me Rockstars like candy, honking and ululating in some kind of trance.

All the while, GG held on to my shoulder, not seeming to care that I was still Simone.  Her squeal-whispers felt like slugs entering my ear.

&nbsp;

*Snishak G’shak Ree*

*A new supplicant for thee*

*Snishak G’shak Gaul*

*Soon ours, one and all*

&nbsp;

During the chanting ceremony, Violet’s purple scarf was taken off her neck and then wrapped around my own.

The entities circled around me. They bowed and breathed at me, anointing me with their exhalations.

\*\*\*

GG took me to my room, and squawked to the entity inside me. I could feel it trying to wake up, playing a cerebral tug-of-war with my body.

Then GG looked me in the eyes without her sunglasses. She didn't have pupils like a normal human. She had the grid-like ommatidia of an insect.

“You are now Ergic’s tool, human. This is a high honor. Ergic is Vice-Praetor of the Old Ones.”

The Thing Controlling Me, or *Ergic*, had briefly seized control of my head and nodded.

GG put sunglasses over her eyes to speak to *me,* the real me, directly. “Cooperate with Ergic, and you will triumph. Resist, and we’ll toss you like the others. Understood?”

I didn't know what to say.

GG squeezed and held onto my cheek like I was some toy. Then she left without a word, and turned all six deadbolt locks.

\*\*\*

I wasn't certain, but I had a feeling that if I fell asleep, I would lose all control again. That Ergic would reassert himself. That’s why I was left here with more beer cans around me. They *wanted* me to doze off.

I had to stay awake.

There was a discarded laptop in the room. It was probably planted to test my allegiance or entrap me. But I didn't care. I used it to email my husband and people I trusted.

I told them I was taken hostage somewhere in California, and that needed their help. I told them my kidnappers were part of some bizarre cult.

But I didn't tell them about my possession, the preacher, or any of the crazy bodysnatching stuff. I didn't want them to think I was insane ... They would never believe me.

But hopefully you do. 

That's why I also posted this here.

If you live between Bakersfield and LA, and have ever driven past a pink, run down motel, please call the police. 

Send someone.

Save me.
