Many children grow up with a pet in their home, it seems to many parents that adopting a family dog or cat is a ritual worth participating in. Perhaps the parents of these children believe that the animal will teach them responsibility. Possibly, it is that in a decade or so, that dog’s demise will introduce your child to death in a way that your words will not be able to accomplish. Will man’s best friend be a reliable option for your kid to fall back on in case nobody likes him at school? Regardless of the reasoning, countless families across the US will adopt a dog to fill a conscious or subconscious void within their homes. What is never questioned is the dog itself, although it is essential for all these familial quirks to take shape; its entire being is only in the hands of man to mold. The dog’s purpose is only to absorb man’s presence. We provide everything for them to survive, and we receive their unconditional love.

Romeo wasn’t our family’s first choice when we started to look for a dog to accompany our current one, Chloe. I was scrolling through pictures on my mom’s old phone, smiling at possible new boxer puppies from the same breeder we had received Chloe. Boxers you may recognize as the bigger versions of a French Bulldog, with mouth-flaps, floppy ears, and a burnt, snubbed tail. This first set of puppies would get parvo, a terrible, fatal, and contagious puppy disease. When I found out, I hid my face in my parents’ bed sheets and attempted to hide myself crying. The next candidate was Romeo, an AKC registered, but self-described “accident puppy” by the Craigslister. According to him, he left two show dogs in the backseat while he ran inside to grab something; he returned minutes later to foggy windows. Smelly van.

I drove shotgun with my dad to pick him up. When we arrived, I had to wait in the car while my dad went inside to retrieve him. I remember he was cautious, “Wait in here. You don’t know what it could be like in there.” What felt like forever passed to a child who was about to meet his new puppy, I eventually peered over the passenger window as I saw my father stumble out the door and down the concrete porch, a dog barked loudly as he did. The original owners waved from inside their house. My dad walked to my side and put the puppy in my lap. He got in on his side and immediately exclaimed about how large the puppy’s parents were. He joked that he felt threatened taking the baby from his parents, but that he knew we would give him a great home to live in. Romeo had a large cone head and tons of loose cedar red skin, it was clear he had plenty of room to grow into.

As Romeo aged slightly, we realized through the vet that his testicles would not drop from an area in his stomach into where they are supposed to naturally fall. Because of this, he was required to receive essentially the same surgery that female dogs receive when they are spayed. My family attributed this to his seemingly unique personality that he would develop over the years. I noticed Romeo was different from other male boxers when I visited one of my childhood friend's house. His dog was pretty much the opposite of Romeo. He was built like a taller pit bull and was incredibly broad with a beefy build. He had tons of energy while bouncing off couches and people. This contrasted Romeo’s lanky build, as well as his calm and collected energy.

My family and I describe him as just another person when he sits on the couch. He sits on his butt and slouches his back into the cushions, his head sits slightly back, adjusting to his weight in the couch cushion. Sometimes he stares out his window, I know he longs only to protect his yard because he often stops himself and turns around less than a mile into our attempted walks. When you look into his black eyes, it feels like a window on board the ISS. It is easy to stare, and there is no potential awkwardness of natural human nature. At times, they looked back at me and I would wonder if they studied mine too. My family and I adjusted to his behavior over the years, he had very quickly inserted himself as a loved and trusted member of our family. Chloe was seven years old when she passed. It was pretty sudden, and the vets didn’t know what it was; they had asked if she had eaten any mushrooms or gotten into any antifreeze. We were unsure of both.

His personality didn’t change much after this event. He would become more confident, sometimes hitting you with his paw if you would take a break from petting him. Other times, if you were petting him from behind and paused to take a break, he would lift his head and stretch it towards you, letting his ears flop back to nearly touch the back of his neck. He started to sit by the dinner table and quietly beg for food. He had become more territorial within our gated yard, but he would still refrain from approaching people at our front door. There would be 2 groundhogs he’d dispatch from his yard, as well as be responsible for breaking a fence post when trying to bark at the mailman. To my mother’s dismay, he also began a habit of guarding his yard at night. He would begin to wake her up at very late hours of the night, anywhere from 12 to 4 AM. He won’t go outside for anyone else in the house if my mom is home, a reason to this day my mom doesn’t want to get another dog.

At times, I would have the house to myself, and when this was the case, Romeo would have no other choice but to ask me to let him out to the bathroom. When he would ask my mom, he would either hit her with his hand, whine, or a combination of both. When he would beckon me, he would simply sit in my door-frame and look at me. If I didn’t get the hint fast enough or was too enthralled in my game, he may scratch the frame of my door. Eventually, I would then walk through my small house to the back door where I would let him out into the little fenced yard. Sometimes, to get a treat presumably, he would scratch on the door to be let in, only to run back into the darkness when I'd open the door. Sometimes,  I would feel paranoid and begin to believe he was trying to lure me outside for a reason other than to play.

The reason I am writing this post is one encounter I had with him when I still lived at home. The internet is faceless, and the worst case is no one believes, but I figure sharing this in some way is better than keeping quiet; maybe someone has had a similar occurrence. I sat there playing Destiny 2 in the middle of a raid with some friends, but I was home alone. He sat in my door frame, I don’t know how long he sat there before I turned to my left and saw him. At first, I tried to ignore him; after all, I had multiple people depending on me in this game, and he could wait a minute, that was if he even needed something. Sometimes, he would whine and complain to be let out, only to lead me to the door and then refuse to go outside. It was an extremely frustrating habit of his. I continued playing my game, and after a few minutes of him staring, he began to whine and scratch at the door. Usually, when he started this, he would not stop until I got up. I arose from my chair and followed him as he turned and started walking towards the direction of my back door.

I opened the door for him, and thankfully he started to walk outside. As he passed me, he looked up at me as if to blankly say thank you and proceeded to walk down the concrete stairs. I closed the door and returned to my game. It was maybe an hour that passed before I remembered I had let him out. As usual, my brain thought of the worst-case scenario first. Did someone leave the gate open by accident and let him out of our yard into the neighborhood? I left my chair again and went to see what could have happened. What followed was a very brief encounter, which it’s a reality I still question to this day. I stood in the outside door frame, the cold air hit my face while I surveyed the yard for Romeo. I felt immediate defeat as he did not come to the door, and even more so when I did not hear his collar jingle at the sound of his favorite treat bag. My mind fell silent when I turned to my left and saw a faint light from under the door to my yard’s shed. Surely, someone had left it on earlier, and maybe Romeo had snuck his way in.

I had always felt my neighborhood to be safe, but in that instant, I realized how there were no real security measures that would prevent some hypothetical crackhead from walking right into my shed and lighting up. How ridiculous, I pulled my big boy pants up and walked the short distance to the shed door. The rusty metal handle morphed with my fingers and palm as I pushed in. I never stepped up into the frame; what stood 8 feet away from me was Romeo. His body now upwards, a bipedal creature stared at me with the same expression Romeo did an hour ago. His knees bent back further than before, and tendons that previously would have prevented him from standing straight fell loose at the back of his legs. His spine still visibly curved his body forward, unbalanced. I made no noise as did he, we stared for what felt like an eternity. He slowly approached me, and as he progressed, I expected his form to limp, but it did not. His gait contained a smooth certainty, I could describe it only in another human. Slight bits of drool fell from his black flaps, his eyes felt like encroaching black holes as he stepped towards me. His incapable paw reached out and softly contacted the shed door; he gently pushed it closed. I stared back, still and quietly, at the flaking paint on the old wooden door.

I would walk back inside, tell my friends I wasn’t feeling well, and lie down. When I awoke the next day, I went to look for Romeo. What happened the night before I had convinced myself was a dream. Why would it be anything else? Romeo was still outside when I found him. I cautiously glared through the glass on my back door. He stared coldly up at me from the stairs. I spent the next few years of my life watching out for Romeo, he had never given me a reason to fear him. I no longer wondered if his eyes looked back at me with wonder. I moved out of my parents’ house at 18, I don’t believe anyone in my life would believe this; there is no reason for them to. Romeo never seemed to mean any harm. What would I gain from exposing him? He is still happily taken care of by my parents to this day.
