  
A while ago the weird girl in class threw a birthday party, she invited the entire class but as far as I knew no one was planning on going. My mom found out and guilted me into going saying stuff like no one showing up to your birthday party is how serial killers are made. I couldn’t convince any of my friends to go so I ended up going alone. Her parents were beyond happy to have me there, they kept filling my plate with snacks and offering me more drinks, she however, seemed almost angry at me for showing up, she kept shooting me dirty looks and didn’t say a single word. She hadn’t dressed up at all and just looked like she always did, messy ponytail, oversized sweatshirt, and jeans, I would think she’d at least brush her hair for her own birthday party!  
  
Needless to say I was very uncomfortable and couldn’t wait till I’m back home. When I finally was my mom asked me how it went and I told her how awkward it was and said that it always seemed pathetic how she never had any friends but now I think maybe she never wanted them. My mom said she’s proud of me for going and that everyone wants friends even if they’re too proud to admit it.  
  
The next day at school was fairly normal but the weird girl kept angrily staring at me the whole time. I ignored her but she kept doing it all week, I finally decided to talk to her and ask if I offended her somehow. She stared me down and recited the whole conversation I had with my mom after her party word for word! I was shocked! She couldn’t have heard it and there is no way my mom would tell hers that I called her daughter pathetic and even if she did she wouldn’t recite it word for word! I kept gaping at her not sure what to reply and just said “sorry” she then went on to recite a conversation I had with my friend who asked me about the party, she recited it word for word, without missing a beat, it was like listening to a recording except it was in her voice, I panicked and started yelling at her to leave me alone and to stop spying on me and stormed out. After that she would come to me every day and recite a random conversation, I had the day before even if it wasn’t about her, each conversation with a different person, at a different location so my only conclusion was that they she bugged me!  
  
I threw out all my clothes and bought new ones but it didn’t work. I thought she could’ve hidden something in my hair so I got a lice comb and used it on my hair for hours to the point my scalp started burning from the frequent rough brushing. But surly, the next day in school she recited my conversation with a drive thru employee! , I tried to see if spy implants are a thing but I couldn’t find anything online other than Elon Musk’s stupid experiment and a bunch of theories  
  
How is she doing this, can anyone PLEASE HELP?!
