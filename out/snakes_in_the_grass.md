She heard us. 

In the blackness of every night, as she would slowly drift off into the tranquil release of slumber, she heard us. Millions of thin black, twisted legs, working their way along the interior of her walls. She had an exterminator come after the first few nights of detecting such activity, and although she was sure that the man would have been glad to overcharge her for his services, he found nothing to work with. Absolutely no trace of her night-time tormentors. Oh, how she almost wished he would have run a game on her and done something, anything to ease her mind for at least one night. 

But alas, the pest professional found not a sign of life in her walls. 

Our walls. 

On any other day this diagnosis would have been a gift from the gods to her. You see, she was terribly petrified of bugs. Her primitive ancestors must have been, as well, because she had some sort of sixth sense when it came to spotting creepy-crawlers or fluttering frights. She was always aware of our existence, aware we were watching her - her pupils forever alarmed by some unusual black or brown blob moving just past the corner of her eye. Perhaps a useful skill for some; yet, it did nothing to save her, in the end. You see, her relationship with insects is quite complex, she’d say. As a lover and defender of all animals, even vermin and pests had a respected place in her mind. Hm, go figure. When she lived with her family, her plan of action in defense of a pest was simply to scream bloody murder until one of her brothers arrived with a cup and a plate, releasing the insect back into the wild (that is, her asphalt suburban streets.) However, as if it was nothing more than an inconvenience, the offenders always crept their way back into her sanctuary - into her head, learning her. I suppose she never did discover what to do with snakes in her grass. 



Well, now that she lived on her own, she never could muster the gall to manage an insect in her space. When she’d detect a critter, which was quite frequently, it would usually surmise first with a draining panic attack, the she’d be left with no choice but to resort to her nature-loving ways and try to forget her company. But, as our presence grew, her mental strength diminished. And this made it quite easy to finally nestle our way in.  

You see, of course that college drop-out of an exterminator never would have detected us. Even if he had degrees from the top Ivy Leagues of bug extermination, we were simply not residing in his jurisdiction. She’d have better luck with a neurologist and a MRI. 

But we never did leave her with much time, or brain-power. 

The soft sounds of endless rustling during the midnight hours were never easy to ignore, but our minuscule, faint footsteps evolved. The gnawing, and pitter-patter began echoing through out her head, bouncing of the walls within her skull. Sleep became a distant memory. Towards the end, the headaches were all she could think of. Of course, all that she known was going into our research. You see, this is her computer. These are her hands that are typing on her keyboard. But it is us in the control room.
