I installed a doorbell camera two weeks ago. Just a cheap one from Amazon. I figured it’d be good for catching porch pirates, keeping an eye on things when I was away. I live alone in a quiet neighborhood. Nothing ever happens here. Or at least, that’s what I used to think.

The first alert came at **1:47 AM**.

**Motion detected at front door.**

I opened the app, expecting to see a stray cat, maybe a passing car. But the feed was empty. My porch. My driveway. The dim glow of the streetlight. Nothing. Probably a bug triggering the sensor, I thought. I went back to sleep.

The next night, it happened again.

**3:12 AM.**  
**Motion detected at front door.**

Again, I checked. Again, the porch was empty. But something felt… off. The shadows looked deeper. The streetlight’s glow seemed weaker, like it was struggling against something I couldn’t see. Then I made a mistake.

I checked the **saved footage**.

For just **a single frame**, there was… something. A **shape**. A **tall figure**, standing **perfectly still**, just beyond the camera’s field of view. Right at the edge of the street.

It wasn’t moving. It wasn’t walking past. It was **watching**. I told myself it was a glitch. A trick of the light. I deleted the footage and went back to bed, ignoring the unease curdling in my stomach.

The next night, it happened again. And again.

Every night. **1:47 AM. 3:12 AM. 4:56 AM.** Always just **one frame**. And each time, the figure was **closer**.

I Call the Police. They Find Nothing.

After a week of this, I finally called the cops. The officer checked the footage, frowning. “Could be a camera error,” he said. “Or a prank. We’ll patrol the area tonight.” He walked around with a flashlight, scanning my yard, even shining it down the street.

Nothing.

Still, I felt a little safer knowing someone would be keeping an eye out. That night, I actually managed to fall asleep. Until **the next alert came in.**

**4:03 AM.**  
**Motion detected at front door.**

I opened the app, dreading what I’d see. This time, the figure was **standing at the foot of my driveway**. And now, I could see its face. Or rather… I could see where its **face should be**. There were **features**, but they were **wrong**—too smooth, too symmetrical, like a mannequin that had almost—but not quite—been shaped into something human. I slammed my phone down, my hands shaking. I called the cops again. They arrived in minutes. Checked the area. Checked the footage.

And found **nothing**.

But then, as one officer stepped onto my porch, he hesitated.

“…Did you touch your doorknob recently?” I frowned. “No.” He pointed. The knob was **wet**. Like someone had **gripped it**. Held it. For a long time. I didn’t sleep at all that night.

**It Knows I’m Watching.**

The next day, I took off work. Stayed inside, blinds closed. Kept checking the footage. Nothing happened all day. Then, at exactly midnight, I got another alert.

I opened the app—

**The camera feed was black.**

Not offline. **Just black.** Like something was covering the lens. My stomach clenched. I grabbed the nearest kitchen knife, stepping slowly toward the front door.

Then—

**A knock.**

Soft. Deliberate. I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

Then—

**Another knock.**

I checked my phone again. The feed was still black. But the microphone was working. I tapped the audio button and whispered: **“Who’s there?”**

Silence.

Then, in the quietest voice I have ever heard— **“I know you see me.”** I dropped the phone. My hands were ice-cold. My pulse pounded in my ears. For the next six hours, I sat on the floor, knife in hand, waiting for the sun to rise.

The Camera Won’t Turn Off.

Morning came. I checked the footage again, half-expecting to see nothing, half-dreading what I might find. At first, everything looked normal. Then I checked the motion log.

There was **a new timestamp**.

**3:47 AM.**

But instead of saying **“Motion detected at front door,”** it just said:

**“Face recognized.”**

My blood turned to ice. I don’t have **facial recognition enabled**. My breath hitched. Hands shaking, I tapped the notification, trying to open the image. The app glitched. Froze. The screen flickered.

Then—just for a split second—it **flashed an image**.

Not of my porch.

Not of the street.

**Of me.**

**Asleep in bed.**

I threw the phone across the room. Heart hammering, I ran to the front door, yanked the camera off its mount, unplugged it. The app stayed open. The feed stayed **live**. Even with the camera **off**, it was still recording. I tried deleting the app. It wouldn’t let me. I tried resetting my phone. The app wouldn’t close. I tried turning off my WiFi. The feed stayed on.

And just now—

**As I’m typing this—**

I got another alert.

**Motion detected.**

But this time, it’s not at the front door.

This time—

**It’s inside the house.**
