This is a difficult story to share. I have tried for so long to put it out of my memory. Still, it was always waiting for quiet moments of reflection or the dark, ethereal moments before drifting off to sleep. I can no longer stay silent, and the others involved either can’t or won’t talk about it, so I came here to be heard.

Back when I was 12 years old, I was part of a group of five friends. There was me, Sara, Kyle, Jamal, and Liz. Most days after school, the five of us would hang out, either at one of our houses or just wandering around the small town we called home. Every now and then, some other kids would join us. It was one of those days when it happened. Jack, a kid no one really liked, decided to tag along as we wandered. We would have said no, but his mom was friends with Liz’s. We had made our way to one of the local parks when Jack said the words that now haunt me. “Bet you guys are too chicken to check out the Green House.” The Green House was just on the edge of the park, and everyone in town knew to stay away from it. The house itself wasn’t actually green; it was called that because of how overgrown it was. All four walls were being strangled by ivy, with only the occasional bare spot showing the faded blue underneath. The place had been abandoned for as long as we kids could remember, and our parents had always told us to stay away; in hindsight, we should have listened to them.

“No way am I doing that, my dad would kill me,” Sara replied, sneering, if I remember correctly.

Before leaving, Jack called back after her, “Good riddance, after all, only babies are afraid of ghosts.”

“Well, I’m not afraid of anything.” Kyle shot back, “Right, Jamal?” he added, clasping his hand onto his best friend's shoulder. “Oh, uh, right,” Jamal stammered. Jamal was by far the biggest kid in our group, almost the size of Kyle and me put together, but despite that, he was also the easiest to scare. Had Kyle not pushed him, he definitely would have gone home.

“Someone has to watch you dummies, so I guess I’m in too.” Liz said.

“That leaves one then, are you a man or not?” Jack said while making faces at me.

Part of me wishes I had left then and there, but I had too much misplaced pride, and to be honest, I doubt it would have changed much in the end, after all the others had already made their decisions. 

Things were already off to a bad start just going through the backyard. Jack managed to trip on a rock, and Liz spooked a snake. Little did we know that much worse was to come. The back door was only partially covered with plants, and once we pulled them off, we found out the door was unlocked. It led into a mold-filled room that had once been a kitchen. The place smelled terrible, but our curiosity was stronger than our disgust, and we poked around the room, checking cabinets and whatnot. Most were empty, and those that weren't held a few rusted pots at best. Those discarded objects didn’t hold our attention for long, so we moved on to the living room. It smelled somewhat better than the kitchen and was empty besides a lonely old couch against one wall. More interesting than the room itself were the four doors that branched off from it. One was just the front door and was locked, but the other three were open. The first of the open doors led to a tiny bathroom, only one of us could fit in there at a time, and it smelled almost as bad as the kitchen. Oddly, this room had a lot left in it, soap and toilet paper to name a few, but what was most interesting was the cracked mirror looking onto the living room. Standing as we were, the crack divided our group in two. 

Another door descended into darkness, and despite the earlier bravado, even Jack wasn't willing to go down there. That left just one final door, the one we never should have stepped through. Yet we did, we passed the threshold into a new, worse stage of life (for some of us at least). Up that flight of stairs were several doors, but we only managed to open one. It led into a mostly empty bedroom, with a closed box on the floor by the far window. All of us were curious as to what was inside. Jack and Kyle just happened to be the first to walk in. The next parts are by far the hardest to remember; it was all a blur.

There was a great groaning noise followed by a crash, then another from further away. I blinked, and where the two boys had been standing was now a gaping hole in the floor, its jagged edges like the teeth of a massive beast. The rest of us rushed downstairs only to see that the bathroom had been swallowed by another hole; our friends could only be in one place. 

Jamal, showing unusual bravery, retrieved a flashlight from his pocket. “We have to help Kyle, c'mon, hurry”. He stammered while visibly shaking. We slowly descended the stairs, the flashlight cutting a narrow beam through the oppressive darkness.  The basement, in contrast to the rest of the house, was filled with items and dust. Off to one side, the beam found a red puddle, followed by two small shapes mangled in ways I’m not willing to describe. There was no helping Kyle or Jack; the last chance was at that doorway upstairs.

From there, my memory fades. We must have gone to our parents and the police because there was an investigation, but the next thing I remember was two weeks later. Jamal, Liz, Sarah, and I went back to the Green House at night. We were going to do a memorial of sorts, though we definitely weren't going to go inside. (We couldn’t anyway since the police had boarded the place up.) From afar, everything was normal, but once we reached the middle of the backyard, we realized something was off. The boarded-up door was now open, and two small figures dripping a glowing red substance were standing inside, beckoning us in. We ran and didn't look back.
