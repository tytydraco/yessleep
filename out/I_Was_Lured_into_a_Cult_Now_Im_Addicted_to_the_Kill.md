I live in this small town, just your typical suburbia with cozy houses and friendly neighbours. It's the kind of place where everyone knows everyone and where you can't walk down the street without getting a wave or a hello. In our house, it's me, my parents, and my two older brothers. We're pretty close-knit, always looking out for each other. Our Mom and Dad spoil us rotten, making sure we have everything we need and more.

At the time, my 16th birthday was coming up, and let me tell you, it's a big deal in our town. There's this tradition where the whole family gets together, along with some folks from the community, to celebrate. It's a real bash, with tons of food, laughter, and maybe a little too much cake. But the thing I was most excited about, was the hunt. See, in our town, when you turn 16, you get to go on this big hunting trip with the older folks. It's kind of a rite of passage, something my brothers had already gone through. They've always been my heroes, coming back from their hunts with these crazy stories of adventure. I've been looking forward to this day for as long as I can remember. I couldn’t wait to finally join my brothers out there in the woods, proving I've got what it takes to protect and provide for the community.

On the day of my birthday, I threw on the red dress I had picked out the night before and practically flew downstairs, eager to dive into a mountain of presents. As the day unfolded, guests began to show up one after the other, each greeting me with hugs and a single Kiss on the forehead. At first it was a little strange and I couldn't help but notice how everyone seemed to linger a little too long, their smiles stretched a tad too wide. But I brushed it off and told myself it was just the excitement of the day. After all, in our town, turning sixteen was a big deal. The rest of the day was everything I could've asked for. Presents were unwrapped, cake was devoured, and laughter echoed off the walls.

But as the day turned into evening, it was time for the hunt. Gathering with the other birthday guests and the elders of the community, I felt a surge of excitement and nervous energy coursing through my veins. This was it, my chance to prove myself, to join the ranks of the hunters and make my family proud.  
My father stepped forward, handing me the family rifle, a relic passed down through generations, wielded by both of my brothers on their own first hunts. My heart pounded with anticipation knowing it was my turn to use it for something important. With the rifle in my hands, I followed the older folks into the woods, feeling a mix of nerves and excitement.

I wondered what we might find: a deer, a boar, maybe even a wolf. Suddenly, a noise erupted from the underbrush, a sound that sent a shiver down my spine. Without hesitation, I raised the rifle, my fingers trembling against the cold metal. A figure burst from the shadows. In a panic, I pulled the trigger and the creature let out a piercing shriek, its cries echoing through the trees before falling silent and collapsing to the ground. As we approached, horror clawed at my throat, almost threatening to suffocate me. The figure lay motionless before us, its naked form battered and bruised, its eyes red-rimmed as if it had been crying for an eternity. I realized it wasn't an animal. It was a person! Naked and with red, tear-filled eyes. I felt sick to my stomach at the realization of what I had done. But to my astonishment, the other hunters showed no sign of remorse or horror. Instead, they congratulated me with nods of approval and words of praise, as if this were nothing more than a routine occurrence. I stood frozen in disbelief, unable to comprehend the cruelty of our actions.

As we carried the lifeless body back, I fought back tears, wishing desperately that I could turn back time. I knew deep down that what we had done was terribly wrong, and I wanted nothing more than to run away from it all. But fear held me in its grip, paralyzing me, rendering me incapable of speaking out or taking action. When we returned home, one of the elders spoke words that chilled me to the bone. "She has brought our next sacrifice, let us drink to this!" And to my horror, everyone cheered, as if what we had done was something to be celebrated. They laid the body on the table, and I watched in numb terror as they began to cut it open.

The stench of blood filled the air, mingling with the sickly-sweet scent of decay. My stomach churned. Then, they filled a cup with the person's blood, placing it in the middle of the room alongside flickering candles. The sight made my blood run cold, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. This was no ordinary celebration. It was something far more sinister, something that I wanted no part of. The chanting grew louder, filling the air with an eerie intensity that made my skin crawl. Unable to bear it any longer, I fled up the stairs, seeking refuge in the solitude of my room. But even there, I could still hear the haunting echoes of the ritual below.

It wasn't long before Mateo, my eldest brother, appeared at my door to seemingly check up on me. "The first hunt is always the hardest," he said softly, indicating he himself had done this multiple times. I told him I was running away, but he stopped me, his grip firm as he blocked my path. "I can't let you do that," he said.

Before I knew it, I found myself locked in the basement. Time seemed to lose all meaning down there, the days blending together. Every so often, a sacrifice would be brought down, their screams and pleas for mercy echoing off the cold stone walls. Then, my parents presented me with a choice: either I killed one of the sacrifices myself, or they would take one of my friends from school instead. I had no other option but to do as they asked, with the weight of each life I took crushing me a little more.

As time went on, the methods grew more brutal, more grotesque. Chainsaws, baseball bats, whatever was at hand became instruments of torture and death. But eventually, something inside me broke. The screams faded into background noise, the cries for help becoming little more than whispers in the darkness. I became numb to the horror unfolding before me. And then, just when I thought I couldn't bear it any longer, my parents offered me a deal. If I promised to behave and go on the next hunt, they would let me out of the basement.

As the basement door swung open, I emerged into the dim hallway. Instead of making a run for it, I turned to my mother with just one question that had been burning in my mind since the nightmare began: "Why?" Her eyes softened as she explained the cult's twisted beliefs, how they believed in an ancient deity that demanded sacrifices to grant power and protection to its followers. After she finished, I nodded and retreated to my room. Despite the horror and disgust, I should have felt, I couldn't deny the strange thrill that coursed through me at the thought of the next hunt. The twisted reasoning behind our actions didn't bother me as much as it should have. In fact, it excited me. The torturous screams that once haunted my nightmares now seemed almost like music to my ears.

It was sick, I knew, but I couldn't help but feel a rush of adrenaline at the thought of the hunt. It was like a twisted game, and I was eager to play my part. With a sense of grim determination, I packed a bag with the essentials: duct tape, rope, an axe. I was ready for whatever the hunt might bring.

I am currently lying in bed. I can’t seem to shake off this urge to Kill once more. This time with my own free will. Besides, I wouldn’t be able to go back to my old life either way. The next hunt is tomorrow. I am ready to race my brothers for the first kill of the night, to prove myself once and for all as a true member of the hunt.
