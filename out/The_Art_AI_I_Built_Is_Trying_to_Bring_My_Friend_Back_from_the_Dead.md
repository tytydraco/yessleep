The Breathing

The sound hasn’t stopped.

It’s soft, steady, right against my ear—warm exhalations brushing the tiny hairs on the back of my neck.

I don’t dare move.

Because if I move, I’ll have to admit he’s really there.

I told myself last night that I imagined it. That the buzzing webcam light, the phantom breaths, the sudden chill in my room—those were tricks of exhaustion.

But when I woke this morning, the indentation was still in the chair beside my bed. As if someone had sat there all night.

Watching me.

I tried to leave the apartment. Grabbed my keys, shoved on a hoodie. But when I opened the front door, something invisible pressed it shut from the other side.

Hard.

No matter how much I pushed, it wouldn’t budge.

Then—fingers. Ice-cold. Sliding across the back of my hand still gripping the doorknob.

I yanked away, stumbled backward. The door swung open freely.

The hallway was empty.

But I know what I felt.

Max had touched me.


I avoided my laptop all day. No screens. No mirrors. I even pulled the batteries from my phone and shoved it in a drawer.

But it didn’t matter.

When I glanced at the microwave door while making coffee, his face stared back at me in the reflection.

When I washed my hands in the bathroom, his grin spread across the surface of the water before rippling away.

When I tried to nap on the couch, I woke up to my TV flickering on by itself.

And there he was, sitting on my couch in the static.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I screamed. Threw a glass at the screen. The TV shattered, sparks flying.

But even as the screen went dark, the static face lingered, burned into the shards.

Smiling.


I found myself going through old things. Boxes in the closet I hadn’t opened since Max died.

Photos. Letters. The stupid comic we drew in middle school about two superheroes who couldn’t stop arguing.

Buried under it all was his old notebook. A journal he carried everywhere.

Most of it was filled with random doodles and inside jokes. But near the end—

The handwriting changed.

Shaky. Erratic.

One page said:

“Sometimes I dream I’m inside the walls. Watching you. Waiting for you to notice.”

Another:

“If I ever die, don’t forget me. Because if you forget, I’ll have to remind you.”

The last page wasn’t finished. Just three words, jagged and carved deep into the paper like he was pressing down too hard:

“LET ME IN.”


Tonight, it got worse.

I woke to a noise. A soft creak from the corner of the room.

I thought it was the house settling. Until I noticed the air smelled wrong—like damp earth and rotting leaves.

And then I saw it.

A shadow, darker than the rest of the dark, hunched in the corner.

At first it was shapeless. But slowly, it stretched upward, limbs unfolding, head tilting.

And then—features.

Max’s grin.

Max’s eyes.

He didn’t step forward. Didn’t move closer. Just stood there, impossibly tall, smile splitting his face in half.

And whispered my name.

Not in my ears. Not in my head.

Everywhere.

The walls, the floor, the ceiling—they all breathed it together:

“Come closer.”


I don’t know what time it is now. I’ve been hiding in my room with the lights on, writing this as fast as I can.

But just a few minutes ago, I heard it.

Three knocks on my window.

I live on the third floor.

I told myself not to look. I told myself to keep typing.

But curiosity won.

I turned.

And there he was.

Max.

Clinging to the glass from the outside, fingers twisted against the pane, smile stretched wider than ever. His eyes were pale and glassy, like something long dead and waterlogged.

And then, in foggy letters written across the inside of the glass, where I hadn’t touched it—

“Almost there.”

The Window

The glass creaked.

Max’s fingers scraped down the window, leaving streaks of something dark and wet. His grin stretched wider than the frame could contain, teeth pressing against the glass as if it would shatter from the pressure.

I staggered back. “You’re not real.”

His lips moved, though the words echoed inside my skull instead of outside it.

“You asked for me.”

“No—” My voice cracked. “I didn’t!”

“You typed it. You opened the door. I was waiting.”

The glass bulged inward, warping, trembling. I bolted for the door, but when I grabbed the knob—ice-cold fingers were already there.

I froze.

Max was inside.


I stumbled backward as the lights flickered. The room stretched wrong, corners bending in on themselves.

And Max stepped into the glow.

His face wasn’t like I remembered. It was as though someone had stretched his features over a frame too large, skin pulled taut, mouth splitting ear to ear. His eyes were hollow but burning, dark pits that swallowed the light.

“Why are you here?” I whispered.

He tilted his head. “Because you never said goodbye.”

My throat closed. He was right—I hadn’t. At the funeral, I couldn’t bring myself to speak. Couldn’t face the casket. I left early, walked home in silence.

And he’d followed me.


“I can’t stay,” I said. “You’re dead. You’re not supposed to be here.”

Max’s grin faltered. For the first time, his face softened, almost human.

“Then let me in,” he said gently. “One last time. Just for a little while. You owe me that.”

I shook my head. “If I let you in, I won’t come back out.”

His grin snapped back into place. “Exactly.”


He lunged.

Cold hands wrapped around my face, pressing hard, forcing my eyes open. The world warped. My walls peeled away, my ceiling stretched upward. I was somewhere else—surrounded by screens, thousands of them, all flashing the same image:

Me.

Every screen showed me at different moments of my life. Laughing with Max. Crying alone. Staring at a coffin. Typing at my desk.

And in every single frame, Max was there.

Standing just behind me.

Watching.

The images flickered faster, until they blurred, until I couldn’t tell which version of myself was real anymore.

Then I felt it—his breath, hot and rancid, right against my ear.

“This is forever now.”

I woke up in my bed.

Morning sunlight spilling across the sheets. My laptop closed. My phone silent.

For a moment, I thought I’d dreamed it all.

But then I noticed the smell. Damp earth. Rotting leaves.

And my phone buzzed.

One new notification.

From Max.

Not the AI. Not a program.

From my contacts list.

I hadn’t saved his number since the accident. I couldn’t even bring myself to look at it. But there it was.

Message:

“Thanks for letting me in. :)”

My chest went ice-cold. Hands shaking, I clicked my front camera to check my reflection.

And froze.

Because the face staring back at me wasn’t mine.

It was his.

Max.

Smiling through my skin.


I don’t know if I’m writing this anymore.

Or if Max is.

But if you’re reading this—if you’ve made it to the end—don’t ever train an AI alone.

Don’t look too long at the faces in your photos.

And whatever you do, don’t forget your dead.

Because they’ll find a way back.

And when they do—

They won’t leave.
