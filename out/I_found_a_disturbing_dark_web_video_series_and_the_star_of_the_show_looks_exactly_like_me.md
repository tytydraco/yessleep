This happened almost a month ago, but it's only as of today that I had the wherewithal to start writing it all down. I want to share what happened to me as part vent and part precautionary tale, and so I hope you understand why I'm keeping the details vague. 

I'm 21F and about to graduate college. Since sophomore year, I've worked part-time as a barista at a coffee shop. Up until a few weeks ago, it was a great gig. I was well paid, I got free pastries, and many of my coworkers became close friends of mine. One of said coworkers is relevant to this story, and to protect her privacy, I'll refer to her as "Lydia" henceforth. 

Every once in a while, I would get hit on by a patron, but it never escalated beyond a few sometimes creepy comments. I had previously never felt unsafe at my workplace, especially with all of my coworkers and regulars around. That changed about a month ago, when this whole ordeal began. It was around 4 in the afternoon, a pretty quiet time for the cafe, and I was refilling the pastry display. All of a sudden, Lydia comes up to me and says, "Hey, that guy at Table 10 has been staring at you for a really long time. Do you two know each other?"

I looked at the corner table and instantly saw the patron in question. He wasn't a regular and he was a lot older than our usual clientele, probably in his late fifties. He had large, light blue eyes and thick, worm-like lips. I expected him to look away after I spotted him, or maybe to give me a suggestive wink and smile. The patron did neither. Not only did he continue staring at me, but he did so with an expression of pure shock on his face. He looked as though he'd seen a ghost. After an awkward staring contest, he rose from his seat and approached the counter. 

Before I could do my usual spiel—"How was the drink, sir? Can I help you out with anything else today?"—the man said, "Angelica?" 

"That's not my name, sorry." 

"Oh, right. It's only a stage name, then?" His voice was soft and high-pitched, as if atrophied. I had no clue what he was talking about and told him as much, albeit in more polite terms. What followed was a brief but frustrating conversation; the man, seemingly convinced that I was someone else, kept asking me about a video series that he'd seen me in. Specifically, he was interested in commissioning me for a video. By the way he danced around the exact content of said videos, I had a feeling that he was alluding to pornography. 

At one point, he mentioned that name of what I presumed to be the platform he was watching these videos on. I obviously won't give the exact name here, but for the purposes of this account, I'll pseudonymize it as "Doves". 

After some more back and forth, I was starting to think that the guy wasn't completely alright in the head. It would explain his insistence and his generally strange demeanor. However, just as I was about to ask him to leave, the man suddenly went quiet, sighing as though collecting himself. After a moment, he gave me a wink. I remember his eyelids audibly clicking as they opened and shut. 

"You don't have to be nervous," he told me. "I'm a fan of yours. Look." He then took his phone out of his pocket, spent a minute searching for something, and then held the phone out to me. I don't know what got into me exactly—sheer curiosity, I guess—but I took the phone from his hands to look at the image he'd pulled up. 

On the greasy screen was a photo of a young woman in an empty white room. The lighting was harsh and flat, lending an uncanny effect to an already bizarre composition. The woman stood close enough to the camera that you could only see her body from the waist up. She held her arm out towards the camera, showing off what seemed to be a puncture wound on her forearm. There was a large bruise encircling the area, and the wound itself was clearly infected, caked with old blood and pus. I looked up from the arm to her face, and despite the strange lighting, I was shocked by how much it looked like my own. She had my eye color and shape, my nose, my jaw, even my freckles. I dropped the phone onto the counter with a gasp and the man scrambled to pick it up. 

"What the fuck is that? Where did you get this photo!?" I shouted, losing all pretense of nonchalance. The cafe went quiet, customers looking over at us and a few of my coworkers stepping closer to me. Seeing this, the man scowled and began muttering under his breath. I only caught a few words: "uppity bitch" and "good money" among them. He exited the shop in a huff, leaving an untouched cup of coffee on the corner table. 

After he left, I took 15 in the break room to compose myself. The photograph of the woman burned in my mind's eye. This "Angelica" seriously could have been my long-lost identical twin. I pulled out my phone and did a preliminary search for "Doves", the website (at least I assumed it was a website) that the man had mentioned, but I saw nothing that looked like a content sharing platform. I resolved to do a more thorough investigation once I returned home and had access to a computer. I made it through the rest of my evening without further incident. 

I worked the closing shift that day: 2 to 10 at night. When at last my coworkers and I finished all of our closing tasks, I put on my coat and stepped out of the building. The moment I felt the cold air on my face, the thought of walking two blocks to my car made me sick with fear. Lydia walked me to my car, which I greatly appreciated. She's a good head shorter than me, but she carries, so I felt a hell of a lot safer braving the dark beside her.  When I reached my car, I checked the trunk and backseat. After assuring myself that there was no-one waiting for me inside, I bid my friend goodnight and we parted ways. 

I had plenty of time to reflect during my thirty minute drive home. Embarrassing as it is to admit, I was a former pageant kid. I competed for most of my childhood, at the behest of my former beauty-queen mother. As a teenager, my mom tried to get me into modelling. It never went anywhere, but the amount of times my parents made me sit for digitals gave me some long-term scopophobia. To this day, I don't have any public social media as a result. I think anyone would be disturbed if a stranger confronted them in the way my customer did me, but my background made the experience impossible to shrug off. I needed to figure out who the hell this "Angelica" woman was, even if I knew I might not like what I discovered. 

I got back to my apartment at around 10:30 at night and the first thing I did was grab a drink, hoping it would soothe my anxiety. Unfortunately, the alcohol seemed to have the complete opposite effect. Never before had I regretted living alone so much. The fact that I lived on the first floor of the apartment building, usually a great convenience, also seemed at that moment to be a point of vulnerability. I checked that all of my doors and windows were locked before settling into my desk to begin my research. 

When checking the lock on my bedroom window, I stole a glance outside at the street. My apartment building has no attached parking garage, so the streets outside are lined with cars at all hours of the day and night. I've become familiar with my neighbors cars to the point where I can recognize when one of them is missing. It's for this reason that I picked up on the unfamiliar  Cherokee XJ across the street. The dark blue car, which I initially mistook for my neighbor's Isuzu Trooper, blended in well with its surroundings despite being an unusual model. I don't think I would've noticed it at all had the events of the day not left me so paranoid. I didn't see anyone inside, and it wasn't as though there was anything I could do about it, so I just closed my shutters and focused on the task at hand. 

At 10:45, I sat down at my desk with nothing but a woman's name and what I believed to be the name of a website. For a full hour, I poked around on the web to no avail. I started off with searches like "Angelica arm puncture wound video" and "Angelica arm white room doves" and then tried more detailed queries. I searched around increasingly obscure forums dedicated to all manner of topics from body horror art to grotesque auto-portraiture photography. Several drinks later, it occurred to me that I might be conducting my investigation in the wrong place—more specifically, on the wrong layer of the web. I hadn't wanted to confront the notion previously, but there was a chance that Angelica was producing some kind of self-harm fetish content, and if that were the case, I wasn't sure how much I'd find about her content on the surface web. 

Since I don't want anyone reading this to go on to search for the website, I'm not going to get into the details of my search. I will say, though, that once I got onto Dread, it wasn't nearly as hard to find as I thought. By midnight, I had found what I was looking for. 

The website's homepage was minimalistic—white text on a pure black background. It had a heading, "**DOV3S**", and a subheading, "**3 friends creating exclusive content with love**." Beneath were three names that let me know I was in the right place:

**> angelica** 

**> mary**

**> adam**

I steeled myself and clicked on "angelica". This portion of the site was a single, sprawling page that seemed to scroll for miles. Up at the top was a message, supposedly written by the woman herself: 

**angelica. 8teen. durable. i <3 my fans!!**

**no longer accepting commissions.**

**price varies on a per-video, per-photoset basis.**

**click title for duration/thumbnail/price info**

**!!! VIDEOS BEFORE 1/14/23 DO NOT HAVE AUDIO !!!**

**!!! NO REFUNDS !!!** 

Beneath the introductory text was a subheading that read "free sample", and beneath that was an embedded video, two minutes in duration. 

I pressed play. The video buffered for a long while, then began. It faded from black into a familiar shot. In the same white room I'd seen in the customer's picture, there she stood. She—"Angelica"—looked *awful*, far worse that she'd looked in the photograph. Her jaw clenched and unclenched strangely and her eyes were wide and darting, like a wild animal's. There was a giant, half-healed gash in her cheek and her left arm was covered in bandages, perhaps suggesting that this video was filmed after the customer's photo was taken.   

The woman wearing my face gave the camera an uncertain smile. She held up a hand, showing her palm, then turning it around to show the back. She then slowly set her hand palm-down on a small wooden table below her. The camera tilted downwards, following her hand in such a way that indicated another person was filming with a handheld. The camera lingered on her hand for a moment. I heard someone inhale. And then, a hammer came down on the woman's hand. 

After the blow, the camera jerked back up to her face. She started making this pained moaning sound. Her mouth twisted and I saw tears welling up in her eyes. The camera moved back down to her hand, where a deep bruise was already welling up under her skin. I paused the video here to scroll down, reading through the myriad of titles listed beneath it. The most recent link was called "blunt force 33", followed by "blunt force 32", "puncture 12".

 "eye infection". 

"needles under nails". 

I felt dizzy. I had to stand up and pace around the room to keep from puking my guts out. Maybe I should've stopped there, but for whatever reason, I felt like I had some responsibility to finish. I pressed play once more. 

Down again came the hammer, this time landing atop the knuckle of her forefinger with a *crack*. Four more blows rained down on the hand, one for each knuckle. By the end, the sounds coming from the woman didn't seem entirely human. It didn't sound like me, but it was hard to tell. I'd never been in that kind of pain before. I didn't know what I'd sound like.

In the last few seconds of the video, the camera was raised and angled downwards such that you could see both "Angelica's" face and mangled hand. The shot gave the viewer a better view of her chest and the small, spade-shaped birthmark a few inches beneath her clavicle. It was this all-too-familiar mark that removed any lingering ambiguity about what I was watching. Angelica was no coincidence, no circumstantial doppelganger. 

She was a deepfake of *me.*

When the video ended, I sat staring at the final frame until my laptop went to sleep, too shocked to do anything else. I couldn't believe what was happening to me. I still can't. I've done everything "right": all my life I've kept my socials private and generally minded my own business. I've stayed modest, low-profile, and out of the spotlight for all of my young adulthood. I never even sent nudes to my ex-boyfriend, despite his insistence, because I was afraid of what would happen to them if we ever had a nasty breakup.   

As it turned out, we did have a messy breakup. In the immediate aftermath of that video, as I wracked my memory for answers, I couldn't help but think of my ex. If I were a public figure, then the culprit behind the deep fakes could've been anyone; but for a nobody like me, it had to be someone close. Someone with access to my private photos. The thought made me shudder. Could my ex really have taken things that far? Did he actually hate me that much? I had a sudden urge to call him and demand answers, but I knew that wouldn't get me far. It would be easy enough for him to lie if he was the culprit, and then he would know I was onto him.

There was much left for me to explore on the DOV3S website, but after my discovery, I wasn't in the right state of mind to keep investigating. I thought about calling someone, maybe Lydia or my parents, but for some reason, the thought of doing so filled me with tremendous embarrassment. Even though I knew deep down that it wasn't my fault, I couldn't help but feel ashamed of the videos, even if I had had no role in their creation. 

I needed sleep, but knew it would be nearly impossible, and so I popped a few sleeping pills and crossed my fingers. After tossing and turning in bed for a few minutes, I got up to use the bathroom, which required walking down the hallway past my front door. When I got to said door, I stopped, noticing a strange shadow coming from the hallway. It looked as though someone had placed an object right outside my door. I walked closer to look, about to crouch to peek under the door, when the shadow suddenly moved. It hadn't been an object at all, but rather a person standing in front of my door. I heard their footsteps thudding down the carpeted hallway. By the time I looked through the peephole, it was too late to see anyone, and I certainly wasn't about to open the door to look for them. I immediately suspected that it had something to do with the blue Cherokee, which was still parked across the street when I stole a glance out the window. 

Suddenly, I had no desire to sleep anymore, but the pills were already doing their job. I wanted to stay alert in case whoever was outside my door returned, but fighting against the drowsiness was like trying to outrun a monster in a nightmare. The last thing I imagined before I slipped into unconsciousness was my own face smiling jubilantly as a hammer smashed my hand into a bloody pulp.
