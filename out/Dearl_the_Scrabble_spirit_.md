I don't know if this is the right place to post this. I think our new cabin might be haunted. 

I decided to buy a cabin in my home state. It's got several acres of wooded land and a stocked pond. My uncle told me that an old hunting buddy of his was selling it and I thought it would be a steal for the price asked. The fishing is good, the cabin is comfortable, and I've let my family back home who hunt stay there to do so. 

A little over a year ago I reached out to the guy selling it, went through my bank, and closed. The fella who sold it to me turned out to be the father of an old classmate, Steve. This is relevant. 

I brought my wife and our teenage daughter there last spring to show them I wasn't wasting our money. They stayed there 2 nights with me. During the day we fished and relaxed, and at night we played games. They had an old Scrabble board left there and we pulled it out. 

I had an idea to add a fourth player. Basically, we were going to fill the little wooden tray with letters like a regular player, but display them for the 3 of us to see and work together to come up with words. My daughter joked that it's a ghost player and suggested we give them a name. I grabbed a handful of tiles, laid them down and said 'This is their name'. The letters spelled Earl, but there was an extra 'D'. So I said "It's Dearl!" And Dearl (we said it like Earl, so 'Durl') played with us both nights. We even wrote 'Dearl' on the wooden tray and drew a little sheet ghost.

Nothing spooky happened, it was Scrabble, not Ouija. But my daughter did say the cabin creeped her out a bit. She says the place has a weird vibe, and joked about the ghost Dearl multiple times. After 2 nights we left to spend time with family for the rest of our vacation. 

We returned this past fall and spent a couple more nights. We played Scrabble again, Dearl played with us. Then I spent the third night there with my cousin and brother in law. We were drinking, and one of them asked "What the hell is a Dearl?" I explained the joke and the game, and we played one round with Dearl.

This is where it gets fucked up. The next day I'm at Walmart and who do I see? Fucking Steve. Hadn't seen him in years, but I just bought a property from his dad so I figured the least I could do was say hello.

We make small talk and I tell him I can't believe his dad let that place go, especially in this market at that price. Steve says "I know, I grew up there. If we wasn't at the house, we was at the pond. I just don't think Dad could stand to go back after what happened." I asked him what he meant and he was surprised. He said he thought I knew. I asked for clarification. 

Now, Steve has a thick accent, like everyone in small town Kentucky. So my heart skipped a beat when he said "My little brother, Darryl... he killed himself out there." But with his accent, he pronounced it "Durl".

I was shocked at the name, but also honestly shocked that I just bought a property that someone committed suicide at. I was full of questions, but didn't want to pester him on a tender subject. 

I called my uncle after that. The son of a bitch knew about the suicide, but didn't mention it. Doesn't seem to bother him, since he stayed out there to hunt after I bought it. He told me Darryl (who I've never met) was going through a lot after a divorce. He shot himself in the head with a pistol. Wasn't messy, but it was over a day before he was found. 

Anyway, I don't know what to tell my wife or daughter. I probably won't tell them anything. I sank my entire savings into the down payment on this place, and my wife was supportive, but this might give her bad feelings about it. I especially don't know what to do about the Scrabble board. It feels wrong to mess with it. I put it away, and it might stay put away for good.

Honestly, I've never really believed in ghosts and I think this is an unfortunate coincidence, but my wife and daughter do believe and will be 100% creeped out if I tell them.
