When I was a kid, Christmas Eve was pure magic. I’d lie awake, listening for reindeer hooves or the soft rustle of Santa squeezing down the chimney. My parents played along perfectly, leaving half-eaten cookies and handwritten notes from Santa. Even when I figured out the truth, I never lost my love for the holiday—it became my turn to create the magic for my own kids.

This year, though, Christmas wasn’t what I expected. Something happened that I can’t explain, something that changed the way I see Christmas forever. I don’t know if I’ll ever feel safe in my home again.

It started as a perfectly normal Christmas Eve. Jack, my six-year-old, and Emma, who’s four, were beside themselves with excitement. They helped me leave out milk and cookies for Santa before Eric, my husband, and I tucked them into bed. Jack begged to stay up late and catch Santa in the act, but eventually, they both fell asleep.

By 11:00 p.m., Eric and I were in the living room, arranging gifts under the tree and filling stockings. We laughed as we drank hot cocoa, proud of the magic we’d made. It was the kind of night you see in Christmas commercials—warm, peaceful, full of love.

At midnight, Eric yawned and headed upstairs. I decided to stay up a little longer, enjoying the glow of the Christmas tree. That’s when I heard it.

A deep, muffled thud came from above me. At first, I thought it was snow sliding off the roof. Then came the sound of heavy footsteps, deliberate and slow, creaking across the ceiling. My first thought was burglars, but the sound didn’t match. It was too slow, too deliberate.

Then I heard the laugh.

“Ho… ho… ho…”

It wasn’t cheerful or jolly. It was deep, almost guttural, vibrating through the walls. My chest tightened, and I froze, staring at the fireplace. The fire had gone out hours ago, leaving the hearth cold and dark.

The footsteps moved closer, stopping directly above the chimney. For a moment, everything was silent. Then, with a loud scrape and a heavy thud, something landed inside the fireplace.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. My mind raced through every possibility—a prank, a home invasion—but none of it made sense.

And then he stepped out.

The figure was enormous, hunched as he emerged from the fireplace. His red coat was stained with soot, and the fur trim was matted and yellowed. His beard hung in tangled strands, streaked with ash. His boots left wet, filthy prints on the rug as he moved toward the tree.

I wanted to scream, but my voice was stuck in my throat. He didn’t seem to notice me. Or maybe he didn’t care. He knelt by the tree, his massive frame dwarfing the presents beneath it, and began pulling objects from the sack slung over his shoulder. The gifts didn’t look like the ones I’d wrapped. The paper was strange—dark and old, with patterns I didn’t recognize. The tags all read From Santa in a looping, elegant script.

When he finished placing the presents, he stood, brushing soot from his coat. His head tilted slightly, as if listening for something. Then, slowly, he turned his head toward me.

His eyes—coal-black and glinting—locked onto mine. For a moment, neither of us moved. Then he smiled, his lips stretching too wide, revealing rows of jagged, yellowed teeth.

“Merry Christmas,” he rumbled, his voice deep and hollow.

My legs finally obeyed me. I stumbled backward, my heart pounding, as he turned back to the fireplace. With a grunt, he hoisted himself up the chimney in one swift, unnatural motion. The room was silent again, except for my ragged breathing.

I don’t know how long I sat there, staring at the fireplace, trying to make sense of what I’d just seen. Eventually, Eric came downstairs, worried about the noise.

“What’s going on?” he asked, looking around. His eyes fell on the strange new gifts under the tree. “What are those?”

“He… he left them,” I whispered.

Eric frowned. “Who?”

“Santa.”

He laughed nervously. “Very funny. Did you… pick these up last-minute or something?”

I shook my head. “No.”

We both stared at the presents, neither of us wanting to touch them. Eventually, Eric bent down and picked one up. It was heavier than it should have been. The tag read, To Jack, From Santa.

“I don’t like this,” he said, setting it back down. “We should throw them out.”

But something stopped us. A feeling, almost like a warning, settled over the room. We left the gifts where they were and went upstairs, locking the bedroom door behind us.

The next morning, the kids were ecstatic to find the new presents. Jack tore into one immediately, revealing the exact LEGO set he’d been begging for. The same set I hadn’t been able to find anywhere.

“Santa brought it! I told you he was real!” Jack said, his eyes shining.

Emma opened her gift next—a porcelain doll with a strange, old-fashioned dress. She hugged it tightly, smiling. “I love her.”

I didn’t tell them what had happened. I didn’t tell Eric that when I looked closer at the doll, its glassy eyes seemed to follow me.

The kids played all day, happy and oblivious. But Eric and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. That night, I went back to the living room to clean up the wrapping paper. That’s when I noticed the fireplace.

The soot that had spilled onto the hearth wasn’t just a mess. It was a perfect imprint of two boots, far larger than any human’s.

And next to the boots, scrawled in ash, was a single word:

GOOD.
