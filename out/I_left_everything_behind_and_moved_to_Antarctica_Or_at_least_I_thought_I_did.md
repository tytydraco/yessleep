Since I was a kid, I always had this weird obsession with Antarctica. No idea why. Most people wanted to go to Paris or New York. Me? I wanted the ice. The silence. The emptiness. I’d open Google Earth and just stare at the bottom of the planet like it was my personal escape hatch.

I was born in Morocco. Had a normal life. Nothing crazy. My parents were decent people. I wasn’t rich. I wasn’t poor. I was just… there. Quiet kid. Daydreamer. I moved to Montréal in my early 20s to study financial management. And that’s when I felt it stronger than ever—the urge to disappear. Not in a dark way, not like I wanted to die. I just wanted out of the noise. Out of the expectations. Out of the routine.

Life in Montréal was the usual grind. School, part-time job, rent, stress, fake smiles. I’d eat ramen five times a week. I couldn’t even afford therapy, so I’d walk for hours in the cold just to clear my head. But every night before bed, I’d play recordings of Antarctic wind on YouTube and fall asleep to it. It was the only thing that made me feel calm.

By 22, I started getting serious. I opened a separate bank account—no card attached, no app access. I called it my “vanish fund.” I cut out all unnecessary spending. No Uber Eats, no Netflix, no going out. I pirated software, learned to cut my own hair (badly), and put aside anything I could—$100 here, $50 there. Took me over a year to get close to $5,000.

And then I started applying. Not for tourist trips. I couldn’t afford that. I went for jobs—support roles at research stations: janitor, cook, waste management, maintenance. Didn’t need a degree, just physical endurance and mental stability. After getting ignored a dozen times, I finally got an email from McMurdo Station: accepted for a 6-month contract as a Waste Management Technician.

The pay was $4,700/month, plus food and housing. Not glamorous, but to me, it was paradise. I didn’t tell anyone. Not my friends. Not my parents. I didn’t want to hear the questions or the guilt trips or the laughter. I left a note in my apartment with $200 cash for my landlord: “Keep the deposit. I’m sorry.” I scheduled an email to my mom that would send two months later: “I’m okay. I just needed to do something for me. I’ll explain everything later.”

I flew from Montréal to L.A., then to Christchurch, New Zealand. From there, I boarded a U.S. military cargo plane and landed in Antarctica. The first thing that hit me was the cold—it wasn’t like Montréal cold. It felt like the air itself was trying to push you out of your body. I couldn’t feel my face within five minutes. But I loved it.

At McMurdo, I met the weirdest, most amazing people. Nobody asked what you did back home. Nobody cared. There was a guy who used to be a hedge fund manager. Another who tried to be a rockstar. One woman just said, “I left a note and never looked back.” We were all runaways in some way.

My job wasn’t glamorous. I cleaned toilets, shoveled snow, sorted trash. But I’ve never felt more present. We had no phones, no scrolling, no fake smiles. We played board games. We read books. We had deep, stupid conversations at 2am while drinking powdered coffee. I saw auroras so bright they made me cry. I saw penguins up close. I saw myself.

I stayed for 187 days. Then I came back to the “real world.” Montréal felt alien. Loud. Overstimulating. I got a job again. Paid my bills. Went through the motions. But every night, I missed the wind. Not just any wind—that wind. Antarctica wind.

Then the twist came.

A few months ago, I started forgetting little things. People’s names. Appointments. Whether I had eaten that day. I figured it was burnout. But then one day I found my keys in the fridge and spent three hours thinking it was 2023. I finally went to a doctor. Did some tests. More tests. Brain scans.

Diagnosis: early-onset dementia. Twenty-four years old.

I laughed. I told him about Antarctica. I told him everything. The flights, the station, the people, the auroras. But he looked at me like I was telling him a dream.

“No flights. No contract. No records,” he said. I checked my inbox. No acceptance letter. No bank statements. No scheduled email to my mom. My landlord said I never left. My classmates said I never missed a semester. My phone was full of photos from Montreal during the exact same time I swore I was in Antarctica.

So now I don’t know.

Did I really go?

Did I imagine the whole thing?

Did my brain, under so much pressure, so much noise, just… create an escape?

I remember the cold. I remember the sky. I remember the smell of the station—bleach and ice and metal. But none of it is real.

Or maybe it was. And I just came back different. Or broken.

Every night now, I lay in bed and hear that wind again. Not through YouTube. Just… in my head. Soft. Haunting. Like it’s calling me back. Like it’s the only part of me that hasn’t faded.

Maybe I went.

Maybe I didn’t.

Maybe I’m still there right now—on a break, outside the station, looking at the stars and imagining what it would be like to come back to Montréal and forget everything.

I don’t know anymore.

But if you ever hear the wind at night, and it sounds just a little too far away, like it’s whispering—

It might not be the wind.

It might be me.

Still out there.

Still trying to remember what was real.
