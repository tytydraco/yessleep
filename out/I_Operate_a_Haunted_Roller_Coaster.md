I operate a Haunted Roller Coaster 

I operate a “haunted” roller coaster is probably a better way to word it normally. I work at a local amusement park and have to push the button to let riders “prepare for their scare.” 

I would tell you where it’s located, but I’m quite scared to for a few reasons. One of those may be for my safety. Another would be for yours if you felt like investigating. 

It’s a pretty cool indoor attraction though some would call it cheesy. The rider gets on the small coaster that has eight rows on it, two riders per row. 

It moves rather slowly and filled with animatronics. The first turn shows a foggy graveyard where hands pop up and down in front of the tombstones. 

Past the turn is where you see bats hanging and a vampire that stands near the coaster and always says “I want to suck your blood•”

It goes straight for a short time and cuts right. That’s where you’ll see mannequins with sheets over them that make some spooky ghost moans. 

It continues on where you see hear some screams and a blow mold of a werewolf head pops up behind some fake bushes when you hear some howling. 

You then go slightly uphill when you see a tiny cottage. The doors always opened and an animatronic witch with a long nose  comes out with a broom in her hand. She has three catch phrases.

“I’ll get you my pretty.” “Come inside if you dare.” Or it’s just cackling. She then goes back into the house. 

There is a door that slowly opens with a few funny mirrors that make you change size is on the walls. A zombie about “grabs” you while you go down a mild hill at a slightly accelerated speed. 

Then you see a few mummy decoys and a Frankenstein before it turns back to where you unload and new riders get their turn.

I walked towards the attraction with my “spooky” outfit (which is a butlers outfit) and a mug full of black coffee. This job was supposed to help my college tuition.

I was the only one down there so far. Im not too long I would be joined by a beautiful brown haired girl who I’ve had a crush on ever since I got here, and an older guy who decided to do this with his retirement. We’d all take turns usually of hitting the buttons and making sure guests were clear. 

I sat down my coffee cup and looked at a few of the cameras that are secretly hidden so we could see and be alerted if someone tried to sneak off the coaster, which has happened before. I looked at the panel where all the knobs and buttons are and seen a note.

“Good morning, part of your task today is to walk through the attraction and make sure everything looks good to go. Make sure there’s no trash and everything is in order. Use your walkie and let me know once the job is done- Tim.” 

That felt so weird to me. Usually it was maintenance job to do a daily walk through. Some middle age guy named Frank comes and  checks the sensors and makes sure all the spooky guys are doing what they are supposed to. 

Either way, I reached below to where we keep the flashlights and I went walking on the trail. The only time we ever had to be inside is when the ride breaks down and the lights are already on. 

Walking in felt eerie. The lights were off and music was playing. Usually I have to hit a master start button to get things rolling. I assumed that maintenance came through and hit it, sometimes they do. 

I turned the corner and walked past the graveyard where the hands were moving up and down. I shined my light down towards the tracks to make sure no one threw down anything like snack wrappers or sunglasses. O shined my light towards the arrows painted on the ground and kept moving. 

I walked right past the vampire who said his line when my foot got near a sensor. I went past the ghosts and past the werewolf. I felt nervous though because I could have sworn I seen the wolf blink. 

I made my way up the hill and shined my light towards the cottage. It was clean around the area but something was off. The witch didn’t come out. I figured I’d have to contact maintenance and let them know before guests get on and find out. I shined my light towards the door and noticed the door was opened but I couldn’t see her propped back. 

I walked to the little prop home and peeked my head inside. She was nowhere in there. I shined my light all over. I pulled out my walkie. 

“Hey Tim, Gerald here. Something weird is going on and the witch is gone.” There was silence so I repeated it once more. A voice came back through.

“My, my. That is a problem.” It wasn’t Tim’s  voice. It wasn’t even a male voice.

“Who is this?” 

I heard a loud cackle. I ran towards the next area where there would be stairs I could get down and make my way closer to exiting. I got knocked down and felt a heavy weight on me.

She was on top of me laughing. I see you found note, dear boy”. She put her hands around my neck. I hit her in the eye as hard as I could with my flashlight. Sparks shout out her eyes as she rolled off me. 

I seen a body lying in front of the staircase. It was Frank. She screeched.

“You won’t get away from me dearie.” I looked back and tripped over Franks body. I fell down the stairs and blacked out.

I awoke in the hospital and Tim was sitting by my bedside. 

“You had quite a fall. Lucky you didn’t break your neck.” 

“The…the witch.” 

“The ride closed down for a few hours while we…made sure everything was in order.” 

“I don’t care about the ride. What about Frank.”

“What about him? What do you mean you don’t care about the ride?” 

I was so weak and could feel the anger rising up in me. He looked down at me.

“Look, we’re paying this bill and you’re getting a few weeks paid. For some reason, she disappears the day before it’s Friday the 13th, we just have to find her first and do something to stop her exploring….look, this place brings in a whole lot of money so when you come back-“

“I’m not sure if I want to come back.”

Tim let out a sinister chuckle.

“No, no. I think it’s best if you come back. That is if you know what’s best for you. She might not appreciate you doing that.”  He stood up. “We’ll call you sometime soon.” He walked out the door.

I got off the phone with my parents and let them know I was fine. I was too scared to tell them about what happened really. I was surprised when my crush walked in to check on me. Her face was pale white and concerned. She talked about Frank not showing up to work and how the whole ride felt eerie. She talked about how she was concerned for me. What she said next made me speechless.

“You know how there’s always been five ghosts in that area after the werewolf? Now there’s six.”
