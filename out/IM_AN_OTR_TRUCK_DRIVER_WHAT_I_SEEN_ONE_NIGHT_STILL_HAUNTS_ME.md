My name is Carlos I have been a truck driver for 10 years now, running nearly the same 3 routes for the past 10 years, I decided it was time for a change. 
I asked the boss man Rick if I could change it up a bit and take some routes through the Midwest and western United States. 

“No problem”he said, boy that was easy I thought. Thinking I should have asked a while back. “I gotta tell you though” he said “there are a few states out that way that have scared a few a my drivers into quitting”  “why’s that” I said“dunno he said just all the sudden up and quit on me no explanation nothing”

Finding that kinda odd, It wasn’t a worry to me. 
I start in the morning pick up in Cleveland Ohio, and transport to Bend, Oregon. Should be exciting as I’ve never went any further west than Nebraska or Kansas.

I couldn’t sleep I was so excited about my new route, I was up most of the night mapping out my best possible routes. Around weigh stations of course, as all they do is slow you down or ticket you a nice chunk of money for being overweight. 

I took off about 6am. Jacked up on 6 cups of coffee. I made it to Cleveland in no time from Cincinnati. Got my load and was set to make my way to Oregon. After about 12 hours of being on the road I decided to call it quits for the day and pulled in at a truck stop just outside of Springfield Illinois.

It was a rather quiet truck stop had about 30-40 trucks there so I found my place to park and crawled into my sleeper, and was out within 5 minutes. I awoke early the next morning a little groggy, I slammed a few espresso coffees. Bought a few packs of yellow jacket pills, the ones that used to have ephedra in them. Took a couple as I knew it was going to be a long tough day. 

Driving was smooth no problems. Was even able to go 5mph over the speed limit with no issues from police or anything. Night was setting in again quick as I was entering Wyoming just outside of Cheyenne it was 2am. Finding it hard to keep my eyes open, I splashed my face with water and it seemed to wake me up for a little bit.

I seemed to be the only one on the road, then up ahead I seen a figure in the road so I immediately started to slow down. As I got closer it appeared to be a man in a hoodie with a scarf around his face. 
Being fall it was getting a little chilly, but what the hell was he doing way out here at this hour I thought. I tried to pull beside him roll down my window to ask if everything was alright, but he turned and started running out into the trees.

This startled me a bit, I couldn’t see his face and he just took off. It stayed on my mind for the next few minutes then I started really feeling tired, so found the next rest area just outside of Cheyenne and pulled in. 

I slept for about an hour or two, and something had awakened me for some reason. I got a hunch to turn on my headlights as it was pitch black out and I was the only vehicle in the parking lot. And sure enough there was a figure just at the end of where my headlights reached. It was that same man, except this time I could see his face and he had blacked out eyes an unnaturally long smile from ear to ear, rows of teeth, not human teeth either. 

I was terrified now and immediately started my truck as fast as I could and took off. The man was just standing there staring at me as I left. I couldn’t believe how he had caught up to me on foot in that short amount of time. I was at least 20 miles up the road from where I first seen him. I was wide awake now horrified by what just happened, I never seen anything like that. 

I wondered if I was hallucinating from the lack of sleep the past couple days, but then again it seemed real to me. I drove about another hour up the road to the other side of Cheyenne Wyoming and took a much needed 8 hour rest break. 

The rest of trip was successful with no other problems, I decided to take a different route back and everything was smooth. I told my boss Rick what had happened on the route and he could only say “told you so” would you like your old route back”. 
As much as I didn’t want to, I accepted as I’ve never had an experience like that in all my years of trucking.
