CW: Harm against children.

&#x200B;

First of all, I want to apologize for the long time between updates. It’s just that… certain things have started sprouting from the inception of me telling my story. When I met with my family over the weekend, Amy introduced me to someone who’s been writing up on these types of strange experiences. I was being vague in my last post because I still don’t entirely believe what we experienced. I made mention of the fact that ‘Dr. Bonbon’ was real… because he was, he was tangible, he was dangerous, he was REAL. But that in no way means that I believe he was just any guy… there was something I could never explain about him and his actions. The way he always knew where we were, his almost lacking need of sleep… because I mean, what man can just call multiple phones 24/7 without a single break. Just the way he showed up and disappeared from our lives almost like in a snap of a finger he exists and then he doesn’t. But the part that gets me the most… I heard his voice, I’ve seen the rocks he threw, I’ve seen his vehicles, and I saw the effect he had on the world around me… but never once during those seven years have *I* ever truly seen *Him*.

  
  
The closest anybody ever got was Amy who, despite having walked home with him on multiple occasions, could never describe or even remember what he looked like. But there was the time I saw his shadow at our grandmother’s house when I was eight years old. And that’s the encounter I’ll be telling you about.

  
  
I remember it was late November after I had turned eight. We still had no phones and almost no contact with most of the outside world save a few neighbors and close family friends. Amy, our mom, and I still can’t recall what exactly led up to this aside from general safety concerns, but we managed to get into contact with our grandma who said she would see after us kids for the rest of that year. 

  
  
I remember the night before heading to grandma’s was intense. It was another, albeit temporary, move to a location I’ve never lived before where the only people I’d know were my grandma and Amy. That night, me and Amy slept in the same bed… and I kept fearing the worst. For context, ‘Dr. Bonbon’s’ nightly visits weren’t as common as they used to be and were fleeting in moments. He had mostly shifted to attempts at calling us and our neighbors and watching us come home… always watching. But something felt off, I could just tell that he knew we were planning on something, and he wasn’t going to let this be the last time we met. That night was filled with dread, the air as still as stone, and the slightest breath would have woken the whole house. I remember fading off, finally feeling like slumber would embrace me…when I saw it…high beams. The sight of a car’s high beams blistering through my window that night only confounded this dread, and it endowed this little seed of a thought… going to Grandma’s isn’t going to solve anything.

  
  
I remember just staying awake, staring intently at my window… just waiting for the worst to happen. But thankfully it never did… and I somehow managed to sleep that night.

  
  
I don’t particularly remember all too much about the drive up to grandma’s house, but there was one detail me and Amy recalled that sparked the interest of Amy’s friend, Carrie. On our drive to grandma’s, which was a 30–45-minute venture out into the middle of the woods we made every holiday to spend time with her, we noticed a strange town that had never been there before. And I don’t mean newly built either… a populated town that just kind of popped up out of nowhere. I won’t go too into detail about this as of now. Carrie promised to share her experiences next week on my account, so I’ll leave it to her… but it is an important detail that I want you to remember for when she tells her story.

  
  
When we finally did get to grandma’s, it was the same old Victorian mansion it always was. As beautiful as her house was, I’m not lying when I tell you that her house looked straight out of *The Haunting* or something. Now the thing about her house was that it also came with a lot of land and was nearby a stream. Grandma only had one neighbor, a very old woman named Janice who lived up the street from grandma’s house with her grandson, Mike. For the next few days while settling in… that once persistent dread started to subside. Me and Amy both befriended Mike during our stay and played a lot with Mike, albeit with a lot of grandparental guidance.

  
  
Mike was a really sweet seven-year-old towheaded boy, which is probably why we became friends so fast. I remember Amy being a bit slow to warm up to him, but she eventually came around when we all played “pirates” in the forest near the stream. This became our new routine, after we finished homeschooling… we’d set out for the gray, twisted woods with Mike to head on our next adventure. For some reason, I can distinctly recall our characters… I was Percy MacIntyre, the most beautiful pirate the oceans have ever seen. Mike was called Fox, the most daring and rich pirate… and we designated Amy as the cabin girl, Loey. 

  
  
It was during these many “adventures”  that we would run parallel the creek, which by this point had frozen completely over… looking like it was entirely made out of the clearest crystal you’ve ever seen. We were “hunting for treasure” as we traveled south from my house, when Mike all of a sudden took a break from our strenuous, dashing, and ever so riveting role play. I had paused and asked him what the problem was.

  
  
“No one knows who they are.” He remarked as he grabbed a twisted stick and pointed across the creek. I followed where he was looking… only to see that strange town.

  
  
Amy’s shivering voice creaked from behind us, “Where did they come from? I don’t remember seeing that town there before.”

  
  
“We don’t know.” I could sense the primal fear in Mike’s voice. “Just promise you’ll never go over there.”

  
  
I don’t quite recall all of the details after that slight interruption, but after what Carrie had told us… this all makes way too much sense. But from what I can recall, it was getting late, and the winter air started to scorch our young skin playing in the nightly woods. All three of us began the trek back to grandma’s, passing a strange, abandoned shack. We didn’t quite realize how far we had walked while playing… but it truly felt like years, yet the forest never gave. As the dark blue of the sky faded into pure black, worry engulfed my every thought. It was only made worse as we came upon a clearing amongst the barren trees. There it stood… that shack. We walked a damn circle… we were lost, and the night kept getting darker, the air growing morbidly colder. 

  
  
“Where the hell is the house?” Looking back, it’s funny to think how Mike saying a bad word was more shocking to Amy and me rather than being lost.

  
  
“You said a bad word!” Amy announced as if it was the most pressing issue at hand.

  
  
“Mike, let’s keep going. We’ll find my house eventually.”

  
  
We kept trekking forth, each tree looking like an emaciated amalgamation of bones in the dark. As we kept walking, I stopped periodically… it almost sounded like someone was trailing with us just to our left. We would walk- and then *snap* \- a twig broke just to our left. 

  
  
The sounds were just out of reach enough to not be able to see or locate its source. But they were just close enough to know that whatever was there knew we were there too. As we continued forward, I stopped again… *snap*.

  
  
“Emma, what are you doing?” Mike questioned with trepidation.

  
  
“Listen.”

  
  
The other two stopped in their tracks and all of us began to intently listen. The growing wind howled like a distant beast and the subtle chill in the air became deafening. But we continued to listen, knowing that something was there. Just out of reach- just out of sight in the snowy dark blanketed before us… something- someone was watching.

  
  
…

  
  
S*nap*

  
  
…

  
  
The distant breaking of a twig shook all three of us from our petrified state, sending us blindly running back into the darkness of the winter forest. The chilling winter wind against my ears began sounding like a maniacal laughter. Each breath felt like my little lungs were filling with an inferno from the deathly cold. And then we came back upon a clearing in the woods…

  
  
We ran in a damn circle again and ended up back at the shack.

  
  
“What are we going to do?” I chirped quietly.

  
  
“Go home.”

  
  
“Amy, we’re lost, we can’t go home.”

  
  
“Then let’s stay in the shack, our grandmas have to come looking for us soon.” Mike pitched in.

  
  
None of us liked the idea but it really did seem like the only answer at the time. Stay in the rundown serial killer shack… or stay outside in the pitch black cold with whatever was following us.

  
  
The shack was honestly the best decision. When we entered, Mike went snooping around while Amy and I found blankets to cover up with.

  
  
“Hey, look what I found!” Mike said while flicking on an old flashlight.

  
  
As Mike looked around the shack, we found out that it was an old toolshed… grandma’s toolshed. Which meant we were really close to the house thankfully. Mike then came to our little makeshift blanket fort… must’ve been grandma’s blanket storage as well, there was a whole closet filled with dusty old quilts. A lot of this next part does mostly skip me so I’m relying on Amy’s recollection here. During our little stay in this shack, all three of us began noticing what sounded like crunches in the snow. Slowly but surely inching forward toward the door of the shack. We turned off the flashlight and sat under our blanket fort as quietly as possible… intently peeking through the cracks at the window. 

  
  
It felt like collectively all of our hearts sank… as the silhouette of a tall figure slowly approached the window. There it stood… placing its hands up onto the glass- pearing in. The atmosphere was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Its cold breath fogged up the window as it intently looked in… and the fears of ‘Dr. Bonbon’ came back in full force. It slowly left the window, and that’s when it started jiggling the doorknob. Each yank of the handle sent ripples through the atmosphere. And all of the life flushed from our small bodies… when the door creaked open as loud as it possibly could. The cold air swathed our bodies with an intense chill only amplified by the sound of the silhouette’s footsteps creaking across the floorboards.

  
  
“Mike, get out from under there! You three were supposed to be back before dark!”

  
  
Janice’s creaky old voice sent all of our souls flying when she yelled at us. Needless to say, our grandmothers were rightfully pissed at our little venture in the dark woods.

  
  
The next day, our grandma seemed to ease up on us and collected Amy and I into the kitchen. She placed a bunch of utensils on the counter and both me and Amy’s eyes grew wide with excitement. Gingerbread Cookies!

  
  
The whole morning, we were baking and decorating a village’s worth of gingerbread people for the upcoming Christmas season. I relish this memory a lot… a time of normalcy before one of the worst things I ever had to experience.

  
  
Splattering red, green, and white icing onto my gingerbread family… everything came rushing back… the sleepless nights, the fear of being watched… that God damn phone. Grandma went to go pick it up as me and Amy rushed up the steps and instinctively hid in our room. It must’ve been ten whole minutes before grandma came trudging up the steps. When she came into our room, we snuck up from under our beds… both of us with our stuffed animal protectors in hand.

  
  
“Did Mike come back here after he went home last night?” Grandma asked with a quizzical look on her face.

  
  
We both answered “No” before grandma told us that… Mike was missing from home. Shocked by this news, we all went outside to see if he was near our stream we played at.

  
  
Nothing.

  
  
Absolutely no sign of the boy.

  
  
And it would remain that way for the next few days, Mike never came back home. No one ever saw him again… that was until… Christmas Eve.

  
  
Amy and I had set up Christmas lights in our room as we were falling asleep to the sound of *Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer* playing on an old box tv. The blurry lights engulfed my darkening vision as sleep began to take me. It couldn’t have been more than an hour later when Amy and I woke to a slight metallic thud. Neither of us could determine what it was in our groggy haze, but both of us were definitely a bit spooked. This feeling would intensify as the sound of shuffling could be heard growing louder.

  
  
Both of us then began to pinpoint where the noise was coming from… right… below… the window. The noise grew louder and louder- no, we realized it was getting closer and closer. 

  
  
*Tap*

  
  
The weight of the world crashed down on my eight-year-old psyche. He was back. Tapping at our window. *Tap Tap Tap*. I laid there in bed, as frozen as the creek by our house with the sheets covering my eyes. Amy began to whimper and hugged me as tears flowed from her auburn eyes. 

  
  
“Hey guys! Come play with me!”

  
  
That made no sense to me… Mike? That was his voice, what was he doing tapping our window at this time of night? Was he not freezing to death? Where did he go when his grandma called ours… saying he was missing?

  
  
I slowly lowered the warm sheets from my eyes and was flooded with a barrage of red, blue, green, purple, and white lights. But with the lights reflecting off of the window, the chill infesting the outside of the glass, and the darkness engulfing the night… I couldn’t see Mike. That was, until he poked his eyes up from under the window and lifted his finger to tap on the glass.

  
  
*Tap Tap Tap* “Why don’t you come play with me?”

  
  
It still wasn’t quite making sense. Why was Mike outside our window asking to play at night? To Amy’s justified dismay, I got out of bed to get a better view of Mike… cause something was off, he looked oddly pale from our window. But as I got closer and closer, each step corresponding with a house-shaking heartbeat, I began to notice something. Behind Mike… there was a silhouette… a man… oh god… it was him!

  
  
I began to scream and Amy quickly followed suit at the realization that he… this ‘Dr. Bonbon’... was outside our window with Mike. Our grandma came barreling down the hall and entered our room right after Mike and that bastard seemingly drifted off into the darkness of the winter night. And of course, our grandma called the cops… only to find the line completely dead. Amy and I slept in grandma’s room that night like mice… skittish at every noise heard… completely and alarmingly aware of all of our surroundings. While our grandma watched over us with her shotgun in hand.

  
  
But the worst had yet to come. Despite the events of the previous night, our grandma continued on with Christmas that morning to lighten the mood for us youngsters. All went well for the time being. Opening Christmas gifts with joy, while listening to yuletide tunes that, despite our circumstances, still brought a sense of comfort. One of Grandma’s gifts to me was one of those stick horses and I couldn’t wait to play with it outside. Deciding to give us a bit of time to indulge with our new toys before we headed off to our parents’ house to celebrate there, Grandma let me, and Amy play outside.

  
  
I recall pretending to ride my new horse toy around the side of the house… until I came across where our bedroom window was on the second story. Right below it leaned a rickety, old latter. And laying out in front of the latter was something indiscernible at first… until I got closer. Sprawled before me were the dismembered arms and head of Mike shoved on sticks like a crude puppet… broken twigs   
laid around what remained of his body… arranged into an awful, haunting sentence -

  
  
“Merry Christmas, your one and only true friend”
