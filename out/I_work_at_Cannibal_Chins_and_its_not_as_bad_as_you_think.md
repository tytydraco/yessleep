I'm only posting this to disprove some of the accusations made by the powers that be against me, the owner, and one of my co-workers.  
  
First, Adrian Nelson is a liar. If you ever happen to be in the northeastern side of New Jersey and happen to run into a long haired guy with a lumberjack-esque beard who looks like he's seen a ghost, don't believe a word he says. I know for a fact that Adrian did not, in fact, survive the, let's say, "incident" on March 3rd. His spirit or whatever is eternally bound to the restaurant (just a thing that happens when you die within the property line). If you find "Adrian" anywhere outside of the restaurant's parking lot, ignore him. It's better for your mental health.  
  
Second, the owner does not spend all his time mutilating himself to make our products. Is it true that he may have accidentally cut off his finger while teaching the Cook how to, ya know, cook? Yes. Did that severed finger fall into one of the greasers along with the fries? Also yes. Did a customer eat that finger? Yes. What followed afterward was a long series of lawsuits, the restaurant being shut down for a few months, and the owner eventually rebranding to "Cannibal Chin's" to capitalize on his own grisly story. But since that first accident, the owner does not use any of his body parts to feed the patrons. At least I don't think he does.  
  
Come to think about it, I've never actually seen a delivery truck come to the restaurant. Whatever, that's above my paygrade anyway.  
  
Also no one of or relating to Cannibal Chin's discriminates against the undead. A few of New Jersey's local "witches" decided to hold a Ouiji board sermon or something in the restaurant one day. They claimed that the restaurant's proximity to the meadowlands was actually great for thinning the veil between this mortal coil and the world beyond. A few dozen cups of water and two baskets of free breadsticks later, the red haired, tatted up, wide eyed "witch" got up from her table and approached me at the counter.  
  
"Hi," I said, trying my best to maintain my composure for these people that surely wouldn't even tip, "Would you like to order something?"  
  
The red haired "witch", who I had taken to calling Red, moved her hair out of her eyes and cleared her throat, "My coven and I would like to file a formal complaint against your service, ma'am."  
  
"What?" I said.  
  
I must have looked more shocked than I was actually feeling, because I saw the most shit eating grin creep across Red's face as she said, "Your soul is tainted."  
  
I raised my eyebrow, faked a concerned frown, and waited for her to continue. I've found it easier to placate most of the customers rather than ignore them or be rude. Things tend to go more smoothly that way, at least in my experience.  
  
"You've become corrupt by capitalism, bureaucracy, and greed. It's made you apathetic. You're so far from reaching the light of Satan right now that you might as well be in Purgatory. You know nothing, and are nothing. Just an inky black void floating around, waiting for something to come along and put you out of your misery."  
  
Well, if she wanted to insult me, she wasn't doing a great job. She was annoying me, mostly, kind of like all those psychiatrists the company made me see after my first six months working here.  
  
"There is a way you can help yourself though," She told me, holding her hand outstretched to me. Whether she wanted me to take it or not was anyone's guess, but I damn sure wasn't making any physical contact with her if I could avoid it.  
  
Instead though, one of the other witches handed Red a small, rusted key with a five pointed star welded onto the end of it. I didn't even see this one get up from the booth. They were silent, like a fart in the wind.  
  
This one was androgynous looking, with long black hair kept in dreadlocks, snakebite piercings, and a tattoo under their right eye. I guess it was supposed to be some kind of archaic, runic, otherworldly sigil, but to me it just looked like a toddler tried to draw a key on their face.  
  
The second "witch", who I'm calling Key, stared at me after they handed the key to Red. They had bulging, beady green eyes that honestly seemed like they were going to fall out of their head. They didn't blink, their gaze never wandered.  
  
Now that was unnerving.  
  
Red handed me the key (with Key still silently watching me. I was starting to feel like a rabbit in front of a lion), and winked. She turned around, taking Key in their arm, and walked toward the door. The third "witch" got up from the booth to follow them, never saying a word or looking at me at all. Thank god for small miracles.  
  
Before Red crossed the threshold separating the inside from the outside, she yelled back over her shoulder, "You'll thank me later!", and let the door close after her.  
  
When they were gone, I went to bus their table but I was surprised to find that their table was actually clean. Like, more than clean. More than spotless, even. It was practically brand new. The years of stains and dried up half-fake, half-maybe real blood, splinters, dust, it was all gone. The seats were refurbished and crisp, like they'd been taken from the set of a 1950's malt shop, which was strange because the seats were rentals from the previous owners of this building.  
  
I knew that for a fact because I helped move them in here. This level of cleanliness should have been impossible for anyone to do, let alone while sitting at a table right in front of me and playing with a Ouija board. I'm not complaining in the slightest, it's just very unusual.  
  
On top of all of that though, they left a pretty decent tip, despite not ordering anything. It's not often there are, well, "nice" things that happen in the restaurant.  
  
Circling back to Adrian Nelson, my good for nothing coworker whose presence in this story is, regrettably, too large. A few weeks after the "witches" left the restaurant, the owner came out of the back, walked to the entrance, hung up our "Closed" sign, and locked the door.  
  
He looked a lot worse for wear than the last time I saw him; his eyes were bloodshot, his fingernails were gnarled and gangly, like they'd been untrimmed for at least several months. His beard was a shade of grey that was almost unnatural for someone his age. His apron was stained with way more blood than normal. I doubt all of that was his. The coloring was off.  
  
The owner grabbed my shoulders, whispering frantically to me, "Marceline, I need you to go into the basement RIGHT NOW. There's something down there and it's got Adrian and the Cook held hostage."  
  
"What uh," I stuttered, "What the fuck is down there?"  
  
"I have no idea, but it's not friendly."  
  
"Well what do you expect me to do!" I asked him.  
  
He shrugged, "Use your feminine charm or something, I don't know. The restaurant will close if I go down there and die, and we can't replace the Cook because of- we can't replace him. Look, in all honesty I just need you to save the Cook. If you can snag Adrian too, great! If not, oh well!"  
  
"And what if I...?"  
  
"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it."  
  
I have to admit; it wasn't the most reassuring thing that I've heard the owner tell me. Pep talks were never really his thing. Usually when there's an unruly customer or one of the attic ghosts starts terrorizing some poor patron with a hint of faith in their heart, I'm pretty well prepared to handle the situation. The owner was always giving me praise about using my feminine charm to "handle things", and he was generally pretty positive. A little awkward, sure, strange maybe, but positive.   
  
This time though I could tell he was losing his cool.   
  
"Welp," He said, patting me on the shoulder, "best of luck to ya Marcy!"   
  
He wasn't seriously expecting me to handle this alone, right? I mean, it was the basement. Like, THE basement. Like the basement where most people don't come out of with all their fingers and toes. The same basement where all those containment fiction authors were found dead after they framed that one woman and put her wife in the mental hospital.   
  
"You're not going to help?"  
  
"You kidding me? There's a fucking critter down there and I am the LEAST qualified person in this fine establishment to handle that sort of thing." He walked to the backdoor, looked over his shoulder, and smiled before closing it.  
  
Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Why didn't I just leave well enough alone and quit my job right then and there? Honestly it's because I barely make enough to afford the place that I'm staying in right now. There's also the fact that I'm just not that kind of person anymore, or at least I try very hard not to be. I value self preservation as much as the next person but my therapist keeps telling me that the road to healing is paved with genuine effort to improve.   
  
I'm not going to get into the ever-growing list of reasons why I felt like I at least had to save one of them. I just need you to understand that it's hard living alone in this economy, even harder finding a decent paying job like this with a past like mine. I'm not going to risk my comfort and security over a silly thing like monsters or cannibals in the basement.   
  
I wasn't about to go down there unprepared either.   
  
The Cook was, for lack of a better word, an introvert. He never showed his face, never really talked to me or Adrian or any of the other part-timers. He was never late and always left on time. Never once complained about the ghosts or the hallucinations, and he never let anyone touch his utensils.   
  
I respected the Cook. He was a good guy, I think. I mean, he wasn't a terrible person as far as I was concerned and who am I to dig into anyone's past? Surely he'd understand that I needed a weapon to defend myself from the thing in the basement.   
  
His set of utensils was exactly where it always was at the end of his shift; hung up on the wall just above the grill, all neat and organized in his mini suitcase carrying thing. I opened the case, took out two of the longest, scariest looking knives that I could find, and headed toward the basement door.   
  
The padlock on the door was cut in half, and the door itself was still cracked open. I could feel a cold breeze blowing on my face as I touched the handle. As I stared into the inky abyss that awaited me at the bottom of the stairs I felt chills run down my spine. I took a deep breath and cursed.   
  
This was going to suck.  
  
The darkness of the basement was oppressive. I want you to imagine this; close your eyes for a minute. See how you can't really see anything? Imagine that level of darkness but multiplied by a hundred. I couldn't even see my hands if I held them in front of my face. My footsteps echoed in the void as I walked around down there aimlessly. I wanted to use the flashlight on my phone but I was both terrified of what I would see and worried that only having one knife in my hand wouldn't be enough to defend myself.   
  
I pressed on, anxiously waiting for something, anything, to jump out and attack me. It was like waiting for the scare at the end of a bad horror game, only worse. I felt small down there, and alone. After a while I couldn't even hear my footsteps anymore.   
  
Something knocked a crate over near me and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. I swallowed hard, trying to get a glimpse of anything in the darkness.   
  
"I'm armed!" I shouted, although my voice felt unusually quiet.   
  
Another crash, closer to me this time. I heard some kind of weird, wet, slithering noise come from in between my feet. Sounded like a wet snake moving through mud. At first it was just the one sound. Then I heard it again, and again, growing louder and louder with each passing second.   
  
One of the things between my legs tripped me and I fell for what felt like ages until I landed flat on my ass. I had lost my grip on the knives on impact and I couldn't see them anymore. My heart started beating a thousand times a second. My hands, trembling and unsure of themselves, fumbled into my pocket to pull out my phone.   
  
I could hear it, whatever it was. It was getting louder, angrier. I could feel the very fiber of my being searching desperately for an escape. My lungs were crying for me to let out a scream, but I knew that screaming in situations like this only made things worse. I fought the terror for control of my body long enough to turn my phone's flashlight on.  
  
And then I saw it.  
  
I don't even have the words to describe the creature that stood before me. It was enormous but small at the same time. It had six bulbous heads, each with a hundred thousand beady eyes that stared at me with abject hatred. Its skin was like a wet paper bag being torn apart and stitched together by someone with no knowledge of the laws of physics. Thousands of slimey, greasy tentacles wriggled and writhed in a swirling mass of flesh all around me and the creature.   
  
I could feel its gaze boring holes into my soul. It was curious why I was down here, no, how I was down here and still alive. I felt the call of a hundred wailing voices of the damned resonate inside my skull. The thing reached out with one of its tentacles to touch me, but I was so paralyzed with fear that I couldn't think to run away.   
  
"Does it wish to know Me?" The thing asked.  
  
My head was rattling with thoughts running marathons inside it.  
  
"It will know Me in time. Your employer has defied Me. Made a mockery of My image."  
  
I had no idea what it was talking about.  
  
Like it read my thoughts, it said, "You know not of this blasphemy? Why have you come?"  
  
I swallowed hard and forced myself to speak, "I'm looking for my co-workers. The Cook and Adrian Nelson? I heard that, um, you... might have seen them?"  
  
"Does it wish to join them?"  
  
"N-no, I'm actually trying to get them back upstairs. Th-the restaurant needs-"  
  
The thing made the most horrific noise I've ever heard, like metal being crunched together and scraped along a chalkboard, "It is selfish. It thinks not of others, but only itself. "The restaurant needs'' BAH! What of My needs?"  
  
I stuttered, "What do you need?"   
  
The creature thrashed. The tentacles on the ground beneath me wrapped around my waist and brought me up to the thing's faces. Its breath smelled like sour milk and gummy bears.  
  
"FLESH! Ethan Chin has deprived Me of flesh for weeks! I hunger for it. I yearn for it," The creature narrowed its thousand eyes, "Will it satiate my famine?"  
  
I thought very carefully about my next choice of words.  
  
"Uh... no. But if you let me and my friends go, I will personally make sure that you get the leftover food at the end of every day!"  
  
"Bah! I hunger now! I will consume it."  
  
"No wait! If you eat me then how are you going to, ya know, not go hungry anymore? Mr. Chin won't come down here, that's why he sent us. If all of us are gone then he's going to lock the door and make sure that the next batch of employees knows nothing about you. You'll be satisfied for now but how long will that last?"  
  
The thing released its grip on me and I landed on my feet this time. Thank God.   
  
From the darkness I saw Adrian and the Cook, both bound in the tentacles. They were emaciated, hardly anything but flesh and bone. Their had had gone white, eyes sunken in, and their figures were hardly human anymore. As I shined my flashlight on them, Adrian looked at me. I could see the panic in his eyes.  
  
"I will eat one. The other will go with it. It will keep its word, or it will know Me."  
  
"You mean I have to choose?"  
  
"It could choose neither and leave, or it can choose one and leave. I will not starve any longer."  
  
Fucking great.  
  
Adrian spoke first. His voice was weak and fragile. It sounded like he was going to fall apart if he sneezed too hard, "Marceline... help..."  
  
I racked my brain, trying to come up with a solution to save them both. As I stood there thinking though, the creature tightened its grip on the both of them, causing Adrian to let out a pained groan. I sighed.  
  
"Give me the Cook."  
  
Adrian's eyes widened so much I thought they'd fall out of their sockets, "What? You... son of a..."  
  
The creature released its grip on the Cook, and Adrian fell silent. I felt a rush of cold wind blow me and the Cook backward, and then we were back on the restaurant floor. The door to the basement was shut tight, but I still couldn't escape that dreadful feeling brewing in my stomach. What the hell did I just make a deal with?  
  
I brushed myself off and leaned the Cook against the back of the door to the basement. Self preservation and all that. As I propped up his unconscious body, I noticed the two knives I stole from him were laying on the ground in perfect condition. I put them back in the suitcase thing exactly as they were. He'd never know.  
  
I decided then that I had had enough of work that day, called the owner, let him know that the problem was taken care of and he'd need to hire another temp, and clocked out. I headed out the back door, only to see Adrian's formless apparition manifesting in front of with his arms folded.   
  
"...bitch."   
  
I gave him an awkward smile and shrugged, "Company policy."  
  
"Fuck you and the high horse you rode in on. I'm stuck here forever now! You know the rules good and damn well Marceline."  
  
It was true. I did. Which is exactly why I chose to ignore him screaming at me from the property line as I got in my car and drove off. I'll happily listen to him complain about his soul being eternally bound to the restaurant tomorrow, but my day was long and I was extremely tired.  
  
Honestly though, it wasn't a bad day at work.
