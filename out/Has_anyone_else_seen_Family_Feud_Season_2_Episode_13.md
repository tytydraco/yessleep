Hello everyone I'm a frequent lurker on this sub. I'm interested in the paranormal but I'll admit I'm a bit of a skeptic. Even so, I saw something weird one night several years ago that I pushed to the back of my mind until a few nights ago. I got a craving for watching some good ole family feud and it's always on past a certain time so I put it on. There were about 10 or so minutes until the next hour so I just waited for the next episode to come on.

It started out normal, the theme music began to play then the intro began. Then popular television personality, actor, comedian, author, television host, and purveyor of the finest and most lavish suits known to man, Steve Harvey was joyfully introduced as the camera zoomed in to catch his grand entrance.

Steve silently walked onstage to the theme song brightly blaring over visuals of the cheering and clapping audience. He slowly seemed to mentally drag himself over and stand in between the dual podiums as I started to hear soft noises of confusion coming from the crowd. I was also confused, this wasn't how the show usually started or looked at all and something seemed to be really wrong with Steve. I could feel something when I looked at him but I couldn't pinpoint what the feeling was. While the theme music and noise from the audience died down, Steve stood perfectly still looking down at his shoes as if in shame. He stood there for what felt like an eternity in complete silences as everyone including me stared at him, waiting for him to speak.

I faintly heard something small and metallic hit the floor somewhere off screen. It was so quiet I thought the audience were holding their breath. After what felt like hours I noticed my house was completely silent too. The lack of noise felt tight, like my whole being was getting squeezed by something. After another while of an unknown amount of time, Steve finally started to raise his head. When the camera zoomed in close enough for me to see his eyes, they looked as if he'd been crying. He was just standing there, almost perfectly still but I noticed an ongoing slight twitch in his shoulders. He stood there twitching and looking like he was holding back tears for a bit then finally opened his mouth as if to speak. I could hear a faint ruffle go around the room as the crowd leaned in to hear what he was about to say.

He sat frozen in that pose for a few minutes before I noticed out of the corner of my eye a tiny glitch on the bottom right side of the screen. Steve took a breath to speak. At this point I noticed something in his eyes and suddenly realized what I felt before when I looked directly at him. It was fear. At first I thought he looked sad but I couldnt mistake the glint of anger i noticed flashing in his eyes. Finally I begin to hear the crackle of his voice starting when the camera suddenly zoomed back out. The Family Feud theme song abruptly jolted back on, seemingly louder than the first time it played.

The contestants started coming out, cheering and clapping, to a confused and visibly shaken audience. I looked back over and saw Steve's mouth was now closed and he looked normal again except for the fact that he wasnt clapping or smiling like everyone else. The contestants started to look around in confusion, some mouthing things to off camera crew while still clapping and trying to keep the slightest ounce of a facade of cheerfulness. A few of them started to gesture "what's going on" to off camera crew and one person started approaching Steve.

It was near chaos by this point, everyone was confused and asking questions. The contestants had all stopped clapping and were waving off camera, gesturing for instructions on what to do. The camera zoomed back in on Steve still standing in the same spot almost-perfectly still. I caught the same glint of anger again but this time his eyes had welled up and he looked like he was holding back tears. A twitch so slight I barely noticed it started in his right arm as the contestant who had been trying to get his attention standing right beside him reached out to tap him on his shoulder. The whole time since Steve first looked up, he hadn't broken eyes with the camera. Again he started to open his mouth right as the tip of the contestant's finger made contact with his shoulder.

Everyone froze in place as the camera zoomed back out. Then they all dropped their arms to their sides and stood perfectly still, facing the direction they were facing when they froze. The credits started to roll. I sat perfectly still, my mind running a mile a minute, watching the credits rolling over the video image of every person in the auditorium standing perfectly still in that suffocating silence that had seemed to come back over the world. I didn't know how long I had been sitting there but the credits just kept rolling and rolling. I felt glued to the screen, I wanted to know what Steve was going to say. It felt like something important and we were left on a cliffhanger. I noticed the credits started to list different occupations beside the names. Occupations outside of the film industry and eventually some I have never heard of. I kept watching.

The cast all continued to stand perfectly still except for a very slight twitch I detected rippling through the crowd. I started to notice a strange feeling in the tip of my index finger, almost like movement under the skin right as the screen abruptly cut to a closeup of a man's veiny muscular arm slapping the side of a large full water tank with a hole puncture in the center pouring water out. He pulled his arm away to reveal a large cut of thick, clear tape on the tank which stopped the leak. I turned the tv off and noticed I was standing up.

At the time I asked family and friends if they had seen that episode and nobody knew what I was talking about. I googled it only to find it not listed anywhere at all. No mention of it anywhere except for the 1977 version but this was hosted by Steve Harvey. I looked up the tv guide from that night and a different episode was listed. After a while of not being able to crack the case, I eventually forgot about the incident until a few nights ago when I decided to watch some good ole fashioned Family Feud. Cure the itch.

Everything was normal. Steve was cracking jokes, the audience was roaring with laughter. The families gave silly answers, I yelled at the tv a couple of times, normal good and fun times watching Family Feud. But right before the final winning family did the final two person round, I noticed a slight twitch in Steve Harvey's right arm and the memory flooded back over me like a firm, silent cloud. Squeezing me, so I turned off the tv. Again, finding myself standing up.

This freaked me out so bad I made an account to ask you guys if anyone else has seen that episode or noticed the twitch? Have you felt that feeling in your finger? I think I can still feel it now and I have an appointment scheduled for later this week to get my ears checked out because everything is starting to sound quieter. If anyone knows what's happening please let me know!
