I don’t know how long I was in the coffin before I realized something wasn’t right.

I mean, obviously something was wrong. I was buried. There was no light, no room to move, and every breath felt like it was being recycled straight back into my lungs. My heartbeat was so loud I thought it might crack my ribs. That part made sense. Panic is predictable.

What didn’t make sense was that I never passed out.

I screamed until my throat burned raw, until my voice collapsed into this wet, useless rasp that bounced back at me from the satin lined walls. I punched until my knuckles split and the pain dulled into something distant and unimportant.

Still conscious. Still thinking.

My lungs never fully gave in. My vision never faded. Time felt stretched. Wrong. Like it wasn’t moving forward so much as pooling around me.

The air smelled used. Stale. Like it had already been breathed too many times. The walls felt closer, or maybe I was swelling. It was hard to tell where my body ended anymore.

Then I heard breathing.

It was faint, almost lost under my own pulse, but it wasn’t mine.

Slow. Careful. Right next to my ear.

I froze.

The breathing stopped.

Something shifted behind me. The satin wrinkled. I felt a presence curl closer, close enough that I should have felt warmth, but there was none. Just cold seeping into my spine.

A mouth moved near my ear.

“You’re not finished,” it whispered.

The voice was mine.

Not just similar. Exactly how I sound inside my head when I think.

I tried to thrash, but my body felt delayed, like I was moving through syrup, or remembering movement instead of actually doing it.

Cold fingers traced the back of my neck.

“You felt it, didn’t you?” it said. “That moment. The space between impact and nothing.”

And suddenly I remembered. Headlights in the rain. A horn blaring. That split second where time cracked open and everything slowed.

“I didn’t die,” I whispered.

It chuckled softly. “No. You hesitated.”

The coffin shuddered.

Then, violently, the lid opened.

Light slammed into my eyes. I gasped out of pure reflex and choked. Not because I needed air, just because my body expected to.

There was a funeral happening.

My funeral.

I was standing beside the casket.

No one noticed me. The priest was mid sentence, droning calmly. My mother was crying quietly. My sister’s hands were clenched so tightly her knuckles were white.

And inside the casket was my body.

Gray skin. Blue lips. A cut along my temple I don’t remember getting. Dried blood in my hair. My chest wasn’t moving.

I stumbled back and looked down at my hands.

They were translucent. Not gone, exactly. Just thinning at the edges, like breath on glass.

Then the thing from the coffin stood up.

It stepped out of my body like someone shrugging off a coat.

Up close, it was wrong in ways I couldn’t immediately explain. It had my face, but it fit too tightly. Its eyes blinked out of sync. When it smiled, the expression lingered a moment too long.

It adjusted my jacket and exhaled.

“Oh, that’s better,” it said.

I backed away. “What are you?”

It tilted its head, studying me. “I’m what happens when someone doesn’t finish dying. I’m here to keep you *company*.”

For a split second, the chapel flickered.

The walls rotted away, revealing darkness behind them. Coffins stacked like shelves. Rows and rows of them. Every one shaking softly, like something alive inside.

Then everything snapped back.

No one else reacted.

“You slipped,” it continued, like we were having a normal conversation. “Most people let go. You didn’t.”

“I didn’t choose this.”

“No,” it agreed. “But now you’re here.”

The priest announced it was time for final prayers.

The thing stepped back into my body.

I fell, or was pulled, and hit something solid. Hands wrapped around my ankles and dragged me toward the casket. I slammed my fists against the lid until my knuckles broke and bled. I screamed, but no sound came out.

The air thickened. Whispers swirled around me.

Finish it. You can’t escape. Daniel.

I looked up. The priest stood above me, lips moving calmly. “May he finally find rest.”

How can I rest if I’m not dead?

The coffin pressed down on me, shifting, alive. Something whispered behind my eyes. You should have left mortality. Now you belong to us.

That’s when I realized this wasn’t the end.

It was the beginning.

Every funeral after that fed it. Every tear, every memory, every whispered story about me made it stronger.

I wasn’t allowed to live.

I wasn’t allowed to die.

The coffin slammed shut.

Then opened again.

And again.

Each time, I was at another funeral. Different chapel. Different faces. But the name was always mine. The dates changed. Years passed.

I watched my parents age. I watched my sister stop crying and start smiling again. I watched strangers talk about me like a half remembered story.

Sometimes, someone in the crowd would stare at me too long.

Sometimes, they would flinch, like they almost saw me.

Once, a little boy looked straight at me and whispered, “Why is he still here?”

No one answered him.

Between funerals, I faded. My thoughts blurred. My memories felt borrowed. I forgot what my real voice sounded like.

The last funeral was different.

Smaller. Quieter.

The name on the program wasn’t mine.

But I was in the casket.

That’s when I understood.

People who don’t fully die leave a vacancy.

Something has to fill it.

As the lid closed, I realized the worst part was never my funeral.

It’s that someday, you might attend yours.

And when you do, you might wake up in the space between life and death.

And find you need someone to keep you company.
