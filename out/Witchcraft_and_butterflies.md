“You should never use witchcraft, darling.”

My mother said it the same way she said everything else that scared her: softly, urgently, like fear itself might be listening. Being a Christian only amplified her paranoia. She truly believed that if I paid some so-called witch for her services, demons would find a way into me.

I regretted telling my parents about my plans as I sat at their table, absently stirring the soup my mother had invited me over to eat.

“Oh, don’t be so paranoid, honey,” my father said, rolling his eyes.

He never shared my mother’s beliefs. Nonetheless, he was also skeptical about me visiting the witch, only for another reason.

“The single bad thing that woman will do is scam you out of your money. Absolute waste. Useless spending.”

After several failed attempts to explain myself, I gave up. I let them believe whatever they wanted and left shortly after.

I never had a definitive belief about these things, being more of an agnostic, but I had to try everything; and if I didn’t try some magic, I haven’t tried it all.

The witch lived at the edge of the city, where the streets grew narrower and quieter. Standing in front of her door, my anxiety crept in. Did my mother’s words actually have a subconscious impact on me? This is ridiculous, there are no demons, no black spells. If this does work, the witch will only help me in exchange for money, just as any other business works. She has no interest in cursing me, only in being paid

A couple of minutes passed in front of the witch’s door, while I was reminding myself why I needed to try this. I wanted a family so badly, but at thirty-four I still hadn’t found a man that could be a good husband and father. All the men I met were actually immature boys, cheaters, liars, and so on. My biological clock was ticking so loudly, it was deafening me.

If stories were to be believed, this woman had helped others like me.

Maybe she could help me too.

I tried meeting my future husband through friends, through work, social media, dating apps, pubs, events, all you can think of, and there were no available decent guys anywhere. At this point, I guess only magic could help.

Half hour later, I leave the witch’s home. She muttered words I didn’t understand, burned dried herbs that filled the room with thick smoke, and traced strange symbols on my palms with cold fingers. I assumed it was all for show. The performance wasn’t cheap for sure, but it left me cold. I left that place the same way I walked in, only a few dollars short, nothing magical was happening, no new perspective on life. I was feeling the same empty space in my heart, where my family was supposed to be. What a waste of time.

The snow had started falling harder by the time I headed back to my apartment. The streets were slick and nearly empty. My thoughts were spiraling.

I slipped on the icy ground and would have definitely broken something, if it weren’t for a hand grabbing me from behind.

“Careful,” a man said. “This snow is no joke. I haven’t seen a storm like this since childhood.”

The kind man that saved my bones from potentially breaking was handsome, with warm eyes and a calm, reassuring voice. I laughed nervously, thanked him, and we started small talk. The small talk led to exchanging social media, which led to more talking. The more we talked, the more amazing he seemed. Without realizing it, he was already growing butterflies in my stomach.

His name was Paul.

Two months later, I brought him to my parents’ house. It was the first time they truly approved of someone I was dating. He was polite without trying too hard, attentive, patient. Things were going great, I could see myself finally settling down, having a child, the dream.

Outside, the snow kept falling. That winter was strange. Snow had started in November and refused to leave. Storm after storm, heavier than anything we’d seen in years.

Paul had to leave, as he was waking up early in the morning and needed to get some sleep, so he drove off and left me at my parents’ house, who insisted I shouldn’t get out in that snow and just sleep there for the night. That was of course my mother being paranoid again. I gave in to her pressure and continued the night sharing with my parents details about my relationship with Paul. Among others, I also shared how amazed I am at the fact that I met Paul right after exiting the witch’s house and how it seems that the magic actually did work.

“That’s crazy talk, dear! It was obviously a coincidence. You would have surely met Paul that day with or without the witch’s existence.”

My dad could not believe in the supernatural even if it hit him in the face.

“Actually, honey, I don’t think she would have met Paul without the witch. Think about it. She met Paul while leaving the witch’s home, if she hadn’t gone there, she might have never crossed paths with him. It is the butterfly effect. If one small event is changed, nothing else remains the same.”

I could see my father seriously reflecting on my mom’s words.

“That doesn’t mean witchcraft did anything,” he said. “The butterfly effect is science. No magic involved.”

While my parents were discussing butterflies changing destinies, my phone rang. It was late and this was unusual. The number was unknown. I nervously answered. As I was listening to the voice on the other end of the line, my stomach dropped. My knees weakened. My chest tightened. My world shattered.

At the funeral, my parents never left my side. I blamed myself endlessly. I should have insisted Paul stay. I should have made him wait until morning.

But deep down, I knew it wasn’t just that.

If I hadn’t gone to the witch, I wouldn’t have met Paul.

If I hadn’t met Paul, he wouldn’t have been at my parents’ house.

If he hadn’t been there, he wouldn’t have driven home that night in the snow.

He would still be alive.

And I wouldn’t have lost the love of my life.

It was the butterfly effect.

My mother was right about everything.

I should have never used witchcraft.
