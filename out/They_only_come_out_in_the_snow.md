**they already know who i am and where i am so i have nothing to lose i know i am going to die soon, My name is Mathew Asphalt and i live in Canada, (woody point), Newfoundland. And they found me they know I've been watching them, they know I've been researching them, studying them, Now they are doing the same to me they are watching me i can feel them, i can see them in the shadowy corners of my hallways and my bedroom, they study the way i act, they know i can see them and i know they can see me, some nights they wander the halls, does anyone else in the area i live in also here the creaks? the laughter? the sound and feeling of heavy, laboured breathing on their neck every single time they try and go to sleep? Its become natural all of these noises and feelings, but they are never ever spotted when the snow is gone, i call them snow lurkers. i have grown to adapt to the late night laughter, it just tells me more for my studies i have a whole journal full of entries about them i'll write a few of my favourite entries:**

Every word i write it's coming closer.**

**I've not written in over 5 months because its been watching me so often but i watched it walk around 1000 yards further than it usually does, i can tell because i still see him very faintly he's not moving toward me but further away? hes found a new victim i suppose, the laughing one the deformed one its back but its not laughing its just staring at me?**

**it's behind me.**

**Hello, i'm detective Jason Rieves this is the diary of Mathew Asphalt this man recently went missing and people are assuming he was going insane and just ran away to kill himself or something, But as i was the first person to read the diary transcription i see them now he passed them onto me, he was not going insane but he was going through a deeply traumatic experience and most like got killed while trying to get more details and evidence to prove his "theory's" as true. Although he  never went into detail about these creatures, there are 8 i have names for them i call one the giggler, this one is the one that laughs and looks deformed like a zombie but its face is young like a toddlers face, but it's got around 100 teeth, Another is one that wasn't written in the transcription i call it the screamer it's got long hair no eyes and screams all night long, i have not slept in 1 week 6 days 5 hours and 37 seconds because of it,the tall one i call him long lurker he is 25 feet tall and his neck is bent out of shape completely he has no eyes so i don't actually know how he can see me but he can and he can see me so often that as i'm typing this into reddit i hear him behind me i'm acting unfased but he knows i feel him he knows i'm scared. I'm not going to describe the others because they come closer and corner me when i try and type about them, I've tried so many times.**

**I'm writing this because when you are finished reading this transcription even without the snow you will get them next, IGNORE THE BREATHING, i know you have started to feel and hear breathing just ignore it, it's going to go away in the next 30 seconds, keep your breathing level and steady they'll hurt you and let me tell you it hurts long story short i'm missing an eye, don't look behind you that's not who the impersonater says it is ignore that too, the breathing is gone that's good.  i'm sorry to leave you with this but i was going insane. I'm free now, Goodbye.**

**Detective. Jason Rieves**

**P.S ignore all the sounds and people talking the whispers and laughs don't move, it's NOT REAL AT ALL.**
