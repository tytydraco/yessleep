Before you judge us, I need you to understand that we only did what we did because we believed that we could save lives. That was the idea behind all of this. That was why we did what we did.

&#x200B;

We believed that we could save lives.

&#x200B;

We just… we made mistakes.

&#x200B;

They say that those who can’t do, teach. While I don’t think it was true that I wasn’t a capable neurologist, I still ended up as a teacher. I had a good salary. I worked at a premiere university and I told myself every day that I was teaching the next generation how to save lives. That was worth something, right?

&#x200B;

Still, I suppose there was a bit of a yearning to get back out there. There is something special about actually being able to help people. I suppose if I really wanted to, I could have taken up a position at a hospital as an in house consultant. But I never pushed for it. Maybe I was just waiting for it to come to me.

&#x200B;

What did come knocking on my door wasn’t a consultant position, but it was arguably just as juicy. Legally I can’t tell you the name of the company that hired me. But I can say that they were a subsidiary of a large pharmaceutical company based out of China.

&#x200B;

Their pitch was… Well, it was a little absurd. I needed to sign an NDA just to hear it and even then, I had questions about the legality of it all. The company had recently developed an interest in human cloning experiments. Nothing outlandish like creating body doubles or anything like that. Their interests were more grounded. Cloning specific pieces of human tissue. Hearts, livers, kidneys. The idea would be to clone healthy organs and body parts for people and use them to replace damaged, dying or infected organs. We would just be cloning the specific parts of the body as opposed to trying to clone entire people and harvesting them for their parts. It sounded ethical and honestly, kind of ingenious.

&#x200B;

I did take some time to think it over. But I think I knew early on that my answer was going to be yes. It wasn’t just the generous pay they offered. It was the chance to really make a difference! The chance to save peoples lives! That was all I ever wanted to do… I wanted to save people.

&#x200B;

Our team was fairly small. Our benefactors assured us we could have more people if we needed them, but what we had was fairly sufficient for a start. There were six of us, not counting the technicians that assisted us.

&#x200B;

Dr. Zhao was the project lead. He was a representative of our benefactors and a capable geneticist in his own right. I always quite liked Zhao. He was grounded, focused and for the most part he seemed transparent. He was accompanied by Dr. Smith and Dr. Dean, who shared his field. Both were wonderful people. Smith was a shy and quiet man with a gentle smile while Dean was loud and boisterous but brilliant.

&#x200B;

Dr. Thompson was our resident Biologist. As the only other woman on the team, she and I spent a lot of time together. She broke a few rules in telling me of her work outside the project, and in my free time I looked her up. Even before this project she should have earned a nobel prize for her work. Thompson could have easily been one of the greats of her field. My main associate was Dr. Jacobi, a Cardiologist. While I spent the most time with Dr. Thompson, Jacobi was more of my equal. He was a soft spoken and serious man, but I found that I liked that about him.

&#x200B;

Our Arizona facility was off the beaten path, several miles outside of the nearest city and at the end of a dirt road that led into the Mojave Desert. It seemed like the perfect place to do our research in relative peace.

&#x200B;

Strictly speaking, human cloning is not illegal in Arizona so long as it is not publicly funded. Our research was funded by a private think tank and otherwise kept under the radar so as not to stir up a controversy. Controversy was inevitable with this kind of work, yes. But none of us cared. We were all in it for the thrill of discovery and the promised reward of a medical breakthrough.

&#x200B;

Outside of the team, we had a staff of roughly 30 assistant researchers and techs. We had everything we needed to succeed and we intended to do just that.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Our first several weeks were spent debating just how to begin. We researched all we could on existing animal clones - a subject Dr. Zhao was incredibly well versed on. He’d been involved with a few similar projects before.

&#x200B;

I think that people fail to realize how common cloning has become. It’s been done countless times. But what we were attempting to do had never actually been done before. Not on record at least.

&#x200B;

As we discussed, a plan of sorts came together. We came up with the idea of gestating a fetus in an artificial uterus. Then we could isolate certain organs and try to grow them independent of the fetus.

&#x200B;

There were a few ethical questions raised immediately of course. What we were attempting to do was effectively harvesting the organs of an unborn child. Dr. Smith was quick to point out that there could be significant backlash down the line if we went that route.

&#x200B;

Our answer to the problem was… Well, a little unconventional.

&#x200B;

In the end, we decided to gestate the fetus. But we’d do things a little differently. We’d bring one of them to term and observe it as it grew. The hypothesis was that a cloned child born of an artificial uterus wouldn’t be able to survive for long! But we had the means to know for sure… All we needed was the cells and those came from an unlikely place.

&#x200B;

I didn’t believe who the donor was when Zhao told us. Neither did anyone else.

“Tom Hanks?” Dr. Jacobi asked, a little dumbfounded, “You’re telling us we have cells from the actual Tom Hanks.”

“We have cells from all sorts of public figures.” Zhao replied calmly. He sat on his chair in our meeting room casually, “They are some of the high level donors to our campaign. It would seem that Mr. Hanks is among those donors.”

“Who else do we have?” I asked. I knew that some of our research was backed by charitable donations. I just hadn’t guessed it had come from Hollywood of all places.

“What? You don’t like Tom Hanks?” Jacobi teased. Zhao ignored him and kept speaking.“Of our notable donors… Nicolas Cage, Oprah Winfrey, Johnny Depp…”“Alright, we’re doing Nick Cage,” Dean interjected. “I mean… come on, we’ve *got to!”*

&#x200B;

“We’re talking about the first human clone here, and you want it to be of Nicolas Cage?” Dr. Thomas asked, absolutely deadpan. “Can I just veto that? Is anyone else with me here? If the fetus survives gestation, we’ll have to deal with an actual baby celebrity. I think I’d rather deal with Tom Hanks than anyone else.” She looked over at me, as if hoping I’d back her up.

“I think that going with Tom Hanks sample would be the safer route.” I said, “He’s a less… divisive public figure.”

“So is Oprah.” Dean said, scoffing, “Christ, can you imagine…”

“Does it matter which sample we use?” Dr. Smith asked, and looked to Zhao, “What exactly did the company promise these people in exchange for donations?”

“Early access to the program.” Zhao admitted, “Although we have enough cells to run multiple tests.”

“So you’re telling me that we could clone an army of Nick Cage’s, and nobody could stop us?” Dean asked. Nobody dignified that with a response.

“Maybe we should just choose the samples at random,” Smith suggested. “They’re all viable right? If the fetus gestates then it doesn’t matter who we’ve cloned. We’ll be running the same tests no matter what and it lets us move on from this conversation.”

&#x200B;

Dr. Dean’s smile faded ever so slightly.

“I mean we could… although I vote that we restrict it to the celebrity donors only! It’ll make for one hell of a story once we publish the papers!”

Even Dr. Thomas cracked a smile at that.

“First human clone and it’s fucking Oprah…” She said under her breath, “Human history, how you fail to disappoint…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As Dr. Smith had suggested, we chose the samples at random and gestated three fetuses at once. It was only when all three were confirmed to have taken and were growing that we looked to see who we’d gotten. Our three clones were Oprah Winfrey, Guy Fieri and Tom Hanks. We voted on which one we would allow to mature, and Tom Hanks won (much to Dean’s chagrin. He had been fervently campaigning for Guy Fieri.)

&#x200B;

We separated the Tom Hanks clone from the others and continued to monitor the other two.

&#x200B;

At fifteen weeks, we decided that it was time to see if we could harvest Oprah Winfrey's organs and in that endeavor, we had quite a bit of success. We were able to kill the fetus without halting the development of the organs, allowing them to grow independently.  I was tasked with analyzing the brain, while Thompson and Jacobi were set to study the viability of the rest of the organs.

&#x200B;

Already I was seeing a few potential applications. My theory was that we could use some cloned brain tissue to repair severe brain damage. My theory would need to be extensively tested of course, but if it proved correct it could mark a drastic leap forward in our ability to both help patients with extreme head injuries and repair other types of brain damage.

&#x200B;

I put in a request with Dr. Zhao to permit us to clone a second Oprah for me to run some experiments.

&#x200B;

Our results with the Guy Fieri clone were similar. We killed the fetus at 20 weeks, and Dr. Thompson later told me that she felt we’d done it too late. As we spoke about cloning more fetuses, we concluded that 15 weeks was an ideal gestation period.

&#x200B;

As for our Tom Hanks clone however… he continued to grow at a normal rate. By the time he reached term and we removed him from the artificial uterus, he seemed almost like a healthy baby boy. We hired a discreet pediatrician to examine him and he found no defects. This was both good news, and highly troubling.

&#x200B;

It seemed that we were on the right track. We were producing viable embryos and our clone was for all intents and purposes, completely healthy. But if a fetus we cloned could come out as a fairly normal infant, then the ethical concerns from before made an ugly return. People would not take kindly to the notion that we were killing the unborn and harvesting their organs.

&#x200B;

While Dr. Zhao argued that our benefits outweighed the cost - the rest of us were able to convince him to find ways to attempt to eliminate those ethical concerns with our work.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

As we poured months, weeks, and even years into our research, our clone grew from a baby into a child.

&#x200B;

Tom Jr, as we’d taken to calling him lived in our facility. In a sense, we were all his parents. Dr. Thompson took on the unofficial role of Tom’s Mother and kept him at her place. She was the one who first noticed the abnormalities.

&#x200B;

While Tom Jr. was for all intents and purposes any healthy and fairly normal little boy, we quickly noticed a quirk about him.

&#x200B;

He was aging rapidly. Nothing wildly dramatic. But it was noticeable. By the time of his first birthday, he was almost as developed as a three year old and we weren’t entirely sure why.

“It could be progeria.” Dr. Smith said during a meeting we had on the subject.

“Then why didn’t we pick it up sooner?” Dr. Jacobi responded, “Michelle’s been taking care of him.

We’ve had that pediatrician checking him out. One of them would’ve caught it.”

“I’ve been there every step of the way.” Dr. Thompson confirmed, “This isn’t progeria. Besides, Tom Jr. has no other symptoms, and as far as I know his donor has no history of it.”

“That we know of.” Dr. Smith said softly, “I don’t exactly think we can ask Tom Hanks ourselves.”

&#x200B;

There was a moment of silence before Dr. Dean chimed in.

“What about the artificial uterus?” He asked, “Maybe that had some sort of effect on him? Dr. Thompson, you helped design those, right?”

“Yes, Dr. Zhao and I worked together on them. But they’re entirely synthetic!” She said.

“Yeah but what about the amniotic fluid?” Dean asked, “That wasn’t synthetic, what about the egg cell?”

&#x200B;

“The egg cell was donated by me.” I said, drawing some attention. I hadn’t discussed it with my colleagues before, although I had donated the eggs for several of the early experiments.

“You? We couldn’t have gotten a donor like we did for the cells?” Dean asked.“We’ve been using external donors since, but both Dr. Thompson and Dr. Saunders contributed to our first tests.” Dr. Zhao said. He’d been quiet up until then, “We would have needed to wait weeks if not months for our benefactors to requisition egg samples. This was the fastest way. As for the amniotic fluid we used samples from a Lion.”

“I’m sorry… from a lion?” Dean asked, “We grew a *baby* in *lion juice?*”“That’s an exceedingly stupid way to put it… but, yes,” Zhao said. “We needed mammalian amniotic fluid and that was what we were able to get. If there were any adverse effects, we would have discontinued using it!”

“Tom Hanks Jr. is aging at about three times the rate he should be! I’d call that an adverse effect!”“We’re assuming it’s because of the amniotic fluid. It may not be.” Zhao replied, “Look… Let’s not loose our heads here. We can’t draw any solid conclusions just yet, so let’s see how Tom Jr. develops.”

&#x200B;

Dr. Dean pursed his lips but finally sighed.

“Fine… but we need to monitor him more closely. I want to look at a blood sample myself and run some tests on it.”“He doesn’t really like blood tests…” Dr. Thompson said.“Right now, I don’t care what he likes. I want to know what’s wrong with him!” Dean replied harshly. He quickly settled down again, “I’m sorry. But maybe there’s a chance we can fix him. That’s what I want to know. We owe it to ourselves to do that.”

&#x200B;

Dr. Thompson nodded in quiet agreement.“I suppose so… Alright, stop by the house tonight. We’ll take a look at him.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dr. Dean’s blood test yielded no results and Tom Jr. continued to grow. We found no explanation for his abnormal development and he didn’t seem bothered by it. Months continued to go by as we watched him but sooner or no answer ever presented itself to our questions.

&#x200B;

By his second birthday, Tom Jr was a healthy and seemingly happy child. Every day he came to the lab with Dr. Thompson and would run around entertaining himself as we worked. He was a sweet kid who took on the reputed kind demeanor of his namesake quickly. A google search revealed that he looked exactly like his donor and I was even starting to hear a little bit of Sheriff Woody in his voice.

&#x200B;

“Am I going to work here one day?” He asked me once. I was on my laptop, analyzing the brainwaves of an independently gestated brain.

&#x200B;

“Hopefully, kiddo!” I replied, “You just need to grow up and go to a good school first if you want to do what we do. But you’ll always have a place with us here. We need you!”

“You need me?” He asked, and then grinned, “You need me!”“Yes we do. You’re helping us save a lot of people. So you’re a little hero, aren’t you?”

“Am I?” His eyes lit up.

“Absolutely. No matter what, you’re always gonna be our little hero, Tom.”

&#x200B;

I tousled his hair and closed out my program to bring up a game for us to play together. I deserved a break after all.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

As the third and fourth year rolled by, Tom Jr. continued to grow into a teenager. His voice deepened. His face became more familiar. I thought that maybe I even saw my own green eyes in his, although maybe that was just wishful thinking.

&#x200B;

But he never lost his youthful energy. Tom wanted more than anything to work with us and we let him help wherever we could. Our work progressed slowly towards a breakthrough. We had managed to grow independent living organs that would probably be less ethically dubious. Our most recent project to clone Dr. Dean’s lungs had been a resounding success and on the heels of some successes with cloning the heart of Taylor Swift and the liver of Anthony Hopkins, which we did not eat despite Dr. Dean making a lot of inappropriate jokes about it.

&#x200B;

Tom was with us for every success, cheering and clapping. Although his joy started to seem a little more hollow.

&#x200B;

We opened some champagne for the success of the Lung experiment and as we toasted each other, I saw Tom Jr. standing in the corner and wearing an empty smile.“Something wrong?” I asked, going towards him with a glass in hand. I didn’t offer him any to drink of course! He was 4 years old!“Oh, I’m fine!” He assured me.

“Tom…”

&#x200B;

His smile faded.

“Well. I guess I’ve just been thinking lately, that’s all. I… I’ve been here my entire life, right?”

“Of course.” I replied.“Well…” Tom sighed and shook his head before steeling himself to ask, “Lisa, am I a… am I real?”

&#x200B;

We’d all been dreading this question. But we’d known it would come.

I’d known it would come.

“Of course you’re real!” I said, “You’re here. You’re alive.”

“But am I… Did you make me? Please, just tell me the truth.”

&#x200B;

It took me a few moments to answer. But I had no choice.

“You… we ran some early experiments.” I was trying to choose my words carefully, “We used donated cells on some early clones and… yes, we let one reach maturity. That one grew into you. But I can promise you, that doesn’t make you any less real, Tom. You’re still like a son to everyone here… you’re my son.”

His eyes met mine.

“What?”“The… The cloning process required a cell and an egg donor. The cells came from an actor named Tom Hanks. You remember Woody from Toy Story?”

&#x200B;

He loved that movie.“I’m a clone of Sheriff Woody?” He asked.

“His voice actor. But the other donation came from me. In a sense, you are my son.”

“What about Mom?” He asked, looking to Dr. Thompson behind me.“Michelle… she was in a better position to raise a child than I was. We agreed she could provide the best level of care for you… but you’re a son to all of us, Tom. You’re a son to me. We love you. *I* love you, and you are just as human as we are.”

&#x200B;

He blinked slowly then nodded.

“R-right…” He said softly, “You need me, right?”

“We need you.” I promised him, and gestured to the other five scientists behind me.“All of this. It came from you, Tom. We never could have done any of it without you. You showed us that cloned organisms were viable and sentient! You made us refine our methods to be more ethical! You are the bedrock of our success here. And by being that, you’ve already changed the world.”

&#x200B;

Tom looked at the others in silence.

“You should be proud of who you are.” I told him, “Come on. We’re going out to dinner. You should join us.”

I took his hand and I led him back to join the others.

&#x200B;

That evening, we celebrated our success. Our work was forgotten for the time being as we treated ourselves to dinner. There were a few drinks but not many.

&#x200B;

Tom was quiet throughout the evening, but none of us seemed to notice as instead we discussed the way we’d publish our findings. We were eager to share our results with the world! Why wouldn’t we be? What we’d accomplished could have saved millions of lives!

&#x200B;

It was everything we’d hoped for.

It was all worth it.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

The next morning, I got a call from Dr. Zhao.

“Dr. Thompson is bringing Tom to the lab.” He said, “We need you down here immediately. Something’s happening.”

&#x200B;

He hung up before he could give me any details. My immediate fear was that a new health condition had developed. Had Tom Jr. had a seizure? Was he sick? What was going on? I left my small apartment and sped towards the lab, unsure of what awaited me. Dr. Zhao was already there when I arrived and he led me through the lab towards the medical bay we’d set up for some animal trials we’d run.

&#x200B;

The others were already there in front of some… thing. It was about the size of a person. It had a pale fleshy color and looked like a blob of flesh.

“Where’s Tom?” I asked.“Right here.” Dean replied, staring down at the mass of flesh, “Dr. Thompson found him like this, this morning…”

&#x200B;

I looked over at her. A hand was pressed anxiously against her mouth and she looked ready to cry.

“He’s still alive.” Dr. Jacobi offered, “I’m still detecting a heartbeat. I was hoping you might be able to determine if he’s conscious in there. We’re getting ready to run an ultrasound, but I… I don’t know what the hell this is… I’m not even entirely sure where to start with something like this!”

“This isn’t possible.” Dr. Thompson said under her breath, “Human beings don’t just… *they don’t just undergo a metamorphosis like this!* Its… It’s almost like a pupae.”“Like a caterpillar?” I asked. Dr. Thompson nodded.“Yes. But… That’s not possible. And Tom was fine last night! He asked me a bit about where he came from but… he was fine! His vitals were fine during our last checkup…”“He’s pretty clearly not fine, Lisa!” Dr. Smith snapped, “Jacobi, where’s the technician? We need to get on this?”“Right, right… They’re on their way.” Jacobi said under his breath, “I’ll let you know what I find.”“There’s nothing to be gained by standing around here.”  Zhao said, “The rest of us should meet in the boardroom and try to understand what just happened.”

&#x200B;

No argument there. That came later.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

“If he were completely human, he wouldn’t be in a fucking pupa!” Was Dr. Smith’s argument. All of our squabbling from before was immediately silenced. Smith’s eyes settled on Zhao.

“So. Either there was one hell of a mistake, or there’s something you’re not telling us.”

Dr. Zhao shifted in his seat. He stared at Dr. Smith before finally sighing.

“There… may have been some misinformation about how we got the samples.” He admitted.  Smith threw up his hands.

“Oh? *REALLY?* And pray tell what was that? Enlighten us, Dr. Zhao!”“This project was… repurposed,” Zhao said. “We aren’t the first to attempt doing this. Odds are we will not be the last either if we fail. Don’t ask me about our predecessors… I don’t know much about them. All I know is that they were with a company our benefactors had bought out and that their version of this project was stagnating. The samples that we originally used came from them, but they’d made only a small amount of progress before they ran out of funding. Nothing compared to what we’ve done here. But our company saw the potential of this project! They wanted to bring some fresh minds in, and part of my job was to ensure that we didn’t make the same mistakes our predecessors did!”

&#x200B;

“Mistakes?” Dr. Thompson asked, “What are you talking about?”

“The other team went… well, tried to take shortcuts. They wanted faster results. They modified some of the samples with some kind of genome they’d extracted from some species of stag beetle. Their theory was that it would make individually grown organs grow faster… although since they weren’t using an in utero method like ours, they never got very far with it."

“I’m sorry… they *modified* samples?” Dean asked.

“With no success!” Zhao corrected, “They failed”

“But you still said we used their samples,” I said. “That’s what you’re telling us, right? That when we adopted the project, we were using their samples?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Zhao hesitated for a moment before nodding.

“And you didn’t think that we should have been told about this?” I asked. “You didn’t *dispose* of the modified samples?”

“I was under the impression that we had!” Dr. Zhao argued, “And as for why I never told you - I had no reason to think that it was relevant! I had no idea that any of the modified samples had slipped through!”

“It became relevant the moment Tom started aging!” Thompson snapped. “You should have brought this to our attention years ago!”

“I had no idea we were working with contaminated cells!” Dr. Zhao replied, his tone defensive “This is just as much of a surprise to me as it is to you!”

“We need to terminate the project…” Dr. Smith said under his breath, “At this point, all of our data is tainted… all of it. We need to shut it down, and we need to kill-”

&#x200B;

*“We’re not killing him!”* Dr. Thompson snapped, “In case you’re forgetting, Henry, that’s my son!”

“No, he isn’t!”  Smith replied coldly, “He isn’t even a goddamn human being! We need to put that fucking pupa in an incinerator because none of us here have asked the most important question yet! What is coming out of that pupa? Because I’m pretty sure it’s not Tom Hanks!”

&#x200B;

There was a silence among us.“Jacobi.” I said, “We need to speak with Dr. Jacobi. Once he’s finished his ultrasound. He’ll tell us what’s going on.”“Finally!” Dr. Thompson sighed, “Someone who doesn’t have their head up their ass!”

&#x200B;

Dr. Zhao stared at me for a moment before standing up.“Well he’s had ample time. Let’s get him now.”

&#x200B;

Our footsteps echoes through the halls as we returned to the medical lab. Dr. Thompson was ahead of all of us with Dr. Smith at her heels. All of us were eager to find some decisive answer as to whether or not whatever was inside was still human enough to save. My thoughts leaned towards a morbid curiosity. I didn’t know what to expect out of our collective son. But I was afraid to see what awaited us.

&#x200B;

Dr. Thompson stopped the second the medical lab came into view. Her eyes widened and she took a step back in shock. Dr. Smith stopped beside her, before immediately rushing to open the door and run inside. The rest of us followed, unsure what we were about to see. We didn’t need to wait long.

&#x200B;

The pupa was open and the inside of the lab was covered in blood spatter. I heard Dr. Dean retch beside me as he looked away. I could only stand in terrified horror. Dr. Smith ran to the bloodied lab coat of Dr. Jacobi and stopped. Standing over him and looking down with an expression of horror on his face.

&#x200B;

I wasn’t afforded a proper look at Ian Jacobi’s body, but I didn’t need one. The blood on the floor and the walls said it all.

&#x200B;

His death had been violent.

*Something had torn him to pieces.*

&#x200B;

Dr. Smith recoiled, stepping out of the room silently. His footsteps tracked blood into the hall. None of us could speak. Not until Dr. Zhao broke the silence.

“What have we done…”
