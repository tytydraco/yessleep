Left stranded in the middle of nowhere, Brad and I have no choice but to follow along the dirt road in the hopes of reaching any kind of human civilisation. Although we are both terrified beyond belief, I try my best to stay calm and not lose my head - but Brad’s way of dealing with his terror is to both complain and blame me for the situation we’re in. 

‘I told you coming here was a bad idea – and now look where we are! I don’t even bloody know where we are!’ 

‘Well, how the hell did I know this would happen?!’ I say defensively. 

‘Really? And you’re the one who's always calling me an idiot?’ 

Leading the way with Brad’s phone flashlight, we continue along the winding path of the dirt road which cuts through the plains and brush. Whenever me and Brad aren’t arguing with each other to hide our fear, we’re accompanied only by the silent night air and chirping of nocturnal insects. 

Minutes later into our trailing of the road, Brad then breaks the tense silence between us to ask me, ‘Why the hell did it mean so much for you to come here? Just because your great, great something grandad died here? How was that a risk worth taking?’ 

Too tired, and most of all, too afraid to argue with Brad any longer, I simply tell him the truth as to why coming here was so important to me. 

‘Brad? What do you see when you look at me?’ I ask him, shining the phone flashlight towards my body. 

Brad takes a good look at me, before he then says in typical Brad fashion, ‘I see an angry black man in a red Welsh rugby shirt.’ 

‘Exactly!’ I say, ‘That’s all anyone sees! Growing up in Wales, all I ever heard was, “You’re not a proper Welshman cause your mum’s a Nigerian.” It didn’t even matter how good of a rugby player I was...’ As I continue on with my tangent, I notice Brad’s angry, fearful face turns to what I can only describe as guilt, as though the many racist jokes he’s said over the years has finally stopped being funny. ‘But when I learned my great, great – great grandad died here fighting for the British Empire... Oh, I don’t know!... It made me finally feel proud or something...’ 

Once I finish blindsiding Brad with my motives for coming here, we both remain in silence as we continue to follow the dirt road. Although Brad has never been the sympathetic type, I knew his silence was his way of showing it – before he finally responds, ‘...Yeah... I kind of get that. I mean-’ 

‘-Brad, hold on a minute!’ I interrupt, before he can finish. Although the quiet night had accompanied us for the last half-hour, I suddenly hear a brief but audible rustling far out into the brush. ‘Do you hear that?’ I ask. Staying quiet for several seconds, we both try and listen out for an accompanying sound. 

‘Yeah, I can hear it’ Brad whispers, ‘What is that?’  

‘I don’t know. Whatever it is, it’s sounds close by.’ 

We again hear the sound of rustling coming from beyond the brush – but now, the sound appears to be moving, almost like it’s flanking us. 

‘Reece, it’s moving.’ 

‘I know, Brad.’ 

‘What if it’s a predator?’ 

‘There aren't any predators here. It’s probably just a gazelle or something.’ 

Continuing to follow the rustling with our ears, I realize whatever is making it, has more or less lost interest in us. 

‘Alright, I think it’s gone now. Come on, we better get moving.’ 

We return to following the road, not wanting to waist any more time with unknown sounds. But only five or so minutes later, feeling like we are the only animals in a savannah of darkness, the rustling sound we left behind returns. 

‘That bloody sound’s back’ Brad says, wearisome, ‘Are you sure it’s not following us?’ 

‘It’s probably just a curious animal, Brad.’ 

‘Yeah, that’s what concerns me.’ 

Again, we listen out for the sound, and like before, the rustling appears to be moving around us. But the longer we listen, out of some fearful, primal instinct, the sooner do we realize the sound following us through the brush... is no longer alone. 

‘Reece, I think there’s more than one of them!’ 

‘Just keep moving, Brad. They’ll lose interest eventually.’ 

‘God, where’s Mufasa when you need him?!’ 

We now make our way down the dirt road at a faster pace, hoping to soon be far away from whatever is following us. But just as we think we’ve left the sounds behind, do they once again return – but this time, in more plentiful numbers. 

‘Bloody hell, there’s more of them!’ 

Not only are there more of them, but the sounds of rustling are now heard from both sides of the dirt road. 

‘Brad! Keep moving!’ 

The sounds are indeed now following us – and while they follow, we begin to hear even more sounds – different sounds. The sounds of whining, whimpering, chirping and even cackling. 

‘For God’s sake, Reece! What are they?!’ 

‘Just keep moving! They’re probably more afraid of us!’ 

‘Yeah, I doubt that!’ 

The sounds continue to follow and even flank ahead of us - all the while growing ever louder. The sounds of whining, whimpering, chirping and cackling becoming still louder and audibly more excited. It is now clear these animals are predatory, and regardless of whatever they want from us, Brad and I know we can’t stay to find out. 

‘Screw this! Brad, run! Just leg it!’ 

Grabbing a handful of Brad’s shirt, we hurl ourselves forward as fast as we can down the road, all while the whines, chirps and cackles follow on our tails. I’m so tired and thirsty that my legs have to carry me on pure adrenaline! Although Brad now has the phone flashlight, I’m the one running ahead of him, hoping the dirt road is still beneath my feet. 

‘Reece! Wait!’ 

I hear Brad shouting a good few metres behind me, and I slow down ever so slightly to give him the chance to catch up. 

‘Reece! Stop!’ 

Even with Brad now gaining up with me, he continues to yell from behind - but not because he wants me to wait for him, but because, for some reason, he wants me to stop. 

‘Stop! Reece!’ 

Finally feeling my lungs give out, I pull the breaks on my legs, frightened into a mind of their own. The faint glow of Brad’s flashlight slowly gains up with me, and while I try desperately to get my dry breath back, Brad shines the flashlight on the ground before me. 

‘Wha... What, Brad?...’ 

Waiting breathless for Brad’s response, he continues to swing the light around the dirt beneath our feet. 

‘The road! Where’s the road!’ 

‘Wha...?’ I cough up. Following the moving flashlight, I soon realize what the light reveals isn’t the familiar dirt of tyres tracks, but twigs, branches and brush. ‘Where’s the road, Brad?!’ 

‘Why are you asking me?!’ 

Taking the phone from Brad’s hand, I search desperately for our only route back to civilisation, only to see we’re surrounded on all sides by nothing but untamed shrubbery.  

‘We need to head back the way we came!’ 

‘Are you mad?!’ Brad yells, ‘Those things are back there!’ 

‘We don’t have a choice, Brad!’   

Ready to drag Brad away with me to find the dirt road, the silence around us slowly fades away, as the sound of rustling, whining, whimpering, chirping and cackling returns to our ears.  

‘Oh, shit...’ 

The variation of sounds only grows louder, and although distant only moments ago, they are now coming from all around us. 

‘Reece, what do we do?’ 

I don’t know what to do. The animal sounds are too loud and ecstatic that I can’t keep my train of thought – and while Brad and I move closer to one another, the sounds continue to circle around us... Until, lighting the barren wilderness around, the sounds are now accompanied by what must be dozens of small bright lights. Matched into pairs, the lights flicker and move closer, making us understand they are in fact dozens of blinking eyes... Eyes belonging to a large pack of predatory animals. 

‘Reece! What do we do?!’ Brad asks me again. 

‘Just stand your ground’ I say, having no idea what to do in this situation, ‘If we run, they’ll just chase after us.’ 

‘...Ok!... Ok!...’ I could feel Brad’s body trembling next to me. 

Still surrounded by the blinking lights, the eyes growing in size only tell us they are moving closer, and although the continued whines, chirps and cackles have now died down... they only give way to deep, gurgling growls and snarls – as though these creatures have suddenly turned into something else. 

Feeling as though they’re going to charge at any moment, I scan around at the blinking, snarling lights, when suddenly... I see an opening. Although the chances of survival are minimal, I know when they finally go in for the kill, I have to run as fast as I can through that opening, no matter what will come after. 

As the eyes continue to stalk ever closer, I now feel Brad grabbing onto me for the sheer life of him. Needing a clear and steady run through whatever remains of the gap, I pull and shove Brad until I was free of him – and then the snarls grew even more aggressive, almost now a roar, as the eyes finally charge full throttle at us! 

‘RUN!’ I scream, either to Brad or just myself! 

Before the eyes and whatever else can reach us, I drop the flashlight and race through the closing gap! I can just hear Brad yelling my name amongst the snarls – and while I race forward, the many eyes only move away... in the direction of Brad behind me. 

‘REECE!’ I hear Brad continuously scream, until his screams of my name turn to screams of terror and anguish. ‘REECE! REECE!’  

Although the eyes of the creatures continue to race past me, leaving me be as I make my escape through the dark wilderness, I can still hear the snarls – the cackling and whining, before the sound of Brad’s screams echoe through the plains as they tear him apart! 

I know I am leaving my best friend to die – to be ripped apart and devoured... But if I don’t continue running for my life, I know I’m going to soon join him. I keep running through the darkness for as long and far as my body can take me, endlessly tripping over shrubbery only to raise myself up and continue the escape – until I’m far enough that the snarls and screams of my best friend can no longer be heard. 

I don’t know if the predators will come for me next. Whether they will pick up and follow my scent or if Brad’s body is enough to satisfy them. If the predators don’t kill me... in this dry, scorching wilderness, I am sure the dehydration will. I keep on running through the earliest hours of the next morning, and when I finally collapse from exhaustion, I find myself lying helpless on the side of some hill. If this is how I die... being burnt alive by the scorching sun... I am going to die a merciful death... Considering how I left my best friend to be eaten alive... It’s a better death than I deserve... 

Feeling the skin of my own face, arms and legs burn and crackle... I feel surprisingly cold... and before the darkness has once again formed around me, the last thing I see is the swollen ball of fire in the middle of a cloudless, breezeless sky... accompanied only by the sound of a faint, distant hum... 

When I wake from the darkness, I’m surprised to find myself laying in a hospital bed. Blinking my blurry eyes through the bright room, I see a doctor and policeman standing over me. After asking how I’m feeling, the policeman, hard to understand due to my condition and his strong Afrikaans accent, tells me I am very lucky to still be alive. Apparently, a passing plane had spotted my bright red rugby shirt upon the hill and that’s how I was rescued.
