A lot of people say that something is "like Hell," but they don't really know just how awful it is. It will make you question everything, wish for a second chance, and do anything to get out of it. You have hope to start with. You pray, thinking that it matters once you're down there, but eventually, all that gets burned away.

The only thing left of you then is the darkness that put you there. Over time, you begin to lose memories. You forget who you were, and you lose your humanity. It's ripped away slowly, so you can feel it peeling off your soul, what's left of it anyway.

The burning is intense. Indescribable. The best way it can be described is like a dry heat, like when you eat something spicy, but it makes you cough and burns your throat, mouth and nose, except you feel it all over, from the inside out. Everything burns away, and then slowly regenerates, so it can be burned again.

See, what they don't tell you is that your soul has layers. Once one is peeled away by the blaze, another goes, until all that's left is a tiny speck of what it used to be. Then it all comes back at once, and the slow burn starts over. There is no pain on Earth to describe it.

It's a dark place, full of evil and despair. The flames don't make any light, so you can't really see much. It's not that simple, though. You'd think the burning would be the worst part, but the most horrible thing isn't what happens to you - it's what you become willing to do to others, to save yourself. Then it's an all different kind of Hell, where you wrestle with what it means to choose: between allowing yourself to burn, or being willing to cause more suffering to escape it.

Everyone there is evil, in some form or another. They all ended up there for a reason, after all. Pedophiles, rapists, murderers, the worst of the worst of the worst. People who were truly awful when they were on Earth shouldn't deserve any mercy, at least that's what you think when you're on this side of the dirt. The things you become willing to do, though, even to them - it will make you have empathy for even them.

See, I've been there. I barely even remember what happened to me before I was there. All I remember is it was some sort of wreck. One that I did not survive, at least not at first. You hear stories of near-death experiences (NDEs) all the time, and they usually sound so fleeting. Any time spent elsewhere, though, does not follow our rules of time. You can be there for the equivalent of centuries, and all that passes here is a quick moment.

The burning is awful, and I don't know how long I was there. It could have been minutes, or it could have been several hundred years. What I remember is a group of people offering to get me out of it, and that Hell had more to it, that there was worse than the burning. They pulled me out of the fire, and offered me a choice: either stay in the pit and burn forever, or join them on their mission.

When you're made that kind of offer, you'd do anything to get out of the pit, no matter what it means, for you or anyone else. As soon as I was out of the fire, the relief was instant. I felt my soul begin to reform, and not burn away this time. I was immensely grateful, and willing to do anything if it meant that I got to stay whole. Of course, it's easy to think that at first, but there was a catch. They explained to me that to stay out of the fire, we would have to catch those who somehow escaped it on their own, and punish them before sending them back. Otherwise, there was the risk that they could make it to Earth, and cause untold suffering on a level that we just can't comprehend.

They summoned these motorcycles that were somehow alive, pulsating with bones, melted flesh and rotten crystals that smelled like smoke and sulphur. They were dressed like a biker gang; it was like they weren't even trying to avoid the stereotype. They had apparently been there for thousands of our years, which down there, meant the equivalent to several hundred millenia.

I explained that I felt too weak to do anything, even to stand, and that I needed to just rest. But they told me there is no rest in Hell. Either you do the work, or you burn. There were four of them in total: 3 men and 1 woman, at least that's how I perceived them; but I believed them to actually be something far more sinister. One of them produced a small pill and instructed me to take it, that it would make me strong and give me the power I needed to do what had to be done, so I took it.

I didn't bother asking them why they saved me, why I was picked, or what it all meant. I didn't care. Not yet. I rode on the back of one of the motorcycles with one of them, and we drove around what I can only describe as an empty, destroyed town, one that looked like it had been ravaged by war, flame and destruction. The sky was a hopeless white, and everything else was black and gray. The buildings were smoking and the roads were dilapidated. Plus, not to add to the stereotype again, but there were plenty of crossroads, each of which was guarded by a vile demon. If you stopped at one, they would catch you and throw you back in the pit, so it was crucial to keep moving.

We eventually came upon our first... target. He was a murderer, someone who killed children when he was alive, because he thought it was "fun." Obviously, an evil man who deserved to be down there, to suffer for all eternity. One of the men showed me what they do: torture. He ripped him up from the ground where he was hiding, and did... awful things to him. Think of the worst thing you can imagine being done to someone, just the very worst thing. This was a thousand times as bad. There's nothing in our world that can describe the torture being done. The tools they used, the methods, there are no words to describe it. People say that to make a point, but I mean there are literally no words to describe it because there is no Earthly equivalent. Sure, there were some things we'd recognize, like carving him up while he was conscious, peeling away the layers of his soul until all that was left was that speck, and then destroying the speck, but after that... well, it's hard to describe. The speck would come back for a moment, and they'd capture it, putting it into a small pouch, which apparently contained its own pocket of Hell, one that was much deeper than the one we were in, and much worse. This other place wasn't just burning, but a whole new level of terror. Demons would ravage the innards of those who were doomed to be there, eating them, and inside of those demons were further Hells, where each version got a little worse, so even if they climbed out again, they'd only be moving up to another Hell, too weak to try anything else. Then they'd get shoved down again even deeper than they were before.

These people seemed to enjoy what they did, laughing about it, hooting and hollering, cheering and feeling genuinely ecstatic about what they were doing. It unnerved me, because then, how were we any better? But I did not dare say this. I was too afraid, because I didn't want to go back into the pit, or worse, go even further down. So, we just rode around, looking for more terrible souls who committed unspeakable acts of evil during their time.

When we came upon the next one, it was my turn to practice what I had learned and observed. I don't even remember what I did, and I don't want to. The next thing I remember is shivering, shaking scared, being shocked at what I was capable of doing. The only other thing I remember before coming to was the begging and the pleading that this woman did, asking for forgiveness, truly repenting for what she had done, calling for God to help her, for me to save her or take her with us, anything to escape what was happening. But it's like I couldn't control myself. I continued, despite how I felt. When I was "myself" again, I felt a slew of guilt and regret that, again, has no comparison in our world. That in itself is its own kind of Hell.

We must have kept this up for decades there, until I finally couldn't handle it anymore, and I wanted to stop. Once you've been out of the pit for a while, some semblance of your humanity begins to restore. I don't know why it didn't seem to for them, which is why I don't think they were fully human, or human at all. I vocalized how I was feeling, and they became a whole new kind of angry. They seemed to feel betrayed and viscerally offended that I felt awful for what we were doing. Did those awful people deserve to suffer? Yes, of course, but I still felt awful. I still had a conscience somehow, like my humanity wasn't fully gone. I was clinging to my old life somehow, memories beginning to return. The feelings of, "what have I done?" were overwhelming.

Seeing this, they began to drag me back to the pit, tying me to the back of one of the motorcycles and driving off. That pain was almost as bad as the burning. Once we were back at the pit, I was terrified at first, but you'd be surprised at what you can get used to when you've experienced something far worse. I don't think there's a more fitting occasion than to say that sometimes, it's better to stick with the devil you know, than to become one yourself.

So, I told them to go ahead. The things we were doing were so awful that I actually preferred to burn myself, than to cause suffering for others. I felt like I deserved it. It would be awful, and it would never, ever stop, but at least I wouldn't be hurting anyone. I just wasn't built for it. They picked me up, ready to throw me back in, but something happened.

There was a bright, white light, and the grace and peace I felt were... well, again, there's nothing in our world to describe it. See, the thing is, if something that evil can exist, then the opposite must be true too. I felt so much love and forgiveness, and suddenly, I was awake in a hospital bed in the ICU. It wasn't a great feeling, but by comparison to where I had just been, it felt downright heavenly.

I prayed ceaselessly, asked for a Bible and began to read and study. I began to turn to God, not out of fear, but out of repentance. I like to think that the choice I made down there is what gave me another chance, and I don't intend to waste it. So, heed my warning, while you still can: Hell is real, and it is so much worse than we think it is. What I saw was just a very small part of it, and more horrid things lurk down there that I didn't get to witness. I hope I never have to again.

The thing that gets me through all the pain, suffering and aching of this life is the knowledge that if hate that strong can exist, then love of that strength can too, and that faith is the vehicle for love that will save us all.
