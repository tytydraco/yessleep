I haven't spoken about these events to anyone since they've happened to me over a decade ago, honestly, closer to fifteen years. I am now a 30 year old man and what I experienced in Red Ash, Caryville Tennessee  happened to me when I was about 15 or 16 years old.

Red Ash is a small area off interstate 75 running through Campbell County Tennessee, the county where I was born and raised and still reside in now. Red Ash was established over a hundred years ago as a little mining province, but is now defined as the land between Red Ash Cemetery and Red Ash Baptist Church off of old Tennessee Highway 63 and if you go googling it you'll see that it has a reputation of arguably being one of the most haunted places in Tennessee. 

From ghosts of miners, goatmen, and even murdered witches; if you read long and deep enough, you'll see there's lots of strange happenings around this area. But I am not here to tell you I saw a 7 foot tall man with the head of a goat and hooven feet standing at the base of a train track tussle. But what I saw I still to this day can't explain.

About 15 years ago, a few friends and I, one guy who was a couple years older than myself and two lady friends of ours, were driving around one Saturday night looking to find something to get into in our small, quiet town. So naturally, of course, we came to the conclusion to do what all the teenage kids do that grow up in our county. We decided to go to Red Ash and test some of the legends and boy are their a lot of them.

But those are stories for a different page, this one isn't about urban legends. This is about what I actually saw. 

We went to a set of train tracks that if you park on and turn your vehicle off that, somehow, the car will start to rock and gently roll off the tracks. That didn't work for us.  So we decided to head up the road to the cemetery to tell ghost stories. On the ride to the cemetery, one of the girls with us said her grandpa had told her on one of the unnamed dirt roads in Red Ash is an old, abandoned graveyard where a lady was murdered and buried almost two hundred years ago for supposedly being a witch. 

We thought what the hell and decided to go looking for this graveyard to see if we could find the unmarked grave. We turn down one dirt road barely wife enough for my friends small car and drive down it for a few minutes when all of a sudden we're hit with blue lights behind us. 

And when I say all of a sudden, I mean it. Now, mind you it was around midnight and pretty dark out but we didn't see headlights or anything trailing behind us. Just the burst of blue police lights. My friend pulls off the road as much as possible and the cop pulls behind us and gets out of his cruiser and walks to the door. My friend already has his window down. It's late July and 80 degrees at night with no AC in his car, and he is waiting to be asked for his license and registration. The cop doesn't ask for it though. He walks up and looks through the rolled down window at my friend and says, "You guys shouldn't be here, it's dangerous and a bad place. Please leave."

Now I'm not sure about you guys, but hearing a guy say shouldn't and please isn't normal. Usually we here can't and now. But that's what he said and it through my friend off and he kind of stammered for words before the cop repeated himself, "Please tell me you'll turn around, you shouldn't be here. It's dangerous." This time though my friend said yes sir and the cop just turned around and walked back to his car, turned off his lights and drove around us, continuing on thr road. That's when I noticed he wasn't driving one of the Tahoes or Chargers they typically drove, but a crown vic and an OLD crown vic. An early 80s square body Crown Victoria car. It was so bizarre. 

But we didn't think much of it then, we just decided to head straight and follow him and turn around when he did. We followed him for a few seconds, up until he went up the hill on the dirt road and went around a curve, once we got up there passed the curve we noticed he was gone. Couldn't see any signs of his vehicle or anything. He wasn't pulled over off the road so we thought he might have been more familiar with the road and must have sped up to get to the end of it. So we followed the road for a couple more miles, no sign of the cop anywhere... until we got to the end of the road and it ended in a dead end. The cop was still no where. No signs of him passing us, pulling off the road (which was barely wide enough for him to pass us while we were pulled off it earlier) and there were no roads connecting to this old dirt road. 

So many little weird things happened, and honestly, I still don't know what I saw or how to explain it. All I can say is that things are weird up there around Red Ash, and even now, I still listen to that cop... it's dangerous up there, and I stay away from it.
