[\[Part 19\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1ay8q4s/the_children_of_the_oak_walker_part_19/)

Within a few minutes, an archway came into view, lined with another row of green nylon sandbags. Coils of razor wire sat on either side of the old trackway, along with four additional guards with automatic weapons slung on their shoulders. These were more of the same fare at the first gate, but it was what lay beyond them that left me breathless.

The tunnel swelled to a cement-lined cavern roughly forty feet wide, twenty feet high, and almost sixty yards deep. Large metal ventilation shafts hung from dusty supports in the ceiling, and raised platforms lined both sides of the central trackway, with an upper level for each set atop enormous cement pillars. A circular area in the center of the room blazed with light, and it lit up the dozens of booths packed amongst both levels of either platform. Each seemed to be roughly the size of a large tent, perhaps 12-foot square at most, and were constructed of various patterns in plywood, sheet metal, and brick. Doors were just as diverse in their making, either ratty blankets, plank shutters, or real surface-made doors with knobs. Hand-painted wooden signs pointed up and down the concrete staircases of the platform levels, and a single iron catwalk crossed the ceiling from one to another. The air here was warmer, drier, and the sour aromas of the other tunnels were chased away by the heady scent of cooking oil and propane. Like a scene from a third-world country, children played in a flat part of one platform with a soccer ball made of trash, a group of women gossiped in a circle as they scrubbed clothes in large rubber wash tubs, and teams of older men in work boots called to one another over their labor on some kind of storage shed in the far corner of the room. Everything was both dull and alive, cramped and fluid, depressing and intriguing so that I scarcely had time to take it all in.

Awed nonetheless, I let my former dismal thoughts be chased away by the austere beauty of the ramshackle colony, eyes wide as we rolled onward from the second checkpoint.

*It’s like a gypsy camp had a one-night stand with a nuclear bunker.*

“We call this the Castle.” Andrea half-shouted over her shoulder from the passenger seat of the cart. “Way back during the 80’s, the local government tried to build a mini subway system to cut down on traffic and create more jobs. As it was the pet-project of the mayor at the time, he didn’t want to share the glory, so the administration never told anyone either local or higher that they were going to build it.”

Tex had to slow as we drove into the large circular pit at the center of the room, and upon looking down, I realized it was not a pit but a railroad turnstile, like the kind used to flip locomotives around at train yards for a return journey down the same track. Here the residents had erected a vibrant pseudo-market much like our own back in New Wilderness, though their wares were made up of things they’d scrounged from the surface, likely in abandoned houses, and there was little in the way of food for sale. Big metal vats sat over several communal cookstoves run off bulky propane burners, and much of the containers were filled with boiling water, a line of people already waiting with jugs, bottles, and canteens for their share.

“Of course, little Barron County ran out of money before the first turnstile station was even halfway done.” Andrea leaned back in her seat, and some of the tension eased from her shoulders, as if she could finally breathe now that we were deep within the hidden guts of Black Oak. “Being the typical politician, the mayor didn’t want to admit he’d screwed up, and had this part bricked over with crews hired from Florida so the truth couldn’t get out. When asked about the sizable government deficit, the city claimed it had all been renovations to the foundation of the courthouse that had gone over budget.”

Bent forward so I didn’t have to yell over the roar of the station I clung to the back of Andrea’s seat as we bumped over a few sections of corroded track that remained in place. “But surely *someone* would have remembered. I mean, they would have had to dig down, move lots of dirt just to get this place built. How could no one notice?”

“I guess they were better at corruption than accounting, a trait that seems to have been passed down to our current administration.” Andrea’s lips pulled into a thin line, and she scratched at the back of her head. “They buried the story so deep that when I found the old schematics in the courthouse record vault, no one had opened that storage drawer for years. It was right around then that Sheriff Wurnauw figured out that I knew more about the mutants than I should, so I hid down here until I found the empty station. Once things got really bad, we moved everyone else in, salvaged materials from ruined homes and viola, the Castle was born.”

We slowed, and Tex braked the cart to a halt.

I looked up in time to feel a shiver of mysterious wonder run down my spine.

*Okay, that’s just freaking cool.*

Of all the station’s rag-tag architecture, this was the only stand-alone structure in its own right, built onto the back wall furthest from the tunnel entrance. Red bricks engulfed a large swathe of floorspace, and rose all the way to the dingy ceiling, where slanted bits of sheet metal turned any condensation that might have dripped from the concrete overhead. I suspected these had come from the city-made barrier that previously sealed the unfinished station, broken free of their old position and slathered with fresh mortar to be laid into this masterpiece. Real glass windows had been set in place, an optimistic change from the hovel-like shacks at the residential areas, and the entire two-story edifice had a colonial-style mansion appeal to it. A set of black-painted wooden double doors sat in the middle of the first floor, and a balcony had even been added to the second, lining the upper-level windows which glowed with an almost mystical light. In the dim shadows of this last free refuge for modern man, this building glowed like a star, and I felt myself drawn to it with intrinsic desire to see more.

“Figure we can put you up here until we decide on a plan going forward.” Tex cracked his back and turned around to meet my gaze. “Listen, the professor’s a good guy, by far the smartest man I know, but he’s a bit . . . old fashioned. Has a way of talking that sometimes makes other people feel dumb, even though he doesn’t try to. Just don’t take any of it too seriously, okay? He means well.”

I did my best not to frown in dread at that but climbed dutifully from the tiny vehicle to follow them up the brick steps.

Upon drawing nearer to the double doors, I found they weren’t black as I’d originally thought, but dark navy blue, and traced on them in delicate etchings of gold-colored paint lay a magnificent rendition of the sun. Vines had been painted up the sides of the door posts, full of leaves that seemed to stretch for the long ray marks on the main doors, and part of me wanted to reach out and touch them just to be sure they weren’t in fact real. Above it all, strange words were engraved in a type of writing I had never seen before, and yet when I looked at them, my feet froze to the threshold.

Deep inside my skull, the strange calming sensation poured over me; the blood rushed through my veins, synapses popped away in my brain, and my heart beat in a curious flicker. Something moved, broke free, clicked into place like a key that had been out of its socket for far too long, and all at once, I gasped.

*Impossible.*

Both eyes stayed riveted to the carved letters, and I fought unexplainable tears as the words came to me in an avalanche so profound, that I couldn’t help but breathe them out. “Those who reach for the light of truth have no need to fear the darkest of lies.”

Tex and Andrea whirled to stare at me, and at once the sensation ended, my embarrassment returning in full force.

“You can read Latin?” Andrea’s brownish-red eyebrow arched on her porcelain skin.

*Can I? Since when? Why on earth am I borderline crying right now?*

Blinking at the bizarre wellspring of emotion, I shrugged, and sucked in a fresh gulp of air. “No. I-I don’t know. Maybe?”

Pushing the right-side door open for me, Tex glanced around for prying eyes. “Come on. Don’t want to draw a crowd.”

Inside, the first floor of the building contained several tables, chairs, and a homemade hand-washing station with a suspended water tank over the spigot. Glass laboratory equipment stood along the countertops in places, and rows of metal filing cabinets in the far side of the room stood like sentries in a kind of forbidden tomb. Steel I-beams along the wall had been bolted together to support the upper floor, welded in places for added strength. I tasted sulfur and chlorine on the air, along with old paper, and somewhere in the background, a clock ticked on in its mechanical slumber. Few lights were lit here; in fact, much of the warm yellow rays flooded down from a wrought iron staircase on my right, which looked as though it had been stolen from someone’s garden veranda due to a few dried leaves stuck to its handrail.

Unabashed by the shadowy interior, Tex led me up the circular flight of metal steps, each creaking like an old steam ship at our weight, but holding all the same. At the top, I climbed into the bank of brilliant golden light, and swayed in surprise.

*Oh Chris, I wish you could see this.*

Lined along the walls, stacked on tables, and piled in corners were mountains of books. They shone in the light of dozens of candles, old tomes and newer releases, fiction and fact all mixed in together on the dozens of improvised wooden shelves. Everything from the rafters, shelves, and windowsills had been painted in the sweeping colors of a garden of sunlight. Golden trees, shining grass, gilded vines and detailed flowers beyond count reached ever skyward. Stars crossed the ceiling above me, the sun looking down in Renaissance level extravagance, and there was even a suit of armor in the corner, propped upright on its stand with a few more books tucked in between the metal feet. A desk sat close to us, awash in papers, books, and a china tea set with the kettle steaming in its plate.

In the midst of it all, with his back to us, stood a man.

He was tall, thin, and had well-combed silver hair with flecks of its old brown still evident in places. The man wore tweed slacks, a long-sleeved white shirt with the cuffs half rolled up, and a reddish-brown waistcoat in the style of a century preceding the one I’d been born into. I judged him to be in his mid-fifties, perhaps early sixties, though I couldn’t be certain for the ramrod-straight way he held himself, almost aristocratic in stance. He held a book in his spidery hands, and a paint-smeared apron lay over an easel nearby, a suit coat to match his tweed pants astride a faded high-backed armchair. I’d never run in to someone so well dressed in the entire time I’d been in Baron County, and even his brown oxford shoes had a gleam to them that seemed to defy the grimy darkness of the tunnel outside. Here, in this place, the decay of our world had been halted; here I stood in the presence of something incredible.

“Professor?” Tex cleared his throat, and the former soldier laced both hands behind his back in what had to be an automatic reflex from years gone by in the military. “I wondered if we might have a moment.”

The man turned to reveal a pair of sharp cheekbones, hazel irises like mine used to be, and eyebrows that still held their original tint of motor-oil brown.

“Professor, this is Hannah Brun.” Andrea pointed her elbow my way, both hands hooked into her trouser pockets. “Hannah, meet Dr. Henry J. Carheim.”

“Delighted to meet you, young lady.” He put the book down to circumvent the table and shake my hand with excited vigor, his own palms flecked with dried specks of gold, blue, and other assorted colors. “I hope you’re in good health, especially after being in the hands of the Organs. Please excuse the paint, I was something of an amateur artist before the mercenaries came to town, and I find it helps keep my spirits up.”

*If this is what this guy calls ‘amateur’ then I’d hate to think of what he’d say about my cringy filmmaking skills.*

Cheeks aflame in self-consciousness, I shook my head. “I’m okay. Thanks to you guys, I wasn’t in their custody very long. I love your work though, this place is amazing.”

He sighed, and Professor Carheim swept one arm at his surroundings. “Merely imitations of better worlds imagined by better men. I used to teach history, before such a thing was a crime, but I have always had a soft spot in my heart for the works of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. I’ve been down here since the Organs demanded all faculty at Black Oak University sign a pledge not to teach anything that could ‘undermine the reconstruction efforts’ of the county. I refused of course; unfortunately, most of my colleges did not, and a good many students bent the knee as well.”

“And now they’re part of the Organs.” I shoved my hands into my jeans pockets and remembered how the gray-uniformed guards had torn my room apart with glee.

The man’s shoulders slumped, and Professor Carheim let slide a mournful half smile. “They weren’t evil at the start, you know. Most of them were bright, full of energy, and optimistic about their future. I had such high hopes . . . but power drives men to madness, and those kids swallowed every lie the city government told them in exchange for it. Which brings us to our present conundrum.”

He pulled up a chair for me, and the professor, Andrea, and Tex occupied others in a small circle around his cluttered work desk.

Picking up a small black notebook and a pen, Professor Carheim clicked his pen, and fixed the three of us with an expectant look as though we’d all been called into his office to discuss our grades. “The Organs will be busy looking for Miss Brun here for quite a while, as well as try to cover up their latest failure with a propaganda campaign. In the meantime, I think we should try to exploit this situation in one of two ways; either we strike at their internment camps in the northern district to gain fresh recruits, or we could clear out more mutants in the abandoned parts of the city to gain operational space. Your thoughts?”

“ELSAR won’t be able to cover up their HQ getting blasted.” Tex picked a fragment of asphalt from his uniform sleeve and rubbed at his dirty face with one hand. “Which means they’re going to be looking for a way to engage us decisively. We should play to our strengths and lay low for a few days or more, until the heat’s off.”

“We still have that hive to worry about.” Andrea crossed her arms, lips pursed in thought. “The feed mill is less than a mile from one of our major supply routes in the sewers. If we don’t burn them out now, the freaks will be picking off my Smugglers in a matter of days.”

Tex tossed the shrapnel fragment in his hand away, and threw her a tired glance. “We would have to run probing attacks on the surface to draw attention away from the north. If the drones catch the heat from our flamethrowers on their thermals, we’re screwed. I’m all for pushing while we have some momentum, but my Fighters need a rest, and some have been going non-stop for the past 48 hours.”

“I could have some of my Librarians lend a hand in scrambling the drone flight patterns.” Professor Carheim tapped his pen on his chin. “But it would take time away from our weapons development initiative. We’ll need that Greek fire to burn the hives out, especially with the dampness in the tunnels.”

From where I sat, I couldn’t help but smile to myself in a homesick wistfulness. Despite our differences in numbers and terrain, it seemed the resistance of Black Oak and the citizens of New Wilderness weren’t that far apart in terms of our survival mechanisms.

*Fighters, smugglers, and librarians. Not too far off from rangers, workers, and researchers. Great minds think alike . . . that, or we’re all grasping at the same doomed straws.*

Andrea rested both hands on her knee, legs crossed in a patient, if exhausted stance. “I guess one day can’t hurt, but honestly it wouldn’t surprise me if those things are stalking our outer checkpoint right now. Besides, if we can clear more space, we can move more refugees underground, and we’re going to have to anyway with the winter coming on. Once the snows come, you can bet the Organs will use the gas ration to smoke out any non-conformers left up there.”

“All the more reason to rest, rearm, and hit them while they’re on the backfoot.” Shucking his uniform jacket, Tex untucked the light gray T-shirt underneath and fished a well-wrinkled pack of nicotine gum from his pants pockets. “If we could free some of their political prisoners from the work camp at the construction site, we’d have at least 1,000 able-bodied people ready to fight. We could push ELSAR out of the northern district and cut them off from the airport. Without their air support, we would almost be on even terms.”

“Almost.” Professor Carheim scratched notes into his paper with swift, practiced ease. “The Chechens in Grozny were almost on equal terms with the Russians, and they still lost. But I have to agree that at least one day to recuperate wouldn’t hurt. Besides, it would give us time to evaluate Miss Brun, as her condition is perhaps the most important research we might conduct.”

At that, they all turned to me, as if expecting a deep, insightful addition to their plight.

*I really hate being put on the spot.*

Knowing that I had to stick to my primary mission if I wanted to save anyone in Barron County, I swallowed a nervous lump in my throat. “I, um . . . I can’t stay.”

Tex opened his mouth to speak, likely in protest, but Professor Carheim held up a hand to cut him off. “I’m sure she has her reasons. She isn’t our trophy, after all. Let the girl talk.”

“I have to go back to New Wilderness.” I focused on Tex the most, as I could see the disappointment in his eyes, something that bothered me after all he’d done in my defense today. “Our leader is planning an offensive to drive ELSAR out of the city, but he has no idea you guys are holding out in here. If I could get back, I could warn Sean that there are friendly units inside the wall, and maybe together we could—”

“Sean?” Andrea’s eyes lit up, a slight glow coming to her cheeks. “As in Sean Hammond?”

*She almost jumped out of her chair.*

Taken aback by her sudden recognition, I nodded. “He’s our commander. There’s close to 500 of us living in a fort we built in the old wildlife reserve. Further south is Ark River, another colony near Maple Lake.”

Her pink lips flashed with happiness, before Andrea seemed to realize the two men were watching her, and she smothered it with a fake cough of embarrassment. “That’s, uh, that’s good. For you, I mean. Continue.”

Looking down at my hands for a moment, I stared at the beginnings of the silvery tattoos on my right wrist and tried to condense my swirling thoughts. “The thing is, New Wilderness might be in trouble. There’s a force of bandits from the south that could already be attacking it, and besides them . . . there’s Vecitorak.”

Just saying his name made my stomach curdle, and my ears hissed with an angry static. I could feel the wooden knife in my skin again, smelled his rotted swamp-water breath, and heard his mocking laugh. It was all I could do not to shudder on the spot in dread.

“Here.”

I flicked my eyes upward to see Professor Carheim slide a teacup my way, his mouth pulled into a sympathetic grimace.

“For the nerves.”

Grateful for something to put over my face, I scooped the warm ceramic up and drained it all, the brown contents tasting of lemon and honey. “Thanks. Anyway . . . the point is, there’s something else out there in the wild between your city and our fort, something worse than bullets and claws. Have you ever heard of or seen a Type 7 mutant?”

Tex’s rugged countenance grew dark with foreboding, and he nodded. “Our old squad called them Skinnies. Nasty little freaks. Cleaned a lot of them out from under beds in the outskirts when things first went bad. They liked to crawl under there and wait for people to come home to ambush them.”

“We call them Puppets.” I turned the empty teacup over in my hands and avoided their concerned gazes. “They’re a lot like humans, but incomplete in terms of brain power, and they walk on all fours like an ape. Somehow this hooded person, Vecitorak, found a way to control them, and he’s got a small army on his side.”

“So, an army of monkey people?” Andrea raised one rusty-red eyebrow, and I figured she hadn’t seen many of them, or she wouldn’t have dismissed them so lightly.

I shifted on my chair to try and find a comfortable position. “Thanks to Vecitorak, they’re more than that. I’ve seen them walk upright, use weapons, ride other mutants like we do with horses. He’s not exactly human himself, half rotted, half normal and . . .  and he has a dagger that he can use to change people into them.”

Tex drummed his fingers on the square belt buckle of his uniform with a skeptical frown. “And you know this how?”

*I already own you.*

Shame burned on my face as Vecitorak’s words resurfaced in distant memory, but I rolled my right sleeve up so the light would catch the vines inked there. “He showed it to me.”

All three went rigid in astonished silence, and I took the opportunity to carry on with my own proposal.

“Look, I know it sounds insane, but there’s some kind of object out there, something one of our group knew about before he died, and gave the secret of its whereabouts to me. I don’t know exactly what it is, but I think it could end this war. I have to get to it before ELSAR does, and thanks to one of their spies, they already know it exists. That means I might not have a week or two to wait, and I can’t get past the perimeter wall without your help. I can’t stay, because if I do, it’ll be worse for everyone.”

At the end of my desperate pitch, I cast an imploring glance to each of them, heart pounding. Everything was on the line now, and if they refused, locked me up or threw me out, I was done for. Even if they ignored my request, it could spell the end of New Wilderness. Once again, I needed them to help me; but I didn’t know what I could offer in return.

Professor Carheim set aside his pen and eyed the other two, then me. “What about a compromise? If you help us with one of our goals, we’ll see what we can do about getting you across. One mission for every attempt made. That sound fair?”

It hadn’t been exactly what I’d hoped for, but at this rate, I wouldn’t get a better deal. If ELSAR was hunting me through the city, then I had to get out as soon as possible. If I could get back, corner Jamie, and get her to cough up the key, then perhaps we could end this war before things got any worse.

*Assuming she hasn’t handed it over to ELSAR already.*

“I’ll do it.” I stuck my chin out in a stubborn attempt to seem unafraid. “Name the mission, and I’ll help in whatever way I can.”

Andrea shrugged with both hands spread wide. “In that case, I could take her to the feed mill with my group. Whether or not we burn them out, we could use another scouting run on the hive. We could plant some explosives, box them in, just to keep the freaks from spreading.”

“True.” Tex scratched at his chin. “Good intel would be nice when we finally get around to killing them all.”

“Then it’s decided.” Professor Carheim slapped a triumphant palm on one of his bony knees. “Hannah will go with our reconnaissance teams into the northern tunnels. The other scouts will head for the wall to find an exit point. If all goes well, you’ll be able to leave in three or four days.”

I did my best to smile, though my heart skipped a terrified beat. All it would take was one wrong step, one lucky bullet, one sneaky mutant and even the best laid plans would fail. My entire life hinged on this arrangement, and more importantly, it all balanced on a single word.

If.
