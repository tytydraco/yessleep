Hey, everyone. First of all, I want to thank all of you who took the time to read and respond to my last post. Your insights have been invaluable, and I really appreciate your support.


In the comments, someone mentioned that there's no such thing as "Forgetting drugs" that help with pain. And now, after the way Cassandra reacted, I'm starting to think they might be right. Maybe Cassandra was doing something to Alex, but I don't know.


But here's the thing: even though I'm starting to believe that something's not right, I still can't bring myself to just quit and walk away. Even if I put in my two weeks' notice, I'd still have to physically show up to do it. And something about this place, and even Cassandra when she's not on the job, still makes me apprehensive about leaving.


I know some of you are going to say, "Get out of there," and I get it. Trust me, I really do. But it's just not that easy.  Cassandra is actually a really nice girl and has been staying over at my house and cooking a lot. I always feel really tired after she comes over with food she prepared but she's extremely sweet when she's not at the hospital and in "work mode" I guess.



On a different note, I haven't seen Dr. Roberts around lately. I'm assuming he's probably just busy with his responsibilities or something along those lines. I suppose it's not unusual for the head of a hospital to have a lot on their plate. But I'm trying not to read too much into it.




Cassandra and I have been getting along well outside of her work hours, and that's been a bit of a relief. It's easy to forget about the unsettling aspects of the hospital when I'm with her. We've been on more dates, and things seem to be progressing positively between us.



There's somethingâ€¦amazing about her I can't quite place. She's got amazing long hair she keeps in a bun when she's working, her eyes are this beautiful shade of amber and you almost get lost looking at them. Her smile, it's like a burst of sunshine, and it's hard not to feel a warmth in her presence. And her laugh, it's infectious, enough to make anyone forget their worries for a minute.



But it's more than just her looks. It's the way she carries herself, the way she listens when I talk about my concerns and experiences. I always open up to her whenever I eat with her. I don't know, it just feels natural in a way. Like it's what I should be doing with someone like her.



Sorry, I got sidetracked for a minute there.



Anyway, I'm gonna head out. Cassandra is taking me to this fancy restaurant later tonight and I don't want to mess anything up.



I'll let you all know if anything changes or she starts acting crazy besides that one time a few weeks or months ago. I can't really remember haha.
