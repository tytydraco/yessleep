Every once in a while, I like to turn back the pages of my time. Throughout my life, I’ve carried and written in my personal journal, chronicling nearly every single day since I started high school until today

Being able to see how your thoughts used to compose themselves is a wonderful and nostalgic feeling. Sometimes cringy but, it’s almost like I get to have a conversation with my younger self

In my late 20s now, and I still re-read these specific parts ritualistically. Sometimes I wish I could forget but, I know I can never. Posting what is basically my diary for all to see might be a mistake but, I need to immortalize this, and maybe someone out there can learn something. The first chapter I want to share starts on May 19th, 2013. This one’s for you Tommy

Dry leaves crunched under our timid but swift footsteps as we wrestled with low-hanging branches and bushes that would occasionally try to gouge out my eyeballs. The dim glow of the young moon struggled to break through the cloudy night coupled with the thick woods and bushes standing tall over us, avoiding branches was damn near impossible. The destination was turning out to be longer than I was comfortable with, and the sick feeling in my stomach grew with every step

I nudged Irving who was just ahead of me to my right, he turned around pointing his phone light at my chest, I gave him a look of annoyance and shook my head, he received my telepathic message, turned back around, and said

 “Yo Tommy, how much further is this thi-”

“SSSHHH!“

There was a brief pause as Irving gave Tom a done look

“Really? You think anyone’s gonna hear us from way out here?“

“Hey, I got more to lose than you“

Tom spoke with whispered anger, and Irving spoke back out loud, disregarding Tom’s concerns

“You said it wasn’t far“

“Tom: We’ll be there soon, just be patient man, trust me. We gotta be real silent and sneaky or, probably someone’s gonna find and kill us”

He said sarcastically as he crouched down tip-toeing like a bandit. He then accidentally stepped on a dead branch that snapped and cracked loudly

“OOF”

The branch was large enough to take him off balance, he tripped and quickly moved his legs forward to put his weight back in a stable position. We snickered at his clumsiness and he responded with a loud

“SSHH… dang, now my clothes are messed up”

He paused for a moment to dust off all his fancy brand-named clothes, and then our group of 6 returned to our march into who knows where. To a certain extent, I did understand Tom’s anxiety. We all knew how strict Tom’s parents were. Your average, stereotypical nuclear family child. Blond hair, blue eyes. He loved his button-ups

He somehow convinced his parents to let him go to a “sleepover” but, really he was leading his very own group of late-night forest explorers. I don’t know how he chose who to invite on this walk. It seems like it just started with a few close friends who then invited their own separate friends. Bunch of random people I don’t know or care to know

“Could you at least tell us where we’re going?”

Before Tom could answer Irving's question, one of the three girls in the group interrupted with a joke

“He’s probably taking us to the luxury cabin his parents just bought for a billion dollars”

Everyone laughed at Justice’s joke disregarding Tom’s urgency for silence. (I think I overheard Tom say that her name was Justice.) I had been trying to memorize names to not ask for them later. So far I knew only Tom, and Irving from way back but only ever got to know Irving. The first was a little quieter than the rest. I think she’s Hispanic. She has light dark skin and black hair. She spoke next praising Justice a little too hard for her joke

“Hehe, that was funny Justice, you’re so funny”

People will follow you blindly if you seem attractive like somehow that puts you above the rest of us. Popular people don’t even tend to be very interesting. Justice was a tall, very pretty girl, with curly brunette hair. So many guys were after her but she's not my type. Tom interrupted my internal rant with his loud

“SSHH!! …You won’t be laughing when you see what I found.“

Irving then asked Tom in a genuinely worried tone

“Do you even know where you’re going?”

“Uh- of course I do, this direction is… It’s North West”

The girl with the shiny straight light brown hair finally spoke, her voice started strong but, slowly lowered in volume as the other 2 girls stared at her with increasing judgment as she continued speaking

“No, we’ve been heading South West for the past seventeen minutes, and North West for 6 minutes before that… What?”

She stared back at the 2 girls until the quiet one said

“Haha, nerd. Right Justice, Kristene’s a nerd?”

“Totally”

Kristene, Got it

After a few minutes, we reached a circular clearing unburdened by the thick woods blocking out the moonlight. The dreamy blue glow allowed us the view of a small piece of land about the size of one of those little league baseball fields. The land was littered with boulders that varied in size, and a single gigantic tree in the middle. If you squint your eyes, you could almost trick yourself into seeing a pattern, as if the stones had been placed there

“Look, over here!“

We watched Tom break from the treeline where we emerged down to a boulder where the immense tree gripped the earth and rock with powerful roots. The tree seemed to carry countless generations on its bark. Its broad roots sneakily slid into the rock and through years of dedication had pried it open like a walnut. After catching up with Tom, he began speaking without turning his attention from the tree

“The other day, I was walking around here when I heard a loud noise and a crash“

He then acted out what he heard, nearly shooting us with saliva. We all chuckled and the girls said “Eww” in unison laughing at Tom. Irving spoke, trying to contain his laughter.

“Alright, okay man, we get it. Loud noise.“

Tom looked like a child excited to show his parents a drawing he made of them

“Okay but, look. Listen, okay so, I’m pretty sure I heard this boulder fall open! “

He stood there eyes wide with excitement waiting for a reply from us, Justice of course had to make her annoyed comment

“So you brought us out to the school woods in the middle of the night to tell us you heard a rock fall?“

Tom’s excitement immediately drained to disappointment 

“N-no listen-“

Irving wasn’t convinced

“Bullshit, this boulder has just been laying here for a while, you probably just heard something else“

Kristene pointed to the grass

“No, he’s right, look see that? Fresh grass, how could grass grow from under a boulder?“

There was a fresh layer of grass crushed and folded over by the boulder. I was surprised by her observation. Irving stared at the boulder and expressed with a smirk what we were feeling collectively while Justice and the quiet girl groaned in annoyance

“Badass“

Tom spoke lowering his voice halfway through his sentence to sound ominous, he just sounded silly

“But that’s not the point, there’s something else“

He climbed over some roots while giggling to get to the middle of the boulder. I’m pretty sure I caught a glimpse of “Supreme Underwear”. Tom jumped down from the roots in between the halved boulder to a patch of dark dirt where the rock once sat. Irving tried to make his voice sound deeper than it was, pulled up his pants, and said

“Alright guys let’s see what this is”

Irving takes on a slightly different personality when it’s not just him and I, I decided to ignore that. We all then just followed Irving's lead up the roots and watched Tom below. Tom pointed to a round spot darker than the surrounding dirt. He kicked a small stone into the dark spot where it vanished followed by the sound of dirt falling from what turned out to be a hole in the ground. It was so dark that it seemed like it had mass, like if I reached out and pushed on it, it would push back. It wasn’t a big hole, which made it a little more menacing, and was shaped unnaturally perfectly round, like a manhole cover

“So what do you guys think? Pretty cool huh?“

We stared into the pit without uttering a word. I was dreading his next words

“Alright, so who’s going in first?“

“Are you kidding I’m not going in there“

Irving exclaimed as Tom responded with a shit-eating grin

“Now who’s laughing“

“Why don’t you go in there since you’re so brave, a- ..and you found it first“

“I found it, but I haven’t gone inside yet. I wanted to wait for the right moment to go with all of you. Come on Irving, do you want your last year of high school to be the same as every other year, boring, unchanging… or do you want to have the most memorable last year of your life?“

Irving said nothing

“How about you Kiran?“

My heart jumped at the sudden acknowledgment of my existence

“Oh I- I don’t“

“Come on man, show Irving how it's done“

The quiet girl teased Justice

”Come on Justice, you go”

”Haha, no way!”

Justice turned to Kristene

”How about you, Kristene?”

”Yeah Kristene, you go first”

Said the quiet girl. Kristene looked at her friends surprised and hesitant at first, then her face shifted to uncaring and calm, she bounced her eyebrows up and flicked her head to the right and said

”Alright, I’ll go.”

Kristene climbed down without hesitation. Tom stood stunned staring at her, eyebrows raised, head cocked down and forward

”It’s okay if you’re scared Tommy, I’ll show you how it’s done, memorable last year right?”

Tom  finally broke out of his trance, cleared his throat, and responded

”Psshh heh, I’m not... I’m not scared… Um, it's fine. I’ll go first, show you ladies how it's done

Tom rolled up his sleeves and began to climb down carefully, putting two hands at the mouth of the entrance and sliding down. It was like watching someone dip into a pool at night. We heard his voice echo “Woow”

”Well, he didn’t die, come on Kiran”

”Um… yeah just.. Give me a moment here. Actually, could you help me I think I lost my...

I jumped off the roots back to the grass and pretended to search in my backpack for nothing Irving followed

”Your what?”

I watched the rest of the group descend into the hole behind Irving and let out a sigh

”Listen, dude I hate to do this to you, I kinda just wanna go home”

”Kiran! Come on man, don’t be like that”

”I know, it’s just not really I-I don’t know, why couldn’t we just hang at your place like normal?”

”Dude come on, you’re not my only friend, and who knows maybe-”

Irving hesitated before continuing

”You know… I can’t always be there for you, holding your hand. And I don’t mean it like that it's just”

Irving put his hands in front of his chest in a soft karate-looking position, like he was trying to soften the blow of his words. My face felt hot, I was glad the darkness was there to shield the red on my face

”No, I- I get it.”

I just stared at my shoes. We sat there in silence for a few seconds. Finally I sighed before speaking again.

”Alright, let’s go in.”

I caved, and Irving's face lightened the dark around us then he asked, as if to make sure of my decision.

”Yeah?”

”Yeah.”

I helped Irving down and followed behind. Walking into the cave I was surprised at the difference in light. It was dark outside but not here. My eyes took a moment to adjust to my surroundings. This cave was beautiful. The light seemed to emanate from everywhere as if the rocks themselves were glowing. It was baffling not being able to find a source. We all stood speechless, just taking in the odd beauty of the small cave. It was about the size of a small square room, we could just barely stand upright. Ahead of us was a large rectangular opening like a door frame. The ceiling height adjusted to its size.  Whatever the source of light was in here, it didn’t follow very far down this rectangular tunnel.

”Where’s that light coming from?”

Said the quiet girl and Justice responded

”I don’t know, that’s so weird!”

”And why couldn’t we see it from above?”

Irving added to the collection of questions.

”Holy shit guys, this is so much better than I thought it’d be”

Tom pulled out a camera from his backpack and began to film himself.

”What’s up caving nation, look at what we have just found”

Tom began spinning around and jumping, acting like a fool for the camera zooming in and out of his own face, and then everyone else’s. Justice and the quiet girl both posed for the camera while Kristene turned away saying

”Ew! Don’t put me on your camera you creep”

Tom then pointed the camera at us, Irving smiled and wrapped an arm around me holding his thumbs up, I stood there stiffly trying to prevent myself from imploding. Tom spoke

”Alright, guys, I went first into the cave, who’s going through the door?”

Justice responded sounding disturbed

”Ugh, don’t call it a door that’s creepy, you make it sound like someone’s living down here”

”Well, it’s clearly man-made, so… maybe someone is?”

”Shut up don’t say that!”

Said the quiet girl just before Tom yelled

“WOOO”

He zipped by us running down the tunnel, flashlight in hand along with the camera. He ran surprisingly far until we heard shoe scraping on rock followed by a pause then a loud thud and crash. His flashlight spun wildly until it hit the ground and we heard Tom’s painful echo.

”YOOW!!”

We looked at each other surprised and quickly followed down the tunnel. We had to start moving in a line because the tunnel tightened the further we went. At Tom’s crash site we found him on the ground groaning. We were at the  end of the tunnel where it opened up again into another area but we couldn’t see we were back in darkness. Irving flicked his flashlight back on as Tom groaned

”Ahh, Kristene… help me please… it hurts”

Kristene looked around confused but eventually slowly stepped forward towards Tom, she winced and said

”Ah… Oh my Go-”

Tom interrupted her with an admittedly kinda funny-sounding moan

”Oohhh”

He slowly turned to Kristene, his face was scrunched in pain, he brought one hand down to his ankle while the other amazingly still had the camera on us. His foot was completely twisted around, Irving began to freak out there were a lot of “oos” and “aahs” and then Tom did something horrifying, my eyes widened as I watched him grab his foot and wrench it back in place with terrifying ease. Kristene screamed and backed up bumping into me. He screamed out and everyone else did too, even I yelped in shock. Then his scream slowly faded into a breathless laughter. At first, I thought he was going insane from the shock but, then we all collectively rolled our eyes and walked over him. Irving was annoyed

”Really Tom?”

”Come on, that was funny!”

We ignored Tom and continued onward.

We were now deeper into the Earth than before. We began exploring the walls of the new system with our flashlights. This side of the cave seemed naturally formed unlike the room before. This area was large, it was covered in stalagmites and stalactites, It looked just like what I’d see in photos. But the flashlights could only reach the sparkling reflections of moist rock far away

Tom began digging around in his backpack

”Here it is…”

Tom raised a can of spray paint to us.

”You want to vandalize this ancient cave?”

”No, Fabia, It’s not like that, I just want to mark it like… the Apollo mission with the American flag.”

Okay, so her name is Fabia, got it. Irving did a short laugh through his nose and I half rolled my eyes. Tom stood up and began shining his light around

”This spot looks good enough”

He then placed the camera down on a rock and waved everyone over to the rock wall

”Let’s sign our names and take a picture for proof, we’ll be famous.”

We all hesitated at first, then Kristene stepped forward taking one of the spray cans.

”Might as well”

”There are other colors too if you want… Pink.”

Kristene scoffed then continued towards the cave wall. One by one we found a spot to tag. Despite our large group, there were some cans left over. Tom told us not to ask how he got all of those but, he definitely just asked his parents

I decided to go to the left at the end of our group. Kristene, to my right asked

“So what are you going to draw?”

“Um, well our names right..?”

She gave me a long disappointed look before speaking again

“Really? That’s it? You’re so lame.”

I was stunned, I didn’t know what to say. That kinda stung. Then she abruptly burst into laughter and punched my shoulder

“Relax I’m messing with you!”

I did a snort laugh in relief then died after I burned one of those horrible memories in my brain that randomly come back to haunt you. Right in front of her, I blew a whole snot bubble. She laughed harder and my face grew red. I furiously wiped at my face. Her giggles faded as she searched for something in her purse. She pulled out a small plastic package of those really nice soft tissues. Still wiping my nose, I began apologizing feeling really ashamed.

“Sorry… sorry”

“No, it’s fine haha, here take these”

After cleaning up I could feel her still looking at me, I raised my eyes to meet her and she was just smiling so I spoke still feeling some heat on my cheeks

“What?”

She just started laughing again and I joined her this time, slowly the embarrassment drained from me and I was just laughing at myself, it felt nice.

“Don’t worry, it happens to the best of us. Do you think I carry those around for nothing? I’m practically in allergy season year-round”

I laughed a little more then just smiled at the ground not knowing what to say so I just sincerely said

“Thank you”

The thank you wasn’t all meant for the tissues. Just in general I finally felt good around someone I didn’t know well. She gave me a smirk and started on her tag. After about twenty minutes we finished. I didn’t do anything too crazy, she had various doodles on hers. We waited around 5 minutes for the group to finish

Tom then set up his camera against some rocks and herded us over to pose with our paint. Tom warned us before pushing the button on the camera

“Alright guys, 5 seconds to choose a pose let’s go”

Then he ran but, before he made it to us the flash went off catching his back

“What the hell?”

Tom turned and walked back to the camera and Justice asked him

“You sure you have it at five seconds?”

“Yeah… pretty sure”

After he reset the camera he pressed the button again and ran faster while counting down under his breath 

“5-4-3”

The camera once again interrupted his sprint with a blinding flash. Irving said

“Either you're counting slow, or your camera's busted”

Kristene suggested he just make it ten seconds.

“Yeah okay.”

After resetting the camera once more, Tom ran back and stood with us waiting for the flash still counting under his breath.

“10-9-8-7-6-5-4-”

The flash went off early again catching us off guard. When Tom looked at the photo he decided we needed to retake it and Justice complained

“Come on Tom, the paint’s gonna dry before this picture is finished”

“Just one more I swear, if y'all would stop flinching we'd be done by now… hold on let me get a new angle…”

We groaned as Tom took more time moving the camera to a new spot just a few feet away from its original position. Tom once again pressed the button ran and counted

“10-9-8-7-6-5-4-

Kristene interrupted Tom with a pretty funny comment

“I wonder how many of the photos you take tonight will just be you with your ass to the camera”

The whole group chuckled, Tom ignored, he just kept counting

“-1-0 negative one?”

A few seconds later it flashed, we were all still genuinely smiling from Kristene’s comment so this was probably as good as it gets, besides Tom’s confused look. We continued exploring the caves and a few minutes down we noticed a fun echo when Justice spoke

”How far do you guys think it goes? oes oes oes”

Tom jumped in

”Whoaah, oah oah oah”

”Hey Tommy, try screaming Yes as loud as you can”

Tom obeyed Irving without hesitation

”YES Yes-”

As the echo continued Irving quickly said

”So Tommy, I heard you like dudes butts, is that true?”

The echo continued answering in Tom’s voice

”Yes… yes… yes…”

Tom couldn’t get mad, They burst out in laughter and I tried to hold mine in but, failed, We were nearly on the floor in tears. I looked to see if the girls would be staring at us judgingly but, only Justice refused to at least crack a smile, Fabia quickly stopped laughing when she saw that she wasn’t laughing.

”HELLOO”

We listened to Fabia’s echo fade, something was off. The echo would fade out and start up again at random. In fact, all of ours did, it was just hard to notice unless you yelled. It was interesting to hear. We were all having fun now, us guys still not over Irving's joke. Irving finally said what we were all thinking.

”The cave makes the echo sound weird huh guys?”

Kristene tried to explain

“Yeah, maybe many tunnels are causing it but, I don’t know I’ve never been in a cave before… that’s weird”

Fabia let out a long 

“Helloo”

The echo bounced around, raising and lowering slightly but noticeably. Just after her voice had completely faded we heard it come back faintly but not the same. It was a flat

“Hello?”

We stopped laughing and stood still. Fabia had just started opening up a little more but her voice now sounded timid again as she spoke

“W-What was that?

We stood there stunned just listening. Justice broke the silence

“That one sounded really weird…”

Kristene couldn’t come up with an explanation for that

“Okay, yeah that one was way different”

Tommy cursed under his breath as he pulled his camera out again

“Damn, can’t believe I didn’t get that… Well, looks like we’re ghost hunting now”

Justice and Fabia looked understandably terrified, I could tell they wanted to cut the trip short. Irving tried to reassure us

“Guys, come on… it was probably nothing. I mean, we all heard that… but I’m not ready to leave yet. If something like that happens again, that’ll be all I need to turn back. For now, let’s just make sure we're not jumping at our shadows.”

There was a long pause as we waited for a response. Tommy spoke first

“I’m still game, Kiran?”

I looked at Irving

“Uhh, yeah sure. I can continue.”

“Nice”

Then Kristene perked up

“I’m in too”

Irving almost had a proud look on his face when he heard my answer. We then waited for Justice and Fabias response. Justice spoke sternly

“I mean, I guess I can go a little further but, I mean it. If just one weird thing happens I don’t care how minimal, I’m out.”

Fabia nodded as she spoke and said

“I’ll leave with you, as long as I don’t have to walk back alone I’m fine.”

“Alright, then we’re set… Now let’s split up.”

The whole group burst out in disagreement with Irving's crazy idea

“Hey, hey! Just wait, would you rather we all die, or some of us make it out huh? I’m going towards “the voice”. Who’s with me?”

I’d feel awkward being away from Irving but, I was dreading finding out what made that noise so I said

“I call not going towards whatever that was”

And Kristene said

“Me too”

I was surprised to hear her echo my response, I assumed what we heard hadn't scared her. I glanced at her but looked away when I saw her already looking at me. Irving questioned me

“Well, good luck walking in the dark, where’s your flashlight?”

He had me there, only Tommy and he had brought useful flashlights, the rest of us were stuck with crappy phone lights. Tommy, despite bringing an expensive camera, brought the worst flashlight, it was just barely better than a phone light. Then he said

“I actually wanted to go right over here, it looks like a new area of the cave… B-but It’s not because I’m scared. Besides I’m out to catch a ghost, they never stay where you expect to find them.”

Tommy flicked his flashlight pretending it was a laser gun, after the girls saw how little it actually illuminated, they changed their minds. Irving's light worked great in the cave. So it was just Tommy and I walking down the dark pores of the Earth with a pitiful flashlight illuminating our path to nowhere. I would occasionally trip on small rocks and sliding pebbles since being behind Tommy, I didn’t actually get a live image of what was directly in front of me. He then asked me

“You think we’ll find another entrance?”

I thought about it for a second before answering.

“Not sure, shouldn’t there be a breeze if there was?”

“Maybe… that makes sense.”

We continued for a few minutes with awkward small talk. Then we reached a spot where the cave split again, left and right. Tommy said

“I’ll let you decide this one.”

“Oh, um okay..”

I blinked squinting into the darkness. I could have sworn I saw a light glow that disappeared as my eyes opened in the fraction of a second coming from the right passage. Tommy had been facing away so he didn’t see anything

“Did you see tha… Nevermind. Let’s go right.”

“See what? Did you see something? What was it?”

“Ah, it was probably nothing, just thought I saw a light, It came from the right”

“Right, it is then.”

We walked for a few more minutes, taking our steps nice and slow. I broke the silence with a question that scared myself

“What do you think we’d do if we found someone down here?”

Tommy paused for a moment thinking of what to say

“Well, I guess it would depend on who we’d find… a hurt spelunker, a hobo, junkie, …a killer? What are you trynna freak me out?”

I shrugged my shoulders, forgetting that Tommy couldn’t see me as we walked. Then he asked

“So, got any siblings?”

“No, I’m an only child. Irvings like the closest I got to a brother.”

“Yeah, you two seem tight.”

“Yeah.”

After a tense pause, Tommy spoke hesitantly

“I had a sister when we were younger… man we we would just fight all the time, we’d never get along until-”

Tommy seemed to be entering a trance as if he was speaking out loud to the cave more than me, and then I rudely interrupted him.

“Had?”

“Huh?”

“You said, “Had a sister” right?”

Tom paused walking for just a split second to kick a rock, it skittered over the bumpy floor echoing as it left.

“Y-yeah um, she left.”

“She left? What do you mean?”

“It’s complicated, you see we used to fight all the time until one day… she got into an accident. Someone did a hit and run on her, that’s when she uh, left. She needed to go to a hospital where they could treat her better. It was far, way out where grandma and pa lived, so they basically adopted her while she got better.”

Tommy’s demeanor was completely different now, I didn’t know him all that well but, from the past couple hours since we met, I could tell he was being oddly calm now. All I could say was

“Oh”

“So, when I finally got to see her after she woke up…”

Tom chuckled to himself but the laugh was devoid of any happiness.

“haha… you think we ever fought again?”

“No. Probably not.”

“Never. Well, for a while I couldn’t see her often. I still had to go to school on the regular. We’d visit almost every weekend. She would tell me the best part of her day…”

Tommy took a moment to clear his throat, the vulnerability in his voice was enhanced by the cave’s echo.

“It was watching me come into her room and make her laugh for the whole day. Wish I could have been with her longer. I made up for it by recording some videos for her and sending them. She said she’d spend hours watching everything I’d send. I really loved her man. I hate that it took a tragedy to bring us closer.”

“Oh wow Tom… that's really sweet… do you not see her anymore? What happened”

There was a long pause

“Well, I…”

Tom's voice quivered slightly, I'm not sure if I should have kept on pressing him about her. When he continued his voice returned to its normal state.

“...had to go back to school.”

Then we both froze in unison at the sight of a quick flash of warm light like I thought I’d seen, it wasn’t far and it seemed to be coming from the left wall of the cave. 

“That was it right?”

Tommy was whispering now… I didn’t even want to speak. When Tommy noticed that I said nothing, he turned around and looked at me. I nodded my head. We were completely non verbal now. He flicked his head to the side while raising his eyebrows as if to say “Well, here goes nothin” He switched his camera on then we continued forward. It was about 10 meters away. I continued at the same pace, I could hear my heart pounding in my head the closer we got. What the hell were we about to see? What could possibly explain a light like that? I could start to hear Tommy’s labored breath. His footsteps accelerated, he started leaving me behind, I tried getting his attention but he ignored my whispered shouts

Tommy.. Tom!

He just kept on speeding up until he was in a full jog, still breathing hard. I just couldn’t go any further, the air around us suddenly felt pressurized, like if I just noticed that the weight of the Earth above was finally making its mass known.

Tommy finally reached the wall, it was actually split in two, there was a slit in the wall where he shone the light into. Whatever was on the other side responded with its own light shining back at Tommy. Tommy leaned on the two sides of the slit with his forearms. He stared thoughtlessly like a moth to a flame, the glow intensified as he stared into it.

“Tom!”

He ignored me, I thought I heard whispering, but a breeze had suddenly picked up in the cave distorting the subtle sounds around me. Tommy stared endlessly into the slit, mouth slightly open, a look of unfathomable terror in his face. It looked like his face was paused on the brink of sobbing. I could see a shiny streak of moisture running down his cheek.

“Tori?”

His gaze never left the slit

“What? …Tommy, what are you-”

Tommy slowly dropped his head and looked at the ground in defeat. His arms were shaking as he leaned on them with all his weight. The pressure I felt in my head made it feel like there was a hurricane in the still cave but only a gentle breeze to show for it.  I decided to pull my phone light out because he was far enough that I was surrounded in darkness, my only beacon being the glowing rock.

“I… I shouldn’t…”

His voice was breaking and heavy with sorrow, my eyes squinted and my brow furrowed. When I spoke I could barely hear myself.

“Tommy, are you messing with me?”

I took a step forward tripping on a rock that was the size of and looked like one of those small plastic chairs kids sit on in class. My foot slid across the floor as I caught myself before I could hit the ground. While sacrificing the grip I had on my phone, I braced my arm on the oddly shaped rock and my phone flung towards Tommy landing near him. The commotion must have snapped Tommy out of it. He was now looking at me, his face was streaked red with tears.

 I just stared not knowing what to say. Tommy slowly released his grip from the stone he was leaning on and the glow faded away. I thought he would pick my phone up for me but he just ignored it. Then I noticed most of the nails on his right hand had been either bent or broken off. He was walking back to me now. I tried playing it cool, trying to sound like them in conversation. Tommy was crying so I said

“What’s wrong… um little- …little bitch…?“

I realized how dumb that was as it flopped out of my mouth, Tommy didn’t react. He just stood before me, still crying without a sound. My phone must have been shattered, I wanted to go get it but Tommy was acting too weird. I just stood frozen and listened to his shaky voice as he said

“This was a bad idea, I’m sorry man. I’m just going to go.“

“Alright, yeah sure Tommy. Let’s just go find the othe-“

“No, I’m leaving NOW… I- I’m sorry I just…“

I looked at him for a moment, then the glow slowly faded back. As the glow came back on, Tommy’s eyes reacted to it by widening, as if he could tell it came back, despite facing away. I was out of words. Tommy's face shifted to deep emotional pain, his eyes were on me but, he wasn’t seeing me. 

Tommy began taking quick gasps of air as if he were about to sneeze. He then slowly turned around and began walking back the way he came. His gasps for air turned to long fearful whines. He slowly made his way back to the slit, his arms hung down to the side, he didn’t even use the light, it just hung there uselessly. His whines and whimpers continued as he turned his body to fit the slit in the rock.

I couldn’t see where he was heading so I had no idea exactly how deep or tight it got. I just watched him slowly slide his way through the slit. Soon all I could see was his left arm, holding the flashlight. And then it dropped as he passed through. The light shattered against the hard stone below. It felt like the nerves connecting to my eyes had simply been severed. There was absolutely nothing to see.

“Tom!”

I wasn’t whispering anymore. I let my voice bounce around the cave’s innards freely, I was terrified. I spoke again into the void, voice cracking. I really hoped it was just another prank.

“Tommy, if you’re messing with me, I’m not gonna play into it!”

… There was absolutely no response, the breeze had stopped and the cave was tranquil. I gave up on yelling. My legs felt like they would give at any second

“Tom, I’ll leave you here alone… I-I swear…”

I just stood there, what was I supposed to do? I turned back around in the direction I thought was the way back, but my body refused to move. I waited a couple of minutes, just listening.

\*Drip\*

It was as quiet as it was dark, besides the rhythmic pattern of dripping water. Eventually, I got my feet to move.

\*Drip\*

I shuffled along the stone, scraping away rocks as my feet slid. I held my arms out expecting to hit a wall. I slowly made my way through the cave, occasionally stubbing on my environment

\*Drip\*

I don’t know how long I shuffled through the darkness, the starvation of stimulation made me lose track of reality. My foot eventually hit something that wasn’t so solid, it compressed at my shoe's tap and immediately recoiled as if it moved on its own. I heard stone scraping on stone for a brief moment.

\*Drip\*

My body jumped involuntarily, I shut my eyes tight but could see no difference. A million scenarios ran through my head. 

\*Drip\*

If I run, I might hurt myself, if I stay, something might hurt me. I started seeing some weird shapes, hallucinations caused by the inky black. Odd colors pulsed from within my tightly shut eyes, pressure was rising in my head.

\*Drip\*

“What do I do?”

\*Drip\*

The words echoed in my head

\*Drip\*

Eventually, my legs just tensed up a sprung forward on their own. I ran towards where I believed the nearest wall was. I reached it in seconds and immediately ran my hands along the wall as I jogged forward picking up speed as I went, completely disregarding the possibility of hitting something. I continued like that for several minutes hoping I would find my way back.

Then after a while, I heard a female voice in the dark say 

“What is that?”

Suddenly there were more footsteps tapping on rock followed by gasps and shrieking as I bumped into Irving from behind.

“What the hell?!”

My vision was covered by a blur of red and yellow. I realized then my eyes were still tightly shut, when I opened them I was blinded by Irvings flashlight.

“Kiran…? What are you doing back here, you nearly gave me a heart attack! …Where’s Tom?”

I stood there frozen for a moment just collecting myself.

“Kiran”

“I left Tommy”

“What? What do you mean you left Tom?”

Everyone looked at me confused so I explained what little I could

“I don’t know man, he was just acting weird. I don’t know if he was just trying to scare me or whatever so I just left him, he broke his flashlight, and I think I lost my phone.”

Irving laughed, everyone else was looking at me like I was crazy. Irving spoke while finishing his chuckle

“What? It's been like thirty seconds and you guys are already almost dying?”

“Thirty sec- what?”

I don't know if Irving was messing with me or what but, I was already agitated so his sarcasm wasn't helping. I decided to just take a breath and understand that from their perspective nothing has happened.

“Irving, we walked that way for about twenty minutes, and then Tom started acting weird after we saw a light. I thought he might be trying to prank me again so I just left”

I didn't even believe what I was saying, let alone the rest of the group. Justice threatened to leave as if that would be a huge detriment for us

“If you guys are trying to pull another prank on us, I'm done. I warned y'all.” 

Kristene tried to calm us down saying

“Guys let's just stay calm, we can go find Tommy It's no big deal, we're barely a few steps away from where we started”

Irving was still not buying it. He seemed pretty convinced we were just doing some joke

“Haha, okay Kiran, let's go “find” Tommy. I hope he's not waiting around the corner to scare us”

I looked at Irving even more confused, I looked around, Justice and Fabia looked pale and with the same accusing expression. Kristene stared at me curiously. I was too scared and confused to care about all the eyes on me.

“What..? Irving, no. This is not some prank. Tom was being really weird, I think he was crying or something, I... I don't know what happened… We just saw something in the cave.”

“Oooo, so Tommy found his ghost huh? I hope it doesn’t jump out at us from the dark. Alright man, show the way, where is this ghost?”

I shook my head annoyed at Irving's carelessness but, what else could I do? So I just guided them back to where it all went down. It seemed like we had been walking for way longer than I thought it’d take to find the spot again

“How far is it, Kiran?”

Justice said trying to hide the urgency in her voice

“Umm.. it’s…”

Fabia interrupted before I could finish, not that I even knew what to tell them. I had begun to think that we were lost

“I don’t think he knows where he’s going”

“He’s just stalling for Tom but, seriously, Kiran. Yall can’t have gone that far, is Tom just behind us or something?”

Irving said, reassuring the girls. Kristene continued giving me a curious look, then Justice said

“Is anyone even keeping track of our path? We’re gonna get lost!”

“I am.”

Kristene said

“It’s getting tougher, we really are getting in deep. I think I can get us back out but, there will likely be some guesswork”

Irving then spoke sounding slightly annoyed

“Alright Kiran, it’s time to call it. This prank is taking too long, tell Tom we want to go home”

“Wha- Irving, I told you I’m not joking. And I don’t know how we haven’t found that area yet”

“Kiran. Seriously dude. I’m glad you’re getting more comfortable with Tom and all but, I really just want to go home now. No more games.”

“Irving, I’m not-”

Just before I raised my voice to a shout, the chair-shaped stone caught my eye just barely visible outside Irving's cone of light. Irving followed my gaze

“We’re here”

I said in a whisper. I walked towards the chair then looked where I remembered seeing Tom last.

“Over there”

I pointed and Irving's light followed. There it was, the slit on the left cave wall. Irving looked down at the broken flashlight, it seemed to unsettle everyone.

“He went through that slit right there”

“Alright well let’s drag his ass out, then we can go home”

“Irving wait..”

I wanted to warn him but… of what?

“Right, I’ll make sure I don’t piss my pants when he jumps out”

Irving fearlessly walked to the slit and we followed shortly behind. Just as he began turning the corner he spoke

“Alright Tommy, come get me-”

Irving stared into the slit and paused for a moment, we all waited in tension for him to tell us what he could see. Then he burst out in laughter

“Okay man, you really had me going there for a moment”

“What?”

I said confused, then I walked closer, looked into the slit myself, and… there was... Nothing. It was just more rock, there was no “other side”. My expression darkened with horror. Tommy had disappeared
