~~"just a dream"~~ is a real story happened to me personally, it all started in the 9th class (2018) so i dont remember some details. at first i was a series of dreams ,there another character in the story (i'll call her A) :

* dream 1:

The first night i saw the shadow person, in my dream i was in school talking with "A", i don't remember what we were saying , and for a very short time i notised that there was a humanoid entity kinda short and very big head, pitch dark color on his full body, you coudn't even tell a single detail about him from how dark it was, with white neon-like  glowing eyes, they were unnaturally big, making me rethink whether was it a human or not ,he was looking at us from a distance while trying to hide behing a wall, the moment i saw him he quickly completly hid behing the wall, i woke up sweating and my heart beating creazy fast, it was wierd becasue there was nothing scary about that that time,even in my dream i didn't get scared or anything, so i forgot about it and got back to sleep and didn't told anyone about it thinking it was ~~"just a dream"~~

* dream 2:

I only have vague memories of this dream, i was agin in the school, me and an old man (REALY old) were getting ready for a race between us, "A" was standing in the distance , she seemed upset about something , i don know why but insted of racing the moment the race begun i hit the old man as strong as i can so he doesn't win, As for the shadow person i only remember seeing him in this dreem in a distance aswell but i don't exatly remember where and how, And agin i wook up i was sweating even though the dream was not scared, After this time it seemed wierd seeing the same man(or thing) in two dreams, And seeing "A" in both aswell, And both dreams were not scary but i woke up sweating and heart beating fast.

i told this to only afew of my friend, one of them wasn't intrested or even belived me , other two really belived me, one of them told me you put too much stress on yourself from studying (with was kinda true i was studying hard i was the calss smart kid), the other told me that (english is not our first language i will try my best of translating)

bro you're possesed with jinns you have to go to a sheikh (in english **Exorcism**Â accurding to wikipedia).back then i didn't belive that the jinn can possese people, so i just forgot about it, plus telling my family that i had a jinn and i need to go to a sheikh would result in my family making fun of me for atleast a month so that was not an option,at last i decided to forget about it and pretend it will be gone by itslef ~~"just a dream"~~

* dream 3:

dont rememer anything what so ever about this dream, but i remember i saw him in several more dreams with and without "A" ,back then i thought it has something to do with her, because i saw both in my dream 1 and 2, this is why i had a wierd feeling about "A"  (AND I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WILL THINK THAT I EITHER  LOVE "A" OR I HAVE CRUSH FOR HER BUT I DON'T AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT, SHE WAS LIKE DOUBLE MY AGE !) nothing is wrong it is ~~"just a dream"~~

* dream 4: (\~ after 2018)

this was the first time i was acually screaded in the dream, i was walking in the street that my house is in, the ambient was too creepy it was grayish red, everything was dark but i could still see somehow, i saw it running creazy fast stright to me ,this time it changed form, now it was very long and skinny , still big white glowing eyes and first time he had a big wide open mouth (i dont remember if his hole mouth was glowing or only his sharp teeth), when i saw him i was scared(for the first time in my dreams) and i thing he was also screaming, and i ran as fast as i could away from him after afew steps i fall on the ground and i wook up terrified , still trying to convince myself it is ~~"just a dream"~~

after dream four i saw him in more thatn a dream that i don't remember anything about, most of the dreams where around 2018

* ......? (\~ after 2018)

i was in my house with my brother and father, they were not in the same roon, it was getting time to go to bed, i was sitting on my bed on my phone, i closed the phone to clean my teeth and go to sleep, when i closed my phone and looked to my front, it was there, staring at me , exactly the same form and way of first dream, he was short had big head, pitch dark no detail cold be seen and glowgin big white eyes, i froze in my place and couldn't move from the fear, i couldn't ask for help or do anything , i couldn't even look away, i was staring stright to his eyes, i froze like that for what 10 seconds , he slowly started to hid behind the wall , i was  an absolute moron, what i did was run after him, i have no clew why did i do that i littarly wanted to grab him by the neck. this time when i saw him personally and not inside a dream, i became sure this is not a ~~"just a dream"~~

between  the 3th dream and my real encounter, was a very long time befor seeing him agin, the first afew dream i saw him in my dream on a weekly basis, but he disapeared for seemingly no reson and got back in real life

* Last dream ( \~ after 2020):

i was in our neighborhood knocking on my neighbors door, i was hearing noises from his house i was pretty sure they were home, i took a peek inside a house since the door was abit open (despite this being wrong) , i saw him looking at me stright in the eyes, this time he was angery, i knew this only from his eyes i also got sceared and wook up like allways ,~~"just a dream"~~
