My wife and I share a deep and fulfilling bond. Our cozy home provides us with a sanctuary from the outside world, and we relish in planning for the future, including the possibility of having children. We enjoy doing activities together, and our life is filled with moments of joy and contentment.

However, a few days ago, something strange happened. We were in the kitchen having dinner, and I was telling her about my day at work when she suddenly stopped me and said, "100, 99, 98..."

I was taken aback and asked her what she was doing. She continued to count down slowly from 100 to 90, as if in a trance. When she finally stopped, I asked her if everything was okay, but she seemed confused and had no recollection of counting down.

"What just happened?" I asked, trying to hide my concern.

"I don't know," she replied, looking bewildered. "I felt like I was in a dream or something."

I could tell something was wrong, but I didn't want to push her too hard. We finished our dinner, but the strange incident lingered in my mind.

The next day started like any other day. My wife and I both went to work, and we exchanged messages throughout the day. However, as I was making my way home from work, a sense of unease began to settle in my stomach. The events of the previous day replayed in my mind, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off.

When I got home, my wife was already there, and we greeted each other with a warm embrace. We sat down for dinner, and the smell of her delicious cooking filled the room. We talked about our day, and everything seemed normal until suddenly, her eyes glazed over, and she started counting down again.

"76, 75, 74..." she murmured, in a monotone voice.

I tried to snap her out of it, but it was like she was in a deep hypnotic trance. I was getting increasingly worried and started to panic.

"Honey, can you hear me? Wake up!" I shook her gently, but she was unresponsive.

I watched in horror as she counted down, hoping that she would snap out of it soon. When she finally stopped, she looked at me with a blank expression and asked, "What happened?"

"You were counting down again," I said, my voice quivering with fear. "Are you okay?"

She looked at me with confusion in her eyes and shook her head. "I don't remember anything. What's going on?"

I didn't know what to say. I felt helpless and scared, wondering what was happening to my beloved wife.

The next day, I woke up feeling anxious and frightened. The events of the previous days had taken their toll on me, and I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. I went to work, but I couldn't concentrate on anything. My colleagues noticed that I was acting strange, and they tried to ask me what was wrong.

"Is everything okay?" One of them asked.

"Yeah, I'm just a little tired," I lied, not wanting to burden them with my problems.

When I got home, my wife was already there, and I could tell she had noticed my troubled expression.

"What's wrong, honey?" She asked, placing a hand on my shoulder.

"I'm just worried about you," I admitted, feeling tears welling up in my eyes. "I don't understand why you keep counting down. What happens when you reach zero?"

She looked at me with concern, but also a hint of confusion in her eyes. "I don't know," she said. "I wish I could explain it, but I can't."

"I think we should see a doctor," I suggested. "Maybe they can figure out what's going on."

But she was reluctant, insisting that it was just a temporary brain glitch and that it would go away on its own. We agreed to wait until she reached zero, and then we would seek medical help if needed.

That night, during dinner, she counted down again, this time stopping at 69. It was becoming a pattern, and it scared me to think what would happen if she ever reached zero.

"Do you remember anything?" I asked her, hoping for some answers.

"No," she replied, looking frustrated. "I don't know why this keeps happening."

I could see the fear in her eyes, and I knew if it would not go away, we couldn't just wait and hope for the best. We needed to take action if it was necessary.

So it has been going on for days now and she always stops at random numbers. I cannot even see patterns in those numbers. Yesterday she stopped at number 7. I am expecting that tonight she reaches zero, and we will finally find out what happens. I finished my work in the afternoon, my wife is preparing dinner in the kitchen at the moment. I have to admit, the air is tense, and I can feel my heart racing with anticipation.

I canâ€™t help but wonder what the night will hold. Will my wife experience some sort of cataclysmic event when she reaches zero? Or will something really unexpected happen? We are both anxious to find out.

I will edit this entry soon to let you guys know what happened.
