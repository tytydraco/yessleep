Things have been weird ever since I watched Creepcast’s podcast video on the left/right game.

 It’s hard to describe the way my mind has become fuzzy, and way my dreams are of an orange red hazy place filled with something like dust particles hang heavy and thick in the air. This place I keep coming back to is filled with an emptiness that expands from deep within me, outward, like a shadow or an echo that’s deep and booming, and never ending. The feeling of it is like terror, cold and fearsome in my bones, like the worst winter days where no snow falls, and the cold pierces like knives. Everything slowed, and out of place.

 I’m trying to understand it, but every time I try to grasp it, it slips from my fingertips. It becomes a bleary thing, and a mess in my head. The memories are not tangible. They feel like that place in-between sleep and wakefulness, not quite solid or real, not entirely unreality.

 That’s a good place for it, *this unreality.*

 I can handle the dreams, I can handle the hazy memories, I can push them away. I’ve been doing something similar my whole life. But last night something strange happened, that won’t let me do that anymore.

 I was laying in bed, half-way to sleep, the upstairs creaking as my neighbors walked around. The outside of the street, dim and unappealing, glowing streetlights streaming through the top of closed my curtains, only this time the streetlight glow began to flicker as I was half-way to sleep. And I realized that the slow shuffling sound was not just upstairs, but more pronounced, solid, like the snow crunching under feet, outside. Outside by the window where I sleep.

 *Crunch.*

*Crunch.*

 *Crunch.*

 My heart began to pound. It’s just the neighbors, I tell myself, but my heart grows louder, and I’m stuck in this place.

 And then there’s a familiar voice from behind me saying, “don’t you remember me, Rita?”

 Her long black hair tickles my nose, my face. I breathe her in. Her scent is familiar to me.

 It smells of childhood, of puberty, of that awful time in a teenage girl’s life between twelve and fifteen.

 It smells like period blood, and screams at sleepovers, and the nasty looks we gave each other when we thought the other wasn’t looking.

“M- Mel?”

 I turn over quickly, awake, alert, and terrified.

Eyes wide, and panicked, as I turned the lamp on.

 Hands scratching at my face, but her hair is gone, her voice, her smell. She’s nowhere in sight.

I haven’t seen her in ten years.

 My chest is heaving, and it comes back, all my memories, real, tangible, they taste like nosebleeds, and terror white hot. Melted snow on the back of my neck, ash burning like a hissing stove splattered with steam.

 When we were fourteen years old, we played a game.

It wasn’t the left/right game.

 It was something else, that took the internet by storm, or at least, the creepy corners we would dwell in at the time. It was called the elevator game. Maybe you’ve heard of it, maybe it’s a dull thudding tug of some long forgotten memory in the back of your mind, a gentle nudging reminder of something you’ve suppressed. Forgotten about.

 Or maybe you remember, because maybe you got off on the first floor. You went down, instead of up.

 Come to think of it, that was the last time I ever saw her.

My best friend, Mellissa. *Mel.*

 I’m writing this now, because I need to get it out. I need to make sense of these memories that are coming back to me so cruelly, that they are making me hallucinate some sleep paralysis thing masquerading as my once best friend.

 And before you ask, no she didn’t vanish with this game, or at least I don’t think she did.

No, I remember.

 She moved away, back to her reserve, but when she was in the city, she stayed with her sister. She called me once, and then after that she never called me again.

 But right before she moved, we were still the same best friends. Hanging out, sleepovers as we lived across town, and it was more convenient this way for the adults in our lives who had to drive us.

 If you were a fourteen year old girl in 2012, or 2013, as we were, you might remember all the scary stories we would tell each other at sleepovers. Or the way we would play those games, like the red book game, or bloody mary.

 We did all of them, we loved them, couldn’t get enough. And that was sort of the problem.

It wasn’t enough.

 We wanted more.

*I* wanted more.

 And so when I stayed up all night once, scouring creepy blogs on tumblr, looking for something as we hung out watching old movies downstairs in my parents house, sneaking liquor out of the cabinet, and sharing stories about the boys we liked and who was breaking up with who- I found it.

 The elevator game.

“Hey, check this one out.” I told Mel.

 She leaned over, her dark hair tickling my face, her warm body- she was always so warm, pressing in closer. “Huh, never heard of it.”

“Wouldn’t it be fun? I mean, it looks so cool, all those rules… we’d have to remember all of them, memorize it. We could go on like a little adventure, if it worked of course.” I don’t know why I was so excited. It just felt exciting, like something otherworldly, special, you know?

 Then again, I believed it all, I was the naïve one, as Mel always used to tell me- and to my chagrin tricked me a few times into believing some of her wilder stories to see my reactions.

 She shrugged, not as convinced as me, but admitted, “it looks cool.”

“We’d have to plan it well, you know? Get some supplies, and stuff. Like, a flashlight, maybe some food. Make sure we have everything memorized, just in case.” I told her, thinking I was so smart for figuring this out, being completely prepared, ready.

 Mel wasn’t as enthused, but she smiled at me, and there was something endearing in that gaze, that made me feel terribly seen. My heart jumped.

“Yeah.” She said, soft, warm. “We’ll need other stuff too, like maybe a lighter would be a better idea? A flashlight too, sure, and some food, but we should have some kind of weapon.”

 Guns were out of the question.

“A knife.”

“Yep. I’ll get my brother’s pocket knife.”

“I’ll get my mine.” I confirmed.

 We started planning that night.

 We realized we’d need an elevator with at least thirty three floors, that part would be more tricky, but downtown, there was this old hotel. It was huge, and it had the amount of floors needed, the only problem is getting there without our parents knowing. Sneaking in past the reception desk, and then doing everything we needed to, going up and down the elevator without getting caught.

 The rules were specific, absolute.

There can’t be anyone else in the elevator except those participating.

 At the time of sleepover, and at the time of writing this, it seemed just another young girl’s fancy. Something fun and kind of creepy, and otherworldly that gives one that excited buzz, to do during a sleepover. Just like all the other creepy games, and stories we’d do in the past.

 Even typing this now, thinking back on it, I still have that memory, that leap to the phone call from her sister’s house, and never seeing her again.

 But between that leap, that dark space, is something else now.

 It’s us playing red robin a month later, me telling my parents I would be at Mel’s house. Mel telling her mom she would be at mine.

 We met up at the school by my house. Mel had her brother drop her off there, and I told me parents that Mel’s brother and her were coming to get me. I snuck out before they knew what was happening.

 Now, here we were.

“I called us a cab.” I tell her.

 She nods, her full bag of our ‘supplies.’ “Good.”

 I had a similar bag on my back, and felt the nerves then, the apprehension tight in my gut. “Are you sure you want to do this?”

 We’ve talked about this before, instinct, or just the small voice in the back of head telling you when danger was near. Telling you that something was going to happen before it did. We both had it. That feeling.

 In fact there’s been a few times, where I thought about her calling, and then she would, or vice versa.

 We said we should always listen to that voice, that it’s there for a reason.

Right now, I hear it.

 Mel looks at me, something flickering in her eyes that says she feels it too, but then she nods, smiling, eyes growing softer. “It’s just a dumb game, right? And we have it all memorized, come on, Rita, don’t be so naïve.”

 I can tell she’s trying to comfort me, but her face screams apprehension, as her hand touches my arm, making my heart jolt again.

 I swallow thickly. “Are you sure?”

The cab shows up before she can answer.

\-

 We sit tense in the back of it, bags to our chests all the way downtown to the hotel. The sun is already slipping behind the horizon. It’s late, it’s hot, and its summer. We look to one another, as I had over the cash to the driver, and then step out of the vehicle.

“Remember our plan.” She recounts.

“I’ll go in first, scout it out, and then I’ll give you the signal, if we’re good, otherwise plan B.” I explain.

 Mel nods, and smiles, as I disappear into the hotel.

 Downtown… isn’t the greatest place in our city. It’s worse now, in the present time, but back then, it was a little better, but not by much. Still, it’s surprising to think how there was no bodyguard on duty at the time, just a receptionist who is looking down at her desk, shuffling papers.

 I steal myself, my excuse on my tongue as I step forward, but strangely, as I do so, someone calls from the back, “Nancy?”

 And without her even seeing me, she turns, disappearing into the back, leaving the front unattended.

 Odd.

 Still, I’m not going to look my luck in the eyes, I turn back, wave to Mel who quickly sneaks in. She looks to the empty desk, and grins. ‘let’s go,’ I mouth, and we disappear down the hall of the lobby, turning a corner into the first floor where all the carpet has seen better days, some seventies type style, the walls an off-white, and the door trimmed with fake gold.

 We stand before the large elevator doors, side by side, a wave of apprehension, fear mixed in. My palms sweat, my heart races, but there’s excitement. Mel looks to me, and I look back, and it’s all I need.

 We look to the elevator, and it’s me who shakily presses the button to go, ‘up.’

I almost scream.

 A man steps out, a bag in hand, we both startle.

He grins, wide and toothy. “Excuse me, ladies.” He leaves the elevator.

 My heart is pounding so loudly, and Mel is just as nervous next to me, she exhales shakily, and I feel her fear like it’s my own.

“Fuck.” She mutters.

“No shit.” I say back.

“Should we…?” She questions.

“Better to wait for the next one.” I tell her, and wait for the doors to close, before I press the button again.

 This time there is no one, and we get on.

But just as we do so, I feel it.

 Something heavy pressing into my chest, and the realization as we make take the first step in the game, pressing the first floor button as the doors shut, of what I just saw, hits me squarely in the chest. So hard, I almost can’t breathe.

 That man had no eyes.

The doors ding open, and Mel presses the fourth floor button.

 It’s too late.

We’re in it now, and there’s now way out, until we finish it.

“Mel?” I say, soft, dangerously quiet, voice etched in nerves.

“Shh.” She whispers. “You know the rules. We’re almost back to the fifth floor.” She presses the second floor button. “I know. I know, Rita. It’s okay, I’m prepared. I know how much this means to you. We’ll be okay.”

“But he… he…”

“I know. His eyes were pure white.”

 My breath steals, that’s not right.

 They were black, empty, nothing there at all.

“No, I-”

“Shh.”

 The fifth floor dings.

Something else steps into the elevator.

 My mouth snaps shut, I look away, my heart hammering.

 I remember the rules, the game, I know what we memorized as the woman walks onto the elevator. Her heals clanging loudly as she stands there, my eyes turning onto the ground, right at our feet. Anywhere but at her face.

 You’re not supposed to look.

You’re not supposed to talk to her.

 Her heals are black, long, and unnaturally square.

 It reminds me of that story, about witches, and their shoes, and the terrifying nature of childhood.

 The elevator moves, and my heart pounds so loudly, I can barely breathe.

 It’s not going down, I realize with a sinking bone dreading realization. It pools in my gut like nausea and the metallic taste of blood across my tongue.

 It’s going up.

 She speaks to me, not Mel, the thing. The it. It’s not human. I can feel it, without knowing the rules, that instinctual thing, that voice in the back of my head, the way my hair stands on end, and the fear overrides almost every sane sensation.

 It says to me, “what’s wrong?”

I watch her feet turn, no longer pointed away, but towards.

 She steps closer, my back presses into the elevator. This was not part of the game we read, or the rules. She’s not supposed to say this yet. She’s not supposed to be this close.

 My heart hurts, without how fast its going.

“Why won’t you look at me?” She continues.

 Her voice doesn’t sound like a monster, it sounds like a human. That’s worse.

It sounds warm, almost, inviting.

 It goes from shrill, and high-pitched, to something warm, and familiar, and aching.

 It sounds like my mother after my nightmares when I was a child, the ones that kept me unable to sleep for days, only able to rest when she was near, holding me. Those few moments were so precious, it was the only time she really ever loved me, I think.

“Sweetie, why won’t you look at me?”

*…mom*

 My head shifts, I almost look.

A hand clamps down on mine, so tightly, it’s going to bruise.

 It’s too warm, and hot, and too familiar to be my mom’s.

It’s Mel.

 I can feel everything in that touch without having to look at her.

 Her thumb rubs soothingly, it’s anchoring. It grounds me. *‘it’s okay,’* she says silently with that touch, ‘*I’m here.’*

 Mel’s the only person I’ve ever really loved.

Writing this out in the present, it’s still true.

“What’s wrong, sweetie? Tell mommy so she can fix it.”

 I know what I’ll see if I look.

I’ll see this thing wearing my mother’s face.

 The elevator dings, and I see the heals clang back, stepping off into the thirty third floor.

 Mel’s hand squeezes in mine, pulling, firm and unrelenting. “We have to go.” She says. “We’re here.”

 We step out from our world, into another.

 It’s an orangey red hazy glow. The air is thick, and dense, and it’s like smoke, but not. It doesn’t hurt to breathe in, just a soft burn that fades quickly. But there’s something like ash in the air, it falls all around, melts against skin.

 My eyes blink, opening in surprise as I look to the city around us, as I turn around and see the elevator has disappeared. As I realize we’re not longer in the hotel. We’re on the roof of it.

“What the fuck.” I whisper, hoarse.

 Mel’s in front of me then, finger to her lips.

I stop talking immediately, and listen to what she’s clearly trying to make out.

 It’s low at first, a soft humming of a million voices that don’t make sense. It hurts only a little, like a small papercut, but it’s slowly getting louder, and louder. They’re little knifes, they’re deeper cuts into my ears, down into my soul. It physically aches and makes me sick. The nausea and dread grow as it gets louder, and louder. And with it clarity.

 Screams.

Hundreds, and thousands, tormenting.

 It sounds like the funeral I went to where baby cousin John died by a freak accident. His father thought it would be fun to set him on his shoulders as they went out on ATV’s. A fun, normal activity where I live. Or it should have been. His father forgot about the low tree branches on the south hillside.

 His head came completely off.

 That wasn’t the worst part to me. It was the sound his mother made after. The shrill shrieking, grief-stricken, soul churning sounds. She stayed with us for a while, before we put her in the hospital. Every night, it would echo. Her agony.

 Here, in this place, it surrounds us, and it’s not just hers. It’s everyone’s.

 I fall to the ground, hands covering my ears, Mel doing the same, the blood pouring between fingertips, dripping onto the top of the building we stand on.

 In the distance, a red cross burns brightly. Just like the stories said.
