Now I know what most of you are going to be thinking. “Oh, he’s only posting this for engagement”, but I need help.

I’ve not long started making content for TikTok, it’s been just under a year now. I’d thought about it for a while, and when it seemed like everyone I knew started doing it, I figured, why not me too?

Coming up with an idea was a struggle. I didn't want to follow the latest trends, like my friends. The idea of doing silly dance moves or making AI brainrot was never really that appealing. But still, I wanted in.

After spending what felt like hours editing it, I can still vividly remember my excitement when I posted my first video. It was me, lip synching to my favourite song while headbanging as though I was front and centre at a concert. 

At the time, I was thrilled with it; I’d put a load of effort into the effects, and I’d actually created something. Now looking back at it… it makes me want to heave.

It wont come as a surprise to any of you, but it never really took off.

As disheartened as I was, I didn’t let that stop me. But after trying everything, from following the dancing trends, as much as I hated myself for it, to trying out cooking videos, nothing seemed to work.

I was stuck in limbo, watching my friends around me starting to gather small followings while I sat there with a meagre stack of views. Try as I might, nothing took. 

One night, after yet another friend managed to get thousands of views, I’d got to the point where I’d considered dropping it, just giving up. But then I started leaning into the ghost content. You know, spooky stories, urban legends and that sort of thing. 

I wasn't really into them myself. It wasn’t that they scared me exactly, they just made me feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes. Other times, some of them came across as downright stupid. 

Anyway, I tried everything, crime skits, ghost stories, even those recycled AI legends. Some stuff hit, some didn’t. But eventually, I found a groove: low-budget reenactments with my friends. They seemed to get more views. Nothing major, but way more than I’d ever had before.

So that’s how I settled on my niche. I started narrating summaries of real-life events, murders and shootings, that kind of thing. I record the voiceover separately and put it over a video of my friends acting out whatever the story was about.

It was super low budget, and again, it's probably well within the cringe category, but it worked. I’d still throw in the odd urban legend and stuff, but the summaries were where I spent most of my time.

Most of them I found online, getting ChatGPT to give me a quick, bullet-point summary that I could turn into a script. Like I said, I’m not really into this stuff, so I didn’t much care for the details. I just wanted to make videos.

Anyway, I did this for a few months, and it seemed like everything was going great. I seemed to be getting more popular and even had a few dedicated fans. I was making about two videos every week, just pushing out content as fast as I could. I can’t remember half of them, to be honest with you, but a few stuck with me. 

For example, there was one about a group of students who’d noticed what looked like the blurry outline of a man in the background of every photo they’d ever taken together. They laughed it off as visual distortion until they looked back through their old photos, and he was there, even in childhood ones. Same stance. Same trenchcoat. When they tried to crop him out, he appeared closer in the next picture. That one got under my skin a little, but it was a great idea for a video.

I got my one friend, Jake, to dress up as the man in the background, gave him a large trench coat that I borrowed from my dad and told him to stand as awkwardly as he could while my other friends posed for a photo. He didn’t disappoint, standing as straight as he could while cocking his head at an awkward angle, looming there in the background. Wide eyed, he slapped on the creepiest grin he could think of. He looked like an idiot, but it was unnerving.

We filmed that one and I posted it, not expecting anything out of the ordinary, but hoping that this might be the one that went viral… 

It did just about as well as the others, but that didn’t bother me. I carried on making them. There was one about a Craigslist killer who dragged people down into his basement before killing them. That one did okay, I think because I added static and made Tom crawl up the stairs like a freak. But again, it didn’t take off as much as I wanted it to.

I kept this up, posting about twice a week and steadily growing, it became the new normal for me, and I could think of nothing better than getting to hang out with my friends, making stupid videos and having a laugh.

Then it happened… one of them blew up. I came home one afternoon to find my phone pinging near constantly as I got notification after notification. My heart leapt into my chest as I unlocked the screen and saw they were all comments from TikTok.

Looking at my view counts in TikTok Studio, they’d exploded. I could barely contain my excitement as I flicked through the overview, taking in the numbers. My older ones were getting more views too, and people were going through my entire profile.

My phone pinged again as another person commented on one of them. This was the most interaction I’d ever had; it was amazing. I could barely contain myself as I clicked on it. “Love this stuff!!!” it read.

It was finally happening, I was going viral. Eagerly, I responded, thanking them and telling them I hoped they’d enjoy my new videos too. Flicking through the rest of the comments, there were more of the same, people showing their appreciation for my little passion project. But intermingled with them, there were some odd ones too.

“yo what’s that guy at 0:33? #trenchman?”

“dude you got a recurring character now? he’s in all your vids 😂”

“is that supposed to be part of the skit??”

“that humming… creepy af”

I had no idea what they were on about. Loads of people kept commenting on how they liked the recurring character, how they thought it was creepy. I was confused. What recurring character? I’d never used the same story twice, hell, I’d never used the same costume twice for fear of being repetitive. And what were they talking about, humming?

Bemused, I clicked on the video. It started up just as I remembered, with me and my friends running in a field, pretending to be stuck in The Field where Time Stops, but sure enough, there was something there. In the background was what looked like Jake, dressed in that dreary trench coat. I couldn’t make out his face properly, he was all the way at the other end of the field, but I his head was cocked to the side just the same.

I could barely believe what I was seeing. We’d filmed that video with the trench coat a few days before that, but Jake hadn’t been there at all in the field; he’d been ill when we’d filmed it. At least, that’s why I assumed he’d ghosted us. Come to think of it, he still hadn’t got back to me, he’d just left me on read.

I looked back to the figure again, the likeness was uncanny. There was a sound, too, one that I don’t remember putting there. It was like he was humming this tune, it was really bad. It sounded so out of tune, and there was almost no rhythm to it. Something about it set my teeth on edge, like nails running down a chalkboard. I had no idea what this was.

Shaking off the chill running down my spine, I tried to be rational about it. This was just Jake messing with me, had to be. This was his idea of a joke, standing in the background and ruining my TikToks, then adding in that stupid humming and reuploading them somehow.

Still, something seemed off about the whole thing. The comments weren't just for this video, they were on several of them, even my older ones.

Flicking back through more and more of them, my blood ran cold. He was there, in every single one. Always the same, always standing there, in the background, head cocked to the side and the coat draping his thin frame. He was humming that same, god awful tune. It was grating on my eardrums.

There was no way. He couldn’t have been pulling this prank for that long. He was even in some of them himself. He had to have been editing them, adding himself back in and reuploading them. But how had he gotten access to my profile?

Jumping back to TikTok Studio, I checked the upload times of each of them, expecting them all to show last night. They were unchanged, exactly as I’d uploaded them all of those weeks and months before. 

My head was swimming. How the hell had he done this? I could have sworn he was never there when we filmed them, not dressed like that at least. I’d have noticed!

Deciding to nip this in the bud and call Jake out on his shenanigans, I tried to call him. My heartbeat raced as the phone connected, ringing several times until it hit voicemail. I tried again a couple more times, but it just kept ringing out.

Swapping apps, I thought I’d try to catch him on Insta, but when I checked his profile, there had been no activity from him in days. He posted pretty regularly, but he’d been showing as offline for nearly a week now. What the hell was going on?

All I could do was sit there, flicking back through the old TikToks. I was so confused.

It was odd, although it looked kind of like Jake, something was off. He looked taller, thinner. I could make out his features slightly more, still blurry, but defined enough for me to make out the wide eyes and creepy grin. It felt almost like the more I flicked through my videos, the closer he came to the screen. It was stupid, I know, but it was like he was making his way towards me.

The more I looked at him, the more I scrolled, the more it felt like his eyes were piercing into me, his mouth unmoving as he hummed. I needed to look away, to get this all out of my head until I could speak to Jake..

I started scrolling aimlessly through my FYP, trying to take my mind off of it. I’d made it no less than two videos before I nearly dropped my phone. 

He was there, still getting closer… and he definitely wasn't Jake. A chill ran down my spine as I took in the gaunt face staring at me through the screen. I could make out the stretched features clearly now, his skin taut across his face. Other than the trench coat and the way that he was leaning, he looked nothing like my friend. He was standing there, motionless, the scenes behind him acting out, oblivious as he blocked them from view. 

The more I scrolled, the closer he got, to the point where it felt like his face was inches away from the screen, almost pressing against it.

And the sound, that god awful sound. The humming was so loud now, it drowned out any other sound in the videos. I could feel the speakers in my phone vibrating in my hand.

Frantically locking my phone, I hurled it away, throwing it across the room toward my bed. What the hell was happening? I needed to relax, to take my mind off of this; I was obviously having some kind of breakdown.

Staggering into the living room, I flopped down on the sofa. Turning on my TV, I was ready to watch some mundane shows. They didn't need to be anything in particular, I just needed a distraction.

I turned to adjust the cushion next to me, trying to get as comfortable as I could, when I heard it…

That grating… toneless… humming..

Screaming, I fumbled with the remote. It took me three tries to press the power button, but when I felt it under my thumb, I pushed it down as hard as I could. I caught a glimpse of that face, the eyes staring dead at me as the screen faded to black. I hurled the remote across the room, hearing it shatter on the floor as the batteries fell out from the impact.

This wasn't real, there was no way this could be real. I was seeing things! Something was happening to me, but there was no way he’d been there too, not on the TV. That was impossible.

I decided to avoid screens for the next few hours, getting something to eat and deciding to read a book instead. I’d powered through around five chapters, and the light in the room had started growing dim. The sun was setting outside, sending purple and orange hues cascading over the laminate flooring.

Tiredness had started to set in, as well as what I expect was an adrenaline crash from earlier. Getting to my feet, I shuffled towards the window, ready to close the curtains and call it a night. I just wanted to forget about what had happened this afternoon.

As I reached out to draw the nearest ones, I stopped dead in my tracks. Stumbling backwards, I nearly fell as I screamed.

He was there, just outside! His face was pressed right up against the thin layer of glass, squashed against it like he was trying to push himself through it, distorting his already gnarled features. That thin pane was all that separated us. 

Although slightly distorted, the same, tuneless humming clawed at my ear drums. My mind froze as I scrambled frantically, trying to get back, to get away. All the while the humming seemed to get louder and louder in my head, drowning out the sounds of my thumping feet and pounding heart. It seemed to grow, ripping its way through my mind like a mosquito whining inside your skull. 

All the while, I was fixed on those eyes. They seemed to bore into me, the pupils locked onto mine. They wormed their way through me, digging deeper. I felt a crawling under my skin growing more and more intense with each passing second.

Finally snapping back to my senses, I ran screaming into my bedroom and slammed the door. Dragging my chair behind it to hold it closed, I ran to the far corner. Shaking, I hid there, my heart pounding. This couldn’t be real, I was going mad. There was no way he could be outside my window. It was a second floor apartment. It wasn’t possible.

A soft pinging from a few feet away startled me, breaking through the panic bubbling in my mind as my phone screen lit up. Shakily inching over to where I’d tossed it, I fumbled with it, dreading what I would see when I unlocked it.

To my relief, the usual screen met my eyes. I’d been half expecting to see the man's face again, but there was no sign of him. There were notifications, though, so many notifications. Comments, all of them, from TikTok.

With a shaking finger, I clicked on the first one, my hair standing on end as that humming sound seemed to fill the air again. I tried my hardest to ignore it as I read through notification after notification, all saying the same thing, all about that man.

“he’s in MY video now… the hell???”

“this isn’t funny anymore. I can’t get him off my FYP”

“How do you turn this off? he’s in the way”

“I muted my phone and he’s still humming. WTF?!”

“I tried blocking you but he’s still showing up. I think he’s in my mirror.”

The humming was so loud now, it was almost deafening. I could barely hear myself think. The skin on my scalp tightened as I fought back tears. Scanning the room again, I half expected to see the man standing behind me, his eyes boring into me as he grinned. 

There was nothing; the room was just as it had always been, other than the chair now propped under the door. Turning back to my phone, there were more comments, thousands of them. My blood ran cold as I realised… they must be seeing the same thing as me.

A soft knocking, gentle and calm, filled the air. Snapping my attention back to my room, I whirled around as a new wave of terror washed over me. I was alone in the house, my parents were out and wouldn't be back for another few hours. But the knocking came again, that soft rapping at my bedroom door.

Without even realising I was doing it in the first place, I stopped humming…

I don’t know why or how, but he’s just outside. It’s got to be him. I can't go back out there. I don’t know what to do, what does he want? 

He’s knocking at the door again now, in time with that god awful tune…

What if he’s still here when my parents get home?

The humming keeps getting louder, I can’t get it out of my head… Oh god… please help… The views keep going up…
