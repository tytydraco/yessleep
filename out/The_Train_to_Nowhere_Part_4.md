How long have I been riding this train?

How many times had I used this train to escape reality?

The two questions echoed in my mind as I boarded the train yet again.

The trip to visit Phil and Sue had not eased my mind of the Train to Nowhere, it had instead only grown the craving to journey farther. The allure of seeing all it had to offer was consuming my every waking thought. When I worked I would count the seconds until I was done so I could find my way to the train and ride off to distant lands. 

Each time I boarded The Conductor would greet me with open arms and a smile just as wide. The faces of my fellow passengers began to fade in the recollection of my mind but The Conductor’s face only strengthened.

The Conductor’s skin was the pale and porous form of porcelain, and apparently just as brittle. Greasy hair neatly pulled back sat under his worn blue hat. His suit was neatly pressed and fitted with ivory buttons that glimmered with the same shine as his teeth. A dingy copper name badge that was impossible to read other than the words ‘Chief Conductor’ The only seemingly auspicious warning of any ill intent was the white leather gloves that always had a mist of blood staining them no matter how often he would wipe his hands in his embroidered handkerchief. 

During the years I had spent as a passenger on the train I had never asked the conductor what his name was. A piece of information I had found neither important or necessary to ask for during all of these years. Whenever he was referred to it was always as The Conductor, even when someone would ask him what the upcoming destination would be.

“Excuse me,” I said after he passed, announcing our next stop in Derry.

“How can I be of assistance, sir?” He asked with an etched smile always unfaltering.

“I…I wanted to ask for your name. I just realized that in all the years of riding I have never asked,” I nervously asked, dreading that I had.

“No bother at all, sir. Although you simply have to read it on my name badge if you were truly curious and didn’t want to ask,” The Conductor replied, gesturing to his dingy copper plate.

Just as I was about to remark on the condition of the badge and the difficulty in deciphering it, the dingy copper plate was replaced with a pristine badge that said the name…

*R. V. Regent*

“Regent? Isn’t that the name of one of the founding families of the town?”

“Yes it is. My family has been part of this town since the very beginning. While there have been a few bad apples along the way, we do our best to serve the community.

I nodded as the man walked back towards the front of the train, a whistle sounding out from his as he stepped in motion with the sway of the train. A cold sweat stood on the back of my neck as I glanced around the stagecoach. Everyone around me stared at me like I had just skinned a cat instead of simply asking for the name of the conductor.

I turned my head away from everyone and waited to reach my destination.

Another call from the engine sang out to me. Drawing me closer. Regent stood aside with an arm gesturing me to the front.

I stepped past the conductor and placed a hand on the velvet curtain. The thick softness of the material gave little resistance as I began to pull the curtain aside.

Just as I could see the shadows puppeteering the train to far-off places, I let go of the material and turned back towards the conductor.

“Another time, perhaps,” Regent said as he motioned me back to my seat at the back of the train.

As I took my seat, I heard a commotion from outside of the train. A group of Russian peasants had captured someone who had failed to board the train in time. The mass of starving people did not yield the screams of not being the Tsar. They only pulled and ripped at his clothes and flesh. Slowly, they turned from people into amorphous blobs of ravenous beasts, pecking and clawing and biting as the train pulled farther and farther away, leaving the massacre far from view.

I shook my head and put my hands on my head to steady myself.

I didn’t remember reboarding the train after I had gotten off. I barely even remember where I had gotten off. It was someplace sunny with celebration in the air, but the entire time I was there, I only wanted to be back on the train. Slowly, I could remember standing aboard and staring towards the engine as it continued its return. I had stared towards the front unmoving, listening to the most wonderful melody.  The song was beautiful, and I wanted to hear more, and I knew I wouldn’t be able to hear it from my seat. 

There was something calling me to the front, and now the conductor was welcoming me forward.

I was welcome to see the driver as an invited guest, something that I had always assumed was certain to end in my death as none who had been forced to the front ever returned. The only remnants I had ever seen were the bloodied gloves of the conductor when he would return.

What I found the most confusing was the shape that I had seen in the shadows behind the curtain.

It wasn’t the sluggish blob or porcelain figure that had been the guesses of myself and the others that I had rode the train with.

It had looked like a person that was so oddly familiar.

I was almost certain that the figure could have been a triplet that I had never known before.

As I returned to the town and walked back home, I tried to put the day’s events out of my mind. The Train to Nowhere was calling me more and more often. I needed to take some time away from it before I boarded and never returned. The Holidays were fast approaching and Sue and Phil would be back soon. Their familiar faces would be a nice distraction and with them here, perhaps I could avoid the call.

I placed my hands in my coat pocket and felt the glossy material within. I removed it from my pocket and revealed the SIlver Ticket granting an express ride to nowhere.

Once Phil and Sue returned, I would see where Nowhere really was.
