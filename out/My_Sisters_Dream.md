Before I start this I want to say that this is a 100% true story that happened to my sister, and that my family has a very very weird history with dreams especially me, my sister, our mom, and my sisters dad. My sister and her dad definitely have it the worst though.

My sister was always I guess you'd say "in tune" with spiritual and paranormal things. She was the kid that always claimed to see ghost and would talk to people who weren't there. My sister is seven years older than me and most of the paranormal things she experienced were before I was born; so a lot of this is based off of her memory and our moms memory. I also have very weird dreams but mine come to me in an almost premonition kind of way, I've heard it described as "Déjà rêvé". I get them so vividly and regularly that it actually affects choices I make in real life. For example I once had a dream that my dad woke me up and asked if I wanted to go to Chick-fil-A, I said yes and while on our way I pointed at something out the window. He looked where I pointed and the next thing I knew we had crashed. I was sitting in the car barely conscious looking over at my dad who I could tell was no longer alive. As I felt myself starting to lose consciousness in the dream I was woken up. By my dad, asking me if I wanted to go get Chick-fil-A to which I swiftly said no. Now I know that had nothing to do with my sister, but I felt I had to share some of my own "spooky" dream experiences to show that I'm honestly used to it and almost desensitized to an extent. However something about this specific set of dreams she had never fails to send shivers down my spine and occasionally Ill even tear up while telling it.

For some context me and my sister are half siblings, same mom different dad. Now my grandpa on my dads side was a Vietnam vet who unfortunately decided to take his own life when my dad was in his early twenties. Neither me, my mom, or sister have met the man, we have only seen pictures of him. My Grandfather is Cajun French straight from the bayous of Louisiana and could also speak Cajun French. This is where things get really creepy. 

My sister only recently told me this story, but when she was younger before I was born she had a series of dreams about my grandpa a man she never met. She told me they were  like sleep paralysis dreams, where shed be stuck in bed and my grandpa would sit on side the bed and talk to her. The thing is though he would only speak in Cajun French so my sister could never understand him. She told me sometimes he would seem happy, sometimes sad, other times angry and would yell at her. Sometimes he was in normal clothes sometimes in uniform. These dreams went on for a while and were pretty regularly, and from what I gathered he seemed more sad/angry with every dream. Then finally one night she had a dream different from the others. This time she was stuck on the ceiling in a room unfamiliar to her. She then realized it was my grandmothers bedroom, and in the middle of the room sat my grandpa with his shotgun. I don't feel like I have to go into crazy detail about what happened next, but she saw it all. It was like she was forced to see everything. The next thing she remembered was waking up screaming for my mom who obviously ran in to comfort her. She told my mom the dream and she said my moms face went pale. She then told my sister to never tell my dad about that dream no matter what. When my sister asked why she couldn't my mom told her because my sister had that dream on the anniversary of my grandfathers death. After that my sister never dreamed about him again.
