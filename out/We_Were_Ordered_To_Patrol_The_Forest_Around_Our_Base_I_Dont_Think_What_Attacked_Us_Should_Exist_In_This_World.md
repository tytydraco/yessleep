**Corporal Ramirez reporting:**

I’ve been in the military for over five years now. Some of that time spent running patrols in dense forests, some in the battlefield fighting off enemies, and the rest… somewhere between chaos and pure luck. The battlefield has a rhythm—you learn it, or it kills you. I’ve learned. Some nights you survive because of skill, some nights because of dumb luck. Some nights… because of things you can’t explain.

At the time this happened, I was still a first-class private, under the command of Corporal Meyers. He was the one giving orders, keeping us alive, while I tried to keep my jokes alive. We patrolled, we survived, we did our jobs—until one midnight changed everything.



We had circled around a campfire near our base, resting after long weeks of duty. Jensen was roasting marshmallows, Volt perched on a high tree stump cleaning his sniper rifle, eyes scanning the shadows. Zuan leaned back against a log, smirking. Meyers kept glancing at his watch, quiet and patient. I nudged Jensen.

“You ever notice Holt and Volt? Might as well be brothers. Names too similar,” I joked.

Volt didn’t look up. “Genetics won’t save you from a bullet, Ramirez.”

Jensen snorted. “Or from Ramirez’s charm offensive.”

I grinned. “Exactly. I bring the charm, you bring the explosions, and Meyers brings the sanity.”

Zuan rolled his eyes. “You never change, Ramirez. One day, your mouth will get you killed.”

“Or maybe it’ll save me,” I said with a shrug.

Jensen laughed. “Yeah, like that time you tried to flirt with that enemy radio operator over comms?”

“Oh, that was tactical distraction. Totally professional,” I replied.

Volt smirked. “Professional is the last word I’d use for you.”

Meyers finally spoke. “All right, enough lounging. Time for patrol. Grab your rifles.”

“Already? But it’s midnight,” Jensen groaned. “Why do we always patrol when everyone else’s team is doing it less frequently?”

Meyers smirked. “Because you’re lucky enough to be in my team.”

We gathered our gear, leaving the fire, the marshmallows half-eaten. I took point with Zuan, Meyers and Jensen behind, Volt scanning from high ground. The forest swallowed the campfire light quickly; shadows stretched and swayed in the moonlight.



The forest was dense, dark, thick with fog creeping along the ground. Every step felt heavier, like the shadows themselves were watching. That’s when I heard it—a shift in the air, a subtle snap, something that didn’t belong.

Meyers shouted, “Ramirez! Jensen! Stay alert!”

Out of nowhere, a **dark, shadowy "force"**, the best I can describe it, burst from the treeline. I yelled, “MEYERS! BACK!” and swung my knife instinctively. The force slashed toward me and Zuan. I managed to block it just in time; Zuan wasn’t so lucky. The slash tore through his chest. He dropped to the ground, barely breathing. Jensen opened fire with his M-16; rounds tore through part of the shadowy figure, some bullets passing through, some tearing its body—blue liquid seeping from the wounds.

I threw a flashbang, and it retreated into the forest. “Not for long,” I muttered. Jensen and I then put Zuan on a military litter and followed Meyers while carrying the litter.



We regrouped and moved cautiously, stepping over fallen branches and puddles of mud. Distant screams echoed through the trees—high-pitched, frantic, almost human. “Another patrol team?” Jensen whispered, eyes wide. “Or… something else?”

Meyers didn’t answer immediately, scanning the shadows. “Keep moving. Maintain distance. Do not engage unless you have a clear shot.”

As we pushed deeper, the forest opened into a small clearing. Meyers radioed command, requesting reinforcements. The response was sharp, clipped. “The force is a fake monster, created by the enemy for fear tactics. Neutralize it. Troops en route.”

The force's return came moments later, when we had dived deeper into the forest. The force returned… **covered in blood** from its previous wounds, more grotesque, more mutated. It slashed toward Meyers and Jensen again. Meyers did a tactical roll, dodging the slash, then immediately and cutting one appendage off with his dagger. Jensen barely dodged the attack, but the slash tore his left bicep. I fired, but my rifle barely fazed it.

Then **reinforcements arrived**: one flamethrower unit and five shoulder-fired missile operators. One missile flew towards the force, exploding upon contact. It shrieked—an unholy sound, louder than anything we had ever heard. It fled, retreating again into the shadows.



After catching our breath, we found another, wider clearing. Meyers thought for a while. “We lure it here,” he said, pointing at the open space. I volunteered to act as bait, with Meyers and Jensen covering flanks. The flamethrower and missile units took position.

The full-scale attack on the force was brutal. The force charged. I taunted, moving through the open space, drawing its attention. Bullets, flames and missiles tore into it, pieces flying, blue liquid everywhere. The force shrieked, trying to locate its enemies. As the last missiles were expended, it **vanished into thin air**, leaving only a huge puddle of the strange blue substance and something blue that looks like a heart, at least one of something that shouldn't exist.

We finally exhaled. Injuries were counted, weapons checked, samples gathered from the liquid. Meyers commended the team quietly, the kind of praise that felt like respect more than words.



That night, I learned something about fear. Not the fear of dying—that’s routine. The fear of something *wrong* in this world, something tangible yet intangible, something that doesn’t follow the rules. We survived it. We reported it. And yet… I know it’s still out there. Somewhere. Waiting.

And I know that thing... wasn't the strongest of them.

**End of report.**
