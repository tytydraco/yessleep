Hello, I am Eric, and I was at a yard sale with one of my buddys jake. We were looking for anything of value. All we mostly saw were old retro games. Mostly mario, and sonic, and some legend of zelda! Nothing too interesting!

But then my friend Jake found this odd usb hard drive! It said, “Minecraft personalized”! Me and Jake were curious as to what the personalized part ment. so, we asked the old man at the yard sale what it was!

He said, “I don't know, but my son brian said that it was a MOD that he was working on, before he abandoned it”! Me and Jake knew that we hit the jackpot!

We decided to start documenting our findings. So, some of our posts will be half of the findings from my point of view, and the other half from Jake's point. So, where's what happened.

So, i plugged it into my custom and got a warning message saying, “potential malware are you sure you want to continue”! I clicked ok and I was immediately put into the game. There was no loading screen, no create world, no settings. Just the game and there it was constantly foggy i almost fell into a ravine!

But the more I searched I couldn't see any mobs, only items. And I'm pretty sure that they should have despawn by now! I was about to leave the game when I saw what appeared to be a castle in the distance.

I was walking up to the castle which was made of bedrock. and had a moat that I couldn't see the bottom of when I saw a sign that said, “Brian's castle”! After I read the sign when something hit my avatar causing me to fall into the moat. It Crashed my computer and the message said, “You're not brian”!

I then booted up my computer. But I was back in the game! I tried to get out of the game, but nothing worked!

I called Jake and asked, “would you like to play the Minecraft personalized now”? Jake said, “sure Eric, I do want to play some Minecraft personalized”!

And then my computer got an alert! It said do you want to turn on your WebCam! I clicked no, and it went back to minecraft but there was a sign that said, “you shouldn’t be here Eric”!

I am confused as to who wrote this, but it probably was the same guy who pushed me into the moat! So yeah, if anyone knows what is happening it be greatly appreciated! But until then i will let jake finish this post of with his findings!

Hello I am jake. and I was playing more of minecraft personalized when I thought it would be good to collect some wood. And after I collected enough, I went to go find the castle! And after a short hike out of the forest I saw

the castle.

It felt strange that there were no sound effects other than a droning insect that sounded almost like insects. But when I got to the castle, I built a staircase down with the wood from earlier! The more i built the deeper the moat seemed to get! And then I ran out of wood!

I was going back up the staircase only to find it was all gone! I was about to turn around, only to find that the rest of it except for the block I was standing on was gone! And since I was pretty much stuck, I then jumped in!

And got an error message saying, “leave me alone”! Before the PC then shut down! We tried booting it back up. But i couldn’t work so we are going to use another computer! We will update you guys again later.

Goodbye!
