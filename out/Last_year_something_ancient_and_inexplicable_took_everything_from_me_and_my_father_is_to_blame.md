*I posted a small part of this letter a couple of months ago but it was too painful for me to finish. It’s reposted here now, in full, with links to all the parts because the text is too long. I hope the difference is significant enough to allow that, but I understand if it’s taken down.*

Hi, Christopher.

This letter is long, and I know you won’t want to read it. But you have to. You’re in danger.

After May and I left home, I went to college, got a job as a counselor at an agency, and moved on. But not her. I loved her to death. I always will. But she wasn't cut out for it.

She made bad decisions, especially when it came to men. It wasn't her fault—we both know that Christopher, even if you choose to lie to yourself—but that didn’t make it any easier. Whenever things went wrong, and they always did, she would call me. And I would come running. No matter where I was, or what I was doing, I would go. Sometimes at great cost to both my emotional well-being and my professional life.

I’m not telling you this because I want pity. I made those choices. And I’ve learned now that not everybody can be saved, no matter how much love you pour into them, how much pain you endure trying to separate them from twisted parts of themselves that they never asked for—that they never deserved.

I’m telling you this so that you understand what came next.

I had just started the morning shift when she called.

‘Sammy,' she said immediately. 'I need help.’

Her voice was timid. Unsure. Like she only half-meant what she was saying.

‘Talk to me.’

‘Max isn't well.’

‘What’s wrong? Does he need a doctor?’

‘No, it’s not like that. He’s just acting weird. I thought maybe you could talk to him, you know, cos of what you do for your job.’

‘I’m a grief counselor. If you’re worried about his mental health, you should encourage him to speak to someone who specializes in that. Maybe a psychologist.’

‘He won’t. And I’m…’ she paused, then continued in a whisper, ‘I’m scared of what might happen.’

My chest tightened at the fear in her voice.

‘Scared? What do you mean scared? Has he hit you?’

I knew Max. He wasn’t a nice man—arrogant, slimy, a cheater. He’d tried to hit on me only a few months after he’d made things official with May. But I’d never got the vibe that he was violent. He seemed more like a gaslighter, an emotional manipulator.

The line was silent. I could only hear her breathing. ‘May?’

‘Please come.’

I wanted to argue; to tell her to leave. But we both know May would never do something like that on her own. That was too much like standing up for herself; not in her nature. Especially with men. I never blamed her for that. Abuse was all she knew. In her mind, that’s what men were, and that’s what women were expected to put up with. You and I both know where she got that from.

I couldn’t have convinced her to leave. Not without real help. I could have phoned the police, but if I knew May—and I did—she would just cover for Max, regardless of what he was doing. More learned behavior.

‘I’ll leave after my shift,’ I said.

‘Thank you, Sammy. I love you.’

She ended the call.

I almost died on that journey.

I’d made the drive to May’s before, but never that sudden. Usually, I’d leave London early, trying to give myself plenty of daylight. There was none of that now. I drove at a crawl along a single-lane road in the pitch black, too afraid to go any faster in case I ran the car into a ditch. There was nothing for miles except sheep and cows, and I doubted either of those would know how to fix a car.

I couldn’t stop thinking. Was I the reason May was always so helpless? I’d gone running to her repeatedly over the years. Every time something went wrong with another cruel bastard she’d invested in, I would stay with her, we would drink wine and talk and cry about the past, about that awful fucking house, and then I would leave. And she would be OK. For a short time.

And then, inevitably, she would find another bastard. I wondered if my constant babying was preventing her from growing on her own.

I was struggling to keep my eyes open when the radio cut out. One moment, some sweet, slow song was playing, then the next it was buried under a scream of static. That’s when the chanting began.

*fa-liv-fa-liv-fa-liv*

Only a murmur at first, barely audible, but it got louder. It was a disturbing sound. Almost aggressive. I flicked my eyes briefly to the stereo to turn it off, and when I looked back to the road, there was a woman there.

I slammed the brakes. The woman was hunched, pale, and very, very old. She held a large object that was dripping some thick black substance onto the road. The dark seemed to gather around her. I just stared for a while, anxiety twisting my guts into knots.

Then, abruptly, she screamed, and the car actually shook with it. I instinctively reached for the gearstick, ready to reverse the whole way home.

But then something slammed into the window beside my head. I turned to look and she was there, impossibly blue eyes glaring at me through the glass. She lifted her arm and I screamed. A severed dog’s head hung from her fist, black and mangled and unnaturally big. I didn’t get a chance to see much else, because she quickly drew back her fist and then smacked the awful thing into the window again.

The radio came back to life, then: that same chanting from before. **Fah-liv fah-liv fah-liv**. The woman joined in too, but she roared it instead, punctuating each syllable by driving the head into the window.

I hit the accelerator and the car lurched away, but somehow her body followed at the exact same speed. And still she slammed the head into the window; still she screamed those awful sounds at me. ***FAH-LIV FAH-LIV FAH-LIV FAH-LIV***. My heart beat so hard against my ribs that I thought it might break them.

And then, as if suddenly bored with the whole thing, she was gone. I glanced into the driver’s mirror but there was no sign of her on the road. All that remained was the thick blood sliding down my right-hand window.

It’s funny how we rationalize clearly exceptional events. I think it is a defense mechanism used by the brain; a way to stave off the definite insanity that would come with accepting that there are things out there more powerful than us. That we aren’t the apex predator. Have you ever felt like that, Christopher?

By the time I reached May’s house, I was calm. I decided that the woman was nothing more than an escaped patient from a mental hospital. Never mind that she apparently teleported from the road to my window. Never mind that she managed to keep up with a rapidly accelerating car. I made up some bullshit explanation so I could file everything away in my mental ‘nope’ folder and move on with my life.

It worked for a short time.

I stepped out of the car and hurried across the snow-covered lawn to May’s front door. I was still a little on edge, and even the trees of the north wood—my favorite part of the old farmhouse’s land—seemed to be creeping towards me in the dark. I rapped on the door. It swung open a few minutes later and light spilled out. May stood there. We grinned at each other and fell into a hug. All my anxiety melted away. My sister was a burden at times, yes, but she was my burden. And I loved her more than anything.

‘It’s so good to see you,’ I said.

‘Get in here.’

I took a step forward, then stopped. ‘Fuck, I left my phone in the car.’

May peered into the dark behind me, and for just the briefest of moments, some indefinable look came over her face. Then she looked back at me and waved a hand. ‘Just leave it for now. You know we don’t have WiFi. And you’re definitely not getting phone service out here.’

**\*\*\***

‘Where’s Max?’

May messed around with some blankets that had been draped over the couch. She hadn’t really looked at me since letting me in the house. ‘He’s out.’

‘At this time? May, stop fucking around with the blankets. They’re fine.’

‘Do you want some tea?’

I groaned and stood directly in front of her. ‘You asked me to come here. Why are you acting weird? Stop dodging the question.’

We didn’t usually bicker. I was confused.

She put the blankets down and sighed. ‘Honestly, I don’t know where he is. He’s been disappearing in the middle of the night for weeks and doesn’t come back until early.’

The answer seemed obvious. ‘He’s having an affair.’

She glared at me. ‘No.’

I was pissed off. I'd just driven for 10 hours and dealt with some deranged old bat with a thing for severed heads, all so I could come here and support May. Because she asked me to. Yet talking to her felt like a puzzle; like she didn’t want to tell me what was going on.

But that’s just what she’s like. Frantic one moment, evasive the next. And there's no point pressing her. She comes out of these things in her own time.

Did you ever experience that part of her, Christopher? I think she developed it afterward, but I’m not sure. Maybe as a result of what happened.

‘OK, sorry.’ I said. ‘Well if Max is out, and neither of us has to work tomorrow, why the fuck are you talking about tea? What wine you got?’

\*\*\*

Later that night was when things began to escalate.

May relaxed a lot more once I stopped questioning her about Max, and we both chatted as normal and worked our way through a couple bottles of Merlot.

After a while, I got up to go to the bathroom. May took the opportunity to refill our glasses and grab some snacks.

I climbed the creaky stairs of the farmhouse, looking around, refamiliarising myself with the space. The nearest bathroom was on the first floor, at the end of a narrow hallway. Looking around, it was obvious how hard May tried to make the old place welcoming. The carpet was soft, the wallpaper bright, and each of the small table lamps dotted around the place glowed warmly. Pretty photographs lined the walls: picturesque Scottish villages and dramatic Highland landscapes. Even some of May's own paintings were up. I smiled at that. She never thought they were good enough, but they were. Maybe she was gaining some confidence.

But despite all her efforts, I still didn't like being upstairs alone. The passages all seemed a little too long; a little too narrow. And the light never reached the corners, where the shadows collected and congealed like muck. Away at the end of the hall, a huge window sat behind a set of curtains, which were not fully closed. The inky night leaked through.

I wasn't far from the bathroom when I noticed May’s studio door was open. I had never been in before. She always kept it tightly closed. I think she was afraid of us judging her work the same way she judged herself.

I peered inside. There was a painting on an easel in the center of the room.

It was a large canvas, too big for the stand, and like nothing I had seen May create before. She usually did still life; flowers and fruit and stuff like that, but this was something entirely different. And disturbing.

The painting was of a forest: tall, gaunt trees surrounding a black loch. A hunched figure stood by the edge, gray stringy hair pouring over its face. Three dogs lay slumped in a bloody mess at its feet. They were headless.

I couldn’t take my eyes off the image. It had an aura to it, an essence, that felt almost magnetic. I know how this sounds, but at that moment it was like I was seeing the past and the future at the same time. I wasn’t in the farmhouse any longer. I was there, by the loch, with the freezing air and the stink of the dogs and that woman calling me.

Until a hand clamped down on my shoulder and I screamed.

I turned to see May glaring at me. She slammed the studio door shut.

‘It was open.’ I said.

‘No, it wasn't. I always shut it. Always.’

‘Yes, it was. Why would I lie about that? What is that painting anyway?’

‘None of your business.’

‘It’s grote-’

‘I don’t want to talk about it. Just go back downstairs.’

I took a step back, all interest in wine and conversation gone. ‘I actually think I’m going to go to bed.’

‘Ok,’ she said, her face unchanged. ‘If that’s what you want.’

I walked away from her, glancing back occasionally. She kept her eyes on me the whole time.

When I turned down the hallway leading to my bedroom, I stopped. It was only after I was out of sight that I heard the sound of her footsteps receding.

I didn’t know what to make of her reaction. I convinced myself she was upset about whatever was going on with Max and when I finally found out, it would all make sense. But that picture… I hated it. And it was the kind of thing May would hate too. I knew that. So why paint it?

And no, the similarities between the painting and my experience with the old woman on the road didn’t escape me. There was clearly something more going on. But at that point, I was still living in the 'real' world. My brain wasn’t yet prepared or willing to explore what that connection meant.

But soon, I wouldn’t have a choice.

\*\*\*

There was something in my bedroom.

I had just woken up. My eyes were heavy and itchy. I sat up in bed and gathered the covers around me to block out the cold. The temperature had plummeted since earlier in the evening. That wasn't strange on its own, but something felt off.

The old woman's face flashed in the inky blackness of the room and I sunk deeper into the pillows, the quilt pulled up to my eyes. I knew it was only a trick played by my sleep-deprived brain, but it’s hard to be rational when you’re alone in the dark.

Then I heard somebody breathing.

‘Who's there?’ I asked. My heart was pounding.

No reply. I slid the quilt down a little, half wanting to run from the room; half clinging to the childhood notion that hiding beneath the covers would protect me.

But protect me from what?

An old woman with manic eyes. A black dog, headless and bloody.

But that had been nothing more than an old lady off her meds. And besides, she was miles away. She couldn't have made it to May's house on her own.

Another breath. Then a scraping sound.

I sprang up and my feet hit the floor. In my mind, I saw horrifying visions of wrinkled arms slithering from beneath the bedframe and wrapping around my ankles. I remember noticing the room door was open, just before scrambling through it. I never leave the door open at night.

I escaped into the black hallway. The breathing and scraping sounds followed me, louder, right at my ear. I screamed and scrambled dangerously down the stairs, refusing to look back.

When I reached the bottom I spun towards the front door and stopped dead. Something stood in front of me. Some gaunt silhouette, black against the living room light.

‘Sammy?’ It said. ‘What’s going on?’

A table lamp flicked on, and my sister’s face illuminated. I stared at her.

‘Fuck, May, you scared the actual shit out of me.’

‘I scared the shit out of you? You were running screaming through my house at 3 in the morning!’

I laughed. Then she laughed, too. All my tension melted away. I thought I was just on edge from the whirlwind events of the past 24 hours and imagining things. It happened to everyone.

‘Why are you still up?’ I said.

‘I was just waiting for Max to come home.’

‘At this time? Where is he?’

She gave me a funny look. ‘Right behind you.’

And then I heard it again. That breathing.

What stood behind me was not Max. At least, not as I knew him. I wasn't even sure it was human anymore. It was the most disgusting thing I had ever seen.

It brought its hand to its sickly green, pockmarked face and scratched at it slowly, bits of skin flying off everywhere. *Scrapescrapescrape*. Then it grinned at me. ‘Hi, Sammy,’ it said. ‘So nice of you to come all this way.’

Even now, I see it clearly. That creature. I had never seen a sickness twist somebody the way Max had been twisted. I almost left right then, in the middle of the night.

But a part of me pitied him. He was an awful lowlife, an adulterer, but I honestly believe there is nobody on this earth who could see what I saw and not feel at least some sympathy.

And now that I could see him, I wasn’t afraid. I was sure he had been in my bedroom and had followed me downstairs, but it was impossible to take him seriously as a threat anymore. He was hunched, weak, and pathetic. It looked like a strong wind could knock him over.

At least, that’s what I told myself. But looking back now I know it was all lies. I just couldn’t leave May, which meant I needed to justify staying somehow.

So I went back to bed, barred the door with a chair under the handle, and told myself I’d convince her to leave in the morning.

It was the biggest mistake of my life.
