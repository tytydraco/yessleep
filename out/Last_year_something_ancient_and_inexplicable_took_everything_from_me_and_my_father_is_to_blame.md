\*\*\*

‘Aren't you going to eat your breakfast?’

A bowl of soggy cereal sat on the table. I pushed it away. ‘What is really going on here, May?’

‘I don't know what you mean.’

I groaned. ‘Stop that. You asked me to come here. You practically begged me. And here I am, hundreds of miles from home, risking my job. And you're playing dumb? What's the point?’

Then she got that look. The one she always got when we were kids. When she knew the bad things were about to happen.

‘I think we should leave.’ I said.

‘Max is ill. I can’t just leave him. He’s my husband.’

I wanted to punch her stupid husband.

‘Jesus, May, he looks like he’s about to die. We can drive to town and send an ambulance back to get him. I’m not suggesting we just leave him here to die.’

‘No,’ she said, with an authority in her voice I had never heard before.

‘Fine. We don't have to go. Yet. But can we at least go for a walk? I need to get outside, and by the looks of it you've not seen the sun in weeks.’

She smiled. ‘Sun in Scotland? That's ambitious. Let me grab my coat.’

\*\*\*

‘Not that way,’ she said.

I was heading for the north woods, our favorite place to go walking together.

‘You love that hike!’ I said.

‘No,’ she said, refusing to look at me. ‘I don't want to. Let's just take the path to the road.’

‘What’s the problem?’

She rounded on me, eyes wild, teeth clenched. Her whole face was like a bright red warning to shut the fuck up.

She actually reminded me a little of you, Christopher. I’d never seen her like that before.

‘Just fucking drop it, Sam. I swear to god. I don't want to go traipsing about for hours in a fucking freezing forest with you. We are taking the path or I am going home. OK?’

I just nodded, feeling nauseated and confused.

‘Also, you have to leave tonight. Straight after dinner. I’m sorry, but Max and I are going away tomorrow. On holiday. We have things to work out.’

That was out of the blue. She had never mentioned a holiday before. I wanted to ask what she meant but the tension was thick. So instead, we walked in silence, crunching footsteps and shallow breaths the only sounds. I felt like a void had opened up. Like the ground had cracked between us and the two parts were moving away in opposite directions. She wasn’t acting like herself.

'Sorry,' she said, eventually. 'I'm just scared. You know, like, I've always felt afraid. My whole life. All that stuff with dad and then with Brian, I've never really not worried. But it's actually different this time. It's somehow worse. Like, unbelievably worse.'

'Please tell me what's going on, May.'

She stopped walking and took a deep breath. Her face went through some kind of process at that moment. I couldn’t put my finger on it at the time, but now I think she was organizing things in her head. Detangling events so that she could tell me only what she felt comfortable with. I did realize later that she wasn't telling me the full story, but I was okay with it. Some things are too difficult to share.

'Max cheated on me with a schoolgirl.'

I stopped dead. 'What. The. Fuck.'

'I actually found out from the girl. I was walking through town and a bunch of them stopped me, all clearly younger than 18, by the way, and they said that Max doesn't like ‘dusty old cunts’. He prefers them fresh.' She shook her head. 'It's almost funny. Anyway, I didn't believe it at the time. Who would? Who wants to believe their husband is a sexual predator? But then one day he left home just 20 minutes before the local school got out. And I followed him.'

She looked me dead in the eye. 'I saw them, Sammy. Down an alley. They weren't doing anything but it's not like I stayed long enough to watch. I already knew the truth. There's no other explanation for him being there.'

An adulterer, a narcissist, and a fucking predator. I wanted to kill the bastard.

I waited for more, but she was done. I was confused. The news was devastating. Humiliating. But May looked petrified. There had to be something more than just the cheating going on.

But she wasn’t going to say any more.

'He's a bad person, May. I've always known it. Why won’t you just leave him?'

'He is my husband. He made a mistake. I can't go through another divorce, Sammy, I am 36. I’m not young anymore, and I definitely don't have the looks. What's the point in living if I don’t have a husband?'

Classic May. Marriage is the meaning of life. And I know exactly where that idea comes from. I can still hear those words, Christopher. They haunt me. What she heard repeated to her, day in, day out, in that fucking house; it destroyed her.

*'Find a husband as soon as you possibly can, girls. A man to please. You won’t be fertile for long, and a barren bitch is a useless bitch.'*

Truth is, the only constant in May’s whole life was abusive men, right from the moment she was old enough to understand what a man is. Her self-esteem wasn't just damaged; it was destroyed. Blown to bits and swept away—nothing left behind but that one conviction: you must be a good little wife, or you may as well die.

I don't know why we turned out so different; why she internalized that message while I railed against it. But if Max's unfaithfulness, his sexual deviance, wouldn’t snap her out of it, then I would just have to drag her out.

'We need to go to the police.' I said.

'Please don’t say that, Sammy. He's better now. That's what I was going to tell you. Something has changed.'

'Didn't look that way last night when his creepy ass was chasing me down the stairs.'

'That's not what happened. Just wait. I’ll make him come to dinner. You haven’t even spent any time with him. You'll see. Besides, the police won't do anything. He's not committed a crime because the girl is over 16.'

'I’m not sure about that, but fine. I’ll give him one chance. But if I’m not convinced, I’m dragging you out of this house myself. Kicking and screaming, if necessary.'

She nodded.

'But,' I said. 'Something isn’t adding up here. I get that he cheated on you, but the other day you were on about his mental health. And why does he look like a zombie?'

'Let's go back,' she said. 'It's getting cold.'

\*\*\*

'Hi, Sammy.'

The dining room smelled of roasting meat and spices, and May clattered around in the kitchen with dishes and cutlery. Max sat in a chair at the head of the table, barely visible, except when touched by the flickering light of the fireplace. I didn’t bother replying to him.

'Sit down,' he said. 'May’s making chicken.'

I sat as far away as possible. Even in the half-light, I could see the sickly green hue of his skin. I didn’t think he was contagious. After all, he’d been staying with May and she was fine, but I still didn’t want to be near him.

'What do you know of the Highlands, Samantha?'

'It’s Sam.'

He smiled again. 'What do you know of the Highlands, *Sam*?'

'Not a lot.'

‘A shame, but not surprising. A city girl like you would never understand. This place sings to me. I feel it in my bones. On my skin. Augmenting my body, making me powerful.’

I rolled my eyes. 'Whatever, Shakespeare. You’re not well.'

'I’ve never felt better, actually.'

'You have green skin and you’re talking nonsense.'

He snorted. 'You should go home, Sam.'

'I will. And I’ll take May, too.'

He shook his head. 'I know what your game is. You think you’re here to save her.’ He leaned forward, his voice lowering. ‘But you already had your chance to save her, didn’t you? All those years ago. She was just a little girl, and he was hurting her.”

I felt sick. How did he know? Had May told him? Was that what she thought too?

‘You should have done something, Sam,’ he continued. ‘Should have told the police. A teacher. But instead, you left. You ran off and abandoned her. And the saddest part is, even when you were there, you should have been the target. Not her. But you couldn’t even do that right.’

'You don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about.'

'You know it’s true. If you hadn’t been such an ugly—'

'Shut up.'

'—graceless—'

'I will genuinely punch you.'

'—manly—'

“Stop!”

'—wretch—'

I stood up.

'—then perhaps he would have taken you instead.'

I realized I was crying. On a rational level, I knew that what he said was unfair. I was a child. I never abused May. How could it be my fault? But there was still something buried in me, a guilt, a shame, that Max had wrenched up.

May flew into the room, hands red and soapy, eyes wide. 'What’s all the shouting about?'

I looked at her, and then back to Max. He watched me, a smirk on his face. I couldn’t look at him for another second. 'Nothing,' I said. 'I’m going for a smoke.'

\*\*\*

The yard was covered in snow. My cigarettes were in the car, parked by the southern treeline of the woods. I wasn’t allowed to bring them into the house.

There was a light in the trees. You know when you see something that is typically so innocuous, but it is presenting itself in a whole new way? You feel like you should recognize what you're looking at—like the answer is there but your brain hasn't quite caught up. That's what it felt like seeing those lights.

They were floating, but I couldn’t see anything holding them up. They looked like candle flames, but bigger, and instead of orange, they were golden. Three of them.

And I loved them.

I felt warm looking at them, and I knew I’d stumbled upon something special. Something completely new. Something the world had never seen before, but now they would because of me. I found them. They were mine.

I’m trying to accurately recount my emotions at the time. I still remember the experience clearly; one of the few things in this story I don’t need to think too hard about. And I know now, looking back, that my reaction was unusual. Floating lights in the forest at night? I should have walked away. Or recorded it. Or shouted May. Something other than what I did.

But instead, I walked towards them. They danced in the air like fireworks, leaving trails of light behind. And I could hear them too; a faint musical murmur. Beautiful. And cute! Like the sound of a baby animal.

'What are you?' I said. And they laughed. And it was pure joy. And I followed them, deeper into the woods, not caring that it was so dark, so late, so cold. These were my new friends, my loves, and I had to know where they were taking me. Would there be more there? I was praying for it.

We arrived at a small loch. The lights danced out over it, their golden dazzle reflecting on the surface of the water. I wanted to touch them. I was ready to swim for the opportunity. I took a step forward.

My foot squelched in something cold and slimy.

All at once, the lights dove into the water. Their brilliance disappeared as if a switch had been flicked, and then I couldn’t see a thing.

Reality came rushing back. What was I doing? I was alone, far from home, surrounded by trees and snow and water and the deep black of a remote Highlands night.

And whatever was beneath my feet.

I took a step back. As my shoe came away, so did some of the substance, and a foul stench, like spoiled meat and shit, came away with it. I almost gagged, but a whisper of crunching snow nearby put a terror in me so intense it shocked me into stillness.

I froze, the darkness gathering around me like a cloak. There was no sound but my own suppressed breathing. Then, as if they had been waiting for me to stop and pay attention, the lights burst back up out of the loch and the area was again awash in their glow.

But it wasn’t the same as before. In place of the warm golden color, there was now a sickly green. I immediately thought of Max, of his skin, and although I didn’t understand anything at that moment, faint connections were forming in my brain and panic was seizing at my chest. Instinctively I stepped back. My feet collided again with something soft and slimy, but this time I slipped, fell and landed at eye level with a sight that shredded the last few slivers of my composure.

Three black dogs. Bellies cut. Guts spilled. Eyes shriveled and sightless.

It took a few moments before I realized I was screaming. And then I noticed another sound, a new chorus, joining. The lights. I somehow knew it was them, like I had known before with their faint murmuring, but the sound now was something different. I don’t know if they were words or just guttural, awful sounds, but I can still hear them to this day.

*coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd*

Over and over, these strange sounds emanated from the green orbs spinning above the lake. Alongside the stink of the dogs and the threat of whatever thing whispered and rustled in the dark, I felt fear like I never had before.

And then I saw HER.

She stood naked, a tornado of snow swirling around her, patches of ice stuck to her skin. And her eyes, even bathed as they were in the green light of the flames, blazed blue from behind her matted fringe.

The lights changed their song.

*ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach*

It echoed through the whole forest. It must have been audible for miles. And it felt so dark, so WRONG. I couldn't stand it. At that moment I knew, more than I had ever known anything, that if I didn’t move, I would die.

I sprinted through the trees, but that demented fucking song never got any quieter. I could hear footsteps at my heels, unhurried, but constantly there, no matter how far I ran. I had the sense I was being toyed with. The chanting got louder.

*coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach KA LEE ACH KA LEE ACH KA LEE ACH*

As they reached the highest note, my head screaming with the agony of it, a howl ripped through the air. Reflexively, I looked behind me. My foot caught on something hard and I slammed into the ground.

I remember there was no pain, just cold. Nothing was broken, I know that now, but I still couldn’t move. I can’t be sure but I think she was behind that. Some kind of fucking spell or something. Which leads me to believe she could have paralyzed me at any moment, and letting me run at all was just her idea of a cruel joke.

The footsteps stopped behind my head.

'You shouldn’t have come here. I warned you.' Her voice burned like ice. And it echoed, though whether through the whole forest or just in my head, I don’t know.

I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t move. So I just held my breath, prayed to a God I didn’t believe in and waited to die.

'But,' she said. 'Your love for the woman runs deep. The man is mine; he was given willingly.'

Given?

'You can still save your sister if she is smart enough to accept. I will give you that chance. But be quick. You don't have long. And when I come to claim my *coo shee*, I will take everything left in that house.'

And that’s the last thing I remember from the forest.

May shook me awake. I was lying on the ground in front of her house, frozen.

'Where have you been?' she asked. 'Max is out looking for you.'

'I don’t know. Something is going on here.'

May frowned. But not in a confused way, or even a curious way. Just a worried one. 'We have to get inside. Come on.'

'No,' I said. 'We have to leave. Now.'

'Just come on. We can talk more once we’re warm. It’s freezing out here.'

She hooked an arm around mine and pulled me into the house. When I was warmed up, coffee in hand, May sat next to me on the couch and began to cry.

'I’m so sorry, Sammy.'

Reflexively, I leaned into her but stopped short after seeing the look on her face. I knew immediately what this moment was. She was opening up, unfolding for the first time since I arrived. And that’s when I realized that she hadn’t shown any surprise at all, not at anything I said. I told her this fantastical story about lights and dead dogs and an old woman caked in ice, and the whole time she had barely blinked.

'I don't know how to tell you this,' she said through sobs. 'Honestly, I wasn't going to tell you. But I saw them, too; the lights. I saw you follow them into the woods. I ran out, and I called after you, but you didn't hear me. It was like you were in a trance.'

I already had so many questions, but I sensed now was the time for listening. So I just nodded.

She went on, collecting herself a little. 'I honestly don't know what those lights were. I promise you that. And if I had ever thought you were in any danger, I wouldn't have asked you to come here. To the house. But whatever they were, I do know where they took you. I'm almost certain of it. I mean… who they took you to.'

My stomach clenched. 'You’ve seen her too.'

May nodded through fresh tears.

'I've never been so scared in my life, May. I could have died out there. I was alone, freezing, in the middle of the night, with some fucking… whatever the fuck it is, following me. And you’re telling me now that you’ve seen it before? And not only that, but you sent Max to find me? Max, who is the reason I am here, who is clearly clinically fucking insane, and who chased me around your house the other night? You sent him?'

She was fully crying now, her chest heaving. She wailed words at me but I could barely make them out. Seeing the pain she was in, the complete despair, softened me a little. I took her hand. 'Jesus. Alright. It’s okay, May. I’m sorry. I just want to know what’s going on.'

It took some time, but she calmed down. 'This whole thing is my fault.'

'No, it's not.'

She raised her eyes to me. 'It is. I made Max sick. I haven’t told you everything.'

I waited.

'After I found out Max was cheating, I went for a walk in the woods. Our walk. But I went further than I ever have, and I came to this Loch. The same place she took you. Please understand. I was distraught. Terrified. All my life, I've been with these men who hurt me, who end up hating me. I don't know what I am doing wrong, and I can't seem to fix it, no matter how good a wife I try to be.'

I couldn’t see how any of that was relevant. I opened my mouth, but she stopped me.

'I was going to throw myself into the water. I didn't know what would happen. If I would just float there, drown, get swept away somewhere. I didn't really care either. That's when I texted you; that weird text you freaked out about. I was in a bad place. But before I could do anything, she appeared. That woman.'

I thought back to a few weeks before. May had sent me a message. Something like: 'I love you and I’m sorry for everything'. I called her 16 times over the course of two hours before she picked up. I was already in my car on the way to Scotland. I had turned back home in a blind rage when she said everything was fine and I should just forget it.

May took a sip of her coffee, grimaced, and then went into the kitchen. She came back with two bottles of wine. No glasses.

'She actually sounded like you at first. Said it wasn't my fault. That it was the men who were at fault. Blah blah blah.' She took a big gulp. 'But then she told me she could fix Max. All I had to do was agree to it.'

'How could she fix him?'

'I thought the same. I told her to leave me alone to die. She said fine and stood back. Then I did it. I threw myself into the water.'

But nothing happened. When May was due to hit the icy surface, she instead found herself standing up, back in the same position as before. She tried again, but the same happened. And the whole time, the woman laughed at her.

'I asked her what was going on. She shrugged and said ‘the Lochs take only their own’. I don't know. She said I might ‘procure some rope and try a tree’ but by that point I was furious. I wanted to punch the smirk right off her face. But then she asked me again if I would accept her help. I don't know why I agreed this time. Maybe it was the fact something impossible had just happened to me, or maybe my mania had just taken over. But either way, I agreed. And she said fine, and to wait there, while she prepared the ritual.'

The woman came back moments later followed by three black dogs. They were like nothing May had ever seen; huge, snarling beasts with thick teeth jutting out from behind black, leathery lips. And their faces were grotesque, too. Eyes like dark tunnels.

'Before I continue, please know I already hate myself for this more than anybody else ever could. It might have been the woman influencing me, or because the dogs were so disturbing to look at… or maybe I'm just a shitty person. Either way, she handed me a knife and told me to cut the dogs’ throats. She said I had already seen her magic at work, and that she absolutely could 'fix' Max, but only if I did exactly what she said.'

May took another gulp of wine. And then another. 'I don't have an excuse for any of this. Not a good enough one, anyway. But I was desperate, alone, and afraid, and this woman had already demonstrated some power I couldn't understand. I thought she could really save me and Max. I truly did. And the dogs were horrible things. It made me cringe to look at them. I just couldn’t stop myself.'

I felt sick. 'You killed three animals. Three living things. That’s not you.'

She slammed the bottle on the table. 'Is it not? What the fuck do you know about me anyway? We live in different countries, Sam. And I am so fucking tired of being this pathetic little woman. Nobody has ever loved me, no matter how hard I try. Instead, they beat me and humiliate me. I am so fundamentally fucking broken. She offered me a way out, a way to keep my husband. To fix him. To make him LOVE me. So yes, I did it. I won’t die alone, Sam. I refuse.'

Everything she said, I had heard before. The lessons she learned in that house. It’s all her fault; never the men who hit her, degrade her or cheat on her. I felt the same old reassurances coming to my lips, but I held back. They never worked. 'Okay…' I put up my hands. 'Okay. Just tell me what happened next.'

She sighed. 'She made me drag the bodies into the loch. Then I was to wait until the blood had turned the water red. It was so strange. It was freezing outside, but the water actually started to get hot. I thought I was going to be boiled alive… She told me to say Max’s name over and over. I can remember now what she said, and I hate myself for not picking up on it at the time. It was maybe too late anyway.'

'What did she say?'

'‘Call his name and give him to me’.' She shrugged. 'And that’s what I did.'

Sam slumped in her chair. She lifted the bottle to her lips again but realized it was empty. She opened the second one.

I wanted to comfort her, but I knew there was nothing I could say. I had seen that woman myself, whatever she was. If May truly had given her permission to do something to Max, then what could we do about it? We didn’t even know what we were dealing with, let alone how to stop it.

'Is that when he started to change?' I said.

'Yes. A few days after it happened, he disappeared. That was the first night he went out. When he came back, he seemed happy, although there was something different about him. Like, not quite right. He said ‘the woman in the woods is going to make me strong’.' May spat out a laugh, which startled me. 'She was right, by the way. I did get him back. He’s not looked at that stupid little girl since. Now he only has plans for me.'

'What do you mean? What plans?'

She stared at the wine bottle. 'You have to go now. I shouldn’t have asked you to come at all. I was just so scared.'

She was closing up again. I started to panic. 'No, May, listen. Whatever happened here, it doesn’t matter. You can still get out.'

She was shaking her head.

'Look,' I said, 'that woman. She said Max can’t be saved, but you can. We can just walk out of here. It’s that easy. Just come with me.'

She gazed over at the window. I barely heard her next words. 'I don’t think I want to leave.'

'What?'

She looked at me. Her eyes were spilling over, but there was also something like relief on her face. 'I can’t do it anymore, Sammy. I couldn’t bear to be alone again. For all Max’s faults, I know that he loves me. He promised that we’ll be together forever.'

'That is fucking madness. Get your shit and come with me. I’m serious, now.'

She shook her head. 'You won’t ever get it.'

'What the fuck? How do I not get it?'

You will want to stop reading. Don’t. You’re almost at the end.

'Because,' she said, after downing the last of the wine. 'It wasn’t you, was it? He didn’t touch you every night. He didn’t creep into your bedroom at 2 am, shake you awake, and call you a slut, a whore, or tell you you deserved everything you got. You didn’t spend all those fucking nights praying that the house would burn down with him and you in it. You didn’t feel any of that, Sam. You just left.'

'May—'

'I know it’s not fair. I know he hurt you sometimes too. And I know that you feel guilty anyway, and you’ve spent all these years trying to make it up to me. Running down here every single time to clean up my messes. Risking your job. And I took full advantage of that, didn’t I? I used you and your guilt and some days I can’t even look at myself in the fucking mirror without screaming. And I know how wrong he was, Sammy. I do. I know that it’s okay to be alone and that it’s okay to be a woman without a man. But even though I know all that, I still feel utterly worthless without one. And I know Max is my last chance. So please just let me go with him. Live your life. Without me around to hold you back, you can make something of yourself. Be somebody. I really believe that.'

I was crying now too. 'Please stop. You know I can’t leave without you.'

'I won’t go.'

'Then we both die.'

She slapped me, her face twisted with rage and pain into something gruesome. I was scared. Not of her, not of what she might do to me or what she had already done; but of the looming possibility that I really had lost her forever. But then it all melted away, and she started to cry again.

'I am doing this for you, too,' she said. 'I want you to be free of me.'

'But I don’t want to be free of you. I want to help you.'

She got up from the couch.

'Where are you going?' I asked.

She smiled at me. 'To pack.'

\*\*\*

May and I got to the car 30 minutes later. The whole time I was looking over my shoulder, close to madness at the thought of Max returning. But we made it. And May looked better already. She walked with shoulders back, head up, like all those lies she’d been telling herself had been twisting her spine and now she was free of them.

For the first time since her call the other day, I also felt relaxed. And optimistic about the future. We would be okay, and this time I wasn’t going to let her run off with anyone else until I had thoroughly vetted them. I hated the thought of babying her but clearly, that’s what she needed. She almost fucking killed herself.

I got into the car and started the engine. The windows were frosted up, and I didn’t want to wait the time it would take for them to clear up from the heat, so I reached into the glovebox to grab the scraper.

May wasn’t getting into the car.

I realized immediately how stupid I’d been. All that stuff about her seeming more upright, more at peace with herself. It wasn’t because she’d let go of her demons. It was because she’d accepted them.

I scrambled out of the car and turned towards the house.

There were two figures by the open front door; black silhouettes against the hallway light. One male, hunched, diminished. The other was my sister. My beautiful, broken sister.

Her head turned to me one last time, and I sprinted towards her. But I was too far away. She took Max’s hand, and together they walked back through the door and locked it behind them.

\*\*\*

I don’t know how long I spent screaming at the house. I tried to call 999, but of course, there was no service. Then I spent an eternity with my head pressed into the cold rubber of the steering wheel, sobbing uncontrollably.

Finally, with nothing else to do, I drove away.

I returned two hours later with a police car. I told them May was in imminent danger. By that point, the front door was unlocked, but the house was empty. Nothing was disturbed or stolen: no sign of struggle at all. To the police, it looked like they had both simply up and left of their own accord. No crime committed. They weren’t happy with me at all.

After a few days, though, and with Max’s own family reporting that he hadn’t contacted them, the police opened a missing persons case. It never went anywhere. I gave them as much information as I could, but I had to withhold huge parts of the real story. They would have just thought me crazy.

In the end, though, I realized it didn’t matter. Case or no case. Wherever she was, she was beyond the reach of humanity. And now I have to live in a world where I not only know that there are demons like that woman out there but also where I know that my sister, my May, is in the clutches of one. And who knows what is happening to her right now? Who knows what pain she is feeling? What torture?

When I began writing this letter, I was just trying to get some closure. But as I approached the end, I had something like an epiphany.

Last week I packed up my car. Booked a hotel up north in Scotland. And I went on a hike.

It took me a while, but I found that loch again. And the woman too. She called me a fool for returning and explained that I had my chance to save May and I failed. I knew all of that though. That’s not why I was there.

I didn’t know how it worked. It was all a shot in the dark, to be honest. But what else did I have to lose?

I performed the ritual. I killed the dogs. I stepped into the bloody water.

And I gave her your name.

I know you probably don’t believe any of this, but I don’t care. You’ll find out soon enough. At the beginning of this letter, I told you you were in danger. And now, at the end, I have the pleasure of telling you it is all because of me. And there is no way out.

Nothing will make up for what you did to her, Christopher. To your own daughter.

But it’s a start, at least.

Sam.
