I didn’t used to believe in weird rituals or superstitions. But ever since I was young, I’ve had this one habit I couldn’t shake: I always wash my face twice in the shower.

Once to clean.
Once to return.

It sounds stupid when I say it out loud.
My cousin told me about it when we were kids.
She said, "When you wash your face and close your eyes, you slip a little. The second wash brings you back."

It was just a creepy bedtime story back then.
A weird little ritual we joked about whenever someone forgot.

But somehow, it stuck with me.
Even as I grew older and forgot most of the other things we used to believe, I kept that habit.
Two washes, every time.

It became muscle memory.
A mindless routine.
Something I never really questioned… until a few weeks ago.

I came home drunk that night.
Barely conscious.
I stumbled into the shower just to rinse the night off me.
Somewhere between the soap and the spinning walls, I forgot.
Only washed once.

I didn’t even realize it until the next evening.
I was brushing my teeth, getting ready for bed, when I noticed something in the mirror.

At first, it didn’t make sense—just a shape by the bathroom door.
A figure, barely lit by the hallway light.
I blinked.

A woman.

Pale. Soaking wet, her hair matted to her face and shoulders.
Her head tilted too far to one side, like she was trying to hear something.
Her mouth slightly open.
Her eyes... too wide. Unblinking.

I spun around, heart hammering in my chest.
Nothing.
The hallway was empty.

I looked back.
The mirror was empty too.

I told myself it was just the hangover lingering.
Sleep deprivation.
Stress.
Anything but what it felt like.

But over the next few days, it kept happening.

At work, the mirrored elevator doors showed her standing behind me.
Dripping water that wasn’t there.

On the bus, reflected in the window—sitting across from me, staring.
Gone the moment I looked directly.

In a café, her face distorted in the shine of a metal spoon.
Closer each time.

It wasn’t just mirrors anymore.
Any reflection—glass, metal, even water—she was there.
Waiting.

At first, she was always far.
A background figure.

Then she started appearing closer.
Within arm’s reach.

Once, in a fitting room, I caught her behind me so close I could feel a breath.
Cold. Damp.
Slow.

I started to dread looking into anything reflective.
Stopped shaving.
Stopped turning on lights at night.

No one else saw her.
Just me.

Last night, I broke.
I showered again.
Forced myself to do the ritual properly.
Wash once.
Wash twice.
One to clean.
One to return.

I scrubbed harder, desperate, trying to undo whatever I had let happen.
When I opened my eyes, the mirror was clear.
My reflection normal.
The room still.

I exhaled, laughing nervously.

It worked.
It had to work.

But when I turned to grab a towel, I froze.

In the farthest corner of the bathroom, standing half in shadow, was the woman.
Not in the mirror.
Not in a reflection.

She was there.

Real.

Her smile was wrong.
Too wide.
Skin stretched like wet paper, eyes glistening with something that wasn’t quite human.

And that's when I understood:

The night I forgot to wash twice…
I didn't just slip.
I didn’t come back alone.
