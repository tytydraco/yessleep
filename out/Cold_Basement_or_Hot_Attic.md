“…. a cold basement or a hot attic?” bellowed the plump real-estate agent. Bob was a last-minute arrangement, our original agent hospitalized with a mysterious illness.

I missed the first part of his statement; I was ruminating about how big a television I could fit on the opposing wall.

“What?” I asked, perplexed at the odd choice presented to me and my wife.

Judy touched me on my shoulder in such a way as to show her disapproval.

“I said, would you rather be trapped in a cold basement or a hot attic?”

“Neither” I answered, wishing I would have obeyed my wife’s nudging.

“Yeah, tough choice. I don’t know myself. Most folks are a little scared of basements. Say they’re creepier than attics, but attics are hot as hell and I’m a fat sum bitch. Not the predator I once was. I think… no I know I prefer a nice cool basement.”

“Can we see the rest of the house?” I asked.

“I think I’ve seen enough,” my wife interjected.

“Oh, folks don’t worry. You’re going to see the rest of the house, especially the basement or the attic, whichever you choose.” He started howling with laughter, throwing his head back in uncontrollable excitement.

My wife stomped over to the front door.

“Come on honey. I’m ready to go. This house is not for me.”

She twisted the doorknob and pulled.

“What the hell!!! Why is the door locked?” She felt around for the dead bolt, her nervous hand looking for a ready escape.

“It’s locked from the outside. The only way out is through the basement or the attic,” explained Bob.

“Alright man. Open that damn door!” I demanded.

“Hey, watch this.” Bob opened the basement door, went through and shut the door behind. The sound of his heavy footsteps diminished as he descended the stairs.

“I didn’t even want to see this house. Did you?” Judy asked. “I’m scared. This guy’s a freak.”

“He told me you had wanted to see this house,” I answered.

We stood in silence; both lost in overwhelming fear. The house was ancient and dilapidated, nothing akin to what my wife usually preferred. She was about modern, the next best thing, always looking toward the future, never reminiscing. The past was old-fashioned, restrictive, and dull. It was odd for her to even consider such a house, but maybe, I thought, she was trying to compromise, to at least entertain what I might want.

We looked at each other and started to move toward the kitchen when we heard him stomping down the stairs. He appeared from behind the wall with an axe in his hands.

“Ta-dah!! Magic!”

We ran toward the kitchen. I could hear him picking up his pace, and I loud thump as I imagined he jumped from the stairs to the landing.

“No way out through the kitchen!!”

Unfortunately, he was right. No windows nor door of any kind.

“Told you!” He was blocking the exit, axe in hand, with large, crimson eyes. His appearance was paler than before, like a snake about to shed its skin.

He lunged forward and swung the axe in my direction but tripped as the axe missed its mark and fell to the floor. We hurried past him as he convulsed on the floor. I noticed he wore no shoes. His feet were covered in dark, matted hair, the toes stiffening and growing longer. I heard bones cracking and flesh crawling. Bob writhed in pain but also laughed with glee. I pushed Judy through the doorway and as I stepped out into the hallway I felt a sharp thump across my calf. The axe bounced and rolled across the floor. It was a superficial cut but Bob was enamored with his aim.

“Got him. What a shot. I’m an old fat wolf. Got to use a little human ingenuity. Now I got a wounded rabbit in a trap.” He laughed and growled, and pounded his fist against the floor, seemingly glued in place, unable to commence his chase.

I grabbed the axe and hobbled after Judy, who had started to climb the stairs.

“Why are you going upstairs?”

“He said the only way out is through the attic or the basement, and I’m not going down there,” she yelled as she pointed toward the basement door.

“He’s lying Judy.”

“Well maybe there’s a window we can climb out of.” She turned abruptly and ran up the stairs.

“No, not the damn attic,” Bob yelled, his voice deeper and more sinister.

We rummaged through all the rooms upstairs. There was no way out. The only windows we found were not big enough to fit through. I ran back to the stairs ready to slide down the railing if I had to, but Bob was blocking our way. b

He was noticeably taller, his torso elongated, but the bulge of his belly unaffected. A beast both fat and slim. His arms were long and thin, but his legs were proportionally shorter. He looked fierce and yet comical. He was a tall man with extremely short legs. The back of his hands rested against the steps like an ape standing in the jungle. Although his face was hairy, it still resembled the real-estate agent that we first encountered.

“I’m an old wolf. I take a little bit more time than I used to.”

“Sort of like erectile disfunction,” I blurted out.

“Fuck you!  Boy, you should have seen me in my younger days. Oh yeah. I’d go from man to beast in a heartbeat and rip a motherfucker’s head off in no time. And I’m gonna do the same to you two. Laughing at me and shit!”

Judy tugged at my shirt and pulled me away. She pointed to a set of stairs leading up to the attic. I shook my head no, but she turned and darted up the stairs. I followed and stumbled across the threshold, dropping the axe to the floor. Judy slammed the door shut and locked it.

“Why did you come up here?”

“What, you wanted to go through him?” she asked. “You said that the attic had to be connected to the basement. There’s no way out up here. There’s only one room left to check.”

The walls were light pine bespattered with dried blood, some spots darker than others, indicating a long history of successful hunts, an extensive group of victims caught in the trap. The roof was high on one side of the room and slanted deeply to a low height on the other side. One could touch the rafters standing flat-footed. The same small windows that were in the other rooms were situated near the top of the ceiling on the high end of the roof. They allowed a precious amount of light into the attic.

We thoroughly searched the room, every nook and every damn cranny, but to no avail. We looked for hidden contraptions, levers, or buttons. Nothing. We were trapped.

“There has to be a way,” I reasoned.

Judy’s eyes grew wide. She whimpered and started backing away.  

I turned. The room had grown darker. The contrast between the darkness of the room and crimson eyes staring at us from a crack in the wall was stark, and chilling. A long hairy arm pushed open a panel in the wall. A monstrous werewolf pushed through the opening and crouched down to avoid the slanting roof. It reached up and pulled a lever in the rafters that slammed the panel shut tight. It lumbered toward us, limping as it made its way toward us. The beast’s face was illuminated by slanting ray of light. The face of a human was barely discernible. His eyes and cheeks were swollen. Blood sprayed from his mouth and nostrils with each labored breath. Two sharp canines protruded from his upper jaw. I noticed immediately the cause of his limp. One leg was much shorter than the other. Bob’s erectile dysfunction was worse than he thought.

“Nowhere to run to little bunnies. This is almost poetic. You have to watch me change into the beast that’s going to rip you apart.” He fell to the floor, arching his back in pain, his leg twisting and contorting to a new and final shape.

I knew that this was our only chance. I had to strike now while he was vulnerable, like a snake in the midst of swallowing its prey. I ran over and grabbed the axe and hurled it up over my head. I swung down as hard as I could into the monster’s neck. It shuddered and snapped at my ankles. I jumped back and proceeded to slam the axe into its side, hoping I was far enough away to avoid its bite. It grabbed my ankle and pulled me to the floor. It dragged me across the floor. Bob’s nose was now more of a snout, a disfigured face, a clump of hair flesh with sharp pointed teeth. He clamped down on my already wounded calf. The bite was intense and strong. When I moved, he bit down harder.

“Run Judy! Go, get out of here.”

I felt the axe slip away from my loose grip. This was the end. I would fight like hell to keep Judy alive. I’d wrestle the devil to keep him occupied. As I resigned myself to the struggle, I saw a glint of light reflected from the edge of the axe above me. The edge of the axe sunk deep into the face of the beast. Its bite grew weak, its grip loosened. I freed myself and struggled to my feet. I grabbed the axe from Judy and begin hacking. I hacked and hacked until I wore myself out, until I knew there was no way this thing was still alive, or at least, if it was alive, it was too crippled to do a damn thing.

Judy and I made our way to the spot in the wall where we saw it enter. I looked up and saw an obvious lever. Of course, now I see it. I reached up and pulled the lever. The panel on the wall popped open. We slowly made our way downstairs, Judy in front of me bearing some of my weight.

When we got to the bottom of the stairs, we didn’t encounter a dark, dank basement, but instead, we found a nice den with antique furniture and a big screen television, with a long ornate bar stocked with high end liquor and wine. There was plush blue carpet and shelves stocked full of collectible action figures, pristine and in their original packaging. On the other side was a door leading to the backyard.

I took a bottle of whiskey from the bar and limped out the door. Before I could lift the bottle to my mouth Judy snatched it away and took a full swig of whiskey. She turned and looked at me and smiled.

“I guess he was right. The basement was the way to go.”
