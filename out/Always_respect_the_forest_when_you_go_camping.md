The crunch made by snapping a thick tree branch is not entirely dissimilar to the crunch made by a human being’s neck when it’s broken.

Fun little factoid for you.

As I’m writing this, I’m huddled in my car on the side of the road in one of Oregon’s many huge forests. When we entered the woods, there were eight of us. Now, as far as I know, just me.

Let’s explain things, no? Considering that when the cops get here, I’m almost definitely going to prison.

Yesterday morning, me and seven of my friends piled into our cars and set out for a weekend camping trip. We arrived around noon to our campsite and began getting things set up for our stay.

The trek from the road to the site was not… pleasant. Jeremy, the outdoorsy guy in the group, decided that camping in an established site was too “beta” for him, and therefore us, so we needed to rough it somewhere off the grid. His brother Greg and girlfriend Loretta thought this was a great idea.

The rest of us were not as enthusiastic. My partner, Ivy, was very vocal about their complaints, something I tried to stay out of when Jeremy fired back. Like watching two cowboys dueling, but instead of six shooters it was emasculating comments and ignorant remarks.

“Y’know Jeremy, a real man knows when to listen to his friends. Just saying.”


“Yeah, well what would you know about-”

“Alright! Enough of that conversation, let’s keep moving, yeah?”

Adam popped in between the pair, hands up. A grin rested on his face, but the stress was clear in his eyes. His brothers, Luke and Peter, stood back, watching their older brother handle the situation with all the grace of a blind hippo.

Jeremy rolled his eyes. “Yeah, well, tell this bitch to stay in her lane.”

My voice joined six others in a chorus of “Their,” leading to another eye-roll from Jeremy, before he set off further into the woods.

Adam fell in step with Ivy and I, muttering under his breath about Jeremy, calling him all sorts of lovely names. The three of us grinned at each other before Adam fell off further back to walk with his brothers.

The woods were silent as we walked. That should’ve been our first red flag, looking back on things. It’s never fully silent in the forest. 

And yet, we thought nothing of it, moving on as if things were just as they should be.

We eventually made it to the site. A small circle, looking over a beautiful lake. The campsite was about 15 feet away from a huge cliff, easily a 250 foot fall into the icy water.

Jeremy looked over our grins and nods, smirking at us all. “See? What sort of campsite has a view like this?”

We all mumbled in frustrated agreement, which only led to him laughing. “Listen, when it comes to this sort of thing, I’m your guy. If you need… bible verses, go to the freaks,” Jeremy scowled at Adam and his brothers. “Or, maybe, if you need some freaky goth lullabye, go to Marcy.” 

Jeremy nodded at me, and I shook my head. No way was I gonna become a pawn in all his shit.

He shrugged and kept going on his weird little alpha male tangent, but I tuned him out as Ivy and I got our tent set up.

After a few hours, everyone was situated. We celebrated getting here in one piece with a lot of booze, as any good 20-something would do. The conflicts of the day were quickly forgotten once the tequila got broken out, and we were dancing to shitty music played from a bluetooth speaker while our campfire roared in the background. It was a good time.

Until the conservation officer showed up.

We heard the engine cutting through the trees long before we saw anyone, but we were so drunk we didn’t really seem to notice it getting closer until we saw the headlights peering through the undergrowth. The engine cut out, and we heard a soft grunt as a man dismounted from what we could now see was an ATV.

Pushing branches aside, I saw this mountain of a man peering down at us. Easily pushing seven feet tall, with rough, leathery skin and a bushy brown beard. He wore sunglasses that concealed his eyes, and the typical light brown uniform you’d see on a park ranger, complete with the wide brimmed hat. When he spoke, his voice was deep and resonant, yet soft at the same time.

“I think you all might have broken a few rules here in this here campsite, friends.”

Heads turned to look at the stranger, who grinned through his beard. “Yes, I do think-”

Jeremy piped up, walking over to the man with all the bravado of a drunk. “Listen, dude, we’re not hurting nobody, just having some fun.”

The officer looked down at Jeremy, shaking his head. “No, son, you’re hurting plenty. The animals of this here forest, by blasting your loud ass music all over. The forest itself, leaving garbage all over. Your fellow campers. And myself. I don’t take too kindly to folks behaving the way you’re behaving.”

Jeremy swayed a little on his feet, before pointing at the man. “Well, I think maybe YOU-”

The officer moved deceptively quick for a man of his size, grabbing Jeremy by the shoulder and tossing him aside, his head slamming into a tree trunk with a loud *crack.* The officer held up a finger in a “one moment” motion, before walking over to Jeremy, who was holding his head, his hand coming away sticky with blood.

The officer looked up at the trees, grabbing a thick tree limb with one hand and snapping it off the body of the tree, a loud *crunch* coming from the tree as he did. He looked down at Jeremy, who looked back up at him and finally seemed to realize what was happening, holding his hands up in defense.

“Hey, man, hey. Let’s just chill out and-”

The officer brought the limb down with such force on Jeremy’s outstretched hand that a bone jutted out from near his elbow, and he screamed, dropping his arms down to his chest. A choir of screams erupted from the campsite as the limb was brought down on his head once, before it was tossed aside.

The officer grabbed Jeremy by the shoulders and stood him up, blood running down between his eyes. He was alive, barely, but clearly in a bad state.

The officer wrapped an arm around his shoulders, looking at all of us. “You all are being damn near horrible to this here forest. And so, I’m gonna be damn near horrible to all you. Starting with this one here.”

With that, he slipped his arm around Jeremy’s neck and yanked hard to one side. A sickening *crunch* not dissimilar to the tree limb breaking could be heard, and Jeremy collapsed to the forest floor, the light of life rapidly leaving his eyes.

Most of us were too stunned to really react, save for Peter, one of Adam’s younger brothers. He let out a scream and rushed the officer, who reacted with a firm punch between Peter’s eyes, dropping the teen immediately. “Now, that’s no way to react…”

The officer walked past me, dragging Peter’s body behind him. He smelled of aftershave and sweat, and I realized this was my chance to get the fuck out of here. I grabbed Ivy’s arm and started slowly making my way back towards the woods.

The officer hoisted Peter up by his shirt collar, shaking his head as he stopped near the cliff drop. “Well! Down ya go, youngin’.”

As he threw Peter over the cliff, Adam rushed him as well, a tent peg in his hand. He let out a cry as he slammed the peg into the officer’s back, and he let out a grunt as he whirled around with a backhand that Adam was able to duck under, before running into the woods. 

The officer glared at us all as he watched us scatter into the woods, the evening sun framing him as he stood on the cliffside.

As we ran, Ivy stopped near his ATV, slamming their nail file into one of the tires. The blade snapped as they pulled it back out, but the hissing of air leaking revealed their strike was effective. We scattered into the trees, knowing this man was likely hot on our trails.

Alright, that’s about all I have in me to relive at the moment, emotionally. I’m going to try and get some sleep, hope a car comes by and picks me up soon. I’ll go more into depth about what happened next another time.
