Time had no meaning. There was nothing physical or tangible to hold onto as I drifted into an endless ocean of darkness. I never wanted to be an astronaut, yet there I was, suspended in the vacuum between life and death, slowly succumbing to the pull of a black hole. I wanted to fight the current, to claw my way free, but I couldn't. I had no body to command, no hands to reach. I wasn't human. I wasn't... anything.  

I couldn't remember who I was or why I was there, and that thought terrified me the most.  

The silence was oppressive, more than just an absence of sound—it was the absence of existence. It hummed with the weight of being forgotten. I realized I wasn't afraid of dying. I was afraid I already had, and no one had noticed. That couldn't be all there was. There had to be something after... didn't there? Or was that it? How long had I been there? Long enough to forget what light looked like. Long enough to feel like I had always been there. Maybe nothing had ever existed at all.  

Fragments of myself drifted through the void—my name, my face, my thoughts—but they crumbled as I reached for them, like sand slipping through a tide. Occasionally, there was a flash of thunder, a jagged streak of lightning, or glimpses of a world I once knew. It was like dangling halfway into an electrical socket, sparks igniting in the void, desperate for a connection. My name... did it start with an L? Or an S? Or neither? I couldn't remember.  

 A faint melody brushed against the edges of my awareness—the strum of a guitar. It was familiar but broken and warped, discordant in the emptiness. Each string snapped as I strained to hear, leaving me clutching at the echoes for something real. Just as I thought I could feel the warmth of her arms—her embrace—it vanished. I was cast back into the bitter cold.  

The void shifted. It became something alive, a vast entity whose presence I couldn't see but could feel. It pressed against me, an oppressive second skin. Every breath felt stolen, every thought borrowed. I didn't belong to myself anymore. I was a part of it.  

The creature laughed without sound, feeding on my despair as it consumed what was left of me. It devoured my existence, piece by piece, until I was hollow—a shattered soul.  

The rumbling of its hunger shook me apart. It opened its maw—an endless abyss—and chained me to its flesh. Tendrils coiled around me, pulsating with a rhythm that matched the fading beat of my consciousness. There was no fight left in me. Every attempt to resist only tightened its grip. I was an energy source now, drained dry like a withering vine.  
 
Each time its jaws opened, a thread of light slipped in—a fleeting lifeline. I tried to reach it and call out, but I couldn't. The beast snapped its jaws shut, snuffing the light before it could take hold. Its murmurs echoed around me, a chorus of disjointed voices speaking in an ancient, indecipherable tongue.  

Then, a deep mechanical hum cut through the whispers, shaking the void. Shadowy tendrils pierced through me, filling me with searing liquid fire. Flashes of the world I had lost flickered past in chaotic, fragmented bursts. Memories splintered, twisted, and reformed, a grotesque puzzle that refused to fit together.  

The beast's roar reverberated through the void, its hunger mirroring my agony. More fragile and frayed threads of light wove in, struggling to reach me. They shimmered like dying stars, their cries lost in the darkness. The light was swallowed one by one as the creature's jaws closed again.  

It groaned, exhausted but insatiable. Its tendrils tightened, binding me deeper into its being. The fire inside me flickered and died, leaving only emptiness. But the beast's hunger remained endless, and I was fresh fuel for its eternal feast.  

It went dormant for what felt like an eternity, allowing me to explore my new confines unnoticed. The beast's dark, winding caverns were terrifying, but there was nowhere else to go except deeper into its depths. The cords tethering me to the walls pulsed like veins, alive and suffocating. I couldn't see, but I could feel everything—the wet, throbbing tunnels twisting endlessly around me, offering no direction or escape.  

Amid the shadows, I noticed something strange. A faint glimmer—a thread of light so dim it could easily have been missed. But it stood out like a star in a moonless sky for me. I followed it, desperate for purpose, tracing its path as it dipped in and out of the fleshy walls, disappearing into the darkness before reappearing further ahead. The beast resisted my every step, tugging at my essence as if warning me away. But I pressed on, drawn to a forbidden branch—a rare, faintly illuminated pathway.  

 The air thickened as I moved, the walls closing in, but I kept going. At the end of the passage, I saw a shimmering barrier that rippled like liquid glass, reflecting a fractured version of myself. A child stared back at me, eyes wide with curiosity and wonder—a faint, fading echo of who I used to be. But the reflection shifted as I leaned closer, pressing against the surface. The child's face splintered, cracks spreading like spiderwebs until its features twisted into something unrecognizable.  

Its eyes hollowed into dark voids, its mouth stretching into a grotesque, silent scream. I didn't want to claim it but couldn't look away. It was reaching for me—or was I reaching for it? I couldn't tell anymore. The glass stretched between us, bending and warping like tar, pulling me in, deeper and deeper. The reflection melted, its form dissolving into a cold, suffocating mass that slithered over me, seeping into my core.  

I felt it fill me, its presence crawling under my skin—if I even had skin anymore. The deeper I pushed, the more the barrier shattered, each shard slicing away fragments of myself I still desperately clung to. Memories flared like dying embers, burning out before scattering into ash. As the last of the glass broke, there was no release, no gasp of triumph. I fell into the other side, fragmented and heavy, the last remaining pieces of myself now fused with the broken mirror. The child was gone, its wonder extinguished, replaced by a yawning emptiness.  

A laugh echoed in the distance, mocking and familiar. The area I stumbled into was unlike the beast's swirling caverns. It wasn’t dark, yet it wasn’t lit by any light I could understand. It glowed faintly, illuminated by her.  

She stood there, a presence I had forgotten long ago but recognized in an instant. I wonder if she’d been there all along, hidden in plain sight, waiting for me to find her—or perhaps waiting for me to remember.  

The walls glistened like polished chrome, curving and stretching upward into an endless void. Her figure emerged from the light—pristine and untouched as if she'd been photocopied flawlessly into that realm. She tilted her head, studying me like a painting hung askew. 

"My god, look at you," she muttered, her tone teetering between amusement and disappointment. "What a sight for sore eyes."  

"Halo?" The sound of my voice startled me; reversed—low-pitched and warped, like it was clawing its way up from the pits of hell.  

She narrowed her eyes, her expression curious rather than alarmed. "Huh. I wasn't expecting that. But at least you remember me. That's... more than I could've hoped for." Her arms crossed over her chest, her face unreadable.  

I tried clearing my throat as though it might untangle the distortion, but the result was worse—a strangled, inhuman sound that scraped at the edges of silence. "Wha—what..." I stammered, unsure if the words even left my mouth.  

Halo exhaled a sharp, disappointed sigh. She shook her head like a teacher scolding a slow student. "You had every opportunity to turn back," she said, her voice clipped and condescending. "This? This is what you chose. And you don't get to change the outcome now. You did this to yourself, so don't look at me like I'm the bad guy."  

Her tone grated against my fraying nerves, and anger flared somewhere deep inside me. "Why are you here?" I demanded, stepping closer.  

"Why are you here?” Halo repeated my question to me, her stance steady, her presence unshakable. “I've always been here—this is my domain. You were meant to stay inside the chambers of the Serpent," she said casually, folding her arms across her chest.  

"It's dark in there," I mumbled, glancing back at the path I came from. It was gone, swallowed up by her domain's stark, artificial enclosure. 

"Since when are you afraid of the dark?" She scoffed. 

"Since it became... sentient."  

"Hmm." Her smile widened. "Yeah, I guess that would be pretty scary. But not for me. Serpent's my friend, you know. I raised him from nothing. He was just a baby back then."

"What?"  

Her eyebrows furrowed, and then her face shifted as realization dawned. "Oh, that's right. You've been in the dark all this time." She sighed as if explaining something simple to a clueless child. "Ugh, just forget it. You’ll figure it out soon enough; if you don’t, that’s not my problem,” she chuckled darkly. 

Halo’s words swam through my strained mind, but nothing stuck. It all slipped through my fingers like water whenever I tried to grasp something solid. I glanced down at what used to be my hands—jagged edges of decaying flesh and static, flickering like broken signals on a screen. I tried to remember what they once held, but the memories were gone. 

Maybe I should’ve just stopped fighting and let her win. 

"You've got a choice, kid. One last chance to save yourself," she said, her voice thick with false sympathy. "You can return to the darkness of the Serpent, or you can stay with me," she continued, her tone softening into a dangerous coax. "I can repurpose you, mold you into something better. Stronger. Then, maybe you can finally make up for all your failures. So, what'll it be?"  

I remained silent. She wanted me to choose, to bind myself to one of her paths, but both would end in the same place. It was her domain. The Serpent was her creation. It didn’t matter which road I took—they both led back to her.  

I said nothing, and she grew impatient, her eyes burning into me with vicious intent. 

A thunderous crack split the silence, and the walls around me fractured into countless mirrors. They swarmed closer, gleaming with polished malice as she vanished into thin air. My grotesque reflection stared back from every angle, each version of me more warped and monstrous than the last. The hollow pits where my eyes should’ve been felt heavy, dragging my nonexistent gaze down, though no light or life remained. My mouth—whatever was left of it—gaped open, a jagged chasm stretching endlessly into my throat.  

My limbs twisted unnaturally, moving as though my body had been unraveled and crudely stitched back together. The mirrors began to shift and ripple, their distorted images reaching out independently of me. Some clawed at their decaying skin, peeling it away in strips as if desperate to escape themselves. The walls pressed closer, the sharp edges brushing against me, threatening to cut deeper. I tried to speak, but only a grating, inhuman screech escaped the abyss where my jaw used to be.  

In an instant, the mirrors shattered.  

A million shards of glass erupted toward me, endless daggers piercing my form with relentless precision. Each fragment tore through me, leaving fresh, gaping voids in its wake. The jagged pieces buried themselves in what remained of my being, shredding whatever fragments of identity I still clung to. I raised what was left of my hands to cover my face, shame flooding through me like poison.

The sound that came out of me was unrecognizable, a pitiful low whimper, like a dying animal's cry echoing on the side of an empty road. Halo's syrupy voice filled the air, dripping with satisfaction. "Oh, I just want to savor you forever," she purred as she moved behind me, prowling like a cat toying with its prey.

She lowered herself to the ground where I lay, wrapping her arms around me from behind, her embrace suffocating and intimate in all the wrong ways. A contented sigh slipped past her lips as she molded herself against my decayed form. "See? You belong here with me," she whispered. 

Her fingers traced the jagged remnants of my chest, gliding over the torn and fractured edges left by the shards. "Not a man, not even a memory. Just... nothing. So broken and so beautiful," she cooed, her voice like a venom-laced lullaby.

The void inside me swelled under her touch, an abyss that threatened to consume what little remained of me—every ounce of will, every fragile fragment of self, dissolved beneath her fingers. "You're perfect," she murmured, her lips brushing against the shattered plane of my shoulder. "I'll take such good care of you."

Disgust surged within me, but it was futile. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t even scream. Halo cradled me, suffocating me in her false affection until the weight of her presence became unbearable. She turned me onto my back, her predatory gaze locking onto mine, dissecting me with cold precision.

Her expression softened into something grotesquely tender as she straddled me, her fingers pressing into the hollow remnants of my chest. I let out a weak croak, my body trembling beneath her as she probed deeper, an invader planting roots in the ruins of my soul. Her touch wasn’t painful—it was worse. Empty, a violation so profound it stripped me of what little humanity I had left.

"Shhh," she whispered, her breath brushing against my ear. "It'll only hurt for a moment."

Another choked cry escaped my throat as she pulled her hand away, leaving behind a gaping absence. The pressure in my core vanished, replaced by the awful realization that something vital was gone. Stolen and replaced with her. 

"There you go," she said, smiling as she rose.

 Her hand extended toward me, and when I didn’t respond, she took mine, pulling me upright with ease. My legs faltered beneath me, and she steadied me, laughing softly at my weakness.

"That wouldn't have been so hard if you weren't so stubborn," she teased, her touch lingering as she caressed my arm. Her grip on my wrist was firm, unyielding as if I might slip away.

Excited, her eyes lit up, and she gasped as if struck by sudden inspiration. "Come on, I want to show you something!" she exclaimed, tugging at my arm like an eager child.

Behind her, a passageway opened, its edges rippling like liquid glass. Without waiting for my consent, she dragged me forward, her pace light and eager while I stumbled after her, caught in her relentless pull. 

We shifted back into the beast, down a winding corridor where veins pulsed, their colors moving across the walls like an iridescent oil slick. A distant growl vibrated through the cavern, an unsettling reminder of the entity stirring within. Halo released my hand and darted ahead, her fingers brushing against the walls as she glanced back at me with a grin, her eyes wide with childlike wonder. 

"Isn't it amazing? Wait, here comes the best part!" she said, her voice brimming with excitement.

Before I could answer, she grabbed my hand again and pulled me forward, her steps quick and eager. The corridor opened into a massive chamber, thick with smog that stung my throat and carried the acrid stench of decay and blood. The low thrum grew louder there, humming through my chest like the rhythmic breathing of a sleeping titan. Tendrils writhed across the floor, brushing against my feet, and I shuddered, forcing my focus solely on Halo. 

Behind her, something massive throbbed in the shadows, nearly hidden in the hazy gloom. Fear lurched in my chest as I finally took it in—a monstrous, beating heart towering over the chamber, its sheer size incomprehensible. 

As Halo approached, the heart began to glow faintly, illuminating the intricate network of veins that pulsed with life. She spun in the center of the vast space, her laughter echoing off the slippery walls. "This is where the magic happens! Can you feel it? Don't be afraid," she said, tugging me forward with a force that grew harder to resist. 

Don't be afraid? I was fucking terrified. My legs grew heavier with each step, but Halo didn’t let up, pulling me closer. "Oh, come now," she sighed, rolling her eyes in exasperation before shoving me forward until I stood mere feet from the monstrous organ.

I was sure she could feel my fear—it was palpable, and she reveled in it. With a delighted smirk, she stepped behind me, her body pressing against my back. Her fingers entwined with mine, guiding my trembling hands to the heart's heated surface. The flesh was warm and alive beneath my touch, pulsing erratically through my fingertips.

"Do you feel it?" Halo whispered, her voice low and intoxicating. "It wants you." 

Her words trapped me in a suffocating haze. I couldn’t move as tendrils slithered from the heart, winding around my wrists. I flinched, but her grip on me tightened, her arms wrapping around my waist as she pressed her head against my spine. 

The heart's pounding quickened, echoing the frantic rhythm of my own as more tendrils began to slink around my body, coiling tighter. Halo's embrace grew firmer, as though cradling me into submission. The warmth of the heart sunk into me, filling every hollow space and consuming me whole. 

I felt myself begin to change, my edges blurring as my form melded with the beast. My limbs lost their shape, my structure dissolving into something unrecognizable. Halo hummed contentedly as I sank deeper into the creature, becoming one with its pulsing, living mass.

"Oh," Halo murmured. "I knew you'd be good, but I didn't think you'd be so... intoxicating. It's almost too much. Oh, I need to let go," she muttered, breathless, her fingers trembling as she slowly released her hold on my waist.  

The organ also relinquished its grip on me, but not before leaving behind something new. My form was patched up and reconstructed, reshaped into something that almost resembled a person. I glanced down at my body—translucent patches of flesh glimmered faintly, veins of pulsating light threading through the surface like rivers of energy. 

I blinked once. The world smeared like wet paint, shapes shifting and dissolving as I struggled to open my eyes. Everything felt wrong—too heavy, too distant.

Then I looked down and my breath hitched. The monstrous, wretched form I’d just seen so vividly had disappeared. Relief crashed over me in a trembling gasp.

Halo is gone now, but her presence lingers at the edges of my mind—dark and inescapable. I don’t know if it was a dream or a waking nightmare, but I need someone to tell me that I’m not losing my mind. That I didn’t imagine it. Because I know what I saw. What I felt. She’s already taken more souls. Whatever she did to me, I won’t be the only one.
Please—tell me. Has anyone else ever visited the Serpent?
