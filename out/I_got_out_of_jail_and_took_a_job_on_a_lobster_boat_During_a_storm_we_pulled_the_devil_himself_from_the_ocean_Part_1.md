It's hard to get a job when you're just out of jail. It wasn't like I'd been in prison, and it wasn't a violent crime. I needed money to feed my habit so I'd taken to breaking into seasonal camps around Sebago Lake, scrounging for anything I could pawn for fifteen cents on the dollar.

It wasn't armed robbery but it was burglary and the state of Maine frowns upon that and so do prospective employers. You get a resume for Carrie James in your inbox, it's an automatic delete. Not that I had a resume.

They'd caught me red handed. Most of the places didn't have alarms or security cameras. But when the off season break-ins had reached epidemic proportions - and I'm not proud to say I played a role in that - a lot of people put in Nest cameras and shit I happened to stroll into one of those camps after midnight one evening in December and the camera in the living room had caught me, looking right at it. 

The local police and the owners shared it all over social media. "DO YOU KNOW THIS WOMAN? PLEASE CONTACT WINDHAM PD IF YOU RECOGNIZE HER." Lovely, right? Even with my puffiness and shitty skin from using, I guess someone still recognized me. 

My public defender urged me to plea and I did. I don't have much to say about the eight months I did, but at least I got clean and stayed that way, at least until the run out past Matinicus that I'm about to tell you about. And I’m only telling you about it so that you’ll understand a little bit about the things I’ve done and what I have to do.

Because it was on this run that we pulled something from the sea that revealed some things about me and about people in general that I’d just as soon forget.


-----------------

I could have done hard labor jobs, demo or something of that nature, which my PO encouraged me to sign on for. Idle hands being the devil's work and all that happy horseshit. But I'd have run back to the needle in short order if I had to listen to the job site banter of twenty-something men arguing about the Red Sox pitching staff or their armchair political takes fed by whatever the Facebook algorithm decided to put in front of them while they bided their time until the old lady went to bed and they could migrate to PornHub.

But  I ran into Billy Mac in the Old Port Tavern one night, soon after I was out early for being a good girl. I knew him from when we went to elementary school together out on Peaks Island where we'd grown up. But he'd gone to the voke in Portland for high school and my mother had moved us to SoPo. That's what we called South Portland, a mocking attempt to class something up that isn't classy, like pronouncing Target like it's French. Tar-jay.

He tried to take me home because he was drunk and didn't get the message that I fished off a different pier, if you'll pardon the applicable metaphor for this story. If I was going to be interested in a dude, it probably wouldn't be with the guy in Carharts and a Fox Racing hat who smelled like he'd dove headfirst into a vat of Fireball. 

But I didn't tell him that because it was good to see him. Seeing people from simpler times always makes things better, even if it's the narcotic we call nostalgia pumping into our veins. It softens the coarse parts we’d like to forget, blurring the edges of memory. It’s the most powerful image filter there is.

We got around to what I'd been up to and I was feeling loosened up from a few Allen’s Coffee Brandy’s with milk. (known variously as “Bitch Whiskey” “Fat Ass In a Glass” or “Lewiston Panty Droppers”) 

Drugs had always been my problem, and I could still handle my booze despite counselors advising heavily against that. So I spilled my guts to him before I spilled them in the bathroom stall shortly before close. I told him of my plight and he told me that his father had a spot open on his lobster boat, the Mother Machree, and I barely gave it half a thought before saying yes.

-----------------

The summer months were hardly like a job. I didn’t sleep much, but I never did anyway. The three of us would steam out of Portland Harbor in Big Mac’s (I know) 45-foot Osmond Beal at about a quarter to four in the morning, past Fort Gorges. As the sky lightened, we’d give a nod to the old World War II Battery Steele on Peaks where we played as kids. As we charged across Casco Bay, gulls trailed us waiting for us to break out the bait.

Summer lobstering is a close-to-shore proposition. Three, four miles at the most. As soon as we’d make open water once we cleared the sound between Peaks and Cushing Island, we’d start pulling our pots.

You don’t call them “traps,” not if you’re from Maine, anyway. You know what they look like. The cutesy things that you see on a dock on the cover of Down East Magazine, all wooden and weathered. Some towns and businesses stack them and make Christmas trees out of them, which is supposed to be  quaint, I guess. Other people throw a sheet of glass over them as a makeshift coffee table.

But wooden pots are a thing of the past. On the Machree we used metal ones with neon yellow grating, to make them easier to spot in the chop.

Also, full disclosure time: I don’t like lobster. In fact, I hate it. It’s the cockroach of the sea, a miracle of marketing, a social climber that would make an Instagram influencer blush. 

Don’t believe me? Fire up the Google machine. Indentured servants in the old Massachusetts Bay Colony rioted until the governor agreed they wouldn’t make them eat lobster more than three days a week.  During the Great Depression, families would have to sneak down to the water under the cover of darkness to check their traps, lest the town know they were so poor they would deign to eat the things.

During World War II, baked beans were 53 cents a pound and lobster was 11 cents a pound. Because one was, you know, tasty, and the other was a foraging bottom feeder. Think about it – would you eat lobster without butter? Or without it being slathered in mayonnaise on a roll? It’s something that is *improved* by mayo. Let that sink in. But somewhere in the fifties, it became a delicacy, because, reasons.

We’d find our blue colored buoys as the hangers – what we call low clouds, which is just fog – would start to burn off.  We’d attach the line to the hydraulic crank on the deck and begin hauling the pots up from the bottom, usually fifty to a hundred feet  deep this far out.

I’d wear rubber gloves, and me and Billy would set the pot up onto the rail, getting it up by hooking a curved gaffe stick into the grating. Then I’d pop the top of it open and start measuring whatever was inside. You use a metal tool to measure, from the eye socket to the start of the tail. For it to be a legal catch, it has to be between 3 and a quarter and five inches.

If it falls under three and a quarter, it’s called a short or a snapper, and you toss it back. If you pull out a female lobster with eggs on it, you put a notch in the right tail flipper and toss her back, so other lobsterman will know and don’t harvest it. 

Get eaten, or get to fucking, how’s that for a message? I’ll spare you any current human sociopolitical allegories, because you can probably do the mental heavy lifting on that front. 

If it’s a keeper, you use little pliers-like tool to band the claws. You don’t want to get clipped because they are grabby little fuckers, but it’s more for their own protection. It’s why you don’t keep your pots set for more than forty-eight hours. Any longer than that and lobsters are liable to get hungry. And if they get hungry and there’s nothing else to eat, they’ll eat each other. 

A boat needs about 150 pounds a day (at an average of a pound and a quarter per sea pigeon, you can do the math) just to cover gas and bait. Most days in the summer we’d get 500 pounds plus. Once we pulled all our lines, we’d rebait them and drop them on our way back in to port.

I’d take a foot long spear and jab it into the bait container that was filled with pig skins. That’s not a euphemism for footballs, either. Real, actual pigskin that Mac bought from various slaughterhouses around Southern Maine. 

You jab a few pieces of skin and stick it in a mesh bag and put that in the pot. Then you attach it to the line and dump it over the rail and watch it disappear into the sea. I liked to watch each one disappear, to see how long I could track the neon yellow before it was swallowed up by the darkness.

-----------------


The summer passed and I learned the job, easing into the rhythms of life on the boat. Got scars on my hands from claws and nicks from knives. The money was decent and we were back in port and sold off by two o’clock most days. I spent too much of my wages on shitty beer, but I wasn’t using. 

Mac got used to having me around and seemed to tolerate me, even though I was the first woman he’d ever had on crew. They treated me like one of the guys, which is a pretty low bar, but one I’ve learned is never a given. 

When the leaves turned and the winds shifted, stiff gales blowing down from Canada, life on the sea got harder. The lobsters headed for warmer water offshore and so did we. To the good, prices for lobster went up as demand grew scare. But the work was hard.

The temperature plummeted and the splash when the boat bounced over a cresting wave sent icy spray over us. Anything more than rubber gloves made handling lobsters and equipment a challenge. So my hands froze, becoming gnarled and cracked. I’d sneak some lotion on them when Billy and Mac weren’t looking, lest they bust my balls about being soft.

We had to travel twenty and thirty miles offshore, which wasn’t a day trip. We’d go out for 48 hours at a time and work non-stop. We’d take turns napping for an hour or so in the tiny v-berth in the fore of the hull that contained a padded mattress on a tiny platform.

The only good thing about winter lobstering is winter money. There was plenty of it. I could make $5,000 a trip, easy. That was enough to pay for my studio apartment for half the year. Eventually there might be enough for a two bedroom so I could get my mother out of the state run nursing home and get her a full-time home health aide for when I was out to sea.

So it was a no-brainer when Mac asked if I wanted to push East and get to the fair side of the storm and really make some cash.

-----------------

The nor’easter was already battering the eastern seaboard, shutting down the Carolinas and the DC area. And it was headed our way. It was forecast to cross over Long Island and Cape Cod, then barrel down on the south coast of Maine. From there, it would turn northwest toward the White Mountains of New Hampshire.

Portland would be hit, but the mid-coast and Down East would largely be spared. Prices always spiked when there was a corker of a storm. Less boats out meant less supply, meaning those with supply could charge more. I didn’t major in economics but that math is simple enough. I knew that from my drug buying days.

Mac gave me the deciding and only vote, a one-woman permanent UN Security Council member with veto power. He was a yes, and whatever Mac chose, Billy didn’t have a say in. And he was nothing if not a benevolent dictator. 

My only question was when were we leaving. The answer was that afternoon. The storm was scheduled to arrive the next morning so we needed to beat it. The chop was already getting heavy  and was only going to get worse.  

The plan was to cruise toward Matinicus, setting our pots along the way. Then we’d turn north at Penobscot Bay, and anchor overnight in the relatively safe waters between Vinalhaven Island and Camden. Then we’d wait, timing it so we’d head back to the west, pulling our lines as we went. 

It was about as risk free as it gets, or as risk-less as life on the water can be. Mac studied the charts, checked in with his weather guy, and deemed it a go. We’d be timing the market the same way a commodities trader might anticipate a hurricane crushing an offshore oil refinery.  

-----------------


We sailed out of Portland Harbor under a slate gray sky, making 18 knots past Ram Island Ledge Light. (say that five times fast) Twenty miles out, Billy and I started laying our lines.

Maybe it was the fact that I was so inexperienced but in the short time I’d been on the crew I had yet to develop that kinship that Billy and Mac had with the ocean. I’d spent my life on boats, ferrying back-and-forth from Peaks to Portland. But this was different. This was an open water.

Billy and Mac had a touch of that mystical relationship with the ocean, viewing it as a partner with a mystical entity. Hippie dippy shit, which contrasted strongly with their views on basically everything else.
There wasn’t talk of Davy Jones Locker and Mac didn’t have a topless mermaid on his keychain or anything like that. But there was this notion that always hung in the air, that we were at an uneasy, unspoken truce with the ocean and we needed to abide by what it told us.

So far, I hadn’t had a single occasion to consider the sea as an Entity.  But as we slugged for Penobscot Bay, I did feel an unease begin to wash over me as the swells crested the rails and washed over my boots, splashing up at my waterproof oilskin trousers. 

Maybe it was Billy that did it. He had some annoying ticks. I suppose we all do, and it was like working in an office with somebody. Though I’ve never actually worked in an office, I imagine that’s what it’s like. Eventually, you notice something – the way they chew their food, the way they sniff. And then you can’t notice anything else.

With Billy, it was the constant, absent-minded whistling. It was fucking aggravating. Mac would usually crank music as we worked, but when it was quiet, Billy would fill the silence. And whatever earworm he had that day, he would whistle the same song over and over and over. 

When it was particularly grating – like the time where he couldn’t stop whistling Smashmouth’s All Star I asked him to kindly shut the fuck up. He sheepishly told me he didn’t even realize he was doing it. I believed him. 

As a few flakes of wet snow began to pelt me in the face I heard Billy whistling a tune I had heard on one of Mac’s playlists. It was a “Going Home” tune, one he would blare as we made for port with a fresh load of bugs for the market. 

I didn’t know if it was an old seafaring song or an Irish drinking song but it’s called “Fiddler’s Green.”  (I Shazam’d it) And as he whistled, I didn’t find myself annoyed, so much as I haunted as I recalled one of the lines from the song.

"Now Fiddler's Green is a place I've heard tell
Where the fishermen go if they don't go to hell"

This unease stayed with me and I couldn’t shake it. And as the storm pushed further to the Northeast than was forecast and we tried to outrun it, I was slipping into a daze. And I nearly missed it.

But now, I’m sure that there was no way I would have missed it because something – the ocean, fate - who the fuck knows , really? Something decided that I wouldn’t miss it. And it was off the port side in pitch black ten foot seas, a howling wind, and squalls of snow.

I saw it – or more accurately, he, bob up out of a swell. He was wearing a yellow rain slicker. I screamed into the wheelhouse for Mac to bring it back around, so we could pull him out. Neither he nor Billy had seen it. Obviously, I wish I hadn’t done that, but hindsight is a cunning bitch like that, but not as cunning as fate is.

So Mac brought us around and we shone the spotlight into the water, me and Billy searching frantically. I finally saw him bob up again, and I plunged my gaffe stick toward him and the boy grabbed on. 

We pulled him out and that’s when I had a feeling of deep regret. Because why would you ever save something so evil? How could I know it at the time? I couldn’t have…but yet, that feeling that had been growing deep inside me was there. I knew. I fucking knew.

I need a break now, I need to sleep, which I hardly ever do. And before I rest so I can finish this story, I need to issue a warning. And I’m doing it now in case I don’t get to finish. In case I’m not here to end it, all nice and tidy with a bow.

Please, if you ever have that feeling of dread, listen to it. Because if you don’t you’ll do what I did, and you’ll end up saving the devil himself. Because he doesn’t stop and he cannot stop and it is you he is coming for and it is a debt that we all must pay.
