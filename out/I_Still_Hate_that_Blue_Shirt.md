“Bye, babe,” my husband kissed me on the lips, still holding my waist, as I inhaled his cologne through his blue shirt.



“Can you please pick up your daughter in the evening? I’d like to push out at least ten pages today,” I murmured against his lips, planting another kiss.



“My daughter?” he quipped playfully and left me to my empty document, silent house, and a stack of first-draft corrections.



With a huge mug of coffee settled beside the stack, I didn’t see the hours pass by. The house stayed unnervingly still, as if holding its breath.



The sunlight hit my eyes, sharp and sudden, and I discovered three things: I had slept at my laptop, I hadn’t eaten anything, and I hadn’t spoken to another human since morning.



Late afternoon. My daughter wasn’t home yet.



Panic gripped my heart, quick and cold, as I scrambled for my phone.



A hand landed on my shoulder.



I screamed and nearly fell off my chair. My husband stood there, smiling, clad in the same perfect blue shirt he’d left home in. 



Not a crease out of place.



I opened my mouth to speak, and he cut me off. “She’s fine. She’s in her room,” he assured me. His voice was calm. Too calm.

I nodded slightly. An unsettling feeling washed over me, slow and heavy. His smile was not right. His smile lines were stretched too thin, pulled farther than they should go. 



I shook it off and walked to the bathroom on the upper floor, telling myself I was tired.



Something felt off. I gripped my phone too tightly, leaving red marks in my palm. The screen felt slick with sweat.



I went back down after some time. My husband wasn’t in my writing office.



The house was quiet. Too quiet. The kind of quiet that presses against your ears.



My daughter usually attached herself to my side within 0.3 seconds of getting home from school. Was she even in her room?



I climbed two steps at a time and threw her door open.



The room was empty.



Her bag wasn’t thrown on the floor. Her skirt wasn’t hanging on the corner chair. 



The bed was untouched. The room looked exactly like how I’d left it that morning.



I swore to whatever gods were near me that I had seen my husband and heard his claim of bringing our daughter home.



Phone?



Where did I leave my phone?



I sprinted toward the bathroom, threw a glance inside, then jumped three steps at a time back to my writing desk. My phone was missing. My pulse thudded in my ears.



I turned around and found it on top of my bookshelf.



I hadn’t been anywhere near it since morning. The top shelf was too high.



Did I dream about my husband bringing our daughter home?



I checked the time. 3:34 PM.



I called my husband. The ringer went through fully. Each ring felt longer than the last. He didn’t pick up.



Where was he?



I checked room by room, the kitchen, the living room, his office, and our bedroom.



Everything was the same as I’d left it that morning, and yet everything felt disturbed, like someone had moved through it without leaving a trace.



I whirled around at the sensation of being watched and saw my husband coming out of our bathroom.



I had just been there. I knew I had. He was definitely not there.



He smiled at me and turned toward our bedroom, unhurried. I dragged my leaden legs and forced myself to follow him, my feet refusing to move any faster.



A jarring ringtone tore through the silence.



I jumped as I saw the caller ID.



My husband.



The screen glowed in my hand. He had just passed me. My skin prickled as I answered.



Silence. Then his voice filled the air from my phone. “Babe, I’m almost reaching home. Do you want anything for me to grab from the store?”



A sweet giggle followed, light and careless. My daughter’s.



The hallway tilted.



I don’t remember much after that. I heard something clatter to the floor, and my mind went dark.



I came back to myself in the arms of my neighbor. Hands gripping me. Voices shouting somewhere far away.



The night sky twinkled above. A small, warm form was curled into my lap. My sweet baby. Breathing. Alive.



His blue shirt came into view. It was crumpled now, wrinkled, wrong in a different way.



I lifted my eyes to meet his. Worry filled his face, real worry. He crouched down, his smile tired and shaken, nothing forced about it.



This man was my husband.



Not whatever I had seen that afternoon in our home.



Words stumbled and poured out of me as his hands held mine tightly, grounding, familiar. My body gave out, viscerally, and I broke into heaving sobs. I didn’t know if he understood that something else had stood in his place inside our home. I couldn’t make myself say it aloud.



Whatever came that afternoon, I don’t know whether it was the product of my exhausted mind or something else entirely. It was enough to push my family to a new place.



I still hate that blue shirt.
