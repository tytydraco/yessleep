The Captain is dead.

  
When we first started today, the seven of us were thoroughly creeped out. Terrified of what might lie in wait for us as we awoke in our cabins. Me especially, after hearing the music, voices and screaming filtering in from down the hall, in the very lounge we’d slept in for the last two nights. But. I never imagined that when the day would end, there would be two less of us. *Three*, technically.

  
As hard as it may be to concentrate on anything but that horrible fact, I’ll try and get to what you guys have said and commented. To say I appreciate everything you’ve suggested, to say *all* of us are thankful would be a massive understatement. I feel like you guys are what’s helping me cling to the last vestiges of sanity remaining in my mind. To the people who have commented about making it to either the engine room or the bridge to try and stop, sabotage or even change the course of the ship, that was the *very* idea that the Captain came to us with when we gathered. But, as I’ll explain in a minute…it seems the…I don’t know what to call them. Ghosts, entities, evil spirits; hell, *demons* for all I know, anticipated the move on our parts.  


Salt was one of the few ingredients we *didn’t* seem to find in the *Verandah Grill*, though from what the map of the ship shows, there are numerous more restaurants on board. So we’re going to keep our eyes open for it. I just hope you’ll be right about these things being unable to cross it. To the person who mentioned the Morse code transmitter, I’d forgotten to mention last night, that it had been torn out along with the radio microphone. These things very much do not want us trying to call for help. We’re most definitely *not* splitting up anymore, either. Knowing what we do now, it’s just too dangerous, even if it means more slower going.  


But…I should get on and tell what happened.  


The four of us were woken up by several rapid *bangs* on our cabin door. After seeing the programme which had been shoved under the door last night, I was only able to catch small spurts of sleep. Ones that were all interlaced with horrendous nightmares of dozens, hundreds…*thousands* of the specters outside pressing up against our cabin. Asking us to open the door and inviting us to the party down the hall, before bursting into laughter and screams. So when the knocking began, I shot up from where I’d been curled up on the room’s loveseat, my clouded, half asleep mind filling with panic and terror. *They’re here! They’re here for us!*  


However, the voice on the other side of the door filled us with a momentary sense of calm. It was the Captain’s voice. But, remembering what had happened with the walkie-talkie yesterday, Wyatt shushed us and crept to the door, putting his eye against the peephole. He stood there for a moment, then pulled away, a look of relief in his eyes. “It really is him” he breathed out before unlocking the door. Instantly the Captain strode in, followed close behind by Vinny. For a moment the relief returned. Until I realized that they were alone. He answered my unasked question before I was able to open my mouth.  


“Will’s gone” He put a hand over his face, taking a deep breath before continuing. “I don’t know how he managed to slip out without waking me. But when Vinny woke up a few minutes ago to use the bathroom, he found our cabin door unlocked and standing open. There’s no sign of him anywhere” The man’s words hung in the tension and dread filled air. Every single one of us knew exactly where he’d gone. *He’s gone off to find that woman again. Diana*. Finally, the silence was broken by Andrew. “So…what do we do?” A pained look crossed the Captain’s face. “I…I’m honestly torn, boys. Part of me thinks we should immediately try finding him. If it’s...not already too late. But another part thinks we should try and find any way to either stop the ship, or sabotage the engines”  


He looked over at me. “Nate, have you checked the computer to see what those people have said?” I shook my head and began to turn to boot up the laptop, when I caught sight of the programme lying on the floor. I knew if I showed it to them, the already palpable fear infecting our group would grow. But at this point, hiding anything might end up being a fatal mistake. *They need to see it*. I cleared my throat. “Um…sir, before I do that, there’s something you all need to see” I picked up the programme and handed it to the Captain. Everyone crowded around as he flipped it open. I saw the men’s faces turn pale as they read the notice inside, saw their own names written there. Andrew let out a shaky breath. “Oh-kay…I think I’m starting to turn into a believer of the whole ghost ship idea” he said quietly.  


After that, we quickly broke out the laptop and checked your comments. After reading them for a few moments, Wyatt pointed, smiling slightly. “Cap, looks like they have the same idea you do. About either taking control of the ship, or straight up sabotaging the engines” The Captain stared for another second at the screen before nodding. “Then that settles it. We head first back for the bridge, and if that doesn’t work, the engine room” He gazed seriously around at all of us. “From now on, we don’t split up from each other at all. It’ll mean things will be done slower, but, in my personal opinion, it just might be safer” He shot a glance back at the open door to our cabin.  


“Especially with Will being who-knows-where onboard”  


Putting away the laptop, I quickly took a moment to set the solar charger on the lip of the porthole to gather a charge; the laptop’s battery had gotten precariously low, and the six of us moved out in the hall, closing the door behind us. We now carried three fire axes we’d taken from red emergency boxes scattered around the ship. My head swung on a swivel as we passed each t-junction, half expecting something…or, now *someone* to lunge at us from around a corner. The silence, only broken by the low throbbing sound of the ship’s engines rising from far below us didn’t help the tense atmosphere that had fallen over us. I didn’t know if I was more afraid of running into the ship’s inhabitants again, or our own colleague.   


When we reached the doors to the lounge, however, all thoughts evaporated in my head as we froze, staring into the room. It still looked the same as it had yesterday, with two large exceptions. The first is that the raised section of floor near the back of the room where a band would play, one that was desolate and empty when we’d arrived, no longer was. Even from across the room, I saw instruments set up on it. Violins, trumpets, bass’, a drum set and more were set up as though they’d just been put down by a band. Realization flashed through my mind. *The music I heard last night. It wasn’t a hallucination. It was real*. The second noticeable change in the room was the clear after remnants of a party. Confetti and balloons which had lost the helium needed to keep them afloat littered the dance floor, and on a few tables we could see half-empty wine and cocktail glasses.  


“They had themselves one hell of a shindig last night” Vinny said softly. I shot a glance at him. The look on his face mirrored the emotions I felt. In any other situation, the scene would’ve been one to feel happy about; people celebrating something. Here and now, though, it evoked the sort of dread and fear that one would get stepping into a haunted house. The Captain shook his head slowly, then gestured to us. “Come on, let’s keep moving” And moving quickly, we crossed the lounge, kicking balloons out of our way before heading to the bridge.  


“What the *hell*?!” Spencer exclaimed as we stood in front of the hatch which led to the bridge area of the ship. Which yesterday had stood wide open, held in place by the metal hook which had been set into an eye swivel on the wall. But now, as we stared in disbelief, it had been tightly shut. Not just shut, but locked; try as hard as we might, to the point our hands turned red and stung from exertion, the handle refused to spin. “You’ve gotta be *fucking* kidding me” Andrew muttered as the Captain began patting at his pockets. His head snapped up, his eyes wide as he realized something. “The keys are gone” he said, before shaking his head. “Will must’ve lifted ‘em from me before he snuck out” The realization that we’d been effectively blocked from reaching the helm caused the hopeless feeling we’d had yesterday, seeing the ship moving to return. I let out a sigh and put my back to the hatch, resting my head on the cool metal.  


After a minute, we slowly made our way down to the bowels of the ship. I already knew full well what we’d find, but we still followed the increasingly hunched shoulders of the Captain as we followed him down narrow grated steps, flicking on our flashlights as the incandescent bulbs over our heads became fewer and farther between. When we reached the hold and rounded the final corner, I saw what I expected. The metal hatch, above which the words *Engine and Boiler Rooms* were stamped, was closed. Wyatt suddenly burst into a sprint, pushing past the Captain to the door, where he frantically, almost hysterically began yanking on the handle. It was as if he hoped he’d be able to wrench it open by sheer will. But it remained steadfast. Finally, he stopped and began kicking the door. “Fuck you, you stupid piece of shit *ship*!” he screamed, his voice bouncing off the grated floor and pipes, echoing away into the gloom. “And fuck all of you long-dead, ancient, last century ass ghosts!” He collapsed to the floor, beginning to cry softly.  


I couldn’t do anything but watch, stunned by the man’s apparent mental break. Andrew, the Captain and Spencer moved to comfort him, leaving me and Vinny standing in the hallway. I shot a look to my left, seeing another closed and likely locked hatch. The sign above this door declared it the *Auxilary Machine Room*. Sighing, I placed my head in my hands. *They knew we would try this. They knew, and they got ahead to cut us off. Likely with Will’s help*. I was just trying to calm myself when the sound, one that was almost so quiet I missed it reached my ears.  


“*Nathan*”  


I froze in place, a massive shiver racing up my spine at the call. It was replaced by a steady stream of chills as my eyes widened behind my fingers. For a moment I waited, barely breathing as I strained my ears to hear. My heart was doing the Macarena inside my chest. All I could hear was the soft hissing of the pipes that ran alongside us and over our heads in the ceiling, along with the soft voices of the men ahead of me. I forced myself to let out a deep breath, trying to relax. *You’re hearing things, buddy. It’s just the pipes, nothing more. They’re not down here with you*. I was just beginning to believe it, when it came again. And this time, it was unmistakable.  


“*Oh, Nathan*”  


It was the man’s voice I’d heard on the radio on the second day aboard. The one I’d heard through the radio. It called out to me in a mocking, sing-song manner, and without seeing anything, I knew the owner of the voice was smiling. And not a pleasant smile, either. I slowly stood up straight, pulling my hands away from my eyes as my breath became ragged and shallow. And then, just when I thought it was impossible to feel any more frightened, the feeling of being watched came again. Now from directly off to my right. Another chill shot through me as I realized where I was standing. I was standing almost directly in the middle of a t-junction. *Ohh…shit*. Swallowing hard, I slowly turned, aiming my flashlight with a shaking hand down the hallway.  


I almost screamed.  


The shadowy figures were back. They stood at the end of the hallway, underneath a sign labeled *Water Softener and Air Conditioning Plant*. I couldn’t tell how many there were, but they packed the hall from one side to the other, standing just out of reach of my flashlight’s beam. Horror and dread filled every crevice of my body, and I felt myself begin to shake. I attempted to speak, but my voice seemed to catch in my throat. And then they took a step forward. The horror I felt increased as I saw the overhead lamp wink out, plunging the next section into darkness. I found my voice, struggling to pass the single word over my lips. “F-f-f-f-*Fuck*…”  


Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Vinny turn and look at me. The slight curiosity on his face immediately melted as he caught sight of the expression I wore. “Nate, what the hell’s wrong?” he asked. Faintly, I heard the others stop talking, as well as them slowly begin to make their way back to me. I kept trying to force more words out. *I have to warn them!* My mind screamed at me. But it was as though I’d lost my grasp of the English language. I felt Vinny step next to me and saw his flashlight aim down the corridor. And then I felt him go stiff as a board as he caught sight of what I’d seen. “Oh, *shit*” he breathed. Then, a little louder: “Um…guys?” By now the rest of our group had reached us, and everyone collectively aimed their lights down the hall.  


I heard Wyatt suddenly begin to hyperventilate as the figures took another step forward. Another overhead light went out. “*…Jesus…*” the Captain whispered. Spencer said nothing, but I knew he had to be scared shitless, finally face to face with what he’d denied about until now. As a third light went out, I finally found my voice again. “Gabe?” I felt the Captain put a hand on my shoulder. “What is it, Nate?” I swallowed hard, then spoke the words I knew in the marrow of my bones to be true.  


“I-I think it’s time to start running now”  


The next moment, all of us were turning and sprinting back the way we’d come. Behind us, I more felt than heard our pursuers give chase. And I heard a noise that chilled me to the bone. The sound of the overhead lights just behind us, not just clicking off, but shattering in their housings. The metal halls rang out with our screams and shouts as we urged each other to move faster, reaching the stairs and beginning to climb. “Move your asses, everyone!” the Captain shouted as he dragged Wyatt off the top of the stairs. As we climbed, my eyes flashed to the metal signs indicating what deck we were on. We passed G-Deck, then F-Deck, making our way up. As we reached the top of the landing, I spared a look down. And this time, I *did* scream.  


The figures were *swirling* up after us. Some didn’t even touch the floor, flying through the air in pursuit. I heard the whispers, laughter and screaming I’d heard when I’d been cornered by the gym. This time, however, the voices somehow held even more malevolence than they had originally. *They’re angry. They’re downright pissed that we just tried to sabotage the ship*. I raced to keep up with the group. We’d just reached E-Deck when a loud, clanging sound came from above us. I reached the bottom of the next set of stairs where the others had gathered and looked up. And I almost screamed again. More shadowy figures were swirling down from above towards us. We were trapped in a pincer movement, with no way to escape. For a moment, the existential dread I’d felt facing the rogue wave that night came again, and I felt sure this was the end of us all. Until Spencer let out a cry.  


“Look, there!”  


Spinning around, I saw a closed hatch standing a few feet away from us. The sign above it read *Cargo/Motor-Car Hold*. I was the closest to it and leapt for it, my hands locking around the handle and praying that it wouldn’t be locked. To my relief, though, the handle spun and the hatch swung open. “Come on!” I yelled, moving out of the way to let the others in. As soon as the Captain dragged Wyatt through, I slammed the hatch closed as I heard the man’s voice ring out again. “*You’re only delaying the inevitable, gentlemen!*” I felt someone slam into the hatch next to me, turning to see Vinny begin locking the hatch. Reaching up, I did the same on my side. Not a moment too soon, either. As soon as the last lock had been flipped into place, something slammed into the hatch with the force of a speeding freight train.  


The two of us leapt back as the banging continued for a few seconds. Then, abruptly, it stopped. An eerie, unsettling silence fell over the hold, and after fighting to get my breath back, I turned to look into the room.  


Crates and other large boxes rose high around us, seeming to go on forever. Directly ahead, my light glinted off something powder blue. Focusing my light, I saw it had found what looked like an old mid-fifties Cadillac convertible. The top was down, and I saw a matching blue leather interior, accented with white stitching. For a moment, everyone fought to find their breath. Then the Captain spoke. “Okay, boys, we need to find a way out of this hold and back up to the upper decks. Try and find another exit, there *has* to be one” Trying to stay as close to each other as we could, we began to move across the huge hold to find it. I stopped as I reached the Cadillac, reaching out and putting a hand on the quarter panel. The cool metal felt nice against my sweaty hand, and I was suddenly overcome with the feeling that I was about to collapse. My legs felt like jelly under me. *I need to sit for a minute.*   


Sliding down, I put my back against the car and slid to the floor, putting my head in my hands. I felt myself begin to shake as the image of the figures chasing us replayed in my mind. “Get ahold of yourself Nate, you’re okay. You’re okay, just keep it together” I whispered. Suddenly, a voice came from nearby. “Dude, you okay?” It was Vinny. Not wanting him to see my fragile mental state, I chose to keep my head in my hands and nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, just. I just needed a moment to collect myself after that” I mumbled through my fingers. Vinny replied after a moment. “I get that, but. You shouldn’t split up from us. It’s not safe. You know that by now” I sighed; he *was* right. “I know, man”, I began, before letting out a shaky breath, “Just…I honestly don’t know if we’re gonna get off this ship alive. And that scares me” Speaking the truth felt like a massive weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I felt the car rock slightly, indicating he’d leaned against it. He let out a deep breath. “Honestly, Nate…I’ve had the same thought” For a moment, the man’s words comforted me, knowing someone else felt the same.  


Then he continued.  


“But…I mean. Maybe it won’t be so bad” Confusion washed over me. *What?* Vinny’s voice came again. “I mean, come on, eternity onboard a classy ocean liner, surrounded by people who just want others to join them? It can’t be *all* that bad, right? You get to party forever, after all” He let out a snort of laughter. But…it  hadn’t sounded like the way I knew Vinny laughed. His laugh was a deep, booming laugh. This one had been short and nasally. Another chuckle came. The realization suddenly flashed through me as I remembered the radio call yesterday. *They can imitate our voices…* A fresh dose of fear coursed through my veins as I slowly pulled my hands away from my head, suddenly feeling extremely vulnerable and realizing just how stupid I’d been. But…there was nobody there.  


“I mean…after all…*it is inevitable.*”  


The voice came from directly over my head. I began to violently shake, beginning to hyperventilate as I heard all pretext of my crewmate’s voice melt away. I was terrified to look up. But I couldn’t help myself. Slowly, and feeling as though I were about to die of a heart attack at any moment, I craned my neck to look above me.  


A pair of eyes stared down at me, peeking over the side of the Cadillac’s hood. One’s that held both amusement, and malevolence to them.  


The next few moments are nothing but a blur to me. The only thing I can remember is hearing my own shrill screams. That, and blindly running away as I heard the confused, terrified shouts of the others as they attempted to chase after me. I didn’t even become cognizant of anything until I found myself in an unfamiliar foyer. Snapping back to reality, I looked around. I could hear the other’s voice filtering up from below, calling out my name. *What the fuck just happened?* Swallowing, I turned and looked over the railing. I could see the flashlights wildly aiming around. I swallowed, then yelled. “Here! I’m here!” A light flashed up, hitting me in the face and momentarily blinding me. “I found him!” I heard the Captain’s voice call. “Nathan, stay right where you are, we’re coming up!”  


“Alright!” I called back down, then took a step back, aiming my light to see where I was. My light flashed off the sign which declared I’d somehow dashed all the way up to C-Deck. *Three decks?* Then, the image of the eyes staring down at me swam forward in my mind. I began to shake again, hearing the…thing’s voice, imitating Vinny echo inside my head. Trying to calm myself, I took a few steps into the middle of the foyer, aiming my light around. It reflected off another sign, one that stuck out from the wall. *1st Class Swimming Pool*. Beneath it were a set of double doors which stood open, the light inside spilling out into the landing. I couldn’t see much inside, so I took a few more steps until I could see clearly. I blinked a few times. *Am I seeing things?*  


I wasn’t.  


The swimming pool was *packed*. I saw people in old style bathing suits swimming in the pool. A woman wearing a bathing cap swam by heading left, doing the butterfly stroke. The happy cry of children laughing could be heard, and two suddenly flashed by the doorway as they chased one another. I realized music filtered out from the room as well, old swing music which was playing from an intercom inside. None of that was what caused me to gasp. It was who I saw standing across on the other side of the pool. I struggled to find my voice before calling out.  
“W-Will?!”  


At my call, he turned to look at me. A huge grin spread across his face, and he raised an arm to wave at me. He looked nothing less than like the happiest man on the planet.  


And he wasn’t alone.  


A second pair of eyes had turned to regard me at my call. A pair of blue, almost sapphire eyes, ones that, for a moment, made me feel as though I were falling under some kind of spell. Platinum blonde hair bobbed around the shoulders, and voluptuous lips pulled back into a smile. One that held equal amounts of warmth and eeriness to them. She wore a white turtleneck and slacks that accentuated her figure, and a bracelet dangled from one wrist. The lips contorted into a smirk as she snaked an arm around Will’s shoulders, and one eye closed in a wink. I’d never seen the woman before. But instantly, I knew who she was. *Diana*.  


Then the doors to the pool slammed shut on their own.  


“*WILL!*” I screamed, sprinting for the doors as I heard the others reach the landing. I heard them call out to me. But I was ramming my shoulder into the doors, trying desperately to get them to open. “What’s happening?!” I heard the Captain cry out. “Will, he’s in there!” I screamed. Instantly, the others joined me in pushing. After a moment, the doors suddenly swung inwards, almost sending us into the pool. I froze, feeling a wave of shock flash through me.  


The pool was empty.  


*Wha-what?* “No. No, he was there. He was there, and there dozens of people in here as well” I began blabbering out. “There were people, and there was a woman next to him. I swear it had to be one he was talking about, Diana. Then the doors slammed shut and…” I trailed off, looking at the others. Some held frightened expressions on their faces. But some, like Andrew and Spencer, I saw had confused, disbelieving looks on theirs. I felt a wave of anger flash through me. “I’m not *crazy*!” I suddenly began screaming. “I’m not fucking crazy, so don’t you *dare* look at me like that. Not after the hell we just went through down below!” Instantly, I saw reality crash into them; looks of guilt and shame passed over their faces. *They know they’re in the wrong here*. I saw Spencer begin to open his mouth.  


But it was cut off as Wyatt began to scream behind them.  


“You know what? *FUCK THIS*!” The others turned to see him running for another of the red boxes which contained a fire hose and axe. To my shock, he punched straight through the glass with his bare hands. Something that should’ve broken them. But somehow, he yanked an axe from it without a glance at his shredded and bleeding hands. His eyes danced wildly around in his sockets, and I instantly recognized that he’d gone off the deep end. He began to scream again, both at us, and around him in general. “Fuck this, man! I’ve had it with these fuckers dicking us about and trying to drive us insane before they kill us! You fuckers wanna get it on with me! Well that’s fine! Cause I’m coming for you!”  


And with that, he turned and bolted up the stairs for the upper decks.  


“Wyatt, wait!” the Captain yelled. But he was already out of sight. “Come on out, you 20th Century shitheels!” I heard him scream. The Captain turned to us. “Come on, we can’t let him get too far away from us!” We all began sprinting up the stairs, following the man’s voice as ranted and raved about wiping them all out. *He really has gone over the deep end; he’s yelling about killing already dead people with an axe*. Pursuing Wyatt, we reached the Promenade Deck and stopped on the landing.  


Wyatt had stopped screaming.  


The entire ship had gone dead silent. Not just dead silent; a deadly silence that held the worst connotations to it. *Oh…oh, fuck no*, I thought. I saw the same realization reflected in everyone else’s face. I swallowed. “Wyatt?” I called out, my voice muted bouncing off the carpet and wood paneled walls. There was no answer. “Wyatt, buddy, talk to me, where you at?!” Andrew yelled out. Still nothing. And then, slowly at first, a new sound began reaching us. The sound of sobbing and mumbling. “Please…please, I’m sorry. Please, not that” *Wyatt…*  


“Come on!” the Captain urged us, leading the way down the hall towards the lounge. The doors still stood open, and I could see the balloons and decorations still on the floor. As we drew close, my blood turned to ice as I heard Wyatt begin to scream, half angry, half terrified. “No. No, you’re not doing that to me!” The Captain yelled out. “Wyatt, we’re coming!” He was the first to reach the doorway.  


The axe suddenly swung around from the right side of the doorway, faster than I thought possible. In that horrible, split-second, my lips began to yell out a warning. But it was too late.  


The axe buried itself into the Captain’s stomach, stopping the older man dead in his tracks. I heard him let out a strangled cry, more of a gasp as he doubled over. The axe pulled out of him, blood spilling to the floor from the man’s wound. A moment later, Wyatt emerged from around the corner, a wild, insane rage plastered on his face. “I got you, you fucking ghost!” he screamed in the Captain’s face. I saw him raise the axe again, this time high over his head as he screamed again. “Bleed, you shitter!” I saw Vinny and Andrew begin rushing towards him, trying to stop what they saw was coming. 

But again, I saw it was too late.  


I closed my eyes and turned quickly away. I didn’t want to see the axe slam into the Captain’s head…the head of the man who’d taken me under his wing and kept me from going broke. Who’d helped pay for my aunt’s funeral when she passed away. I couldn’t bear to.  


But I heard it. And it’s a sound I’ll never be able to forget.  


Horrified silence settled over the room, and I turned back, feeling like I was about to vomit as I saw the axe buried into his skull. He lay on his back on the floor, a rapidly spreading pool of blood beginning to surround him, staining the carpet. Wide, horrified eyes stared unblinking up at the ceiling, and his mouth was frozen open in shock. The man was very, *very* dead.  


I swung my gaze up. Vinny and Andrew had frozen in place, their arms still stretched out as if to still try and stop the atrocity that had just occurred. Spencer had clapped his hands over his mouth, his face white as a sheet as his body shook uncontrollably. My eyes lifted to the blood splattered face of the Captain’s murderer. The look of insane rage and bloodlust lingered in Wyatt’s eyes for another moment. Then, I saw it die away. Saw him snap back to reality.  


“C-*Captain*?” he asked in a whisper, looking down at the corpse. His breathing quickened, and he lifted his own hands to stare at them. As though he were just beginning to comprehend what he’d done. His eyes lifted to us, and I saw the panic begin to reappear in them. “I-I didn’t know it was him” he began pleading, “I ran into the lounge…and I was completely surrounded by them. They said they were going to kill me. Torture me for eternity, for thinking about stealing from the purser’s office. They called me a coward for crying and breaking down, dared me to attack them!” His voice rose to a scream. “Then they said their leader was coming in, and I heard the most horrible voice coming from the hallway. I swing for my life, and-“He cut off, beginning to shake as violently as Spencer was. He looked directly at me. “I’m sorry” he said simply.  


Then he turned and began sprinting through the lounge. Towards the companionway we’d taken to get inside that first night. We remained frozen for a moment, then began to chase after him. “Wyatt, wait!” Vinny shouted at him. Wyatt’s terrified, hysterical scream flew back at us as he rounded a corner. “Fuck you! I’m not staying onboard this ship! I’ll *swim* home if I have to!” He slammed into the final corner. And a new, horrific realization hit me. I remembered what I thought about the lifeboats when the *Queen Elizabeth* had begun moving. *We’ll be sucked under and…*  


“Wyatt, *DON’T*!” I screamed out as we reached the corner.  


But it was too late. I caught a split-second glimpse of Wyatt flinging himself over the railing. Then he was gone, out of sight. None of us heard a splash. We ran to the railing and peered over. For a moment, we saw nothing. Then, Wyatt’s head broke the water’s surface, coughing out water as he began to thrash, attempting to swim away from the ship.  


Then he was pulled under.  


“Oh, fuck!” Spencer yelled, then began running for the stern of the ship,Vinny, Andrew and I right behind him. Part of me prayed that he would miss the propellers, that he’d be spat out the back of the ship. Drowning would be a less painful way to die than this. But as we reached the stern railing, I felt despair and horror flood into me.  


Seeing the dark red stain emerge from beneath the ship, spread out with the foam which drifted behind us in the ship’s wake.  


We stood there for a long time, staring out at the water as if doing so would return our lost crewmate. Our lost *friend*. We could’ve been there minutes. We could’ve been there hours. All I know is, the next thing I knew, I was looking up to see the sun beginning to set on the horizon. None of us knew what to do. We were numb. Numb and unable to function. So, we did the only thing we could do. We went back to our cabin. And locked the door.  


That’s where I am now. There's only five of us left now. The others have, for the life of me, I don’t know how, managed to fall asleep. I can only guess so much mental and physical energy was sapped from them, to the point they *couldn’t* stay awake, even if they wanted to. Me? I’m too afraid to sleep. Afraid I’ll dream of the horrifying things I’ve seen today. Of the figures. Of the voice, the eyes staring hungrily down at me from over the hood of the car in the hold. Of Wyatt…either driven insane, or hallucinating, a false image brought on by these ghosts…plunging the axe into the Captain’s body. And of him disappearing into the water…of him being sliced to pieces by the giant propeller blades.  


This ship is doing everything it can to drive us insane, have us kill each other, or just flat out take us. It’s already taken Will. I know he’s lost now. There’s no way to bring him back. He’s one of *them* now. And it makes me realize something. I said that there was only five of us left. But...in reality, there's only four. For how much longer, though…I don’t know. The compass I have in my supplies spins around nonstop. I can’t even tell which direction we’re heading in. And I don’t know how to position our location by the stars. The only person who knew how to do that was the Captain. And…he’s dead.  


All I know is this. I’m not just going to roll over and let the ship take me. I’m going to fight to try and find a way off. To help get myself, and the others back home. Or die trying. Will might have wanted to stay in the 1950s forever, but I want to go back to the peace and normality of 2023. Compared to this hell, the relative peace and normality, anyways.  


I don’t know, though. Do any of you guys have any ideas? Any ideas at all of what to do now? Even if it’s the dumbest idea in the world, I’ll take it. Anything’s better than just letting the hopelessness overwhelm me. Just…please, give us any direction to take, that might help us get off this damned ship. Please…  


The music has started again. I hear it filtering through the walls. A different tune now. But again, one I recognize. *Sing, Sing, Sing*, by Benny Goodman. That’s not the worst part, though.  
Someone began softly knocking a few minutes ago on the cabin door. And then began calling in, asking for us to come and join the party. The voice that asked it was Will’s. And then, another voice joined him. A woman’s voice, one that asked the same question with a British accent. And finally…a third voice. One that made me want to break down in tears. The Captain’s voice. The implications pierce my heart and soul like a dagger.  


To Will, this ship was…*is*, heaven. A place where he can eternally spend frozen in the time period he wanted to go back to.  


To me, it’s hell.
