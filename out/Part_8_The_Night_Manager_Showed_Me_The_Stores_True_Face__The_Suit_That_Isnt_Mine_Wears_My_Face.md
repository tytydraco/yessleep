The handprint on my shoulder had gotten worse.

Not just bruised—wrong.

Thin, ink-dark veins spidered outward beneath my skin, pulsing faintly like something alive was pushing back against my touch. Every beat throbbed up my neck and into my jaw, a constant reminder that it wasn’t just a mark—it was ownership.

I didn’t sleep. I couldn’t.

Every time I shut my eyes, the store appeared—stripped of light, stripped of walls, just endless aisles stretching into black. My own footsteps echoed on tile, but there was always another set, a half-beat behind mine. Close enough to feel breath on the back of my neck, but far enough I could never turn fast enough to catch it.

And in the dark, his voice.

*You’re already mine. The evaluation is just a formality.*

By the time my alarm went off, I was already dressed—because I’m a big believer in dying prepared. The drive felt less like a commute and more like I was being chauffeured to my own execution.

The parking lot was empty. No cars. No light. No sound. But when I touched the glass door, it unlocked on its own.

Inside, the air was wrong—warm in a way that felt like skin, not climate. It clung to me, thick and damp, carrying no scent but its weight. The silence wasn’t empty—it was watching. Every hair on my arms stood up.

Then came the footsteps.

Mismatched. One too long, the next too short. Coming from somewhere between the canned goods and the registers.

I rounded the endcap and stopped.

He was there.

The Night Manager.

Perfect suit, perfect posture, perfect face—his beauty had the kind of precision you only see in magazine spreads, but on him, it felt like taxidermy. This time, he wasn’t behind a counter or hidden in shadow. He stood in the center aisle, beneath a flawless halo of fluorescent light.

“Welcome,” he said, smiling in a way that made my stomach clench. “Your last test.”

His eyes… yesterday, they had glowed an unholy shade that didn’t belong to humans. Now they were just green. Normal. Except they weren’t. They looked like they’d been painted that way, as if he’d borrowed them for the night.

“Hello… Mr. Night Manager,” I said. I tried for flat and calm, but my voice caught halfway through his title.

“Remi,” he said, as if tasting the name. “Nervous? Excited? Dread? Isn’t it delicious, how the body betrays itself?”

I didn’t answer. I just kept my face still, even as my heartbeat felt like it was trying to hammer its way out of my ribs.

He stared long enough that my skin prickled. Then he turned, expecting me to follow.

We stopped at the basement door.

I knew that door.

I’d locked something behind it my first shift—the thing that chased me around the store, its jaw unhinged as it tried to swallow me whole.

“Don’t worry,” he said, without looking at me. “The mutt you locked in there has been… dealt with.”

His gloved hand rested on the handle. Black leather creaked softly.

“Behind this door,” he said, “is the store’s true form. Everything upstairs? A mask. The creatures you’ve met? Fragments. Dead skin cells of something much, much larger.”

The lights above us seemed to dim, though I never saw them flicker. “The rules you’ve learned,” he continued, “still apply. Always.” He then held up his hand. Five fingers splayed.

The size matched the shape burning on my shoulder exactly.

“There are five checkpoints. You will pass through each and collect a fragment. Complete them all, and you will be promoted to Assistant Night Manager. My right hand.”

The way he said right hand made it sound less like a job title and more like an organ transplant.

“You’ll have the same authority as me,” he added, and for a heartbeat, something hungry flashed in his borrowed green eyes.

He turned the handle. The door opened with a sigh, exhaling warm, lightless air that smelled faintly of old copper and wet earth. The darkness beyond wasn’t absence of light—it was matter. It clung to the frame, thick and slow-moving, as though it had to make room for me to enter.

“You’ll know where the checkpoints are,” he said, smiling until his lips pulled too far across his teeth. “You already carry my mark.”

Then, with one smooth motion, he pushed me forward.

The moment my foot crossed the threshold, the warmth swallowed me whole. The familiar hum and clang of the store above vanished like they’d never existed.

The place looked the same at first—familiar aisles bathed in harsh fluorescent light—but something inside me twisted with unease. The air was thick, almost viscous, like breathing through wet cloth. The walls seemed to stretch and pulse subtly, as if the store was breathing around me. I wandered through the employee office, the reception, searching for something normal. Nothing. The space stretched impossibly, folding in on itself. This store was figuratively endless.

A voice—soft, dragging—echoing down from the vents above.

“Remi…”

I ran away from the sound, heart pounding. The voice seemed to follow me through the store. I reached the canned goods aisle and tried whistling, a sharp, brittle sound to cut the tension—but it did nothing. Shadows spilled from the cracks between shelves like smoke, curling and twisting. They reached for me with thin, desperate fingers. Their whispers rose:

“We can tell you where his heart lies.”

“Whose?” I gasped, stumbling back.

“It is hidden in plain sight. We are forbidden to tell you directly.”

The shadows multiplied, swallowing the aisle in cold darkness. Their skin was a sickly blue, stretched tight over bones—zombie pale but ghostly translucent. Each wore a faded, tattered employee vest, remnants of forgotten shifts.

Their voices blended into a haunting refrain, each word a dagger:

“*Time stands still where shadows meet,*

*Between the heart of store and heat.*

*The keeper’s pulse you seek to find,*

*Ticks softly, hidden just behind.*”

And then I saw her.

Selene.

My breath caught. She floated there, but her form was shattered—head disconnected, drifting like a ghostly orb, limbs severed yet eerily suspended in space.

“Remi…” Selene’s voice rasped like broken glass dragged over metal. “Get out. Now.”

“I can’t,” I whispered, panic chewing at the edges of my voice. “What happened to you?”

Her severed head drifted closer, eyes flicking to the shadows spilling into the aisle like ink in water. “No time.”

“Do you know the five checkpoints?” I pressed, forcing the words out before she could vanish.

“Yes.” One of her detached hands floated up, trembling, and pointed toward the canned goods. “One is here. One of the cans holds the first fragment.”

I didn’t hesitate. I ran back to the aisle, eyes scanning every can.

At the far end, a can glowed faintly.

But moving toward it were writhing worms—pale, each about four feet long, their mouths grotesquely spiraled with wide, jagged teeth. Seven of them crawled in unison, hissing through clenched jaws.

“They can hear,” Selene hissed sharply, her voice slicing through the darkness just as the shadows lunged at her, desperate to silence her warning.

I had to be silent. The creatures had no eyes, but the silence was thick with their awareness. Every breath, every heartbeat echoed in the dark.

My fingers curled around a can. With trembling resolve, I hurled it hard against the wall behind the glowing can.

The sharp clang shattered the silence.

The worms twisted violently, sensing the noise, their bodies contorting with unnatural speed and jerky spasms.

I held my breath, muscles still.

When the path cleared, I lunged forward, grabbing the glowing can just as the worms surged in a flurry of slick, snapping mouths and writhing bodies.

One slammed into my jacket, teeth scraping through fabric like paper.

I tore away my jacket, stumbling into the drinks aisle, my breath ragged and my skin crawling with cold sweat.

The can pulsed brighter in my palm, almost alive. I peeled the lid back and dug through the can until my fingers hit something solid. The first fragment—cold, jagged metal—rested in my palm, clearly just a piece of something far greater.

That’s when the pain hit.

It wasn’t a stab or a burn—it was both, burrowing deep. My shoulder seared as if hooked from the inside. I tore at my shirt and saw the handprint. The fingers burned molten red, heat rolling off them like open furnace doors. Then—before my eyes—the pinky finger print began to dissolve, shrinking into my flesh, sinking deeper until there was nothing left but smooth skin.

“What the—” I froze mid-sentence as something caught my eye.

Someone was standing at the reception desk, holding a bell in one hand. He looked right at me, and my stomach dropped. His skin was waxy-pale, hair a dull blond that caught the dim light like old straw. He didn’t move, but something in me—some pull I couldn’t name—dragged me toward him.

Halfway there, my shoulder ignited. One of the burned-in fingerprints flared, a single finger dissolving on my skin all over again. Three finger prints still seared on my shoulder.

“Who are you?” the figure asked, his voice hollow, as if it came from somewhere far away.

“My name is Remi,” I said, my eyes flicking down to what remained of his tattered vest. The faded name tag stopped me cold. Jack.

“Jack… do you know Selene?” The question left my mouth before I’d even thought about it.

“Yeah.” His gaze darted to the shadows, scanning for something—or someone. “Do you know where the second piece of the fragment is?” I pressed.

“It’s with him,” Jack whispered, and before I could ask who him was, he shoved me hard beneath the reception desk.

The bell clanged—once, twice, three times—on its own. Then I saw him.

The Pale Man.

He moved with inhuman swiftness, seizing Jack by the shoulders. Jack’s face twisted in a silent scream as the Pale Man dragged him into the aisles. It happened so fast, I forgot to breathe.

I scrambled to my feet, the air heavy with the fading echo of the bell. That’s when I saw it—lying beneath the counter, glinting faintly under the bell. The second fragment.

But it reeked of a trap. My pulse hammered as my eyes darted toward the breakroom door. Without another thought, I snatched the shard and ran.

The Pale Man came after me—fast, too fast—closing the gap in seconds. I threw myself into the breakroom and slammed the door shut just as two pale, skeletal handprints pressed against the other side. The iron groaned under the force.

“Remi?”

The voice came from behind me—soft, broken, like wind trying to force its way through cracked glass. I turned, and my stomach lurched. The burnt smell hit me first. 

A figure sat slouched in the breakroom chair, her body charred black in some places and melted in others. Half her face was gone, teeth bared in a permanent, awful grin where skin had burned away. The air reeked of scorched flesh and something sweet, like caramelized sugar left to burn too long.

Her head tilted unnaturally far to the side, and her waxy, cracked skin shifted with the motion. “You’re… supposed to put the… two fragments together,” she rasped, every word dragging over her throat like broken glass.

My eyes dropped to the half-burnt vest clinging to her ruined torso. Through the soot and melted fabric, I could just make out the letters: “STA—”. That was enough. My voice caught.

“Stacy?”

She didn’t blink. Didn’t breathe. Just watched me, as though the act of staring was the only thing keeping her upright.

I swallowed hard but did as she said. My hands shook while I pressed the fragments together. They fused instantly with a hiss, the seams vanishing until I held a single, jagged metallic shard in my palm.

“Here,” she said, dropping something cold and heavy into my other hand—a third fragment. My shoulder burned again, another fingerprint dissolving. “You have… five minutes… to make it to the loading dock.” She hissed as she shoved me out the breakroom.

“What—?”

The word hadn’t even left my mouth before the air changed. A sudden whoomph of heat rolled over me, the oxygen in the room evaporating as flames erupted from the walls and ceiling. Stacy’s body twisted violently, her back arching with a wet, tearing sound. Bone punched through skin. Her charred flesh split like overcooked meat as eight spindly legs clawed their way out of her torso. Her head twisted fully backward, lips peeling away to reveal too many teeth.

“Reeeemiiii—”

The sound was less a name and more a screech that rattled the air. I ran and behind me, Stacy’s spider-like frame slammed against the ground, legs skittering in bursts of impossible speed. The sound of claws dragging across the tile was deafening.

I dove through the dock entrance, slamming the heavy door shut just as her limbs smashed against it. Two blackened handprints instantly pressed against the metal leaving long streaks before vanishing.

“You’re here early.”

The voice came from deeper inside the dock.

I turned to see him—the old man. His skin looked grayer than last time, his eyes hollow.

“Old man…” I gasped, clutching my chest.

“Remi… I failed this part.” His voice cracked on the word “failed.” He stepped closer, pressing something cold and sharp into my palm—a fragment.

“Don’t look at her.”

Before I could ask, he grabbed me with both hands and shoved me—hard—out of the loading dock.

“Why is everyone—”

“Do you have some meat?”

The voice was right in front of me—smooth, lilting, wrong. My gut twisted. I knew that voice.

The Pale Lady.

My head almost turned, instinct screaming to look at her, but the old man’s voice echoed sharp and clear in my skull: Don’t look at her.

“Yes… it’s in the freezers,” I muttered to the floor, forcing my eyes to stay down.

Somewhere above me, she smiled. I could hear it—thin and wet, like teeth scraping against glass.

Her presence pressed against my back as I walked toward the freezer doors. Each step felt colder, heavier. I kept my eyes forward, but when I motioned to show her where the meat was, my gaze caught the reflection.

I broke the rule.

The Pale Lady’s laughter erupted, jagged and high-pitched, ricocheting off the walls like nails dragging down steel. She flung the doors open, frost spilling out in choking clouds. My skin burned from the cold as she reached in, grabbed her “meat,” and glided away.

But my breath froze when I saw what was inside. Buried under the frost, entombed in ice, was me—frozen solid. My lips moved soundlessly, begging for something I couldn’t hear. I was wearing the Night Manager’s suit. My own eyes stared back at me, stretched too wide, an ear-to-ear smile splitting my face like a wound.

“You looked,” it murmured. Its voice was my voice, but wet, warped. “Now I can take you.”

A gloved hand pushed through the glass—skin-tight leather stretched over fingers that were just a little too long. Resting in its open palm was the final fragment. “But I’ll give you a choice… give me a piece of your soul, and I’ll give you the last fragment.”

I inched backward. “How do I know it’s real?”

The mimic chuckled—a deep, bubbling sound that made my stomach twist. “Make the deal… and find out.”

It was still laughing when I lunged forward, snatching the fragment from its grasp— and then I ran.

“You made a deaaal…” it shrieked, the words tearing out of the glass like splintered metal, warping until they were almost unrecognizable.

Then it stepped through.

It was my body—but stretched and wrong—seven feet of trembling, elongated limbs, joints popping in sickening bursts with every lurch forward. Its head twitched in short, broken jerks, eyes locked on mine, its smile stretching until the skin at the corners of its mouth threatened to tear.

It didn’t run. It slid—fast, too fast—down the aisle, its every step perfectly mirroring mine like my shadow had finally come alive.

Something cold and slick coiled around my ankle. I looked down—its hand, pale and gloved, fingers tightening until I felt my bones grind. I kicked hard, once, twice—until the grip broke and my shoe came off in its grasp.

I threw myself through the basement door.

The thing hit the threshold and stopped. Its too-long arms scraped against the frame, nails raking deep grooves into the invisible barrier. Slowly, its head tilted, further… further… until the wet pop of a tendon snapping echoed in the narrow hall. And still, that smile.

I slammed the door shut, chest heaving.

In the muffled dark beyond it, something breathed—soft, shallow inhales, so close I could almost feel the warmth through the metal.

I didn’t wait to see if it would try again. I climbed the stairs back to the store, my legs shaking.

The clock read 5:51 a.m. 

The fragments in my hand felt wrong—like they were vibrating faintly, eager to be whole. I pressed them together, and the pieces sealed with a faint click, forming a dagger. Its blade gleamed silver, cold as ice, the hilt wrapped in black leather and etched with curling snakes that almost seemed to move.

“Remiiiii,” the Night Manager’s voice rang out, too cheerful, too loud. He appeared from nowhere, grinning like he’d been watching the whole time.

“I knew you could do it,” he said, clapping my shoulder with a weight that sank straight into bone. “You are officially Assistant Night Manager.”

The cheer drained from his voice as he leaned in, lips almost touching my ear.

“Don’t disappoint me.”

Then he straightened and strolled toward the exit, not looking back.

“Oh—your new uniform will be ready tomorrow.”

The word uniform made my stomach knot. My mind flashed to my mimic wearing the Night Manager’s suit—its smile too wide, its eyes too dark.

I stepped out into the empty parking lot, the world feeling like it wasn’t quite real. The dawn air bit at me, cold enough to remind me of my missing jacket… and the shoe I’d left behind.

“You’re alive!”

Dante’s voice broke the spell as he ran to me, pulling me into a hug so tight it felt desperate—like he was afraid I’d dissolve if he let go.

“Yeah,” I managed, a shaky laugh slipping out.

The ache in my shoulder was gone. I tugged my collar aside. The burned-in handprint had vanished, replaced by smooth, untouched skin.

I showed Dante the dagger and told him what the shadows of former employees had whispered to me:

*"Time stands still where shadows meet,*

*Between the heart of store and heat.*

*The keeper’s pulse you seek to find,*

*Ticks softly, hidden just behind."*

The location of the Night Manager’s heart.

And I knew exactly what this dagger was meant for.
