The bathroom doors in the lobby were kicked in again. Probably just the kids from the trailer park behind the diner, but I was already in a foul mood when I started my rounds.

I’ve worked the night shift at this Motel 6 for three years. Usually, my biggest headache is cleaning up after a tweaker or arguing over a pet deposit. But last night, I’m pretty sure I watched a man get deleted.

It started with Room 114.

The guy checked in around 4 PM. He looked like a surveyor boots caked in Mojave dust, sunburned neck, hands shaking so badly he could barely hold his ID. He didn't even ask for a key card; he just asked if the lobby PC was still connected to the local exchange.

I told him it was ancient and barely online. He just nodded and sat down anyway. He stayed there for six hours. He didn’t eat or drink. He just hammered at the keyboard like he was racing a timer.

The auditor arrived at 2 AM. She didn’t wear a dress or heels; she wore a charcoal pantsuit and carried a tablet. She looked like a corporate inspector from the home office. She didn't glance at the desk, she just walked straight past me toward the 100-block.

I called out that she needed to register, but she didn't turn around. She just tapped her stylus against the tablet click, click, click and vanished around the corner.

When I followed her, the hallway was silent. The surveyor was gone, but his truck was still in the lot. I went to the lobby PC to log him out and saw the Reddit thread he’d left open. It was a post about a "loud lamp" and a passenger list. I thought it was a joke until I saw the view count.

Seventy thousand. Not an estimate. Seventy thousand flat.

I went to Room 114. The door was propped open with a heavy brass plate wedged in the frame. The room didn’t smell like a motel; it smelled like a server room that had lost its cooling hot copper and burnt plastic.

The bed hadn't been slept in. In the center of the duvet was a pile of white, curved shards. I picked one up. It wasn't ceramic. It was warm and felt like a thick fingernail, or the curve of a human rib. It was bone-dry. No blood. Just a man reduced to calcium and lime.

I tried to call the manager, Dave, but the lines were dead. When I found him in the back office, he was staring at the security monitors. The screens weren't showing the lot. They were showing a scrolling list of names and technical data.

“The numbers have to balance, Pete,” he whispered. He didn't look at me. “Don’t look at the list. If you see your name, the count is finished.”

I went to the bathroom to splash water on my face. My reflection was wrong. Every time I blinked, I heard it a faint, mechanical shutter sound inside my skull. Click.

The routers on the wall were screaming. Not just traffic, but seventy thousand pings per second hitting this building like a circuit.

My teeth were vibrating so hard I thought they would crack. I could hear a low whistle, like a train, but there are no tracks for twenty miles. I checked the lobby PC one last time. The view count hit 70,001.

There is a man at the front desk now. He’s wearing my uniform, but his skin has the same matte-white texture as the bone shards in Room 114.

He isn't moving.

He’s just holding a tray with a single brass plate on it.

He is waiting for me to check him in.

But I think he’s actually here to check me out
