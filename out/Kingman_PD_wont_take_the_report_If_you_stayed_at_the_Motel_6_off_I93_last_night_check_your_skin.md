Toilet doors in the lobby have been kicked in again. Probably just the kids from the trailer park behind the diner, but I was already in a foul mood when I started my rounds.

I have worked the night shift at this Motel 6 for three years. Usually my biggest headache is cleaning up after a tweaker or arguing with some guy about a pet deposit. But last night I am pretty sure I watched a man get deleted.

It started with Room 114.

The guy checked in around 4 PM. He looked like a surveyor. Boots caked in Mojave dust. Sunburned neck. Hands shaking so badly he could barely hold his ID. He did not even ask for a key card. Just asked if the lobby PC still worked.

I told him it was ancient and barely online. He nodded like he expected that and sat down anyway. He stayed there for hours. Did not eat or drink. Just hammering the keyboard like he was racing something.

I would not have noticed him leave if it was not for the woman.

She came into the lobby a little after 2 AM. Red dress, heels, hair done. Nice, The kind of person who does not end up at a budget motel in Kingman by accident. Thought a Pro for a second, but no way.

I stood up to greet her, but she did not even glance at the desk. Walked straight past me toward the hallway.

I called out that she needed to register. She vanished around the corner of the vending machines.

When I went to follow her, the lobby was dead silent. The surveyor was gone. His truck was still in the lot. I went over to the PC to log him out and saw a Reddit thread he had left open. It was about a ghost station and a passenger list. I thought it was fiction until I saw the view count.

Seventy thousand. Not an estimate. Seventy thousand flat.

I went to Room 114. The door was propped open with a Bible from the nightstand. I thought maybe she was in there. The room was off. It smelled like iron and flowers. Like a funeral home in the middle of a car crash.

The bed had not been slept in. But right in the middle of the duvet was a pile of white chips. I picked one up. It was not ceramic. It was warm. Felt like a thick fingernail, the curve of a human rib. No blood, no mess. Just bone dry shards left on the polyester spread.

I tried to call my manager, Dave, but the phone lines were dead. When I finally found him in the back office, he would not even look at me. He was staring at the security monitors. The screens were just static. He kept saying, “The numbers have to balance, Pete. Do not look at the list.”

I splashed water on my face and looked in the mirror. My eyes looked wrong. Every blink made a clicking sound, like a camera. The routers were making a noise on the dashboard. Not just traffic. Seventy thousand pings coming back into this building like a circuit.

My teeth were vibrating so hard I thought they would crack. The floor shook. There were no tracks, but I could hear the whistle. The smell of flowers was everywhere. I could not breathe. It was like petals in my lungs.

Tap your wrist. Do it now. If it sounds like stone or if you hear a camera click when you blink, you are on the list.

The counter hit seventy thousand and one. There was a man in the hall. He wore our uniform, but his skin was white like the plate in the room. He carried a tray. A card hung from his neck. The name tag said seventy thousand and one.

He is coming to the desk. I cannot lock the door. He is coming to check me out.
