The bedroom is bathed in night. The pale blue glow of the lights outside stream through my blinds like the mist of a forgotten dream. The air is still and cold. There's a silence that weighs down on me thickly enough to pull me from the state of unconiousness I was in. I know it's going to happen before I feel it.

Something pushes up against the bottom of my box spring. Slow. Deliberate. It almost feels like it's cutting through the mattress. My body is rigid. I focus on my breathing, trying to stay calm. I'm scared that if I move, it will move faster.

Even though I expect it to do like it's done the last few days, it still catches me off guard. I flinch hard at the feeling of its ice cold fingers on my back.

I lurch over the side of the bed, hoping to finally catch it in the act. Hoping it's moving. But everything stills again. In the darkness, the hand looks grey and withered. It lays motionless. Not like it just stopped moving but like it's been tossed there and forgotten. The beams of a passing car sweep across the room. The peeling blue nail polish sparkles in the flash of light.

A flicker of life.
A pang of guilt.

My mind buries the memories of the next few hours. The hole I dug is deeper than before. I thought the saying was six feet under. That didn't keep them down though. Maybe eight feet will do the trick.

Finding myself back in the room, I stand. I wait. My eyes are locked on the bed, envisioning them underneath it. Just out of sight. Knowing there's something there but not knowing in what state it will be this time.

"Deep breath in. Deep breath out." I squeeze my eyes shut, focusing on the thoughts. "They're dead. They're dead."


I walk over to where the hand still lays unmoved. I can see the pale form the hand is attached to crammed into that underbed space. Beside it lays another form, pale and gaunt as much as the first. Though the second is larger and more muscular. It was harder to take down.

The hardest part however comes as I crouch down, angling my neck to peer underneath the bed. The darkness under there is unnatural. Darker than pitch. It's what peers back at me that freezes me.

Their eyes stare at me, following my subtle movement. Watching my face. Wide, terrified eyes that sink back into their skulls. White circles with darken pits are pupils.Their faces are frozen in their fear and cries. 

Their screams. 

The screams I drowned out and ignored. Though their mouths don't move, I hear their voices; pleading me - urging me to look at them.

"Witness us."

I squeeze my eyes shut. My breathing quickens. My heart beats in my ears.

When I open my eyes again, I'm shoveling the first scoop of dirt into the grave. The last thing I see is that woman's eyes staring back up at me, the male laying face down in the dirt underneath her. For a moment, she looks like she's about to speak. Then the dirt covers her face.

I hesitate for a moment, waiting to see if she'll move. But she doesn't. The hole is filled. The top covered. I grab a pile of leaves and branches, scattering it over the spot to make it look natural. 

The sky begins to lighten as I'm finishing up. I grab everything I brought with, checking and triple checking before I decide it's spotless.

Then I leave.

Hopefully I'll be able to sleep tonight.
