Oneiromancy: the method of divining the future or previously undiscovered knowledge through the observation of dreams. Folk get it into their head either by influencers who practice occultism or just from their own curiosity that they too can utilize their dreams to spy on the future, get ahead of the curve on their favourite stock picks, or avoid catastrophe.



The lucky ones are the majority who watch a tutorial on Youtube and end up giving up after their “guide to the underworld” gets too convoluted with their demands and the power to find out if alcohol really will ruin their life isn’t something they need to know that badly. They’re lucky because they get to continue to live blissfully in ignorance.



The ones we ought to pity are the studious, the ones who can sniff out the wheat from the chaff. The ones who can make sense of the nonsense, the ancient writings in old tomes that should’ve been burned ages ago. These people ended up getting their hands on legitimate instructions, instructions that I should add: are brutally simple.



The language of dreams are symbols that require an information schema that will allow for such knowledge to be carried across from the wealth of knowledge drawn into our senses every millisecond, to our everyday easy to understand consciousness. I too am a man of science and so I’ll put it in terms our dear old engineering friends can understand.



The body intakes unfathomable information through its senses, this information is mostly filtered out, after all if you’re a caveman just trying to catch its fill for the day, there’s no need to hear every droplet of water hitting your skull as you douse yourself to clear away the muck. However this information doesn’t simply disappear, it stays with you and can be passed on genetically to children.



Everyone of us in fact, has therefore inherited a wealth of information from millions of years of our ancestors living their daily lives. This wealth of information eludes our understanding but its presence has been sensed from people throughout every era. Its unresponsiveness to the demands of human consciousness to spill its desired contents is a useful hint. It treats us like how we treat ants, it passes through our lives like a giant taking a single step, whereas by the time we chase after its shadow, our individual lives have already reached its end.



There is one moment however, that it responds, not to mindful demands or bartering, but emotional bearing of the soul. Moments in our lives that touched us, moments where we were filled with such bitter rage, we bled from our nose. Moments where we were filled with such whole hearted joy we healed old scars.



These moments leave imprints on us, that, like Adam reaching out his finger, he very nearly comes into contact with god. They live as personalities, and take substance and shape in our dreams. They may seem like actors, these figures in your dreams. But I can assure you, they do not lose their properties once the dream has ended, and what happens in a dream isn’t just immaterial, without lasting consequences.



Those tomes I spoke of earlier? They have one, single, damned instruction.



Treat your dreamscape, and the figures in your dreams as if they were real.



That’s it.



A child could do it!



As they often do…



There was no warning however, although to anyone who’s scholarly, perhaps it should have been self-evident, what happens if you treat dreams as if they were real.



Reality isn’t something we can consciously rip ourselves away from, if you seek secret knowledge then you’ll get your wish, and then some.



The dreams!



They don’t stop!



For a whole month, wraiths lived in my home… corpse-like women with pale horrible expressions! They haunted me by my windowsill… where I dreamt them up. Demanding my fingers and menacing me when I refuse! Fuck, the screams I heard! I cried most nights till I passed out.



I cowered in my blanket but I could hear the troll underneath my bed, swinging its arm around, trying to find a loose leg or an arm it could grab hold of never showing its face or leaving from under my bed. That month my bed smelled foul because I never left either.



The lake outside my home had grown so foggy and dark at night, I sometimes thought of going there to end it all. When the moon shined its reflection on it, it almost seemed as if I could follow that light out of this nightmare.



Then for a week I fucked beautiful naked women during the day who do nothing but wait for me by my bedside, then I leave them to chase my childhood friend who sparkles in a sundress in the meadows.



I reveal myself to her and feel terribly embarrassed when I do so, she laughs and I lose all that joy because I know I’ll never see her again. I drove her away with my indecency.



Last week I walked into my living room and saw my daughter, the one I dreamt up, lying on her belly coloring slightly outside the lines of the picture book I gave her. I lifted her up in my arms and felt such elation. I felt like I was blessed far more than anyone else!



I felt the last bits of my heart wither away when I brushed her hair for the final time, buried her in the backyard by the apple tree we planted together.



I don’t care if I’ve missed something, you don’t really care about doing things the right way when it comes to your own suicide. I left the note by the medicine cabinet above my kitchen sink, hard to miss it when my sister comes home. Got the rope from a hardware store nearby, the cashier was the last person I talked to, he mentioned I had bags under my eyes and told me to get some good sleep. I couldn’t handle the irony and laughed like a madman there for twenty minutes. five minutes inside the building and fifteen in the parking lot. 



After reflecting a bit on all that's transpired these short few months, I thought I’d try and warn anyone who’s even a little interested in the topic of dreams, dream analysis, dream interpretation- I don’t give a fuck!



Drop it.



Please, they don’t stop coming once you open the floodgates.



I’m not gonna bother reading your replies, or empty platitudes. This is the only way this’ll stop, I know it because I saw it in my dreams.
