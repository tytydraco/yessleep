My grandmother always told me the story of the boy when I was growing up. I'm not sure why she ever shared it with me, it scared me to death and brought nightmares every time. It went something like this: 

"The boy stood and straightened his jacket. It was a dirty shade of aquamarine, splattered with mud and frayed at the edges. He isn’t sure why he still has the jacket, let alone why he still wears it, but it gives him a false sense of security now. He shudders at the thought of the jacket's history. 

The boy didn’t realize it, but his off-brand sneakers are soaked in a deep scarlet paint that follows him as he walks away. 

He glides between buildings, keeping his movements confined to the shadows and darkness, and makes his way, well, anywhere. He did not plan ahead. He is uncertain about what comes next, but he does know that he needs to go. Go far away from where he was. Where he had been. 

The boy tries to control his trembling hands. They’re so cold. So unsteady. It’s no use trying to stop the shaking. He stuffs his hands back into his jacket. He shudders at the thought of the jacket’s history. 

Tap. Tap. Tap.

He turns his head to the left, looking for the source of the noise. He looks to the right. He looks up. Rain. He zips up his jacket, pulls the hood up and over his head, and tightens the drawstrings. He needs a reprieve of the suffocating aquamarine. He shudders at the thought of the jacket’s history. 

The only place he thinks to go is to the train. Surrounded by faceless, nameless strangers. Yes, the train will be just fine. 

The rain is picking up now. A slow drizzle turns into a heavy rainfall turns into a torrential downpour. He sticks to the edges of buildings, finding shelter under awnings and overhangs. Someone opens the door to a passing restaurant, the smell of warm food is intoxicating. But he is too nervous to be hungry. Too shocked at what he had done. 

The boy keeps going, one foot in front of the other. Head low. Eyes down. He sees the train station up ahead. Only one right turn and then straight about one hundred yards. He is almost there. To his escape. 

He sharply turns the corner.

“Hey! Watch where you’re going!” 

The shock of hearing another voice stops the boy immediately. He isn’t used to others speaking to him. He looks up. The girl is soaking wet. Shivering. A skinny little thing, clearly running away from her own problems, too. Maybe they aren’t so different. He considers her for a moment. 

“Here.” The boy unzips the jacket, eager to get rid of the wretched thing. He hurriedly hands it over to the girl, looking behind her at the boarding train. 

“I can’t take this,” the girl shakes her head, “not when it’s raining outside. You need it.”

“Take it.” He looks at the girl and then at the jacket. A silent plea dances in his eyes, begging her to take the jacket and relieve him of the memories. 

“Alright.” He is still trembling. So is she, though. He noticed. The boy starts to walk past the girl, but she says one last thing. “Hey, you got something on your shoes.” 

The boy looks down and his eyes widen in horror. Without a second thought, he kicks off the shoes and throws them towards the girl. “Take those, too.”

The boy continues towards the train station, feeling free. Free of his past. What he had done. What he had to do. He boards the train. He finds a seat in the back. One that nobody else will want. He silently watches two raindrops race down the traincar window. 

He thinks of nothing other than the mangled body he left behind."

Horrible, right? Well, my grandmother passed away last week. It was sad, but it was her time. I got my answer though. About why she would tell me that story. 

As we were going through her belongings and getting her house ready for auction, I was tasked with hauling  the things down from the attic. One box after another made its way downstairs until finally I made it to the last item: a locked oak chest. 

Naturally, I had to know what was in there. I grabbed some wire cutters from my grandmother's garage and sliced through the dainty padlock holding the lid closed. What I saw inside made me fall to my knees. 

It was tattered and dirty, but still unmistakably aquamarine. It was the jacket.
