The building hums your name when it’s ready to feed. That’s how you know it’s too late.

I’ve worked security here for six years. I had a partner once, Mark. He said he heard humming in the ductwork one night and went to check it out.

We found his badge melted to the floor. There was no sign of his body.

It is now 10 years later...

"For the last damn time, this building isn't cursed or haunted, it's radioactive! Your magic chants and potions aren't gonna do SHIT!"I shouted the words hard enough to echo down the crumbling corridor, past rusted pipes and cracked lead-lined walls. The silence that followed was thick, thicker than it should’ve been. The kind of silence that is almost oppressive and frays on your nerves, making the air feel like static building up before lightning strikes.

The girl in the velvet cloak didn’t even blink. She just kept drawing her chalk sigils on the floor like this was some midnight séance and not an abandoned government fallout lab sitting on top of enough enriched uranium to boil a city block. Her friend, some wiry guy with glassy eyes and a pendant made of animal teeth, whispered a Latin phrase that I swear made the air grow colder. Or maybe that was just the draft from the busted ventilation system.

I know what this place is. It’s not haunted. It’s not possessed. It’s a fucking wound in the earth that never scabbed over.

I thought they’d run when the lights flickered. Most do. This place has a way of getting under your skin. But these two? They just smiled wider, like a couple of children at a carnival. I stepped closer, boots crunching over broken glass and paint chips flaking off like skin. “Whatever you think you’re summoning, you’re not. You’re just stirring up shit best left buried.” The girl looked up at me, her pupils blown wide like black holes. “We’re not summoning,” she whispered. “We’re listening.”

I opened my mouth to argue, and that’s when the Geiger counter on my belt let out a scream. Not a normal tick. Not the anxious stutter it gives when the old cores breathe. This was a solid tone. A banshee wail of invisible death. Every emergency light blinked red. My radio fizzled and popped. And down the hall, where the lead doors were welded shut in ‘79, came the sound of fingernails on steel.

They had opened something.

Or maybe...

Awakened something that was already here.

“Get away from the sigil!” I yelled, lunging forward. Too late. The chalk circle flared a sickly green. The girl’s head jerked back. Her mouth opened wide. And what came out of it was not a scream. It was more like a frequency. A tone.

Excerpt from Site-12

Security Incident Log – REDACTED

Date: ██/██/20██

Time: 02:13 AM

Location: Sublevel 3B, Containment Corridor E

Subject(s): \[REDACTED\] – Civilian trespassers / Ritual contamination event



Summary:

\> Unidentified anomalous vocalization triggered radiation surge across all monitoring stations. The gamma burst measured 13.6 Sv in under 0.3 seconds. Auto-containment doors failed to engage.

\> One civilian began levitating approximately 0.7 meters off the ground. The subject’s eyes were replaced with what appeared to be circular radiation burns.

\> Secondary subject began screaming mid-chant before collapsing into the floor tiles. Surface remains fused with organic matter, still emitting a low-frequency hum. Voice samples of the subject now circulate in the ventilation system, reciting something that sounds like reverse Latin during pressure drops. Security believes the subject is perhaps somehow attempting to finish a ritual through the ductwork.

\> Site declared unrecoverable. Remote observation only. The building does not contain the anomaly. The building IS the anomaly.

– Dr. Keene (last known transmission before neural collapse)

Journal Fragment: Recovered from Charred Backpack



\> Day... shit, I don’t know. The clocks are all broken, and my watch is counting backward now.

\> I saw Mike in the hallway. Or something that looked like Mike. He asked why I didn’t finish the chant. Said the atoms weren’t aligned, and I “broke the seal.” I asked what seal. He peeled off his jaw like a glove and screamed the word “TIME”! Immediately afterward, my nose began bleeding.

\> I think I’m part of the facility now. I hear it breathing when I sleep. I taste static. If anyone finds this, don’t speak. Don’t read the glyphs. Don’t hum. The frequency is contagious.

Back to Narrative:

When I came to, I was in the surveillance room. Alone. Or I thought I was. The monitors were all snow except one. Camera 9. The one trained on the hallway outside Containment Door Delta.

That's where I saw her. The girl. Still hovering. Still glowing. But it wasn’t the girl anymore. It was her shape, sure, but her mouth moved oddly, and her shadow pointed in the wrong direction. It kept twitching. Every time she opened her mouth, what looked like shadows spilled out. And behind her, in the deepest part of the frame...

Something was scratching on the other side of the screen. From the inside. The footage cut out. Not with a static flicker. Not with a power surge. It went dark the way a dying eye dims. I backed away from the screen just in time for the walls to breathe in. No, not a figure of speech. The walls inhaled. The drywall flexed inward.

I felt the pressure shift like the lungs of a buried god were pulling a breath through miles of concrete and malice. I ran. Or at least I thought I did. Every hallway turned into the same hallway. Every exit sign pointed inward. I passed what looked like my own shadow three times. Once, it waved. Oh God, am I going insane?

I finally ended up in the reactor chamber, though we hadn’t called it that in decades. It wasn’t a reactor anymore. Not really. The core had changed. No rods, no coolant tanks, just a hole. A hole that reflected nothing. Like someone had carved a pupil into the fabric of the universe and left it bleeding in the floor.

Floating above it was the girl, or what was left of her. Her body twitched in sync with the Geiger counter still screaming on my belt, moving to the rhythm of radiation itself. Her skin was fracturing like porcelain. Light was leaking out from the cracks. But it wasn’t really light, not like we know it.

And then I heard it...

\> WELCOME BACK.

My nose burst. My teeth rang. My thoughts scattered like rats in floodwater. Because that voice? It wasn’t from her. It wasn’t from the facility. It was like it was coming from somewhere... beyond.

They’d built this place to observe dark energy. To map decay. They found something older than time itself. Something that feeds on those who observe it.

I staggered forward. And just before I fell into the core, I saw what she was mouthing silently:

“We are inside it. We always were.”

"If you’re hearing this, I didn’t make it out. That’s fine. I don't think I was ever supposed to. But you, whoever finds this, don’t try to fix it. Don’t try to seal it. Burn the maps. Kill the frequencies. Forget the name of this place. And above all else…

Never listen when it hums your name.”
