Hi people, this is my first post on the subreddit but I've been a Lurker for a long time and I think I've found a good reason to post here because of recent event at the moment of posting. I'll make it a multiple part since I think I need to add details to make you people understand.

For context I'm the youngest in a family of four children. My siblings are in there mid 30s and I'm the only one still in his 20s. My siblings are composed of me (Charles but everyone say chuck), my sisters Jeanne (30) , Mary (32) and the oldest sibling in the group is my brother Stephen (36). Now that I've introduced my family you'll have a better context of who did what in the story.

Now my story can begin.

Like I said I'm in my mid 20 and I'm still trying to learn how to live as an adult since it's pretty new to me, I don't remember the show or movie I'm gonna quote but it's my first being an adult so mistakes are gonna be made along the way. I lived in a average suburban family in Quebec Canada. My parents weren't rich by any means but we always had toys to play with , food on our table and good education. Which I've learn to appreciate over time.

I never had deep issues with my family, pretty much the usual bantering about unimportant matter, but overall nothing dramatic. My brother was the first to move out from the nest, make sense since he's the oldest of the group. Fortunately for us he didn't move to another city or province. He managed to find a house close to where my parents live and kept his job as an aircraft technician, which he always dreamed about. He , unlike me, was sure of his decision in life and always look forward for challenges . My brother always took time to listen to me , my sisters and the rest of his entourage for advice and support. Despite all that, my brother never seemed to seek a companionship for which I mean a girlfriend. He lived alone in his empty house. The place , as beautiful as it is, did feel empty in a few places. Very small furniture and dish for the kitchen, a few trinkets here and there from his travels. The only room that felt worked on was his office which was more of a gaming room than anything else. He still find ways to receive guests like my sisters , my parents and the extended family. With all that going on for him I had a hard time understanding what happened in the last few weeks.

During the month of October this year (2024) he messaged me and told me he started to feel alone and anxious at times , mind you he never was the type to break under social pressure or feeling lonely. I was surprised at first and ask the usual of if he's alright and if he needed to talk. He accepted and I decided to walk to his house and order something for supper so we'd have more time to chat and do something else instead of being in the kitchen half of the evening . Once I arrived there he greeted me with a hug and a smile . We started the night by eating and do some small talk. As much as I like my brother we never had the same interest in pretty much everything. We like gaming but not the same types of games, he's very mathematics and I'm more on the artistic side of things . Never the less we knew how to cheer each other up until now. I'll paraphrase the conversation since it was in french so sorry if the message comes out weird.

Me : So , did you want to talk about the message you sent me earlier?

Steph: I mean yeah , I'm kinda glad you came and all but I don't want to feel like a burden for you all of a sudden.

Me : Never bud, I know I'm not at the same place in life but I love you and I want to help if I'm able to. What's going on?

The way he talked about what will follow felt like a case of seasonal depression. The sun is setting way more early and it rains a lot when it's day time. So lacking emotion and will to work didn't feel out of place.

Steph : it's been the first time I caught myself feeling tired and angry at small things y'know. My coworker feel invasive, completing a week of work doesn't feel rewarding and I get angry at mild inconvenience like undone dishes or not dressing up properly. 

Me: Steph (I always shorten his name) I just think it's the annual season for that . I get cranky like that at this time of year, does it make you that worry ?

Stephen took the time to think about my question and did seem to agree. We finished the night with a game of Mario party and I walked back home after that . That's the first time I witnessed doubt and worries on my brother's face . I shrugged It of at the time being when I probably shouldn't have.

That's day 1/part 1.
