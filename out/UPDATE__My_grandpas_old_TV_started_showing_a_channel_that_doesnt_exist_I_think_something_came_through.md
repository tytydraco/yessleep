Hey again.

So… this is an update to [my last post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/7XRfU7PozS) , the one about my grandpa’s TV and Channel 103. I wasn’t planning on writing anything else, but something happened last night, and I can’t sit with it anymore.

It’s followed me.

I know how that sounds. I know how crazy I sound. Believe me, I’ve tried every rational explanation. Sleep deprivation. Stress. Grief. Hallucination. I even went to a walk-in clinic yesterday because I thought I was having some kind of delayed breakdown.

But none of that explains what I saw last night.

I’ve been back at my apartment for five days. I haven’t turned on my TV at all. I even unplugged it. Honestly, I’ve been sleeping like shit, but otherwise just trying to act normal. The whole “if I ignore it, maybe it’ll go away” approach.

Last night around 3 AM — of course, 3 AM — I woke up to this faint humming noise. Like an old fridge or an electric razor just barely audible through the wall. At first I thought it was my upstairs neighbor (he’s always doing weird stuff at night), but when I sat up, I realized it was coming from inside my living room.

I didn’t even want to check. I just laid there for like 20 minutes trying to convince myself I was imagining it. But it kept getting louder. Like static rising under the floorboards.

Eventually, I grabbed a flashlight and walked out.

My TV was on.

Still unplugged.

Same static screen. Same channel number: 103 in the top right corner, glowing faint green.

But this time, the static didn’t last long. It flickered once — that weird blink again — and then it showed my apartment. Live. From the ceiling corner of the room.

Except this time, I wasn’t in the shot. The camera angle was looking down at my couch and the dark hallway behind it.

I should’ve left. I wanted to leave. But something about seeing my own apartment on screen rooted me in place.

Then something moved in the hallway.

On the screen, I mean.

Something tall, thin, dragging itself out from the dark like it was peeling off the wall.

Same figure as before. No eyes. Just that stretched-out mouth, too wide, like it was trying to smile and scream at the same time. It stopped behind the couch and just stood there. Watching.

And then — I swear to God — the image on the TV slowly panned, like the camera was turning.

Until it was pointing directly at where I was standing.

And I saw myself on screen.

But it wasn’t… quite me.

It looked like me, yeah, but the mouth was just slightly open. No expression. Blank stare. And something about the eyes — they weren’t mine. It was like someone wearing my skin but not knowing how to move it right.

It raised its hand.

And I felt something touch my back.

I screamed. Not proud of it. Just full-on panicked and fell backward into my coffee table. The second I hit the ground, the TV cut off.

Just dead black. Like it had never been on at all.

It hasn’t turned on since.

I threw a blanket over it and shoved it in the hall closet. I didn’t even care if the door didn’t close all the way. I just couldn’t look at it anymore.

I’ve been sitting in my kitchen since 4 AM with all the lights on. Haven’t slept.

I keep thinking about the last thing that voice said on the TV back at my grandpa’s:

“Now we are watching you.”

Not “I.” We.

There’s more than one of them. Whatever “they” are.

And they don’t need the TV to see me anymore.
