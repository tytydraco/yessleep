I'm going to write more things about my city, as you who read part 1 know, it is cursed by a witch who fulfills wishes in exchange for curses, at least that's what the old man told me. I asked him if there was any way to break the curse but he said he didn't know, he said I had to ask the witch herself who is already dead but her spirit still roams the city at night.

 So I continued my day normally until nightfall I told my mother that I was going to sleep at a friend's house to study for a school project and luckily she accepted so when the sun disappeared over the horizon I left the house and went after the damn witch.

People report that his spirit appears in various places, sometimes on top of buildings sometimes in dark alleys or in abandoned houses. maybe his spirit still hangs out there because it's his old home, old Joe told me the cabin is in the woods north of town so I walked over there.

When I reached the forest everything was silent the only sound was my sneakers stepping on the branches.

I went deeper and deeper into the forest when I saw something at the bottom, it was the old witch's hut. I approached calmly and saw the spirit, a shadow of a woman that almost camouflages itself in the darkness of the night.

I approached her calmly and said: ''Hello, are you the wishing witch?'' She turned to me and said quietly: ''What do you want?'' I replied:''tell me how to break the curse of town.'' She replied, ''The only way to break the curse is for the cursed one to die.'' She said that the cursed one was old Joe.

 cursed being that the one hit was joe. She explained several things, said that her curses have several levels depending on the wish that the person asks.

If the person asks for a lighter wish, the curse will only hit the cursed person but if the wish is something stronger like curing a serious illness like cancer, the curse will be stronger and will hit everything around the cursed person. she why is she helping me, she said that she suffers from her own curse and her spirit is also trapped in this city.

Well after all these questions and answers I waited for dawn to go back home I got home dead of sleep but I had to go to school I took my backpack and went to school. On the way back I stopped by Joe's house to tell him everything. Joe opened the door, I went into his house and told him everything.

So he said he was going to kill himself that sentence scared me I didn't think he was going to do that. I told him it could be the witch's lie but he didn't hesitate he told me to go away so I had no choice. I went back to my house wondering if I really should have told him that, that could very well have been a lie from the witch. I went home and continued my day. At night I decided to turn on my TV and I saw news of an old man named Joe who died of poisoning, He really killed himself and it was my fault. I went to sleep and woke up the next day to see if the curse was over I called the TV and, the cases of murders and suicides continue. Why did I trust that damn witch!

I feel guilty I made a poor old man kill himself.

I'll try to find more curse answers maybe I'll find them in the witch's hut I'll go there to see if I can find aything else. I'll update here if I find answers.

Hello, it's the next day and I'm going to write this text again. When I was returning from school I went to the witch's hut her spirit was no longer there I entered the hut and there were several things inside like the skulls of other animals, potions and a pentagram there was also an old wooden cabinet I opened and inside were several books books, I took them all and put them in my backpack and took them home. Now I am studying these books, they are written in a strange language.

I tried using the translator but it didn't work so right now I'm searching the Internet to see if I can find anything related to this mysterious language. 

I went back and unfortunately I didn't find anything in that language but something very strange happened. Today I was coming back from school there was a boy following me and it was Ryan, the smartest boy in the room I thought it was strange, when I turned around to ask him why he was following me jumped on top of me knocking me to the ground and tried to hang me while he was hanging me he said: ''give me back my books you little brat'' Luckily a person passing by helped me and took Ryan off of me.

After that Ryan ran off I thought it was very strange he said to return the books he was probably referring to the witch's books and the tone of his voice was not normal and like he was possessed so probably the witch's spirit knew that I I took her books and possessed Ryan to try to get them back. After that I was thinking that if the witch wants to, she can possess my father or mother to try to take the book from me or she can possess me so I can return the book to her. Well now I need to be suspicious of any of my friends or family because they may be possessed by that damn witch.

Anyway, I just wanted to write this report. I'll keep researching the language of the books. Probably the next report will be in part 3. Wish me luck to break this curse.
