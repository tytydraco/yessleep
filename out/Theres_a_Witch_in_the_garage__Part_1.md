Growing up, my dad never liked it when I tried to go into the garage. One of my earliest memories is of walking quietly past the living room and down the hallway toward the side door that led into the garage. I reached up and grabbed the handle but froze as my dad’s voice rang out from the other room:

 “Don’t go in the garage, buddy. There’s a witch in the garage.”

I was so young then that I didn’t question it. As I got older, I chalked it up to a harmless lie, a clever way to keep a curious child out of a space filled with tools, sharp metal, and chemicals. Dangerous things. Adult things. Still, I think about that moment a lot. How close I got to opening the door. And although his voice had its usual friendly tone, it sounded serious, he wasn't joking. 

The door had multiple locks on it. Three, if I remember right. That always struck me as strange. Why would a garage need that much security?

Maybe he was just being cautious.Or maybe, there really was a witch in the garage.

There was nothing strange about the garage, honestly. It looked like any other in the neighborhood. An overhead door faced the front yard, directly opposite to the overhead door was the pedestrian door that opened into the backyard. To the left of that was the big door that led into the house. Red and the only one that had deadbolts on, although it made sense, that was the doorway into the house. Inside the garage was my dad’s truck, more of a long-term project than something he actually drove. There was dusty, unused workout equipment pushed to one side, a cool ride on lawn mower equipped with little cupholders for when dad mows, scattered tools, and boxes stacked high with faded labels written in marker. It was the picture of a typical suburban garage: messy, functional, unremarkable.

Often, when we were outside playing or when my dad was out gardening, the overhead door would be wide open, letting in sunlight and exposing the garage to all the world. If there really was a witch in there, she never made a sound. And if she was watching, she never wanted to be seen.

I was an only child. Just me, my dad, and my mom at home. But the street we lived on was full of other kids. When I was ten, I remember playing hide and seek with a neighbor boy named Danny. He was about my age. It was my turn to count.

"Ready or not, here I come," I shouted, excited.

I sprinted around the front yard, laughing and looking under every bush and corner. I ran around the front deck and checked underneath. I peeked behind both of my parents’ parked cars, but there was no sign of him.

He must be in the backyard, I thought.

Instead of running all the way around, I dashed into the house to cut through. Just as I was about to head out the back door, I stopped. Through the window, I saw Danny. He was standing still, staring into the window of the pedestrian door at the rear of the garage.

The overhead door was shut. With no windows, the garage was almost pitch black inside. I got an idea. If I snuck in through the interior door, I could scare the crap out of him!

I crept toward the door. 

It was an imposing door, and I remember thinking how much it didn’t match the rest of the house. Our home was all red brick, every wall in the house was red brick, but for some reason the entry to the garage was framed with wood. The door itself was large, painted a deep, flat red, and a heavy deadbolt sat about two-thirds of the way up, much higher than any other lock in the house. Funny, I thought there were 2 locks, maybe 3. I swear just last week this thing had a deadbolt and a chain lock. 

Just as I reached for the deadbolt, my dad appeared.

He came from the opposite end of the house, moving quickly and directly, his expression sharp, it wasn't a coincidence, I was his target. He walked straight toward me and gave me a look that made me freeze.

"What are you doing?" he asked, his brow raised.

I told him what I saw, and explained my plan to sneak in and scare Danny. His face relaxed a little, and he smiled. With one hand on my shoulder, he gently turned me away from the door.

"That's a good plan, but you need to stay out of the garage," he said, smiling. "There’s a witch in the garage."

"Dad," I groaned, rolling my eyes. "I’m not a little kid anymore. Witches aren’t real."

His smile faded.

His eyebrows dropped slightly, and he tilted his head in that way adults do when they're about to be serious. His voice dropped.

"Sam," he said. "Stay out of the garage, okay buddy?"

He looked at me with disappointment and I didn’t understand why. I’d been in there a hundred times. Just last week, when he finished mowing the lawn, he let me drive the ride-on mower back inside. Nothing had happened.

But I nodded anyway.

He kissed the top of my head and told me to go outside and try to scare my friend.

When I got back out and ran around the fence, Danny was gone.

The rest of the day felt like a blur. I told my dad that Danny wasn't outside anymore, he was gone. My mom overheard and told my dad he should go check to make sure Danny got home safely.

“You know what his Mom did” She said with concern in her voice. 

He agreed and stepped out, but when he returned, he wasn’t alone. Two police officers came back with him.

My mom’s expression shifted immediately. She told me to stay inside and hurried out to meet them. I watched through the front window as she spoke with my dad and the officers, but they soon disappeared from view. I ran to the back of the house, curious, and looked toward the garage.

The pedestrian door, the same one with a window that Danny had been looking through, had a bright interior. The inside of the garage was clearly visible which means the overhead door was open. I could see my dad and the police standing inside, talking quietly. After a few minutes, Danny’s dad arrived. There was a tense pause, and then something changed. I saw them all start to laugh. Even from the back window, I could hear the sound of it. They were smiling now, joking with each other. 

My mom came back into the house a little while later. I asked her what was going on.

"I think Danny has an overactive imagination, dear," she said. Her voice was calmer, lighter, as if the worry had drained away.

I asked more questions, but she waved me off and went back to making dinner.

Eventually, my dad came inside. He stood by the front door for a moment, thanking the officers as they left. I didn’t wait.

"Dad, what happened? Where’s Danny?" I asked.

"Danny’s at home, buddy. He’s fine. Nothing to worry about," he said with that same reassuring tone he always used.

"But what about the police? And why were you in the garage?" Even at ten years old, I felt like I deserved more than that. I wasn’t a little kid. I could tell when something didn’t feel right.

"It’s okay, Sam. Just a silly misunderstanding."

From the kitchen, my mom called out before I could say anything else.

"Danny must have overheard your father talking about the witch in the garage," she said with an eye roll. "This serves you right." She shot a glance at my dad. "Maybe now you’ll stop with those silly stories."

"It’s not my fault there’s a witch in the garage!" Dad said, laughing loudly. Then he turned to me, his smile lingering just a moment too long. He gave me a wink.

"Or maybe it is.”

Life went on as normal for a while. Years slipped by, and I tried my best to believe we were just a happy, ordinary family. We had dinners together, watched TV, argued about homework and chores. If anything felt off I told myself it was just my imagination. All families had weird little quirks and for the most part my childhood was great but still the "witch in the garage" joke lingered. It was a throwaway line, something my dad still tossed out occasionally when he couldn't find a tool or when my Mom asked who left dishes in the sink.

“Probably the witch in the garage” My dad would say with a smirk. 

It was just a funny silly inside joke. But from time to time little things would happen that just wouldn't sit right. 

When I was 14 I came home from school to find my mom standing at the kitchen counter, squinting down at her glasses. She had a little butter knife in her hand, awkwardly twisting it at one of the tiny screws on the frame. As I dropped my backpack onto the dining table, I watched the knife slip and the screw ping off the counter.

“Ugh,” she sighed.

“Why aren’t you using a screwdriver?” I asked, smirking.

She didn’t look up. “We have the little kit somewhere, right?” I asked. 

“I don't know where it is” She replied.

“I do” I said. “It’s in the toolbox. In the garage.”

At that, she paused. Her eyes flicked up to mine. Something subtle shifted in her expression, just for a second.

“Unfortunatley” she said in a light voice. “There’s a witch in the garage.”

I gave her a long, flat stare.

“Seriously?” I said.

She gave a little laugh, like she regretted saying it but did not take it back.

I walked toward the hallway that led to the red side door. She called after me, her voice suddenly sharp.

“What are you doing?”

“I’m getting the screwdriver set,” I said. “I know where it is.”

“Let’s wait for your father,” she said. 

“Mom.” I stopped and turned. “There’s not a witch in the garage. Witches aren’t real. And I’m not five anymore. I’m not going to drink paint thinner or impale myself on a rake. I can handle going in there.”

I pulled the deadbolt across and turned the handle.

Nothing.

Still locked.

I jiggled the handle again, but it didn’t budge.

I turned around. Mom was standing at the end of the hallway, arms folded.

“Your father has the key,” she said. Her tone had changed. Still dry, but quieter now.

We returned to the kitchen. She asked about school. I told her about an annoying math quiz. It felt like we were both pretending nothing had happened, like we had slipped into some kind of performance. I wasn’t sure who we were trying to convince. Her or me.

Dad came home fifteen minutes later. He greeted us both like always, kissed Mom on the cheek, and dropped his keys on the hook by the door.

I told him about Mom’s glasses and the missing screw. “We need the screwdriver kit from the garage,” I added casually, watching him closely.

“Sure,” he said. “Let’s go get it.”

He said it with a smile, almost too easily.

I turned to head down the hallway.

But he didn’t follow.

I looked back and saw him unlocking the front door.

“Come on,” he said. “Let’s go this way. I need to grab something from the car anyway.”

He walked out into the fading afternoon light. I followed, confused. We circled around to the front-facing garage and he unlocked the overhead door. It rattled up and light spilled into the dusty space. The air smelled like oil and wood and something else, something metallic maybe. I stepped inside.

I made my way toward the old toolbox by the back wall. I knew where the screwdriver set was, bottom drawer, tucked beside a measuring tape and a clear container of old rusted nuts and bolts. I glanced over at the red door. Deadbolt. Chain. Keyhole.

A fortress. But why, don't most people just make do with a key. 

I grabbed the kit and turned around.

Dad was just standing there by the overhead door, looking in but not really at anything.

“Didn’t you say you had something to put in here?” I asked.

He blinked like I had pulled him out of a thought. “Oh, right. No. I’ll take care of that later. Come on, let’s go figure out dinner.”

We walked back inside. The garage door came down behind us with a heavy clang. We had a normal evening, more or less. Fixed Mom’s glasses. Ate spaghetti. Talked about my classes, his work, and the new neighbor’s. But something felt off.

Like everything was just a little too normal. Like they were trying to smother something unspoken with routine and small talk.

That night, as we finished washing the dishes, I offered to return the screwdriver kit.

“No, it’s okay,” Dad said, smiling. His smile lingered a little too long.

“I’ll take care of it.”

As we said goodnight that night, I felt the unease settle deeper in my chest. I knew that something was wrong but I didn't know what, maybe I didn't want to know. 

I hadn't seen Danny since the incident with the police when we were ten. His dad was a single father. They said Danny’s mom ran off when he was about two. The story was that she had gotten into drugs and fallen in with the wrong crowd. She was the complete opposite of Danny’s dad, who was a quiet, straight-laced computer engineer. He made good money, but eventually, he moved Danny and his siblings out of the area to live closer to their grandparents, who helped out with raising them. This was the kind of information my mom collected from her neighborhood grapevine and reported back to us over dinner as if she were some sort of local news anchor. 

After a long summer, it was finally time for high school. I was excited and nervous. More than anything, I was curious if Danny would be attending this Highschool, to my delight and slight unease he was. The last time we had spoken had been so strange, and we never got a chance to clear the air. I figured the best thing to do was just approach him directly.

"Hey man, been a while," I said as casually as I could manage.

“Sam,” Danny said with a grin. “How’s it going?”

The tension I had feared never came. We had a good, easy conversation. I introduced him to another friend of mine, Alex, who I’d gotten close with at the end of middle school. The three of us clicked immediately. We sat together at lunch every day that week, cracking jokes, throwing punches, calling each other names, the usual teenage nonsense. 

By Friday, we were practically inseparable. During lunch, we were deep in a conversation about our favorite horror films when Alex brought up our sleepover plans for the night. I had forgotten we were doing that.

"You should come, Danny," I said, excited.

Danny suddenly went quiet. Not just quiet—still. His usual energy seemed to drain out of him, leaving behind something uneasy.

Alex jumped in, trying to help. “It’s gonna be sick, man. We’ll stay up until four watching horror movies and grinding Call of Duty. You have to come.”

“It’s at your place, Sam?” Danny asked, voice low and hesitant.

“Yeah,” I said, not thinking anything of it. “Come on, man. It'll be fun.”

Danny agreed, but something in him didn’t bounce back. He stayed withdrawn for the rest of the day, answering questions with short phrases, his usual spark dulled.

At the end of school, Alex’s mom picked us up. Alex's mom was nice, she worked at the local hospital and worked a lot of nights so Alex used to stay over often. We introduced her to Danny and told her he’d be joining us. She did the typical mom thing, checking to make sure he had permission. Danny nodded and said his dad was fine with it. We made stops at Danny’s and Alex’s houses to pick up clothes, games, and snacks. Eventually, we arrived at my place.

As we walked through the front door, I suddenly realized I hadn’t actually told my mom that Danny would be coming. But as soon as she saw him, her face lit up.

“Oh my goodness, Danny!” she exclaimed, hurrying over. “Look at you! How’s your new place? How’s your dad? Are your siblings doing okay?”

Danny smiled politely and answered her questions. We all agreed on pizza for dinner and then piled into my room to get everything set up for the night.

Dad got home a little later, about halfway through one of the zombie films. He knocked on my door and I called out for him to come in. The door opened and he stood there with his usual big grin, until he saw Danny. His smile faltered. He kept smiling, but it changed. Something behind his eyes pulled away, like a curtain being yanked shut.

“Hey, Danny,” he said. “Great to see you. How are you?”

Danny, mid-bite into a slice of pizza, mumbled that he was good. He looked relaxed, more relaxed than he’d been all day.

“Well, I’ll leave you guys to it,” my dad said quickly, and then he immediately left the room.

“That was weird,” Alex said, glancing at me. Danny let out a little laugh, but it was tight and short.

“Yeah, your dad’s weird, man,” Danny added with a grin that didn’t quite meet his eyes.

“Wait until he mentions the witch in the garage,” Alex said with a snort.

Danny froze. His smile vanished. The room grew still.

I looked at him for a long moment. “What happened that day, Danny? When the police came?”

Alex looked confused but quieted down. He must have sensed something deeper in the air.

Danny looked down. “I really don’t want to talk about it,” he muttered.

I sighed. I didn’t want to push too hard, but the truth had been gnawing at me for years. “Please, Danny. My dad’s never going to tell me what happened. I need to know.”

Danny stayed quiet, eyes fixed on the floor and then over at the door that my Dad just closed. Then, finally, he nodded.

“Fine,” he said.

Relief hit me like a wave, though I tried not to show it. After all this time, I was finally going to understand.

“We were playing hide and seek,” Danny began, his voice flat. “We’d already used up all the good spots, so I went out back and crouched down behind the steps next to your garage. I thought I’d found a perfect place.”

He paused. The silence hung like fog.

“Then I heard something,” he continued. “At first, I thought it was just your dad, or maybe something from inside. But it was quiet, almost like a whisper. It was coming from the other side of the garage door. I couldn’t tell what it was saying, but then…”

He broke eye contact, his voice catching for a moment.

“Then it said my name.”

My skin prickled.

“A girl’s voice,” Danny added. “It said ‘Danny, help me.’ It sounded sick. Old. Like it was trying to pretend to be a girl but didn’t know how.”

I didn’t say anything. Neither did Alex.

“I ran. I just bolted. I went home and called the police. I didn’t know what else to do. My dad got really angry at me for calling 911, but I was terrified, I didn't know what to do. Then a couple of officers came and asked me questions. The next thing I knew, your dad showed up. I don't know what happened after that.”

He stopped talking.

The room stayed silent.

Then, Alex, doing what Alex always did, let out a nervous laugh. “Maybe there actually is a witch in the garage.”

I wish I could tell you we went into the garage that night, that we dared each other, lit flashlights, cracked the chain, faced the whispering dark. But we didn’t. None of us even had the courage to speak about it like it was an option. After Danny’s story, the room felt too still, like the air was heavier. We went back to our zombie movie and tried to laugh at things that weren’t funny. Eventually, we all fell asleep earlier than expected, like our bodies had given up on keeping up appearances.

Our friendship was never quite the same after that. Danny drifted away slowly, like a boat caught in an invisible current. He found new friends at school. People who hadn’t seen his hands shake that night. People who didn’t believe in voices behind garage doors. And just like that, it was back to me and Alex again, like before.

But something had changed in me.

That was when the nightmares started.

In one of them, I wasn't myself. I was my dad. I could feel it somehow, not just see it, but be him. I walked through the front door of the house and placed my keys on the hook near the entrance like it was just another day. Everything felt so normal, so painfully routine. But I kept moving, pulled through the dream like I was retracing steps I’d taken a thousand times. Down the hall. Into the kitchen. And then to the back window, the one that looked out toward the rear garage door.

Everything beyond the glass to the garage was black. Not nighttime dark, absolute black. The kind that swallows detail. But then... something shifted.

Just barely.

A silhouette began to emerge in the window of the garage's rear door. A human shape. Perfectly still. Like it had been standing there the whole time, waiting for me to notice, waiting for my vision to adjust to the light. It was impossible to make out the details, but I could tell it had long hair, and it stood just on the other side of the glass, where the dim reflection of the kitchen light couldn’t reach. The light caught on its eyes, though, or where the eyes should have been. Two small glints like beads in the dark. Tiny white droplets.

I raised a hand to wave. And the figure did the same. As if it had been waiting for me. Or mocking me.

Then it turned and disappeared into the black.

I woke up drenched in sweat. My sheets were twisted around me like I'd been trying to escape them. My heart was thudding like I'd just run a mile. I looked at the clock on my nightstand. 2:59 a.m. The red glow of the numbers bled softly into the rest of the room, and I stared at them until my eyes adjusted, waiting for the sense of panic to pass.

It didn’t.

Eventually, I let my head fall back against the pillow. My body was tired, but my mind refused to quiet. And just as sleep was starting to reclaim me, I heard a sound that yanked me back to full consciousness.

The click of the deadbolt on the garage door.

I froze.

For a moment, all I could do was listen, paralyzed. My heart pounded in my ears. That click hadn’t come from my imagination. I knew that sound. I've pulled that deadbolt before. 

I told myself it was nothing. Maybe the lock had settled on its own. Houses make sounds.

But that wasn’t my first thought.

My first thought was: the witch is getting out.

And I hated how real that fear felt.

How not ridiculous it was.

I got up out of bed without even thinking about it. I didn’t have a plan. My body just moved, as though something unseen had reached into my mind and wound it like a toy soldier. Slowly, with the cautious movements of someone half-aware they might be walking into a nightmare, I stepped toward my bedroom door.

I cracked it open and listened.

Silence. Darkness. Nothing. 

It was the kind of silence that hums in your ears, like it's holding its breath. Waiting for you to relax before making its presence known. 

I stepped out into the hallway. The floorboards beneath my feet creaked faintly in protest. I paused, holding my breath now too, as though even my lungs might betray me. I looked toward the far end of the hall, in the direction of the garage. That’s where the sound had come from. The click of the deadbolt. I knew it.

I also knew I wouldn’t check the door. Whatever courage I had evaporated the moment I pictured it. the handle slowly turning, the blackness pressing in against the frame like it wanted inside. I couldn't help but picture a witch. Her body and face pressed up against the other side of the garage door, waiting for me. Smiling. It was cartoonish and ridiculous. Witches are not real, I am not 5. 

Still some dark curiosity tugged at me, quieter than fear but more persistent. I drifted silently through the house toward the rear windows that looked out across the yard to the back of the garage. I pressed myself close to the glass and peered into the dark.

It looked exactly as it had in my dream.

The pedestrian door at the back of the garage stood still in the night, framed in shadows. The windows on it were black. Pure and all consuming. No light from the street reached back there, and no light from inside the garage leaked out.

It was void. An open mouth.

I squinted, trying to make out any shape beyond the glass, some subtle shift in the shadows. I willed my eyes to adapt, to peel back the darkness, to find something hidden.

But there was nothing.

Or, maybe, there was something I couldn’t see.

A cold impulse overtook me. I raised my hand and waved at the garage.

Just like my dad had in the dream.

I stood there waiting. Expecting nothing. Hoping, in some small desperate part of me, that nothing would happen.

And nothing did.

At first.

Then the red door inside the house opened.

My heart leapt into my throat. The faint metallic scrape of the deadbolt sliding back into place was unmistakable. A moment later, soft footsteps began to approach from the hallway. The same hallway I had just walked through.

I dropped into a crouch and darted to the dining room table, sliding under it as silently as I could. The wood was cold against my back. My breaths came fast and shallow. I pressed my hands over my mouth to quiet them.

Then I saw him.

Dad.

Just his legs, his old faded pajama pants and those worn slippers that never seemed to fit right. He walked slowly past the table, his movements unhurried, casual. Like a man getting up for a glass of water.

He stopped in the kitchen. I stayed completely still.

I heard the faucet turn. Water filled a glass.

He didn’t move right away. I imagined him standing at the sink, staring at the garage door just like I had. Maybe he saw something. Maybe he was waiting to see something move.

The silence stretched thin.

Finally, he turned and walked back down the hallway.

I waited. Thirty seconds. A full minute. Then another.

When I was sure I wouldn’t hear his footsteps again, I crawled out from under the table, careful not to make a sound. I crept back to my room, inching the door closed behind me with agonizing slowness.

I slipped under the covers and lay there, frozen.

There were no more noises. The house returned to its peaceful, almost artificial quiet, perfect for sleeping. But sleep had left this room long ago, and that night I knew that it would not be returning.
