It seems as if I’ve been away for a short while. I’ve needed to recover from certain injuries, but now I think it’s time to finally get back to everything that’s happened in the last few months.  

After I moved into a new apartment, everything became a blur. If I were doing jobs, I didn’t remember which ones were dreams and what I actually did. August often sent messages and seemed a bit worried about my mental state. As much as I wanted to go over and see him, I didn’t want Lucas to be exposed to how I was. So, I stayed away. Around that time, I stayed away from everyone, fearing I might cause them trouble.  

One afternoon, I woke up, body stiff in clothes I didn’t recognize. My phone wouldn't stop ringing, so clearly someone wanted my attention. When I fumbled for it, I winced from some slight burns on my fingertips on one hand, unaware of how I got them. Dirty clothing was scattered across the floor, which gave off an odd smell I couldn’t place.  

The voice on the other end was a stranger. Someone was requesting that I do a check-in of a forest. The offered pay was nice to me, so I accepted and rolled out of bed. My clothing was fairly clean, so I didn’t bother getting dressed. I just threw on my shoes and left for the job.  

I should have known something was up the moment this job didn’t come through The Corporation. My brain was in a fog around that time, and I didn’t have the mental energy to think beyond the next few seconds of each day.   

It was an old forest with deep, thick magic. Unlike most places of nature, this one stank of rot and decay. I didn’t hear any animals at all. There was something wrong with this place right down to its core. A barrier had been set up around it to keep normal people out. So why had I been called here? Dark moss hung from the trees. Even though it reeked of death, the place was dense with plant life. Mostly mushrooms, moss, and bare trees taken over by vines instead of leaves.  

I thought back to the phone call. Why did they ask me to do? A check-up? No, that was the previous job. This one I needed to do a cleanup. After walking a few feet between the trees, it finally clicked.  

This could easily be a trap. It would be easy to lure me into a dangerous situation if someone had my phone number. I was too dumb to double-check to see if it was a real job or not. I mentally kicked myself, trying to pretend as if I hadn’t been so easily fooled. There was still a small chance this was a legit request that needed my attention.  

Where I entered from had a tall wall of deep black cliffs nearby. Glancing over my shoulder, I realized I couldn’t see them through the trees. Pausing, I stopped and focused on a slight flow of magic in the ground, which was more like sludge than the normal glowing silver light it should be. When I took another step, the magic disappeared. No, it was suddenly a few miles away from me. It took a minute or so of looking to find it again. That meant that I was being moved in random directions every time I walked. There was a spell of some sort that made it look like I was walking in the direction I wanted instead of being tossed around the forest. It would be impossible to leave this place unless I broke the spell or figured out the logic behind the random movements. I wasn’t smart on my best days. It would never be able to backtrack, map out the entire forest to figure out which direction it took me.  

Sighing, I found myself too tired to be worried. That was until a set of eyes appeared through the moss.  

A body fell from the trees, landing on the soft ground. Then another. Soon, I was surrounded by the sounds of them falling to the ground, ready to charge at the person foolish enough to enter this place. The dark shape looked like it had been human at some point. The flesh turned black, clinging to bones and ripped open in spots to reveal it had been packed with moss instead of organs. White glowing eyes spotted some prey. The small dagger I brought along would not be good enough to take down so many of these creatures. Within seconds, I found myself outnumbered.  

I used the shifting forest to my advantage. Any time one of those things got close enough to touch me, I darted away and into a new spot. I almost ended up bumping into a few of them in my mad dash to get away. Soon, all the movement made my stomach roll. I could not keep this up. My head felt like it was going to explode from fear and the constant tainted magic flowing through the air.  

Through the trees, I spotted a clearing. I decided to take a risk. It was too far away to run toward before I would be moved elsewhere. So, I gathered up some of that sickening magic to give my legs enough power to make one large jump. It hurt, but was worth it. I rolled into a clearing by those tall dark cliffs, but I wasn’t near the exit. If I followed the cliffs, I might be able to find a way out. And since I was out of the trees, the movement spell didn’t activate. I was free to walk in any direction I wanted. That didn’t solve my main problem of those dark mossy creatures from pouring out of the trees. I needed to make a stand here.  

The dagger came down into the first one's skull, easily killing it. I was shocked by how fast it went down. A well-placed kick was enough to push them back or even take off parts of their frail bodies. For a few seconds, it looked like I would be able to deal with this. Of course, that wasn’t my luck.  

The first body started to twitch again as the dark magic pooled back into it. It stood up with jerky, unnatural movements. The creature was fighting against whatever force wanted it to fight. This small army would stop at nothing to make me a part of it.  

I couldn’t just keep killing them or breaking their bodies. Another would take its place, and there was a bottomless pit of tainted magic to make them get back up. I put away my weapon and stood with my hands ready. When the next creature attacked, it ripped into my clothing, but I placed a hand on its flesh and cut off the spell that kept it moving before it did too much damage. When it fell to the ground, it stayed there. Without the tainted magic source to keep the flesh intact, the creature crumbled away into dust.  

For a split second, the rest of them paused at the sight. Then a sea of them came rushing in. Most weren’t strong enough to do much more than get a few scratches and bites in before I killed them for good. I had a way to kill them, but that didn’t mean I was able to win. There were too damn many of them. And with each attack, I needed to fight against that dark magic seeping into my body, trying to take over. It was like riding a bike, eating a sandwich, and getting mauled by a rabid dog all at the same time. It took everything I had to stay focused and to push aside any fear and pain.  

I didn’t know how long it took. Somehow, I made a clear enough pathway to start my escape. I just needed to outrun these creatures and follow the cliffs to leave. Based on how many of these things lurked inside the forest, there was a good chance they could break through the barrier that kept this place hidden away. I still had some hope that this was a real job, and I would be paid for all this effort.  

Just as I started to flee, a weak hand fell on my arm. I could have shrugged it off, but something in those glowing eyes made me stop. The dry mouth was trying to form a word. Once I realized what it was, a coldness spread through my veins.   

‘Please. ’  

It wanted to die.   

All these creatures did. Deep down somewhere, they were aware of the state their bodies were in. Did they feel the pain of their flesh rotting? Of the undead bones moving against the moss that had grown inside them? I could have left. And yet...  

I turned back toward the crowd, body in pain and exhausted. Standing ready, I waited for them to come to me so I could put as many as possible out of their misery. I would not be able to save all of them. I might even die trying to do this. Deep down, I knew how stupid staying here was. Knowing all that, I could not forgive myself if I left.  

How many did I put down? I had no idea. The scratches and cuts healed, but I was at my limit. Literally backed against a wall. Sweat dripped down my face, stinging my eyes. I gasped for air, feeling the dark magic tainting parts of my body without the energy left to fight it. I hadn’t told anyone I was here. There was no chance of a last-second rescue. This was it. And oddly enough, I felt a small hint of relief. I had done something useful. After everything, I could finally rest, right? The fate before me wasn’t as bad as how I’d been living so far.  

The moment before I accepted my death and the tainted magic to finish the job, the last-second rescue did arrive; however, it was from someone I never expected.  

A tall woman jumped down from the dark cliffs, gracefully landing in front of me and, within the blink of an eye, took out the last swarm of creatures with one strike of a long sword. Before I finished registering what had happened, she had already put the weapon back and was looking over her shoulder in my direction.  

She wore a large fur coat with a collar of animal heads. The coat made it clear she was from a heavy-hitting Hunter family. They often made jackets from supernatural creatures that were almost on the same level of protection as Agent’s suit jackets or the Mailman uniforms.  

We had never met before, but I knew her face. I almost sank to the ground, and all strength drained from my limbs as a pit formed in my chest.  

“Mom...” I knew it wasn’t her, and yet the word still slipped from my mouth.  

I had handled her ashes. She was gone. And somehow the person in front of me had the same face with minor differences. Tears came to my eyes, and I forced back. This woman looked older than my mother. As much as it hurt, it also made me happy to see. I always wanted to know what my only parent would look like if she had the chance to age.  

“Wit...? No, just similar.” She spoke mostly to herself and turned away.  

If she looked so much like my mother, it meant they were related. That almost meant I was next to a Hunter from a very scary family that she had run away from. Her voice had been the one on the phone that got me here. She most likely wanted to tie up loose ends or drag me back, kicking and screaming, to their family to reclaim abilities within my bloodline. I knew all that. But her one statement made me ignore everything. All the pain and weariness disappeared. All I wanted to know was a single thing.  

“Wit? Wait, was that my father?”  

I pestered and got very close to her. She was taller than me and taken aback by my question. If she dropped the name, that meant I looked like that person. My mother had always said she had a one-night stand, but she didn’t tell me about the whole being related to a Hunter family. I didn’t blame her for hiding certain things.  

She took a step back with mixed emotions on her face. She didn’t think our meeting would have gone like this. With a sigh, she looked away and off into the forest in case more of those creatures appeared.  

“There was a tradition on your father’s side to name their children after what the parents hoped they would become or gain in life. Clearly, you inherited your father’s intelligence.” She said those words as an insult.  

I should have been upset over the remark, but it was hard to hate someone who sounded and looked like a person I missed so much.  

“Did you call me here to kidnap me or something?” I asked her.  

I wanted to try to pry more information about my parents out of her. It was a wiser choice to see if she wanted me dead first or not.  

“Why would you assume that?” She replied almost as a test.  

“Because of what powers I have. Clearly, my eyesight and other things are valuable to a Hunter family. I doubt you all are happy that my mother left and wants to get these abilities back.” I shrugged.  

She studied me for a long few minutes, bright blue eyes hidden behind strands of long red hair.   

“Do you think your mother could have left on her own with all her health problems?” She answered quietly as if admitting a sin.  

Those words hit me like a ton of bricks. She had been sickly when she was pregnant and almost died. It was a miracle I was even born. How did she get away from a family of Hunters back then? She could only have if someone helped her get away or if she wasn’t wanted.  

“Do you know where your eyesight even comes from?” She questioned a stern tone coming back to her voice.  

I shrugged again. Aberline might have mentioned it, but I was too tired to remember. She let out a long sigh, realizing she would need to explain a lot of things to a clueless person next to her.  

“Most are in agreement that it was passed down from a son of a Silver King. The Hunter families captured him to gain whatever they could. His bloodline was far too valuable to go to waste. Our goal is to eliminate every supernatural creature out there, even if that means becoming monsters ourselves. Those eyes were far too useful to keep to one family, you understand that much, right?”  

I nodded, feeling sick. I didn’t want to think about what she was implying for too long. But if he was passed around to each family, then how come I haven’t heard of the Hunters with the same kind of eyesight I held?  

“Every single Hunter in the top families possesses the same eyes you do. However, we cannot use them. The eyesight is only activated by a simple condition.” She paused, hand on her sword, blue eyes appearing so dark it scared me. “I called you here because I heard rumors that you may be part of our family. We cannot have a Dougherty running around causing trouble. You can use the eyes. Watching this fight has made that perfectly clear to me. You could have left, and yet you stayed, but not out of bloodlust.”  

Her voice bore down on my shoulders so intensely that I wanted to back away. I stood my ground, knowing I needed to face her to get some answers.  

“What is the simple condition to be able to have this eyesight?” I asked her somehow with a clear voice.  

“Love.” She said and let her hand drop from the handle of her sword. “You must hold love for supernatural creatures. Despite our families having these eyes, we cannot use them. If we are able to use them, we are no longer Hunters. I have confirmed you are not a Dougherty and you are not a Hunter.”  

An odd feeling washed over me. This solved some of my problems. If a member of the family publicly states I wasn’t one of them then maybe I might gain some trust back. I didn’t blame most of the Agents I worked with for how they avoided me recently. They had been hurt too much by that family. I still had a desirable trait that I might be hunted down and sold for, but at least I might have a bit more support from The Corporation.   

“Look at your clothing. What a disgrace. It’s an insult that anyone thought you might be one of us. Here.”  

Under her large coat, she pulled out a bundle of clothing and threw it into my face. I held it in front of me to look it over. It was a brown light winter jacket with a fur-lined hood. It appeared modern, but I knew it had been made with parts of a creature. This was a Hunter’s jacket. Not a very strong one. For a second, I didn’t want to put it on, considering what went into making it. But if I didn’t wear it, would that be an insult to the creature that died to make it?  

Carefully, I slipped my arms into the sleeves, finding it fit perfectly. I felt something stir within the fabric. Magic with emotions started to get riled up. If the creature that went into this didn’t like me, it could lash out. I might die just from putting on a jacket. Some tense moments passed as we mentally studied each other. I couldn’t tell what this had been before. The fur was soft and a very charming color, brown with white mixed in. It was well-made and better than any jacket I ever owned. Beyond that, it just looked nice and oddly suited me. The jacket agreed. With some luck, we were on the same wavelength and liked each other. The emotions died, and I didn’t sense them anymore. The jacket didn’t exactly have a personality. No real thoughts to itself. But it had enough to agree or disagree with who would be wearing it.  

“It was made for your mother. It would be a waste to rip it apart to remake it for a new person.” She explained, turning away again.   

“Thank you, Auntie Robyn.” I told her, smiling at the new gift.  

I saw her shoulders tense under her coat as her head slowly turned in my direction, eyes wide and face pale. It must have hurt her hearing those words from her dead sister’s child, but she was mostly concerned about how I knew her name.  

“Did... Faith tell you about me...?” She asked, her voice cracking a little.  

“No. She didn’t tell me anything about her side of the family. But I’ll tell you a secret. Richmond is my middle name.” I said to her.  

I’ve changed my name legally too many times to count. But I’ve always kept my middle name because it was what I go by. And regardless of what my first name might be on paper to keep the wrong people away, I’ll always remember what my true first name is.  

“My mother named me Robin.” I explained to her.  

Her eyes looked wet for a moment, but to her credit, she didn’t turn away again.  

“What a stupid girl she was. Wasting her only chance at naming a child...” She said with a voice full of regret.  

My mother wanted me to be strong and to be able to take care of myself. She hoped I would gain all the positive traits of the sister she loved by passing down her name.   

“What was my father like?” I suddenly asked, ruining the moment.  

Robyn’s defenses were down, so I thought I might get some answers. With another sigh, she shook her head.  

“Like you. You even look the same. Stupid and kind to a fault. He followed his heart instead of his brain, and it killed him.” She stopped hinting that I may not want to know his fate. It was a kindness I wasn’t expecting from her. When I nodded, she kept speaking. “He was a mule. His mother is a forest witch who specializes in poisons. This is still alive somewhere. His father was a cupid who was killed by an ex-lover. He was our groundskeeper regardless of his bloodline. He was human and therefore accepted enough to hire.”  

I crossed my arms, confused. Witches aren’t considered supernatural creatures even if they can use magic. Cupids were similar to succubus. They were very good-looking people, but didn’t drain humans of their life when they made contact. If I had so much magic mixed into my family, then how was I so human? I could understand two drastic bloodlines canceling out my father’s abilities.   

Robyn could almost hear my thought process. Her face fell when she fully understood how little I knew, then a slight expression of horror came over her face as she wondered how I’d lived for this long.  

“You do understand the difference between humans and supernatural creatures, right...?” She asked, praying I did.  

“Well... humans can’t use magic...” I started feeling stressed.  

“Witches. Hunters.” She said bluntly.  

I froze, letting the full weight of how far behind I was sink in. Everything had an internal magic course. Some creatures didn’t think humans did simply because of how little they held. Even if it was a fraction of an ounce compared to creatures, it was still there. Some Hunters barely have any internal magic, and yet they can use it. No matter how much I thought this over, I was confused.  

“Supernatural creatures produce magic, humans do not.”  

Her words made it all click. We could both absorb magic from the world around us, but I have never created any. It felt odd that there was only one thing that separated monsters and humans. I’ve known supernatural creatures kinder than most humans. And yet I’ve faced monsters that went beyond human understanding.  

Regardless of the confusing fact that what separated us was so minor it didn’t change the fact that I was considered fully human despite all the inhuman abilities I had.  

“I wish I could thank my father for making me this smart.” I said with my arms crossed.  

“Both of your parents were dumb as bricks. You had no chance.” Robyn said, completely serious.   

Considering what she’s seen of me so far, I didn’t blame her for that opinion.   

“What happened to him?” I pressed on, fully aware it would most likely not be a pleasant story.  

“You did.” She said calmly. “My sister did not have the skills expected of her. I’ve heard she was able to do Contract Work after you were born, but Faith was not as strong as she needed to be. Therefore, she was meant to keep our bloodline going. Once she was twenty, she had a husband lined up. But she fell for Wit before then. I suppose they weren’t as dumb as I give them credit for. They were aware that if they got rid of the child, she would only get a slap on the wrist. Wit would be sent away, worked to death, but alive. They were aware that our brother loved Faith. He's powerful but has a soft heart. If he begged our grandfather, he could talk him into just sending her away. Without our medical care, most assumed she would not survive the birth.”  

An odd prickling feeling rose through and settled around my neck as if a set of hands were resting on my throat. My father could have lived, and my mother would have as well if they had made a choice not to have me. They were both dead because they refused.  

“There was a slim chance that she would have lived and had you. And that’s what happened. As a punishment, Wit was killed. Faith needed to watch as we took him apart. He was a mule that could not produce magic. His body parts were still useful. So, we took every single piece. He was awake for as long as possible. I expected him to curse and scream, to beg for his life. Instead, he only said one thing after parts had been taken and just before his death. ‘Please be happy, both of you’ “  

I wondered if Robyn hated me. I took her sister away. Just being here killed two people. And all they ever asked in return was for me to live a good life. Right now, I haven’t been able to do that. It felt like I had been doomed from the start. How could anyone be happy dealing with such a heavy burden of love?  

“You look awful.” She commented after I didn’t respond to what I just heard.  

“I’ve... had a rough few years.” I admitted.  

“Go get a partner or something and cheer up.” She scoffed, arms crossed.  

“They died.” I said, not looking up at her.  

Her hand shot out and grabbed my arm so tightly I thought it might snap.   

“My sister did not give up her life for you to mope around like this! People we love die! It's our job to keep living and honor them! Eat good food, have time for yourself, and do things you enjoy. You can mourn them, but you can’t make it your entire personality! Now hurry up and take care of the rest of this mess, and then call someone you care about!”  

She tossed me aside to face the new crowd of creatures spilling out of the forest. I was mentally drained, in pain, and could not handle this hoard on my own.  

“Are you going to-” I started looking over my shoulder.  

Robyn had her arms crossed, tapping a heeled foot in annoyance. I would get no help from her. I needed to grit my teeth and power through this to be able to get the hell out of this place and into a warm bed.   

The new jacket was a massive help. It gave enough protection from any minor injuries. It didn’t like the tainted magic, so it refused to defend me from that. Overall, the second battle wasn’t as bad as the first. I could barely still stand afterwards, though.  

There were still some of those monsters out in the woods. I could never kill all of them. At least I made a dent in the numbers, and there was no longer a risk of them overflowing outside the forest.   

Robyn led the way as I dragged my feet behind, barely able to keep my eyes open.   

“Are we ever going to see each other again?” I asked her as we got closer to the exit.  

“No.” She said sternly.  

“But Auntie Robyn...” I said, trying to sound pathetic.   

She froze on the spot, tense, holding back something.   

“Don’t call me that.” She hissed.  

“I have your number. You called me for this job, remember? After I’m doing better, we’ll see each other again.”  

She wanted to disagree but didn’t say so. There was a chance that she would go along with meeting once more. She missed my mother just as much as I did. I might only have a little bit of her left in me, at least it was something.  

When we reached the other side, my phone started to go off. I checked it to see countless missed messages from August, Evie, and April. That was strange. Something had to have happened while I was gone. Robyn saw my expression and offered to drop me off somewhere, and I accepted.  

She brought me to Evie’s place, and I was tempted to hug her. That may have been going too far, though. She left just in time for the door to fly open and for Evie to scoop me up.  

“Where have you been? We were so worried!” She said, looking as if she hadn’t slept at all.  

“I was doing a job. What happened?” I asked as I walked inside.  

“Don’t freak out, but there was a fire at August's place.” She said, and I froze.  

My first thought was Lucas, who thankfully came rushing out, latching onto my leg. He was too tired to even cry. I scooped him up to hold tight, my heart hurting over how distraught he looked. August showed up next and held us both in a tight hug, refusing to let go. I didn’t understand why they were all worried about me when something like this happened.  

“The damage is minor. The kitchen and downstairs are trashed. I was out, but his aunt and Uncle were home. They’re in the hospital but will be fine. I couldn’t save the little jumping spider, though...” August explained in a low whisper.   

He hadn’t pulled away to let Lucas relax a little. For whatever reason, the small boy refused to be set down or wanted to be away from me.  

“Oh, I saved the spider.” April commented.  

“You’re a hero.” August commented in a sour voice that his sister didn’t notice.  

Soon Lucas fell into an uneasy sleep. My arms were tired, but I refused to let him go. I rested my cheek gently against the top of his head. August did the same with mine, his arms carefully holding us not to squish his small, tired son. It felt odd having his hands resting on my back. I wasn’t sure how to feel about being so close to another person after everything that had happened in the past few months.   

“I can’t imagine how you feel right now. First, you lost your family when your village was attacked, and now this could have taken away Lucas.” I commented to August, careful not to wake the sleeping boy in my arms.  

I felt him squeeze a little tighter, aware enough not to squish Lucas as he did so.  

“What are you talking about? I didn’t lose any family back then. All my family members are right here...” He whispered with a hint of pride in his voice.  

The tone was gentle and soft, and he was holding us in such a caring way. Yet, the back of my neck prickled. Something I had never considered came to mind.  

His mother and father had already passed away when the village was attacked. They may have used April to change his mind about defending their village instead of moving. If they did so, then that power would bring a war down on their heads. August was the strongest member of the village, so why wasn’t he there on that day it was wiped out? If they were aware a threat was coming, why would he ever leave them undefended? And did the ones who attacked know he would be gone ahead of time?  

Now that I thought of it, it was odd that only August and April were collared. Wouldn’t they grab a few more of his village to sell? And could he have killed the ones who threatened him that day? Yes, but maybe not while defending his sister.  

August was the type of person who would do anything for his family to keep them safe. He turned into a monster and created a set of dolls from Lucas’s aunt and uncle so they could all remain together. It wasn’t too far-fetched that he would have made a deal to keep his sister alive. Collar or not, they would live, and the ones threatening her wouldn’t.   

I cared about him. I knew these actions came from a place of love. And he still scared me.    

I doubted April had put any of this together. I prayed she never did. Finally, he pulled away, taking Lucas to tuck him into bed.  

“Why were you guys worried about me?” I asked after April was finished, hugging me.   

She complained about how I smelled and suffered through the attention, though.  

“Well, we thought you might have been inside the house when the fire started...” Evie explained.  

I was still confused. I hadn’t been by their place in ages. So why did they think I was there?  

“Lucas woke up and went downstairs. He said he saw someone who looked like you in the kitchen, and that’s where the fire started. We haven’t been able to go inside yet to double-check. When you weren’t answering your phone and no one knew where you were...” She trailed off.  

My fingers twitched as I remembered the odd smell in my new apartment. I'd woken up with burns on them. Now that I was thinking clearly, I could place the smell as being gasoline.  

I slowly found a chair to sit down. I wasn’t aware that April and Evie were speaking to me for a few seconds. My mouth was too dry to speak. No matter how hard I tried, I could not remember what I did the day before. I saw Dr. Fillow recently, but nothing came when I tried to think of our conversation.  

“There’s something wrong with me... I might have...” I started mostly speaking to myself.  

August came out of the side room and then kneeled so we could make eye contact. He carefully brushed some loose strands behind my ears, a dimpled smile on his face.  

“You're going through a lot right now. Instead of relaxing, you’re pushing yourself to keep working. Lucas said he saw someone who looked like you, not that he saw you, right? You would never do anything to hurt him, no matter what was wrong with you. Honestly, do you really think you would be sitting here right now if I thought you had anything to do with the fire?”  

Yeah, August scared the hell out of me. But he was right. He wouldn’t let me inside this house if he thought I was the cause of the fire. Either the burns and clothing were from a different job, or what? Someone was trying to blame me for all this? I did have enough enemies, but why drag August into this?  

A dizzy spell came over my head. In a blur, August helped me to the couch. I faded out for a short while. He forced some water into my hand and something to eat. I must have fallen asleep for a few minutes. When I sat up, I was covered by a blanket, and the living room was empty. The food helped clear up my brain.   

“How long was I out for?” I asked August if he had come into the room to check on me.  

“About half an hour. Go back to sleep.” He ordered.  

“Where are the girls?” I asked and stood up, stomach dropping.  

“They went out for food. Why?” He asked, catching on that something was wrong.  

“I’m going to find them. Stay here with Lucas. I think someone is targeting people I care about. “  

I refused to explain more as I rushed out the door. It made no sense why someone would pretend to be me and set August’s house on fire unless they wanted to hurt one of us. I just prayed I was wrong.  

At least the girls walked instead of taking Evie’s car. April didn’t like riding in them. It was dark outside; however, normally, April could handle any creeps that might bother them. I raced down the empty streets looking for them. The eyesight made it easy.  

What I saw made my blood run cold, and I ran harder toward them. At first, I assumed the worst. April saw me and, for a second, raised her hands as claws ready to attack. Soon, she let them drop so I could drop down next to Evie and look her over. A deep cut poured blood over his face. It wasn’t as bad as it looked. She pressed a sleeve over the cut, trying to wipe away the blood blinding her left eye. This would leave a scar. I nearly felt sick. Evie enjoyed dressing up more than anything. She was proud of her looks but not in an overly vain way.  

“He looked like you but...” April said, sounding sorry this happened.  

“This just happened, right? Did you see which way they went?” I asked the girls.  

They shook their heads.   

“It was weird. Normally, I can tell if someone uses a door, but he was just gone. The rain smell doesn’t help.” April said, holding her friend.   

It had just rained, filling the air with a dampness. I didn’t blame April for having issues trying to pin down different smells at the moment.   

“Let’s get you two home. Then I need to check on a few other people.” I said and helped Evie back to her feet.  

I refused to let her go the entire way back, no matter how much she fussed. August took over treating her small wound, then called after me when I rushed back out the door.  

First, I called Cameron asking where she was and if anything odd had happened recently. She was currently seeing an Agent, so she was safe. I promised that I would call her again soon.   

Next was Harp. When she didn’t answer her phone, I hurried over to her place. She might just not want to talk to me. I needed to make certain. She lived in a closed-down gym. I hadn’t been here for a while. The lights were off, but the doors were unlocked. When you were a tough supernatural creature, why bother locking your doors?   

Without wasting any time, I ran down the hallway to the large open gym area where she normally slept. The lights were off. Fumbling with the switch, I turned them on, heart sinking, seeing the chaos of the room. Harp wasn’t the cleanest person, but she would not leave her equipment overturned. Spots of blood were scattered around, leading to a body on the ground.   

“Harp!” I yelled out to her.  

I knew she wasn’t dead, but it didn’t make me feel much better. She sat up, her eyes landing on me. Her fist raised, then came down hard. I barely dodged the attack, then she paused, looking over my face harder.  

“Oh, you’re the real one.” She said and stood up.  

A slash was across her stomach, but the wound had almost healed already.  

“Someone who looked like you attacked me. I could have taken them, but I was knocked out with some sort of sound attack. They must have known my weakness...” She crossed her arms, a bit angry at herself.  

Glancing at the clock, she nodded.  

“Looks like that happened ten minutes ago. I guess the fake won’t be around. Hey, can we-”  

She wanted to talk about how things were between us. I was looking around, trying to find clues on who may be behind this. My eyes caught some shattered mirror shards. Was all of this blood Harp’s? Did she get an attack in? Suddenly, I could see a hint of magic outside. Someone else was here.   

“Hold that thought!” I said and ran out of the room, positive she would be alright.  

If they wanted to kill any of the people they attacked, they could have. This was some sort of sick warning. I didn’t understand the reason, so the attacker showed up to spell it out for me.  

The person waiting outside did look like me. I understood how people made the mistake. He looked less worn out than I did at the moment.   

“Why are you doing this?” I demanded.   

I wasn’t certain what powers they held. If they tried to attack them, they might get away without any answers.  

“Oh? You don’t know?” He asked in a voice like my own, only with a hint of cruelty.   

“Who are you?” I said Exhausted.  

That was the wrong question. The face fell into an expression of utter hatred. They started muttering, the face starting to shift into someone else. Soon, I was looking at August instead of a copy of myself.   

“You left me. And now have the nerve to ask that kind of question?!” A deep voice that didn’t suit August came from them. “You deserve this. All of this after breaking your promise! These attacks were a warning. The next time I appear, I’ll kill everyone you love and bring every single one of your sins down on your head! The only way out of this is to kill yourself. I don’t care how you do it. Get it done. You have three days.”  

With a single step, they backed up and disappeared into a puddle behind them, leaving my head swimming with questions.   

My chest felt so heavy I could barely breathe. I realized how tired I was. I could fight and look for answers, but why bother? Wouldn’t everyone else be better off if I were gone? My legs gave out, and I sank to the ground.  

Three days. Maybe that option wasn’t too bad. I could get my affairs in order in three days. Closing my eyes, I felt a dampness seep into my dirty pants as I heavily considered the paths before me, then decided on taking the easiest option for once.
