It was their turn to close the caf√© tonight. They did not mind, but it was something they normally did not do. And to be honest it got kind of...creepy around here at night. Plus, with the rumor about a kidnapper being active did not make them feel any better. Making sure everything was locked up they kept their keys in hand, making the walk to their car. 
 
 

 
Keeping focused on getting to their destination, they unfortunately did not hear the quick steps of an individual who was hiding close by. Soon their vision had gone dark and the last thing they saw was a figure dressed in crimson. 
 
 

 
In their unconscious state they could hear muffled talking around them. Just where were they? In their foggy mind they went over the events that had just occurred. 
 
 

 
They closed up the cafe. 
 

 
 
Started the walk to their car. 
 
 

 
Then their vision faded after the light footsteps which came up behind them so unexpectedly, and crimson being the last thing they saw. 
 
 

 
Moving their arms, and then their legs, they realized that they must be suspended in the air as all that touched the ground was their tiptoes. Tugging their arms above themselves they were able to feel the chain which they were bound by. 
 
 
 
 
"Now...now I wouldn't try to struggle so much" a gruff voice made itself known close to them. 
 
 
 
 
"Why am I here?!" they yelled, trying to kick out their legs. 
 
 
 
 
The owner of the voice sighed clearly annoyed "You must be aware by now who I am". 
 
 

 
'That's right the rumor about the kidnapper' they thought to themselves the police had named him...something strange due to the description of the bodies when found. 
 
 

 
"The Eye Collector" 
 
 

 
"Hahaha...ah yes that weird name they gave me. Though they are not entirely wrong" the man continued to chuckle picking something up causing it to clink against metal. 
 
 

 
Their heart began to thump loudly in their ears "W-why would you want my eyes? They are nothing special" a whine escaped them. 
 
 

 
 
"Why? Tsk my darling it has nothing to do with color at all. "Sometimes clients want 'unique' eyes, those who can see things others can't." He used the tip of the blade to lift their chin upwards looking at his captive's blindfolded face. 
 
 

 
Seeing things that others can't? 
 
 

 
Could they pass on that trait if their eyes were removed and surgically put i to someone else or would some sickos have them in a jar on display for everyone to see. 
 
 

 
Grinding their teeth together they made a mistake by jerking away their head only to have the man grab them by the back of the hair forcing their head upwards. 
 

 
 
"I like how feisty you are, but it will not do you or me any good if I damage the product before the sale" 
 
 

 
Their bottom lip trembled as they fought back a sob. 
 
 

 
"Oh, shh it will be over soon darling" he hushed them by placing the blade against their lips, and slowly slid it up the side of their face cutting away the blindfold. 
 
 

 
Looking up they saw a man in a crimson suit. His skin had been kissed by the sun, and eyes a mismatch of pale white and gold. A jagged scar went across the pale white eye. 
 
 
 

Was he blind in that eye? 
 
 

 
Turning the blade around in his hand he pressed right under one of their eyes. 
 
 

 
"You might feel a slight STINGING sensation!" he chuckled before he began the gruesome task of carving out their eyes one by one and plopping them into a jar full of liquid on the medical tray nearby as their screams soon faded and they passed out from blood loss. 
 
 

 
The man cleaned his hands and his tools of extraction picking up a burner phone and making a call. 

 

 
"It's ready if you want to meet up. And I assure you that our 'candy' is nothing but the best" a grin formed on his lips looking at the motionless, dangling form of his new victim then to the jar he held in his other hand a pair of forest green eyes.
