The problem started a year after my sister, Emma, disappeared. No one knew what happened to her. She was out in the woods, hiking along the trail near our family’s cabin, when she vanished without a trace. The police searched for days, but all they found was her backpack, half-buried beneath a pile of leaves. They called it an accident, maybe a wild animal, the police eventually chalked it up to coyotes.

My grandmother on the other hand, swore up and down the creature in the woods took her. Back when I was a kid that would have rattled me, but as an adult I only found it inappropriate.

I drove out there alone one crisp autumn evening, hoping to find some remembrance of her. The cabin sat in the heart of the forest, isolated, just as it had been when we were kids. It was a place of comfort, but now it felt frozen in time.

That night, I sat outside by the fire, the crackling flames offering some semblance of warmth as the sun sank beneath the horizon. As the night deepened, the forest grew quiet. The usual sounds of crickets and owls fell silent. Then the wind stilled.

It took me until I was half way back to the cabin, after the fire simmered out, to notice the usually annoying frogs by the near pond had stopped their chattering.

And then I heard.

A low, deep growl coming from the darkness, just beyond the tree line. My blood ran cold. It didn’t sound like any animal I knew. It was guttural and strange, almost feminine. I stood frozen, trying to convince myself it was just the wind, but deep down, I knew better.

The growl came again, closer this time. My heart raced. I began sprinting to the cabin. I didn't know what it was and I didn't want to find out. 
 
As I fumbled with the door, I heard footsteps—slow and deliberate—crunching on the dry leaves, the sound echoing through the air. I could feel it's gaze as I finally stumbled inside. I slammed the door shut and locked it, my breath coming in ragged gasps. I rushed to the windows and pulled the blinds shut. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something—someone—was out there.

Then I heard the thing again. The sound of scraping claws, dragging against wood. I turned towards the noise at back of the cabin and see the other window I forgot to close. The moonlight was shining enough to show a shadowy figure walking past, the shape of something tall—too tall. It was moving, jerking in an unnatural way, as if it was struggling to keep itself still. And then, it stopped.
I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move.

The figure slowly turned toward the window. Its face was a twisted mockery of a human’s, stretched and warped, with eyes an eerie yellow. I felt my stomach drop. The thing outside had a familiar grotesque smile, looking straight at me. 

I knew it then. This wasn’t some wild animal. This was something far worse.

I stumbled backward, my mind racing with memories of Emma. She had been here, in these woods, a year ago. Had it taken her? Was it out there now, waiting for me to step into its trap?

I grabbed the rifle my grandfather had left behind and held it tightly, but deep down, I knew a weapon wouldn’t save me from something like this. The door shuddered as something pressed against it from the other side.

“Katy” a voice called. It was soft and coaxing, but then it grew darker, more sinister. “Come here. I’ve missed you.”
My blood ran cold. It was Emma’s voice. But I knew it wasn’t really her. My sister was gone.This—thing—was using her voice to lure me out. It wanted me to step into the woods, to make the same mistake she had.

I couldn’t move. My hands were shaking, and my mind raced with everything I heard from my grandma. If I went out there, I would be next.

I backed away from the door, my heart pounding in my chest. The scraping sound came again, this time closer, the wood creaking under the weight of whatever was out there. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. My mind flashed to the year before. Emma. I remembered her smile, her laugh. I remembered the way she used to call my name when we were kids, her voice so full of life. But now… now it was just a whisper in the dark.

The back door crashed open.

I shot.

I don’t know how I made it to my car. My legs were moving on their own, carrying me as fast as they could out of the house. The thing's screech from the house louder than any siren I've ever heard.

I reached the car and managed to lock the door, I looked at the cabin and froze. Standing in the doorway was the creature my grandmother described all those years ago. The long limbs, the eyes, the claws. 

I started pulling out of the driveway as fast as I could, mentally kicking myself for not just driving off right away.
“Come here” it yelled, chasing me, the sound of its claws kicking up tremendousamounts of gravel.

 “We can be together again.” 

I began crying, the sound of my sister bringing hurt and confusion. This isn't how I want to remember her.

My car almost did a donut from how quickly I turned on to the main road, the thing still following me. 

How I wished that it wasn't the middle of the night, maybe then someone could have scared this thing off. I wished a lot of things that night, I prayed for the first time in years. The thoughts clouded my head so much I almost wrecked.

A cold, dry laugh that sent chills crawling up my spine.
“You can’t run from me, sister. You never could.”

And then it jumped in front of my car. 

I didn't really think it fully through when I pressed on the gas, but I did it. My car went right over the monster and kept going until I was 1000000% certain it wasn't chasing me anymore. Only then did I stop at a gas station and buy so many energy drinks it could stop an elephant.

 I haven't been back since. But my parents are planning a big family reunion for later this year at the cabin and I don't know how to tell them why it's a terrible idea.
