 The old ball and chain. That’s what ‘they’ use to describe her. A ball and a chain. I think it means I can barely move with her, and she can’t move without me. I never did like that analogy or is it an idiom, I don’t know. It makes it sound like I'm trapped. Like I don’t have anywhere to go and the furthest distance I’ll ever go is within arm's reach of her. Maybe that’s true but it’s not because she’s a “ball and chain”. They wouldn’t know love even if they dreamed of it every night. See my girl, she’s something special. She loves me. She’s not stopping me from anything. She’s holding me down. That’s what they don’t understand. She keeps me here. She’s a beacon that makes tomorrow a little bit easier to navigate to. 

The thing is… people just get so wrapped up in making assumptions about things they don’t even know or situations they don’t understand. “Oh Lucy, needs you home right now, she’s sick again?”, or “what kind of girl can't cook for herself?”. What if I like to cook for her? Did they ever think of that? Well, I guess that’s not really fair because she can’t really cook. She doesn’t have the hands for it. So, I do the cooking for her… and the shopping, it’s fucking hard to find a good meal for her. But I don’t tell them that… it’s none of their business. ‘

The only reason why they know as much as they do is because it’s pretty damn hard to leave work randomly without an excuse. Luckily a bank in a small town doesn’t get much business so it’s never really a problem. Come to think of it, you never really hear about someone trying to rob a bank in the middle of nowhere. Probably because there’s not much money to take and if you did, there’s a good chance you’d be stealing from family. But even if someone did, the sheriffs got his hands tied up again. People disappearing without a trace. It’s the usual happening once hunting season ends. At least it’s been that way the last couple of years. I always wonder, are people really missing if they don’t have anyone to miss them?

Sorry… I know, I was talking about my co-workers and Lucy and I got distracted. Current events like that tend to stay on the top of your mind around here, you know? Anyway, I can hear her groaning now. She always gets this way when she’s hungry at night. You know, for the amount she eats and her size, you think she has something inside her. I thought I made sure to get enough on my last trip to last at least a month. But she does get ravenous this time of year. It’s nice that she has a faithful husband who’d do anything for her. It’s a labor of love let me tell you. Well, I’ve gotta run. I’ll have to catch up with y’all another day or it might just be me on the menu.
