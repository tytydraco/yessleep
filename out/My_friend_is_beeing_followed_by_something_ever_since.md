I want to share this with you ..
I will start with something i cant ever forget. 
Something that burned into my mind, cost a lot of friendships 
and most likely took a soul.


Just a little bit of info up front.
I am not in contact with said friend anymore, and others of our friends group also broke apart after this.
Somehow it  was never the same after what happened on that night..

It all started as a party night out,
Me my best friend Nikola and another guy named Ellis where hanging around with some other friends..

We live in a little city in switzerland 
a country known for its alps and chocolate, 
bordering france.

As we often did on the weekends,
We drank and had a few smokes of the green, Sitting by our usual spot on a couple of benches near a school next to a few housing units.

A dark quiet place where you could hang out without fear of the cops fucking around with you.

As it turns out one of my friends couldn't handle the booze and started throwing up a bit so we had to say our farewells to him for the night
and as it somehow always magically happens, when the first one leaves, we all start to break up and wander home one by one into the night.
Not that anybody liked to walk home from there at that time of night.
Who does? 

Everybody knows that eerie feeling you get, walking home alone after abandoning all the action and laughing
and beeing confronted by the damp, lonely and somehow threatening silence of the alleys or streets.

If you're lucky enough to live close to each other, you had company walking home.. if you weren't , well.. 

As we slowly began to break up the gang, Nikola, Ellis and me (all living in about the same proximity) 
started to walk home together, laughing and talking 
on our way through the somehow damp looking streetlights.

I remember this evening beeing kind of..
You know when it feels like your packed in cotton? 
Lightheaded, but in a dreadfull manner yes..
Like you can't wait to get home but you think, before you make it something will jump out behind one of the last corners..

Our way home was not even that creepy
there was like two ways home.
One over the streets 
and one going down back alleys and housing units.
Not that bad actually..
As we neared Nikola's appartment block
he was like: "Hey guys i got some dope left, wanna find a dry place and smoke one last J"?

I was thinking it was actually a good idea,
even though i was tired and it was raining pretty hard by then.
It was also cold as shit.
November in Switzerland is no joke.

in this area there was not much to get under
and get away from the cold and so we decided to walk into the industrial zone.
Nikola knew a spot.


The industrial zone was like a few big 
houses made of concrete some kind of logistic centers for trucks and other big company stuff.
Not much to it 
although
there was one abandonend gas station someplace back there
but by that hour (23.15) it was closed already and nobody and nothing was to be seen back there.


As we walked down the road towards what we called the "waro" (an old shopping center that was abandonend in the mid 1970s)
We where already getting into the mode of laughing, because Ellis was so fat, he always used to say 
"Ican't walk that far" 
"come on guys lets turn around" 
and shit like that 

but..

Who knows maybe that night... it was intuition?

Finally, wet from the rain and cold to the bones 
we made it there
creepy as i think back to it..

all alone, next to dark logistic centers and abandonend traintracks leading to nowhere. 

If i think of it,  not even daytimes you saw many people back there..
Come to think, i never saw anybody back there myself for a long long time, as everything is pretty run down.
It must be that there's just nothing interesting down there to go to.

As we stand in front of it, we knew we couldn't enter normally, because the windows where shut with wood
and nailed to the walls.
As Nikola wasn't there the first time he showed us how to get in.

The way in was easy for a 16 year old :

Climb the fence 
put your jackets over the barb wire (old and somehow not very sharp no more)
jump over
After this we went to the door.

A big door they have to like roll up, so you can bring in goods from the back of a van or truck. To open it u need to lift the under part up together, one to the right one to the left.
So one person got to slide under the door and then roll it up a bit  manually from the inside and keep it in his grip until we are all in.

Nikola slid under, rolled it up and we went inside, happy to get out of the rain.

Upstairs was more like empty and there was nothing to sit on, also there was cold wind coming through board cracks in the windows
We had to use our flashlights that we had on our cell phones to walk around inside because the light was practically non existent

As it was really cold upstairs we decided to go down into the office rooms.

This is two stair flights down.

Think of this place as empty 
but not really empty. 
There was some old tables and chairs.
Some papers and flyers 
and also some old posters on the ground.

The floor down here was also somehow wet even though i have no idea where the water came from.. most  rooms to the left where even flooded.
So we had to go to the right, into a large room where they used to have breaks i suppose.

There where 2 chairs and one wooden crate on the ground.
I sat on the crate and started to build a joint.

Nikola in front of me in a chair.
Ellis to the right.

Behind Nikola the only entrance to the room.
Behind Nikola was the only way back up.
As i was the one building the joint the other two where on the phones playing a game and talking, that resulted in light beeing cast on the walls.

Something caught my attention in the back left corner of the entrance as i looked up to finish the joint.
Something black, just a short glimpse but enough to give me a feeling of unease, as if somebosy peeked in through the doorway and bobbed right back behind the corner, like a kid not wanting to be caught.
I had a feeling, like the feeling that the blackness of the darkness and the blackness of the thing that caught my attention was somehow different, somehow more contured than just pure night shadows.

I said to Ellis" did you see that"? and he denied.
So of course Nikola, paranoid as he was asked me what i saw and where it was..
He said we should just rather go up and smoke and go home afterwards anyway.

We started to shift into an uneasy mood getting paranoid i turned on my flashlight on the phone and shined around the room.

Nothing.

But again something caught my attention, and this time we all saw it.
It was the blink of a second as we saw a dark shape the form of a head bob out behind the corner and  quickly bob back.
We thought it might be a hallucination for a second but not even 3 seconds into that thought it bobbed right back out this time only about 3 feet above the floor instead of chest high, peeking through the doorway, seemingly losing it's caution of us by the second.

I screamed for everybody to get the fuck out of here
 and as the only way was straight through that doorway we ran not caring about anything only getting out of there 

I was running for my life in that moment, surprisingly Ellis right behind me and Nikola last.
As i ran past the doorway i felt cold, very cold but only for a short second, running straight and to the left up the stairway i looked back and saw Nikola running through the doorway.

The moment he  came out of the room i saw a shadow merge with him.. i cant explain how or what, this is the closest i can get to explaining:
 something jumped into him.

Not really thinking much about it we keep running up the stairs.
I rolled the door up as fast as i could 
let Ellis roll under it and he held it open with his back long enough for me to get out,
turn and see Nikola crawling out under the door too.


We let the door fall with a BANG, not even thinking about putting jackets over the barb wire we climbed it 
cutting our hands pretty badly, not even feeling pain due to the adrenalin.

We ran all the way to the street we lived on and didnt look back not once.

As we got to the houses we where laughing and joking about how stupid that was but deep in my body i felt dread still.

I said goodnight and went home to sleep.
We stayed friends and forgot about what happened that night pretty quick thinking about other important stuff.

But as i look back alot changed after that night.

Nikolas parents broke up, he started taking hard drugs in the coming months and consuming all kinds of shit.

Still he was my friend we hung out alot still way beyond the event untill one night in february 2016.

3 years after what we saw in the basement of the abandoned store we where once again at our spot by the school house a couple friends me , Nikola and Ellis.

Somebody came up with the idea of taking some LSD because it was a boring evening so 4 of us said yes including me and Nikola.

Ellis did not take anything and went home later.

What happened that night chills me to the bone still today.

As you know LSD makes you feel and experience stuff alot more vivid.
You can imagine how this burned into my mind.

It all started off normal, we took our trips hung around smoking some dope for about 40 minutes or so and started to get high, at first it was funny and everything we walked around alot looking at shit even our hands..

Somewhen we started filming ourselfs and just like goof around with our shadows, and everytime i would like show Nikola my hand in the light he would have this demonic laugh.
Really loud and long and like i dont even know just demonic.

While i was high it started to freak me out his eyes started to sink in and look dark around the edges.

All in all ot was still a cool experience and my horror trip went away later on again.
Even though Nikola started talking about weird shit like "Stefan looks like walking death" (stefan was another friend of us)
Or " bro do you know i cant sleep some nights because my room feels dark"? 
Or " bro i cant feel my soul no more". 


We thought he was just high but as we where coming down off of the trip on that damp cold morning sitting on the bench at that school 
Me Nikola and two other dudes started looking at the videos we filmed that night while high.

In one video you can see Nikola standing next to the school doing some kind of dancemoves with his hands laughing his laugh 

And very close behind him,
peeking out behind the corner of the school was the dark faceless head before bobbing back behind the wall quickly like a playing child.


( i freaked out completely, ran all the way home) 

( we stopped hanging together )

(Yes i watched the video again and it was real, my friends that i sent it to saw it too)

We don't have contact anymore and the last i heard Nikola is a junky now..

I think that thing took his soul and is slowly eating away on it..
