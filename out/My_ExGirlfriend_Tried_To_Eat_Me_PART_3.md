[PART 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jko4uo/my_exgirlfriend_tried_to_eat_me_part_2/)

The dark stirred around me as I felt my eyelids slide down, slowly revealing the world around me. The cold tapestry of drug induced psychosis started to vanish. But even with that blanket being pulled from my eyes there was only so much that my vision could grab onto. A faint light directly above me cast a faint circle in the ground around where I was seated. A light that, though blinding, barely illuminated any of the room I found myself in. Leaving me to wonder the scale of where I had been placed. A faint crackling and chanting tune emanating from within the darkness.

Despite the absence of any discernible environment I can still recall the very distinctive smell of that room. It was salty and ashy, sticking to my tongue as a fragrance that climbed through the air. Emanating from somewhere within that dark hovel and churning up my innards with a painful need. I could worry about that later.

I shifted from where I sat, pulling on the many leather belts that wound around my arms and legs. Shuffling and straining against the restraints as I flung my head back and forth. Urging every muscle to strain and break me out of the great oak chair. All I ended up with was a painful sting in my neck and friction burns along my weakened limbs.

Now, stuck in that chair, stress taking over my brain there was only one thing I could default to.

“HELLLLLLLLLLLP! HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLP!”

I doubted that my ear shattering calls for aid would even be audible if I was underground or in a condemned building. That said I wouldn’t know until I tried.

Eventually I fell into a steady rhythm of screaming that eventually drew all the moisture from my throat and I was left coughing and spluttering droplets of blood onto my shirt.

Then the music started up. A candy coloured and sickly sweet love ballad that would have been right at home in an eighties pop musical. It was so unexpected that I could feel everything in my head stop and begin to try and place the song. I’d heard it before hadn’t I?

But as I was busy trying to place the song a clicking of heels started to approach my resting place. Not walking, a full sprint that was rapidly gaining momentum. My head whirled up just in time to see someone lurch into my field of vision. A pair of sharp talons digging into my exposed hands as they threw themselves towards me.

“Miel!” It was Julia. But I only knew that from her voice which in itself was muffled by the absurd getup she was dressed in.

She was wearing a french maid’s dress. It was short, ending well above her knees and letting her slender legs be fully exposed. Coated in a pair of shining high heeled boots that extended beneath her dress and reflected the white light in sharp folds along her legs. Her arms were in much a similar state but I found myself the most unnerved by her ensembles mask.

A bondage mask with a pair of bulging black glass eyes that obscured her face and left nothing but a contorted mouth of vampiric sharp teeth peeling through. Gums, tooth and flesh that grinned at me with feverish intensity. It gave her the appearance of a giant bug more than anyone I recognised.

My registration of her carefully curated uniform and all the tiny little white flowers and hearts that adorned her bosom was abandoned when that platter of fangs and meat crashed into my lips. It felt like I was being smothered by petals of soft flesh that licked the sides of my face. Slathering my skin in a thick coating of loving saliva.

She abruptly pulled away from the gesture, pulling my tongue out by the tip of her teeth before releasing it. Leaving me sitting there stupidly with my tongue sticking out as she laughed.

“I’m so glad you’re awake! I was worried I’d gone a bit overboard with the dosage.” Her soft words brought my old anger back, shaking off the final throngs of the drugs as I screamed back at her.

“WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, YOU BI-” Her wrist flicked across my face, leaving a stinging red mark that snapped my protest quiet as she giggled at my words.

“SO much energy! I wasn’t expecting you to be this feisty Miel!” She started to dance in place, twirling and spinning, in tune with the music that murmured incoherently behind her. A twisted doll dancer in sync to her music box.

I was mesmerised by the sight. fighting for control as I watched her dance, the stinging in my face already burning through my blood. I needed to keep her talking. If she was going to kill me because I broke up with her then maybe there was some way I could delay her until I could escape.

“W-why are you doing this?” Her neck twisted towards me. Bending at a jarring angle that almost screwed her head away from her torso as she pirouetted and came to rest. Those gleaming glass eyes shining back my scared and frightful reflection.

“Haven’t you figured that out yet?” She cooed quietly as she drew closer, nearly leaning in for another kiss as her hot breath caressed my healing mouth.

“I love you Miel, I love you so fucking much. I’ve dated so many men and women in my time on this earth and none have been able to satisfy me the way you do. I want nothing more than to be close to you. I want to feel you as part of me, to be inside of you and you in me. Experiencing everything you do. And I want you to feel the same.” Her voice had been rising and growing more detached and manic throughout her speech. But in the strangest sense I felt that she was being more honest with me now then she’d ever been. That I was finally seeing her for who she truly was.

It was horrifying. But even in that horror I found an attractive quality to it. A void that threatened to pull me ever closer and encase me inside of her own small frame. As though I really would become part of her.

“I love you. So the next few weeks, I’ll make sure you love me, and then we can be one…” My brain started at that.

“Weeks?” I coughed carefully, leaning back to try and avoid any more of her outbursts. She nodded in reply, turning back around as though pulled by strings. While her head was locked firmly on my helpless body.

“These things take time, but don’t you worry Miel, mommy’s going to take good care of you and, who knows! Maybe I’ll even reward you if you play nice.” She continued to walk back into the dark. Her limbs moving independently of each other as she twitched and twirled her demented dance.

“But that’s for later, I’ll make you lunch and then we can have time in the Red Box.” Her laugh trailed off as she vanished leaving me alone with nothing but my own thoughts and the continued reel of old love ballads.

I needed to get out of here. Being cooped up in this place against my will was going to drive me mad. Julia’s game wasn’t something that I wanted any part of. I didn’t want to be locked away and delivered food, cut off from the outside world without any connection to the people that I used to know.

Then there was the other half of my brain. The part that had been thrilled by her words, the vivid images popping across my eyes. Lashings, beatings, cuttings and all the pain that I would be dealt. My blood raced through my veins as the near infectious passion made my breath ragged.

I was fighting with myself. What kind of man was I to want the punishment she would inflict upon me?

Recollections of flicking tongues and mashing flesh beneath skin. Dancing naked before the flickering lights that shone from the sky and the glowering eyes that cut through our bodies with such vicious hunger. I wanted it. I wanted it and it made me sick to think of how I would look laid out before her.

I swallowed my own lust back and spat a glob of blood onto the floor as I became acutely aware of the drying slime on my lips.

“Disgusting,” I muttered to myself. “Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting, disgusting.” I chanted. Doing everything I could to block out those songs.



It was many hours before Julia returned. During which I had grown accustomed to the noises that lingered in the air around my island of light. Groans, moans and calls that were near indistinguishable from the loop of songs that continued to repeat. Interspersed occasionally with long winded recordings of Julia talking adnauseam about her infatuation. Words that soothed my skin and made me want her, almost as much as they made me shudder in that chair. Wishing I could deafen myself and not have to listen to her silver tongue any longer.

Although of this painful coagulation of calls that hammered away at my mind while I was strapped to that chair, there was one noise that always set me off. At irregular intervals I heard what I could only describe as grinding. A low rumbling noise of something heavy, like metal, wood or rock dragging against concrete. Something was shifting just beyond my eyes. Something that was far too large to possibly exist in a basement.

I had assumed that the roof light was only about two and a half meters off the ground but I still had no concept of the room's space around me. As though the only thing tangible within that emptiness was my tiny alcove of light. An island encircled by a great monster that I couldn’t discern. Hanging on the very edges of my vision.

It was the squeaking of trolley wheels that signaled Julia’s return. Piercing into the light as her heels clicked against the ground and she rolled a metal trolley forward. Atop it was a well laid out spread of cutlery with the food concealed behind a rounded metal half sphere.

“I hope you’re hungry!” She chirped as she slid the dome away.

The food that was revealed was a lavish tray of what looked like fried mushrooms. Sliced apart to reveal a tender white flesh that was garnished with a striking pesto sauce that stood out from a strange red liquid drizzled in a single waving line across the dish. I could feel my mouth watering as I watched the steam rolling from the plate. Becoming rapidly aware that it had been nearly a day since my last full meal.

Julia inched closer as she removed a seat for herself from beneath the trolley’s cloth covering and started to cut my food.

“Open wide…” She whispered quietly as she held the fork towards my mouth, swooping it in lazy circles to try and entice me to accept her treat.

As good as it smelled, I was already resolved to not eat any of what she’d made. I had no doubts that this meal would be heavily laden with whatever drugs she needed to keep me passive and docile.

I cast a glance along the fork back to the strange woman standing before me. Barely recognisable as my ex.

Her smile twisted slightly at the corners as she tried to hold herself back and remain casual about my refusal to eat. She brushed the food against the corners of my mouth. The sauce stained my lips and gave me the briefest tastes of garlic, red wine and basil. But I still refused to part my clamped mouth and let her feed me. Craning my neck at awkward angles as the fork chased my face.

My protest at eating the food was soon silenced as her free hand clamped around my throat with surprising force. Knocking the air out of me in a choked gasp. Before she shoved the fork down to the back of my throat. Causing me to gag as I absentmindedly chewed on the mash of flavours and swallowed, sucking in air as the prongs of the fork scraped along the roof of my mouth.

“That wasn’t so hard, was it?” Julia chimed in. Her cheery voice cracked with a sharpened and irritated edge.

“Now will you eat like a good boy? Or do I have to shove this down your throat?” As her tongue dragged across her teeth she pressed the fork into my skin just below my eye. The Pointed tips dug softly into my body as blood dribbled down my face and I tensed up. Doing what little I could to lean back.

“I… I’ll eat.” I swallowed painfully as another slab of mushroom was forced into my throat.

“W-what made you pick mushrooms?” I asked carefully. Hoping to sneak a word in between bites that may put my feeding on hold, even if momentarily. I don’t remember her ever having an affinity for mushrooms over our relationship. I had never really bothered cooking them and of her peculiar food habits mushrooms had never been noticed.

“Oh! Well I’m glad you asked!” She whistled as her fork clacked against the backs of my teeth.

“I’ve been wanting to experiment with more vegan dishes. To make what's to come easier.”

“Yeah uh, what’s to-”

“It’s also good for your health!” Her words sliced through my own before I could ask the questions that I’d wanted to. Her fingers moved simultaneously. One pivoting another chunk of food into my mouth and her other mockingly poking my stomach. A sharp nail digging deep into my soft flesh. Tracing a cut that followed a line right beneath my belly button.

The sharpness of her nail sent a pang of pleasure across my stomach.

“Come now, eat up, we’re nearly ready for the Red Box.” There it was. She’d mentioned it early but I had thought it merely a weird euphemism for a place that she’d… indulge in her fantasies. Only now that I listened to the way she spoke were her words filled with a strange longing resonance. Making this ‘Red Box’ sound more akin to an altar then a strange snuff setup that she’d construct. But maybe my nerves were getting to me. Maybe she had always thought of her content as high art and had simply been smart enough to conceal that part of her from me. Despite how much she didn’t not share in bed.

My thoughts hadn’t slowed her pace as she continued to shovel food into my mouth. Suffocating any deeper reflections before I had finished my meal and found her kissing crumbs from my lips.

“Miel…” she grinned widely, the glass eyes of her mask shimmering in a strange blinking rhythm.

“I’m going to take off your restraints now. You’ve been good and once I do I’m going to walk you to the Red Box, can you do that for me sweetie?”

I made sure to nod in a way that was agreeable but restrained. I didn’t want to reveal how eager I actually was to escape this infernal basement. The songs, the sounds and the strange absence of detail. I was ready to run and abandon this place, Julia’s wishes be damned.

But where would I run to? I didn’t want to charge blindly into the dark, especially if I ran towards whatever that deafening grinding noise was. That said, I doubt Julia would be exactly amicable. She’d drugged me and assaulted me while I was locked here and there now lay a wary tension across Julia’s whole body.

I didn’t want to provoke her. But I knew I needed to muster up the courage to. I knew I could beat her. I was larger then she was and even with the drugs in my system I was still awake enough to recognise Julia as my abuser. I figured going blind would be better than being stuck where I am now.

She slowly started to unbuckle the belts until I was soon sitting there of my own will. Rising until I was staring down at the woman in leather and heels. I initially wasn’t sure if she was aware that I knew had a fighting chance. Thinking that her actions had already worn me down enough that I would be nodding along to her commands without protest.

I offered the briefest of scowl’s before I rushed her and slammed my full body weight against her chest. I immediately felt her go before me as her head bounced back against the hard concrete floor and the air was knocked from her lungs. 

I wasted no time as I stuck one of my legs across her waist to hold her in place before I hammered my fist into her nose without pause. The back of her head cutting through the empty space with a grinding crack of bone against cement.

I felt myself smile at the twisting snap as I started to stand up. Julia was lying limp and unmoving beneath my feet as my breath ran ragged. Adrenaline surging through my veins as I laughed out at her body.

“STAY DEAD!” I screamed, not entirely sure what to say as the slow sinking reality swam back to me. The only way onward being deeper into that soup that had encircled my stay and been as much a jailer as Julia had. 

Braving through it was the only way on and with a heaving difficulty I pressed forward. Walking hands first to balance myself and feel for any sort of distinct interior. After about ten steps I glanced over my shoulder and saw the still immobile form of my ex lying at the foot of my chair. Light still burned into the ground at the distance I had left. I was moving.

I turned forward again and persisted in the walk as I continued to count my steps. One. Five. Ten. Sixteen. Twenty. Twenty-six.

I whipped my head back to my point of origin. Julia and that pinprick of light were still there. Just much further. It was difficult to tell if I was making any progress at all. The area of this room being far larger then I could ever originally imagined. If I was near the centre then that would mean that this entire room would be roughly half a football field in length and width. But that was assuming I would have walked into a wall by now. Something that was distressing in its absence with every increasing step.

I had been walking for roughly ten minutes when I heard a deafening and earth shattering clamour of scraping rock that burrowed into my skull. That sound had returned and it was seemingly coming from right above me.

My legs worked immediately as I started to run back towards the light. Fleeing the unknown for that familiar comfort I had in that chair. Known over whatever unknown was moving in that blackness.

Trying to gauge any shape through the black proved fruitless before I swung my head back ahead to keep my gait true. Only to stumble to a complete stop.

My already pounding heart quickened. My eyes dilating, my lungs forcing my breath to grow shallow as I tried to steady my legs. My whole body started to twitch and tense in a spasmic rhythm of primal fear.

I swallowed. Blinking as I watched Julia begin to stand on her shaking legs. Hoisting herself up from the ground with blood hanging in thick strands to her hair. Her torso hunched and her back twisting as the bones along her spine stood out distinctly against the wash of red around her neck. Bones that cracked and twisted with the force of her own movements as her twisted and contorted mouth came to face me. Blood stained her sand white teeth.

“You… you limp dicked sack of worthless meat.” She groaned painfully through her smashed nose. Despite her hateful words her mouth was still screwed up in a stretched, leering grin. I had a gut feeling that she was still holding herself back and for some reason I felt thankful for that fact. Even though the idea of Julia showing any kind of restraint made little sense.

I had killed her. There wasn’t a person alive who would have been able to get up after having the back of their head cracked open with the force of an angry chef hammering an omelette to pieces.

“No.” I whispered meekly as I slipped backwards, moving away from that light that she now occupied. The noise grew louder in my wake.

“Disappointed? Or are you happy for me? Holding back for your perfect sweetheart Miel?” She teased coyly. Leaning slightly in a strange attempt at a cutesy gesture that was somewhat damaged by her right hand. The fingers of which all spasmed and lurched together with the erratic pulsing of a dying spider.

“No… no!” I shouted. What little resistance I had held withered in my throat as I continued to step further away from the bent frame of my ex. Her torso nearly folded down over her midsection as though she was structured in the same divided sections of an insect. Bony fingers clawing aimlessly at the ground.

“I killed you! You goddamn monster!” I screamed. Hoping that anything I could say would be able to shove her back to reality. Instead her neck cracked and I could feel her eyes twitching beneath those glazed glass bulbs.

“Miel, please. I’m nothing but a fetish.” Then she started to charge towards me. Crawling rapidly on all fours held up by her fingers and high heels. Teeth gnashing as her back rose with expanding lungs and a bellowing howl reverberated in the darkness around me. I bolted back the way I had came. Sprinting as the tapping of her nails gradually gained on my footfall. A suspiciously quiet noise that belied her ghoulish form that had broken its own limbs and brandished its fanged teeth as tools that would be put to a simple, violent use.

Her hooting cry whipped at my legs as I ran. Turning to compensate for every slight shit in her own movements. Knowing that it was certain that she would be upon me within seconds.

Pain shocked through my leg as I felt her talons wriggle beneath my skin. Slicing away that dry peel to reach tender flesh. I couldn’t keep running and fell forward slamming my face into the ground with such force that I heard the bone snap and stab through my skin. The sound coming from inside my skull and ringing through my ears. Metal flavours spewing into my mouth.

With that jarring knock to the face I completely lost all sense of direction as I felt Julia crawl onto my back. Her heels dug into my neck as her fingers started to dance across my cheeks and invade my sockets. Painfully toying with the spheres that they so rudely brushed past. Nails threatening at any moment to pluck my eyes from my face.

“Are you going to behave now? Miel?” Her voice was void of any wrath. Kind. Warm. Soothing as her tongue trailed through my hair, squirming across my scalp.

“FUCK YOU!” I shouted back in protest, a scream of pain more than confidence as my eyes were just about pushed to a bursting threshold. 

Her response was immediate as I briefly regained composure with the removal of her fingers. Only for a hand to interlace my hair and shove my head back against the ground in a smashing that was over before it had even started. I could feel my wounded face spewing blood onto the floor as my brain fought to stay awake. Trying to see anything past the wall of tears that stung my bleeding sockets.

“I’m so sorry Miel.” She whispered into my ear as she stroked my aching face with a sharpened claw. Every caress against my weeping dents set me on fire. The mixture of pain and pleasure dripped from my lips and my breathing grew deeper with my rising body temperature and my familiar desires began to return.

Julia was more than aware of my appetite for pain. Her other hand tip-toeing along my spine before it slithered beneath the waistband of my pants.

I could feel my tears continue to pour in tandem with the loving language that she lavished my skin with. Her sticky words contrasting her rough and violent actions as she massaged me.

“I never wanted to hurt you this badly. But you have helped me realise just how much you need this. So lost, so afraid. I can see now that of all the people I’ve met, you’re going to be more special than any of them. This appetite is something beautiful.”

This was already too much for me. Turning to drag me towards whatever this ‘Red Box’ was.

Sliding along the ground I struggled to maintain consciousness while Julia hummed a tune to herself. A chirpy and giddy song that helped stave off the blanket of sleep which threatened to wrap its way around my brain and lull me back into a drug induced haze. The toxins from my meal burning a newfound acidic texture into my tongue. The room continued to spin around me.

I was nearly gone when I felt our journey come to an end and I glanced up to see what had halted our trek.

Staring upward I saw that we were now facing the edges of a vast dark red wall that extended as far as I could see into the darkness around us. It was a strange pebbled texture that cast tiny pockmarked shadows along its muted exterior.

Julia feigned a strange lurching motion before the wall itself  seemed to peel apart with a low hum and the curving texture of an orange skin. Cut open with a rough uneven knife. Revealing A thin opaque shield of black liquid that glistened with a viscous sheen.

“The first time is always the hardest.” Her malice had subsided somewhat and now I could see her as she had originally appeared to me. When I had met her all those years ago at that drowsy diner. 

“But soon our union will be complete. You should be happy for us, Miel.” She hoisted me up with one arm as her other hand traced over my own. A cold metal burning through my ring finger as I looked down and saw a folded metal bird encircling my single digit.

“Seeing as you didn’t ask me then. I’m asking you now.” She beamed before pivoting or intertwined bodies so that my back was facing the wall of cold black liquid embedded within the door frame.

“Mie- Liam. Will you marry me and complete me and relish all this wonderful passion with me?” In the strangest way I felt touched that she had referred to me by my real name. Not by a dehumanising moniker that was reflective of how she viewed me.

But I couldn’t say yes. I’d be consenting to a whole host of horrible things that I couldn’t even begin to fathom. Things that though tantalising to a mind as sick as my own would only result in a fate I didn’t want to consider.

But the blood that was beginning to dry against my broken face was still very fresh. Salty tears stinging the still exposed words urging me to betray my own thoughts. Lips trembling, I told her what she wanted to hear as I was drawn back over the threshold.

“I do.” I wept weakly. Hoping that my meek lie was enough to stave off her wrath. At that acceptance of my role in her sick ritual she nodded at me. Polite and uniquely more vulnerable than she had ever felt in our lives before. Even now I still believe that in that split second she had dropped any and all of her guards and allowed herself to treat me as an equal. Before she rested her hands firmly on my chest and shoved me backwards into the Red Box. That dark liquid obscuring any truth that she may have offered. 

Leaving me to float aimlessly through this unnatural space. With nothing but that cool circlet’s embrace on my chilled finger for company.
