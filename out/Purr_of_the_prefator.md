I first noticed the cat a week after Mrs. Robson’s funeral. The street smelled of damp earth and fading flowers, petals crushed under shoes. Her porch sagged, milk bottles still lined up, untouched. That’s where it sat, as if waiting for something—or someone. Thin, gray, with eyes too bright for dusk. They glimmered like wet metal in the fading light.

My chest ached with guilt I couldn’t name. I should have checked on her sooner, on the house, on the street. I felt small, insignificant, yet the cat’s gaze pressed down on me, patient, accusing. When I blinked, it vanished, leaving me shivering, unsure if I was terrified or ashamed.

Every night after, it appeared in the periphery, just enough to make my heart jerk. Fear mixed with fascination—I wanted to look away, but couldn’t. Its presence awakened something in me I didn’t understand, a dark curiosity, a pull I resisted and craved at once.
 
The Wilkins began feeding the cat, and I watched with envy and dread. Mrs. Wilkins’ soft voice trembled as she murmured, “Poor thing… hungry, all ribs and dust.” I wanted to feel compassion, but jealousy gnawed at me. Why couldn’t I care so easily, so openly?

Night after night, Mr. Wilkins lingered, speaking softly to the cat. His hands shook. I hated the quiet intimacy he shared with something I barely understood. Milk curdled, shadows stretched, and I felt powerless, observing the slow erosion of a man I once nodded to on the street.

A thrill flickered beneath the fear—I sensed the pull, the pattern, the way the cat watched and waited. A part of me wanted it to turn to me next.

The morning after Mr. Wilkins vanished completely, I found the first gift on my doorstep: a black feather, twisted into a knot as if tied by careful, deliberate hands. I picked it up, fingers trembling, and felt the cold seep into my skin.

The next day, a small bird without eyes lay in the same spot. Its feathers ruffled unnaturally, as if it had moved after death. I threw it into the street, ashamed to be terrified of something so small, but the next morning brought another gift: a single black tooth, smooth and polished like obsidian.

Each offering felt heavier than the last. They weren’t just objects—they were statements, warnings, remnants of something I couldn’t name. I began checking the doors before sleep, inspecting the corners of rooms for shadows that didn’t belong, but the objects kept coming.

The purring inside my mind began. Not outside. Inside. And I wondered, with a guilty thrill, if I could stop listening.

One night, I woke to a sound I had never imagined: soft, steady purring. Not outside. Not behind the door. Inside.

I froze, ears straining, heart hammering in a rhythm that seemed too loud for the silence. The light flicked on, spilling across the room. At the foot of my bed sat the cat. Thin, gray, with eyes wide and bright—almost human. They reflected me.

In the window, I saw Mrs. Wilkins standing in her yard, face tilted to the sky, unmoving. Her lips curved in a slow, patient smile. Like the cat.

I couldn’t move. The shadows stretched unnaturally, curling toward me, pooling around my feet. Every floorboard groaned. Every object in the room shifted slightly, as if breathing.

The air was thick, suffocating, pressing down on my chest. The purring continued, steady, mocking. And in that moment, I realized the waiting was not about the cat alone. It was about me.

I whispered Mrs. Robson’s name under my breath, though I wasn’t sure whether it was a prayer, a warning, or an acknowledgment of the truth: the eyes that watched me weren’t just in the cat—they were inside me.

By dawn, I had gathered the offerings: feathers, tooth, dead bird. The edge of the garden became my stage. Dirt crumbled between my fingers as I drew a circle, placing the objects inside, sprinkling salt along the rim. My hands shook—not from weakness, but from the weight of expectation.

Each whisper of Mrs. Robson’s name felt like a confession. Fear gripped my chest, but beneath it, a strange thrill pulsed. I was performing power, pretending I could control what I had never understood.

Night fell. Silence. The whispers, the purring, the shadows—they were gone. Relief brushed against me, but unease lingered. And sometimes, when the wind shifted, a faint purr echoed inside me. My pulse quickened, part terror, part exhilaration.

Shadows bent unnaturally. Milk soured in bowls I hadn’t poured. Mirrors reflected a movement I didn’t make. I tried to deny it. Tried to tell myself the cat had gone, the terror was over. But the truth clawed at me: it had never been outside.

I pressed my hands to my face and felt the predator within. Panic surged, mingled with a perverse thrill. I was both terrified of what I had become and intoxicated by the power it promised.

Recognition hit like a knife. The waiting, the gifts, the whispers—they had been me all along. The predator in my chest had always been awake. And I could no longer pretend it was not.

Milk soured, objects shifted, shadows twisted. Animals froze when I approached. The street became my stage, every sound, movement, and whisper amplified in my awareness. Fear still flickered within me, but the thrill—the intoxicating thrill—grew stronger.

I began to linger in alleys, observing children play, noting the smallest gestures. The predator within me was awake, alive. Shame bubbled up at the thought of it, but it was quickly drowned by the thrill of my own power.

Neighbors whispered about “something in the street.” They were right. But they did not see me, the predator, fully conscious, fully awake, savoring the tension of being both observer and hunter.

Acceptance came quietly, a shiver in the marrow. I prowled the night, aware of every heartbeat, every breath of wind. Children peeked from windows. Pets froze mid-step. The thrill coursed through me like fire.

Sometimes, I glimpsed Mrs. Wilkins or the memory of Mr. Wilkins’ hollow eyes, but they were ghosts. I was fully awake, fully predator. Mirrors reflected something inhuman, beautiful, terrifying.

Fear of my own nature had vanished, replaced by awe, fascination, and a guilty delight. The cat was gone. There was no other. There had never been.

The town slept, oblivious. Milk soured, shadows moved, objects shifted. I prowled the edges of gardens, alleys, and streets, fully aware, fully awake.

Sometimes, in quiet moments, I glimpsed the girl I had been—afraid, fragile, human—but it was fleeting. The predator pulsed beneath my skin, and I welcomed it. Thrill, guilt, fear—they blended, inseparable.

The wind whispered my name. I whispered back: “I am here. I am watching.” And for the first time, I understood the truth fully. The waiting had only just begun, but I was ready. Hungry. Patient.
