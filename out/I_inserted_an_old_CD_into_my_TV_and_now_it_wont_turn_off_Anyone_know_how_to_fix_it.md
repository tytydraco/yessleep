2 Years ago, i found an old VHS tape of me and my old dog in 1996. I was cleaning out my attic, and discovered an old box in my attic, full of old books, comics, movies, VHS tapes, and CD's. One of which included a porno. We dont talk about that. I went through the endless piles of books and VHS tapes, and came across an old childhood video, with me and my dog. It was in a creepy looking, wooden, small box with a note attached to the other side of the box, but i didnt bother to read it. For some reason, it was the only video recorded of me, which is odd.

I remember my parents recording at least a dozen videos of me as a child. I didn't think much about it at the time. I took out my old PS1, along with an old box TV, and connected the PS1 to the TV, then inserted the disc into the console. Nostalgia hit me as the old eerie tune of the PS1 played. I played the disc. It was a cute, low quality, 15 second video of me playing fetch with my dog in a small, empty park in the afternoon when i was 4.  It started to replay. It was weird, but again, i thought nothing of it. I took the disk out, and i decided that it would be a good idea to play some old 2000's rock music while continuing to clean out my attic. I took the old disk out. and replaced it with the disk containing the music.

After about 15 minutes, i hear static, then, the video of me and my dog started to play again. Confused, and at the time a bit scared, i went over to the other end of the attic to check out the Playstation. I opened up the Playstation, and took the disc out, but the video still played. I checked the CD to see if it was the wrong one, then i went back over to the other end of the room where the disc of me and my dog was, and saw it laying in the 'trash' pile. I picked it up, and took a closer look at it, before i noticed some untidy handwriting on the CD. It said "DO NOT PLAY" on it. I was confused. I went back to where the Playstation was, and looked back up at the TV. My dog looked, weirder? Its face was a bit bloodied, and it was looking at the camera with an extremely blank, eerie stare, while i threw  a bone across the park. My dog didn't budge, until the video cut to a clip where my dog was returning with the bone, wagging its tail.

I thought i was just experiencing the Mandela effect, so i shook it off. I took out the disk, and again, it continued playing. I re-inserted the disk, and the music played again, for a second, i felt a rush a relief and tension running down my spine. but that only lasted a few seconds, because the video started playing again. I unplugged the playstation from the tv, but it was still playing, so i unplugged it from the outlet, still playing. At this point i was telling myself "what the fuck.". I was a bit scared, but mostly panicked and confused. I unplug the TV, it was still playing. I froze for a few moments. I slowly stand up, and rush down the ladder, close the attic up, and left it there, just playing.  Luckily i couldn't hear it from the first floor. For the rest of the day, i thought about it.

After about a month i forgot about it. One night, at about 3:56am, i heard static, with the dreaded sound of me laughing. I wake up almost immediately, run to my living room, and see the video of me and my dog playing on my TV. I felt a shiver run down my spine, and heard someone breathing down my neck, or atleast, i thought i did. I turned on the lights and looked at my TV. My dog was staring at the camera. One of his eyes were missing. His head was covered in blood, and his front left leg was missing. I was frozen, mortified. What is going on?

I open the attic, and see the old box TV, playing the same video. I notice a pink sticky note by my feet. I picked it up. It read: " If youre reading this note, it's already too late. You've opened the box. I'm guessing the person reading this is Jason? (me) Every video that we've taken of you has been... Odd. Unfortunate events keep happening when we watch video's of you. While watching every video, somebody would get injured, or sick, so we decided to destroy all of them." The back of the note said: "While watching this video, your dog passed away. We tried to destroy it, but for some reason, it kept coming back to us. So we decided to seal it away. In this order, Destroy the CD. Burn it. Get a crucifix and destroy all of the TV's with the video currently  playing on it. Hire a priest and purify your house, Then move away." So i did just that. I decided to move in with my wife after that.

A year later, i was speaking with her in the living room when i noticed a blank disc. As soon as i looked up at the TV i saw me and my dog. I felt a shiver run down my spine. A tear rolled down my cheek. I turned to my wife, and told her to get out of the house. She left the house without any reluctance. I decided to do what my parents did. I put the disc away in a box, and brought it to a priest to get purified, and buried it. The only problem is, The TV will not stop playing the video.

It's been another year. We can't destroy the TV, or even turn it off. Whenever we try to, we feel an overwhelming wave of shame just before we destroy it or turn it off, resulting in us failing to destroy it. Please, somebody help? We cant handle it anymore. Were so desperate to stop it, you couldn't even imagine. Any advice?
