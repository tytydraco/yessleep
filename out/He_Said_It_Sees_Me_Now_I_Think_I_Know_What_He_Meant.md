I was making a soufflé when my best friend Larry barged into my apartment.

That might sound unimportant, but if you’ve ever attempted to make one, you would know a soufflé is a delicate symphony of timing and silence. A tender fusion of roux and milk that must cool before yolks are folded in, and then the whites, oh, the whites… they must be folded *just so*, to preserve the air bubbles that make it rise. Open the oven door too early, slam a cupboard too hard, and it's game over.

I was on the track of perfecting that dance—until Larry barged in the front door like he was executing a dynamic entry.

The ramekin slipped from my hands and shattered on the floor. The sound echoed like a gunshot through my kitchen. I was seconds from letting him know a piece of my mind until I saw his face.

The usual cocky grin was there, but something was... wrong. His eyes were bloodshot and rimmed with red, like he hadn’t slept in days. They weren’t focused on me; they were fixated on the ceiling light above my kitchen island, wide and terrified. His skin was pale, lips parted like he wanted to speak but didn’t trust the words to hold together.

Then he said it, voice barely above a whisper: “It sees me.”

I froze, the whisk slipping from my hand.

His eyes didn’t move. Still locked on the light.

“What’s wrong?” I asked quietly, stepping toward him.

He flinched. “It… it sees me but I… I can’t see *it*. I *can’t see* anything at all.” all the while grinning ear to ear.”

That’s when I touched his shoulder.

The second we made contact, his entire body convulsed. His back arched, and he screamed a guttural, animalistic sound that didn’t sound like Larry. His eyes rolled back, and his mouth poured out a stream of incoherent curses. And yet... he still stared at that damn light.

My brain went on autopilot. I grabbed my phone and dialed emergency services. The line buzzed once… then crackled with static.

And then—nothing. It cut out.

No signal.

In the middle of downtown.

My heart pounded. My ears rang. Then—

Darkness.

Total. Crushing. Unnatural.

The kind of darkness that doesn’t feel like night—it feels like *absence of life*. The room, the phone, the broken ramekin—everything was gone.

“Larry?” I whispered, my voice barely holding steady.

Nothing.

“Larry? …Larry?”

I called out, louder now—shaky, scared.

“Hello?! Where are you?”

My voice cracked mid-sentence.

“What the fuck is happening?”

I reached out instinctively, desperately.

But there was nothing. No ground. No air. Just endless, suffocating emptiness.

And then, I saw it.

I raised my head.

The light still hovered in the dark, exactly where Larry had seen it.

But it was barely glowing now.

It didn’t chase away the dark—it *became* part of it.

Still. Silent. 

Wrong.

It didn’t shine like it used to. The glow was uneven, flickering like a dying ember in a breeze that wasn’t there. It pulsed gently, not with the rhythm of electricity, but something more organic… alive. The edges of the glow weren’t sharp or defined—they bled outward in tendrils, curling into the darkness like smoke under water.

As I stared at it, the more and more confused I was, it wasn’t casting light. Not really. It wasn’t illuminating the space—it was *consuming* it. The shadows weren’t retreating from it; they were drawn toward it, as if magnetized, as if worshipping.

And then it blinked.

Just once.

Slow and deliberate.

That’s when I realized—it wasn’t a bulb anymore. It was an eye.

Pulsing. Watching.

I felt it in my bones before I understood it in my mind. That thing wasn’t human. Or a animal. Or *of this world*. It radiated hatred… but also curiosity. Like a child playing with a bug, unsure whether to observe it or tear off its wings.

And just as suddenly—it vanished.

Silence fell again, until I heard it: Scratching. Chattering teeth.

I followed the sound blindly until I stumbled into the living room.

There he was.

Larry.

A silhouette crouched in the shadows, scratching at himself like he was trying to peel off his own skin. His arms dripped blood like leaky pipes. His teeth ground together so hard I thought they’d shatter.

When our eyes met, he smiled—wild and unhinged.

“I found it,” he said. “The perfect *high*. It took everything, Ruby. But it was worth it.”

He laughed then. A childlike, *gleeful* laugh.

“I’ve seen Nirvana. The real kind. I climbed mountains no one else has. I touched the corners of something *older than time*. I alone... have *been* there.”

Then he said something that chilled me to my core:

“We got there together, Ruby.”

Larry and I have known each other since we were kids—since the night his parents disappeared and he landed in the first of many foster homes. We survived hell together. We grew up holding each other's hands like it was the only anchor we had.

When he started using, I didn’t leave. I believed him when he said, “I’ll change, Ruby. We’ll get there together.”

But this time… I don’t think he’s coming back.

Update:

After we made it to the hospital, Larry was admitted under psychiatric hold.

Or… that was the plan.

I’d barely finished signing paperwork when I turned to ask a question and he was gone. No one saw him leave. No security footage. No alerts. Just gone—like he was never there.

That was two days ago.

His blood is still on my living room floor. I haven’t had the nerve to clean it. It feels… wrong. Like scrubbing it away might make whatever’s happening worse. Or maybe it’s the last piece of proof that what happened was real.

No police have come knocking. No follow-up calls from the hospital. It’s like the world shrugged and let him vanish.

But last night—just after midnight—my kitchen light flickered back on

And there’s an odd blink to it.
