I found teeth in my grandfather's ashes.

I need you to understand that before I tell you anything else. Before I explain how I got here. Wherever here is, some facility with white walls and doctors who look at me like I'm made of glass. Before I tell you about the ship, about the crew, about what happened to them. I need you to know that I found teeth in my grandfather's ashes. Small ones. Too many of them. And they weren't his.

The tapping hasn't stopped. Even now, as I write this, I hear it. Small, patient. Like something knocking on the inside of my skull, waiting to be let in.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. That's what the doctors say I do. They say I need to start at the beginning, that writing it down will help me "process." They don't know what they're asking. They don't know that some things can't be processed. They can only be survived. And surviving, I've learned, is not the same as winning.

My grandfather taught me that.

Let me start where it actually began. Not in space, that came later. It started in a room that smelled like antiseptic and old flowers, with my grandfather dying in a bed that seemed too small for the man he used to be. 

There's a photo my grandfather kept on his mantle until the day he died. In it, I'm seven years old, holding a garter snake I'd caught in the backyard. My smile is so wide it looks painful. The snake is coiled around my wrist like a bracelet, and I'm presenting it to the camera like a trophy, like proof of something.

"That's my Eli," he'd say whenever someone noticed it. "Afraid of nothing."

And for a while, that was true.

I was the kid who picked up beetles and let them crawl across his palms while other children shrieked. The one who climbed to the highest branch of the oak tree in Mrs. Patterson's yard just to see if I could, never once considering what would happen if I fell. I chased other kids around the playground with earthworms dangling from my fingers, drunk on the power of their disgust.

I remember the feeling of it, that reckless, stupid bravery. It buzzed in my chest like a second heartbeat. Every scraped knee was a badge. Every close call was a story. I threw myself at the world with both hands, certain it would catch me.

My grandfather loved this about me. He'd watch me scale fences and jump from heights that made other parents gasp, and he'd just shake his head with this look on his face, pride, yes, but something else too. Something I didn't recognize until much later.

Envy.

He was already old by then, though I didn't think of him that way. To me, he was just Grandpa, solid and permanent, smelling of pipe tobacco and old spice, with hands like leather and a voice that could fill a room without raising above a murmur. He'd served in Vietnam. He had a Medal of Honor in a glass case in his study, though he never talked about it unless I asked.

And I always asked. "Tell me about the war," I'd beg, curled up on his lap or sprawled across the floor of his study. "Tell me about the time you saved everyone."

And he would. God help me, he would. The stories varied in their details but never in their shape. There was always a patrol. There was always an ambush. Chaos, gunfire, men screaming in the dark. And in the center of it all, my grandfather, calm, clear eyed, impossibly brave. He carried wounded soldiers through enemy fire. He held the line when everyone else ran. He made impossible shots, impossible choices, and somehow, impossibly, he walked out alive.

"The rest of my unit didn't make it," he'd say, and his voice would go soft in a way that made my chest hurt. "But I got home. I got home so I could meet your grandmother, so you could be here right now. That's why we fight, Eli. So the people we love get their chance."

I believed every word. Why wouldn't I? He had the medal. He had the scars, a puckered line along his ribs, a starburst on his left shoulder. He had the nightmares too, though I wasn't supposed to know about those. Sometimes I'd hear him through the wall between our bedrooms, crying out in words I didn't understand in a voice I didn't recognize. 

In the mornings, he'd make pancakes and ask if I wanted chocolate chips or blueberries, and neither of us would mention what I'd heard. That was the deal we had, the unspoken contract of our household. He gave me stories of heroism; I gave him someone who believed them. He gave me a childhood; I gave him absolution.

I didn't know that's what it was back then. I didn't know I was forgiving him for things I couldn't imagine, things he couldn't name. I just knew I wanted to be like him when I grew up. Brave. Steady. The kind of person who runs toward danger instead of away from it.

I wonder sometimes if that's what broke me. Wanting so badly to be something I was never meant to be. I don't know exactly when that kid disappeared. It wasn't sudden, not like flipping a switch. It was gradual, like watching a photograph fade in sunlight until you can barely make out what used to be there. The first nightmare came when I was twelve.

I don't remember what I was dreaming about, only the waking. The sudden, gasping return to consciousness, heart slamming against my ribs like it was trying to escape. I tried to sit up.

I couldn't.

My body was locked. Frozen. I could feel the sheets against my skin, could see the familiar shadows of my bedroom ceiling, but I couldn't move. Not my arms, not my legs, not even my head. I tried to scream and nothing came out except a thin, reedy whine that didn't sound human.

That's when I saw it. There was something in the corner of my room. Just a shape, really, darker than the darkness around it, like someone had cut a hole in the world. It didn't move. It didn't have to. The wrongness of it radiated outward like heat from a fire.

And I knew, with a certainty that went deeper than thought, that it was watching me. That it had been watching me for a long time. That the moment I'd caught it looking was the moment everything changed.

The paralysis broke. I screamed, really screamed this time, and my grandfather came running, and when he flipped on the light the corner was empty. Just my desk, my bookshelf, my collection of baseball caps hanging on hooks.

"You were yelling," he said, his voice rough with sleep. "Nightmare?" I wanted to tell him about the figure, about the paralysis, about the crushing weight on my chest. But looking at him standing there in his old Marine Corps t-shirt, still solid and steady despite his age, I felt ashamed. So I lied. "Yeah. Just a nightmare."

He sat on the edge of my bed. "Want to talk about it?"

"No. I'm fine."

He studied me for a long moment, then nodded. "Alright. But Elias? There's no shame in being afraid. Fear keeps you alive. It's what you do with it that matters."

I nodded, but I didn't believe him. Because the figure came back the next night. And the night after that. And soon it wasn't just the figure, it was the walls closing in, it was suffocating, it was dying over and over in the space between sleep and waking.

By the time I was fourteen, I'd developed what the school counselor called "an overactive imagination." I saw threats everywhere. The check engine light in my grandfather's truck meant we were going to crash. The cough from the kid two desks over meant I was going to catch something fatal. Every time a teacher called on me, my throat would close up and my heart would pound so hard I could feel it in my teeth.

"What are you so afraid of?" my grandfather asked once, when I couldn't make myself walk into a school assembly because there were too many people, too many variables, too many ways something could go wrong.

I didn't know how to tell him that I was afraid of everything. That fear had crept into me like water into a crack in concrete, freezing and expanding until it broke me open from the inside.

I didn't know how to tell him that I woke up most nights at 3 AM with a weight on my chest, convinced I was dying, and that sometimes when I closed my eyes I still saw that shape in the corner, not watching anymore, just waiting. So I just shrugged and said "I don't know."

And he looked at me with something in his eyes that might have been recognition, and he nodded slowly, and he said, "Well. We'll figure it out." We never did. I want to describe this in a way that makes sense, but the truth is that anxiety doesn't make sense. It's not rational. It's not proportional. It's a broken alarm system that never stops ringing, even when there's no fire.

There was a girl in my junior year of high school. Her name was Maya, and she had curly hair and laughed at my jokes and once touched my arm in the cafeteria line and I thought about it for three days straight. I wanted to ask her to prom. I had it all planned out, the words, the timing, the backup plan if she said no.

I never did it. Every time I got close, I'd feel this surge of panic that made my vision swim. I'd imagine the rejection, not just the word "no" but the look on her face, the way she'd tell her friends, the way everyone would know I'd tried and failed. The fear of failure was so much worse than failure itself could ever be, but I couldn't make myself understand that. I'd freeze up, make an excuse, walk away. And then I'd lie awake at night replaying the moment, hating myself for my cowardice, which only made the next attempt harder.

She went to prom with someone else. I didn't go at all.

By my twenties, I'd learned to manage it, or at least to hide it. I got a degree in accounting because accountants sit in quiet offices and don't have to give presentations. I found an apartment close enough to my grandfather's house that I could walk there, which was good because driving made my hands shake. I told myself it was because the roads were dangerous, that statistically speaking cars were death traps, that my caution was just common sense.

I told myself a lot of things.

The truth was simpler and harder: I was afraid. All the time, of everything. I was afraid of being seen, of being judged, of being found wanting. I was afraid of the phone ringing, of emails with urgent subject lines, of knocks on the door. I was afraid of crowds and silence, of open spaces and enclosed ones, of the dark and sometimes even the light.

I tried therapy. Three different therapists, actually. They all said variations of the same thing: breathe through it, challenge the thoughts, expose yourself gradually to what scares you. They gave me worksheets and acronyms and exercises that worked for about fifteen minutes at a time. They prescribed medication that took the edge off but left me feeling like I was watching my life through a window instead of living it.

None of it fixed the fundamental brokenness at my core. That certainty, deep and immovable, that something was wrong with me. That I was built wrong. That the fearless child who'd caught snakes and climbed trees had been an imposter, and now the real Elias had emerged, the coward, the failure, the disappointment. My grandfather never said he was disappointed in me. He never had to.

He started forgetting things when I was twenty-six. Small things at first, where he'd put his keys, whether he'd taken his pills, what day the garbage went out. I told myself it was normal. He was eighty-three years old. Everyone forgets things at eighty-three.

But then he forgot my name. It was a Thursday. I'd come over to help him with his grocery shopping, the way I did every week. He answered the door and looked at me like I was a stranger, and for a long, terrible moment, I watched him search for recognition that wouldn't come.

"Eli" I said. "It's Eli, Grandpa."

Something clicked behind his eyes. He smiled, but it was wrong, too wide, too desperate. "Eli" he repeated, like he was testing the word. "Of course. Of course. Come in." The doctors called it vascular dementia. They said it would be slow, then fast, then over. They said to prepare myself.

How do you prepare yourself to lose the only person who ever believed you were brave? I moved into his house for the last six months of his life. Took a leave from work that became permanent. Stopped leaving except for essentials. My world shrank to the size of that old Victorian with its creaking floorboards and its smell of pipe tobacco that lingered in every room even though he hadn't smoked in years.

Some days he was almost himself. Sharp, present, full of stories. On those days, we'd sit in his study and he'd point to the Medal of Honor in its glass case and tell me about the war, the same stories I'd heard a hundred times, and I'd listen like I was hearing them for the first time because maybe I was, maybe each time he told them they changed a little, grew a little more heroic, a little more impossible.

Other days he didn't know where he was. He'd call me by names I didn't recognize, Danny, Lee, a Vietnamese name I couldn't pronounce, and talk to me in urgent, terrified whispers about things that made no sense. Tunnels. Smoke. The sound of crying in the dark.

On those days, I'd hold his hand and tell him he was safe, that he was home, that whatever he was remembering couldn't hurt him anymore. I was lying. But he didn't know that. And neither, really, did I.

It should have made me feel useful. Instead, I felt like I was watching a building collapse in slow motion, powerless to stop it. The night he died, he was lucid. That's the cruelest part, I think. The disease gave him back to me just long enough to say goodbye. Just long enough to tell the truth.

He was in his bed, we'd moved it downstairs to the study, surrounded by his books and his medals and his photographs, and he'd been asleep for most of the day, his breathing shallow and uneven. The hospice nurse had been by that afternoon. She'd taken me aside and told me it would be soon, probably tonight, and that I should say whatever I needed to say.

So I sat with him. I held his hand, that leather tough hand that had caught me when I fell from trees, and I talked. I told him I loved him. I told him I was grateful. I told him I was sorry I hadn't turned out the way he'd hoped, that I wasn't brave like him, that I'd let the fear win.

And then, around midnight, his eyes opened. Not the vague, unfocused look I'd grown used to. This was sharp. Present. My grandfather, the real one, looking at me from a long way away.

"You're a good boy, Elias," he said finally. "Better than me."

"Grandpa…"

"They gave me a medal for surviving." His voice was flat, emotionless. "You know what happened to my unit?"

I shook my head.

He closed his eyes. When he spoke again, his voice was different. Younger, somehow. Like the words were coming from a place he'd locked away for fifty years.

"The stories I told you. About the war. About the ambush, the patrol, the medal." He swallowed hard. "They were lies, Eli. All of them."

I went cold. "What do you mean?"

"We were on patrol. Jungle outside of Da Nang. There were nine of us. We got ambushed, NVA, came out of nowhere. Williams, he was our squad leader, he tried to get us to fall back, but we were surrounded. The shooting started and I just... I ran."

He paused, his breath wheezing. I wanted to tell him to stop, that he didn't need to do this, but something in his expression kept me silent.

"I found a crater, probably from a mortar strike, and I dove in. Just pressed myself into the mud at the bottom. I could hear them screaming. Williams. Martinez. Jackson. All of them screaming for help, for cover fire, for *something*. And I just laid there with my face in the mud and my hands over my ears, praying it would stop."

"Grandpa you don’t have to-"

"It did stop. Eventually. The shooting stopped and the screaming stopped and everything got quiet. I stayed in that crater for six hours, too afraid to move. When I finally climbed out, they were all dead. All eight of them."

Tears were running down his weathered cheeks now, cutting pale tracks through the yellow tint of his skin. "I walked back to base alone. Told them we'd been ambushed, that I was the only survivor. They called me brave. Gave me a fucking medal. But the truth is, I was the only one who survived because I was too much of a coward to die with them."

"People say the last survivor is the strongest," he continued, his grip tightening. "They say you have to be tough to make it out alive. But that's bullshit. You know who survived? The weakest. The ones too afraid to stand and fight. The strongest died trying to save us. The weakest lived long enough to regret it. I spent fifty years trying to believe my own bullshit," he said. "Told myself I was brave. Told you I was brave. But the truth is, I'm a coward. Always have been. And cowardice, Eli-" His breath rattled. "-it's hereditary."

The medal, he said, had been a mistake. A clerical error, a miscommunication, a story that got twisted in the retelling. By the time anyone realized what had actually happened, it was easier to let the lie stand. The war needed heroes. The country needed heroes. And my grandfather needed to be able to look himself in the mirror. I started to pull my hand away. He held on. He was crying now. So was I.

"I'm sorry," he said, so quietly I almost missed it. "I'm sorry you're like me. "I'm so sorry. For all of it. For what I did. For what I passed on to you. For what's coming."

"What do you mean, what's coming?"

But his eyes had already slipped closed. His grip on my hand loosened. And an hour later, just before dawn, he stopped breathing.

I sat with his body until the sun came up.

I didn't cry anymore. I didn't feel anything. There was a numbness spreading through me like frostbite, killing everything it touched. The grandfather I'd known: the hero, the legend, the bravest man in the world, had never existed. He'd been a story. A comfortable lie I'd spent my whole life trying to live up to.

And now the lie was dead, and the truth was all that remained. Cowardice is hereditary.

I went through his things after the funeral. His will left everything to me, the house, the truck, his savings. And one other thing. His final wish was to have his ashes scattered in space.

I laughed when I read it. Actually laughed, alone in that empty house, because it was so impossibly absurd. My grandfather, who'd barely left the state in fifty years, wanted to go to the stars. It felt like a joke, like one final lie, like he was still trying to be someone he wasn't even in death. But then my uncle called.

My uncle Richard worked for a private aerospace company, something in management, important enough that he had pull but not important enough that I understood exactly what he did. He'd always been the successful one in the family, the overachiever, the one who'd escaped our small town and made something of himself. We spoke maybe twice a year, usually on holidays.

But he was the one who called after the funeral. "I saw dad's will. The space thing. I can make that happen."

"What do you mean, you can make that happen?"

"We've got a research mission launching in three months," Richard said. "Nothing major, routine maintenance on a station in high orbit, some scientific experiments. I can get you a seat. You could bring his ashes, scatter them out there. Give the old man his final adventure."

I almost said no. The word was right there, ready to fall out of my mouth. But then I thought about my grandfather's confession, about the fear that had consumed both our lives, about that terrible word: hereditary. And I thought: maybe this is my chance. Maybe this is how I break the cycle.

"There would be other people on the ship?" I asked, hating how small my voice sounded. "Professional astronauts?"

"The best," Richard assured me. "A full crew. Four trained astronauts. You'd basically be a passenger, just there to complete your grandfather's wishes. They'd handle everything else."

I closed my eyes. I thought about the boy who'd caught snakes and climbed trees and thrown himself at the world with both hands. I thought about the man who was afraid of everything. I thought about my grandfather, bleeding out in a ditch, listening to his friends die, and surviving anyway.

"Okay," I said. "I'll do it."

The night before I left for training, I went through my grandfather's study one last time. I'd been avoiding it, too many memories, too many lies, but there were things I needed. His Medal of Honor, which I planned to bring with me. Some photographs. The urn containing his ashes.

The urn was heavier than I expected. I almost didn't open it. What was there to see? Ashes were ashes. But something made me do it anyway, call it morbid curiosity, call it a premonition, call it whatever you want. I unscrewed the lid and looked inside. Gray powder, fine as sand. That's what I expected. That's not what I found. There were teeth in my grandfather's ashes.

Small ones. Too small to be his, these were the teeth of children, of teenagers, of people who had died young. And there were so many of them. Dozens. Maybe more. Scattered through the gray like bones in a graveyard. I should have stopped then. I should have called someone, told someone, done anything other than what I actually did.

Instead, I closed the urn. I put it in my bag. And I told myself it didn't mean anything. I told myself a lot of things. That night, I dreamed about the shape in the corner of my childhood bedroom. And somewhere, very far away, I heard tapping.

The training facility was in Nevada, a sprawling complex of hangars and simulators and dormitories that looked like it had been built during the cold war and never updated. My uncle had pulled strings to get me a spot in an accelerated program, six weeks instead of the usual six months, which meant I was behind from the moment I arrived.

The other trainees looked at me like I was a joke. And honestly? I was. They'd spent years working toward this. I'd spent years avoiding the outside of my apartment. They could recite emergency protocols in their sleep. I had a panic attack the first time they put me in the centrifuge.

But I made it through. Barely. The psychologist who cleared me for the mission noted "significant anxiety markers" and "possible dissociative tendencies" but ultimately signed off because my uncle's company was footing the bill and I wasn't technically a crew member, just a passenger. A warm body with an urn full of ashes and a rich relative.

I didn't meet the actual crew until two days before launch. They'd been training together for eight months by then, a tight unit with their own rhythms and inside jokes and unspoken hierarchies. I was an intruder. An afterthought. The civilian they had to babysit while doing their actual jobs.

First was Edana, the pilot. She was thirty-four years old, with dark hair she kept cropped short and eyes that seemed to be permanently narrowed, like she was always squinting into a headwind. She'd flown combat missions in the air force before transitioning to the private sector, and she carried herself with the coiled energy of someone who'd learned to turn fear into fuel. When she walked into a room, the room noticed. She shook my hand with a grip that was just slightly too firm.

"Elias. Heard about you." Her tone made it clear what she'd heard wasn't flattering. "Ever been in space before?"

"No."

"Ever want to go to space?"

"Not really, no."

She almost smiled. "At least you're honest. Most tourists pretend they're excited. Just follow instructions and don't touch anything without asking."

That was Edana. Blunt, abrasive, and utterly unwilling to pretend things were better than they were. Most people found her difficult. I found her exhausting in a way that felt almost familiar, like looking at a photograph of someone I used to be.

The fearless kid who picked up snakes. The one who charged headfirst into danger. She'd been like that once, I suspected. Maybe she still was. And I hated her for it, just a little, because I'd lost that part of myself and she hadn't. It should have made me angry. It should have made me want to prove her wrong. Instead, it made me feel exactly as small and worthless as I'd always suspected I was. I spent the first three days avoiding her, pressing myself against walls whenever she walked by, making myself as invisible as possible.

But avoidance is impossible in space, and eventually I learned that Edana's anger wasn't really about me at all. I didn't find out about her brother until later. His name was Alexei. He'd been a pilot too, not as good as Edana, but good enough. Eleven months before our launch, his plane had gone down during a training exercise. Mechanical failure, they said. Nothing anyone could have done.

Edana didn't believe that. Edana believed someone had fucked up, maintenance, an oversight, and that her brother had paid the price for their incompetence. She'd spent months trying to find answers, filing complaints, demanding investigations. When none of that worked, she'd signed up for this mission.

Next was Dr. Marshall, the medical officer. He was fifty-one, soft spoken, with kind eyes behind wire rimmed glasses and the sort of patient demeanor that made you want to tell him things. Not in a pushy way, he never pried. He just... listened. Really listened, in a way that most people don't. He shook my hand gently. "Don't worry about Edana. Her bark's worse than her bite. Well, usually."

"I heard that" Edana called from across the room.

Marshall grinned. "How are you feeling about the flight?"

"Terrified" I admitted.

"That's normal. I was terrified my first time. Still get nervous, honestly. But that's good, it means you're taking it seriously. Fear keeps you sharp." 

That's what my grandfather used to say. It didn't comfort me then either. "I've been reviewing your file, I hope you don't mind."

"My file?"

"Medical records. Psychological evaluations. The notes from your training." He held up a hand before I could protest. "Standard procedure for any crew member. I need to know what I'm working with in case of emergencies."

I felt my face flush. All my failures, documented and quantified. Panic attacks: seventeen. Dissociative episodes: three. Recommended for mission: marginally.

"So you know I'm a mess" I said.

"I know you're struggling," he corrected gently. "There's a difference." He leaned forward. "Elias, I've spent twenty years studying how people respond to extreme environments. You want to know what I've learned?"

I nodded, not trusting my voice.

"The people who do best in crisis situations aren't the ones without fear. They're the ones who've learned to function despite it. Fear is just information, your brain telling you to pay attention. The question is what you do with that information."

"And what do I do with it?"

He smiled. "Right now? You freeze. You retreat. You assume the worst and act accordingly." He paused. "But that's a learned response, Elias. Which means it can be unlearned."

I wanted to believe him. God, I wanted to believe him so badly. But I'd heard versions of this speech from three different therapists, and none of them had been able to fix the fundamental brokenness at my core.

"What if it can't?" I asked. "What if I'm just... like this?"

Dr. Marshall was quiet for a moment. Then he said: "My daughter was born with a heart defect. Spent the first three years of her life in and out of hospitals. The doctors told us she might not make it, that we should prepare for the worst." He took off his glasses and cleaned them on his shirt, a nervous habit, I'd later learn. "She's sixteen now. Plays soccer. Drives her mother crazy. Every day with her is a gift I didn't think I'd get."

"That's wonderful" I said, unsure where he was going.

"It is. But here's the thing, I spent those three years making deals with God. With the universe. With anyone who would listen. I said: if she lives, I'll be a better person. If she lives, I'll dedicate my life to helping others. If she lives, I'll never ask for anything again." He put his glasses back on. "And when she got better, I kept those promises. Went into aerospace medicine so I could help people in impossible situations. Every patient I treat, every life I help save, it's part of the bargain."

“A deal?"

He laughed, but there was no humor in it. "That's what I do, Elias. I make deals. If I work hard enough, bad things won't happen. If I prepare enough, I can prevent disaster. If I'm good enough, the universe will be fair." He shook his head. "It's not rational. I know that. But I can't stop doing it. It's the only way I know how to cope."

I understood that too. The desperate need to believe that effort could prevent catastrophe. That if you just did everything right, you'd be safe. Dr. Marshall believed in me. Really believed in me, in a way that felt almost painful. He saw something in me that I couldn't see in myself, some potential, some strength, and he kept trying to coax it out.

"You're stronger than you think," he said to me once. "You're here, Elias. Whatever brought you here, whatever you're running from or toward, you made the choice to show up. That counts for something."

I wanted to tell him that I hadn't chosen anything, that I'd been pushed and pulled by forces beyond my control, that I was only here because I was too afraid to say no. But the way he looked at me made me want to believe him instead. That was Marshall's gift. He made you feel like you could be better than you were.

I wanted so badly to be the person he saw.

I wanted so badly to deserve his faith.

Over the following weeks, Dr. Marshall became my anchor. He checked on me every day, not with clinical detachment but with genuine warmth. He listened when I needed to talk and sat in comfortable silence when I didn't. He taught me breathing techniques that actually worked, and when I had panic attacks, which I did, twice, he talked me through them with steady patience.

"You're going to be okay," he told me once, his hand on my shoulder while I gasped for breath that wouldn't come. "This will pass. Everything passes."

Dr. Marshall believed in bargains. He believed that if you were good enough, careful enough, devoted enough, you could negotiate with fate. That there was a deal to be made, a price to be paid, and if you paid it faithfully, the universe would keep its end.

He was wrong.

Naomi was the ship's engineer, and she was the hardest to know. She was forty-three, Chinese American, with long dark hair she kept in a perpetual braid and a face that gave away nothing. When I first met her, I thought she was cold, distant, aloof, the kind of person who'd rather be alone with machines than with people. I was wrong. Naomi wasn't cold. She was just... somewhere else. 

"Is she always like that?" I asked Marshall quietly.

"Yeah. Don't take it personally. She's just very focused. And going through some stuff, I think."

"Stuff?"

He hesitated. "Personal stuff. We're all dealing with something. That's why we're here instead of with our families. Easier to work on Thanksgiving than sit at a table pretending everything's fine."

I hadn't realized the launch was scheduled for Thanksgiving week. Another layer of weight I didn't need.

Naomi told me herself, on the fourth night of the mission. I couldn't sleep, the nightmares had started again, dark shapes and tapping sounds and my grandfather's voice whispering words I couldn't understand, and I'd wandered to the observation deck to stare at the stars. Naomi was already there, floating in the zero gravity with her back to the viewport, her face illuminated by the distant light of a billion suns.

"You can't sleep either," she said. It wasn't a question.

"No." I grabbed a handhold and pulled myself to a stop beside her. "You?"

"I don't sleep much anymore." She was quiet for a moment. "When I close my eyes, I see things I'd rather not see."

I nodded. I understood that better than she knew.

"Why did you sign up for this mission?" I asked. "I mean…why space? Why here, specifically?"

She turned to look at me, and in the starlight her face looked ancient. Hollowed out. Like someone had scooped everything soft out of her and left only the structure behind.

"Because down there hurts too much" she said simply.

And then, without prompting, without any indication that she wanted to talk, she told me about her son. His name was Oliver. He was four years old. He had Naomi's eyes and his father's laugh and a stuffed elephant named Trumpet that he took everywhere. Two years ago, he'd been diagnosed with a brain tumor. Inoperable. Terminal. The doctors gave him six months.

He lasted four.

“When I sleep, I dream about him." Her voice was flat, affectless. "And in the dreams, he's always alive. Always happy. And then I wake up, and for about three seconds, I don't remember. I reach for my phone to check on him. And then I remember. And I have to lose him all over again." She paused. "So I don't sleep. It's easier."

"That sounds..." I couldn't find the right word. Horrible. Impossible. Familiar.

"The last thing he said to me was 'I'm tired, Mama,'" Naomi said, her voice perfectly level. "And I told him it was okay to rest. And he closed his eyes, and he didn't open them again."

I didn't realize I was crying until I felt the tears floating away from my face in tiny, weightless globules.

"My husband left after the funeral" she continued. "Couldn't stand to be around me anymore. I reminded him too much of Oliver. Everything reminded me too much of Oliver. The house, the city, the whole planet." She gestured at the stars outside. "So I came here. Where there's nothing to remind me. Where I can just... work. Exist. Not think."

"Does it help?"

She was quiet for a long time. "No," she said finally. "But it's quieter. The grief is still there, but it's... muffled. Like hearing someone scream from very far away." She paused. "Sometimes I forget to feel anything at all. And that's almost like peace."

I wanted to say something meaningful. Something that would help. But what do you say to someone who's lost everything? What words could possibly matter?

"I'm sorry" I said, because it was true even if it wasn't enough.

"Don't be." She turned back to the stars. "I'm not looking for pity. I'm not looking for anything. I just wanted you to understand."

"Understand what?"

"Why I'm not afraid." She smiled, and it was the saddest smile I'd ever seen. "The worst thing that could possibly happen to me already happened. Everything else is just..."

She trailed off. Naomi wasn't running from death. She was waiting for it. Patiently, quietly, the way you wait for a bus you know is coming. She'd already said goodbye to everything that mattered.

When the end came for her, she didn't fight it. She just let go. Part of me wonders if that was always the plan.

The last crew member was Captain Hesse. Captain Hesse was sixty-two years old, though he didn't look it. He had the kind of face that seemed carved from something durable: granite, maybe, or old oak. Gray hair cropped military short. Eyes the color of winter sky. When he shook my hand, his grip was firm but not aggressive, the handshake of a man who had nothing to prove. He reminded me of my grandfather in the good years, before the sickness. Steady. Unshakeable. His record was impeccable, his reputation unimpeachable, his calm so profound it felt like a force of nature. When he spoke, people listened, not because he demanded it, but because he'd earned it.

"Elias." He shook my hand with both of his. "I'm sorry for your loss. Your grandfather sounds like he was an impressive man."

"He was" I said, and left it at that.

"I've reviewed your file. I know this isn't easy for you. But I want you to know: you're not cargo. You're part of this crew, even if you're only with us temporarily. If you need anything, if you're struggling, you tell me. No shame in it. Understood?"

I nodded, surprised by the tightness in my throat.

"Good. Welcome aboard, Elias."

Later, I learned that Captain Hesse had lost his wife three years earlier. That he'd requested deep space assignments specifically because being on Earth felt like drowning in memories. That his acceptance wasn't wisdom, it was armor. A way of surviving loss so profound that any other response would have destroyed him.

He never talked about her. Not once, in all the weeks we spent together. But sometimes I'd catch him staring at a photograph he kept in his quarters, a woman with kind eyes and silver hair, laughing at something outside the frame, and the look on his face was the loneliest thing I'd ever seen.

The weeks of training passed faster than I expected.

It wasn't easy, nothing about it was easy. The zero gravity simulations made me sick. The emergency drills triggered panic attacks that I had to hide in the bathroom afterward. The technical briefings were so dense with information that my head ached by the end of each day.

But slowly, incrementally, I started to feel like I might actually survive this. The crew helped. Captain Hesse with his steady patience. Dr. Marshall with his unwavering faith. Even Edana, who stopped glaring at me quite so much after I managed to complete an emergency protocol without freezing up.

"Not bad" she said afterward, which from her was practically a compliment.

And Naomi, in her quiet way, taught me how to find peace in the mechanical rhythms of the ship. How to focus on small tasks when the big picture felt overwhelming. How to be useful, even if I wasn't essential.

We ate together, trained together, swapped stories late at night. I learned that Captain Hesse had a dog named Murphy waiting for him back home, and that he talked to it over video calls every Sunday. I learned that Edana collected vintage aviation patches and could recite the specifications of every fighter jet ever built. I learned that Dr. Marshall made terrible puns and laughed at his own jokes like a child, and that Naomi could solve Rubik's cubes in under a minute and once spent three hours teaching me how to do it (I never got faster than twelve minutes).

They became real to me. Not just crew members, not just symbols, but people. Complicated, broken, trying their best people. People I was starting to care about. That made everything that came later so much worse.

The night before launch, I almost told them about the teeth.

We were in the common room, all five of us, sharing a last meal before the chaos of the morning. Someone had smuggled in a bottle of champagne, and we were passing it around, taking small sips, saying things that felt too big for the moment.

And I almost said it. Almost said: There's something wrong with his ashes. There are teeth in them, small teeth, too many teeth, and I don't know what they mean but I think they mean something terrible. I think my grandfather did something in the war that he never told me about, something worse than running, something that left marks. And I'm scared that whatever he was carrying has attached itself to me somehow, that I'm bringing something up here that I shouldn't, that we're all in danger and it's my fault. I thought about my grandfather then. About the men he'd left behind in that jungle, the screams he'd listened to from his hiding place. About the difference between surviving and living.

I thought: maybe there isn't one.

But I didn't say any of that.

Because saying it would have meant acknowledging it. And I wasn't ready for that. I was still telling myself the teeth were a mistake, a contamination at the crematorium, something with a rational explanation.

I was still in denial.

I wonder sometimes if things would have been different if I'd spoken up. If I'd trusted them with the truth. Maybe they would have called off the mission. Maybe we would have all gone home.

Maybe they'd still be alive.
