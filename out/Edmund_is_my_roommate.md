Edmund is my roommate. That may sound bland and all, but he’s actually better than I thought. 

It started when I got kicked out of my mother’s home. My mother has always been…unpleasant, to say the least. I remember that the argument was over the dishes being unwashed. To this day, I still have no clue as why she didn’t do them. It was a long afternoon, I had just got home from work. It was maybe around 5:00 PM. I went to sleep on the couch, and awoke to tons of yelling and screaming. My mother had arrived home, and she saw the kitchen wasn’t to her liking. The main issue, however, was the dishes. I stood up to try and diffuse the situation, and she grabbed a plate and threw it over my head. I stumbled over the broken pieces of porcelain, crunching under my feet. I picked up a pot and raised my hand to bash it over her, but I never did. I couldn’t. In a defeated manner, I put it back down. She went upstairs, still rambling. I took the broom and the dustpan and cleaned what was left. 

A big factor to my mothers anger towards me was most likely my brothers death. When I was 8, he was 4. We were in the bathtub together, fresh out of swim classes. Our mother left us alone, to answer a call from our aunt. It started off as simple play, dunking our heads into the water, and splashing each other. Until, I took it way too far. I held his head under for way too long, until he stopped fighting. I thought he was playing, until he wasn’t. I let go of him, just for him to stay limp. I screamed for my mother, and she came rushing in. I can’t remember much after that, but I do know that my mother did everything to stop me from being held accountable. She told the hospital that he was alone in the bathtub, and he did it himself. They ruled his death an accident, and we held the funeral for him a week later. 

The day after the dishes incident, she burst into my room and told me I had 30 days to leave. In those 30 days, I had found elsewhere to go. It was a ran down apartment. The rent was $950 a month, which I figured was a steal. My mother was still upset at me, but she helped me move in. The first sign that Edmund was there, was on the second day. I was job searching, and I stood up for a glass of water. I ran the faucet to fill it up. I went to grab a napkin for the water I had spilt, but somehow, the water faucet turnt off on its own. 

I didn’t think much of it. I figured it was the faucet being weird. However, even stranger things started happening. I was on the phone with my friend, telling her about how much I hated when people left a mess. The kitchen wasn’t messy, but wasn’t pristine either. I went to sleep, I woke up, and saw the marble counters had been scrubbed, the stove was clean, and the fridge didn’t have any stains in it. I thought I had done it the night before and I just forgot. I laid my eyes upon a sponge I had never seen before in my apartment. It was a pink one, almost like the one my mother had when I was younger. 

What really made me start believing someone else was there with me happened on a Tuesday after work. I took a shower, and tried to lay my eyes to close. I looked for the remote to turn some sort of noise on my television, but couldn’t find it. I lifted pillows, lifted my mattress, I looked under bags. I turnt to my bed, to find it sitting there on top of my blanket. 
I found a note attached to the back of it. 

“My name is Edmund. 
I’ve been here for 20 years. 
I love new roommates, 
And playmates,
But I hate when I scare them away. 
I promise I’ll be helpful.
Please stay?”

I thought it was some sort of mental break happening to me. I looked around, and turnt every light on. I screamed his name. “Edmund? Can you show yourself please?” I repeated about 3 times. On the third time, all the lights turnt off. I couldn’t see him, but I heard him.
I swear I did. I’m pretty sure he said he doesn’t like the lights on past 9:00 PM. I ran to the bed and covered myself with a blanket. 

I woke up the next day, and saw another note on the fridge, hung by a magnet.

“I didn’t mean to scare you. 
I’m so sorry. 
I can’t talk, but I can communicate through written notes,
Leave me one when you need to. 
I’m not violent, I just appear to be scary. 
I only appear when you are not looking, 
Therefore, 
I can never show you how I look.
I look forward to this. 
Thanks for being my roommate.” 

It took a few weeks for me to get used to Edmund. He never showed himself, but I make sure to leave him a letter detailing about my day. He makes sure to reply. He’s very helpful, he cleans, he puts things away, and never leaves a mess. Even two years later, he is still very cleanly. He even checks in on me when I sleep. I think. 

Therefore, I am okay with Edmund being my roommate.
