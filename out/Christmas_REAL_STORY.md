I’m from Peru and when I was 9 I used to think that Santa Claus really existed and I will wait for him all night since I was 6, I have a sister that at that moment she was 16 she used to tell me stories about how she met Santa and ofc i believed her so it was like a motivation to keep me up and see santa.

she used to joke about me not getting presents from santa because I was a bad kid but wtv, I had a little remote car with a camera that I got from my dad as a gift, the quality wasn’t great at all (it was late 2008) 9 yr old me thought it was a good idea to set the remote car in front of the Christmas tree, the car had no system to keep the videos safe and all that stuff so I had to constantly watch in that little screen it came with 

it was 4am I was waiting for “santa” to put the gifts under the tree, keep in mind that my sister my mom and dad were completely slumped, (my family including me always had the habit to lock the doors before we go to sleep so there was 0 chance it was my family) it was 4 am and I was waiting for santa I never heard no door open or footsteps


 I was tired and my vision was kinda blurry but I locked in one last time and I saw something, he was crawling, I will never forget that, he was CRAWLING into the tree, palid face, black striped shirt like ones from prison, had no idea who was it, he stood up, it was really tall maybe 6’4-6’6, he was just standing there not a single movement, no beard whatsoever, my dumbass decided to have a look (keep in mind that I was 9 with almost no knowledge of what being scared was ) but the curiosity maked me take a look and there was nothing, the Christmas tree was empty,not a single clue what happened, my dad woke up mad ash because he felt my door open, till this day nobody believes me, I know it wasn’t a dream because the next day we were all talking abt what happened, I did my research about maybe sum type of urban legends in Peru but nothing. If yall have some type of knowledge abt this please leave me a message because I really want to know who was that.
Idk if this has something to do w what happened to my dad but he died after 2 days of what happened and never had the opportunity to ask him face to face if the house was haunted or sum shit, the house was In Lima Peru in some very strange neighbourhood called San Juan de Miraflores , very old house but never got bad vibes when I lived there. Basically my childhood house and my mom still owns the house but never came back because of the creepy funky smell that came from the basement (not like a basement but we called it that it was like a bunker with no light and no ventilation,and that we tried to fix multiple times, many insects there never had the balls to enter by myself
