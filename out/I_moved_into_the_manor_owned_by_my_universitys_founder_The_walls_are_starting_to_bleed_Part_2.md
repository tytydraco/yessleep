After the incident in the hallway, I immediately went to bed and willed myself to forget about it. My mind must’ve been playing tricks on me. That was it. I was just seeing things. I'd been under a lot of stress lately, and moving to someplace new probably just added to the mix. That was all. It was just in my head.

And it worked. The next few days passed with little issues. Sure, I had some difficulties sleeping, but of course I would. It was a new place, after all, and getting used to the barely audible groans echoing throughout the house's infrastructure was going to take a little while. Eden was also a bit weird, and I'd catch her staring at me from time to time, but it was nothing too crazy.

But that peace didn’t last for long. Just the other day I had woken up extra early, as a nightmare cut through the fog of sleep. A common occurrence for me that seemed to be exacerbated by the new environment. It was still dark out, the sun just barely making its presence known, and I decided to grab a cup of water. In the kitchen, I found Eden sitting by the table, a teacup in front of her. She looked up when she heard me enter and smiled.

"Julian," she said in that quiet voice of hers, a hint of surprise in her tone. "Good morning. I didn't expect you to be up so early." It was only then that I realized she was wearing pajamas—a simple white gown that seemed almost ethereal in the early dawn light. It was hard to spot her in anything besides that same, frilly blue dress from the first day, so it was a nice sight.

"Yeah, I had trouble sleeping. Nightmares." I admitted with a sheepish smile. "What about you?"

"Mm," She hummed, bringing the rim of the cup to her lips, "I don't sleep much."

"Really?" My eyebrows shot up, "Isn't that, like, super unhealthy?"

"I'm not tired," Eden shrugged her shoulders, and I found the comment exceptionally hard to believe, judging from the bags dragging her eyes down.

"Right..." I trailed off, not sure what to say next. I wanted to ask her if she had nightmares, too, but that was a little personal, wasn’t it? "So, uh, did you want me to make you some breakfast?"

Eden looked at me with those wide, blue eyes, "I can make it myself, Julian. You're my tenant. You don't have to."

"Well at the very least let me help. In return for the tea, y'know?" I gave her a big smile, and she stared at me. It wasn't long before she gave a single nod.

"Okay." And so I helped her make breakfast. I didn't really have to, honestly. Eden moved with an efficiency that was surprising, considering how sluggish she looked. I'd never seen someone chop vegetables so quickly and evenly, and the eggs were cooked to perfection.

"I'm curious, where do you get all your ingredients from? Don't see you leave the house much, and there aren't any cars anywhere." I asked as I washed a potato, bringing it close to me to see if there was anything off about it. Eden paused mid egg-beating, and I could have sworn the whites turned just a little murkier. She must have noticed my stare, because she quickly set it down and took the potatoes from me, placing them in a pot and filling it with water. It was only after she brought the wooden spoon back to her hand that she answered.

"I go out sometimes. Usually in the early morning. When there's less of a crowd." Living with Eden allowed me to pick up on a few of her more obvious habits, and one of them was avoiding looking in the same direction as me when lying. Sure, her eyes never seemed to focus on anything in particular, but she made an effort to face away from me whenever she told a white lie. I wasn't going to pry when it was something clearly personal, but food safety was another matter.

"You're not getting them from the lake, are you?" I joked, hoping she'd laugh.

She didn't. Instead, she tilted her head at me, and then at the water, her eyes narrowing. "That's silly, Julian. Vegetables, eggs and fish don't belong together. You're funny." Her response was delivered so flatly that I wasn't sure if she was being sarcastic or not.

"Ha... Yeah... I, uh, I think the vegetables are ready." I pointed at the pot, and Eden hummed in understanding. We continued to cook breakfast, and I tried not to think too much about where the food came from. As Eden set the table and placed the plates on it, however, I noticed she had given herself a much smaller portion. "Eden, you sure that's enough?"

"Yes. I don't eat much," She said, taking a seat. I took the chair across from her and looked at the plate of food. It was... I don't know, weird. Like buying food from another country and seeing how different their cuisine is. Not bad, per se, but odd. Scooping a forkful, I raised it to my mouth and took a bite. The eggs were bland, and the potatoes were undercooked. Not exactly great, but still edible.

"You know, I can pick up some groceries," I gently offered, not wanting to outright tell her her cooking was bad.

"That would be nice," I had half expected her to reject my help, but instead, she readily agreed, edging on the verge of relief. "I don't know what most people eat nowadays. I'm a bit out of touch." It was as close to an acknowledgement of her subpar cooking as I was going to get, and I was satisfied with that.

"Yeah, of course. I'd be more than happy to, Eden." As we washed the dishes, I couldn't help but let out some of the curiosity that had been building inside me. "So, uh, you mentioned you're homeschooled. But I've never seen any tutors or... Anyone else for that matter. Is your family busy or something?" She stared at me for a moment, her eyes searching my face.

"I'm self-taught," She said, after a while. "And, yes. My parents are busy." That was strange. Considering how rich this family seemed to be, wouldn't they at least have a private tutor? Or even just an adult in the house to supervise?

"Right, business and all that... It's weird though, I've never heard of the Holloway family before, yet you guys own one of the most prestigious schools in the world. What industry are you guys in?" I asked, genuinely curious. Eden stopped washing the plates, her body tensing up, and her eyes widening. She didn't respond. "I mean, everyone takes about the 'honorable Holloways', and how much they've done for the town, but I've only heard of them by name. I tried asking around on campus, and nobody seems to really know who they are. You guys must be really private. Not even Google-" The plate shattered in her hands, shards of broken porcelain scattering across the sink and clinking against the bottom.

Her hands were dripping with blood, thick, red lines running along the smooth skin, yet she didn't seem to react. "I'm sorry," Eden murmured, her voice trembling. "I... I'm sorry." The liquid seeped with the remains of the food, overtaking the egg whites and forming a pink, frothing mess.

I panicked, countless words forming in my head yet none escaping. Eventually, I managed to shake myself out of my stupor and grabbed a towel, pressing it to her palms. I was too scared to look at her face. "H-hey, it's okay, don't worry! I was just making conversation! You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to. Okay? God, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to pry." Her hands were shaking in mine. "Come on, let's sit down for a second."

I brought her to the living room, the two of us taking a seat on the couch. I held her hands and pressed the towel firmly onto the cuts, trying to stop the bleeding, and I could feel her body tremble. "Hey, hey, it's okay," I said softly, trying to reassure her. My teeth grit together. How could I have been so careless? I knew Eden was sensitive, and yet I kept asking her questions like an insensitive oaf. "Where is the..." My words died as I looked at her pale, shivering hand. More precisely, the blood seeping through the rag. At first glance, it looked like regular, normal blood. But the way it seeped out of the wound was more akin to sap, and the smell... Metallic and rusty.

She wrenched her hands back, covering the wound with a towel. "Sorry. I'm fine. I'll be fine. I have bandages. In the bathroom." Eden stood, walking towards the stairs.

"Eden, wait! Let me help you, you're hurt." I chased after her, grabbing her by the wrist. She flinched at the touch and tried to pull away.

"No. It's fine. I'm fine. You have school. Go." With one final tug, she pulled herself free from my grasp, a feat barely worth commending as I had barely applied any pressure in the first place. I stood there, frozen, as I watched her climb the steps, each one releasing a drawn out creak. I think that's about when issues started to surface, although I don't think it was related. It's not like my sleep was getting better before our little spat.

No, it was getting worse.

I stopped keeping track of how many hours I slept. Some nights I'd keep my eyes closed for a solid four, maybe five hours, and look at the clock to see 3 minutes had passed, and other times the entirety of a night would pass in a blink. I was constantly exhausted. A full night's rest felt like the pipe dream of a madman, and I was starting to lose weight. And the groans, those damned groans. They kept me up at night, and they never ceased. They got louder, and more frequent, like churning, like bubbling.

I hated it. I absolutely despised it. No matter how I tossed and turned, it never went away. And Eden didn't help either. In fact, I barely saw her anymore. It didn't help that I didn't have the strength to chase her around the labyrinth that was the manor. When she did see me, her eyes would fill with surprise at the state of my appearance, before something akin to guilt or shame flickered in her eyes. Then, she'd leave, and I wouldn't see her for days on end.

As the days went on, the bags under my eyes grew heavier and heavier, and I was starting to lose hope that I would ever get a good night's rest again.I was trapped in my bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to the walls move. I couldn't stay here any longer, I figured one night when the sounds grew especially loud. My tired eyelids struggled to keep open, yet they avoided the siren call of slumber.

A guttural rumbling rang out, the same kind that had haunted me and my sleep for the last... However many days it's been. With the last of my strength, I pushed myself out of bed and stumbled to the window, nearly tripping over the violin case on the way there. The branches that previously avoided the window were now encroaching on the glass so tightly I could see it bend ever so slightly. Not a single ray of moonlight dared to pierce through the canopy, leaving the world outside my window as black as an abyss.

Another groan, this time closer. I struggled to the wall, eyebrows furrowed, frustration mounting. What the hell was making that sound? I pressed my ear to the wall and listened. There was a squelching sound, like water being squeezed through a sponge. The smell, the one that had accompanied the liquid from the wall and Eden’s blood, was back, and stronger than ever.

The pulse of my heart matched with the rhythmic thumping of the house, beating in tandem with the walls that seemed to shift with each throb. A migraine formed in the back of my head, and I raised a hand to clutch the spot. Anger and pain mixed into a concoction of pure, unbridled hatred. My fingers dug into the dainty wallpaper, tearing into the layers, before yanking it back.

The sound that followed wasn't the one of paper ripping. No, the sound was more organic, the noise of flesh being pulled from the body, the wet sound of a carcass being split open. And beneath it wasn't wood nor drywall. It was a throbbing mass of sinew and flesh. Blue veins the size of my arm ran along the walls like a network of rivers, all pointing to the door. The moment I let go of the wallpaper to stumble back in a mix of terror and pure revulsion, the beige material sealed itself shut. What remained of the tear was a brown, rust-coloured pigment.

Like a scab.

I scampered for the hallway, nearly tripping over my feet every other step. Had my stomach not been empty, I would have thrown up at the sight, but the best I managed was dry heaving. I gripped another section of the wall, peeling the wallpaper back to reveal the same, pulsing, twitching flesh underneath. The veins led downstairs. Of course. If this house was as organic as I thought it was, then that meant it had a core, as all living creatures do.

And it was downstairs.

I descended the steps, my hands shaking. I paid no mind to the loud creaks that echoed with each step. I didn't care if Eden hear, I just needed to make the groans stop.

Once I reached the first floor, I continued to tear at the wallpaper, the veins guiding me across the living room, through the kitchen, and finally stopping in front of the door Eden had told me was the basement. It was the only room she forbade me from entering, and I had respected her wishes thus far.

But I needed to know what was in there. I needed to see. I needed to put an end to this madness, to this torture.

I tried the handle, but it was locked. Of course. Eden would have made sure to lock it. I took a few steps back, eyeing the door. Breaking it down would make far too much noise, but in my state, logic and reason were already a far-flung dream. I took a running start and slammed my shoulder against the wood, causing the hinges to squeal in protest. Again and again, I threw myself at the door, until my arm was numb and sore. The wood was starting to give way, and I could hear the lock rattling.

With one last push, the door swung open, and I found myself at the top of the stairs, looking down at the basement. It was evident that no one was supposed to see beyond this, as the thin veil of a well-kept house had fallen away and revealed the rotting carcass of the interior. A mouldy, pungent scent wafted through the air, and I could see the floorboards below me were cracked and splintered. The red mass clung to the walls and ceiling like roots on a tree, and its deep, crimson colouring reminded me all too well of the crooked branches that embraced the house.

The air was thick with copper, rust, and something distinctly sweet, like syrup left in the mouth of a corpse. The mere act of breathing felt like inhaling poison, and the damp, humid atmosphere clung to my skin. The wooden steps moaned under my feet as I descended, each one groaning beneath my weight, threatening to give way. The darkness was overwhelming, swallowing the short beam of light my phone could provide, and the smell of rot grew stronger with each passing moment. Its honesty and unabashed putridity was almost refreshing in the wake of the facade of a respectable manor, but that did little to make me feel better.

My bare foot sank into the floor, wet sludge coating my skin and clinging on as I took a step, leaving numbingly cold prints wherever I went. I pointed the light down, grimacing at the flesh that squirmed and pulsated under the sole of my feet. So fixated on avoiding any particularly deep pools, I neglected to look up at the rest of the room.

And that's when I nearly bumped into the wall. Yet, as the light rose, I wasn't met with the red mass that I had expected.

Feet. Red, sinewy flesh that erupted from the wall haphazardly, attached to legs, that were attached to a torso. And at the top, the head of a man. I fell back, my phone dropping light-side up and casting a shadow of the corpse. Its arms were spread wide, as if being crucified. All across its body, tendrils of meat and veins had spread, engulfing the room completely. I wanted to scream. I wanted to cry. I wanted to puke. But I didn't have the strength to do anything. All I could do was stare, wide-eyed and terrified, at the sight before me.

Then I looked at his face. Though lacking skin and eyes, the scar across his face and the distinctive nose gave him away. This was the man in the photo. The patriarch of the Holloway family. The founder of the University.

But that was impossible. He should have been dead a long time ago. But what I was staring at wasn't a corpse. No flies, no maggots, no rot. Worse yet, it was moving. Not with intent or purpose, but rather with a natural rhythm, as if it were alive. Breathing.

Then, I heard footsteps. My head whipped around, and I saw her.

Eden stood at the bottom of the stairs, her eyes fixed on me, wide, unblinking, and full of dread. Her hands clasped together, fingers fidgeting with each other. She didn't speak for a few moments, and neither did I. We just stared at each other, both unsure what to say. Finally, she stepped forward and yanked my arm, hoisting me up with surprising strength. I didn't resist. The cold shock of the revelation had drained all the energy I had, and I could barely move. She led me back upstairs, through the living room, and only when we reached the hallway leading to the exit did I find the willpower to pull away from her grip.

Her run devolved rapidly until she was standing, back hunched, clutching her knees for support.

"E-Eden..." I managed to sputter, "What... What the hell is going on? Who is that?"

She didn't look up. Instead, she kept her head low, her long hair covering her face. "You met my great grandfather." I was not in the mood for her vague, cryptic answers. I grabbed her by the shoulders, spinning her around and forcing her to meet my gaze. Terror, shock, and guilt all swirled in her blue irises, and the sight of it almost broke me.

"Eden," I demanded, my voice low and firm, "Answer me."

"...His name is Augustus. Augustus Holloway,” she said, voice too steady, like she was reading off a plaque. “A decorated war hero. World War I. Medals. Honors. Legacy. But he came back different. Petrified of death. He was obsessed with living on, inspiring him to become the man he was. This University, the family, all were made with the intent of being remembered… Yet, it wasn’t enough." She paused, her hands clenching into fists at her sides, her nails digging into her palms. "He needed to live on in more than just the hearts and minds of the people. So, he... Did something. I don't know what he did. I don't know. But it worked. He's alive. He's still alive." Her voice cracked, her words breaking down into barely coherent sentences.

"But he needs food. And my family provided. Servants, workers, employees... Sapped them of their essence. Fed them to him. And when there was no one left to feed on, we were next. My father, my grandparents, my cousins. And my mother… Driven by despair, she plunged into the lake one day and never emerged. The only survivor was me. He knew he couldn't kill me. Because then, there would be no one left to keep him alive." She looked up at me, tears streaming down her cheeks. "I didn't put up that flyer just because I was lonely. I did it to feed him."

My blood froze, and I pushed myself as far from her as possible, my back pressing up against the wall. "You... You what?" Eden didn't even have the decency to look me in the eyes. She just stared at her own palms, tears running down her face. "Why did you do this? Why didn't you tell me? Why did you-"

"I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. But if I didn't... If I didn't... Then I would die. Then nobody would be there to look after him. He's family. And... and family sticks together. I didn't have a choice." Her voice was trembling, her words barely more than a whisper.

"To hell with that!" I yelled, slamming my fist against the wall. The quiet groan that echoed soon after only made me more furious. "He's not your family, he's a monster! Why haven't you left already?"

"I can't. You saw it, Julian. When I cut myself, that wasn't my blood. Somewhere along the way, it stopped being mine, and became… His." Genuine remorse and sorrow dripped from every syllable. "I couldn't stand being alone anymore. I thought if I brought someone here, someone that he could feed off of instead of me, that I could have a friend. Just for a little bit. The folly of it all." She let out a weak, self-deprecating laugh. "You need to leave. Right now." I stared at her, unsure what to say. I was angry, scared, and confused all at the same time. But the one thing that overpowered it all was sympathy.

Maybe it was the fatigue, maybe it was my bleeding heart, but in that moment, I couldn't find it in myself to hate her, no matter what she did. She was just a scared girl, trapped in a living nightmare. The only reason I was even here was because she was lonely and scared. Because she wanted a friend.

"Eden, I can't just leave you here with that thing." I tried to reach for her, but she took a step away from me, shaking her head.

"No. That is my penance. You have to go. Now. While you can." Eden turned her back to me and started walking away, her head hung low and her shoulders slumped. "Just go, Julian. And please... Please, never come back." My throat tightened, and I swallowed hard. I wanted to stay, I wanted to fight, I wanted to save this girl from her own family. But I knew that there was nothing I could do. I was weak, and tired, and scared. So I nodded. She practically shoved me outside while she went to collect my belongings, returning a few minutes later with a suitcase full of my clothes and a violin case.

As she pushed them into my hands, I caught sight of her face, still twisted in anguish. My heart sank, and I opened my mouth to speak. But before I could say anything, she slammed the door shut, leaving me alone on the porch. The light of the moon cast an eerie glow on the house, and I couldn't help but feel as though the building itself was staring at me.

I took one last look at the door before turning away and walking down the steps, my feet dragging against the ground. The lake that seemed still for my entire stay rippled gently, the reflection of the moon and stars dancing on its surface.

And as if things couldn't get worse, I realized I had left my phone on the basement floor.

I didn't have the courage to turn back, so I just walked to the campus, used one of the pay phones to call my parents, and returned home, the endless barrage of questions they had regarding my appearance and sudden return not even close to registering in my brain.

The moment I reached my bed, my body finally gave out, and I fell into a deep, dreamless sleep, the likes of which I hadn't had in weeks. It was the best sleep I had in years, and if my mom hadn't woken me up at 5 in the afternoon, I was sure I would have slept for an entire day.

I can't get the Holloway manor out of my head. It's like Augustus has taken root in my mind, and I can't get rid of him no matter how hard I try. Eden is still inside there, slowly rotting in a house that has become a tomb.

I need to go back. Not just for her sake, but also for mine. My mind is plagued by nightmares. The house is calling to me, beckoning me closer, and I can't ignore it any longer.
