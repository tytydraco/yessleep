I never believed in ghosts or anything supernatural. My mom always said I had a "scientific mind," so I dismissed any talk of spirits as nonsense. But that was before we moved into the old house on Elm Street.

The house was cheap, way too cheap for its size, and we needed a place to stay. The realtor didn’t say much about it, just a few vague comments about it being "historic" and "character-filled." As soon as we stepped inside, I felt it. A heaviness in the air, like it had been empty for too long. But I shrugged it off, thinking it was just my imagination.

The first few nights were fine. It wasn’t until the third night that things started to go wrong.

I was alone in the house. My mom had gone out, and I was in the kitchen, making some dinner. That's when I heard it. A low, dragging sound coming from the basement. At first, I thought it was just the house settling. Old houses creak, right? But then it came again, louder, closer, like something—or someone—was slowly moving down the stairs.

I froze. My heart raced, but I didn’t move. I didn’t want to be the scared kid running from nothing. I told myself it was nothing, that it was just the house. But it didn’t stop. The sound was persistent. It wasn’t random. It was deliberate.

I went to the basement door, my hand shaking as I touched the cold metal of the doorknob. I had no idea what I expected to find. Maybe a mouse, or the pipes making noise. Anything to explain it.

I opened the door.

It was pitch black. The air was cold, unnaturally so, and the smell—oh God, the smell—hit me like a wall. It was stale, rotten, like something had died down there years ago.

I grabbed a flashlight from the counter and turned it on. The beam cut through the darkness, revealing the dusty old stairs leading down to the basement.

I felt a chill run down my spine. Something was down there. I could feel it, like a presence that was just watching me, waiting.

I called out. "Hello? Is someone there?" My voice cracked, a tremor I couldn’t hide. No answer.

My instincts screamed at me to leave, but I stepped forward, one foot after the other, until I was at the bottom of the stairs.

That’s when I saw it.

There, in the far corner of the basement, something was moving. Slowly, painfully slow, like it was dragging itself. A shape, a figure—twisted, contorted, like it wasn’t meant to be seen in this world.

I could hardly breathe. It wasn’t human. It was... something else.

It raised its head and looked directly at me. Its eyes—if you could even call them eyes—were black pits, endless voids that seemed to suck the light from the room. I couldn't move. I couldn’t speak. It was like I was paralyzed, locked in place by sheer terror.

Then, it spoke. Its voice was rasping, like nails on a chalkboard, whispering in a language I couldn’t understand. I don’t know how, but I felt its words crawling into my mind, leaving a cold emptiness behind them.

I turned and ran. I didn't stop. I didn't look back.

I locked the basement door behind me, but I knew it wasn’t over. That thing, whatever it was, was still down there. And now, every night, I hear it.

The dragging sound. The whispering. The crawling.

And the worst part? I can feel it getting closer.
