I signed the NDA and showed up for orientation, but something about the whole setup didn’t sit right with me. The pay was sky-high, the requirements absurdly minimal, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d stumbled into something… off. I kept telling myself it was just excitement, just desperation — but deep down, I wondered if I’d been chosen for a reason I didn’t understand.  
So, a little context on how I even got this job — and why I can’t just walk away.  
 Forty-eight dollars an hour for something so mundane should’ve been a no-brainer, but I know nothing easy comes without a price. The mine had been shut down for over twenty years. Hell, my father was fired when it closed. Last week, out of nowhere, it reopened.

When I saw the pay, the minimal requirements, and the fact that they were hiring immediately, I didn’t look a gift horse in the mouth. I applied, and somehow — unbelievably — I got the job.

The interview went like this:

“Mr. Grady, why do you want this job?”

“Well, I haven’t had income for eleven months, and I have a 4-month-old at home.”

“When can you start?”

“Monday?”

“Welcome aboard. Monday morning, 8 a.m. You’ll get orientation and your suit then.”

“Suit?”

“Monday morning.”

“Your sign-on bonus will be sent to your bank on Monday night. Fifteen hundred dollars. Write your deposit information.”

And that was it.  
 The interviewer seemed rushed, like he was checking boxes, not hiring a person. I’ve never felt so much like a quota in my life. 

But this quota just got a new job and money on Monday! 



I went home to Maggie and Shaun to tell them the good news.  
 He’s only 4 months old, and I swear he could start talking any day. There’s such intelligence in those hazel eyes.  
 Maggie, in her usual fashion, seemed focused on sketching, what I can only assume is an illustration of our cat trying to get away from the baby, while Shaun lay in the playpen, stretching his tiny nub fingers toward it.

Our home is a house my father left me in his will. It’s the only thing of real value he gave me. He had his drinking issues after the mine closed, so being a father wasn’t as important to him as the bar.

But we made this our home. There’s a warmth here that I find comforting — seeing my son try to reach the cat, hearing it purr like a vibrating phone, and watching my wife smile as she sketches the scene. I’d seen this little scene countless times over the last eleven months, always coming home feeling like a failure after interviews that didn’t go my way.  
 This time was different.  
 I came home and felt like a hero.

As soon as I stepped inside, Maggie stopped what she was doing.

“WELL! How did it go??”

I tried to play coy, put on a show like there might be bad news, but my smile gave me away like a flashlight in the woods. I chuckled with excitement.

“I start Monday.”

“Oh, Alan! That’s ama—”

I didn’t let her finish. I wanted to hug her. We held each other for what felt like an eternity, her head on my chest, the sound of my cooing son nearby.



The feeling of our cat brushing against us was icing on the cake.

This was the best feeling I’d had in a long time.

Not since that Monday morning… or maybe it all seemed so distant since that very first day.

  
  
  


Monday morning came, and you best believe I was the first one in that mobile office trailer. Fresh coffee in hand, sitting at a table, I expected to see someone by 8 a.m. 

I’d gotten there eager and an hour early, 

but the longer I waited,

 the more I realized it was just, myself with three other men.

For a mine shaft. You’d think they’d need at least twenty people. Back when my dad worked there, he was with fifty men in that same mine.

Then, before I could even spark up a conversation, our interviewer walked in, folder in hand, smiling widely.

 He pulled out an old-style projector, set it up, and killed the lights.



The projector flickered to life. 

The screen was almost **too bright**, colors saturated, with the logo of the project spinning cheerfully in the corner: **Project Deep Core**. 

A perfect circle, like a cross-section of the Earth. 

The outer ring was a dark, industrial gray, the mantle a deep red-orange gradient that seemed to glow just slightly. 

At the center was the core itself, bright yellow, almost too bright, and right in the middle were the bold letters: **PDC**.

A voice boomed, almost sing-songy, like it was straight out of a government training commercial. The humming of the projector and fanfare playing almost made it seem like a fun cartoon to watch, if not for the unsettling feeling in my stomach.



“Welcome to the PDC, we are happy partners with the United States of America, to ensure our citizens have a bright and safe future!”  
  
“Mining has been an industrial staple for Americans for generations, and now we bring it back for a new purpose: to assist our new *fully automated extraction system*. It will do the hard work, you just need to be safe in doing so!” 

I stared at the imagery as it shifted, showing five Rules, each bolded and seemingly just as important as the last. I inched closer in my seat, trying to memorize every word; I couldn’t afford to mess up on my first day.



# Rule 1 — Suit Safety

“Before entering the mine, ensure your PDC-issued protective suit is **fully sealed and intact**.  
 Follow the illustrated taping technique for gloves and boots to maintain an **airtight barrier**.

**Do not remove ventilation components while in the mine.**  
 If *any* part of your suit becomes torn, punctured, or compromised, proceed immediately to **Rule 4 protocols**.”

(Cartoon worker happily tapes his boots while a second cartoon worker waves despite an obviously smoking tear in his suit.)





# Rule 2 — Communication Line Integrity

“To keep you connected, each team member is equipped with a chest-mounted communications patch.

Before entering the mine, replace all walkie batteries and test the line.  
 Press the marked indentation on the chest patch to speak.

**DO NOT remove communication cords during a mine run.**  
 **DO NOT attempt to unfasten or extract the radio during operation.**”

(An illustrated worker demonstrates plugging in a cable, smiling even as sparks fly from another worker’s headset.)





# Rule 3 — Group Tether Compliance

“All crew members must remain connected to their designated **lead tether line** at all times.  
 Check your harness clips regularly. Never detach yourself or another worker from the group tether for *any reason*.”

(Animation shows four workers clipped together, bouncing happily down a dark tunnel that seems to breathe.)





# Rule 4 — Emergency Tether Protocol

“In the event of danger, suit breach, communication failure, or disorientation, activate the **Emergency Tether Crank System**.

Hold down the lever and press the red emergency button located beside the master crank.  
 Remain braced and hold tight — the tether will automatically **retract you back to the entrance**.”

(Animation shows a smiling worker being yanked backward at high speed while another cartoon miner waves goodbye.)





# Rule 5 — Terminal Confirmation Button

“At the end of every mine run, proceed to the **Terminal Marker Station**.  
 Press the illuminated **Confirmation Button** firmly to complete your route.”

“After pressing the button, wait for the PDC Impactor System to confirm your run:”

1. **Low mechanical rumble** — “System waking.”  
2. **Sharp metallic strike** — “Alignment confirmed.”  
3. **Deep resonance through the walls** — “Impactor cycle complete.”  

“Do not leave until all three sounds have been heard.  
 Failure to complete this step may result in **incomplete logs**…  
 and an **automatic recall of your tether group**.”

(Friendly worker gives a thumbs up as the walls behind him quietly shudder.)

Just like that, the lights flickered back on, and the image from the projector burned into my eyes. I, along with what I could only assume were three other hired men, stood up—either out of seeing the others do it, or from a small shock as the door opened. A small-statured man entered, wearing the same type of suit we’d seen in the training cartoons… only now it was real.   
  
“Hello, everyone. I am Dr. Malcolm.”

His voice sounded… off. It reminded me of a foreign actor I couldn’t place, thinner and stretched somehow, and that bothered me more than the suit. 

“These are your hazmat suits, please gentlemen, follow me we have a small locker room and equipment shed located inside the mine.”  
nervously  
“Un… deux… trois… quatre…

Un… deux… trois… quatre…

Gloves and boots, tight and sure, Four wraps make the suit secure.”

  
This song echoed as Dr. Malcolm wrapped his suit, and then he sang it each time we wrapped our own. In a matter of a few minutes, the song was stuck in my brain, like an annoying nursery rhyme.

 These three strangers and I were taped up, suited up, and now we had our tethers to secure.

I stared down at my rope and the latch I had. My suit was **number 3**, and I was looking at the indentation described in the training video.

As Dr. Malcolm checked it, I heard a **click** and the sound of someone else breathing. Then another click, another breath. And one more click.

At that moment, I realized I was hearing the sounds of my fellow co-workers—the subtle differences in their breathing, the small sighs, the clearing of throats. The static made my head feel like it would explode.

Then Dr. Malcolm pressed a knob visible on the outside of our hazmat headpiece. And just like that, the voices stopped.

“There. I made it so you press to speak. You shouldn’t hear anything until people press the button. Go ahead, press the button to speak. If anything is too loud, you can lower the gain. There’s a knob on the right side of your helmet.”

I looked around nervously and pressed the button  
“Uh, hi, my name is Alan.” 

The man in the suite number 2 presses his button. 

“Sam.”



The man in the suit numbered 1. Presses their button  
  
“Mike”



I watched the man in suit 4 as they were still getting the last boot tapped on and  tiredly pressed their button while being hunched over.   
  
“Ennnnrh my name… iss... Benny!” He said as he, just now, triumphantly got his suit fully on. With both arms in the air, now showing victory. 

 We marched into the mine,

 Mike attached the emergency latch to the entrance as Dr. Malcolm had instructed.

 We followed him like sheep being led to pasture. 

Our boots squelching under the soft almost mud, but not quite ground. 

We were all approaching what seemed to be a small electric golf cart. With extra seats in tow.   
The deeper we went, the squelch of our boots sounded unnaturally loud.

That tape song hummed behind me — or maybe inside my own head.

I looked them over one by one while we each sat in the golf cart, getting settled in to drive deeper into the mine. 

Mike number 1, he has the emergency latch, 

tethered to Sam number 2, 

and then tethered to me number 3,

 and then Benny number 4. 

  
I was nervous being first in, but I wouldn’t want to be the last either. 

As the darkness of the mine swallowed us, the main thought occurred to me, reassuring myself, at least we are not alone.
