Lately I have been revisiting an old playground horror story that’s been passing around the area where in I grew up. When I was young the older children would tell me and my friends that there was a god living in the forest.

They told us all those usual things you would think fit that description; All powerful, omniscient and so on. But they emphasized one thing that always struck me as sinister. This deity did not seek worship. That specific fact always creeped me out. That something so alien that it didn’t desire or seek a single thing, not even dominion over its subjects, existed somewhere right behind our town’s flimsy treeline.

It just rubbed me as truly foreboding. Like seeing a billboard proclaiming the military suddenly needs more troops or having a guy with no friends in sight hand you a drink at a bar. It was as if, there was some unspoken motive too horrible to flaunt out in the open lurking behind a false facade.

And what god could possibly have a secret motive darker than requiring eternal servitude?

I revisited this story because through my son, I’ve found out that the children of this town still tell each other this story. Not a single thing has changed about it either. Not a single thing. The story goes, that if you find your soul heavy with a longing, you never shared, go into the forest. And when you have gone further than you’ve ever been before, a being will have known your wish eons in advance and grant it if your souls the only one whom knows you went seeking.

Even back then I thought that it must have been made up by the older kids to get us into the forest alone. A very clever idea surely coned up by some imaginative little twerp tired of getting caught giving swirlies to us younger kids; simply wanting to get those younger kids a little further away from the prying eyes of teachers.

And of cause I’ve told my kid as much, and to obviously never go into the forest alone.

But the more I think about it though, the more it bothers me that this story is still going around. I can only remember two kids from my school ever going looking for the magic place in the woods, and none of them where ambushed by the school bullies. And you would think that a failed middle schoolers plan, to isolate some smaller kids, from over twenty years ago would, by now, have been forgotten.

So because I wanted to know more, I tried to reach out and connect with those I heard went looking in the forest back then. And one replied back to me, the short of it being that apparently one of my then friends told them about the deity in the forest. They were adamant that they told everyone that it was all bogus and that they were going in the forest to prove it. So clearly they hadn’t been the one to spread the rumor further.

I did ask what if anything happened in the forest, and they let me know in a very condescending tone that everything about their childhood walk in the forest was normal.

But having received a reason to catch up with the old mate who evidently told them the scary story, I chose to message Josh.

I do remember that he was the one in our friend group that believed the story the most, so it isn’t all that strange if he helped spread that weird story.

He was very keen to see me and talk over coffee. So I guess that’s what I’m waiting for now, I hope Josh still remembers how and to whom he told that story…
