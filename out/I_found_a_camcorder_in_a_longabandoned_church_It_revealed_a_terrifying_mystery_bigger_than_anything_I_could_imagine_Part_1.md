I live for the thrill of discovering what others have forgotten. I’d first been tipped off to an exciting new location by an estranged college roommate who shared a love for urban exploring. We hadn’t spoken in almost a decade, so it was a total surprise when he messaged me. There were no formalities, no ‘how have you been’ or ‘long time no talk’ — he cut right to the chase. 

He’d heard through the grapevine about an abandoned church nestled in the thick forests that surrounded my hometown. Few knew of its existence, and even fewer had explored it – if any at all. Despite our falling out, he said I deserve to know. In his words, “Nothing deserves to be forgotten.” It wasn’t a gift or kindness — it was a sense of duty. I understood that completely. 

Two weeks later I crested an overgrown meadow, along with two friends and my sister Megan. Together, we laid eyes upon a hauntingly beautiful structure: a gothic-inspired church with black-tipped spires and large oval-shaped stained glass windows. It was awe-inspiring and frightening all at once. 

“I can’t believe we’ve never heard of this place. Right in our own backyard too. It’s fucking magnificent. Were you able to find anything about it online?” Thalia, my on-again and off-again girlfriend remarked.

“Nope, nothing. It’s like it never existed. Looking at it now, I’m guessing it’s at least a hundred years old — *at least*. Pretty odd.” I replied. 

“Seems pretty spooky if you ask me. Isn’t this hallowed ground or some shit?” My roommate Marcus asked, half serious half not. 

“Too late to turn back now. Unless you want to be a little bitch.” Megan retorted bemused. 

“Rather be a bitch than hunted by zombie priests.”

“Zombie priests? Ok, no more horror movie binges before we go exploring.” We all laughed as I slapped Marcus playfully on the back. 

A large wooden door marked the entrance to the church. A wooden crucifix weathered by the elements hung by a thread above us. The nails fastening it to the brick had deteriorated over time, leaving it upside down. Marcus and I went to open the door, but it wouldn’t budge. Our collective weight thudding against the frame failed to generate even the slightest movement.

“It must be barricaded from the inside. This isn’t going to work, let’s find another way in.” I motioned towards the back. 

As we rounded the exterior, I noticed how quiet the forest was. It was silent except for a hushed breeze, even the birds had gone mute. 

“This looks promising. What do you think y’all?” Megan pointed excitedly at a broken window just above our heads. 

“Yeah, looks perfect. Who's first?”

“I’ll go. You know how much I like to go first.” Thalia winked seductively at me. 

We boosted her through the window and she glided through. Marcus was next, followed by Megan. Then, the two of them reached down and pulled me up. As they dragged me through the window, we lost our footing and collapsed into a heap onto a broken pew. A cloud of dust kicked up and I gagged from the smell — it was putrid. The air was musty and damp, like a wine cellar filled with spoiled food 

Clearing my head, I looked around in amazement. The interior was pristine, untouched by graffiti artists or other vandals — shockingly rare in the world of urban exploring. Not a soul had been in this church in ages. 

“Yo, where’s Thalia?”

I was so lost in my own thoughts and I hadn’t noticed she was missing until Marcus mentioned it. We’d landed in the nave, just beside the pulpit. The room was enormous, but she was nowhere to be seen. 

“Thalia! Where you at girl? You better not be getting into some shit without us.” Marcus bellowed, his voice echoing off the vaulted ceiling. 

There was no response.

“Stop messing around Thalia and tell us where you are. I’m not in the mood for you to jump out and scare us – *again*.” On more than one occasion Thalia had scared the shit out of me during our exploratory endeavors. The worst occurred in a hospital mortuary; I literally defecated that time. 

Despite my pleas, not a peep from Thalia. 

“She’s definitely trying to scare us. Let’s keep going, I’m sure she’ll pop up at some inconvenient time. That’s her specialty.” My sister was not a fan of Thalia and did little to hide it. 

We receded towards the back of the church, winding our way through dilapidated pews. Mice scurried into the shadows as we wandered. As we went further, the air became noticeably colder. 

Behind one of the last pews, a door stood ajar leading into a long hallway —  connected to several other rooms. There were no windows, so it remained dark despite the daylight hours.

“Give me your flashlight Marcus. I think I know where our ‘damsel in distress’ is hiding. Let’s see if we can get the drop on her.” 

Marcus pulled a light from his bag and plopped it in my awaiting palm. It flickered to life, illuminating the way ahead. A series of portraits lined the walls, the images shocking us.

“What in the fuck is this?” Megan took a step back. 

The pictures were gruesome, depicting all manner of ghastly, torturous deeds. Each one worst than the last, they were oil paintings of people being ripped apart by unknown creatures, gallivanting in their blood and feasting on their entrails. They were disturbingly realistic. Far from what you’d expect in a church. 

“This is some sick shit. Why do old-timey churches always have a demon fetish? This is why I stay away from Sunday services.” Marcus quipped

“This is fascinating. Consider my curiosity piqued. Let’s make sure to take some pictures, our socials are gonna go crazy from this.” I was barely listening to him.

As we made our way down the hall, I snapped photos on my phone. The flash captured snapshots in time. As my shutter clicked once more, I heard a floorboard creak from the last room on the right. I motioned for the others and put my finger up to shush them.

“I found Thalia. Let’s storm in there and give her a good scare. Paybacks a son-of-a-bitch.” I whispered. We all grinned in amusement. “All right on my count. Three, two, one, GO!”

On my mark, we burst into the room screaming like banshees. Instead of a shriek of terror, we were greeted with deafening silence. The room was pitch black, windows covered up with layers of yellowed newspaper. I shone my flashlight in a clockwise motion, settling on a figure hunched over against the far wall. It was Thalia. She was rocking back and forth with her hands covering her eyes.

“Thalia?” I squeaked. 

She said nothing, continuing to rock. 

“Thalia stop fucking around. The jig is up. You’re not gonna scare us, not this time.” Megan’s patience was waning. 

In a jerking motion, Thalia stood up, still facing away from us.  She was muttering to herself, but I couldn’t understand a word. 

“Is that…Latin?” Marcus asked with a tinge of fear. “Since when does she know Latin?” 

Almost in slow motion, Thalia's neck began to turn, but her body remained fixated in place. You could hear her bones breaking, the vertebrate in her spine coming apart at the seams. 

“What in the…”

I dropped the flashlight and screamed. Her eyes were gone and blood poured from the sockets. Face twisted in a wicked smile, she held up her hands to reveal her eyeballs perched neatly on her outstretched fingers. Before we could move, she bolted towards Marcus and sunk her teeth into his forearm. 

“Get her off me! Get her off me! It fucking hurts!”

Megan snapped into action. Fueled by deep seeded resentment and almost relishing the opportunity, she grabbed Thalia by the hair and flung her outside the room. Crumpling to the floor, she quickly rose to her feet as if elevated by an invisible string. She charged us like a wild animal. Megan slammed the door and together we held it shut as Thalia slammed into it with no disregard for her physical well-being. Her guttural shrieks sent shivers down my spine. Grabbing a chair from behind an aging desk I wedged it underneath the doorknob. Shortly after doing so, the banging subsided.

“You’ll find no salvation in my sanctuary. Only death awaits you.” A throaty whisper accompanied the sound of footsteps pattering away. 

Marcus slumped to the floor and yelled in pain again. 

“Goddamnit I hit my tailbone on something,” he cried, “Wait is that a camcorder?

Stuffed underneath an ancient canvas bag was a VHS video camera. It lay on top of a message sloppily carved into the brick. ‘*Erebus is here.’* Marcus read the words aloud, whimpering.

My chest heaved. I picked up the camera and inspected it with curiosity. To my surprise, it turned on. A grainy image appeared on the foldout monitor. It was a young man sitting in a darkened room, staring directly at the lenses. His eyes were red and dreary, darting from side to side every few seconds; he looked terrified.

“I’m the last one left. Everyone else is dead,” he uttered through sobs, “Consider this my last will and testament. A warning to anyone who finds this place…”

The tape began to rewind, the motor wheezing like an elderly steed. It cut to a group of teens dressed in flannel and baggy jeans, gazing upon an all too familiar gothic church. A shapely girl with a sculpted Afro smiled at the camera. She lifted her left hand and pretended to touch an earpiece

“This is Alicia Higgins, reporting live from a never-before documented, long-abandoned church in southern Oregon. I am keeping the exact coordinates secret for now. Once we discover the treasures surely awaiting for us inside, and have claimed them for ourselves, then this reporter will tell all. Until then, fuck off losers”

The group erupted into a fit of laughter. Breaking into a sprint, they cheerfully made their way toward the church. 

“Can you put down the fucking camera and help me out? What’s wrong with you?!?” A familiar voice brought me back to the present.

I’d completely forgotten about Marcus. Megan was holding a ripped T-shirt to his arm to stem the bleeding, which had slowed considerably. 

“This is all types of fucked up. Why did Thalia attack us like that? Did you cheat on her again or something? I told you not to get back together with her. She’s crazy man!” Marcus raged, “I didn’t even want to come today. But no, you *HAD* to convince me otherwise. Who told you about this stupid place anyways?” 

“Don’t get pissed at me. I didn’t do anything. Thalias clearly lost it, but I have no idea what could have made her act that way. You weren’t forced to come either, you’re not a child.” I responded defensively, “And if you must know, I got a message from Rick out of the blue. He gave me the exact coordinates and everything. I may really dislike the guy, but he knows his shit — never once gave me a bad lead back in college.” 

“Wait, Rick, Rick? Like *the* Rick? Your old roommate, Rick? That’s not possible bro…”

“What do you mean not possible? He literally told me about this place. You think I’m making this up?”

“I didn’t say you’re lying; I said it’s not possible.  Rick died a few months ago. He shot himself.”

I was at a loss for words. Nothing was making sense anymore. 

“Yup, I guess you’re out of the loop. It was gruesome. A shotgun to the temple. His brains splattered everywhere. Right in front of his wife too, she was covered in it. Looked her right in the eye and laughed until the end.” Marcus' tone grew sinister. “It was quite the sight. A Jackson Pollock of gore. Just beautiful, so beautiful.” He began repeating the last words over and over again. His voice transformed into something much darker. 

Without warning, he violently pushed Megan to the floor and leaped onto all fours. Barring his teeth, his eyes fluttered wide — they were bright red. The skin around them began to blacken, his veins popping from his head and darkening.

With a rabid scream escaping his lip, Marcus swung a wild haymaker and connected with my temple. The last thing I saw was his jaw chattering with rage before everything went black.
