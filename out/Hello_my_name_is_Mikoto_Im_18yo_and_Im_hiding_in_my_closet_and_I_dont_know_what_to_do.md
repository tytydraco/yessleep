Hi, my name is Mikoto, I'm 18yo and I'm hiding in my closet and I don't know what to do

Let me give you a little backstory:

I used to live with mom and dad, we were a Japanese family, everyone around us used to think that we were a happy family, but that were not true. 

My parents were fucking idiots, they used to beat me and rape me every fucking day of my life. 

For example, one day, my mom locked me in the basement for 34 hours with no water or any kind of supplies after my dad have beaten me several times with his belt.

This is just one of the awful things they did to me. 

This stopped happening about a 2 years ago, when I decide that I had enough of that. 

So... 
I killed both. 
I couldnt stop laughing to their screams while I was cutting all their members and eye balls off, that was actually funny, I felt so free while I was doing it. 

I was actually enjoying listening to the synth of their screams of agony and pain

When I finished what I was doing to them, I simply set their bodys on fire, put them in a trash bag and threw them into a river near of my house (my house it's isolated from the others, so, I could do it without anyone noticing it) . 

I called the police, after I cleaned up the crime scene, and told them that they just disappear. 

The first person that the police declare as suspicious, it was obviously me, but as I said earlier, everyone thought that we were a happy family, so I got away with it. 

1 year after, the police set the case was closed, cause the couldnt find the body's, so they just gave up, I was finally free or that was what I thought. 

My life continued, I managed to get a girlfriend and I was happy, until 2 weeks ago. 

Strange things start happening, like weird feelings, I was feeling like I was been observed in my own house, but I've just ignored it.

As time passes, more strange things happen, moving objects, shadows in the dark, scratches on the walls, noises during the night, and it was just getting worse day after day, until 1 hour ago, when I was getting ready to sleep I heard a window breaking on the main floor next the sound of footsteps. 

I went down stairs to check is going on, and what saw scared me, I saw two black figures walking like their looking for something.

I stayed calm as I watched the two shadows walk, until one of them sees me and shouts "You're going to pay for what you've done." in a demonic voice, I ran up stairs and I hid in my bedroom closet, where I am now writing this. 

I don't know want to do, pls somebody he....
