So there I was, pressing my son’s sobbing face against my shirt as I stared at the besausaged remains of my ex-boyfriend as he writhed slowly in a pool of blood on my bed, only unable to shit his pants because his intestines had been relocated outside of his gaping torso.

[He’d only been gone a couple of minutes after telling me that we had to run away from the Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12lu2yd/todays_update_my_boyfriend_has_an_unhealthy/), a group that I only knew from the fact that a man had been hiding behind the curtains in my bedroom for a length of time I couldn’t even begin to guess. 

My legs felt glued to the floor like tree trunks of liquid horror; the sight had overridden all motor control. 

Then Jordan sobbed, and everything changed. My maternal instincts overrode the most horrifying sight of my life, because nothing can compare with the fear of knowing your child is unsafe. 

I grabbed Jordan’s wrist and spun him around. Darren’s fatal mistake had been telling us to pack before fleeing; there was clearly no time for anything other than running as fast as we could. I knew that once we made it to the car, I wouldn’t stop until the gas tank was nearly empty. 

In the back of my mind, a cold voice told me that there was no hope – that They had known who we were and what we were doing for a very long time, and had attacked Darren because They had eyes everywhere. 

But that didn’t matter. I would run until I couldn’t run anymore. A world where my child is safe is the only one worth experiencing; one where he’s in danger can never offer a reason to smile. Human potential is mostly untapped, and few parents are ever forced to show their true capability. Powerful as the Order might be, they had never experienced me at my most extreme. 

We made it as far as the hallway before I was tackled.

“Just tell me why,” I deadpanned while staring at the five pale men before me. I pulled at the ropes around my wrists once more, harboring no illusions of untying myself, but hoping that I could get at least some circulation to my numb fingertips. “Why do you need my son?”

The man in the middle glared at me with ice-blue eyes that would chill my core if he were staring at me from the other side of a bar. “He’s the One,” the man replied in a voice that was both too high and too low at the same time.

“What the fuck does that mean?” I huffed, struggling not to hyperventilate. “You do know that this is fucking insane, right?” 

We carry around an underlying belief that the world has at least *some* reason guiding it, and that each of us has a glimmer of that reason connecting any member of humanity to every other. That illusion died as I gazed at each man, realizing that they truly believed kidnapping my son was a sensible decision.

“We’ve traced his blood,” a second man offered in a voice that sounded like it was coming from a deflating tire. “Sacrificing him is our obligation.”

The hyperventilation won as I flung myself against bonds that only tightened in my panic. “PLEASE!” I screamed. “If his blood is so important, take me instead! I share his blood! TAKE ME INSTEAD!”

I didn’t expect it to work.

But their way of thinking is something I will never understand. My comprehension doesn’t matter, though; each life is a series of choices, and in the end, each person will be reduced to nothing more than dust and the choices they can no longer un-make. 

“You understand the arrangement?” a third man asked in a frigid voice nineteen hours and thirteen minutes later. 

I stared at him with a calm that came not from control, but from the fact that most of my soul had been extinguished. “At any time, I can ask to be released, under the condition that my son will take my place.”

He licked dry lips. “Good girl.”

“Your goal is not to kill me, but to keep me alive as long as possible.”

“It will be a very, very long time,” he breathed. “Most humans are incapable of fathoming the quantity of physical pain that the body can endure.”

I stared back in unblinking silence. 

“We know your blood very well, Carol. We have enough to keep you alive with indefinite transfusions.” His grin widened as he shuddered. “While it’s possible for the aggregate adrenaline exposure to trigger cardiac arrest, that would take far longer that you can imagine.”

“Just stay away from my son,” I spat.

His nostrils flared. “Until you tell us otherwise, Carol.”

In yet another decision that I will never comprehend, they have allowed me to share my experiences with the public. I think they love anonymous attention. 

So here’s the conclusion of my story: as soon as I’m done writing this, my “ungluing” will begin. But I’m determined to endure whatever physical pain they inflict on me: as long as I keep my son safe, my life will have been worthwhile. If I cannot, then my birth was a waste. 

“Remember that you can trade Jordan for yourself at any time.”

They keep promising damnation disguised as salvation. 

I keep praying that I will be strong and die quickly.

If all goes well, I’ll never know what happened to Jordan. Part of the deal was that they would release him on a random street. We’ve got no more family, and I don’t know who will take him in. But at least he’s alive. The rest is details. 

I have no doubt that they will find him if I break. 

And so it begins. My story is over, and the rest of my existence will be misery. If I crack and they set me free, it will be impossible to live knowing that I betrayed Jordan. 

God willing, I’ll never see my son again. 

Mommy loves you.

Goodbye.
