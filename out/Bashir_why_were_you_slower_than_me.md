why did we agree to stay out in the woods for longer than our elders told us to
why
why did it all happen for just a few measly minutes of playtime in that old rotten tree house 
it had barely been moments since the sun had set
why did it find us so quickly
why did you jump on the last few steps
you should have known it would sprain your ankle....make it harder for you to run... 
what did it want from us
we were just kids 
we wouldn't have even made for a good meal
I told you to run
run like your life depended on it
you shouldn't have jumped the steps Bashir
I heard you panting loudly as we weaved through the trees
foolishly thinking that we could outsmart it in it's own domain
for minutes I heard the sound of wood being scraped as it's ghastly nails clawed on the trees
it didn't need to do that, it could have gotten to us without making itself known
but
it wanted us to know where it was
the sharp scraping kept getting closer
and louder
and faster
until 
I stopped hearing you pant
I heard a softer scrape
but I never heard you fall
the bastard didn't even let you hit the ground
why
WHY
WHY DID I LOOK BACK
TO SEE IT'S TIGHT AND TATTERED LEATHERY HIDE
FAR TOO SMALL FOR IT'S SIZE 
TEAR MORE AND MORE AS IT HELD YOU BY YOUR NECK
TWITCHING WITH GLEE
WHY DID I HAVE TO SEE IT DRAG YOU AWAY 
SLOWLY
IT WAS TAUNTING ME
IT LOOKED AT ME WHILE HOLDING YOU ON ITS LONG GHASTLY CLAWS
WERE YOU NOT ENOUGH FOR IT

.
.
.

I walked my way home, hoping it would take me too
but it never did 
why
back then I didn't understand why it spared me
I wish it hadn't 
.
.
.

I met my parents at the tree line
why were they standing right next to yours
why did they not have a son to hug that night...
the police went in the next morning 
they found your shoes
your clothes 
but not you
maybe because it didn't want *them* to see you
I went back there for the next 2 weeks, stayed there till the hour....until my parents begged me not to
they could not bear to lose me as your parents lost you
I wanted to listen to them
but something told me

it wanted *me* there 

it wanted me to find you
I was the only one who could know
what it did to you
every night in the tree house
every time
at that hour
the bugs and birds would stop at once
even the wind and the trees were petrified
as if the forest was playing dead.
but it never showed up
.
.
.
until today.

far before the hour, sun far above the horizon
at the edge of the tree line 
it was waiting for me
it didn't care about being seen

it wanted to be

as it stood between the trees
staring at me with its large glassy eyes
all I could think was
why
.
.
.
why
why was it wearing your skin...
it was torn and stretched over its lanky, boney frame...
it was clearly too small for it...
