Yes, I know. It’s been three months since my last update, and I’m sorry.

In my defense, things have been weird. Really weird.

Roger left me.

Just looking at that sentence… well, it doesn’t look right. I never imagined that would happen to us.

Things have changed so drastically!

Let me bring you up to date…

I couldn’t convince Roger to go back to the antique store with me, and he didn’t want me to go either, but I went anyway.

I did at least convince him to go back to the house with me, and he reluctantly pried the nails from the milk door so I could retrieve the bell. I didn’t bother mentioning that it was the first thing I heard when we walked in -- just ringing away!

I gathered the rest of the items I’d purchased and headed toward the lake, rehearsing what I’d say to the owner.

When I pulled up, Handsome was on the front steps sunning himself. I swear he was smiling at me.

“Where’s your mother?” I asked him.

I opened the door and he went in ahead of me. I headed toward the counter, but there was no one there.

Handsome was meowing at me from a doorway behind the counter. Of course, I followed him.

I peeked my head inside to find a small, 1950s-era kitchen. The owner was sitting at a chrome and Formica kitchenette, drinking tea.

She smiled at me. “I don’t accept returns.”

I was taken aback. “Now listen, I --”

She put her palm up to interrupt, then gestured toward a chair at the table. “Why don’t you have a seat?”

I stood for a moment, incredulous and a bit dumbfounded. “Fine.”

“Would you like a cup of tea?”

“No, thank you.”

She giggled. “I’m Miriam, by the way. And you are?”

“Jeanine,” I said curtly.

“I understand that you’re upset, but those items were meant for you. I knew what you were looking for.”

“I was not looking for haunted trinkets, and I’m pretty sure there’s a ghost in my house!”

“But you were looking for *more*,” she said.

“What is that supposed to mean?”

She leaned forward and rested her chin on the palm of her hand, looking directly at me. “Are you happy?”

“What? No, I just told you --”

“Before you visited my store?” she interrupted.

“Will you cut the theatrics? This is ridiculous. Of course I was happy! I have a wonderful husband, a beautiful house, a lucrative career, I --” I couldn’t name another single thing.

“That’s all?” she asked. “No children, no pets, no family, no social circle? Just the same spreadsheets, day in and day out? Wondering what you and the husband will have for dinner?”

How did she know about the damned spreadsheets?

She took my hand. “I know you’ve been feeling that there must be more to life than the one you’ve been living.”

I burst into tears. She was absolutely correct.

“Shh, there, there.” She slid a handkerchief across the table. “I’m just trying to show you that there *is* more.”

“I don’t understand,” I said, dabbing tears away.

“When we leave this earth, we don’t cease to exist. But we can get stuck -- much like we can get stuck while we’re here.”

“You mean I could get stuck looking at spreadsheets for eternity?”

She laughed. “Not exactly, but you can get stuck looking for meaning if you don’t find it while you’re here.”

It was the saddest thing I’d ever heard.

“So, you think ghosts are just people stuck in the afterlife, looking for the meaning of life?”

She leaned back in her chair. “Sort of. It’s all about unfinished business, really. Regret. They didn’t apologize to someone; they didn’t confess their love to someone; they never found the meaning of *their* life. There’s no one-size-fits-all meaning of life. It’s all a personal journey -- your soul’s purpose.”

I sat with this for a few minutes, my head reeling.

“I don’t know what to do,” I said quietly.

“Something different.” She shrugged. “I can’t tell you that part. It’s your journey.”

Handsome jumped into my lap. He was purring. I always wanted a cat, but my parents didn’t want pets in the house. Roger didn’t either.

“He likes you. You know, he’s not actually a very friendly cat -- believe it or not.”

I looked down at him. “I don’t believe a word she says about you. You are innocent of any and all accusations,” I joked.

“He needs a new home.”

I looked at her, puzzled.

“I’m sick. I won’t be able to take care of him.”

“I’m so sorry to hear that!” Tears were beginning to well up again.

“It’s okay, really! I’m at peace with it. I’ve lived a very fulfilling life.”

We sat and talked for hours. She told me many stories of her travels, her relationships -- both romantic and platonic. She is a fascinating woman.

We talked about the antique store. Miriam started to see spirits at a very young age. She knew that I could see them too, but I needed to make myself more open to it.

Miriam understood that spirits could attach themselves to objects, so she began collecting them to try to help the spirits move on. Not everything in the store is haunted. She keeps those items in the back.

She has no paperwork on the bell, but from what she can feel, it belonged to an elderly English woman who lived a very lonely life.

“The incessant ringing is annoying. I agree with you. I tried removing the clapper, but that obviously didn’t work. She’s just lonely and probably misses Handsome. They spent a lot of time together.”

“What does she look like?” I asked.

“No idea. I only see her shoes!”

“Oxfords! Very sensible!”

We got a good laugh from the story I told her about the night I saw them.

“I normally don’t accept returns, but you can leave the bell if you’d like.”

“No, she can stay with us -- and Handsome. I’m taking him home.”

I arrived at the house a bit after 7 p.m. Roger was waiting for me.

“I was about to call the police! You’ve been gone for ten hours! Why didn’t you answer your phone?”

I stood in the doorway holding the cat carrier.

He pointed to it. “What is that?”

“So, we have a cat now, and I have so much to tell you. You should probably open a bottle of wine.”

“You brought a cat home without discussing it with me?”

“Yes, because you would say ‘no,’ and that wasn’t an option.”

I set the carrier down and let Handsome out. He and Roger stood staring at each other. “Okay, well you make friends while I get the rest of his things from the car.”

I set up his litter box and showed him where it was. He used it right away. I set up his food and water. He ate and drank. He’s so smart, and I could tell he felt right at home.

I left him to explore while I poured myself a glass of wine and set the bell on the end table next to the couch. I fluffed up the pillows.

“What is going on?” Roger asked, as he was about to sit in the spot I’d reserved for The Englishwoman.

“No, not there. Come sit over here, please,” I said.

He looked at me strangely as I pulled out a seat from the dining room table.

I started to tell Roger everything. He wasn’t looking directly at me while I spoke. He focused on the wine he swirled in his glass. He wasn’t asking any questions either.

I blurted it all out and finished with, “I know this sounds insane, but --”

“Ya think?”

I hung my head. That hurt.

“So, you’re unhappy with our marriage?”

“That's not what I said! That's all you took from everything I just told you?”

“Yes, you feel unfulfilled. And YES, it all sounds insane!”

It turned into an argument. I won’t bore you with the details.

It ended with, “I’m going back to the hotel.”

He left. That was three months ago. He’s staying with a friend now.

His things are still here. He stops in every once in a while for clothes, or just to see how I’m doing. I know he cares about me, and I understand this is all a lot -- but the cat is staying, and so is The Englishwoman.

She’s around. I can hear her shoes on the hardwood floors. I’ve seen them on the floor at the end of the couch -- Handsome curled up where her lap would be. The bell rarely rings. She has company. She’s not alone.

I caught Roger trying to sneak the bell out of the house. Handsome alerted me by howling so fiercely it scared Roger enough to drop it on the floor.

I don’t know if we’ll reconcile. I want to and I miss him terribly, but I’m living *differently* now. I guess it’s up to him whether he can accept it.

I’ve started volunteering a few nights a week at the YWCA, and I’ve made some new friends there.

I visit Miriam every Sunday for tea. She’s in good spirits! We pick an item each week and try to figure out who’s attached to it and how we can help them move on. I feel that we have helped, but this is getting long and that would take a while to explain.

Sometimes I bring the items home. I’ve also started browsing thrift stores and I’ve visited a few estate sales. Things are accumulating -- I’m actually opening a little shop of my own. I’m so tired of spreadsheets.

I feel my life has a little more purpose now, and I really needed that.

Don’t be afraid to visit when I open up shop! I won’t send you home with anything you don’t need. ❤️
