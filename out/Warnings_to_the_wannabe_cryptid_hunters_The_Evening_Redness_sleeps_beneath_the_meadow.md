The wind was picking up outside, howling as it swept down on the roof and rattling the window frames. 

"I'm not going to make this your problem," Jacek told me. "I do believe I know who did this. And I will take care of it, I promise—we both can, together, if you want. But I don't think it's an immediate concern."

"I can't deal with that right now," I confirmed. "You think that's okay?"

"Pretty sure. You know, I'm surprised your father never questioned his… his *angel*," he remarked. "Kinda almost makes me feel bad for the guy. Like, he just wanted that to be happening so badly."

"Just say it. My folks are fucked up."

"Well…"

I sighed. "I'm starting to think it's like a curse or something. We're all either chronically unlucky or batshit crazy or just plain assholes. Would really be best for the world if there weren't any more of us floating around. Here's hoping my sisters are normal, at least."

"We could invite them over sometime," Cas prompted, giving me what he likely intended to be an encouraging smile. "Sure they'd be glad to catch up."

"Right," I muttered. "We can throw a goddamn party."

After trying and failing to comfort myself and each other, Cas and Jacek then went off to bed. That left only me awake, sitting on the living room couch and absently fumbling with the tv remote. I should have probably done like the boys and at least attempted to get some rest, but something told me I wouldn't be able to lie still anyways. Better to keep my mind occupied. 

The knock at the door didn't draw my attention immediately. It took two, three louder bangs for me to perk up and make my way over to the door. Hope sparking in my heart, I opened it to find tell-tale locks of red shine out from the darkness. 

"So… I hear you were looking for me," the woman began, unbothered enough by the storm and the cold to give me a self-satisfied smirk. "Looking to make a deal, perhaps."

"Correct." I moved aside, motioning for her to come in. "This isn't a permanent invitation into my home, mind you. Just for tonight."

"You seem to be fond of things that last only one night," she commented, winking as she stepped inside. "But I catch your meaning."

"The Bannik says you could help me contact the sleeper under the red meadow."

She shrugged. "I might. What are you looking for, exactly?"

"Anything that'll help me communicate with that thing. I need to get on the same level with it, and no matter how I'm gonna do that, it needs to happen *soon*. There's not much time," I explained, hoping she wouldn't pry. 

"Well, then you must be very glad I came," she remarked, leaning forward to reach out and touch my cheek. Her fingers ghosted over the side of my face, gentle to a fault, but I brushed them aside when her thumb came to rest against my lower lip.

"Not quite *that* glad," I answered.

She drew away, her lips pursing. "Too bad."

"Hey, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't be opposed, but there's kinda someone I've got feelings for."

"Would they mind?"

"Pretty sure he would."

"Shame. Anyways, I have something for you. But just so you know what you'll be receiving… It's a blend of herbs. You'll need to smoke it in a pipe or something of the sort. It will induce a trance that should put you on the same plane of awareness as the Evening Redness. I won't deny that it could end up not having the desired effect, but overall, I trust in my handiwork, as may you." She looked at me with clear, bright eyes. At the very least, she appeared to believe what she said.

"So I'll basically pass out? When am I going to wake up again?"

"To be frank, it depends. You'll have to find a way to break out of the state on your own. Of course, that means you will be taking a risk, but let it be known that my creations have yet to kill anybody. Then again, no human has ever consumed these goods."

"Not really selling me on this, I gotta say. I appreciate the honesty, though."

She nodded. "Naturally. I'm not one to deceive when it comes to my dealings. Mislead, maybe, but only occasionally and not in your case. I've been told about what's at stake."

"And you'd still recommend I take my chances with this blend of yours?"

"Definitely. It's your only chance, at any rate. And if you trust me to, then I'd be glad to stay and watch over you while you're in trance. If push comes to shove, I could attempt to wake you."

I took a deep breath. "Okay. Yeah, that sounds doable."

"Great! You won't regret it. Probably."

"You want something in return, though, don't you?" I crossed my arms. 

The redhead gave me a faltering smile. "I do."

"Well? What is it?"

"Don't… don't let the Beast encroach upon our land. That's all I can ask for. All I *will* ask of you."

"I'll do what I can."

"No; no no, I'll take your word for it. Don't try, don't do what you can, simply do it. We know you can."

I swallowed. "You're right. I will."

"Then will you go with me and take the blend?" she asked.

"Right away? Yes, I-I guess that'd be best." My gaze flitted to the staircase. No time. I hastily grabbed a pen and paper to jot down a short note. 

*In case something happens, I love you.*

"Mkay. Ready. Where are we going?" 

"It'll be more… fruitful… to conduct it outside. The cold doesn't bother you, according to the Bannik?"

"Not most of the time, no."

"Good. Then." She opened the door, extending her other hand to me. "Let's head out."

The wind was whistling through the house for the brief moment in which the door was open. I was quick to follow her outside, shutting it behind my back and straightening up. The redhead immediately began trudging her way through the layer of snow covering the ground. Her tracks were almost instantly covered again; it was hard to see ahead through the white flakes whirling around us and landing at our feet. The woman's hair was as a torch in the night. She had set a punishing pace, and while I didn't have trouble keeping up per se, I could sense the urgency in every one of her steps. 

"Do you have a name?" I called out against the wind that carried her scent back to me. Rosemary and honey. The same fragrance that had already caught my attention that night in the sauna.

"Sure," she yelled back. 

"Will you tell me?"

"You know I won't!"

"Worth a shot!"

Her laughter cut through the howl of the storm. As we neared the edge of the woods, I noticed the outline of an enormous creature silhouetted against the already pitch-black sky, just a little darker than the shadows. 

*"Well-met, Fiona."*

The Leshy's voice droned across the field like a thunderclap, the sound weirdly comforting. I smiled up at him, wondering if he could see it. "I'm glad you're here, Aleksei."

He knelt down, glowing eyes lowering themselves to my level. His snout puffed clouds of heated breath into the chilly night air, bathing me in warmth as it drew closer. For a brief moment, I placed my palm on it in greeting. "I'm guessing you already know what I'm about to do," I began. 

*"Yes. And it causes me great unease. First Arek…"* He trailed off, tone laced with hurt—an ancient sting of grief that had never healed. *"Now you."*

"It won't be me," I told him. "Whatever happens, I'm not going to go out like Arkadiusz." 

*"Liar. How can you know?"*

"I don't. But I'm hoping."

*"Then hope is all there is?"* Aleksei's voice was sharp and icy. *"Pure optimism is the only security I can expect to receive, the only thing assuring me that your fragile life is not going to end tonight?"*

I turned to the redhead. "I thought the drug was safe?"

She nodded. "As safe as such a concoction can be."

The Leshy growled. *"It's not merely the blend I worry about. What will happen once you are on the same wavelength as the Evening Redness? I've told you what the sleeper did to your ancestor. There is no guarantee your mind will remain intact during such an encounter; you will be communicating with something incomprehensible, something entirely unnatural… You will be offering yourself to the entity that drove the strongest man I have ever known into a frenzy, that drove him to end his own life!"*

"Aleksei…"

*"What state will you be in when you emerge from slumber? Will you even know who you are? Who I am?"* 

I rolled my lips together. He sounded like he was scolding me, but there was a frantic undertone swinging along, urgent, afraid… almost desperate. "There's no other way," I said softly. He fell silent, letting out another long huff of air, almost like a sigh. 

"You know there's no other way, right?" I repeated, reaching out once more to touch his snout. He pushed it into my palm with such force that it nearly sent me staggering back.

"I'm doing this for the woods."

*"You are."* He slowly stretched his limbs, lying down in the snow. I knelt down in front of him, watching as his form began to shift and warp until the bearded man was sitting before us. His face was a set mask, but there was a twist to his lips and a tremble in his brow that he seemed to be unable to suppress. He couldn't hold my gaze. Averting his eyes, he pulled out his pipe, handing it to the red-haired woman. "Fill it with your poison, fairy," he ordered. "And be careful about it, if you know what's good for you."

She took it, visibly biting back a comment at his commanding tone. She reached into her satchel and began to dutifully stuff the pipe with what I assumed to be the blend in question. I took a deep breath, no longer able to ignore the rapid beating of my heart. "I guess this is it then. I'm gonna meet the sleeper."

Aleksei grunted. "Don't you dare feign enthusiasm."

"Hey, I need to do *something* to handle the anxiety," I argued. "Besides, who's to say that it'll go wrong? This might end up saving our asses."

He rolled his eyes, giving me a snort. "It might not. It might get you killed. And I know what the alternative entails—it simply doesn't make the prospect of seeing your blood spill any more appealing."

"You know, there was a time when you probably wouldn't have had as much of a problem with that."

"I would have never taken any pleasure in it. Maybe I would have been more indifferent, but… well. Fiona, there's… there's an understanding between the two of us, isn't there?" 

"An understanding?"

He sighed deeply, like a kindergarten teacher might at a rather slow child. "I find you foolish and bordering on insufferable, and surely you'll never forgive me for how I used to delight in terrorizing you, but… you live for my woods. You find comfort among the trees, *my* trees, you would give yourself to preserve them. This part of the world is ours and ours alone. I'm very happy that you are the one I'm sharing it with right now. What you're about to do is dangerous, and you have been exposing yourself to all these threats for far too long. Please know that if things were different, if our roles were reversed and you weren't the replaceable mayfly that you unfortunately are… if the woods could live on without me, then I would do this in your stead."

"Okay, replaceable mayfly kinda hurt but—"

"I didn't intend it to."

"I know. And I know what you're saying," I replied.

"It's ready," the redhead announced, handing me the lit pipe. I took it with trembling fingers.

"Let me guard your sleep," Aleksei said, prompting me to nod. Rising to his feet, he stretched his arms over his head, flexing his muscles and straightening his spine. He began to shift shapes once again, tufts of brown hair shooting out of his skin, all around his face and neck. His nose lengthened and turned into a wide, leathery snout. A large bear was standing in front of me, gazing down on me with distinct kindness. I crawled up to the foot of the nearest tree as the fairy sat down beside me. I slowly raised the pipe to my lips, closing my eyes as I took a long drag. The fumes I inhaled weren't at all what I expected—an almost sickly sweet taste filled my mouth, penetrating my senses and clouding my mind in an instant. My eyelids suddenly seemed to be made of lead, weighing too much for me to keep them open.

Instinctively, I fought the daze; fight-or-flight kicking in as I felt my limbs grow weaker, my whole body involuntarily relaxing. Fear crept into my chest, but the natural surge of adrenaline that would have gone hand in hand with such a panic never came. I couldn't move anymore. My hand fell limp, the pipe rolling down into the snow. The fairy leaned over me, her face a pool of mixed expressions—concern, doubt, and strongest of all, hope. She gently grabbed both of my wrists, placing them in my lap. 

"It's alright," she whispered, voice barely audible against the whistling wind. "You'll make it."

She drew back, and I took note of the Leshy in his newly adopted form approaching. He carefully lowered himself down over my lap. His warm weight came to cover my feet, legs and waist with his back leaning to mostly cover my upper body. Somehow, he didn't crush me. A wave of calm washed over me at the sensation of unnaturally silky fur brushing against my skin. I finally allowed my eyes to fall shut as the whirling snowflakes seemed to blur into an endless stream of white, giving in to the push of unconsciousness—letting go.

It felt like being sucked into a vortex. What little safety I'd felt when Aleksei had laid down on top of me was stripped away when I was plunged into completely different surroundings. It reminded me a little bit of the hallway between hell and the surface. There were no walls, no floors to stand on; only swirling colors that, as much as I would have liked to describe them, I didn't recognize. They were foreign, alien; unlike anything I'd ever seen. The sight was gnawing on my consciousness, forcing its way into my mind as it tried desperately to block it out. It was like seeing Nick in his own true form the first time I'd met him—an incomprehensible view with the ability to shake one's perception of the natural world. 

Trying to keep my wits about me, I decided to shut my eyes and block the invading impressions out as best I could—only it didn't work. I didn't *have* eyes. And that's when I realized it. I didn't have arms either, nor legs or feet. I was *nothing*, I didn't exist, I was a mere speck of sentience hovering around in an endless, timeless, spaceless whirl of vibration, sound and color. What if I never woke up again? What if Aleksei had been right, what if this was it for me? A cruel version of eternity. I wanted to scream, give voice to this mind-shattering dread, but I had no mouth to do so. 

Worse. I wasn't alone.

The longer I lingered, the stronger I felt the presence of another being, another some such incredible entity. I tried to spot it, somehow figure out where it was, only to feel our minds touching as I searched for its consciousness. 

Even without ears, I heard it speak. 

**Hello. You're terrified.**

The voice belonged to neither a man nor a woman, it was neither deep nor high, it simply was.

*Yes,* I responded. I don't know how, but I did.

**Because of me?**

*Yes.*

**Why?**

*I don't know what you are. Or if I'll ever get out of here. Where even are we?*

**Nowhere. Just sleeping.**

*Oh. Right.*

**You'll be alright.**

Somehow, these words made me feel immensely soothed. *Thank you. I'm relieved.*

**Are you the traveler Arkadiusz? You feel like him, but not quite. It confuses me.**

*I'm his descendant.*

**What's that?**

*Someone of his bloodline, just… further down. A child of the child of his child. And you? What are you?*

Silence. Then, **I am.**

For some reason, that was all the answer I needed. In a strange way, it made perfect sense. *Why did you kill Arkadiusz?*

**Did I do that? I thought he merely fell asleep.**

*No. You drove him mad. And then he unalived himself.*

**Drove him mad? That was not my intention. All I wanted was to speak with him.**

It took me a moment to understand what I had just learned. This entity had had no clue what it was doing when it invaded Arkadiusz' mind. *Well, shit. Okay, but why did you want to talk to him?*

**I only needed a place to rest. Arkadiusz was something special. I knew that his body could contain me, and I longed to sleep. I wanted to ask him permission to lay myself to rest in his physical form. I promised to preserve him for as long as he allowed. He would have lived for so much longer, and in perfect condition. I can do that. I would have cared meticulously for my vessel. I had no idea he would misinterpret my meaning this much. When he fell limp before me… I thought he was offering himself.**

*Wow.*

**I am… very sorry. I never wanted to destroy him. I'm ashamed to admit that I have such little knowledge of the human body as to have not realized he had ended his own life.**

*Hey, I understand! Or… I think I do. Okay, look, there's a lot I'd like to ask you, but I need you to know you're in danger. There's someone out to get you. To eat you.*

**I know. There always was. Lesser creatures have been trying to catch and consume me since the beginning of my existence. I thought I was safe here.**

*Your hiding spot has been compromised.*

**I see. That's very disappointing. It's very kind of you to come and warn me, but I assure you that I can defend myself, should the need arise.**

I felt a pang of dread. *And how would you do that? You'd… you'd end up destroying everything, wouldn't you?*

**Not quite everything, I'm sure. Only that which would get in the way.**

*That doesn't sound too promising, not gonna lie.*

**Then are you looking for another way? Do you have a plan?**

*I don't know. I thought maybe you would. There's… no chance you could channel your power, is there?*

**I couldn't; not if I were forced to emerge from my slumber.**

*So as soon as you leave Arkadiusz' corpse, you'd be completely unhinged?*

**I could certainly try to do as little damage as possible, but seeing as I couldn't even tell your ancestor has been dead all these years, I really can't make any promises.**

*Looking pretty bleak, then, huh?*

For a moment, we both remained silent. And then, I had the greatest idea ever. 

It was all so simple. There had never been a reason to be afraid. Why hadn't I thought to simply stick to my tried-and-true strategy?

I'm Fiona Novak, descendant of Arkadiusz the traveler, and I'm not scared of monsters, I fucking proposition them.
