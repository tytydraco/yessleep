I was raised in a county in northeast Georgia which, at the time, had about 2,500 people living in it. We had one set of schools for both towns in it, and none of them ever had more than 250 students in it at a time. Every single school also shared the same fleet of normal 9 buses, plus one for kindergarteners and special needs students. 

They were numbed 100 through 900, but for the younger kids, they were all assigned an animal. Each one was painted onto the side of it, and because of that, we just called them whatever animal they were assigned until we stopped using them. I don’t remember every animal, but I remember mine was bus 700, the rabbit bus.

This happened in 2012, I was in 6th grade. In my county, elementary school started at 8, middle and high school started at 7. The middle and high school were also on opposite sides of the same road, so they were picked up at the same time, and dropped off about 2 minutes apart. On my first few days of middle school, I missed the bus because my mom and I weren’t used to it yet.

My neighborhood had two spots the bus stopped at, one towards the entrance of the neighborhood, one a little deeper into it. I got on at the second one.

It was September, we were only a few weeks into the school year. I was standing at my stop with the only other kid who got on there, a girl named Clara. 

Me and Clara weren’t really friends, but we got along. We had been standing next to each other every morning since kindergarten, so it was good that we didn’t hate each other. I’m not sure how she managed it, but she had infinite energy. I don’t think I ever saw her at anything other than 100% ready to face the day ahead. Even when we lost the extra hour of sleep, (I assume) she was as ready as ever on the first day, pink Jansport backpack over her shoulders, practically giddy to get to school.

I’m still not much of a talker, but Clara made up for it by talking ad nauseam about whatever she was nerdy about at the time. The term we would use for someone like her nowadays is ‘chronically online’. Supernatural, Doctor Who, Sherlock (sometimes all at once, somehow?), Smosh, The Hunger Games. ESPECIALLY The Hunger Games, more specifically Josh Hutcherson.

I usually tuned it out, but I didn’t mind the background noise for the few minutes we stood there.

The bus normally got there about 6:25, but my mom always made me go out at 6:15, Clara would get there a few minutes later. This morning was no different. I was leaning against the tree I always leaned against when Clara got there, told me good morning, and launched into her morning rambling.

She had gotten into Harry Potter towards the end of the summer, and that obsession bled into the start of the school year. She was talking about this fanfiction or that photo edit when the bus started to slowly roll up to our stop. I thought it was unusual, Clara had only just gotten there, and the bus normally came a few minutes after she got there, but it wasn’t that weird.

What was weird was that I didn’t see the bus approach.

From where I normally stood, I could see the entire road leading out of the neighborhood, and anything entering it. Even though I was spacing off, school buses are bright and loud. They have headlights on when they drive, they have lights that flash when they pick up kids. This one was driving in the dark, with no lights on, and I didn’t see it stop for other kids.

“Did you see it stop?” I said, interrupting Clara. She looked confused, so I motioned at the bus, which still hadn’t gotten to the stop. “The bus, did you see it pick up Allie and Marcus?”

Her face scrunched in thought, before she shook her head. “I wasn’t really paying attention, but I don’t think so?” She looked at the bus, which rolled to a stop in front of us.

I know our confusion was shared at that moment, as we took in the numbers painted in black on the side of the otherwise normal yellow school bus. I know that because she all but read my mind when she said:

“000?”

It was missing something else, but it took me a second to realize. This didn’t have a silhouette of an animal on it. It was a totally plain, normal school bus. Suspiciously normal, and even I realized that in the moment.

Sometimes, when our driver couldn’t do it, another driver would drive the route for them. I was just starting to think that might have been it, until the door opened.

It opened fast, and completely silently. We could see up the three steps leading into the bus, but nothing past that. It was a complete blackness that no light infiltrated, and nothing escaped. I took a step back and looked at the windows, and like I thought, I couldn’t see anything inside.

Clara looked at me and took a step back as well. “Hello?” She called out. “Are you here to get us?”

We waited for a response. 

We didn’t get one.

“Hello?” Clara asked again.

“I don’t think anyone is gonna—”

The horn on the bus blared, cutting me off, almost sending me flying out of my Van.

“Hello?!” Clara called out again, she almost seemed frustrated. “Are you here to get us or n—”

The horn blared again, making us jump again, though not nearly as much.

I walked over to Clara, leaning in to whisper to her. “We should go.” I said, glancing at the bus. “What if this is some creep or something?”

I could tell she wanted to agree, but… “What if the actual bus comes?”

I frowned, but she wasn’t wrong. The bus could be here any minute now, and if it got here when this bus was here, we could run to it, to safety…

The horn blared again. Then again. Then again.

Then it didn’t stop.

Whoever was at the wheel was holding down the horn, letting it fill the quiet morning with harsh noise. Why wasn’t anyone waking up? No lights had turned on, no doors opened in anger at a bus driver blaring the horn nonstop. Me and Clara started to move backwards, away from it. I looked over my shoulder, my house was up a hill, and I was never a fast runner. If whoever was in there was faster than I was, I wouldn’t be able to escape.

I was just about to turn, ready to drop my bag and make a break for it, when the horn stopped.

The silence was as sudden and jarring as the horn had been. For a moment, me and Clara stood there in the quiet, unsure if we should keep trying to get away, not daring to look away from the bus in case it did anything that would make the decision for us.

Then the door shut. I heard the brakes release, then it drove away. Down to where the cul-de-sac was, past a line of trees that obscured it as it went away.

Clara and I ran towards the treeline, turning to see it turn around.

But it wasn’t there.

A few seconds later, we heard the actual bus pull up. We saw its headlights cast shadows in front of us. We could see inside it.

We must have looked as terrified as we felt, because when we got on our bus driver Mr. Levi said, “You girls alright?”

We looked at each other, I took a step forward. “There was another bus that came in before you, it was dark inside it, and it wouldn’t stop blaring its horn, and, and—”

“Woah, woah.” He waved a hand. “Calm down, take a seat. Tell me what happened.”

We sat in the front row and told him everything that happened, he had a conversation over his radio and when we got to school, we were brought to the principal’s office to tell the story again to him and a police officer. 

Then we were sent back to class.

We told all our friends, and we were expecting to hear about it on the news one day — some local pervert being busted for using an old school bus to creep on kids — but that never happened. There was never any kind of follow up from the police, or the principal, or even the bus driver. Even on the multiple times my mom called to ask, she never heard anything back.

For a week, the talk of the school was Bus 000, some people thought we were crazy, some people thought we were making it up, some people thought we were lucky to be alive. None of them had said they had seen the bus.

Then, a week later, everyone was talking about something else. Eventually, I stopped thinking about it all the time, and only thought about it some of the time. Clara went back to talking about how cute Peeta was, and all seemed normal.

Until a few weeks later, when I got to go to school late because I had a doctor’s appointment.

The next morning, when I was waiting for the bus, for the first time ever, Clara didn’t show up.

When roll call was called for our home period as she didn’t answer, there was a murmur in the room, which the teacher quickly snuffed out. 

No one ever saw Clara again. From what I remember, no one ever tried to find her. People talked about her, there were theories: her family suddenly moved, they were all killed, only she was killed, she was kidnapped.

After a while, that was what everyone settled on. Someone had come by, taken Clara, and she’d never be seen again. A tragic, cautionary tale for years to come.

I knew what happened, though. Or at least, I think I do.

When I wasn’t there, Bus 000 came back.

And because Clara was alone, whatever was driving it got bold.
