For anyone that was busy yesterday

In case anyone is wondering I'm typing this from the  security of the attic with my very first smartphone. Well, it's not mine per sae but it's mine now is what's important. 

Maybe being a bit more relaxed will let me relate myself better. I'd be a fan of that.  The past few days, even by my standards have just been odd and violent, but that part goes without saying. 

Looks like more and more people are trying to help me out, much appreciated, as always. Here is a little feedback for you. And a couple questions. 

First off, why does everyone seem to know more about this flea market than I do? I'd have thought getting things first hand from something that looked like Pumpkinhead's church going cousin would have put me at an advantage but you guys seem to know what's up better than I do. 

I'm going to hazard a guess it has something to do with the fact that there’s certain information I just can't see. That same vantablack that blocks my travels censors out all kinds of things, I'd tell you what, but you know the worst part of censorship is…

Doesn't seem to work with second hand info though (not yet anyway ) I'm chalking that up to my creator’s community college level sorcery skills. So please, if you know something I don't,  pass it on. 

Second, you guys seem to have some pretty high hopes for my morals. I expected a group of random folks to be telling me to slaughter the neighbourhood with the hero's skull for shits and giggles, but it seems things have gotten a little less edgy since the 90s. Probably not a bad thing. 


Lastly, you guys seem to think Kaz can help me out quite a bit, got to say, he did seem like fear incarnate. I'll keep that in mind. 

If I missed you, it's probably because i took your advice and I'll be getting to it in a minute. 

The headline of the past couple weeks is the entire goon  squad piling into their literal hearse and taking off. The bishop seemed to have packed a couple suitcases so I assumed I was going to have a few days at least. 

But to play it safe I spent the first day in the attic. I'm still nervous about the glance the twin and I exchanged and not about to get caught in a trap invented by paranoid parents . 

A little after one on the second night I hear what I initially think is the bishop and the 3 pawns ( better name? Worse?) . But as I focus , I hear 5 voices whispering, and most certainly sounding like nothing that stalks the night with any degree of real skill. 

A window breaks, and I smell it. 

I know most of you guys think of me as a good guy, I mean, I'm pretty sure someone is working on making a plush or a body pillow of me as we speak (I have so many questions about fads in 2024) . But there are going to be times you get a deep , uncomfortable look into the vile crap hastily sewn together that is me. 

This is one of those times. 

What I smelled was innocence. And with it, I gained an understanding. A look into what my base drive is, I'd love to say I didn't like it, to say I felt it was a vile compulsion, but the truth is, that's not how it feels. It's exciting, it's primal, and on a very real level it feeds me. 

With that first whiff , I understood innocence. It's not being perfect, or young, chaste or naive. It's complicated of course, but at its core it's doing things for the right reasons . Having that spark of human kindness, loyalty and selflessness even among flaws that may appear irredeemable to some. 

2 of those men had it. 3 of those men were acceptable collateral damage. Nothing in me, meat, cloth, or magic feels any differently. I respect you all too much to lie. 

I start to salivate, the fluid pooling and dripping out of the bottom of my ceramic head. I feel power, I feel confidence. It's dark, it's my house, they’re not demons or heroes, just meat. I can feel my body twitch and thrum like a guitar string as they come into the house one by one. They split up, trying to ransack the place as quickly as they can. 

I laugh. A clicking phlegmatic sound I find myself hoping they can hear as I run toward a vent, jumping down into it with no regard for the minor noise I make. In fact , I extend one blade and drag it along the duct. As they hear the sound I can feel their fear , I can feel where they are like a hellish radar. 

The closest to me has no innocence to him. I smell crimes committed for pure greed and rage, that doesn't matter though, I need to warm up. I've spent so much time sneaking and cowering, I need to see what I can do. 

I settle myself enough to open the vent without attracting attention. The large, mask wearing man rifles through drawers, looking frustrated as he finds nothing better than 25 year old computer errata. 

My limbs move almost of their own accord , I climb with a spider’s grace directly above the man. There would have been a million ways to drop on him and kill him in an instant. But my mind went to none of those. 

Instead, I let the ceramic headpiece unfold, thick red-grey saliva hits his the top of his mask. He jumps and turns toward the ceiling shining a high powered flashlight in my face. It doesn't matter, I know exactly where he is, and I get a giddy charge from the burst of fear that runs through his body as he sees my face. 

I let go and extend both of my blades. Nothing to hack down a demon, but stout and sharp enough to slide easily through the man's eyes, the sockets behind them, and, propelled by my momentum, the brain behind that. 

He makes no noise, but both of our bodies hitting the floor most certainly does. I rip my arms, shoulder deep in gore, out of his head and take a moment to admire the spewing cavern of his face. 

I hear another man come running,  another empty snack but I'm more than eager to whet my appetite. 

I run to the door and place my back to the wall beside it. The second man, a wiry guy in his 40s, wearing no mask but a moustache that would have been at home back in 93 walks by me and screams as he sees his compatriot. 

I walk behind him and drive both blades tip down into his Achilles tendons. Putting all my weight and strength into it, I tear upward, the blades catching flesh , tendon and fat and tearing them out as a formless lump. He hits the ground, wailing in terror and pain. 

I can hear one of the group immediately leave his compatriots. I'm angered as I feel it was one of the innocent. I take this out on the thief screaming on the ground. 

I climb his body facing the door , I'm stunned at how easy these instincts come to me, and at how much I'm loving this. 

It’s like a hard drug, it scares the hell out of me, but I need it. 

He tries to see what’s on his back, but he has no leverage to throw me off. I vent my rage by stabbing, randomly, almost playfully up and down his torso. 

By the time the last two enter, he isn't dead but he isn't coming back. I stare at the two men as I petulantly stab a last 3 times, shut the headpiece with a snap and leap with greased eel speed into a floor vent. 

They scream, at the situation, at each other, at their dying friend. And I hear the telltale noise of a gun cocking. I'm not scared,  it makes me laugh, I let the sound echo through the vents as I move randomly, stoking their fear, their paranoia.  

I stop and watch them back down the hallway from a ceiling vent. I pant with anticipation, as I confirm the innocent has the gun. I scrape the knife , herding them to the top of the stairs. The gun toting buffet fires randomly, coming no where close to hitting me. 

I move to a vent between the two, letting silence ring. Letting them ramble possible plans and explanations  to each other. 

I drop ,putting them between myself and the stairs. With no room to aim, and nerves frayed thin, the innocent man, a 23 year old single father, working 2 jobs and doing this under duress, fires rapidly and poorly. 

Soup can sized chunks blow out of his friends back as the bullets exit. I do nothing to speed the man's fate, I stand in the hallway letting the young man's shock and fear marinate his coming pain. 

He sees me and fires his 2 remaining shots ,doing nothing more than sending harmless sprays of hardwood into my mask. 

He’s stunned, but not enough to avoid making a break for it when I start a slow walk toward him, scraping one blade along my ceramic head, making a hellish screech. 

He stumbles down the stairs and I leap. I overestimate my ability and land grabbing his waist from behind as opposed to his head. 

I jam a blade into the side of his leg with the rapidity of a sowing machine, and as that steel buries itself into his flesh, I feel it, the pain of the innocent. 

I don't know if I'll be able to explain this in any way that makes sense, but I'll try. 

You know that false rush of strength and bravado you hear cocaine users rant about? That high that makes you feel you could fight and fuck all night , likely both at the same time? 

Think of that, but instead of false promises you are actually  stronger, faster and smarter, not just  a twitchy loser who isn't making sense and can't get it up. 

I roar , a sound like a rock tumbler with strep throat. He tries to grab me and throw me off, but I retract a blade and grab his hand, easily twisting the wrist to such a degree the man falls to the floor. Nothing I could do before the kickstart.  

He tries to slam me into the ground, but I drive my legs into his back, briefly lifting him up as I move both of my hands perpendicular to the ground, parallel to my legs. 

I let my legs drop to the ground, the man's body falls driving my blades through his chest, he looks to them, screaming as I find myself with the strength to throw him off of me. 

I don't want to sugar coat things, but I don't want to subject you guys to too much shit either. The next ten minutes I spent with my head unfolded eating chunks of the guy till the life finally bled from him. 

When the frenzy burned itself out, it was my turn to be startled. 

Standing in the kitchen door, leaning against the frame, holding a pistol and the phone I'm typing this on was the hero. He didn't blink, the gun didn't waver, he simply threw the cell phone to me, it was open to a blank screen with a flashing cursor. 

"You have about ten seconds to tell me something that makes me not shoot you to feel better about myself. You only get that because I know you aren’t working with the square head. " he says. 

I'll spare you the part where I catch him up via the notepad. It was tense, to the point where a shot was fired, but at the end of it all we realized , regardless of who was lying about what , we both needed a hand. 

We dragged the bodies down the stairs (mostly me, for obvious leg related reasons) , I find myself, now a lot stronger than your average person, but I can feel that power draining by the second. By my guess it'll be burned out within a day. Not the buff I was expecting. 

"I'll take care of these. That salted licorice prick isn't the only one who knows how to use that microwave.  

Listen, I'm going to call you Punch, that Allright? " the hero says taking a seat in his gore streaked chair. 

As I look around the room they did leave him 3 buckets. One contained waste, the other a pile of what was hopefully animal offal , and the third , water that wasn't much more clear than my spit. 

"Okay punch, I've been burned by supernatural shit before, but what choice do I have. You ever seen the godfather ?" He asks, I nod. 

He hands me the pistol, a large boxy black thing. 

"Then you know what to do. I don't know how long we have but if you’re planning on going to the flea market do it soon. 

Once it's go time, I'll let you know. 

And one more thing, if you have any ability to get me a burger, maybe a soda, I can honestly say I'll forgive the slaughter up there." He tries to be jovial but we’re both beyond that. 

I scavenge the cash, cell phones, and 2 more pistols from the bodies hoping it will be enough to trade for something useful. 


The next night , once dark fell I quickly looked up the address on the card (with some help from the hero. His name is Leonard for all those wondering.) And started toward it. 

From a distance I saw nothing but a vacant lot across from a flea market, which made me start thinking maybe Leo didn't know how to work the phone as well as he claimed and my destination was on the other side of the street. 

But as I got within a block of the lot, suddenly there was a building too tall to be held up by brick and mortar . Bricks of all types haphazardly put together and windows ranging from idyllic home to prison studding it randomly. Dominating the front of the building  though was a giant LED  sign flashing "Flea Market!!!" In erratic patterns. 

I make my way to a massive tinted glass door that I'm unsure I can move as the last of the innocence wore off sooner than I expected. 

But as I walk up, a smaller door , sized perfectly for me, appeared. This one I opened with ease. 

As I walked in , I suddenly felt very normal and mundane. 

Creatures, entities, ghosts,  demons, whatever you could think of , it was walking the shoddy  looking aisles, browsing,  chatting, and bargaining . Dozens of languages no human has ever spoke blended together with hundreds they have into a cacophonic din that threatened to drown out my thoughts. 

The air hung thick with a sweet smoke , lights flashed, loudspeakers screamed deals. I saw signs for weapons, food, goods, anything I could think of. But I saw something else even more important. 

"Kaz! Over here!" I scream seeing the Candyman a few dozen feet away. 

For a moment I think I have no chance of attracting his attention. But eventually he turns around and seems to laugh and shake his head as he walks over. 

He takes us into a moderately more quiet part of the flea market, all kinds of entities sit at long tables eating and conversing. We sit beside a group of purple wicked looking things eating thin strands of florescent foodstuffs with fingers that look like the fronds of angler fish.  

"You little madman. You’re actually going through with this? Do you even know where to go? What you are buying?" he asks curiously. 

"I'm a genius so I guess I'll go to weapons, and get a weapon." I say sarcastically . 

"How many weapons do you think are made for Lil fellas like yourself? No, you need an adult. I'll show where you can go make your bad decision. " I'd be more angry at Kaz condescension if he wasn't right. 

He walks me for what feels like hours to what looks like the most run down junk shop of a stall in the place. The painted sign on wood that looks it was salvaged from the titanic says "Flapp and Hyve :The Oddest Odds and Ends" . 

Behind the junk laden counter stood a massive bird-like beast. It was a deep rotten orange that reminded me of a tangerine left in a gutter. It's beak was a harsh unnatural yellow, it's eyes much too large for its skull, sat exposed and rolling about of their own accord on the top of it’s head. It was seven feet of nightmare fuel dredged from childhood memories. 

I almost mistook the second entity for a piece of junk, but who am I to judge. It was a knock off "stretch man" toy , wearing a black unitard and bloated beyond reason, it stands up and vermin scuttle from tears on its latex body. 

"Flapp and Hyve?" I say trying to start things off on the right foot. 

"We got a homunculus here Hyve, speak slowly and don't use big words." The bird says. 

"That's how I have to talk to you, but this is a customer, how can I help you? Ignore my friend, he seems to think his shining personality pays our rent."   Hyve says. 

I tell him my situation, Hyve seems to take a special interest when I mention the malignant. He scrounged around the junk and brings out two items. One is a green glass eye, about sized for a doll , the other looks like a key chain with a small decorative sword on it. 

"This eye, it'll let you go unnoticed. Not shimmering outline invisible , but unseen, unheard, and unnoticed by any sense anything has. This key chain, if you can get a malignant to touch it, I can guarantee it won't be bothering you anymore." Hyde says. There are letters on the side of the sword 'Baddar'. 

I open my bag of cash, guns and phones to a massive laugh from Flapp. 

"Shoot yourself with one of those guns, and if you survive , take that money, buy a dildo,  and go fuck yourself. Get out of my shop." Flapp says dismissively.  

There is a moment of pregnant silence before Hyve stretches out a limb faster than a cobra, and despite his five pound size the blow sends the bird crashing to the ground. It gets up, chagrined but amazingly not hurt. 

"That will be fine. My kind have been nothing but especially cruel to me , but I'm very limited in how I can exact my revenge. If you can put a scratch on any of them, that makes up for any loss of finance.

Though there is one thing you are not going to enjoy. This eye is a part, it has to be installed.  " Hyve says before leading me back into the shop. 

The room looks like a cross between a woodshop and a surgical theatre. I'm strapped , completely immobile on a dark wood table. 

Hyve brings out tools that radiate an energy that puts anything I've felt to shame. He opens my head and begins to slice, flense and form the flesh underneath. 

The pain was worse than I thought possible. Worse than trauma to the meat that makes up my internals , the tools work on a level that is beyond the physical, tearing parts of my very essence to connect with the jade eye he implants in what could generously be considered my forehead.

When I get off of the table, I do what Hyve tells me, focusing on the eye. I see and feel myself become nothing more than the whisper of an idea of a form on the material plane.  

I make my way home, casually, doing everything I could to try and get noticed to no avail. 

And that is where we are, a handful of shaky alliances , a surgery I hope has no side effects , and a key chain I've been assured kills demons. 

As always, I ask you guys, what do you think? I've got so many plates spinning right now I can only hope I'm making the right choices. 

Before I go, I want to apologise to people that have been cheering for me. I could have just omitted the details, but you guys deserve better than that. You should know who you are helping . For all you know it could be your future house I'm living in
