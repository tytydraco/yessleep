I suddenly found myself with two weeks of. We make certain parts and ship them to a different country to a different factory to put the final product together. The other factory had some equipment broke and it would take a while to fix. Thus, the sudden time off.  

I was talking to a few co-workers on the way out of work on my last day and noticed Jay had parked next to me for once. We went to high school together and had even been in the same friend group, but we didn’t hang out with each other much back then. Since we worked in different areas of the factory, we rarely had time to talk.   

“What are you doing with your time off?” He asked me with his car door open.  

“I'm thinking of seeing my grandmother this week. She lives near our old high school.” I said with a shrug.   

He raised an eyebrow as if that was a shock.  

“Really? I’m going into town too to see my sister. There is also a model train show happening this week too.”  

The best thing about being an adult is you can admit to your boring hobbies without too much judgment. Oddly enough, the model train show drew in a big crowd for the small town we were from. It’s most likely because it occurred inside a now-closed station with retired trains brought in for people to see.  

“Do you remember us hanging out on the tracks in our last year? I can still feel the bug bites.”  

Jay smiled thinking back to those days. The summer before we all moved, we spent a lot of time roaming the tracks. Sometimes we spent the night which caused us to get eaten alive by bugs a few times. Jay had been there but I don’t remember us doing much together aside from some fishing.  

“I’ve wanted to do that again for a while. I miss the good swimming spots.”  

It felt like we had been talking by our cars for a while. I didn’t like keeping him when I bet he wanted to rush home to start his vacation. But I said something I didn’t even expect from myself.  

“Do you want to this week? Walk along the tracks again I mean...”  

He looked a bit surprised at my offer. At first, he opened his mouth to refuse but slowly started to nod as the idea sunk in.  

“Yeah. Here’s my number. Let’s plan this out.”  

We quickly got each other's contact information and then started back home. Oddly enough, I thought the little camping trip might be fun. Back then I didn’t realize then how much of a mistake we were making.  

We met again on Thursday, bags packed and ready to go. We planned to stay out until Sunday. We hiked along those tracks hundreds of times with and without friends so we didn’t need a map. We both agreed on a landmark to stop and then turn back home. The weather was clear for the weekend but we would to leave early if that changed. The last thing we wanted was to sleep outside in a storm.  

Back then we had blankets, a stolen lighter, and a tarp. This time we both brought a proper tent, first aid kits, lots of water, as well as anything else we might need. It weighted us down so we soon needed to change our ending landmark by the middle of the first day. We were walking far too slowly to cover as much ground as we wanted. But the idea of this trip was to just walk along the now disused tracks and not to reach a certain destination.  

“Kinda crazy we both ended up at the same factory so many years apart.” I said as we stopped for a lunch break.  

We sat on the side of the tracks near a bridge looking off into the water below. I had a few jobs before this one. I quickly found out I wasn’t meant to deal with the general public. Some people could be far too demanding.  Doing the same thing every single day was fine by me.  

“Aside from serving jobs, there isn’t a lot around here that don’t require some college degree.” He said with a sigh thinking back to his own work history.  

“What did you do before you got hired at the factory?” I asked realizing I barely knew anything about my old lukewarm friend.  

“I was at Red Lobster for a while. I got fired.” He said and stopped to take a sip of water.  

Jay was a mild-mannered guy. He never raised his voice and did as he was told. I couldn’t imagine him getting fired for anything. Something that happened three months before he started at his current job came to mind.  

“You were behind the lobster heist?” I asked shocked.  

There had been a small news story about an employee stealing all the lobsters from two Red Lobster locations and smashing the tanks so new ones wouldn’t be brought in for a while. No one was named for the damages because, for some odd reason, no one could prove who did it.  

“It was a revolution.” He said evenly as if that wasn’t one of the craziest things I’d heard.  

I laughed until my chest hurt. He only smiled. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him laugh before. I pestered him on what he did with all the lobsters. He claimed they were in witness protection which made me laugh more.   

We didn’t cover a lot of ground on the first day, but I think the start of our little outing went alright. By the end of the day, we were exhausted. There was a lot of good clear even ground near the tracks to set up our campsite for the night. We built a small fire to cook our dinner of canned beans and spam.  

“Are you dating anyone?” I asked Jay after I carefully removed the hot cans from the fire pit. 

“Nope. Single. You’re with someone right?”  

“Yeah. We’ve been together for a few years. It wasn’t too serious to start with, but now we want to get married and all that. After we saw how much everything costs, we decided to hold off for a while.”  

Having two unpaid weeks off work wasn’t getting us any closer to our goals. But it wasn’t as if any other job paid as well as this one, even missing two weeks out of the year.   

“I don’t know how most of the people in the factory have been able to get married twice. I guess things were cheaper back then.” Jay pointed out.  

Our workplace had mostly people over the age of forty. I worried about the next five years because a lot of the older people who had been there for thirty years are due to retire taking all their experience with them. Me and Jay were one of the few younger people aside from the contract workers.  

“Crissy just got divorced right? You could ask her out. She would be great to have around if a service worker gets your order wrong.” I teased.  

We both hated Chrissy. She was the biggest Karen I have ever met. I have no idea how anyone dealt with her long enough to get married not only once, but twice.  

“I would rather scoop out my own eyes with a rusty fork.” Jay replied in such a deadpan voice it made me think he fully meant the statement.  

I laughed wishing I knew how funny he was sooner. After we went through the very slim dating options for him at work, we decided to turn him in for the night. Normally it took me forever to fall asleep but I was so worn out from the day of hiking that I passed out in minutes.  

I woke up early needing to pee. My back hurt as well as my head. The pain made me question what we were doing out here. It took a few minutes in the morning to shake off the aches and the brain fog. Jay met me outside his tent after I came back from the washroom break. He silently started to take down his tent as I brushed my teeth still feeling half asleep.  

“Did you sleep alright? I had a hard time. It was noisy out here.” He started up a conversation after his tent was put away and he helped me with mine.  

“Really? We’re so far away from everything. What noise could there be?” I asked.  

“Raccoons having relations with a dying fox. Or at least, that’s what it sounded like.”  

I snorted and shook my head. Foxes were rare around here. There were also coyotes in the area but I’ve never heard about them ever approaching humans.  

“You didn’t hear any cackling or see any weird stick people figures right?” I asked with a raised eyebrow.  

When I was about eight, I watched The Blair Witch and had nightmares about it for a full week afterward. It took a full year before I could be anywhere near the woods at night.  

“If anything like that happens, we’re out of here. I don’t fuck with cult stuff or witches.”  

“Unless they’re hot.” I added.  

He looked at me debating my point then nodded agreeing. We got packed up and ready to keep going deeper along the tracks.  

The second day we slowed down a bit because we kept stopping whenever we saw something interesting. I took photos of oddly shaped trees and long-forgotten items on the side of the tracks. We stopped near a damn under a bridge for a few hours and found a fishing line with a rusted hook stuck in a tree. I cut down the line, tied it to a stick and Jay dug up some worms. I was shocked that I actually caught a fish with our makeshift fishing pole. We let the fish go and stuck the stick with the fishing line in the dirt for the next person.  

That day was fun. Since becoming an adult, it felt like my time always had to be towards something. It was rare I could do something for the sake of doing it and without any other deeper meaning.  

“Is your girlfriend alright with you being out here for a few days?” Jay asked after our lunch break.  

“Yeah. She’s normally busy over the weekends. She’s an artist so she paints for three days straight and takes the rest of the week to recover.” I explained.  

Jay appeared impressed and interested which made me happy I could brag about the person I cared so much about.  

“Does she make a living from it? I’ve heard it’s hard for artists.”  

I nodded agreeing with him. I’ve seen how hard she’s pushed herself just to get to where she is. I regret that I couldn’t do much to support her aside from helping to buy materials.  

“She’s sold some works to local galleries and even had her own show last year. She does landscape paintings on the side and sells them at craft markets. She says she’s a failure of an artist but I’m proud of her. I could never do anything like this. I wish she could see how impressive her work is.”  

Jay asked if I had any photos of her work. I pulled out my phone and for the next half an hour I scrolled through it showing off what she's done and how many paintings I saved from the trash because she was such a perfectionist.  

“Isn’t this one upside down?” Jay asked looking at one of the more abstract paintings.  

“Uh... No. Maybe. It could be looked at sideways too...” I admitted.  

“You don’t know the meaning behind her paintings and yet you like them?” He said.  

“Art is subjective. I can like the colors and not get the message behind them.” I shrugged.  

He accepted that answer agreeing with the statement.   

Dark clouds appeared in the distance even though it wasn’t meant to rain. Thunder rumbled off in the distance but thankfully it didn’t get closer to us. If it started raining, we would need to stop for the day.  A cool breeze from the distant storm helped with the humid air. At least the bugs hadn’t been too active.  

“We should have hung out more in school.” I told him as I was carefully trying to walk one foot in front of another on the tracks.   

“Yeah.” He agreed but it sounded like he was thinking of something else.  

I bet if we had more one-on-one time together back then, we would have been closer friends now.  

“Hey. Thanks for not treating me the way the others did in school.”  

My foot slipped at his sudden comment. I stopped and looked over my shoulder at him confused about what he was talking about. Our friend group had a bad habit of trash-talking each other. I heard they had a group chat I wasn’t a part of that they all used to vent about people. I always assumed it was about other people outside our circle.   

“What do you mean? I know they were kinda snarky but we were kids. All kids are like that, right?”  

He gave me a look as if we were talking about the same thing.  

“Wait... Do you not know what happened back then?”  

I shook my head trying to think back to it. We all stopped hanging out with each other near the end of summer. I thought it was because everyone was moving on in life and for no other reason.  

“They found out I was Bi and talked shit about it for months before Jason tried to kick my ass.”  

My mouth dropped open as so many things fell into place. I’d seen Jason with a broken arm but he had said he fell off his bike. Everyone avoided the subject so I soon forgot about it. He was the leader of our small group. I bet a lot of people lost respect for him for either losing in a fight or taking his bullying too far and the friend group fell apart.  

“Dude. I had no idea.” I admitted.  

“There was a group chat....” Jay trailed off.  

“I didn’t have a cellphone or a Facebook account until after high school.”  

I can’t believe I just wasn’t aware of such a big event.  Did Jay think I was in on all of that? If he did then why did he agree to this trip with me?  

All of a sudden, he started to laugh. My face got red from embarrassment for being so clueless as a kid. This was the first time I’d heard him laugh and it was directed towards me.  

“Are you still comfortable being out here with me?” Jay asked after his laughter died down. 

The idea of him trying something didn’t cross my mind.  

“Should I be worried about something?” I half-joked.  

“No. You’re not my type.” He shrugged.  

Sure, I didn’t like guys and I loved my girlfriend but that stung a little. I shook off the feeling. 

“What is your type?”  

He paused to think for a bit and I worried he was going to say something I didn’t want to hear.  

“Tall, thin if possible, and with long hair.” He nodded.  

There were at least three guys at work that fit that description. I wondered if he considered asking them out. Personally, I would never date a co-worker but I knew some people didn’t have a lot of options.  

“Long hair on a guy? Why not just date girls?” I pointed out.  

"Because girls have different equipment. And everyone is cute with long hair.”  

That was one way to put it. I directed my attention forwards unable to think of anything to add to the awkward pause for a moment. 

“Would I be cute with long hair?” I joked trying to ease the tension.  

“Yes.” He said with zero hesitation. “Still not my type though.”  

We shared a laugh and I felt a regret building in my stomach that we hadn’t been friends before this. We could have had so many trips like this if we had just talked sooner. I had always been lacking in the friends department. It sucked one had been there the entire time.  

There was a branching path in the tracks. The left path had been out of use for so long that most of the tracks had been pulled up and missing. The right path was the one we always took. We stopped near the crossroads staring at something that made us feel scared to be in those woods.  

A headless-skinned deer had been strung up in the trees by the well-walked right pathway by the tracks.   

The sun was starting to set when we saw it. The orange light made the body appear extra creepy. A feeling in my stomach made me feel like we were being watched even though we hadn’t seen another person for the past two days.  

“What should we do?” I asked Jay.  

His normally calm expression had a hint of fear on it. We both looked back towards the way we came and up at the darkening sky.   

“There is a town on the left path. We won’t reach it tonight, but being closer to people would make me feel better. We should walk as far as we can, then set up camp for the night.  In the morning we’ll go into town and get the hell out of here.”  

That was the best option we had. Our phones didn’t have the best service out here and even if they did, I doubt the local cops would come out to pick up two scared guys because they saw a skinned deer.  

It wasn’t hunting season but some locals didn’t care. With the cost of everything going up, I bet a lot of people started hunting to feed their families. But why leave it out here? I’ve never gone hunting myself but I would have thought having a hunk of meat out in the open would attract other animals regardless if you hung it up.  

We got our feet moving down the uneven path. The dread of what we saw followed us no matter how much we mentally rationalized seeing a dead animal out in the woods.  

We walked using flashlights to guide our way until the middle of the night. Our bodies hurt and our stomachs rumbled from skipping dinner. We agreed to stop when we came across a cleared spot on the side of the path. Jay’s tent was simple enough to set it up in the dark. It was cramped but we both crawled inside not admitting out loud how vulnerable being alone would make us feel.  

We didn’t talk as we struggled to fall asleep. Every sound made small bursts of fear shoot into my chest. After an hour of lying awake in the dark tent, I spoke up.  

“I need to pee.” I stated.  

“Damn it. Me too.”  

We both got up with flashlights for the washroom break. After checking that the coast was clear, I stepped out into the bush with Jay close behind.  

We stopped and I felt his eyes on my back waiting for me to get this done and over with.  

“Can you go behind a tree or something?” I asked him.  

I saw his eyebrow raise in the dark.  

“I’m shy.”  

I hated to admit it, but I’ve always found it hard to pee with someone nearby. He sighed and listened, his flashlight beam moving around as he found a large tree to step behind.  

It’s a hard task doing your business and holding a flashlight at the same time. I ended up putting it on the ground so I could focus on the job at hand. It took longer than it should have because I kept stopping whenever I heard Jay moving around near me.  

“Hey, can we-” I started to say after I was no longer exposed.  

I wasn’t able to finish my sentence due to a very hard object smashing into my face. The back of my head cracked against the tree behind me so hard I saw stars. The blow knocked me out and at least they waited until I was zipped up to attack.  

A pounding pain woke me up. I moved to find my body on a cold dirt floor. My arms stuff and everything hurt. My head was in more pain than the rest of my body. I moved and explosions of colors burst behind my eyes. It took a long few minutes to get to my knees, my hands bound tightly at the wrists.  

“Hey...” Came a soft voice beside me.  

I looked over in the darkroom to see Jay sitting next to me. His arms were tied as well and fear was clear on his face.  My heart sank as I looked around the room to see just how screwed we were.  

The room looked to be an unfinished basement. The dirty concert walls were covered with what I hoped to be water stains. Countless candles filled the space and gave off a suffocating scent.   

Behind us stood ten figures wearing deep red cloaks, their faces hidden by darkness. In front of us was a single person in a cloak that had golden accents standing next to a large silver bowl on a tall stand. The bowl had delicate carvings of different animals encircling it. 

“Well. Fuck.” I muttered.  

My heart raced in fear as I tried to think of some way out of this. Before I could start begging to be let go, a set of hands painfully pulled my head back. The figures tried to get me to drink a strange liquid from a golden cup. I struggled and refused until they covered my nose forcing me to open my mouth to breathe.   

The liquid burned my throat as it went down. I wanted to puke it back up but they covered my mouth forcing it to stay down for a few minutes. Finally, they stepped away as I hunched over coughing and gagging. My vision blurred, and then the surroundings started to bend.  

I have no idea what they made me drink but at least it lessened the pain a little.  

They did the same to Jay then hauled him to his feet. He tried to stay in control shaking his head clear of whatever they gave us. He was outnumbered and was forced to the front and next to the silver bowl.  

I watched in horror as the leader of the figure grabbed his head to pull his head back to expose his neck as the other held his arms. He thrashed unable to get free of their hands.   

My body wouldn’t listen to me. My legs were Jello and my head spun as I sat still. I opened my mouth to call out his name finding no words.  

A long silver dagger glinted in the candlelight. I could let out a squeak of horror as the blade was pressed against my friend's throat, dragging across the flesh.  

Blood freely flowed from the wound as Jay let out a terrible garaging sound. At least the cut didn’t appear too deep. Deep down I prayed if we could just get out here, he would be alright.   

The figures started to chat strange words I didn’t understand. The blood in the bowl started to boil and the candlelight changed to a deep blue hue. The words became louder and louder, pounding into my brain. I heard another sound that took me a moment to realize I started to yell for it to all stop.  

A spark came from the wall in front of us. The cloaked figures were so focused on that they weren’t paying attention to Jay. He slammed into them getting free. The leader was next as he shoulders checked the man to the ground, the chanting lessening but not stopping. They did a poor job of tying Jay’s wrists. He snapped the ropes, getting his hands free to grab the dagger that had been dropped and sinking it deep into the leader's chest.  

My mouth fell open in shock as a tiny bit of hope came. It was gone after what happened next.  

My eyes landed on the sparks coming from the wall and everything slowed down. The sparks became colors and shapes I’d never seen before. They melted into each other drawing me in. I lost all sensation in my body. For a while, the only thing that existed was the otherworldly sight.  

A hard slap to my face brought me back to my senses. It came too late.   

Something burst out of the sparks and landed on all fours knocking over the silver bowl and spilling out the collected blood. At first, it appeared to be a thing a tall man with long black hair dressed in rags. A set of arms sprouted from his back as his face opened up. The flesh on each side spread out showing a pit of teeth. In a flash of movement, the creature skittered around on the walls and ceiling, its body shifting into different long and gruesome forms.  

Jay stayed next to me urging me to get to my feet. My body was too heavy to move. I simply could not stand up. I told him to leave but he refused.  

The creature bolted around the room, picking off the hooded figures one by one in a display of bloody cruelness. Soon, it drew its attention towards us.  

It suddenly appeared in front of us, standing tall with a human face. The dark cloth around his body moved ready to change at any moment. I looked into his eyes and fell into a deep unnatural despair. This monster was going to rip me apart and there was nothing I could do. His body lurched forwards, mouth open about to rip flesh from bones.  

Jay’s hands shot out and grabbed the creature by the face. He did something that snapped me from whatever spell the odd liquid had put me under.  

He pulled the creature's face to his own to force them into a kiss.  

I sat there, utterly confused about what I was seeing. My mind cleared up enough for my brain to notice Jay had freed my hands while the monster had been attacking the others. I started to move ready to use this chance Jay gave us.  

The creature was as shocked as I had been for a few seconds. Then it reached up to grab a hold of Jay’s face forcefully keeping them together. To my horror, thick black liquid poured from the creature’s mouth and overflowed though Jay’s mouth forcing its way down his throat. Muffled screams of pain came from him, the liquid touching his wounded throat and attacking the gash. No, it was closing the wound.  

I couldn’t waste time. Racing over I grabbed the dagger out of the dead leader's chest. With a burst of determination, I rushed over to put all my weight into bringing it down to the monster’s back mentally ordering it to stop hurting my friend.  

The dark shape arched back, hands at its side screeching in pain. It lashed out and a powerful arm hit my chest so hard I went flying. My body slammed against the wall knocking me out cold.  

I thought I was dead. Instead, I woke up to the sounds of birds singing.   

I was in Jay’s tent bundled in blankets. My eyes heavy from sleep. Soon pain from the previous night surfaced. I pushed it down to keep my eyes on Jay’s back watching him breathe in his sleep.  

Had I dreamed the entire thing?   

Carefully I sat up to look him over. He peacefully slept on his side; blankets pulled up covering half his face.  

Slowly I got out of the tent to look around. In the light of dawn, I didn’t recognize our campsite. I washed my face and got started on brushing my teeth. I felt like if I acted normal it would make the night's events into a dream.  

It was an oddly chilly morning. Jay soon crawled out of the tent bundled up. We got to work breaking down the campsite and packing up. Neither of us said a word as we started back where we came from.   

The dawn fog cleared and the morning sun chased the chill away. And yet, Jay didn’t remove his layers.  

Before noon, we stopped at a bridge. I knew this bridge and didn’t want to believe where we stood.  

Once we crossed this, our cars were a short walk away. It should have taken much longer to get here. I was glad to be nearly out of the woods, but this wasn’t right. I turned to face my friend, finding him a few feet away.  

“This is me.” I said the words causing a hole in my chest.  

“What are you talking about? Let's go.” I told him.  

I took a step towards him.   

He took a step back.  

The smile never left his face.  

“Thanks for asking me to do this. I had fun.”  

I shook my head not wanting to hear any of this.   

“I’m sorry. I didn’t do anything to help-” I started but he cut me off.  

“There was nothing you could have done. It’s not your fault.”  

I couldn’t accept that. I couldn't accept any of this.  

Darn shadows moved in the trees next to the tracks. Countless eyes watched us, waiting.  

“I did have fun. It was like being a kid. I never really got that chance to just hang out with someone and not have the fear of them talking behind my back. You were a good friend.”  

I hated how final this all sounded. I decided to go over to him and drag him back kicking and screaming home. I took two steps forward and the shadows in the trees reacted. A burst of dark black smoke came between us, sweeping away Jay as if he had never been there to start with.  

I yelled for him while running towards where he had stood. I fully planned on not leaving without him. A wave of crippling fear hit me. It stopped me in my tracks, my body shaking with cold sweats.  Some unseen force told me I was free to go, but if I pressed on, I would not leave these woods. Either one of us left here or neither of us did.  

I hated myself for turning on my heels and leaving Jay behind.  

My girlfriend noticed something was wrong when I came home. I lied saying I was just tired. For the next few days, I stayed in bed unable to forgive myself for what happened.  

No one came looking for Jay. He sent out a message to the people he knew that he would be gone for a little while longer. I soon realized he didn’t have very many people in his life who would notice his abstinence. He could simply disappear without anyone making a fuss.  

I haven’t been able to figure out what we came across in those woods. The small town near the old pathway burned down. No one was reported missing or killed. The fire swept away any kind of clues about what still lurks in that forest.  

I don’t know if Jay is safe with that monster. At the very least whatever that thing was seemed to be his type. Tall, thin with long hair. I would like to think he would laugh over me thinking that.   

I’ll miss him and regret losing a friend just as I got to know him. But I think he’s glad one of us was able to be free to live a normal life.
