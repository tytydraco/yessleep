I read a lot of your comments, and I’ll be honest, a lot of you are braver than I am. 

I hid from my phone that day like it was the plague. Almost like touching it would trigger something I didn’t want to happen. That night, I decided whatever was going on was way too weird for me. I wanted nothing to do with it. 

My job requires early morning wake-ups, and when I slipped out of the door at 6:30 am the next day, a single white rose was stuffed into my screen door with a white letter attached. To be honest, if not for the heightened paranoia at the weird events of the last few days, I don’t even think I would have noticed. 

I grabbed the flower, took a quick look towards my car, and decided to retreat into the house. I ripped open the envelope. 

*Alex,*

*I feel like you are avoiding me. I love all my fans, but you are a special case. This is real.*

*We are real.*

*I know this can be sudden, so I’ve arranged for you to meet with an assistant. It’s a public place, so you know there’s nothing weird going on.*

At the bottom was an address. A date. A time.

The Apple Orchard, a swanky restaurant I had never been to, with a time at 2 pm today. Ask for Dale at the front. 

I spent the morning staring at that address. My hands shook every time I pulled up Google Maps. At 1:15, I couldn't take it anymore. I told my boss I had a private matter to attend to.

This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be. But my curiosity forced my hand. 

I pulled into the parking lot around 1:50 pm. I sat with my thoughts, considering the reality that this could all be a big prank. I eeked out of the car, legs barely supporting my nerve-racked walk up to the host. 

“I am here to meet Dale.” I squeaked out, my fragile voice not giving me much leeway. 

The host looked down at his stand. Smiled and led me towards the back of the restaurant. I felt the eyes of the well-to-do patrons follow me, my work attire almost an insult to their senses.

“Mr. Dale will meet you behind this door.” The host offered a reconciliatory hand towards a bronze door. He turned heel and left me. I stood in awe. My curiosity was intoxicating. I grabbed the handle and pushed open the door. 

The smell of a cigar was immediate as a well-dressed man in a black suit and bowler hat sat opposite me. He took a pull, offering a hand for me to sit. 

“Alex, I’ve been waiting for you.” The man croaked out in between pulls. “You don’t mind if I smoke, do you?” I shook my head lightly as I pulled the chair and sat down opposite him. 

“Dale, is it?” I asked, the butterflies in my stomach still not acquiesing. 

He smiled. “For our purposes, that’s fine.” He cleared his throat. “Now I don’t mean to be rude, but I don’t have time to join you for lunch.” He motioned towards a menu placed to my left. “Feel free to order whatever; we will, of course, take care of it. But, I uhh, I have other obligations I must attend to.” He pointed down at a menu in front of him. “The shrimp scampi is delicious.”

I nodded, pretending to look down towards the menu, but the words didn’t quite compute in my current daze. “Wha-what is this?” I stuttered. 

Dale smiled. “I’ve come to deliver a few messages, drop off a few things. My client has taken quite an interest in you.”

“But-, but why me?” 

Dale chuckled, slapping his hand on his knee. “I suppose the heart wants what the heart wants. Huh? My client, well, she’s borderline obsessed with you.” 

“Obsessed?” 

“Take it as a compliment.” He took another pull from his cigar. He rose to his feet and pulled out a packet from a briefcase I had failed to notice before. He cleared his throat before gliding towards me. “This is a basic agreement, kinda like an NDA, you know what this is? Really just meant to protect my client as well as yourself.”

I reached for the document. 

Dale grabbed my hand. “I must warn you, my engagement requires me to leave in approximately two minutes with or without your signed document.”

I recoiled my hand in confusion. Dale continued.

“You are free to walk away from this whole situation, but if you wish to continue to converse with my client, I am going to need an answer and signature from you before I leave today.”

The words got caught in my throat. I felt my arm shake as Dale handed me the pen and stood towering over me. 

“Ca-can I-” 

“You have about a minute to decide, son.” 

I gulped. Maybe it was a mistake. Maybe it was way too risky. I didn’t care at that moment. I had to know what the hell was going on. I signed the document, handing it back over to Dale.

Dale sighed before his face creased into a smile. “Now I’m going to leave you with the contents in this briefcase. You must go directly home. We will compensate you for any missed time at work, got it? You are not to open this case whatsoever until 6 pm tonight, got it? If you break this rule, this contract is void.” He raised his eyebrows before tipping his hat and walking towards the door, leaving the briefcase by my side. “Oh, and Alex. Feel free to order some food. We will correspond with you later.”
