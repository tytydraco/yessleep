"Oh, come on! Just download it already!" Zeke said as he leaned against my desk. 

"I wanna know what weird dares you get!"

I sat in front of my computer at my boring desk job. Zeke, my best friend and coworker, had just slapped me upside my head a couple of minutes ago. 

When I rared back to punch him in the balls, he explained he had to do it and record it as part of his new dare from Desmond. 

When I further questioned him, he explained he received new dares via the app he had downloaded called "Desmond's Dare". If you beat the game levels, you apparently get awesome prizes like money, free trips to various places, the lastest devices for free, etc. 

Apparently, his newest dare was to slap your favorite coworker. 

I rolled my eyes as I searched "Desmond's Dare" on my phone. 

"Do itttt!!!" Zeke said as he moved to hover over me as I pressed "Install". 

The app quickly downloaded and once I pressed "Open" and "Accept All Terms and Conditions" my phone screen went dark. 

"Hi, I'm Desmond and I want to challenge you to the ultimate game of Challenging Dares. Do you accept?" The white letters spelled out on my darkened screen.

"Hit yes! Hit yes!" Zeke was practically bouncing infront of me. 

I sighed as I looked at my computer screen. No new emails. I had time to kill. 

I pressed "Yes" under the question as Zeke nearly squealed with excitement. 

"Welcome to the game! Be sure to check your notifications for new dares!" Displayed on my still darkened screen.

"Zeke, if you've fucked up my phone, your life is next!" I threatened.

Just then, a notification popped up on the top of my screen.

"Desmond dares you!" It read.

"Agree to the dare! You'll see what I mean!" Zeke said, still overly excited.

I clicked the notification:

"Desmond has dared you! Do you accept? Remember, if you accept, you must upload recorded proof of your dare." The message displayed across my phone screen. 

I clicked "Yes" and waited. 

"Desmond dares you to lick the wall closest to you!" 

The options to "Accept & Record" or "Deny & Lose" popped up under the dare. 

"Uhm, GROSS! I'll pass on getting whatever incurable diseases are on these walls, thanks!" I said, as I moved to click "Deny & Lose". 

"DON'T!" Zeke exclaimed and reached towards me like he would grab my wrist. "You always complain about how oh-so boring your life is! When was the last time you did something nuts?!"

He was right. I'm a single female in my early 30's with only 2 currently-dying houseplants to rush home to. 

I looked at him annoyed and huffed as I moved my thumb to click "Accept & Record". 

It immediately opened my camera and I could see my aggravated expression as I got up out of my desk chair and headed towards the closest wall, which was the wall of my cubicle.  

I noticed it was already recording me as I stuck my tongue out and slowly touched my tongue to the bumpy texture. I licked upwards maybe 3 inches then jerked away, as a weird mix of plastic and cardboard took over my taste buds. 

I could hear Zeke snickering behind me.

The app automatically stopped recording then displayed "Dare successfully uploaded! Desmond is satisfied! Wait for your next dare!" Then showed a scale that went up to 10. 

I was currently at scale level 3, a reward would be given if I reached 10.

"I got 40 bucks for accepting all my dares and uploading them until I hit 10!" Zeke said proudly. "I'm currently working to hit  25!" 

Just then, I heard my Outlook Email notification sound. I looked at my computer to see the main boss has sent me a couple things to complete before the end of the day. 

"Back to the ol' grind for me!" I said as I swiveled my chair back towards my computer screen. Zeke went back to his own desk, promising to keep me updated on his progress.

The rest of the day passed quickly as I had plenty to keep me busy. As I slid behind the wheel of my car and placed the key in the ignition, I heard my phone chime. I had a new notification.

"Desmond dares you! Do you accept?" 
I clicked "Yes" feeling both anxious and a little excited.  

"Desmond dares you to flash the camera!" 

My heart dropped. That was quite a jump from my previous dare. I looked around the empty parking lot save for a few vacant cars. No one in sight. I thought of Zeke bragging on his winning earnings and I really could use any extra money I could get. 

I sighed then clicked "Accept & Record".

My camera popped up, already recording. I quickly pulled my shirt and bra up to my throat for about 5 seconds then quickly jerked them back down into place. I scanned the parking lot again after, satisfied there was still no signs of other life. 

As I started my car and began the 15 minute drive home, I heard the sound of a notification on my phone.

Once I pulled into my driveway and parked, I quickly reached to check my phone. A few notification from the app made my heart race.

"Dare successfully uploaded! Desmond is satisfied! Please wait for your next dare!"

I touched the screen for the next message:

"Level 1 completed! Please accept your reward!"

My mouth dropped as the reward displayed for 50 bucks! I quickly entered my Venmo information.  

"$50 successfully transferred! Remember to watch for your next dare to conquer the next level!"

Sure enough, 50 bucks was transferred to my Venmo. I laughed to myself then headed into my house to make dinner and await my next dare. 

Just as my pizza was ready and I pulled it out of the oven, I heard knocks at my door. 

I hurried out of the small kitchen to my front door and slowly opened it as I was not expecting anyone. 

Zeke stood grinning, holding a bottle of wine on the otherside, "Want some company?!" 

Zeke and I were spread out on my couch eating pizza and drinking the wine he brought when I heard my phone chime again. A new notification. 

"Desmond dares you! Do you accept?" I quickly clicked "Yes" as Zeke excused himself to the restroom. 

"Desmond dares you to tell your coworker the truth about your throughs on their new promotion!"

My blood turned to ice. How did the app know to ask such a thing? Zeke had been the recipient of a promotion at our job recently. Outwardly, I smiled and cheered him on. However, I honestly felt differently.  I was upset. I was also a candidate for that promotion and I lost it to him. 

Truthfully, I didn't think he deserved it. He was late all the time and I covered for him. I had helped him numerous times to meet deadlines for important projects he put off until the the last minute. He unfairly won it because of my help. 

But I couldn't tell him that. He was my best friend and it would kill our friendship and hurt him if he knew. 

I debated on what to do. Finally, I decided to click "Deny & Lose". 

Once I did, a creepy angry looking face appeared on the screen.

"You refused. Desmond is angry! You can accept a punishment dare or risk your previously uploaded dares to be posted online. What do you choose?"

"Accept Punishment Dare" or "Upload Previously Recorded Dares" were the options under the angry message. I then noticed in a smaller font read: "Previous dares will upload automatically if punishment is not successfully uploaded in 30 minutes". 

I felt sick. I remembered my idiot self flashing the camera earlier, face fully visible in the clip. I really did not want to risk that being posted who knows where. Zeke did not warn me this could happen if you refused a dare!

When I heard the bathroom door open, I quickly clicked "Accept Punishment Dare".

"Desmond is not happy. Desmond dares you to cut the person closest to you right now! Recording will start automatically in 30 seconds."


Zeke plopped down on the couch next to me as I looked at the knife on the coffee table I had used to cut the pizza.

"Had any new interesting dares?" Zeke asked as I looked back at him. 

"Uh..  actually yes!" I said as reached for the knife. 

Once the knife was in my hand, I sat back on the couch. Zeke looked at me with a weird expression. 

"You won't believe what I did!" I said as I moved a bit in my seat, causing my phone to fall and land close to Zeke's feet. 

As I had figured, Zeke reached down to pick it up. I could see us both on the screen, leaning down. Just as he reached to grab my phone, I brought the knife down and across the top of his hand. 

Zeke immediately recoiled, grabbing his hand, "What the hell, Jackie?!"

I dropped the knife and picked up my phone. I aimed the phone towards Zeke as I began apologizing. Recording him looking at his bloody hand.

"Dare successfully uploaded! Desmond is satisfied! Please wait for your next dare!"

I breathing a sigh of relief as Zeke rushed off back to the bathroom to clean his wound.

"I never should have downloaded this app..." I mumbled to myself.
