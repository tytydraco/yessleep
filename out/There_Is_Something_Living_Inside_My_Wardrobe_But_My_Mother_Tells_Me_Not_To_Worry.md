There is something living inside my wardrobe, but my mother tells me not to worry.

I try to be a good girl and listen. I don’t want my new mother to be anxious, and I don’t want any punishments, either.

In the daytime, it’s easy to ignore.

I go to school from eight to four, and afterwards mother likes me to stay with her in the living room so that she can make sure I’m doing my homework. She sits on the old sofa that smells like cinnamon and bleach, and I sit between her legs on the floor, practicing my arithmetic as she watches Desperate Housewives and runs a comb through my hair. Sometimes, she pulls the comb too hard, but I don’t mind. At the orphanage, I could go weeks without anyone touching me at all.

But brave as I try to be, it’s harder to ignore the wardrobe during the night.

Even when I shut my eyes tight as corks in glass bottles and smother my face inside my blanket, I can still hear the violent thumping of the wardrobe as it shakes and shudders. Sometimes, it sounds as though someone is trying to tip over the wardrobe from inside. The old wood creaks and trembles so violently that I think the whole neighborhood must hear it. Other times – like when I’m finally drifting off to sleep – the sound becomes muted. The thump-thump-thumping like a resigned heartbeat.

The first night I stayed here, I did try and open the wardrobe. I woke up in the middle of the night, panting and confused from an already-hazy nightmare, and in my state of dream delirium, I’d tugged helplessly at the door, thinking a stray kitten or other small, vulnerable animal had ended up trapped inside. But the door had been locked, and I had woken mother with my hysterics. When she realized the cause of my wailing, she had not been pleased. My backside stung for a week.

The next morning, mother sat me down and told me that there was nothing important inside the wardrobe, much less a suffering cat in need of rescue. The wardrobe had been locked for many months now, and if there was anything inside, she reassured me, it was not alive.

And yet, that did not stop the thumping and buzzing of the restless wardrobe. Neither did ignoring it. After many days of obedience, the creaks and groans did not settle, but instead, began taking on ambiguous patterns in my mind. Although I couldn’t yet decipher the noises, they sounded like forbidden whispers.

“I know there’s not a kitty inside the wardrobe,” I said to mother one evening, during our usual session in the living room. “But what is inside?”

The comb in my hair pressed into my scalp. Not hard enough to sting, but a warning bite. I could hear mother’s breath hitch before she forced herself to resume her brushing.

“Why do you want to know?” she asked.

“Just curious.”

“Ah, well, if there *are* any dead kittens, that would be the cause,” she said. “Curiosity.”

At first, I thought that was all she was going to say on the matter. It wasn’t until many minutes later – during the commercial break of her show – that she cleared her throat. “If you must know, I use it for storage. Suitcases, documents. And a few sentimental items. They’d mean nothing to you, but the world to me. That’s why I keep it locked.”

I could hear the truth in her voice, and it was enough for me. Still, she gripped me by the roots of my hair, her manicured nails digging into my scalp like polished daggers.

“So don’t try and open that wardrobe again,” she warned.

“Yes ma’am.”

“Because you know the first rule of being a good child, yes?”

“Obey,” I recited dutifully, used to this particular question.

“Who?”

“Those who know better than you.”

“Good.” Mother withdrew her nails, and kissed me tenderly on the same spot she had just wounded. “Now go brush your teeth.”

I listened immediately, as I did with most of mother’s orders. Partially because mother’s punishments could be swift and capricious, but also because I enjoyed living with her. It was clear that, despite her mood swings, mother wanted me around. She packed my lunchbox with all of my favorites, tucked me into bed each night, and genuinely seemed to love being a mother. Plus, she had stocked my room with enough toys that Santa’s workshop would have seemed dingy in comparison. Board games, video games, plush stuffed animals. Many of the toys seemed used, but I didn’t mind second-hand items; at the orphanage, I was lucky to inherit things third-hand or fourth.

In all honesty, if it weren’t for the wardrobe, I could have been content with mother for many years. But although I had started putting cotton in my ears before bed, the wardrobe grew more insistent over the weeks. One night, I dreamed it grew oak-splintered hands and reached out to me, wrapping its wooden fingers around my ankle and dragging me, screaming, into its belly. When I gasped awake, I turned my sights to the wardrobe. Although it could have been my imagination, I swore it had moved an inch closer during my slumber.

Since then, sleep has been harder to come by. Most days, I stay up until dawn glaring at the wardrobe. Sometimes I think a masked man sneaks inside during the day, and rattles the wardrobe during the night – waiting for the right moment to pounce. Other times, I imagine a shackled and gagged prisoner banging their head against the wardrobe for help – stuck inside by a deranged madman, unbeknownst to mother and me. And still other times I think of aliens, or shadow men, or demonic creatures.

But the most consistent, horrible thought? Above any other theory, I think about how this mother isn’t my first mother, and I wonder: what if I am not this mother’s first child, either? What if there were others before me? And what if it is their restless ghosts reaching out to me from inside that wardrobe?

The toll of not-knowing hurts most of all. And so, I decide I must find out.

When mother comes to wake me for school this morning, she is irritated that I am not already dressed. Normally, the punishment for such a thing would be steep, but when she sees the shadows underneath my eyes, her mouth softens. I reach out a clammy hand for her study (taken directly from a movie we had watched a few weeks ago) and let out a pitiful cough.

Although I don’t explicitly ask, she tells me that I can stay home from school today.

“You’ve been such a good girl,” she says. “The best girl. You deserve it.”

She leaves a cup of tea in my hands and places a stuffed bunny with someone else’s initials into the crook of my arm before heading to work. I wait, sipping on tea and squeezing the bunny, until I hear her car engine fade away. Then I rush to her room in search of the key. I expect finding the key to be a difficult task, but I spot it on top of mother’s dresser, unguarded. Waiting. It’s shiny and bronze and looks like a perfect fit.

Refusing to give myself enough time to become intimidated, I grab the key and hurry back to my bedroom. As I approach the wardrobe, it is ominously still. My heartbeat is the only sound as I insert the key into the lock. Click. It turns easily, the key a perfect fit.

I stare into the wardrobe. It is not dead children, or dead madmen, or anything dead at all. It is a phone. I stare for a long moment, dazed and unmoving. In fact, I don't so much as swallow until I am interrupted by a sudden sound. 

*Buzz, buzz.*

The phone has just gotten a message. A message that sends the phone into a tizzy of vibrations, shaking the old wood and reverberating through the hollow wardrobe with an awful groaning noise. The same noise that’s been haunting my dreams.

*Buzz, buzz.*

With trembling fingers, I pick up the phone. I feel dizzy, faint.

*Dearest Daughter: if you’re reading this, I wish you weren’t.*

*Buzz, buzz.*

*Dearest Daughter: if you’re reading this, I wish you weren’t.*

I open up the messages and scroll up to find nothing but more of the same text. The same message sent over and over again for days, weeks, months. Years. I’ve only been here for one month. When the dizziness grows stronger, I think that I’m about to faint from fear. But when my mouth grows unreasonably dry, my eyes widen. What kind of tea has mother given me?

*Dearest Daughter: if you’re reading this, I wish you weren’t.*

*Dearest Daughter: if you’re reading this, I wish you weren’t.*

*Dearest Daughter: if you’re reading this, I wish you weren’t.*

Dread filling my lungs, I toss the phone back into the wardrobe. But as I’m slamming the door shut, I notice a peculiar sound before the next buzz…a little *swoosh.*

Like someone sending a text.

When I turn around, I already know mother is waiting in the doorway. I don’t expect how sad she looks.

“Oh, darling,” she says, her voice thick with tears. “This is always my least favorite part of being a mom.”

She rushes towards me. I try to dive away, but before I can take another step, the dizziness overwhelms me and blackness takes me.

When I wake, I’m lying on a cold wooden floor, and I hear a dull prying sound. It’s dim, but as I struggle to sit up, I can see I’m in the basement. At my stirring, mother looks over at me, her brows pushing together in discomfort.

“I wasn’t expecting you to be awake yet,” she says. She sighs and rises to her feet. “Parenting is a perpetual struggle. But us Mothers? We overcome.”

As mother stalks towards me, I scramble backwards. On the other side of the basement, I see what was making the scraping sound.  A pickaxe. Mother was pulling up the wooden floors. She was digging something out. No, not something. A coffin. And that’s when I realize: mother was right. There was nothing important inside the wardrobe. The bodies were always in the basement.

I try to make a break for the stairs, but mother is bigger and stronger and faster. She closes in on me and pulls me tightly against her. For a moment, it’s a comfort – the love of being held close by someone who means it – but it’s too tight. This love, it’s smothering me. I can’t lift my face from her chest; it’s hurting my nose and I can’t get enough oxygen into my lungs. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe at all.

“You were doing so good,” mother cries. “You were so respectful, so smart. But don’t you know the first rule is the most important? I won't have a disobedient child."

I scratch and claw at mother, but she doesn’t flinch, even when my nails tear into her flesh. 

As darkness presses in on the edge of my vision, the last thing I hear is:

“I could have been a good mother to you…”
