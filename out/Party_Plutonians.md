This shit was crazy and I want to tell y’all about it. My friends and I were about to graduate high school. Unfortunately, it also meant that we’d be going our separate ways. Each of our professional pursuits required us to go to different schools. We wanted to see each other off and decided the best way to do that was by throwing a massive rager.  
  
  
We planned it the month before graduation since the month of, we'd be busy studying for finals. Knowing how strict our parents were, we made sure to pick a date when our parents would be out of town. Marlin sent invites out with the caveat that nobody could take pictures or anything of the event. Graig got the party supplies and by party supplies, I mean booze and weed.  
  
  
Meanwhile, Del and I were in charge of entertainment. We had it all planned out with rounds of Halo, Smash Bros., COD, Guitar Hero, and Mortal Kombat. The party was being held at my house and the games were all at his so we needed to bring them over. Here's where shit got crazy. On the drive back, a blue streak of light appeared in the road almost in front of us.  
  
"Wow, what the hell?" Del asked after slamming on the brakes.  
  
  
We saw some sort of silver hover car with a blue glow underneath. The windows were tinted so we weren't able to see inside. The front doors opened, releasing a cloud of steam. Within it, were two humanoid silhouettes. Our jaws dropped.   
  
  
Before us, were two aliens. They were both blue, one being a regular shade of it and the other being lighter. Antennae were sticking from their heads. The blue one had brown hair and the light blue one had red hair. We just stared at each other for a moment.  
  
  
Finally, after the long silence, the light blue one spoke.  
  
  
"Is this Terra?" he asked.  
  
  
I was about to say no when I remembered that it was Earth in Latin.  
  
  
"Yeah, what're you doing here?" I replied.  
  
  
The aliens were ecstatic.  
  
  
"Man, you don't know how many lightyears we drove to get here. We've been observing your planet for a long time and we want to do some hot stuff here," the blue one said.  
  
"We were actually on our way to a party," Del explained. "Y'all can tag along if you want. First, we should introduce ourselves."  
  
  
We did so. It turned out the aliens were brothers and  lived on Pluto but one different from ours. Space and time get wonky traveling a trillion something light years. The Plutonians as they are called had a language, the phonetics of which I wouldn't have been able to imitate even if I was stone cold sober.  The aliens' names in Earth language, English in this case translated to something close to Harland and Toney.  
  
  
Harland was the blue and the light blue one was Toney. Akin to us, they were also wanting to have some fun. They’d stolen their dad’s car while their parents were away.  
  
“We figured we could stop here for a while and head back before anyone notices we’re gone,” Harland said.  
  
"You came to the right place.  Y'all follow behind us," Del replied.  
  
"How about we give you a ride?" Toney offered. "We can tow your car behind us."  
  
"Oh, hell yeah," I said.  
  
  
We entered the back seat doors. The inside was velvety with a silky smooth texture. Harland got in the passenger seat and Toney got in the driver seat.  
  
  
"You might want to buckle up," he said.  
  
  
We heeded his advice. Del's car was hit with a tractor beam and it began levitating behind us. Toney hit some buttons and flipped switches, then he shifted gears and hit the gas. In Star Wars fashion we entered warp speed and instantaneously we were at my house.  
  
  
"What, they went and started without us!" Del said.  
  
  
Indeed, lights were already flashing and I could faintly hear music when we stepped out. I understand being impatient, but I'd be damned if I was going to let them get away with that at my house. Del and I burst inside and everyone cast glances in our direction. Bobby and Keith who were busy with a beer pong match turned to look at us along with the others in the living room.  
  
  
"Really, you couldn't wait ten minutes?" I asked them.  
  
Bobby and Keith exchanged a glance.  
  
  
"You guys have been gone a lot longer than that," Bobby said. "Why didn't you answer when we called?"   
  
  
We were confused as hell and that's when Harland and Toney stepped in.  
  
  
"Holy shit, are those aliens?" Keith asked.  
  
"They're Plutonians," Del answered.  
  
"Sorry, we're late. We accidentally overshot the warp speed," Toney said.  
  
  
That explained our being late. It turned out we jumped an hour into the future.  
  
  
"I told you to be careful about that,” Harland scolded. “Who knows when we might’ve ended up?”  
  
“Okay, I said my bad. Anyway, who’s ready to turn shit up?”  
  
  
From his pocket, Toney pulled out a golden cube. He pressed it, causing it to project different objects.  We had no idea what most of them did. However, a few we recognized, namely, a bong, a bag of weed, some kind of beer, and joint paper made from a plant similar to a banana leaf.  
  
  
“We’ll let you try some of our stuff if you let us try some of yours,” Toney said.  
  
  
Everyone cheered and then the bong passing and joint rolling were underway.  This wasn’t your average bong either. It made whatever was being smoked out of it far more potent. On top of that, the weed they brought was quite literally out of this world. Out of curiosity, we inquired as to where they got it.   
  
  
They said they got it on a distant planet from some gray in a business suit. It had me feeling emotions I didn’t even know existed.  I shit you not, we were levitating off the ground. Not only did Harland and Toney bring some awesome weed and beer, the latter fo which is not for light weights. Believe me. They were also awesome at video games.  
  
  
We got into a drinking contest on Halo matches.  
  
  
“Hey, why don’t we spruce this thing up?” Harland asked.  
  
  
He used one of their devices which kind of looked like a metal octopus and attached to our Xbox. It spread, covering it entirely. Halo was still on the screen, but it was a different version. The title read Halo and beside it was some strange symbol. The graphics made even 8K look like 240p.   
  
  
The selection of characters, weapons, stages, and even story modes seemed almost endless. If they’d just brought that they’d still have been the life of the party. Eventually, they got off the game and were approached by some girls. They needed some beers chilled. I should mention that Plutonins have the power to cool things down with a touch.  
  
  
 No pun intended, we thought that was pretty cool. The same girls hooked up with Harland and Toney. I bet that gave them something to remember. Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever and our party was no exception.  We were playing through other enhanced games when we heard a booming voice.  
  
  
  
“What the fuck are you all doing?” Our dad roared.  
  
  
Bob and Keith were chugging Pluto beer. Harland and Toney were eating cake and nachos. Del and I were team fighting in enhanced Smash Bros. and froze.  
  
  
“M-mom, D-dad, you’re home early,” I choked out.  
  
“You’re damn right we are,” my mom said. “We saw what you were doing on Facebook.”  
  
“What?”  
  
  
In hindsight, expecting a bunch of inebriated and stoned high schoolers to follow rules wasn’t the brightest idea. Several people had been streaming the party and had posted them to various platforms. The streams somehow found their way onto Facebook causing my and many other parents to see them.  
  
  
“I can explain!” I pleaded.  
  
  
“We don’t want to hear it,” my dad snapped. “We want everyone here out including your little alien friends.”  
  
“But they just wanted to have some fun!”  
  
  
My mom then did something that struck fear into any kid who knows they’re in deep shit. A smile spread across her face.  
  
  
“That’s about to come to an end.  Lorena! Milford!”  
  
  
Harland and Toney looked as if their hearts had stopped. In came their parents who had run into mine on the way to the house.  
  
  
“We trusted you two to stay home alone,” Lorena said.  
  
“Yeah, you two don’t appreciate what we do for you,” Milford added.  
  
“You can’t control us!” Toney shot back.  
  
  
Lorena’s eyes narrowed. She held her hand up to Milford who took off his belt. Any hint of defiance in Harland and Toney went out in choked gasps. Their mom raised the belt and they flinched.  
  
  
“Get in the car now,” she commanded in a scarily leveled tone.   
  
Her order was obeyed without question. We felt bad for Harland and Toney who looked as if they were marching to their own graves. I knew I wasn’t far off. Our parents did at least allow us to see each other off.  Lorena and Milford had driven their other hover car to Earth and were going to tow the other back to Pluto. Del, Bob, Keith, and I talked to Harland and Toney before they left.  
  
  
  
"Will we see each other again?" I asked.  
  
"Maybe someday, but we had a great time," Harland replied.  
  
"And now it's over," Lorena said. "Get in."  
  
  
As they were about to take off, they each beat a fist on their chests and raised them to us. We nodded solemnly and returned the gesture. Nobody in attendance was spared the wrath of their parents. In fairness, we did completely trash the house. My friends and I were forced to take part-time jobs to help pay for repairs.   
  
  
Another reason is that the booze and weed was brought with some of our parents' money. I didn't find this out until later. At the very least, it did give me some work experience.  It's been over six years since that night. Its popularity has mostly died down.   
  
  
Occasionally, I will get questions from strangers and government officials, mostly asking if I got anything from the Plutonians. I still have the bong and game enhancer. Like hell, I am going to give them to some government scrubs, though.  
 I heard through the grapevine that NASA is developing technology that can take people to Pluto. Maybe I should reach out to Del, Bob, and Keith about it.   
  
  
We can plan a space trip. Harland and Toney, if you're reading this, let's hang out again and I'll make sure to bring your [bong](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) and [game enhancer.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
