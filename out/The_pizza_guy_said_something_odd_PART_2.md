So, ya boi's got an update.



I didn't actually kill myself since last time! I managed to keep myself together. Heh.

And now I've got a hot date! "Score!" But things aren't all good. I think the pizza guy

is out to get me. I know this because of an odd thing my Girl Friend said to me.

I came home from a day of odd work. All my coworkers were acting... odd. My coworker 

Stephanie came up to me. Ahh, good ol' Stephanie. Never let me down! But this isn't

the stephanie I know. She came up to me and said "Do you know where the coffee machine is?"

Huh. I thought she knew. I locked in and said nothing. Stared 'er in the eye. I knew she'd

slip up like this. She always lets me down. Afterwards she reported me to the big boss. He

questioned me... but I stood my ground. "She was actin' weird... and I knew it." The boss

suspended me from work. I was so raged, I broke his table and farted a lil bit. Then I

picked up his favorite coffee mug and gave 'em a Cleveland Steamer. SMASHED IT TO BITS!

He extended my suspension. 3 weeks! What do I do now? I've got nothin' to do! What do I do?

I gho home and play my "Nintendo Switch". I was playing Breath of the Wild (This is an old

story. Old game! Tears of the kingdom is a bit better. Great game!) and my GirlFriend goes

up to me and says "I'm going to the store do you want anything" hmm. This is odd. She has

never said this... ever. She usually says... "Want anything?" not "do you." Bit odd. I look

her in the eye, skeptically. "Uhh.. sure?" She gets confused. "What? Y- what do you want?"

I'm under the impression that this may be one of Stephanie's troops trying to take me down!

So I look her in the eye and say... "Coffe Machine." She says: "I meant, like, ... a snack?"

Hmm.. this is odd. Sne never gets me food... Except since last thursday. She got me Pizza!

Spider man pizza theme plays! LOL anyways on witht he story, shall we? On with the show!

The show must go on! Let's begin, shall we? Let's begin! On with the show! Let's being.

Let's hop to i! Let's begin. My girlfriend stops talking and just walks away. And what I say

next may shock you. Let's begin. See, one time, when I was 10 years old, I found a dead body

in the woods and I never told anyone. She says to me, "Okay. Bye." But when she goes to

leave, I put my hand out and say "STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!" (Skyrim anyone? Heh!) 

And she turns around and says "..What?" I say.. Let's begin; "Uhh... stop. I gotta tell

ya somethin'." She stands there and just listens. I say; " When I was younger, I saw a big

body. In the woods. It was scary... and I never told a soul. Now I tell you."

She looks at me all weird. I could tell in her eyes that she was on the verge of tear's. (

Of the kingdom. Zelda anyone?) Sorry. Done with the jokes, just being a bit quirky.

Let's begin. "Uhh... yeah. That happened." She sort of just turns around and leaves...

bit odd... But I go back to playing Botw for 3 whole weeks... and she doesn't come bacc.

Uhh... what's going on? I think. I thought she love me! But apparently not. Let's begin at

the beginning... I was at High School and I met her. Her name is Heather Richardson George

and we met by an odd lake.  I knew something was odd about this lake... it';s where I think

pizza guy cursed me. So The Next Day I Came Back Into Work. Stephanie was still there..

I thought they'd fire her but I gues not. My boss came and said "You're still suspended (My

name. Not revealin'!)" and I said "Uhh... no way. My 3 week is up. Lemme in!" And my bos

said "You're fired." Aaaaah! I said: "Bruh. Let me pack my tings... I guess." So I pick up

my Nintendo Switch (My work one not my home one) which I play instead of working. My boss

kept telling me to leave... which was odd. He doesn't usually do this.. and... doesn't he

WANT work done? After all, since I'm fired, I'm technically working free! Odd! Weeeird!

Let's begin. This is where things got intense. I ordered a pizza. The piuzza guy came.

Pizza time! he said. "Spider man 2 anyone?" I say. Pizza guy: You are not an individual.

Pizza: Yep. I scream! Run back inside! I pick up the nearest spoon and run to my boss' house

(It is 4am at this time) and scoop his eyes out. Hung 'em on my wall!  Came back into my

house and my pizza was there. Pizza time! "Spider man 2 anyone?' and I bLet's begin.egin

eating. It is cold and soggy... like my soul. And heart  After my grill friend left me.

And I'm sad! And MAD! I go to my girlfriend's house and club 'er in the face. She's out co

ld! Let's begin. She's out cold because I knocked 'er out. What do I do now? Kill myself?

Or kill her...? I kill her. As I'm writing this, the cops are OUTSIDE. Making my way out!

Ran outside and ent-way o-tay e-thay ar-cay! (Pig latin for went to the car) (Pigs anyone?)

(Oink!) I drive off into the woods. I spend some time there in an odd log cabin I found..

with my nintendo Swich.I played Mario Wonder! (Later time period) and it was fun. I got

a bit stuck on Piranha Plants on Parade... but it was ok. They sang a fun song. I persevered.

So I went back home and my girlfriend was on da couch. I said "Damn boi! You thicc!"

She called the cops on me, and I faced some jailtime. But luckily I had my Nintendo Switch.

I played "Mario RPG" and "Breah of the Wild" (Zelda anyone?) Let's begin. Any tips on 

Divine Beast Naboris? I'm stuck! Anyway,  in prison I'm eating the food and it's grose!

So I go to the chef and say.. "I want dino nuggies! This slop stinks!" He just looks at me

and keeps cookin'.. but I abide by one rule: Let Him Cook! So i back off... and enjoy my

slop... or try to. Blech! I go home and there is an "Eviction Notice" on the table.

Wow. I didn't know they made Tf2 items real. (https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Eviction\_Notice)

Lol just a joke. I'm scared! I don't want to "Move Out!" So When the IRS comes (Yoshi tax

fraud anyone?) I shoot 'em with my gun. POW! POW! (Pow blocks from Mario anyone)

So I make my way home and there's an odd Eviction Notice on the t



Let's begin. My landlord comes home and says :Ya gotta get out! Breh.  I say: "No way hosay.

 my Home!" and I shoot 'em with my gun.  When I make it home, there's an odd pizza on the couch.

Yummy! (Score) So I take (Spider-man 2, anyone) a piece and shove it in my gullet.

I go downstairs and suddenly, I see a man-made horror beyond my comprehension. Yiiikes.

Not pog. gers. I grab my steak knife (usually for steak)(s and such) and give 'em a stab.

Nothing happen! He sends me back to 4 weeks ago.
