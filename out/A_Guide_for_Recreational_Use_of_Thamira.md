Hey there, spiritual traveller! 
Welcome to the finished guide me and a couple of other moderators of the r/thamira subreddit have tailored for the recreational use of the common deliriant known as Thamira, ‘Hellspeaker’ or ‘Bloodbloom’.

This drug gets a lot of bad rep, but mostly this is caused by common misuse and lack of research. Used the right way, Tham can actually invoke a spiritual experience like no other. It’s really quite fascinating!

Before we start the guide, I have compiled a short FAQ for the newcomers to this sub. Any other questions, the team and I will be happy to answer in the comments below. Feel free to scroll to the guide if you find the science-y stuff boring, or find yourself an experienced user.

*What is Thamira?*
Thamira, its scientific name being “Thamira Solanaceae”, is a plant of the nightshade family, commonly used since ancient times for pain relief, spiritual experiences and religious rituals. The plant is characterized by its dark red, almost coppery flowers. 
Fun fact: The etymology of Thamira has scholars divided; the two main camps being it either coming from the Sanskrit ‘Tamra’, meaning copper, or the Greek ‘Thanasis’, meaning death.

*How do I intake it?*
Thamira is very versatile: You can eat or snort the seeds, brew tea or alcohol with the leaves and flowers, or even crush the roots! Usually, intake is done orally, but snorting crushed Thamira or even making it into a salve and smearing it on the skin are possibilities. Generally, though, the oral or nasal intake of the seeds or dried flowers are used for delirious effects.

*Where can I find Thamira?*
Thamira grows on every continent (yes, every; it has even been found on the northern shores of Antartica!), but is most commonly found near the equator. Multiple different subspecies exist, with slight variations in looks, effects and  risk associated with use. 

*How much Thamira should i start off with?*
Generally, there is no real way to know; each species, and even plant, yields different effects. However, lethality at under 5 seeds is statistically very unlikely. Experimenting is key.

Well then, let’s get on with the guide, or what i like to call it, the *Tham-rules*!

1. Find yourself a suitable plant. For a more predictable experience, using a ripe specimen is recommended. You can test this by making sure the flowers are fully bloomed and a deep shade of red. When sticking a needle in the stem, it should bleed black.

Using an unbloomed flower will lead to a painful death through organ failure. If the flower is lighter, with a green centre, it is unripe. This is generally fine, but usage may lead to prolonged or more powerful hallucinations, and bears higher risk of brain damage.

2. Pray to your God of choice. Seems cliche, but has worked for me. The entities usually get nicer with the threat of divine intervention.

3. Pluck off the spiky seed-containers of the plant and use a knife to carefully slice it up. Inside lay hundreds of seeds. Retrieve the amount of your choice. 

*Do not* mistake the seed vaults for the seeds themselves. You are about to enter Hell. Intaking a dosage too large will lead to you staying — and there is no guarantee death will help you escape.

4. Either crush the seeds up or consume them whole. Snorting them will increase potency, but will also make the effects kick in faster. Once they are consumed, there is no way back from delirium.

5. Put on some lo-fi or chill music, turn the lights down and cover yourself in a blanket. Throw all knives, scissors and other sharp objects out your window. Lock your entrance door, and throw the key out too. Ensure you have no escape. Now, dress down and make sure your environment is relaxing. I prefer to strip naked, but it is really up to yourself.

6. Do not include a ‘trip-sitter’ or anything of a similar fashion. Chances are they can see your ‘hallucinations’ too.

7. I probably should have included this earlier, but if you have a tendency for self harm or suicidal tendencies, please re-decide. If it is too late, *call an ambulance*. Attempt to strap yourself down or otherwise restrain yourself until help arrives. 

8. After around 30 minutes (if taken in orally), the trip should start. You will see unnatural shadows or movement in your peripheral vision. Don’t worry, these are all fake: or at least either not able or allowed to cause you physical harm. 

9. At the hour mark, your surroundings will seem more blurry and moving. Your walls may distort, or be covered in blood. Keep sitting down. Hallucinations will become more realistic, and auditory disturbances will come into play. In contrast to psychedelic drugs like LSD, hallucinations will generally be darker or more melancholy.

10. If you’ve heard about the Hat Man, now is when he arrives. If you have not heard about him, or do not have sufficient info to form an understanding of his being, he will not appear. You are lucky. I will not go into further details of him: Those of you unknowing should remain so. There are also multiple threads on this sub with more info for those of you curious.

11. You may hear the voices of loved ones. They are only trying to trick you into the shadows.

12. Do not look behind you at this stage. 

13. At the two hour mark, you will start to physically feel the trip. You are nearing the peak. Your feet may be covered in sticky blood, or insects will run across your face. This is no reason to panic.

14. If you feel hands on your shoulders, scream as loud as you can. Hopefully you’ll scare Him. 

15. When a booming voice appears, know you are speaking to the Devil. Be formal. Know that there have been many before you: Ancient shamans used Thamira for this exact purpose. 

You may ask It one question exactly. Know the answer will contain a negative outcome for you. If it was not supposed to be as such, the future or past will change for it. 

15.1 Do *NOT* ask it any existential question, such as the fate of the universe or that of humanity. 

A folk story exists of an ancient shaman once asking It the meaning of life. Once she received her answer, the woman immediately impaled herself through the head with a chair’s leg. All in all, it’s a negative outcome for everyone involved.

16. Once the devil disappears, you will see horrors so far beyond comprehension you will seek death. This is why you hid your knives. Instead of self-stabbings, if that is avoided, most people end up with nail scratches all over their body, even in places they hadn’t – or could not – reach.

17. You will suddenly be hit by a wave of drowsiness. Please, for the love of God, accept the sleepy feeling and cradle unconscious.

18. Your dreams will be quite vivid. If you have a dream journal, this will be the perfect opportunity to use it. The dreams may tell you truths of yourself you did not know. Embrace it.

19. You will wake up in your childhood bedroom, or another sentimental personal space. You are not awake. Go back to sleep.

20. When you wake up where you started, 3 days will have passed. Phone a friend; make them gather your stuff and open your front door for you. 

The shadows will stay for at least a week, and they will speak to you. Your mouth will be dry, your mind clouded and your vision blurry. Amnesia will kick in: The horrors will mostly fade away. In addition, most people end up 5 IQ-points lower than they had before the trip.

Was it worth it? I sure think so.
