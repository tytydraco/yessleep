Right at that exact moment my phone rang. It was a call from my own number. The same number that used to belong to my dead mom....  
  
To this day it haunts me and I have no idea how to explain to myself what happened. I know it could be a glitch, but it's literally never ever happened before. I stood frozen in terror and stared at the notification on my smart watch wondering if I was in some sort of psychosis, doing a double take not being able to believe my own eyes.  
  
Right there in the background is her camera case, from which I got the SD card that contained the photos that I was looking at.  
  
To this day I keep asking myself what the fuck would've possibly happened, had I picked up the phone....  
  
But I didn't. I couldn't. I was too scared to hear her voice again, or worse, something else. Something sinister and mocking. Something that knew my deepest fears and secrets. Something that wanted to torment me for some unknown reason.  
  
I dropped the phone and ran out of the room, leaving behind the laptop with the photos still open. I didn't care about anything else. I just wanted to get away from that cursed device that somehow connected me to the other side.  
  
I ran down the stairs, hoping to find someone who could help me. Someone who could tell me that it was all a prank or a mistake. Someone who could make me feel safe and sane again.  
  
But there was no one. The house was empty and silent. The only sound was the ringing of the phone, echoing through the halls and rooms. It followed me wherever I went, like a relentless predator.  
  
I reached the front door and tried to open it, but it was locked. I looked for the keys, but they were nowhere to be found. I felt a surge of panic and desperation. I was trapped in this nightmare with no escape.  
  
I banged on the door, screaming for help. But no one answered. No one came. No one cared.  
  
I slumped down on the floor, feeling hopeless and defeated. I closed my eyes and wished it would all end.  
  
But it didn't. The phone kept ringing and ringing and ringing.  
  
And then it stopped.  
  
I opened my eyes and saw a shadow looming over me. A familiar figure with long hair and a pale face.  
  
"Mom?" I whispered, hoping against hope that it was really her.  
  
She smiled and reached out her hand.  
  
"Hello, sweetie," she said in a voice that sounded like a thousand needles piercing my ears.  
  
"I've been waiting for you."  
  
She grabbed my wrist and pulled me up with a strength that belied her frail appearance.  
  
"Come with me," she said as she dragged me towards the stairs.  
  
"Where are we going?" I asked, trying to resist her grip.  
  
"To see your father," she said with a wicked grin.  
  
"My father? But he's dead too," I said, feeling a chill run down my spine.  
  
"No, he's not," she said as she pushed me into the room where I left the laptop.  
  
"He's right here."  
  
She pointed at the screen, where a new photo had appeared.  
  
It was a photo of my father, lying on a metal table with wires attached to his head.  
  
He looked pale and lifeless, except for his eyes.  
  
His eyes were wide open and staring right at me.  
  
He blinked once.  
  
And then he spoke.  
  
"Hello, son," he said in a voice that sounded like static.  
  
"We've missed you so much."
