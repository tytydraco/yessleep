It’s been three weeks since we buried my daughter.

She was six years old. Her name was Ana.

Most days, I still expect her to come running down the hallway barefoot, dragging that frayed stuffed bunny she named “Captain Pajamas,” shouting for cereal or cartoons or both. Sometimes I forget she’s gone until I reach for two plates at breakfast. Then I remember.

They said it was SUDC—Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood. No cause. No symptoms. Just… went to bed and didn’t wake up.

I don’t think that’s what happened.

Not anymore.

Because Ana is still here. Or… something that looks like her is.

And it wants us to believe she's come back.




It began with something small. You always hear people say that, right? That it starts quietly. So quiet that you don’t even notice it until it’s too late.

The first time was a week after the funeral. I was in the kitchen, washing dishes. My wife was at work. I was alone in the house.

It was around 5 in the afternoon. The kind of hour where shadows stretch long across the walls and everything looks like it's sinking in warm tea.

The kitchen window was open, just a crack.

That’s when I heard it.

A laugh.

Quick. Soft. Familiar.

Ana’s laugh.

The kind she used to do when she’d hide under the dining table during hide-and-seek.

I froze. My hands still underwater, one palm resting on a spoon. The sound had come from the backyard.

I leaned forward. Listened.

Then a voice.

Whispered, just loud enough to reach me.

“Daddy, I’m cold.”

I don’t remember getting outside. Just that I ran. Barefoot. Stumbled on a garden rock. Stared at the banana tree in the corner.

Nothing.

Just the wind pushing the swing slightly. The one she never used.

I stayed out there until the sun set, convincing myself that maybe a neighborhood kid was playing a prank. That maybe my brain filled in the gaps, wanted to hear her laugh again.

That night, I didn’t sleep.




The next day, I checked the footage. We have a camera installed by the back door.

At 2:14 AM, the video glitched—half a second of static. Then it flickered back.

And for just a moment, I saw her.

Standing. Still. Right in front of the camera.

She was wearing the same Minnie Mouse pajamas we buried her in. Her face wasn’t visible—tilted down—but her posture, her size… it was her.

But the eyes—when she lifted her head—were not right. Cloudy. Like someone had painted over the whites with diluted chalk.

I paused the video. Took screenshots.

By the time I tried to export the file, the footage had corrupted.

Gone.




I didn’t tell my wife right away. She was barely holding on as it was. She was crying in the shower most nights, thinking I couldn’t hear.

But things kept happening.

Her toys would be moved. Not just one or two. All of them. Arranged in perfect rows, as if she was mid-play and just got up to go to the bathroom.

One night, I came home from a late grocery run and found Captain Pajamas sitting in Ana’s highchair, facing the front door.

I had packed that toy away in a sealed box. In the closet.

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe my wife wanted to feel close to her. Maybe she unpacked it without realizing.

Then I heard her talking.




It was around 2 AM. The house was silent except for the buzz of the old fridge. I woke to a sound—whispers.

I walked toward Ana’s old room. The door was open.

My wife was sitting on the floor. Legs crossed. Talking to someone.

The lights were off.

I stood in the doorway, too afraid to speak.

She said:

“You can’t be her. She doesn’t twist like that.”

I flicked on the light.

She blinked up at me. Her face pale, like she'd just come out of cold water.

I asked her what she was doing. She looked down at her hands. They were muddy. Her fingernails packed with dirt.

“Was I… sleepwalking?” she asked.

We don’t have a garden. No mud inside the house.

I didn’t sleep that night either.




It’s getting worse now.

We both hear her.

Not every night. Just… enough.

She knocks. Three times. Same hour. 3:33 AM.

Never more. Never less.

Last night, I looked through the peephole.

There was a little girl standing outside our door.

Head lowered. Hair dripping. Skin the color of wet cement.

She whispered, in Ana’s voice:

“I found a body, Daddy. But it’s still warm. I can’t fit all the way in.”

My wife screamed.

We didn’t open the door.

When I checked the hallway cam in the morning, there was nothing there. But the front door had muddy handprints. Small ones.




This morning, I found a drawing on Ana’s chalkboard.

I haven’t seen that thing since before the funeral.

Stick figures. Four of them. Me. My wife. Ana. And something else.

The fourth figure was bigger. Darker. Drawn over and over, as if someone had pressed so hard the chalk snapped.

Underneath, scrawled in Ana’s handwriting:

“She says only one of us can stay. The others have to go underground.”




I don’t know what we let in.

I don’t think it’s a ghost.

I think it’s something that wears grief like a costume. That waits near the freshly dug earth. That smells the sadness on a home and moves in before the scent fades.

I tried blessing the house. I tried prayers. Salt. Burning sage.

Last night, my wife packed and left. Said she can’t take it anymore.

She’s not answering her phone.

And I just got a text from her number.

One photo.

Ana. Sitting on her lap in the car. Grinning. Eyes like cloudy milk.

The message:

“Guess who came with me?”

Don’t listen when they knock.

They aren’t coming home.

They’re only looking for a warmer shell.
