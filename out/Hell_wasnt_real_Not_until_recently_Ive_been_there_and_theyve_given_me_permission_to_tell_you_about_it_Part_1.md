**NSFW:** Brief depiction of self-harm. 

\- - - - - 

*“For the love of God, man, can we get this show on the road already?”* I grumbled, pacing restlessly around the cramped office.

The individual I was there to see, an older gentleman dressed in a navy blue pinstripe suit, looked up from his desk. I glared at him, intent on browbeating the civil servant into expediting my appointment. An ugly behavior, yes, but I had other shit to attend to.

Strangely, though, when I thought about it, my mind blanked on *exactly* what that “other shit” was.

He was decidedly unfazed by my attempt at intimidation, rolling a pair of bloodshot eyes at me before returning to whatever document he’d been wordlessly scribbling on for the past hour, snickering and whispering something under his breath.

Rage sizzled over my chest like a grease burn.

*“What did you just say?”* I muttered.

The man dropped his expensive-looking, quill-tipped pen and shrugged his shoulders, seemingly as frustrated as I was.

*“Listen, Tim, I’m waiting on you,”* he replied in a low, raspy voice.

I marched forward. My foot got caught on a ripple in the Persian rug that covered the floor, and I stumbled, bracing myself on the man’s desk as I fell, wrapping my fingers around its blunt edge. To my surprise, the surface was slick with something gelatinous. I retracted my hand in disgust and started shaking it, but the unknown oil remained stuck to my palm.

He chuckled at the sight.

Now within an arm’s reach of the man, I shoved my hand up to his face. That made him laugh even harder.

*“What the hell is on my hand?”* I barked.

*“No idea!”* He replied. The chuckling transitioned to full-on cackling. His cheeks became flushed from the elation, his breathing strained.

Slowly, I began pulling my hand away, but he yanked my palm back to his face with enough force that I needed to anchor my other hand onto the desk to avoid toppling over.

*“Hold on…hold on…let me take a look,”* he said. Initially, I was too stunned to separate my hand from his grasp. His cackling fizzled as he inspected the substance, sputtering to a stop over a few seconds. He brought my palm closer. When it was an inch from his nostrils, he began cartoonishly sniffing the viscous fluid, even going so far as to smear some of it over the bridge of his nose like it was sunscreen.

*“Well, Tim, if I had to make a wager, I’d say diesel.”*

I snapped out of it and jerked my hand out of his grip, lurching backwards to create some distance between me and the lunatic. I dragged both hands over my thighs, desperate to get the liquid off of me - even if that meant wiping it on my jeans.

But nothing came off.

I stared at my hand. Flipped it over and then back again, icy disbelief trickling through my veins like an IV drip.

Both palms were dry. Completely unvarnished.

*“What is this?”* I whispered, still gawking at my newly clean hands.

He didn’t answer me. When I looked up, the man had his head down, listlessly attending to the stack of documents on his desk, yawning as he scanned paper after paper. He’d gone from feverish cackling to utter indifference in the span of a few seconds. My brain throbbed from the whiplash.

*Why am I here?* I thought.

*“Hmm?”* the man said, seemingly in response to something I didn’t say out loud.

*“Why am I here?”* I repeated.

*“Oh, come now Tim, you know,”* he replied, monotone and disinterested.

But I didn’t know. Not consciously, at least.

I spun around, searching for *some* reminder of my purpose in that claustrophobic office.

The entire space couldn’t have been over eight hundred square feet, and that’s being generous. Oddly, it was built in the shape of an octagon, with a trio of doors at the three o’clock, six o’clock, and nine o’clock positions, and the desk stationed at twelve o’clock. Faint light spilled in from the sides of two small, square windows. Both were hidden behind blinds. Other than that, there were a few nondescript cardboard boxes overflowing with papers aside the desk and the bizarre Persian rug on the floor. None of that helped me determine where the hell I was.

I started to hyperventilate. Waves of vertigo undulated through my skull.

The gentleman released an explosive sigh. He appeared keenly aware of my growing panic, while also being distinctly irritated by it.

*“No need to fall victim to hysterics, my boy. Take a moment. You’ll realize that you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be. In the meantime, can I offer you some refreshments?”*

He slid his chair backwards and bent over, rummaging under his desk.

*“Just a little something to calm you down, something to make this all a little easier, if you know what I mean,”* he said, speech muffled but audible.

Then, I heard the rapid clinking of numerous hard pellets cascading against plastic emanating from under his desk, followed by the gurgling of water being poured into a glass.

When he reappeared, the man had one arm wrapped around a massive, semi-transparent bowl of mint Tic-Tacs and a bright orange sippy-cup in his other hand, still rambling on about how to properly express the intent of his *refreshments.*

*“Although, I wouldn’t say they’ll make this painless. Painless really isn’t the right word, even if it sounds right to you. Easier is close, but it’s also not quite right. Simple, merciful, streamlined, humane - they’re all close, too, but each one is just a bit off the mark. Language is funny like that, huh? So many words, and yet none of them are ever a perfect fit, not a single entry in the whole damn catalog, like we weren’t the ones who came up with the words to begin with. You’d think humanity would’ve had the entire spectrum of experience completely mapped out by now. Thousands and thousands of years evolving, expanding, inventing, and yet, we haven’t even come up with the right words to explain our motivations. Dismal, absolutely dismal. I mean, what good is a self-driving car or an intercontinental missile system that can accurately target and obliterate something as insignificant as a gnat - from four-thousand miles away, mind you - if we haven’t even developed enough language to adequately describe why we’d want to do such a thing in the first place? It’s a little ass-backwards. We’re building lavish mansions on a foundation made of driftwood and Elmer’s glue, so to speak.”*

He set the bowl and the sippy-cup on to the desk, slightly breathless from saying so much without pausing.

*“But, I digress. You’re not here for a sermon, right? You’re here to go home.”*

The man pushed both objects across the desk.

*“So…do what you know you need to do, and then I’ll give you the key.”*

He motioned to the door on his left, tilting his head and smirking. All three doors were identical - narrow partitions made of light pinewood with dull, brass knobs - save the one he was pointing out.

That brass doorknob shone with a dark orange glow, like it was redhot.

I ignored his cryptic speech and his insinuation that I should sear the skin from my palm by trying to twist the smoldering metal. Instead, I balled my hand into a fist and raised it into the air.

*“Tell me where* ***the fuck*** *I am or so help me God…”* I bellowed.

The man closed his eyes and massaged his temples.

*“Alright, Tim, settle down now,”* he said with resignation.

He stood up, shambled over to the two windows, clasped one drawstring in each hand, and then wearily rotated his head so he could see me.

I stepped back. My fist dissolved and my arm fell to my side. Wild terror thumped at the base of my skull.

*“What…what are you doing?”* I muttered.

He smiled, lips curling into an enthusiastic half crescent.

*“Well, please do correct me if I’m wrong here, but I believe that you just threatened me? In essence, I’m only reciprocating the gesture. Tit-for-tat, turnabout is fair play, et cetera, et cetera. You get the idea.”*

His eyes widened. His smile became even more animated, eventually appearing more like a painful muscle spasm than a grin.

*“Would you like to see?”* he rasped through a mouth full of grinding teeth.

I experienced layers of panic. Initially, the threat of him opening the blinds horrified me to my core. But, the more I thought about it, I didn’t even understand *what* I expected to see behind those windows, and *why* I was so afraid of it. That terrified me for a host of different reasons.

Before I could protest, he gently tugged on both drawstrings. The movement was so slight that it was nearly imperceptible, but that was still enough of a catalyst.

I sprinted to the door opposite the one with the burning knob, twisted it open, and ran through. As I did, I heard the man say one last thing:

*“See you when I see you, Tim.”*

The door clattered shut behind me, and I was alone.

I found myself in a narrow, musty-smelling passageway lit by a single, low-powered glass bulb hanging from the ceiling. My pace slowed and my mind raced.

*What was I doing before this?*

*How did I get here?*

*Where am I?*

*Why am I here?*

I let those questions echo around my head, undisturbed, unanswered. Dissecting them felt futile. In the end, the best course of action seemed to be the most straightforward one.

*Just escape.*

I picked up speed. My sneakers splashed in and out of puddles of what I supposed was water from leaky plumbing. Thirty or so footfalls later, I was in front of another door. Hesitantly, I grasped the knob, turned it, and slammed my shoulder against the wood, pushing it open.

What I discovered in that next room ripped the wind from my lungs.

Another octagonal office space.

Another man behind a desk, dawdling over paperwork with a pair of windows behind him.

Another rug and another two doors: one straight in front of me, and one to my left.

Another pair of windows that I would rather die than see behind.

It wasn’t a precise copy of the last room, and it wasn’t a precise copy of the man, but both were close.

His pinstripe suit was a little brighter, more azure than navy. The previous rug’s pattern was primarily floral, this one depicted a flock of birds flying over a snowy mountaintop. The boxes of papers aside the desk were dappled with moisture, soggy and crumpling, whereas the other ones had been bone dry.

He didn’t respond to my intrusion. Didn’t seem bothered in the least.

No, he just kept working.

I bolted past him, through the door straight ahead, and found myself in a distressingly familiar, damp hallway. At that point, I wasn’t even thinking. Not thinking anything useful or intelligible, anyway. I was simply running. Running until I found my way out or until my heart imploded in my chest, the first scenario being my ideal outcome. Truthfully, though, I would have been perfectly content with either.

The next door creaked open, and I prayed for something different. A lobby. A flight of stairs. The goddamned black pits of hell would have been preferable to another xerox of that office.

Of course, the room was similar to the room before it, but with its own trivial changes.

Couldn’t tell you precisely what those changes were. I didn’t stop long enough to commit them to memory. That time, I veered left instead of straight. Heaved the door open, hoping to find something other than a dank, poorly lit hallway on the other side.

Once again, no luck.

I charged through the passage, shoes and socks becoming thick with absorbed moisture, and stormed into the next room. The man behind the desk was wearing a crimson polo and brown khakis. I heard him cheerily whistling The Talking Heads’ *Burning Down The House* as I passed by, once again taking the left door. Then straight in the room that followed. Then straight for a few instances, followed by left for a few instances. After that, I began alternating.

Left.

Passageway.

Straight.

Passageway.

Left.

Passageway

So on and so on.

Objectively, it didn’t seem like I was getting anywhere with arbitrarily selecting which door to go through. You’d think I would have considered slowing down to come up with a better plan. All things considered, a re-evaluation of my approach to the hallucinogenic circumstances would have been wise. However, the horrific, ever-changing abstractions of the original office that I encountered as I progressed deeper into the repetitive labyrinth made it impossible to think clearly. Rising terror exorcised the demon of rationality from my mind.

You see, in the first room, everything was relatively normal, with a handful of subtle peculiarities bubbling beneath the facade. Same with the second room. In fact, I’m sure rooms one through ten were all reasonably aligned with reality. That said, they were incrementally transitioning into something far worse.

Let me provide you all with an example.

In the first room, the Persian rug was floral.

In the second, it had a flock of birds on it.

In the fortieth, the rug was replaced by a pelt made from my mother’s flayed skin. Her head was still attached, facing me as I entered the room. Two dead eyes tracked me as I ran, a pool of spittle forming around her gaping mouth, fetid saliva streaming over her pus-stained gums.

How about another example? Why not, right?

In a different room, the man was bare-ass naked and covered in thousands of self-inflicted paper cuts from the documents scattered over the desk. Each laceration had become a separate mouth, with the inflamed edges acting as lips. He didn’t say a word, but his injuries whispered to me: things I don’t feel comfortable publicly reproducing here.

So, excuse me for not thinking clearly.

In the room where I finally stopped to catch my breath, a hundred or so abstractions later, the desk and the rug were gone entirely. The man was laying face down on the barren floor, lines of termites crawling in and out of what appeared to be a bullet hole in his head. That time, he wasn’t wearing a suit, but he wasn’t naked, either. Instead, his clothes were made of the documents. which were covered in a language that seemed like the half-way point between Mandarin characters and Braille: all dots and swirls and curves.

I slumped to the floor, defeated, weeping like a child as I leaned my broken body against the wall.

At first, I collapsed in the area furthest from the man and his infestation. After a moment, though, I realized that put me only a few feet away from the shuttered windows.

They were worse.

I scrambled across the room on all fours, squashing several insects in my wake. When I got as far as I possibly could away from them, I shifted myself towards the wall, and I laid down. Eventually, the tears stopped flowing. I closed my eyes, and I waited for sleep to take me away.

I waited, and I waited, and I waited. Minutes turned to hours. Hours turned to days. Nothing. I felt exhausted. Hopelessly so. And yet, my consciousness would not quiet.

Sleep had abandoned me.

*“Am I dead?”* I whispered, still facing the wall, not expecting a response.

I heard a rustling across the room. Then, the soft tapping of feet against the floor. The sound kept getting louder. He was approaching from behind me. I felt the vibrations in my shoulder.

The tapping stopped. He bent down, and the floorboards whined. Termites sprinkled over me like raindrops.

I felt his lips touch the tip of my ear as he spoke.

*“Oh, Tim, no, you’re not dead. Think about what you’ve done. Consider the magnitude of your depravity. The profound extent of your sordid nature. Do you really think you’ve earned the luxury of death?*

I didn’t dare look. I stayed still. Played possum. Pretended I was dead. Figured I’d pretend until it finally came true.

I knew he was right, though.

Even if I didn’t *why* he was right.

I deserved to be there. 

Unfortunately, it would take years for me to remember why.

And until then, I was trapped.

Meds are running thin. Need to stop by the pharmacy.

Per our agreement, my recollection is due in three days.

Will finish before then.

If this isn’t to your liking, Mr. Walker, give me a call.
