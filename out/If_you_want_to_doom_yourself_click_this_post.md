Nobody knows what happens after death. many theorisers, theists, and atheists have had many retelling of the same story. Some say a man in a sky will grant you anything you want in the afterlife if you were a good person, give you tall mansions and live with an eternal never ending happiness. 

Some say eternal sleep occurs after death. Just infinite, peaceful sleep. 
Some say your remains merge with the soil to form new life, and while all these theories are all good fun and jolly, my grandfather had another story to say.

He had been hit by a car while crossing the road, and his heart had stopped for over 22 seconds. After this, he would wake up, crying and hysteric, like he was experiencing something fairly new. He had a streak of dementia after that. Couldn't seem to remember us for a while.


When we asked him what happened, he remained mum. Didn't speak to anyone. Did not come out of his room. Suddenly he wanted to live his life as healthy as possible. Shocking all of us, he began to go on a rigorous diet and became extra precautional about everything around him.

I never liked him really, and he never liked me. We were okay when i was a kid, but i accidentaly found out his affair with another woman. this made him despise me. one day i wanted to sit with him and talk about things.

"So." I said, propping a chair under me, staring into his eyes.
He was- dissheveled.
Even though he was extremely healthy after all the things he did to himself, my grandmother (now divorced from him) reminded me that he still had mental problems. on his hands were the remnants of white, greying hair, probably pulled from anxiety and stress.

He stared into my eyes back.
"What?" he asked in a raspy tired voice.
"Look, i know we aren't on good terms, but can you tell me what you saw when you died?" 
He just looked at me. i forgot the time i saw sympathy in his eyes. 
Was he... feeling bad for me?
"What is it"? I pryed again. "What did you see?" 

He looked at me, sighing and looking like he was about to burst or something.
"Well-" he began, but stopped himself.
He looked into my eyes again.
"Look, if you are just gonna stare at me all day long, i'm leaving." 
"No! wait!"
I turned to look at him.

He was still tugging at his hair, and he forced himself to say the words, 
"I saw... nothing."
"What?"
"Nothing."
My forehead creased.
What did he mean by that?
Huh.

I stormed out of his apartment, but too fast-
A car came at full speed and rammed into my stomach.
The only thing i remember was me being in a stretcher and getting dragged with my mom crying and my grandfather in the distance grinning at me.
Little shit.

I blacked out. That was it.
I blacked out. That was it.
That's....it?
i waited, for a long time, hoping to see some end of a tunnel or an afterlife, or ... anything, really.

But nothing came.
Nothing.
It was just me, me, me and me.
i was just... thinking.
i couldn't hear, i couldn't see, couldn't feel, couldn't hear, couldn't taste...
It was just me and my thoughts.
I dont know how long i was stuck there, because i blacked out for 220 seconds, but it felt like 220 million years.
Over time, i gradually lost... all memory of me. who i was, what i did, what i liked... 
BUT I JUST COULD NOT STOP THINKING.

No sleep, nothing. nothing to numb my thoughts.
My existence became plain. No memories to relive, no sense to enjoy-
What's that?

*YOU WERE PASSED THIS CURSE BY SOMEONE ELSE. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS FATE AFTER DEATH, YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM WHAT YOU SAW.*

The words shuddered in my- i dont even know if i had ears at that point. i was so lost in that point of time- 
Just trapped in my thoughts.
I said yes over and over again in my mind.
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes JUST GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HER-

I slowly hear the ventilator beeping. I wake up, and there were people standing over me. Who were they? what... did they want? 
After some time, I got used to them, the memories came back.
Unlike that little shit that the youth in my family call 'grandpa' i would never want my loved ones to suffer this.
I doomed you, Didn't I?
