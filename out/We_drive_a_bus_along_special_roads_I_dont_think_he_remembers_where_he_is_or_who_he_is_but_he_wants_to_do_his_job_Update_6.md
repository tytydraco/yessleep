**Trainee’s voice.**

The first thing I saw when we entered Goldsquare was the sign. It laid down a few specific rules: no littering. No open carrying. No line cutting. No smoking. No thieves. No recording. The mall chief’s word is final. Under these seven sentences there was something called the ‘declaration of independence’ nailed to the wooden post the blue-white mall sign’s square sat on. I think there were a lot of names on it, ones that I could actually remember, but they left my head the moment I left as far as I can tell.

It was a very strange place. Everyone was dressed very. Casually. No one in rags, no one in patched clothes. Everyone put on their best for this place, whether they were human or something else. I liked it, at first. There were many strange shops selling things I had never seen before, had only heard of in passing or in stories about the below. There was some place named after a being called a ‘panda’. There was a place for jewels that glittered, a place for clothes, a place for purchasing games.

I was drawn most to the exhibit. Next to a maze-like series of corridors, outside of which there was a sign declaring ‘laser tag’ could be played inside, there was a great statue of a woman in shining armor. Her face was concealed by a half-moon of darkness, and her garb was white as milk. She stood sentry next to a p-

**Driver:** You can’t say that word.

**Confused noises.**

**Driver:** Missile-shaped. Rocket. Language, if you don’t mind.

\-Missile-shaped vehicle. It was pointed towards the moon, which was currently a waxing crescent. We had been delayed teaching the… Ride-along we’d picked up manners. It hadn’t worked very well, but I think we’d made sufficient progress. Anyway, there was a sign next to the vehicle that said ‘rides for two dollars’. I noticed after seeing that that every place exchanges happened, including at these small machines containing little candy spheres, there was a sign reading ‘CASH ONLY, SEE EXCHANGE BOOTH’.

I pestered the Driver to explain it to me, and he looked at me like he was slowly making sense of a manual he was reading. He nodded after a bit, showed me to a particular place. We exchanged some of his old things for paper money, and he gave me some from his wallet. Said to ‘go ham’. I thought he was calling me a pig at first.

**Driver:** You ate like one. At the… Panda place.

**Thud.**

**Driver:** Ow! Hey, I’m old, don’t go smackin’ me like that!

We played the game with the light guns. We ate at one of the dining areas, I half-emptied one of the little colored candy ball holders. I obtained fresh clothes and a few jewels, for when… **Brief silence.** …For when the time comes. And at the end, we went back to the exhibit. The mall was much bigger than I’d expected on the inside. There were doors that lead to maintenance tunnels spaced between every few locations. There was a sign that led to some place called ‘extended housing’.

When I passed the tunnels, I thought I heard shifting paper and beating hearts. I even went towards one, opened one. But when I looked inside, when I checked to make sure nobody was following me or seeing what I was doing, nothing happened. They just went to places that made sense. I passed a gruff fellow eventually who stopped, turned, and grabbed me by the arm and escorted me out forcibly. He said something about ‘not wandering too close to the motel lines’. I have no idea what that meant, but he didn’t want me inside.

**Pause. Controlled breathing.** Why does everyone I…

**Driver:** You okay?

**Quiet period.** Yes.

The exhibit. The Driver wandered off a little, towards one of the shops. He seemed dazed, a little. When I went inside the exhibit, some audio played. It was some song about someone named Tom. I’d never heard it before, but somehow it felt familiar in a way that rested in my veins. My. Blood. I don’t know why. I was cold. The music was faint, and cut out after a bit. Inside the ship there were various displays. There was one about a landing on the moon and a flag. A moonbase of some kind. ‘Other monitoring’ was mentioned in the second display. I didn’t quite understand what it was talking about, but it sounded similar to a story I’ve heard.

There was a display about the woman. It told me her true name, and snippets of her history. It told me about a mission involving sending rabbits to the moon. Some of the information I learned is a blur now. It makes me upset. Such beautiful things, that I witnessed, being hid from me inside my own head.

**The Driver:** ...Hm. No, go on, don’t mind me. Just… Thinkin’.

I spent long enough in the exhibit that the bus driver eventually came and pulled me out. He gave me a strange look. Asked if I was okay. I think I was. I think it had been a very good day by that point. I had seen many things. Learned things. I’d asked him about the wall people he kept mentioning. He breathed out, put his fingers in his belt and swayed a little like he was wondering about that himself.

“It’s a place like this. I can’t… The name slips by me right now. But it’s like this. Just with less… Commercial focus.” He scratches his head.

“Is that somewhere we can go as well?”

He blinks. I briefly wonder if he is experiencing a stroke, which I understand is common to members of his background and age group. “I… You could. If you want. I could take you up to the wall, and I’m sure they’d pass you.”

“...But not you? Are you exiled?”

He looked at me like he wasn’t sure. I found it concerning. “I’m pretty sure I’m not. They always tell me I can go on in whenever I darn please. I just. Don’t.”

“Why? Isn’t it a good place?”

He looks up at the moon, visible through the glass ceiling in this portion of the building. “I don’t know. Probably. People always seem to be fussin’ about gettin’ over there. And I’ve heard of a lot less… Ugly laters, after I’ve dropped em’ off there. It’s always the little hurts. Not the… The big ones.” I see his eyes flicker to one of the maintenance doors.

**Seat creaking.** I’m gonna head down to rest. **Footsteps.** **Hatch opening and closing.**

“I’d like to go there with you.” I tell him. **Pause. Shuffling.**

“I…” He looks at me for a while. His eyes go wide at one point, I think I see his hand tremble. He adjusts his glasses. “...Maybe. I’ll need to think on it.” He looks back up. “Do you think it’s good up there?”

I stare at him.

“On the moon. All the places we haven’t been. It’s… Frightening around these parts, sometimes. Do you ever wish you could go somewhere where things are just. Quiet?”

“I’m not sure I like the quiet. But I like… Familiar noise.”

He moves over towards the entrance to the ship. My heart beats hard for a moment, and I go to stop him. Put my hand on his shoulder. I’m worried for a moment that, maybe, if he goes in there my obsessions will look silly. That maybe something I don’t want to hear will be said, or he’ll teach me something I don’t want to be taught. But I can’t think of anything to say, so he just looks at me and frowns, and I let him go in.

**Spliced recording. Trainee-Driver.**

**Trainee:** I heard her voice, then. When I looked up. She said that she’d gladly welcome me back. That a space had been set aside for me, and I would have all the love I’d ever need. That no one would have to leave me anymore.

**Driver:** I can hear her, talking up there. I met with the Mailman again. Like I said before, I can always get extras. I heard something quite a bit different. “Don’t let her outside during the full moon. I sent them down for a reason.”

**Trainee:** She said they’d have a new heart up there. For me. For Ori.

**Driver:** She said not to look at the moon when the stars are too bright, when you hear the moon’s music on the station. That it hurts up here. That it hurts a lot. That it’s lonely, and she has no idea how to get down.

**Trainee:** Do you believe in fairy tales? Let me tell you a secret. I think I’m from one. A real one. That there’s wonderful things and places out there, just for me and those I choose to go with me.

**Driver:** I think I’m getting a bit tired of losing passengers. I think it’s going to happen no matter what, that someone will get left behind, or I’ll drop them off somewhere they hate. But if I let her go, if nobody drives the bus, nobody at all will get where they need gettin’. I told her back then, I’d do my best to get her through things. I don’t usually do long term agreements, but I think I can make an exception here.

**Trainee:** I can’t stop believing her. I can’t. I don’t want to go, but I can’t not want to.

**Driver:** I believe people need to go where they want to go, not just where they’re headed. There’s a hell of a lot of difference.

**Lengthy silence exceeding twenty minutes. Soft breathing, wheezing. Brief, intermittent tearing of stitches. Sobs. Sewing.**

I should delete this. **Pause. Shuffling.**

**Original recording resumes.**

While I wait for the Driver to return, I notice a strange man driving around on a two-wheeled stick. He’s got a badge, a white shirt, and black pants. A big black tie. His head is shaved. When I listen to his heart, it beats older than he looks on the outside. It confuses me, so I watch him. He looks at me like I’m filthy, scrunches his face.

I wait for the Driver to come back out. I watch the strange man move around, making that same expression at everyone around him. No, not everyone. Just the people like me. The ones who don’t look like him. The ones who do, who have hearts that beat like mine. I get a strange thought in my head. I wonder what he knows about the exhibit. So I bite my lip and swallow my unease, and I wait till he’s still to approach him.

“Sir?”

He lets me wait a second. Then turns to me. “Shopper.” He nods at me, has a very serious face when he looks me up and down like he’s expecting claws.

“When was that installed?” I point to the ship. I watch the Driver emerge from it now.

“...Before your time.” He purses his lips, seems to struggle with something, then sighs. Some of that tension drains out of him. I can hear his heart running like a rollercoaster: half highs, half lows, like he doesn’t know whether or not he should be relaxed or alert.

“How long?”

“Maybe two decades. Three.” He pauses, adjusts his neck like he’s been stuck in one place for a long time. “Time is hard to keep track of. The clocks go by hour, not day. Calendars are never in date.” He pulls out some sort of stick, points at a clock on the wall. I don’t need the time, so I don’t look. I think, for some reason, this upsets him. He purses his lip again, like he was eating something sour. Heart goes fast, hand trembles slightly before he smacks it still.

He smiles at me, with white teeth. “Have a good day miss. Please observe the mall rules.” He drives off - scoots, rides? - and leaves me alone.

The driver comes up to me. “He seemed… Hm. Have I…” He waves a hand dismissively, shrugs, but I can tell it bothers him. His shoulders tense. “Weird. Don’t mind him, people get strange when they’re on the job for too long.”

“Should we look at the… Housing?”

He looks at me, raises his brows. “What for?”

“I think… I think I want to see how people live in strange places. Like this.”

He almost seems like he’s going to disapprove, but he sighs. “I don’t see why not.”

So we go there. And it is strange. The shops turn into… I believe I’d call them apartments. The wide doors become wooden, with little pads on them you have to type numbers into to get inside. Some have locks. A few have chains. I gather quickly that the ones with chains belong to people who really don’t want to be bothered. All of the windows are dark. Some have curtains, but most are just pitch black. The only thing I see through the darkness of their panes is hands or eyes. I think they have a way to look through, but I don’t really understand it.

I meet a man there wearing a crisp gray suit, who looks like the only state of being he is capable of existing in is veiled stress. He adjusts his tie, smiles perfectly, pulls out a pair of glasses and puts them on when he sees the bus driver. I think he could see without them. People are strange sometimes, with how they try to build rapport.

“Are you here to buy property? Looking for work? Looking to study the concepts of property and profession?” He asks us the questions rapid fire, though I realize after a moment he’s talking more to me than the driver. I notice his eyes pass over the bus driver in the same way you’d look at someone like you considered them a lost cause. Acknowledging, regarding, but not bothering with. I think I thumped my foot at that, since he frowned for a second before he smiled again.

“Slow down. You’re going too fast.” The Driver isn’t really looking at the man in the suit, his eyes are elsewhere.

“You don’t know the way of the land, if my intuition is correct. And to clarify, I’m not prying. Just have a hunch.” I stare at the man, so he sighs before continuing. “It’s safe here. Safe enough. As long as you follow human rules, not yours. Guaranteed privacy. Guaranteed accommodation. Guaranteed safety-” He adjusts his glasses, mutters the next bit. “-If you follow the rules.” He speaks clearly again. “-Considerable options for space, and many opportunities to prepare for entry into Society proper.” He looks at me, looks me in the eye. Cocks his head a little, considering. “You’re less likely to lose neighbors. And strangers can’t hurt you here.”

I breathe strangely, I think. He eyes me, steps forward just slightly and smiles wider. “Any interest, ma’am?”

My legs hurt. Like I’d been walking a long time. I frown, but I nod without thinking. I haven’t made any decisions, but I’m curious. The next half hour passes like a blur. I’m shown a strange space, that seems to go on longer than it should, make sense in dimensions where it shouldn’t. My every small wish - related to comfort - is granted. A bed made to fit me. A kitchen stocked with only what I’d like to eat. Dresses in the wardrobe. An ad for a job, conspicuously resting on the fridge attached to a magnet. The space feels… Grounded. Down to earth. No, just. Grounded.

I spoke with someone about phones. They seemed very excited by the idea of them, showed me a bunch of websites. I think they were saying things like. “The whole world at my fingertips.” “All these places, all these things!” “No one over my shoulder… They can’t hurt me here…” They spoke of consistency heavily. I don’t think they were local. I think I’d been making a friend. I don’t think it had anything to do with the man in the gray suit, though. I think it was just… How people were, around here, in places like this.

I wondered what was over the wall. I went to speak with the Driver about it, ask him what he thought of this place. Realized as I moved towards him he hadn’t moved from his previous stop, was standing wide-eyed and tense while he looked at something. I felt guilt for leaving him, then was perplexed by the cause of his frozen state.

There was a wall. Some kind of. I believe you’d call it a memorial. There was one up high, as well. Many like me - the whole ones, those who had fallen other ways - they had their names on it. Their true names. The dead no longer care for such things. There were many on this wall. It was made of granite. I looked across it, saw a list of particular jobs.

**IN HONOR OF THOSE WHO SAW POTENTIAL IN TOGETHERNESS.**

The driver was looking at a name with a J at the start. I felt like I shouldn’t know it. I craned my neck, after I looked away, when I saw the person I’d spoken to looking at it in a different kind of odd way. I asked them what was wrong.

“Why are so many of these blurry?”

When I looked back, I saw it. I hadn’t read them all. There were a lot. But many of them were… Indecipherable. I think the one the driver looked at had three letters next to it. The ones like that one were the ones most often fuzzy.

I shook his shoulder. I had to do it a few times, and he half-snapped out of it. He was in a daze. Had some focus, but just walked away from the great stone tablet. I wanted to ask him about it, but wasn’t sure if I should. I didn’t quite get the chance. We went to sit down on a bench, in front of a bubbling fountain. He stared into it, breathed awkwardly. I told him about the things I’d seen, but he wasn’t quite listening. Like he was somewhere else.

“...Why is this place new? I’ve been here before, but it feels new. But it’s old.” He was muttering something like that. I tried to find words, but someone else overrode mine and drove them from my head.

“Right when you walk in. It’s right there. On the sign. You can read, can’t you?”

When I looked over, I saw the man who’d been riding around on the wheeled hand-cart. He was standing next to someone who looked a lot like him, whose heart beat just the same. He was wearing a thick coat, a bit patched here and there. Torn gloves.

“Come on, man. Just give me a-”

“No littering.” The man in the black tie raised his stick, brought it down. I hear a crack. Everyone stopped to stare. Some people didn’t. I think the people who didn’t had been here longer. “No open carrying.” The man in the coat had fallen to the ground, cried out and put his hands over his head. The man with the stick pried his hands away, struck him again. “No line cutting.” Thud. “No thieves.” Crack. “No recording.” The next blow sounded wetter. The man in the coat was sobbing. “No. *Smoking*.” I saw the cigarette lit on the ground next to them. Watched the man with the stick stamp it out with a foot.

The driver finally looked up. I saw him scowl. I saw him stand up. I pulled him back down, my heart thudding painfully in my chest.

“I’m sorry, man. Please, for the love of g-” The man in the coat held up his hands, gesturing for mercy, but the man with the stick broke one of his fingers instead. Twisted it as he cried out.

I realized who the mall chief was. I think I’d expected someone larger. More like me. But I don’t think he needed to be like me to be strange. He picked up the man by the hood of his coat. He looked at the clock. Like he was trying to make it make sense. I think he gave up, was frustrated. “You’re coming with me. Some time in the tank will make you reasonable.”

I saw the mall chief start to drag the man off, bleeding and sobbing. Towards the maintenance doors. I noticed he had a ring of keys on his belt. He cursed, fiddled with them. I thought it was strange he had to bother, since the doors hadn’t been locked earlier. When he found his key, when he opened the door, it did not look like it went to the maintenance tunnels.

Someone pounded up behind him. I saw something out of the corner of my eye, something big that left a trail of red prints and droplets on the floor as it went. The trail was replaced by the sound of shoes squeaking against the black-white marble floor as they changed before I could understand, right as they crossed into my vision in full. It was a woman, whose heart beat in a way that made me sick. But it was fast. Angry.

The mall chief looked over his shoulder at her. Shook his head. “You could. You could. But I think we both know what happens if you disrupt the sense of order around here.” He leaned in to her. She was a little taller than him, but he acted like he was twice her size. “There’s a hell of a lot of things that could break here, with the wrong nudge.”

They stared each other down for a bit. I heard them breathe. Everyone else had averted their eyes, gone away, except the driver. He was holding my hand, I noticed, tight enough it hurt.

She walked away. The mall chief cut his victim’s pleading off by shutting the door behind him. Something told me that, somewhere beyond that door, someone would lose track of time. And someone would suffer for it.

I ran through the rest of the paper currency we’d obtained. It felt strange carrying it, all of a sudden. When we returned to the bus, I noticed the tension leave the bus driver like we’d never gone inside. Within the walls of that place, he’d seemed more… Aware, than he’d been before. Like everything both did and didn’t make sense, but because he understood instead of because he didn’t. Now all he did was ask me about the trip. I asked him a few things in turn. He remembered the things we’d gotten. Small parts.

But he didn’t remember the memorial. And he talked about Goldsquare like it was somewhere at the far end of the road, and not right behind us.

The woman from the mall came up to the bus after a bit, right when we were about to pull away. Said something about ground patrol. The driver looked surprised, asked her how she’d gotten hired so fast. I felt queasy. The woman looked at him in the sort of way that told me there was a gap in their interaction somehow. I’m not sure if I imagined it.

I started wondering what was in that package that was sitting under the bus now. But I don’t think it’s secrets belong to me. I’m not sure the things inside it are meant to be secrets at all. Maybe he forgot that something wasn’t.

If he listens to this, later, do you think he’ll remember? Do you think he should remember?

There’s a strange car with red and blue lights on the top at the far end of the treeline. And I think I hear something wet and dripping. Something with a very large heartbeat, that I think would be louder than a whole flock of birds taking to the sky. I don’t think he hears it, or has noticed the car. The woman is asleep on the bus. I think she’s waiting for something. She twitches while at rest.

**Drowning frog-thing noises.**

…I forgot you were here. Do you have any ideas?

**Choking spittle sounds.**
