The news has been entertaining lately, which is why my client doesn’t care that the TV is way too loud while I’m cutting his hair. Today, the fourth body was found; this time, the poor girl was missing her left ear. She kept fighting me; I had no choice. Looks like they’ve picked up the guy responsible for the gruesome murder. Sucks to lose another client, but what can you do? They’re all awful people who don’t keep their hands to themselves. I swear to God, if this guy rubs his head against my breast again, I might slip with these scissors. Luckily for him, I need him. I give him the best scalp massage money can buy; I have to make sure to get the hair by the root. Of course, he moans; they all do. As he gets up from the chair, he hands me my $20 bill, and I smile. “I’ll throw that water bottle away, sweetheart!” He starts for the door and turns around. “Any guy would be lucky to have you.” I feel bad for his wife, but she’ll be better off without him.

You see, it’s the men in my life that make me this way—primarily my husband. He cheats, and I kill them. This last little number was quite the piece of work; I could hear her while I stood in her closet: “Ohhh my God, he told me he loved me!” It was hard to stay quiet, but at this point, I’m a pro. I just wish she’d get the fuck off the phone; I have dinner reservations. I wish it didn’t have to be this way, but my hands are tied—kinda like hers will be. In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, I’m busting out of this door, and this is the way it will go—well, did go. They’re never quick enough, and that first slice right across the face is my favorite; not so pretty now. After that, I easily wrestled her to the ground and heard that click of the handcuffs—damn, that’s the best sound. As she whimpers, I slowly turn her over. “Recognize me, Abby, or is it Amanda? I can never keep it straight.” I don’t wait for the answer—dinner reservations and all. The last thing she sees is my shiny little knife as it comes down, over and over. One of these days, I’ll go too far and accidentally sever the head completely. Oh well... All done! I pull out my little bag of tricks, as I call it, and remove and deposit a few strands of hair and my half-empty water bottle. Sucks to be running late for pasta at Donatello’s; guess my husband can wait a few minutes for me. This was his fault, after all.

I arrive at the restaurant to find him waiting at our favorite table. He wipes the tiny drop of blood from my lips as he greets me. “Looks like someone already had a glass of Merlot,” he states as he licks his finger. I’m surrounded by idiots.

The End. Well, for tonight.
