&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was just enough time for us to hide in the stalls. As we each sat crouched in them my only silver lining was that there wasn’t anything on the seat.  I don’t recall my exact thoughts at that moment, but I think they went something like this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh shit. Oh fuck. We’re going to fucking die. Please, God, don’t let those things find us.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I imagine Calvin’s thoughts were similar. Whether by luck or some higher power, my wish was granted. A tentacle slithered underneath my stall and I tried making myself as small as possible. I was nearly discovered with it inches away from me. Sweat was dripping down my face when there was a crash from down the hall and the tentacle retracted.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The monster left the bathroom to check the source of the noise. When we determined it safe, we emerged from our stalls. Calvin was shaking all over and I was glad I’d taken a piss earlier.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The fuck was that?” he hoarsely whispered.

“I don’t know.  Let’s find Dustin and get out of here.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We made sure to stay low as we snuck through the halls.  Shrieking came from some of the classrooms and we kept our eyes ahead. It wasn’t as if there was anything we could have done.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What’s happening to them in there?” Calvin asked.

“I don’t want to know, come on.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We hauled ass up the stairs. Before we went into the health wing, we peeked through the door window.  More of those things were all over the hall. Seeing them fully, they kind of reminded me of  The Metroid Prime Core. Although, my mind was racing with questions they could wait.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“They’re everywhere,” I said. “I don’t know how we can get past them.”

“I might have an idea.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Calvin fished into his pocket and pulled out a rock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why do you have that?”

“I found it outside and thought it was funny because it’s shaped like a penis.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It did kind of resemble one. Under other circumstances, I would’ve found it amusing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, how does that help us?”

“We can use it as a distraction. I throw this thing. We wait for them to go to it and then we can slip safely by.”

“There’s one problem with that. We don’t know what part of the wing Dustin’s classroom is in”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Our window of opportunity wouldn’t be wide and we only had one chance.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Are you sure you don’t know who he has for this period?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Calvin racked his brain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“God, I don’t know. He doesn’t mention his classes that often.”

“Alright, I guess all we can do is hope we pick right then so which way do you want to go?”

“I think straight ahead is our best bet.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We each took deep breaths and then Calvin opened the door. He stuck his head in, making sure the coast was clear. Then he went in and threw the rock as hard as he could. It hit the trophy case at the end of the hall, causing it to come crashing down. The creatures flocked to it and we were able to get by undetected.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Start checking classrooms,” I said.

“I already am. Wait, this one is empty.”

“What?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I checked one as well and saw that it was also empty.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

‘Calvin, I thought you said he had health this period.”

Realization came over him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Shit, no, he has gym right now.”

“All the way back downstairs? Are you fucking kidding me?”

“At least the stairs going to it aren’t far.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With all the running around we were doing, we may as well have been doing laps.  The gym entrance was thankfully close by and we went in to find it in total darkness.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hello?” I hesitantly called out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Despite the cold, I felt beads of sweat rolling down my face.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Are they gone from here too?” Calvin whispered.

“No, that can’t be. The door was fine.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We went forward, struggling to perceive anything with our limited visibility. The next thing we knew, there was a yell and footsteps followed by something charging toward us. We screamed and fell back before lights were shone on us. Dustin was with some other students. They shone flashlights on us and he held an aluminum bat.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The fuck are you two doing here?” he asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were helped up and then we convinced him to speak with us in private. We told him our plan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You think I hadn’t already thought of that? I would have already left if my keys hadn’t been taken.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My heart went into my stomach.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What do you mean taken?” I asked.

“That fat bastard, Mr.Gilford took them after I called him a bitch. Then one of those things broke into the classroom and attacked him.”

“Wait,” Calvin interjected, “you were upstairs?”

“Yeah, do you think we’d stuck around after seeing those things? We came here because we figured it’d be the safest place.”

“So I was right.”

“Why didn’t you get your keys back?” I asked Dustin.

“Oh, right, I should have grabbed them from Mr.Gilford while he was being murdered.”

“Sorry, dumb question, but what the hell do we do now?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All we could do was wait for help and hope this all blew over.  We didn’t wait long. The doors opened again. We made sure to stay perfectly still and to our surprise, Mr.Gilford stood in the doorway.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I thought you said he was dead?” I whispered to Dustin.

“He was. I saw him get killed with my own eyes. That means this thing’s an impostor,” he replied and I sensed him tightening his grip on the bat. “Make sure to stay low. I’m going to be swinging hard.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The thing masquerading as Mr.Gilford came closer. Then once again the flashlights were turned on. Then Dustin swung the bat full force. Instead of hitting its mark, however, it was caught by Mr.Gilford and yanked away from Dustin. Mr.Gilford’s body suddenly jerked and bent at unnatural angles while he let out cricket-esque cries.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thinking we were about to be attacked, we were about to run to the exit. Then who else should come through the door except Principal Hogan, Vice Principal Fletcher, and the security guard from before as well as the other staff?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We’re trapped,” someone cried out.

“We’re going to get our fluids sucked out for sure,” another person shrieked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was it and I wish I could say I faced the situation with some dignity. The truth is I was about to break down and cry like a pussy, then beg and plead for my life. However, something happened none of us could have predicted.

“It’s alright, everyone. We do not wish you harm,” Principal Hogan said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My head spun and I thought I might pass out. I managed to get a hold of myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How the hell are you all still alive?” I blurted out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Principal Hogan only stared for a moment. Then he answered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We apologize for frightening you. Please, allow us to tell our story.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not seeing any other options, we obliged. The aliens told us they were passing by our galaxy when they were caught in an asteroid belt. Their ship was scuffed, causing them to hurl toward Earth, coincidentally crashing in the woods near our school.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Our species’ tolerance to cold is extremely low. Therefore, we needed a heat source. We figured since your peers were older they were the most expendable among you.”

“Wait so does that mean they’re all dead?” I asked.

“Sadly yes, again, we apologize for any grief this may have caused you. “

“How do you guys even take people over?” Calvin curiously inquired.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were going to regret him asking that question.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We’ll gladly show you to expand your knowledge of our physiology, but first even though we have taken these forms it is still quite cold to us. Might you know any means to make this facility warmer?”

“I mean, you could try the generator, but it’s snowed over.”

“It will be done momentarily.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The regular lights flickered to life suddenly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How the hell did you guys do that so fast?” Dustin asked.

“Our species’ minds are connected and therefore passing information is a simple matter. Now, I believe we owe you all a demonstration.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Someone was brought in we’d all only seen a few times.  It was Superintendent. Curt Hogan, Principal Hogan’s brother.  He was the main reason he was able to get away with what he did.  In exchange for a cut of the funding, he’d look the other way when it came to complaints.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What’s the meaning of this?”  he yelled, trying to struggle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He turned to who he thought was his brother and demanded to know if he’d lost his goddamn mind. Instead of answering,  Curt was held down and the gym door was opened where the last of the aliens in their true forms came inside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh, god and all that is holy,” he shrieked, “what the fuck is that thing?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All we could do was watch as the alien floated towards him. What it did next I can never forget. Its tentacles found their way into every orifice the man possessed. His cries were muffled as they wriggled through him and had it not been for the fact I hardly ate anything, I would have thrown up on the spot.  There was the sound of something inside him snapping and then his eyes rolled in the back of his head.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It took us a while to learn where the brains of your kind are located,” Principal Hogan explained. “Since we have that figured out, living among you shouldn’t be difficult. We are quite adept at adapting to customs.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The man who was once Curt Hogan sat up and blinked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How long exactly are you all going to stay like this?” I asked.

“Our bonds with species are permanent until the life within them expires.”

“Okay, so what should we do now then?”

“It seems these bodies require sustenance. Might you know where that may be obtained?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Calvin and I exchanged a knowing glance and then smiled. Later, the entire school was having a party with the confiscated food from the Teacher’s Lounge. Although these circumstances took some getting used to, it was ultimately for the better in the long run. We all agreed to keep this a secret. Due to the aliens’ aversion to cold, the infrastructure of the school was at last improved.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To top it all off,  we got an extra two days off while the other schools were getting ready to reopen.  All in all, I suppose everything worked out. However, two things have been seared into my mind. The first one is the image of the tentacles going into the superintendent's body. The second is of Principal Hogan with Vice Principal Fletcher.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even years later, those events keep me up at night. I’ve talked with Calvin about it and he’s advised me to get it off my chest which was my reason for writing this. I recently received an invite to a reunion of our high school. I wonder if [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) should [go?](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
