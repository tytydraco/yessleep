Look, I know how this sounds. “Tourist sees ghost, panics, writes Reddit post.”

But please—just read to the end. I haven’t been sleeping. I need to tell someone.
I need someone to tell me I imagined it all.

A few weeks ago, I went on my first solo trip to Japan. I’m 36, from London, and honestly, it was supposed to be a bit of a reset. Work stress. Breakup. Life stuff.
I had this mix planned—temples, anime shops, themed cafés. Just the usual basic itinerary.

That night in Shibuya, I was hunting for this ramen place someone posted about. I got lost—phone at 6%, walking in circles, drowning in neon and noise.

That’s when I heard it.

J-pop. High-pitched, sugar-sweet. Echoing faintly from a narrow alley I must’ve passed three times already.
I probably wouldn’t have noticed it if everything else hadn’t gone quiet.
Like the city took a breath.

The alley was narrow, damp. One flickering sign above a rusted metal door:

LIVE HOUSE HIKARI

Red paint. Peeling in long, curling strips, like it had been scorched.
I should’ve walked away. I really should’ve.

But I didn’t.

Inside was a small live house—low ceiling, haze of smoke machines, stage lights flickering pink and blue. About ten people stood near the stage. All men. In colourful t-shirts.
They waved glowsticks in perfect, silent unison.

They didn't notice me enter and stumble onto the live floor. They were too busy moving. Like Clockwork.

Onstage were five girls. Matching pastel uniforms—frills, bows, glitter. Beaming faces with well trained smiles.
They danced like their lives depended on it, with a hint of hopeful desperation.

I was mesmerized at first but soon noticed something was off.

One girl’s arm lagged during choreo and swung like it wasn’t properly attached. Another’s hair clung to her face and blocked her version, plasticky and stiff, almost like a wig on a mannequin.

I told myself to cut them some slack, it was a low-budget act after all and I'm far too jetlagged to be nit-picking right now.

During their MC segment, the mic shrieked—feedback so sharp I winced. Then this snap, like a branch breaking—or dry wood catching fire.

The lights stuttered.

No one reacted, I guessed they are used to the cheap equipment used at venues like this.

And so the show continued

I clapped when the others clapped. Cheered when they did too.
I even bought a glowstick from the back—an overflowing merch table near the rear wall.

It all felt strangely normal. Like a dream you don’t know is a nightmare until you try to wake up.

At one point, I turned around to look for the toilets and gazed around trying to locate the exit, something in me telling me maybe it was time to leave, but all I could see was darkness.

When I looked back, one of the idols was staring not at the audience, but this time directly at me.

Her eyes.They didn’t blink. Didn’t move.
Glass-like. Fixed on me.

Her lips started to move, shaping words I couldn't hear—words that didn’t match the song still echoing in my ears. Her expression twisted, first into confusion, then fear, and finally into something far worse. 

Her mouth stretched unnaturally wide, as if mid-scream, though no sound escaped—the sparkly bubblegum like song kept playing, like it didn’t notice she was breaking.

Then the lights shifted. The crowd cheered. The moment passed.

I left right before the encore. The door was there again—red, warped, heat-blistered.

Out on the street, everything felt too loud. Too real. I needed normal.

I Found the ramen place eventually, just a block or two away. I sat down at the counter, tried to breathe.

My jacket stank. Not like cigarette smoke—more like… burnt hair. And something plasticky.

The man next to me—a middle-aged guy drinking alone—glanced at me. Then did a double take. Like he recognized something.

Trying to shake it off, I asked, “do you know Live House Hikari?  Idol show?."

He froze.

Didn’t blink. Didn’t speak.

Then, slowly, he picked up his phone. Typed something. Handed it to me.

 “TRAGIC INFERNO AT SHIBUYA IDOL SHOW — LIVE HOUSE HIKARI CLOSED AFTER FATAL FIRE”

Seventeen dead.
Nine injured.
Six years ago.

A faulty stage light. Fire mid-performance. Merch tables blocked the exits.
The idols never made it out.

Some fans tried. Some lived—with life changing burns.

The building was condemned. Torn down.

“I was there,” I said. “Tonight.”

He didn’t react. Took a slow sip of beer. Then looked me in the eye and said—
very softly, almost apologetically:

“They... they remember who clapped.”

I didn’t finish my food. I barely made it back to the hotel. That night, I woke up choking, like the room was thick with smoke. Tongue dry. Ash on my breath.

I threw my jacket in the tub and scrubbed my skin until it hurt.

Since then—things haven’t gone back to normal.

Even in London that song haunts me.
That same warped melody. Off-key. Melting.

I see them. In reflections. In train windows. Behind glass.

A flicker of pastel. A pair of eyes that don’t blink.

Once, on the Tube, I looked up and one was sitting across from me.

She smiled.
Her teeth were black.

Am I losing my mind? 

The jacket? I binned it. 
It still smelled like burnt plastic. 

It smelt like…
melted flesh.

The glowstick?

The one I bought at the show?

It was on my dresser this morning.

Still glowing.

I swear I can hear them even as I write this.

I got a friend to translate the only line I can make out fully...

“We’ll burn so bright… forever in your heart~”

I'll never clap again.
