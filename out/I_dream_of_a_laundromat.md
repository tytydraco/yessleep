Has anyone dreamed of a laundromat? 

I know it sounds crazy, and I know people have lucid dreamed, and I am not one of those people. Honestly, it scares me a bit, and I get scared that I won’t be able to wake myself up. 

I dream of standing by a dryer, the second one from the left, top row, and my clothes are drying. They’re my clothes, because my dream tells me. 

You know how in your dreams, if you’re not LUCID dreaming, your body and mind just know things? Sometimes you’ll talk to someone you’ve never seen before, and know exactly where they’re from, who they are, what they are? No one explicitly tells you. But you know? 

It depends though, because sometimes in this dream, I’m waiting for something, but it’s not my clothes to be finished. But I can’t ever pinpoint exactly what I’m waiting for. 

Sometimes the mat will have a very checkered color scheme, very 50s almost. Or sometimes pink, like BARBIE pink. But still with that 50s checkered aesthetic. But switch the black with pink. And if I’m gonna be honest. It’s visually pleasing, and because of this dream, I’m starting to like the color pink. 

I’m comfortable in my dream, which is odd, because not only am I waiting for something to happen, the people around me are. Yeah, in my dream I’m surrounded by people, mostly behind me. Which seems odd, because I physically can’t move myself to look around. But I KNOW there are people waiting around me too. Waiting for me. And although not anxiety inducing in my dream, I have this weird fear that they’re gonna pop up randomly in my life.

I try to tell my best friend, my roommate about it, but everyone who’s had a normal dream before knows you almost NEVER remember all of it. In fact, writing this I remembered a few things I didn’t inherently remember at the start. Specifically the people waiting around me, and the fact that the first few times I had this dream, the aesthetic of the building was very 50s theme. The linoleum tiles, the shaking overhead lights. The almost muted sound of my environment. But I remembered the comfort, and the lack of urgency. 

Anyways, I try to tell my friend, and I can’t go beyond anything specific. In the back of my mind, something ends up happening. But I don’t know what yet. Whenever I say “had that dream again.” She just nods and says “that’s rough.”

I’m thinking about trying out lucid dreaming. I want to get to the bottom of this for my own sake, because if this is the only damn thing I’m gonna be dreaming of at night for the rest of my life. Then damn, I’m gonna have a pretty boring ass life. 

It’s been going on for about six weeks, I can’t exactly say when it started, because I don’t know. But has anyone experienced something like this? Should I start writing this down? I stopped taking my medication because I was thinking that the meds were causing the dream, but I don’t know, it’s only been four weeks since I stopped cold turkey. 

I hope this wasn’t too short. I hope I’m not weird. But please help me. I’m confused, and a wee bit scared. 

I’m setting this as a series flair just in case something different happens. I’ll update soon (hopefully!!)
