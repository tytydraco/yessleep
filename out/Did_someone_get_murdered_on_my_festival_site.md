Hey! So this is sounding crazy, but this felt like the best place to post it and see if anyone else has heard of these things. Please forgive my English if that is ok, I am living near Zelik in Slovenia. 

There is not a lot of work now, but this company came into town and the woman said they needed builders to help them for a festival. They were English, but they don’t speak Slovenian so we are translating everything and maybe I missed something. It all seem very legit at first. When we get there, immediately I thought the security was too much. Not only did they search us going in and coming out, but they made us lock our phones in a locker while we work. I think maybe this is fine, maybe they've got some big English celebrities coming and they're just being crazy about it. 

We're working all day right so we're gonna have to take a piss At some point. But there is no toilets. I think maybe they had not brought them yet for the festival. So I walk away a while to the woods and I take a piss. That's when I hear screaming- like a man screaming. It was really loud, like he was hurt really badly, and then it just stopped. I ran back to my boss and told him what I heard and he told me to ignore it, that I must have imagined this thing. I thought we must see if somebody needs help, that this guy sounded like he was hurt. But then my boss told me to go home for the day and not come back. It was good money, but to be honest I'm happy I didn't have to go back. That screaming I do not think I will forget it. I worry for him, and I think maybe I should have done something more. 

It's been a couple of weeks and last weekend, me and some friends decide to go back to the site and check it out. We've heard about tents and bicycles and these things being left by English festivals and we thought maybe we could sell them rather than all of it wasted. Maybe also I thought I could check if there was any sign of the man who screamed. But when we got there, it was gone. I mean, there was this big house before and now there is nothing. It was just gone. I know the festival happened because my friend drove a bus there from the station full of English people. I guess what I wondered was have any of you know a English festival in Slovenia? Camp Exodum, I heard someone call the woman who hired us Ms Deveraux, which maybe is French but she sounded English? 

Really, I just want peace to know this guy was ok and that I did not ignore a person being hurt. If anyone knows what I’m talking on, DM me.
