I work in a hospital, delivering medications to nursing stations and patient rooms. Honestly, it's a pretty chill job. Most of the time, I just pop in an earbud and listen to audiobooks or music, depending on how I'm feeling. What most people don't know is that there are more floors to a hospital than are listed on the elevator. There are floors in between the listed floors. Some of them require specific elevators or special access badges to get in. Some of those floors are for things like dressing rooms or HVAC, but in my hospital, there are other floors set aside for less...conventional patients. Those are the floors I make my deliveries to.

Honestly, the in-between floors are kind of a pain to deal with, but after I proved I wasn't going to run away or disappear like most of the rest, the hospital admins threw enough money at me to make it worth my while to stick around. Apparently, the position has a high turnover rate for some reason. I don't know why, like I said, all I really do is zone out and make my rounds.

By unofficial policy, we're only allowed to use one earbud at a time, so that we still have an ear free and can hear if someone else, like a doctor, nurse, or patient, needs to get our attention. The official policy is that we can't have earbuds, but they gave up enforcing it a long time ago. This is mainly because they need someone to stick around, and no one would without something to make the hours pass just a little more quickly. Still, only getting to use one earbud is a bit more annoying on the in-between floors. It means you still have to deal with the screams, the insane laughter, and...the voices. For the most part, I try to ignore the background noise. After all, my job is to get in, deliver the meds, and get out as unobtrusively as possible. So when I hear someone shouting something like, "OH GOD! WHAT *IS* THAT THING? IT'S GETTING CLOSER! OH GOD! SOMEONE, ANYONE, HELP!!!" I just do my best to keep my head down and do my job.

Most of my coworkers aren't that noteworthy. There's the usual lot. The long-timers complain that kids these days aren't willing to work ninety hours a week like they used to three marriages ago, the newbies who optimistically believe working in healthcare still means helping people rather than padding the pockets of the board of directors, the big, scary tattooed guy, who it turns out, takes care of all the neighborhood strays in his free time, paying for their vet bills out of his own pocket, the tech that seems like he's running his own...unofficial pharmacy at his house, but somehow passes every "random" drug test he's given, and so on.

Then there's the night crew. That job takes a special type of person. And by special, I mean crazy, and by people...well, I should probably leave it at that. Of particular note is my counterpart, Milton. He handles the in-between floors at night. The guy's been at it longer than I have and never seems any the worse for wear. In fact, as insane as it sounds, I think he *likes* his job. Trust me, that should genuinely scare you. No one, and I mean *no one*, likes working in a hospital after they've been there long enough. Sure, some people might smile and pretend like they do, but those smiles always hover somewhere between hollow and malicious. However, Milton seems genuinely happy and eager to be there. Okay, yes, maybe happy isn't quite as accurate as saying manic, and yes, there's also some of the malice I mentioned earlier... But what I'm trying to say is that I think the man genuinely looks forward to clocking in every day, which isn't normal *or* healthy.

Still, at least Milton seems to like me. He even talks with me some days, asks me how my shift went, and so on. I try to answer him as politely and succinctly as possible. After all, you do not want to get on the bad side of someone who happily works the night shift on the in-between floors. For one thing, if it came to a dispute, he's more valuable than me, so admin will take his side, and for another...well, let's just say the fewer details you know about that man, the happier and longer your life is likely to be. I'm pretty sure I've seen him in the surgical rooms on more than one occasion, and I don't think he was scheduled or qualified to be there...

Then there's the rest of the hospital staff. One of the other unspoken rules is to stay on the good side of the janitorial staff. Seriously, if you get on their bad side, life is gonna be rough for you. You piss off the janitors, and every cart you get your hands on will pull to the left, have a squeaky wheel or three, and the messes on your floors will somehow always have a lower priority for being dealt with. You do NOT want to be dodging all those blood (and other bodily fluid) pools all shift long! To be fair, even if you stay on their good side, that'll still happen about half your shifts, but half is better than all! The other primary group you have to deal with as a pharm tech is the nurses.

For the most part, the nurses will ignore you unless, of course, they don't. They always want you to hurry up and deliver the meds, complaining when they haven't arrived five minutes after the order was placed, even though a single delivery round takes almost an hour from start to finish. After all, one tech usually covers anywhere from six to twelve floors. Adding in the time it takes to sort and prep the meds, find equipment that isn't in the middle of breaking down, and wait for access to the Pyxis machines, etc., you're lucky the meds got where they were needed before they expired! At the same time, they complain that you're always in the way, delivering the very meds they called for!

Of course, for the most part, the best way to diffuse either situation is simple. You just apologize, then redirect all the anger and resentment they built up working with troublesome patients to the most universally hated people in the hospital: the admins, who usually deserve it. Simply complaining about being short-staffed or how all the equipment we're using is holding on by a shoestring, while noting that admin never seems to miss a bonus, will do the job. Then the two of us can commiserate together about how badly we're mistreated while I finish up my deliveries and get on my way.

Of course, while that's all true for the normal floors, on the in-between floors, things can get a little more...tricky. For instance, on the in-between cardio floors, in the J building, the nurses are all surprisingly attractive and much friendlier. They'll even ask you for your number or if you want to hang out after work. However, I never take them up on it. I've got too much on my hands as is. Between my cats, my computer, and my books, who has free time to hang out with a bunch of oddly sexy nurses who all have novelty drink pouches that look like blood transfusion bags? Admittedly, when they look you in the eyes, you might find yourself agreeing to whatever they say. Probably something to do with how unnaturally good they all look. But luckily, that's easy enough to deal with by texting excuses like, "My cat threw up on my clothes, gotta stay home and do laundry instead. Sorry!"

Admittedly, there is one nurse I can't get out of my mind. Nurse Angela. She has an unearthly beauty that leaves me wondering if her name is more than just a passing reference to a celestial being. And before you get all judgmental, I'm not the only one who thinks that! Every time she leaves a room, I notice the body of the patient inside has a smile of blissful happiness and contentment on it, as though their final moments had been the high point of their lives. For the most part, I try to treat her the same way I do any nurse, which is to say I try to stay out of her way and get my job done as unobtrusively as possible. But lately she'd been giving me glances, and even smiling in my direction from time to time. I have no idea what that means, but it certainly brightens my day when it happens! Of course, there's no way I could ever bring myself to talk to her. That would be like a three-toed sloth chatting up a beauty queen who was in the middle of curing cancer while solving world hunger, but I enjoy the little radiance I can get by proximity when I pass by.

Then, of course, there's Mike. He's both the best and worst part of my day. I love stopping to talk to Mike! He's so friendly and understanding. He'll commiserate with you about pretty much anything, and is always appreciative of all the hard work you put in while talking you up and saying things like, "I bet that nurse Angela is gonna ask you out any day now!" Just chatting with him is always the best part of every day, even on days when admin gets off their rear ends and does something to help, like ordering new scanners for the pharmacy! Of course, the worst part of the day comes right afterward when I have to kill him...again. You'd think I'd get used to it. He doesn't even complain! Usually, I just snap his neck and wheel him back to the morgue. Sometimes he'll even compliment me the next day, telling me how I did it so quickly and cleanly that he didn't even feel the incomprehensible agony and terror that he drowns in every time someone murders him. Mike's a good guy.

So yeah, life is pretty much what you'd expect at the hospital. If you all like, maybe I can run you through a day or two, so you can really see what it's like. Not that it's all that exciting; after all, it's really just another job, like any other. But if it sounds like it might be interesting, let me know, and maybe I'll tell you a little more about [what I do.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/authors/drblackjack21/)
