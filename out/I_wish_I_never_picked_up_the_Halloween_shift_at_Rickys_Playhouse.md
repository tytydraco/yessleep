I had picked up the Halloween shift at Ricky’s Playhouse, which I wasn’t thrilled about, but I needed the extra scratch. If it wasn’t my car breaking down, it was always something else. We were going to be open until trick or treating started, and then we’d be closing shortly after that, which didn’t seem so bad. We had to just hand out some candy, look happy, and say "Happy Halloween!" on top of the normal stuff, like kids breaking shit, parents yelling, and Mr. Vinny, the manager, being a giant pain in the ass.

Mr. Vinny, always the cheapskate, threw some plastic skeletons around the lobby, sprayed some fake webs around the machines, put out a plastic pumpkin or two, and said it was "Good enough". I had tried to move one of the skeletons that was in the middle of the floor and seemed more like a safety hazard than anything, but Mr. Vinny told me to leave it as it added “ambiance”.

“Know what happened? Some kid tried to cheat and got vaporized. That’s the… what do you kids say? Lore? Ricky the Rat came down from the ceiling and fuckin' WHAMMO!!! He lit this kid UP! I dare one of those fuckos on Youtube to come up with something as good as that theory!"

Mr. Vinny was a bit crass.

I was a senior in high school and my days of pounding the pavement for sugary treats were unfortunately over, though I did still think about wearing a costume that obscured my entire body and wondered if that would be enough to make me resemble a child again. Surely someone out there trick or treated way past their prime, right??

I was on the taller side, but not so tall that I couldn’t resemble one of those lanky and awkward 8^(th) graders lagging behind their friends and mumbling as they thrust their pillow sack forward for some crispy treats.

I felt myself salivating a little. How embarrassing! I straightened the pumpkin costume that Mr. Vinny made me don as soon as I walked through the door. I protested – noticing the pizza sauce stains and other questionable markings, but he insisted.

“Rachel, put on the costume. Don’t make me break-a your legs,” he said, and then, catching the worried eyes of some nearby parents, went “Kidding! Totally kidding!”

One of my friends, April, was working the same shift, and was dressed as Petey The Pirate – one of the chain’s mascots, but the costume was woefully simple and barely resembled a pirate parrot, other than the yellow beak on her nose and the pirate hat on her head. I envied her. The lumpy pumpkin costume was already becoming a pain in my ass. I had to keep adjusting it. The pumpkin hat kept messing up my hair and falling off my head, and the arm and leg holes for the pumpkin body were way too big for me.

I was commiserating with April when a child strolled through the doors. He seemed to be alone at first, but then a mom and dad tagged along behind him, their faces plastered with grins that unnerved me. The kid was wearing a blue party hat that said *BIRTHDAY BOY!* on it in bright, golden letters.

“Hi,” I said, leaning down to talk with the birthday boy. “Welcome to Ricky’s Playhouse – Pizza Plaza and Prize Emporium! Is it your birthday today?”

The kid looked at me, then glanced at my name tag. He pulled it off my pumpkin costume.

“Hey, you-“

“Silence,” said the boy, and I felt my mouth close.

I tried to speak again but found that my lips wouldn’t move. A cold sweat came over me. Was I having a stroke? I reached with my fingers, pulled at the skin, but my lips felt like they were bolted shut. Immovable.

April looked at me in confusion, but then rounded on the kid. “Hey, give Rachel her name tag back. That wasn’t very nice, little dude.”

The boy glared at her. Then he reached up and grabbed her yellow beak, pulled it back, and let it go with a snap.

“Owwww!” April howled, reaching gingerly for her nose. There was a red line forming across her face from where the elastic had snapped. I heard some chatter from the other children and parents running around the place, but most of them ignored what was happening in the lobby.

The parents behind the child failed to act, they kept looking on with deranged grins. I saw now that their eyes looked unnaturally wide, red and irritated. Like they had been holding their eyes open for way too long and it was starting to hurt.

“My name is William,” the boy announced, “and I have come for your pizza, prizes, all that you possess – and more. Fail to make me happy, and you will regret the day you were born.”

Hearing the kerfuffle, Ace the Mouse wondered over to the lobby. There was a slew of questionably generic mascots at Ricky’s Playhouse that definitely didn’t resemble another place with a similar name. There was Ricky the Rat, Petey the Pirate, and Ace the Mouse. I guess Ace missed the memo about alliteration?

Ace was a full body suit character, a white mouse with a comically large head and a short red cape tied to his back and not much else. I couldn’t tell who was in the costume today, but from the voice, it sounded like Jeremy.

“Heeeeey birthday boy, what’s causing all the commotion?”

I noticed that one of the theme songs had been turned up on the overhead radio, probably a move by Mr. Vinny to distract from our problematic birthday boy. *RICKY RAT, RICKY RAT IS HAVING LOTS OF FUN! RICKY RAT, RICKY RAT! WON’T YOU COME AND PLAY A TON?*

William whispered something into Ace’s large ear. Ace moved silently to the supply closet where he pulled out a step ladder and some tangled electrical cord. To my horror, Ace climbed the step ladder and threw the cord over a beam along the ceiling then shoved his oversized mouse head into the loop. He kicked off the ladder and the cord, attached to a vacuum in the closet, went taut for a brief second before the vacuum zipped free, banging against the wall.

The overstuffed mouse head rolled off of the costume and fell to the floor, along with Jeremy.

“Oh, of course it’s just a costume,” said William. “Silly me! Try that again.”

Jeremy was about to mount the ladder again when William’s dad finally spoke up.

“Hey…. SON!” he said, as if he hadn’t been able to talk for hours. “Why don’t we… go to the PARTY ROOM instead?”

William looked annoyed but not entirely displeased.

“Rachel,” said William. “Lock the doors. Mouse boy, go to the party room. Start dancing. Mother, father, round up my playmates.” And then, his voice lowered, changing several octaves. “Everyone is to do as I say. Everyone. There will be no phones, no interruptions, no deviations. This is my birthday party and everyone will celebrate me, William, the birthday boy until their dying breath. Pizza. I desire lots of pizza."

Tears were rolling around in Jeremy’s eyes as he followed William to the party room. I looked over at April who was walking to the kitchen now. Searching through the crowd, I found Mr. Vinny who was standing firm over the prize table, apparently ignorant to what had just transpired.

He glanced at me from under his thick mustache and oily black hair. “You look like shit, Rachel.”

I choked back a sob as my hands reached for the key ring around Mr. Vinny’s waist.

“Hey!” he said. “The fuck you grabbing my keys for? You wanna get fired on Halloween?”

My lips finally opened. I felt a bit of skin tear from the force that been holding them closed and I winced in pain. Blood trickled down my chin. “William the Birthday Boy has spoken,” I said. “There will be no further interruptions to his birthday party.”

Mr. Vinny snorted. “Are you fucking high, kid? You fuckin’ showed up high on Halloween to my party establishment? Ricky the Rat would be so ashamed of you.”

I found my legs moving away from Mr. Vinny, keys in hand. I was on autopilot and despite trying to move in any direction other than the one my feet were going, I couldn’t stop. I slid the keys into the front doors and locked them closed, then pulled a curtain closed over the glass doors, obscuring the outside parking lot from view.

The arcade floor was now empty, and I couldn’t see any other families running around.

My feet turned around, and I found myself moving towards the kitchen where the aroma of freshly baked pizza would have made my stomach growl if I didn’t feel so terrified.

April was holding two trays full of pizza and her arms were trembling. The pizzas were hot and I could tell the metal was scalding her arms. The workers in the kitchen mindlessly tossed the dough and flung more pizzas into the oven. They didn’t look up from their work, and I saw one worker’s arms covered in burns from the pizza oven.

I picked up a tray of pizza and walked along side April to the back party room where the Ricky Rat song was now blaring at full volume. “Don’t… make him mad,” April wheezed. “Don’t make him mad and maybe… we can… eventually go home!”

I tried to speak and found that I could. Maybe there was a range to his influence or maybe he had to be focused or-

“I have the keys to the front,” I grunted. “We could… maybe escape but-!”

April shook her head, tears falling. “No, no! Don’t make him mad! He’ll hurt you, he’ll hurt you! He’ll-“

We made it to the party room and I really, really wish we hadn’t. William was sitting in one of the chairs, scrolling through some phones he must have collected. All of the other children were lined up against the back wall and staring at the wall. They made no sound. Didn’t move. They were like statues. Jeremy was dancing in the other corner, his face full of tears and perspiration. *RICKY RAT, RICKY RAT IS HAVING LOTS OF FUN! RICKY RAT, RICKY RAT!*

William’s father was bashing his head into the wall, his nose broken, bloody, and little more than a knub. I shrieked and William glared up at me.

“Rachel! Don’t get upset, these aren’t my real parents!” he said, laughing. “Oh, Jeremy, is this your girlfriend?” He showed the phone to Jeremy who winded and in pain, nodded.

“Dear Susan,” said William, his mouth contorting into a frightening grin as his little thumbs typed on the screen. “I think you are the worst person I’ve ever met. I hate you. Please delete my number and never contact me again. You smell like a landfill and are about as pretty as one.” William cackled and threw Jeremy’s phone at the wall so hard that it broke. Jeremy shook his head, his face pale.

 “What?” asked William. “Keep dancing or you’re going back up the step ladder.”

William turned his attention to us. The bloodied corpse of his father had slid down the wall and was now silent on the floor. “Oh, pizza pizza pizza! It's pizza time!” William cheered. He seized the pizza from our hands and started to wolf it down ravenously. Meat, cheese, and toppings flying all over the tablecloth. Marinara sauce rolled down his chin like blood as he feasted.

I didn’t know where the other parents had gone. I imagined them all stashed in a closet or bathroom somewhere for further play, all of them silently staring at the wall just like the other kids. I tried to turn to leave the room but William rounded on me.

“Rachel!” he said, pounded his fists on the table. “Let’s go play! Bring me to the arcade!”

My feet carried me to William’s side and my hand shot out and grabbed his gross, pizza-covered mitt. I saw April now turning to face the wall, like a robot being decommissioned. We walked to the arcade, and William finally let go as he zipped from machine to machine, craning over them and looking at all the flickering lights.

The stupid, stupid song bounced around in my head, *RICKY RAT, RICKY RAT IS HAVING TONS OF FUN! RICKY RAT, RICKY RAT!* reverberated off the walls of my skull and threatened to pop out through my red, blearing eyes. I just wanted to go home, I wanted to rest so badly… but I couldn’t. Couldn’t look at my phone, couldn’t call anyone, couldn’t do-

William tugged at my sleeve. “Give me coins for the arcade,” he said, wiping at his nose.

I checked my pockets and found that they were empty. “I’m sorry,” I said. “I don’t have any coins.”

“Then open your wallet and give me money to get some,” he replied, his voice flat.

I found my hand reaching for my wallet. I handed William a $20 bill and watched as he stared at it before shoving it into the coin machine. A flurry of shimmering tokens flew into William’s palm and his mouth wrinkled in delight.

“Thanks Rachel, you’re really making this party so much fun. I like you. You’re not as annoying as everyone else. You can rest your eyes for a little bit now, but only a little. You’re going to give me a piggyback ride later! But cheer me on! Tell me how great I am at whack-a-mole!”

William was a few minutes into the greatest game of whack-a-mole I had ever witnessed when Mr. Vinny, red-faced, grabbed William by the hand momentarily breaking the spell William had me under.

“I don’t know what the fuck you are, you little freak, but you are not in charge here. I am, and I am so fuckin’ sick of you entitled little motherfuck-“

Mr. Vinny stopped moving. Whatever hope had briefly sparked in my chest was now rapidly dying.

“I’ve whacked every mole in here, Mr. Vinny, and there’s barely any tickets coming out of the machine. Why is that? I bet if I dropped some skee-balls dead center, I also wouldn’t get many tickets.”

Mr. Vinny’s face was turning red as a tomato. Whatever he was doing to try to resist William’s influence wasn’t working. William looked over at the prize area where tchotchkes littered the walls and glass prize case: stuffed animals, packs of gum and other candy, plastic toy swords, small action figures, bouncy balls, rubber ninjas, rainbow-colored koosh balls, glow-in-the-dark pencils, toy cars, and various other cheap paraphernalia that glittered like gold to excited children.

“I don’t like these ticket prices. Did you set them yourself? Seems like your average kid could barely afford anything here.”

Mr. Vinny, sweat dripping, tried to shake his head. “Corporate… mandated these prices… I…”

William shook his head. “I know that you’re lying. You set these prices yourself! You don’t have a kind heart, Mr. Vinny. You’re not a real one. You know what? I think you should cut your heart out of your chest with that boxcutter over there.”

“Wait!” begged Mr. Vinny as his hand drifted to where the boxcutter sat on the counter behind him. “I’ll give you anything… you can have all the prizes! Anything!”

The kid frowned. “I don’t want to straight up cheat, Mr. Vinny. That’s no fun! I want what every kid wants, a fair shot!” And with that, William leaned back and beamed a skee-ball ball right dead center of the lane. Grinning, William turned to me. “Wasn’t that pretty cool, Rachel?” he asked me.

“It was so cool,” I grunted. “You’re… so amazing, William.”

The blade flared out of the boxcutter with a click. Mr. Vinny’s poor, ashen face grew whiter by the second. “I swear, I’m not a bad guy! Please! Pl-“

The box cutter shot across Mr. Vinny’s chest, the blade gleaming, tinged with blood. A fine line began to spread across Mr. Vinny’s chest, coloring his shirt red. He screamed and William made a motion with his hand that rendered Mr. Vinny silent. I watched in horror as Mr. Vinny went to work for the last time in his life.

Mr. Vinny, silently gasping, his mouth open to a scream that would not come, continued carving with the boxcutter, slicing through flesh and muscle. There was the sound of wet meat continually being carved and peeled away that made me sick to my stomach as blood spurted onto the glass case of the prize gallery, turning the stuffed animals red.

I felt tears roll down my cheek, but I couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak. Mr. Vinny’s hands were red now, slicked with blood that dripped from his palms onto his pants. His shirt was completely eviscerated and a darker line formed from where he was continually carving into his chest, sawing back and forth. Then I saw flashes of white and realized he was hitting something much deeper.

My sinuses filled with the sickening scent of musty copper.

It seemed like William was the only thing keeping Mr. Vinny standing as the manager grew paler and paler by the second. He must have hit an artery because blood now spurted out in thick, unfocused streaks that splattered all over the prize case, spilling on the prizes below.

“With my dying breath,” Mr. Vinny wheezed, “I bequeath all of Ricky’s Playhouse to William.” Mr. Vinny slumped over, and I knew that he was dead.

William clapped enthusiastically and started raiding the prize case, undeterred by all the blood.

The sound of the Ricky the Rat song filled my ears as tears continued to drip down my face. I couldn't stop shaking. My teeth chattered as my voice finally came back to me. “William, please. I want to go home, I want to go see my parents. See my dog. Please let us all go.”

“But Rachel,” William replied, his face contorting into a sadistic grin as he smashed the glass of the prize case. “This birthday party is just getting started! Why, I think this might turn into a birthday week, if not a birthday month! We're going to have so much fun together!"
