Remy and I were walking through the food court at the mall. She kept squealing at the sight of every new selfie on Instagram of her and her friends that happened to get more than 100 likes every 5 minutes. Thankfully, busy as it was, I could tune her out. I'd have probably lost my damn mind otherwise.

What I couldn't well ignore though was the fucker in a black hoodie over in the distance that I could tell was following me. At first, I thought, you know, maybe I'm overreacting because it's a big crowd, you know? Everyone's up and moving around, yakking each other's ears off, music's playing everywhere -- you know, "alive" -- and my anxiety was acting up. But then we get in line at the Chinese place and I look over to see the guy's *still* standing there, leaning up against the wall of the electronics store, *staring right at me!*

In most cases I'd have brushed this off, but like I said, anxiety was already through the damn roof at that point and on top of that, the guy's hood was pulled over his head to the point where I couldn't see anything of his face. Even still, yeah, I knew he was watching me. I don't know how, but I just *knew*.

I turned and nudged Remy, asking, "Hey, um... you see that guy over there, right?" She turned to me and then to the guy.

"Um, yeah, why?"

"I think he's been following us for the past thirty minutes." She raised her eyebrows, passing another back-and-forth glance between me and him. "He's been behind us at least since we left the J.C. Penny." She kept passing glances for about another minute before noticing that we were next in line. She stepped up to the counter and started giving the guy her order while I kept my eye on the hoodie guy.

Before I go any further, I will point out that, yes, I am fully aware of how paranoid this all sounds. Honestly, if it weren't for the fact that my little brother was still missing after having been abducted from the park at least two years ago, I probably wouldn't be as high strung about guys running around looking and acting the way he was. As it was, every second I continued looking at him, all I could think was that this guy either had a gun or a knife, hell, even a *bomb vest* or something under that hoodie. Something that he apparently intended to use on me for whatever reason.

I didn't even realize I was actually staring at him until Remy punched me in the shoulder saying, "Yo, Earth to Vince, what you want to eat?" I broke and looked her.

"Huh?"

"It's our turn, dork, you getting anything?"

"Oh, uh... Y-Yeah, um..." I rubbed my eyes and scanned their menu. "Yeah, I'll have an order of the "General Tso's Chicken" with extra rice, four egg rolls, and a large..." I trailed off again, glancing back to the electronics store. He wasn't there anymore.

"Sir?" The cashier's voice broke me again.

"Huh? Oh, uh, yeah, "General Tso's Chicken" -- Extra rice, four egg rolls, and a large Coke."

"Will that be all?" he asked, writing the order on a slip.

"That'll get it." Remy replied. "How much?"

"Your total bottoms out to $21.75. Will that be cash or card." Remy started digging around in her backpack while I was frantically scanning the area for the guy. He was just there not two seconds ago, I thought, how in the hell is he gone? *Where* could he have gone? Oddly, this had my heart racing even faster than earlier when he was right there. At least *then* I actually *knew* where he was. Kind of like when you see a spider and go to grab something to smash it, but turn back around and *poof,* it's gone and now you're scrambling to figure out where the little fucker's gonna turn up next.

This didn't last long, though, because a quick glance over to the escalators was all it took. There he was, obviously still staring at me, coming up the escalator. He made it all the way to the top and stepped off, then just stood there. I felt Remy tug on my shoulder again. "Yo, you got an extra dollar to spare?"

"Um, yeah, hold on." I started digging around my back pocket for my wallet, not taking my eyes off the guy. I pulled out a dollar (possibly a five, wasn't paying attention), when a group of girls passed in front of the guy heading for the restrooms. When they were gone, so was he again. *Wait, what the fu--*

"Hey, Dork, the order's out, come on." I turned to see Remy holding the bags of our food, so I went over and took one of the bags, passing one last glance to the escalator to see if he was actually gone. He was.

The two of us sat down and got into the food. Another odd thing about me is that when I get nervous, my appetite actually increases. I started devouring my General Tso's like a fuckin' animal, darting my eyes all around the room, looking for him. Remy stared at me with her eyebrows raised while fiddling to open her chopsticks. I could also see weird stares from everyone around me, but hell if I cared. I'd burned through the chicken and almost half the rice when I spotted him across from the food court, standing in front of the Spencer's.

I froze mid-chew, my cheeks still full of rice and my eyes doubled. *What in the hell is this? How is he all the way over there now?* I did a double take between the escalator and the Spencer's. I swallowed down what I had with a swig of Coke before getting up from the table. "Where are you going?" Remy asked.

"Um, just give me a sec, I'll be right back." I speed-walked over to the Spencer's, right up to the guy, and asked. "Hey man, do I know you?" He didn't say anything, just silently backed away from me into the store. "Wait, hey, I'm talking to you, where're you going?" He kept backing further and further away from me, still facing me as he went. He even bumped into a few people as he went along, which caused a few people to turn around and either say "Oh excuse me", or "Hey, watch it, bro!"

It made no difference to him though. He just kept backing further and further into the store until finally disappearing into a small group of punks gathered around at the back of the place, gawking at the rope bondages and ball gags, etc. I stood there for a good minute or so, throwing my head everywhere for about the millionth time trying to find this asshole. As the group started to migrate away from the cheap sex toys, I stopped a couple of them and asked them if any of them might've seen or noticed where the dude in the black hoodie went.

None of them replied outside of a few skeptical looks and bursts of chuckling. *figures...*

Of course, this just confused me more because, again, he was right there. *RIGHT FUCKING THERE! How* could they not have seen or noticed *anything*? Not to mention the other recurring question of just how in God's name he could just up and vanish like that. There's no door at the back of Spencer's, not that anyone who doesn't work there would have access to anyways. Where hell was he now?

I spent another minute and a half scouring the store like a lunatic before walking out and back to the food court. Remy was still at the table, eyeing me with a condescending smirk as she wiped her mouth. "So uh, you find what you were looking for?" she asked, snickering.

I sighed and absently replied, "No."

"Dude, what's going on? You're kind of starting to freak me out here." I looked around the area again before leaning in close to her.

"It's that guy in the hoodie." She frowned.

"What guy?"

"The one I showed you when we were in line." She glanced up and around.

"Where?"

"I... I don't know, he's... He's gone again."

"Again?"

"Yeah, first he was over by the electronics store, then the escalator, then I watched him walk into Spencer's. He just kept disappearing." For a moment, she just stared at me, utterly bewildered. "I'm serious, this guy's watching me."

She pinched the bridge of her nose before getting up. "Hey, where're you going?"

"I need the bathroom."

I stood up. "Hey, wait, you can't go alone." She scoffed.

"What, are you gonna follow me into the "Women's room"? And here you are telling *me* about a stalker." She chuckled. I remained serious. "Look, dude, I'll be fine, just wait for me here and, I don't know, we can hit up the arcade or something, I don't know."

With that, she walked off to the restrooms, leaving me standing alone in the food court. I stood, trembling violently. Everywhere around me, people were still up and mingling noisily. My eyes dared around the room hectically. *Where is he? Where did he go? How did  he disappear like that? Who even is he and why the hell is he stalking me? What am I--*

My thoughts abruptly died when I felt a hand on my shoulder. "You okay, man?" I turned to see this kid, about my height, probably just turned 21, staring worriedly at me. For a moment, the world seemed to both fly by me and slow down at the same time. I stood there, blinking rapidly at him for a solid minute and a half before shaking my head and replying, "Uh... Y-Yeah... Yeah, I-I..."

His eyebrow raised, eyes doubling in size. "You lost?" he asked. I shook my head. "You looking for someone?" I looked at him, and then back to the distance.

"S-Sorta."

"Need help? maybe you can have one of the security guards--"

"Maybe." I blurted, not even realizing it until about a minute after. He sort of shrank back. "Sorry, um... Yeah, you know, I might do that. You know where one would be nearby?" He pointed over to the novelty hat shop just around the corner of the food court. "Thanks."

I speed-walked over to the hat shop and sure enough, there was one of the security guards, standing alert at the right of the door. I was in the middle of figuring out what I was going to say to him when, almost in a fucked up sense of irony, Hoodie guy was also there, standing perfectly still in the hat shop, obviously staring dead at me. This caused me to freeze up.

*What the fuck, when did he get all the way here?!*

I did a quick double-take between the hat shop and Spencer's. Even as long as it'd been since I'd last seen him, there was still no way he could've made it all the way from there to the hat shop without me seeing him at least once. Not with the way I was watching the place. The security guard looked at me. "You okay, sir?"

I looked at him with one eye, keeping the other trained on the guy in the store. He seemed to pick up on this because he glanced inside at the guy and back to me. I nodded and he nodded before going into the store. I watched him walk up to the guy and ask him to remove the hood. He just stood there, unmoving, not taking his focus off of me.

"Hey, sir, you hear me, I'm gonna have to ask you to remove the hood." He still didn't move. The security guard radioed for backup before attempting to grab the guy's arm. This was when hoodie guy reacted by throwing the guards hand away and sprinting straight for me. My brain couldn't register the situation in time for me to do anything except throw my hands up in front of my face.

I expected him to tackle me or something, but he didn't. Instead, I brought my arms down to find that he was gone again. The security guard came running out of the shop and looked at me. "You see where he went?" I shook my head frantically.

"Great." he said, mashing the button on his radio. "Hey Ronson, Charles here, come in, over?"

**-- "Ronson here, talk to me Charlie."**

"Keep an eye out, there's a punk in a black hoodie running around harassing people, possible shoplifter, just bowled me over in the hat shop before taking off." I heard a laugh sound over the radio.

**-- "Bowled YOU over? Christ, he'd have to be one big son of a bitch."**

"Yeah, yeah, look, just keep an eye out will ya, over and out."

**-- "Copy, over and out."**

The officer turned to me and said\*\*,\*\* "Don't worry, we'll catch him. In the meantime, just watch yourself, 'kay?" I just stared blankly at him and he went back to his post at the right of the shop entrance. I was frozen once again. Now I was even more terrified.

Here's the thing, Ronson or whatever his name was, wasn't exactly kidding when he remarked about the guy having to be "One big S.O.B." to knock the security guard down. The guard himself was built just like you'd imagine a bouncer in a shady looking bar to look like, and yet hoodie guy just shrugged him off like he was nothing. Here's the catch: hoodie guy *wasn't* big. At all.

To paint a clear picture, the guy was about my height, 5'9" to about 6', and about as skinny as a rail. Without the hoodie, he'd probably look like the least threatening person there. Yet, *he tossed aside a fucking security guard that was THRICE his size!* If he could do *that*, then God only knew what he'd be able to do to me if he got his hands on me.

I finally turned and headed back to the food court. It was right before I crossed the threshold, however, that I found him yet again, right there at the table Remy and I were sitting at. Immediately, instincts kicked into overdrive to rush back to the security guard and tell him, but before I could take even one step backwards, hoodie guy was sprinting right for me again. This time, he *actually* grabbed me, seizing me tightly by the shoulders.

His hands were shaking violently. My heart had stopped and so all I could do was stand there, a stuck fucking pig, and stare directly into his hidden face. The guy's whole body was shaking. I could hear his breathing -- that is, if you could really call it "Breathing". It sounded like an overweight chain smoker trying to breathe. My jaw fell open, flopping, trying to speak.

"V-V-Vih," I heard him wheeze out.

"Wh-What?" I could feel myself starting to hyperventilate. I couldn't move, I couldn't fight, I couldn't think. I couldn't do *anything!*

"V-Vincent..." he croaked. My eyes widened. How the hell did he know my name? All around me, the lights began flickering. I noticed, too, that *my* body was vibrating right alongside his. It felt like my body was becoming unthreaded like an old blanket.

*What the hell's going o--*

"Vince!"

The voice was clear now. Not only that, but it was somehow... *familiar...*

"Vincent!" I swung my head around the room. The lights were flickering much more rapidly now. The people were all sort of shifting in this weird sort of way. You know how when you're trying to take someone's picture while they're moving and it comes out all blurry? Well, it was like that, but now imagine that they're all just moving in real time.

Not only this, but the entire food court, the entire *mall* in fact, was vibrating in a similar way. Weirder still, though, was the fact that *this* didn't seem to affect the people all that much. The flickering lights, on the other hand, had them all up and rushing to the escalators. I, however, was fixed in hoodie guy's grasp.

"Vince, I need you to listen to me!" he shouted. My eyes snapped back to him. I still couldn’t see his face. “We’re out of time! We have to go. I can’t sta—“ His voice cut out, fizzing into this static sort of fuzz while his neck jerked violently from side to side.

The lights flickering got more and more frantic. I should also mention that this entire time, my ears felt like they’d been stuffed with cotton and my breath felt heavy, making breathing more difficult than it should’ve been. His head straightened back up and he said, now in a voice that was noticeably smaller, younger perhaps, “I can’t stay much longer, Vince! The r-rif—“

He cut out again, his head seizing again, before snapping back up and saying, now in a voice I recognized all *too* well, “The rift is opening. Time will split apart and then—“ He cut off again. This time, his seizure was replaced with a loud, high pitched shriek, sounding like a little boy who’d stubbed his toe.

The way *HE* sounded.

“E-Eddie?” Before he or I could do anything else, I watched his body vibrate until it basically phased out of existence right in front of me. The world looked normal again — well, sort of. Everything was still again in the sense that the world wasn’t vibrating anymore. The lights were still flickering though and everyone around was in a panicked uproar.

Everyone was clustered at the escalators, shouting and screaming. I ran toward them to look for Remy. Trying to Wade through the crowd was damn near impossible to do, with everyone pushing and shoving around in every direction.

“Remy!” I cried. “Remy!” I couldn’t see her. I couldn’t see *anything*, only millions of shifting bodies. Even this started to become more and more of a challenge when the lights started to go more and more.

Eventually, the lights finally vanished, blanketing the entire mall in darkness. In turn, all absolute hell broke loose, with people battering me from each direction all at once, all screaming. I lasted *maybe* two minutes before I was knocked to the ground. From there, I was essentially a human "Welcome mat" for everyone around to trample my entire body into a fuckin' mudhole. Just imagine this for a second, being stomped on from all sides in the dark; you can't see shit-all around you and can't hear yourself think from all the screaming that's surrounding you, suffocating you, essentially, and then all of a sudden, you see a large, mysterious glow bathing the room around you, What would you do?

My answer, not a goddamn thing except lay there. Stupid as I'm sure that sounds to you, I know, but aside from how bad my body was aching from being trampled for at least three minutes straight, the sight of the glow instilled a certifiable sense of dread in me. Somehow, I couldn't explain it -- and I *still* can't really -- but something in me was telling me that being in that light was a bad idea. Like somehow my life would be in danger from it or something *in it* if I stood up. 

This instinct may well have saved my life, too, because the next thing I knew, People's shrieks of panic turned into bloodcurdling cries of terror. I heard the glass of the large windows next to the escalators shatter and people were all clamoring away frantically from the escalators. This, of course, meant I was stomped on again, but this time didn't last as long because most of those attempting to flee were almost instantly pulled back by something invisible. I craned my neck up ever so slightly to see what was happening and saw what looked like a giant, gaping purple maw right outside the windows, with people being whisked away into it, devoured by it, by fives or more. 

A few I saw were trying feebly to hold onto the rails of the escalators, but were soon taken like the rest. Before too much longer, I was being pulled in myself. I tried as hard as I possibly could to anchor my fingernails into the small crevices on the floor but that was quickly failing so I tried grabbing onto the rail of the escalator myself. I managed to lock both my arms and legs around it which managed, sure enough, to keep me stationary. Air came whipping across my face from the opposite direction of the windows, all of it, all at once, being ripped right into the swirling purple void along with everybody else. 

I held on for dear life, but soon, I realized this wasn't going to keep me safe for much longer because I could see the railing of the escalators starting to bend, pulling the post right out of the floor. I was out of options. Whether I let go now, or held on, I was gonna be pulled in. I closed my eyes and began to do something I hadn't done in at least three years; prayed.

*God, please, I'm begging you, PLEASE, send an angel or something, just please don't let me get pulled into this thing!* 

Cheesy as this is about to sound, this might've actually worked... In a way. I still don't really know. It gets extremely confusing here (as if it weren't enough already, right? Yeah, I get it, trust me). The post I was wrapped around was almost three quarters of the way off the ground by the time it happened, I heard a voice, somehow amplified through all the chaos. "Vince!" 

My eyes opened and looked around. Reaching through the void was hoodie guy, Eddie. His voice echoed, cycling through all three of the voices he'd used before all of this, while his body twitched at supersonic speeds. "Vince, you have to let go!"

My eyes grew. *Let go?!* I screamed to myself in disbelief. He wants me to "let go?" Was my brother *trying* to get me killed too?

"Vincent, it's me," he cried in the child voice. Then in the teenager voice, he said, "You have to let go of the railing! I'll catch you, but you have to let go!" I looked down at the post of the escalator railing. Three of the nails had already been popped loose. This thing was *literally* one screw loose away from sending me into oblivion. I looked back to the void to see Eddie forcing himself forward out into the mall floor. "Do it!"

"I... I can't!" I shouted. 

"You can do it!" he shouted back in the adult voice. 

"I'm screwed if I let go!" The sudden rush of air was now to a point where it was stinging my face. I looked at the post again. the last screw was already almost halfway out of its groove. The railing itself was starting to bend in the direction of the void. Eddie was all the way out now. "Vincent," he called out in the child's voice again, "You have to trust me, I'll catch you. Remember how you always promised to catch me on the monkey bars?" 

I looked back at him, my heart pounding dangerously quick with my mind in over 10,000 places at the same time. He started toward me, but stopped, seemingly unable to walk any further. "Vincent, you have to trust me, let go or you'll be taken with the rest!" 

He collapsed to his knees and began to seize violently. "Hurry!" I looked at him, then the void, then again to the railing. The screw was hardly hanging by a thread. The post was already leaning toward the window, further and further coming out of the floor. I began hyperventilating. 

I didn't know what to do. If I stayed, I was screwed, if I let go, I'd be screwed. I thought about how he said he'd catch me. How? He couldn't even stand up, how the hell was he going to catch me, and even if he actually could, what was going to keep the both of us from being pulled in?

I closed my eyes again, taking a deep breath. *Calm down, Vince, just breathe.* Slowly, more unconsciously than anything else, my fingers slowly unraveled from the escalator railing. I was afraid, terrified actually, but I thought of the times Eddie and I would play "Trust fall" in my bedroom. A few times, sure, I'd be the douchebag big brother and let him bust his ass on the floor (though I'd always pick him right back up and let him get one good swing at my shoulder), but for the most part, I'd catch him, telling him I had him, that I'd always have him. 

*Even when he disappeared...*

My fingers unraveled the rest of the way and I felt myself being pulled like a feather in the rushing wind. As I was carried along, my eyes stayed shut, imagining the time he'd gotten stuck on the monkey bars at the playground, crying that he was too afraid to come down. "Just jump, Ed, I promise, I've got you." He cried, claiming he couldn't do it, just like I did, and just like he did here with me, I promised him I'd always have him. He jumped and I caught him. The blow ended up taking us both to the ground and knocking the wind right out of me, but he was fine, perfectly safe. 

Now he'd have to do the same for me. He'd have to catch me, even if it might be at his own expense. I floated in a free-fall until I felt his arms grasp tight around me. His body was vibrating again, but somehow he was anchored to the floor. The air crashed against our two bodies with the force of at least 10 hurricanes rolled into one, yet he managed to stay put. "I've got you Vince!" I heard him shout in the teenager voice. In the adult voice, I heard him shout, "Just hold onto me, it's almost over!" With that, I wrapped my arms tight around him like I had the escalator railing. 

The air crashed against us for another full minute, each second causing the vibrations of Eddie's body to pick up speed, before finally ceasing abruptly. Everything was quiet then. Everything was calm. My eyes opened and I was still there, in the mall. I was safe. I looked around, Eddie was nowhere in sight. I called out for him. Nothing. 

I jumped to my feet and started running through the food court, looking all around the mall. "Eddie, Eddie, where are you? You there? Eddie?!" My heart was pounding again. I had to find him. There were so many questions I had, believe it or not, the least of which being whatever the fuck all of *that* was from just two seconds ago. For a moment, I heard nothing but silence. The place was deserted. 

None of the structural damage was visible, either. It looked like absolutely nothing had happened and just like it had before, save for the fact that there was only me now, nobody else. Nobody else, that is, except for Eddie. I heard his childlike voice call out to me from the electronics store, "I'm over here." 

"Eddie!" I cried, both in relief and joy, running over to him. I was two steps from being in distance to snatch him up in the biggest bear hug of his life when I stopped. He shot out his arm and began convulsing again before crying out in the adult voice, "Don't, just stay back."

"Eddie, you're alive! I.. I can't believe--"

"No, bro, I'm..." He cried out in pain before continuing in the teenager voice, "I'm not, not really."

"What are you talking about?"

In the kid voice, he replied, "I'm not really alive anymore, Vince. I'm not supposed to be here at all."

"I.. I don't... Eddie, talk to me, what's going on?" His body twitched spasmodically, so violently in fact that I had to back away from him to avoid being hit by his arms. His body continued vibrating faster and faster, causing his voice to actually fade to a static buzz whenever he tried to speak. 

"I'm not supposed to be here, in the real world. I don't have time to explain it, and I don't really think I could even if I *did.*" His voice changed to the teenager's again. "But what just happened has happened before. I don't know how many times exactly, but I was young when I first saw it..." His voice shifted to the kid's and he said, "8 years old."

My eyes widened. That was how old he was when he disappeared. He must've seen me connect the dots in my head because the next thing he said, in the adult voice, was, "Yes, now you know what happened to me all that time ago." In the teenager voice, he added, "It was so sudden. One second, I was looking at the toys, and the next, I'm being taken by the purple light, right along with at least two others."

A cry of pain caused his body to jerk itself into a painful contortion before reshaping itself. In the adult voice, he said, "God, it hurts so much now."

"What do we do? There's gotta be a way to help." He shook his head, and I could tell it wasn't just the spasms either, even if I was actually wanting them to be in this instance. "What do you mean?"

"There's no way to fix this, Vincent." he answered in the kid voice. 

"There's gotta be a way!" I ripped my phone from my pocket and was about to dial 911 when he told me to stop.

In the teenager voice, he said, "I can't stay any longer, big bro. The longer I do, the more likely that is to happen again." He pointed over to the windows. His voice changed to the adult and said, "I was lucky to escape, but I can't stay in one place for too long."

"But then, why were you here? If this thing follows you, why did you come?"

For the first -- and last time -- he pulled off his hood, revealing the face of my long-lost kid brother, wearing a warm, if only bittersweet smile, and in the kid voice, he said, "Because, Vince, I wanted you to know the truth and know that, just like you did with me, I've always got you." 

My heart dropped into my stomach, shattering on impact. Tears started burning my eyes. Two seconds after those words left his mouth, the vibrations of his body began phasing him in and out of existence. I threw myself at him and wrapped my arms around him.

"No, no Eddie, you can't go!" My arms tightened around him the more I felt him ebb away. "Eddie! Eddie, no please don't." My breath was panicked. The lump in my throat finally took effect and the dam broke, flooding my face with tears. "Eddie, no, don't go!"

As I felt the last bit of my brother fade into nonexistence once again, I muttered, "I've always got you, little bro." For a bit of time after that, I just sat there, on my knees, bawling my eyes out, repeating, "I've always got you. I've always got you."

I can't really say much about what happened afterwards. So much happened, and yet so little at the same time. The kicker with all of this, I'm slowly starting to forget what happened there that day, two days (3 maybe?) ago. I'm not sure, but I think that must be an effect of whatever the hell that thing was. That's why I'm recording this, to preserve the most detailed account of what happened. Oddly, I remember Remy because, through everything that happened, she survived. 

She was the one that found me on the floor of the mall, in fact. When she asked what was going on, I couldn't tell her. Not only because of the emotional state I was in, but just the sheer fact that I didn't understand much, if anything, of what happened. And as I've said at least 100 times now, I STILL DON'T. 

I don't think I ever will. Maybe its best that way, though, who knows. What I do know, though, is that Eddie's still out there, somewhere, everywhere, nowhere, all at the same time. I know this because at least twice since this happened, I've seen him crop up in various places, always watching over me. Every time he does, a little message is left behind, **"I Got U."** 

Sometimes, these little notes are noticed by others and speculated about, calling them an "Extraordinary phenomena." Only I know what it *really* is and what it *really* means. I've tried to make it a point to remember each and every time I'd be lucky enough to spot him. That's why I write this now, so I make sure I can keep my promise to him. I've got him, by making sure he'll never be forgotten.
