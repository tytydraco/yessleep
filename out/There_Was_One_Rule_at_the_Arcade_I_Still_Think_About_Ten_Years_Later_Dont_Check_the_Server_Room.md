I worked the night shift at a small arcade in my early twenties.

My shift started at 6 P.M. and ended at 1 A.M. The place was usually crowded, and we served beer alongside the games. It wasn’t just an arcade—it was somewhere people drank, played, and stayed longer than they should have.

I took the job because it paid better than average. I only worked there for six months before I had to leave for mandatory military service in my country. At the time, I didn’t think much about what happened during my last weeks there. By the time my service ended two years later, the memory had faded.

It wasn’t until this winter that it came back to me.

And I realized how glad I was that I never broke the rule.

The arcade officially closed at 1 A.M., but the owner usually left around 11. After that, the entire place was mine. Most nights were quiet. People left early. No one came in that late.

That night was different.

At 12:30 A.M., three drunk men walked in.

It wasn’t common, but it happened. They were well-dressed, expensive coats, expensive watches, already slurring their words.

“Room for three,” one of them said.

I smiled and led them to the largest room. Not because they asked—because I didn’t want trouble.

They laughed loudly as I signed them in. I remember clearly: three people.

I checked the system to make sure the game had started. That mattered. We were paid per person, not per room.

I remember thinking, *Great. I’m getting off late.*

I messaged a friend to let them know, brewed myself a cup of coffee, and finished cleaning. By the time I closed the gate, the music was playing, and the place felt empty again.

That’s when I went outside for a smoke.

I had been gone for less than a minute.

I could still hear the game through the walls when I stepped outside. The music didn’t stop. No doors opened. No one passed me.

When I came back inside, nothing felt different.

Except there were only two of them standing at the counter.

One of the men looked at me and asked,

“Have you seen our other friend?”

I paused.

There were supposed to be three of them.

Then one of the others started calling his phone.

We all heard it ringing.

From inside one of the empty rooms.

 

I found his phone in the room. It was on the couch, still vibrating.  
His tie was on the floor.

Other than that, the room was clean.

I handed both to one of them. At the time, I wasn’t scared. I was annoyed. I already knew I’d be getting off work much later than planned.

They didn’t look annoyed.

One of them was on the phone, speaking quietly. When he hung up, he asked if I could talk to her.

I took the phone.

She sounded desperate.

“Are you really the manager?” she asked. “This isn’t a joke, right?”

I told her I worked there.

She explained that her husband—fiancé, I wasn’t sure—had a habit of falling asleep anywhere when he was drunk. She asked me to look for him, just to make sure he was okay.

It was winter. Letting someone pass out somewhere cold wasn’t a good idea.

I told her I would check.

By then, it was almost 2 A.M. I had already cleaned the place and locked the front door. The only exit still open was the back door, which led to the elevators.

Anyone leaving that way would have been caught on camera.

The problem was, I didn’t know the access code.

I hesitated, then called the owner.

He picked up immediately.

He sounded irritated, like I’d woken him up, but after I explained the situation, he gave me the code.

Before hanging up, he said one thing very clearly.

“You can check the cameras,” he said. “But do not go into the server room.”

I didn’t argue. I was too tired to care about the server room.

I pulled up the footage.

On the screen, I saw myself playing on my phone before stepping into the smoking room. Less than a minute later, the door to the arcade opened.

The missing man stepped out.

He walked straight toward the camera—then turned away at the last second, moving out of view.

Like he knew exactly where the blind spot was.

Less than a minute later, the other two left their room and came to the counter.

That was it.

No footage of him leaving the building.

I called the building’s night guard. He was still on duty and swore he hadn’t seen anyone leave. He said he’d been sitting by the elevators the whole time, watching a game on his phone.

I had to close the arcade. Even if someone was missing, I still had to finish the register and lock the place.

I took one of their phone numbers and told them I’d call if I found their friend. They nodded and left.

After they were gone, the arcade went completely quiet.

The only sound I could hear came from behind the walls.

From the direction of the server room.

The night guard came down a few minutes later and asked if I could help him check the rest of the building. It was a ten-story building, and checking it alone would take too long.

We locked both the front and back doors and started from the top floor, working our way down, checking stairwells and hallways in case the guy had passed out somewhere.

While we walked, I told him about the phone and the tie I’d found.

He chuckled, like it wasn’t a big deal.

“You said you watched the footage,” he said. “Then how come you never saw him go into another room?”

“I was outside smoking,” I said. “They were already staying past closing.”

He smiled.

“Maybe he was trying to send a signal,” he said. “You sure they were getting along?”

That made me pause.

This was just an arcade. Why would anything else be going on?

I laughed it off.

“Nice try,” I said. “I even spoke to his girlfriend.”

He stopped walking for a second, then smiled again.

“How do you know she was his girlfriend?” he asked. “What if they wanted you to call her? Just to create an alibi?”

By the time he said that, we had reached the ground floor.

We still hadn’t found him.

“That’s it,” I said. “I’m calling it.”

The guard nodded.

“Did you know,” he said casually, “that before the arcade moved in, there was another floor below this one?”

I looked at him.

“There’s a hidden floor,” he continued. “You can access it through the server room.”

I was exhausted. It was almost 2:30 A.M.

“Forget it,” I said. “You’re just trying to scare me.”

He laughed.

“Want to check the server room?” I asked.

He shook his head.

“Trust me,” he said. “He’s not down there.”

He turned off the hallway lights.

The floor went dark, except for the red glow of the elevator numbers and a faint flickering light leaking out from under the server room door.

Before I could say anything, the elevator dinged.

The doors opened.

The guard smiled.

“Let’s go,” he said. “If he were in the server room, the morning shift would find him.”

“The morning shift?” I asked.

“Yeah,” he said. “They’re professionals.”

I didn’t touch the server room door.

I stepped into the elevator instead.

A few days later, I quit the job.

No one ever called me back about the missing man.

But even now, ten years later, I still remember the light coming from the server room.

No one was supposed to be in there.

So I still wonder—

why was it on?
