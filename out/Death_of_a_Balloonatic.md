My great grandfather was an incredible man. I don’t remember everything about him, but I can still feel the joy he would bring into any room he was in. His speech was slow and gruff with age, but it held the charm of a man whose spirit could never truly grow old. Even nearing a century, the way he’d laugh at his own jokes is permanently etched into my memory. The way he’d beam when bringing out Christmas and birthday presents, or even just home cooked meals gave a slight glimpse into the pure happiness he felt providing for others. But these are not the first things I think of when Pawpaw comes to mind.

He was a World War I veteran, though you would never be able to tell by meeting him. He didn’t fit my childhood understanding of someone who’d seen war. He never brought up any stories, or acted any different from the other old people I knew. He never showed any signs of PTSD that I recall, and I only knew he served from my Mom telling what little she knew. I know I asked about it a few times, but I would either get scolded by my parents, or he would chuckle and say something like “I’m so old I can barely remember.” However, the last time I would ask would be when he finally obliged.

My parents ran a company together, which would occasionally take them out of town. This would almost always leave me staying with him for a week or two. From the beginning of this visit, Papaw seemed different. My parents dropped me off late in the evening. The quiet suburban street always frightened me in the dark, so I waved my parents off and rushed to the door. When I rang the bell, he didn’t answer. He never locked his door, so I let myself in. The light of dusk creeped through the dim house, and I heard gunfire playing from the TV in the den. I dropped my suitcase in the living room and wandered through the dark towards the source. 

When I turned the corner, I saw he was watching an old war movie. As long as I knew him, he never watched movies. He was the type to play sitcoms on repeat, almost exclusively. I have more Beverly Hillbillies references than any other person my age, and I always loved when he put them on. It also didn’t look like he was really watching either. Though I could only see the top of his wrinkled head, it was pointed at the corner of the room. I guessed he was sleeping and crept closer to wake him gently, but he jumped and turned at me, startling me in return.

“Jesus Christ, Danny! When did you get here?”

“Sorry, Papaw, I thought you were sleeping.”

“No, buddy I just…I was just lost in thought.”

He reached for the remote and paused the movie right when a tank was blown to pieces.

“Whatcha watching?”

He looked back at the television and rubbed his head.

“Ah, just an old movie. Probably not something for a twelve year old, we can change it.”

“No, it’s okay!” I enthusiastically sat at the other end of the couch. “Mom says I can watch violent movies as long as there’s no swearing!”

He paused and squinted at the screen. He thought for a moment before deciding.

“Sure.”

He pressed play and the movie continued. Even through the black and white, I remember the scenes being pretty gruesome. Men getting shot, stabbed, flying away from explosions, all while screaming in a hectic chorus. It only took me a few minutes to connect the horror I was watching to my great grandfather’s history. I glanced towards him, and saw he was staring into the corner again, his eyes focusing on absence and his smile gone. I felt a swell of childhood fear, that uncomfortable sensation of your guardian not being in control.

“Grandpa?”

He let out a sigh, alien to any noise I knew him to make.

“Yeah, Danny.”

His dismissive tone made me look down sheepishly.

“Is this like what you did?”

I saw him shift his gaze to me out of the corner of my eye, then back to the wall.

“No Danny. This isn’t what I did.”

“Did you shoot people?”

“Not directly.”

I tilted my head towards him slightly. I had never heard any information about his service at all, and I was worried if I moved too quickly, he would stop.

“What does that mean?”

“I manned an observation balloon.”

“What’s that?”

Another complete exhalation of a sigh.

“You know what a hot air balloon is, right buddy?”

“Yeah.”

“Well, I would go up in one of those, and radio my friends to tell them where they needed to shoot, or warn them if bad guys were coming to get them.”

“How high up would you go?”

“Pretty high. I could see everything around us for miles.”

“How did you steer it?”

“I couldn’t steer it, buddy. The balloon was tied to a really long rope. I would just control whether it went up or down.”

“How did you dodge guns if you couldn’t steer?”

Papaw made a face at this. One I hadn’t ever seen him make before, and one that sent a chill down my tiny spine. Fear. His eyes grew behind the wrinkles that sunk his brow.

“You couldn’t. You just had to hope they didn’t get you.”

He seemed to realize the face he was making and resumed stoically watching the paint dry. 

“But we all had parachutes to get us to the ground safe if they did.”

“Did yours get shot down?” I asked, too much excitement in my voice.

A small scowl flashed across his lips for a moment.

“Yes Danny. My balloon got shot down.”

“Woah. What happened?”

“Danny, it’s really not a story to tell a child. It’s not something that’s easy to talk about.”

Youth offers many things, but it doesn’t always include empathy, and I really wanted to hear that story.

“Please, Papaw, pleeease? I won’t tell anyone, I swear! Pleeease tell me what happened?”

He removed his thin reading glasses and rubbed his eyes with his hand. He looked through his fingers back to the corner, and finally to me.

“Okay, Danny, Okay. Firstly, what do you know about the Great War?”

“Um, I don’t know. We fought Germany I think?”

“Amongst others, but yes, the Germans. It wasn’t like the other wars man waged against himself. Land wasn’t gained, cities weren’t taken. The front lines were like waves. We’d move forward and back, then forward, then back, and I saw all of it from the sky. Both sides had observation balloons, and both sides had planes that did everything they could to shoot them down. If you could get the planes through the enemy’s anti-air, popping them was nothing. We got our name from how dangerous the job was.”

“What was the name?” I had thrown all subtlety to the wind, and was staring wide eyed at the old man.

“Balloonatics. The Germans got to be called ‘Dragons’, but a better name didn’t make it any less dangerous for them.”

“Cool.”

“We had a radio set up in every balloon, so we would be able to relay what we saw to those on the ground. Bombardments, where troops were deployed, and when, I dictated an entire section by myself, all while listening for the sound of any planes that may be circling by.”

“What were you saying on the radio?”

“A mix of things buddy, I don’t fully remember.”

I nodded in disappointed understanding.

“Well, at some point in the day, a dark fog began to form on the ground. Not so dark that I would need to descend, but enough where the ground ebbed and flowed between visible and obstructed. I decided that the delay of my inputs would be worth the camouflage the weather provided me. It may have been cowardice, but I thought it right at the time.”

I felt my face begin to sink. For me, the story had stopped being a reminiscing about Papaw’s adventures, instead morphed into an honest retelling of how he digested combat.

“I was about to alert command about the weather, when the ground below me was hit. A massive artillery strike blasted my balloon free from its tether, and I began drifting in the wind, towards the enemy.”

“Oh my God!”

He raised a stern eyebrow at me.

“...gosh.” I corrected myself.

“I realized that if I descended, I would have landed on top of no man’s land, and the parachutes weren’t like they are today, I thought it likely the wind would still put me in the same spot. That was the deadliest place to find yourself Danny, and your Memaw, God rest her, was waiting for me to come home. I was trapped hundreds of feet in the air, and it was in that terror that I felt something.”

I didn’t dare interrupt him now. I had completely forgotten myself in his story.

“A tug, Danny. I felt something pulling on the rope tied to my balloon.”

My eyes narrowed in confusion.

“I carefully looked over, towards the end of the line. It was obscured in fog and I was so high up, but I could distinctly see something wrapped around the rope. At first I was thankful. I thought it had gotten snagged on a piece of wreckage, and that it might affix me to the ground for a safe descent. But after a moment, I heard it. A screeching cry of metal scraping across stone, like the Earth itself was shrieking in pain.”

His eyes were locked on the wall, breaths growing shorter. His body was stiff and leaning back, as if trying to escape his own story. If I was the adult writing this when he was telling it, I would have stopped him. I can’t imagine the terror seizing his body as he spoke, but I was young, his fear was contagious, and it left me paralyzed on the couch.

“Then, through the fog, I saw it. An amalgamation of smoke and bone. Flowing up the cord, but also scaling it. The closer it climbed, the more I could see. Its formless hide shifted in the wind, becoming that of a deer, then a cannon, then a man, then a bear. Halfway up the cable, I could see it was climbing with claws that glinted against the clouded sun. It coiled around the rope as if weightless, but would pull itself closer, and I would feel my vessel buckle under its heaving. It was dragging me closer just as it was dragging itself upwards. The final piece of its form that became known to me was a skull. The skull of a human. I realized this just as it sank its rusted claws into the wicker holding me within the sky. Then it screamed, Danny. It’s jaw unhinged, and I heard the dying wails of my brothers as they fell under turret fire, the howls of the enemy being blown apart by artillery, the terrified cry of horses swallowed in mud. Man, woman, and child, dozens of languages thundering from the demon’s maw. It was in that perfect nightmare, that I leapt from my balloon, strapped my parachute on, and descended to the ground. As soon as I did, my balloon erupted in turret fire. A German fighter blew it to pieces mere moments after I jumped. I couldn’t hear its approach over the roar of that thing, and had I not let my body take over, I wouldn’t have made it to the ground alive. I landed directly in the allied trench, and they brought me back to command for a report. A report I couldn’t find a voice to give to them.”

He finally broke from his trance of recollection. He looked at me, and realized I had been crying. I choked and wheezed. The story had indeed been too much for a child, just as it was too much for an old man.

“Oh Danny… Danny, I’m so sorry.”

He moved across the couch as quickly as his bones would allow, and hugged me tight. He brushed my hair and patted my back with his ancient hands. I could tell he was crying as well, not from his own memory, but because he had allowed it to slip out in front of me.

“I’m so sorry, Danny. I haven’t thought about that in so long, I… it’s like a waterfall when it… I’m so sorry.”

After a minute or two, I swallowed the rest of my tears, and sniffled as I wiped my wrist across my nose.

“I’m sorry, Papaw.”

“No, no you’re okay, buddy. You’re okay. Do you want some ice cream? We can watch some Beverly Hillbillies before bed time.”

“No it’s okay. I think I want to go to bed.”

He paused in hesitation, his lips curled inward.

“Okay, buddy, bed time it is. But if you need anything, you come get Papaw, okay?”

I nodded and headed to retrieve my suitcase. I grabbed my toothbrush and stared into the mirror for a while, his words replaying over and over again through my head. I didn’t want to bother him, no matter how scared I was. Even then, I knew I had messed up making him remember. So I finished brushing my teeth, and headed to bed, taking me past the den. The television was still on, but he hadn’t started watching anything else. He was staring in the corner again. But after watching him tell his story, the look in his eyes no longer seemed without focus. It was a quiet, muted version of when he described the creature on the rope. Moreso, his gaze had always met the same spot. When I entered, when he spoke, when I interrupted, and when he sat in silence, he was watching the same place on the wall, unseen fear squeezing its way through his tired body.  


I awoke the next day to find him still in that chair, but his eyes had changed. They weren’t scared anymore. They weren’t anything. Life had left him after I went to bed. I was terrified, doing the only thing little kids know to do in that situation. When the ambulance arrived, a very nice paramedic kept me company as they escorted his body away. My parents picked me up a few hours afterwards. They had flown back as soon as they were told what had happened. Mom put on a strong face, but I know now she could barely hold it together. Papaw pretty much raised her when her Dad died. They were inseparable. I wish she had gotten to hear his story instead of me. Not to avoid the nightmares it’s left me with, but because she would have been able to comfort him in his final moments. At least offering more than a scared twelve year old could.

Therapy wasn’t really a thing for kids back then, so my parents were just weird around me for a while. Overly positive, checking in one too many times to see how I was doing. They tried to keep the information around his death hidden from me, but I knew the truth that they couldn’t. Even after all the therapy I’ve gone through now, I wouldn’t be able to tell them what Papaw told me. They said the doctors claimed he died peacefully in his sleep at around 9:30, right after I would have been in bed. But I know it wasn’t peaceful. I know the war claimed another soul that night. One that had escaped its grasp in the sky and managed to live a life filled with kindness and love with the time he had stolen.
