This may of been for my own memory because I am just finding out about this. I have to look atound more and tries a game that called it scavenging and used to have to look in stuff anyway for people. Scavenging has been rough woke up hit before somewhere differnt hard to remember. Last year 2023 making it through Kincaid park I may of found a aounded agent sticker or something and tried to keep it(actually loseable just have a picture now). Depicted a faceless Checkered man with a Black/White jumpsuit and chess like pattern. He had a very large hole in him and the sign eeirly near another sign covered in stickers undecernable kinda nosy. i learned even though they had names I regretted talking about them so Ill call him Nick. 

I found out I had been seeing the word right it was a form of chess captcha from the goverment english people were not aupposed to meddle with if you still recieve the normal internet captcha. Meant to divert time light energy money social cues, and growth, some risk it is a real alien that learned to live with us even though they came from a shader doing alot of negative time to people to live still.

 They captcha game to people who are normal enough is unrefined and needed further investigation it was merely hidden in a higher company lebel who are unaware you see these chess boxes and but think stuff for a diffrent god then we were from. 


(Anyways Guess now its supposed to be about sticker blindness) 

After investigating finding too many rolls of foil agaisnt peoplea compasses apparently a horde of companys did attract the wrong company and tried to ban it or something. 

Standing around waiting I notied a Black Man mean Mugging me from a school bus but it was almost a diffrent person after a second. Kinda scary, Trying to shake it off with my bag I noticed his open window and windshield were completly covered in Stickers[100s] with no good angle to see forward and drive. Same thing somehow for the next 2 busses so I wuait looking for the label or a design only could see a whiteboard back.

They man was there again until he opened his mouth I saw him slip into a smaller sticker dude. I wonder now if kids do thia slip into eachothers words using stickers or something. Or if they ever notice stickers maybe not maybe have to grow up first. I got to leave on the public bus but found out Im kinsa nosy for drivers now who look super covered in stickers and foil, 

but before I even knew what I was doing I could hear a chat log or something really loud like yelling almost a mile away, from the bus stickers and found out that this topic got way too graphic for schools, no child was safe from the angry chat driver who loaded aware. If they spy like the cartoons.  

The chatlog demanded to know who told on him and held the bus hostage for 15-30 minutes of sticker time.  He wanted to look threw bags for screens or radios about sticker stuff. The chat made it sound like it got extremly threatening still when nothing was found on the bus no one knew about it. I NEVER KNEW HE DID ALL THE MONEY FROM OVER THERE WHERE HES ANGRY AND BLACK.


The kids have never been threatened so much before, the gang like chat user knew something about horror logs and attempted to load a real one voilent with a nosy products daughter being gang raped for real and mauled by a dog who ate her arm demanding to know who told on him. The school was violated forever and should of been condemed but its a future that loads people chat so there was a diffrent class bus for the next day.

He threatened me even more with a teacher dying raped again trying to save kids but hes a gang of himself in there and did even more horrifying pedophila stuff and sicking the dog on a laugher. I regret not knowing where those ones go in muldoon sounded like a differnt school then bartlett. They all expected me to go save them until I got to spy my way by not going there instead send a girl and see if shes touched alot from behind a label first anyway. And you know what shes not even that safe looking.

 Girls get raped on the backside of labels so bad I found out he only sends them messages on the front half of the screen, backend girls are braindead copying someone or something backlogging children should of been illiegal. When asked what Id bring to school to feel safe it was another gang with guns who wanted drugs or booze and maybe girls. No way id go into the sticker zoned school again without it.  Chatbot sticker said there was a rumored hidden rooms or hidden vision in people who dont do stuff normal anymore, and on the bus hidden seat behind driver where they touch people.

P.S. when asked who do I call about this I found out the American Military is super fucking aimbot hazed already that they could all be broke or repurposed before. They were not any safer in the sticker blind girls had to fuck and be okay with it to save all the boys from ignoring them or raping them. Evn worse the company repurposed all the guns and csrs for game stickers that sucked before, self shooting from lying about line of sight somehow. Same thing for mortor team. Jet pilots cockpit almost burned up forever when they hid stickers with fuel somehow too many no angle to see out of jet, very possible stuck in friendly fire aimbot hack for checks they called a derby when you trust them about living quarters and they change your aide to see if they get money. The point being never tell military or police about corrupt stickers. 

Chat did talk about a mission impossible guy on base who made face tape pretty real. Mayne drug tape was a real threat to industrys as well. Another dudes office in the precinct was visible was boarded up at the top of the building. He was aware too of some sort of thing but hes zone is too crowded by bars and dispensarys and a gang.

Last thing is agent phone said Marijuana and Weed were a diffrent strain of drug for men/men dogs only. Thats what men hear woman have always heard "Meph"
