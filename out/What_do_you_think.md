The Last Cigarette

Holding a pack of cigarettes in his hands, Gregor realized there were only two left. Lighting one, he sat on his balcony, listening to the rain pouring over his garden. As he flicked the smoldering butt away, a thought crossed his mind: I’ll smoke the last one and quit. Enough of being a puppet to this nonsense.

At that very moment, a voice came from the garden.

"Are you just throwing words around, or will you actually quit?"

Gregor froze, his eyes scanning the wet darkness below.

"Don’t bother looking for me," the voice continued. "I’m not out there. I’m in your head."

A chill ran down Gregor’s spine. I’m losing my mind, he thought.

"No," the voice replied, calm and steady. "You are perfectly sane. Now, sit back and do what you intended to do, Mr. Gregor."

Sweat beaded on his forehead, and his throat felt dry despite the rain-soaked air. He stepped back inside, locking the balcony door. His gaze fell on the pack—one cigarette left, its filter barely peeking out.

He rushed to the bathroom, splashing cold water on his face. Looking up, he met his reflection in the mirror—his usual, tired face staring back. What the hell was that? He waited, but the voice was gone.

By evening, after sleeping off the unsettling experience, Gregor stepped onto the balcony again. The rain had stopped, leaving behind only damp earth and puddles. He reached for the last cigarette, already forgetting his earlier fear.

Taking a long drag, he tapped the ash off the tip. As he raised it for another inhale, the voice returned.

"So... are you savoring your last cigarette? Or have you simply decided to follow through?"

The cigarette slipped from his fingers. Gregor bolted upright, shouting, "Who are you? Where the hell are you?"

"I told you," the voice sighed. "I’ve been in your head since the moment you decided to quit."

His eyes darted around frantically, searching for the unseen presence. Nothing.

He collapsed back into his chair, exhaling sharply. "So what now? Will you haunt me every time I light up?"

"You won’t light up again," the voice replied. "Because that was your last cigarette. Or rather… it slipped from your fingers and got soaked."

Gregor clenched his jaw. "And what if I buy another pack?"

Silence.

Then, a whisper:

"I will kill you."

His heart pounded. Cold sweat dripped down his back. This is insane. This isn’t real.

Gregor turned to step inside—but froze.

In the reflection of the balcony door, he saw himself. Or at least, he thought he did.

Then his reflection smiled.

Gregor's own face remained frozen in horror, but the one in the glass grinned wider, eyes glinting with eerie amusement.

The reflection lifted a hand and formed a gun with its fingers.

Gregor felt his own hand rise, mirroring the motion against his will. His muscles tensed, resisting—but it was useless. His hand moved as if it no longer belonged to him.

The reflection pulled the imaginary trigger.

Gregor's index finger twitched, mimicking the shot.

Then, once more, the voice whispered:

"I will kill you."

Laughter and chatter filled the dinner table. Gregor sat among friends, his wife, his kids, and his parents.

"So, Gregor," his childhood friend asked, "how the hell did you manage to quit smoking? You were a two-pack-a-day guy!"

Gregor smiled, lifting his glass.

"I just smoked my last cigarette," he said.
