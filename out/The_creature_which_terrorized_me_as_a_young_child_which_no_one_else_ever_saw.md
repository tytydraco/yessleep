This is a firsthand account of what I believe to be a demon.

When I was born, and my grandmother held me for the first time, the only words she could say were “He is protected.” She was a deeply religious person, and wouldn’t have said that if she didn’t truly believe it. 

Let me start this by giving you a mental image of the house I was raised in until I was 9, which is where most of this story takes place.

The main door was nearly the center of the wall facing the street. Looking out of the door to the street, the kitchen and garage were to the left and a hallway to the right. The door opened to a living room which had a view of a small pond in our backyard, shared with our neighbors and another neighborhood across the pond from us. Down the hallway to the right of the main entrance was 4 doors, the first one was to an office on the left, and directly across from it was my parent’s master bedroom. Next to the office was my bedroom. At the end of the hallway was my bathroom. The master bathroom took up the same length as my bedroom, so the hallway was perfectly straight. Between the main entrance and kitchen was a small wooden bench, which is hardly big enough to seat 2 grown adults, and is very low to the ground with 4 legs and some cross-beams to support weight. 

Now that I hope you have a mental image of my house, this should all be somewhat easier to understand. Until I was 6 years old, my parents had switched the lock on my bedroom door to lock from the hall as opposed to from within my room to ensure I wouldn’t escape my bedroom in the night and fall into the pond, frequently seen in which were copperheads, cottonmouths, aligator snapping turtles, and various other dangerous animals. Me getting up in the middle of the night was a very real concern, and to this day I still rarely sleep throughout a full night. As a young kid I would get really anxious when my parents would put me to bed and lock my door before I fell asleep, so they would leave my door open before I would fall asleep and come shut and lock it sometime well after I was dreaming. They never really knew why I was so anxious to fall asleep because it was something I didn’t, and still feel as though I don’t, have the words to effectively describe what I was seeing. The album cover for Bring Me The Horizon’s album Music to dance to ~ blaze to ~ pray to…, never sat right with me, but the reason why never connected until my parents had moved out of the house we moved into after I turned 10. Me and my mother were on the porch of a house they bought just 2 months ago at the time of this being written, when she asked me about the thing I saw between the ages of 2 and 6.

I would now like to reiterate that this is a first-hand account of what I truly believe to be an encounter with a demon. This can definitely be cast aside as some dream as a kid, but my parents both remember me crying about this before I was asleep, so it definitely isn’t a dream. 

The album cover shows something of a humanoid creature with large oval eyes, a pale face, jet black skin, a point at the top of its head, and no other discernible features aside from a circular pattern on its forehead. When asked about what the thing was that terrified me as a kid, my mind immediately flicked to this album cover. It is very similar to what I saw, though with some different features. The eyes were much smaller heightwise, but longer. The jet black skin was either a dark blue or purple. There was no circular pattern on it’s forehead. In the mouth area were 2 mandibles, though my young brain thought they were toothbrushes. These mandibles moved on their own, and would constantly hit each other making a very disturbing clicking noise, almost akin to what I now recognize as a geiger counter. The demon was very tall, it had to stoop down to look into my room, which had a door that was noticeably taller than my 6 foot tall father. My estimate is roughly 7.5-8.5 feet tall. The creature wore no clothing, though had no physical features on the rest of it’s body below the pale face. It still gave off a feminine air to it, my younger self deeply associated it with my mother, though it definitely was not her. It also had an extremely malicious and demonic aura, my younger self thought it wanted to steal me from my parents, and possibly eat me. 

It would show up at my door many nights when my parents would leave to go brush their teeth, which is where I think the toothbrushes thought for the mandibles stems from. The creature would never enter my room, just peer in through my door from near the office next to it. The creature triggered an immediate fight or flight response, though I was so stricken with fear all I could do is cry for help and hope my parents could hear me. When my parents would head my way, the creature would slink down the hallway before they would get to my bedroom to comfort me. This went on for 4 years, it was almost a nightly routine for us. Then my parents flipped the lock around so I could unlock the door from my side at the age of 6, when I was excelling in my swim lessons and my parents were less afraid of me falling into the pond. As I got older, I got braver.

Soon after my parents switched my lock around, I insisted I was okay, and they no longer needed to leave my door open until I was asleep. But deep down, I was still terrified of the creature that would visit me every night. Then I decided I was going to capture it to show my parents what had been terrifying me for the past 4 years. I waited for it to look into my room, where I waited just next to the wall it would peer around. I jumped out at it and started chasing it. This was the first time I had seen any legs on this creature. They took up a disproportionately large amount of it’s height, yet were very thin. Like the creature’s face, it’s legs were pale. The creature ran down the hall with me chasing it in what felt like slow motion. We passed my parent’s room and the office, which my parents didn’t notice. We continued our chase past the main entrance, and headed towards the kitchen. I assumed the creature would attempt to flee out of the garage, but I was sorely mistaken. It dived impossibly into the bench between the entrance and kitchen, dead center of the supports between the legs. During this dive it shrunk into microscopic size, and all that was left was a small cloud of smoke. I looked under the bench for any sign of the creature. After all, I had intended to capture it to prove to my parents that I wasn’t making this up, and couldn’t bear the thought of turning up empty handed. After finding nothing, I just sat in front of the bench and cried, not a loud cry but a silent one. My mother saw me crying, kneeled in the hall, and asked what happened and I explained it all. 

When we moved houses when I was 10, against my complaints, my parents brought the bench with them. It resided in my parents room, where it still is today. I absolutely refused to touch it, much less sit on it or move it. Not once did I see the creature again after chasing it to the bench, but every time I see the bench a small voice in the back of my head tells me to look for the creature on it’s legs. 

At the age of 19 now, I still vividly recall this creature, yet still don’t have the right words to describe it. My genuine thought is that it was a demon coming to possess or consume me. I think the reason it didn’t is because, like my grandmother said, I was protected by someone or something. I have told my story to a few friends, most of whom just laughed about it. Who would believe this after all, it just sounds like a bad dream right? I don’t think it is, and my parents both knew there was no way I was dreaming at the times I would cry for them to chase away the demon looking at me.

If anyone else has had an encounter with a similar creature, please let me know your experience, I would greatly appreciate other accounts to maybe make a definite decision on who or what this demon was.
