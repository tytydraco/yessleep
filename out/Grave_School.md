Professor Echidna (the Viper we called her) had the worst breath of all our professors, likely from the rotten child meat she ate for lunch. None of us had seen this act. Mere rumors. A booming voice came from her teeth littered orifice, sitting awkwardly upon her slithery form. Scales rustled under the latticework of black cloth over her otherwise pale chest. Rustling every time she spoke. Her pallid blue eyes pierced my narrow frame. She sat at the front of the class, fingers (blood-red nails) laced explicitly. Her lumpy tail thudded curiously. I was one of the last presentations. Go figure. This was her handiwork. I was easy pickings.

“Is that all, Frankie? Hm?” Spoken in a tone so pompous, so condescending and uptight. I studied her mouth, her gaudy voluptuous lips stained with too much lipstick, staining sections of the skin around, seeping onto her teeth. I imagined stapling them shut. She raised her bushy, black eyebrows, probing.

I wiggled my remaining toes, covering my stitch-spattered hands. All the sudden my skin was too pale, the blood around my stitches too brown. In my brain (what's left of it) I was dying again for the first time. Ironically, also my first memory. My mother never saw me playing in the street. The car hit me dead on. As the blood leaked from me, shivers flooded my body. Everything receded. First, the smell of my father’s stitch covered body (was he smirking?). Second, the sight of my mother’s cycloptic eye (fake tears). As light turned toward dark, I had visions of jagged white bolts coursing in my veins. This was the first beginning of many.

“After many trials and experiments, they considered me miraculous, per my ability to regain consciousness after a bolt of lightning and little repair,” I stated, switching to the next slide of my presentation. A picture of me as a young boy between two men in lab coats. My body was a playground for experiments, even then, littered with metal rods and staples. My father was certain I had his genes? Genes? What’s genetic about reattaching my head every time?

“This of course is the lab where they tested me throughout my childhood…” Trailing off, my throat ran well dry.

A classmate raised their antenna(s). I peered through the dim light. It was Nevil Samsa.

“Yes Nevil,” I pointed.

“How many times have you died?” The question was abrupt. It came as quickly as it left, and Nevil shrunk back into his seat as if embarrassed.

 “Well…well, I…” My throat clicked when I swallowed. I trailed off into an onset of sweating. My classmates snickered at the shiny droplets on my forehead. Professor Echidna smirked triumphally. This was it, another death.

“His grave is flooded, Professor Echidna!” This came from a rather fat boy in the back of the classroom with necrotic teeth. His name was Gilmar Oni; he was missing half his face. It was a miracle his brain managed to stay inside (not like it helped). His friends had created a particularly amusing game by stealing portions of it and spreading them across the school. Sometimes other kids might join the fun and use the pieces for wall ball. Gilmar would laugh oafishly at this. Then he'd get mad and roar like the ogre he was.

“That’ll be enough Gilmar!” Professor Echidna chirped. She slithered upright and faced the back of the class. Eyes (too many of them) followed her.

Directly two rows across from her sat Melanie le Fay and her coven, snickering. They all matched; crumpled brown witch hats, mole splattered faces, pale green skin. Melanie was the prettiest of the wicked lot. The rest of them were nothing short of ghoulish. Her raven black eyes twinkled like obsidian, her pale skin glowed and beckoned me. She licked her sharp teeth. I swooned. Oh darling, oh love of my life. She could kill me however many times she wanted, it would never matter.

“Well?” Professor Echidna drawled, tapping her quill. She was back in her seat, studying my gaze.

I shook my matted grey hair, snapping out of my rose-colored glasses. “To answer the question Nevil, too many times to count.”

Weak laughter. My face turned as red as it could.

I went to the next slide. An image of my parents. My father, covered in light and dark greenery, a burly hand tight on shoulder. My mother, one and only eye fixed above the camera. Fake smiles. Fake childhood.

“My family was nothing but amazed. They funded these tests. They made me who I am today. I would be nothing without them.” *I would be everything without them*.

I clicked to the next slide, which was black, save for spontaneous streams of lightning that lit the darkness. A pitiful attempt of normalcy. The words “Finis” ended my presentation, and I smiled weakly.

“Thank you,” I heard myself say.

The class smattered with weak applause, and I snuck back to my seat. Behind me, my best friend Felch Talbot patted my back with a single paw when I sat.

“You did good,” he growled. His nose probed my neck. I squirmed.

“Thanks Felch,” I murmured, poking the loose stitches on my face.

“Is it really true?”

“What?”

“That the head is active after being decapitated?”

I thought back to my presentation. *Present to the class something unique about yourself.* Professor Echidna knew what she was doing. I saw her glance at me (like prey) after she announced the icebreaker. As if there were anything to state except the obvious. *Hey guys, I'm the boy who can come back to life. Praise Jesus (aka me).* Everyone in the school had seen the stitches around my neck, the metal rods just below my ears. We were all spawn of the most infamous, a curious lot to carry a legacy. I among them was considered the vilest.

“Fifteen seconds to be exact,” I decided. Though the dead can never truly tell. It gets all murky once the blade splits the bone.

“Really?” Today wasn't the day to be curious, Felch.

I thought back again, this time to my second death. The dull blade was rising on its third attempt. My parents watched behind glass windows in sick fascination at my resilience to die. If this was love, I wanted no part of it. *The scientists know what they're doing honey, their tests will prove your ability*. Or so my mother believed. It hurt every time, but they never believed me. The blade swung down. This time, swish. Barely through the remaining muscles, ligaments, and bones. Shearing pain blinded me momentarily. My vision turned as my head tumbled onto the linoleum floor. Lab coats crouched and called my name. I watched my blood flow in streams. My eyes met theirs, then my parents. *You're a miracle boy, a goddamned miracle.* My father didn't see a son, he saw dollar signs. I was their resurrecting circus freak, their prized possession. Take a bow, Frankie. As my head rolled, I counted. In this matter, the number was discovered.

“Yes Felch. Really,” I replied. End of conversation.

While he resumed licking his fur, I watched a spawn of Cthulhu slither to the front, wringing his tendrils in anticipation. I counted his tentacles out of habit. In the back of my mind, my head kept rolling. Spinning, spinning, spinning.

One, two, three, four…
