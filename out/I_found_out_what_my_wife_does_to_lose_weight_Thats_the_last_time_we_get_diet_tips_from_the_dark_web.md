My wife Louise has started what she calls a ‘Miracle Diet’. I have to admit, I was skeptical when she first brought it up. I mean, I’m no dietician, but the whole ordeal seemed far too good to be true. 

“It’s simple, really,” Louise announced over breakfast, “I can eat everything I want, as much as I want, and still lose weight.”

“Mmm, so…what’s the catch?” I muttered, barely looking up from my phone. It’s not that I wasn’t interested in my wife’s endeavors - it’s just that she’d been trying to lose weight for years and years now, testing out all sorts of fad diets and workout regimes, but nothing had worked. 

She looked taken aback, “No catch! The only requirement is - once a day I have to eat a dish prepared according to this recipe!”

Louise held up her phone, the screen of which was loaded with text, not a single image in sight. The site itself looked like a plain .txt document, and I had to squint to actually make out any of its content.

“What is the site called?” I said, half-jokingly, wondering where on earth she’d managed to find one so outdated.

But Louise seemed flustered, snatching the phone away and stuffing it into her pocket, out of sight, “It’s just something that was recommended to me on a weight loss forum. They said it was *guaranteed* to help me attain any body shape I wanted.”

I snorted, “Don’t you think that’s a bit far-fetched, honey? I mean, losing weight - sure, but biologically…”

“Let’s just wait and see, shall we?” Louise cut me off tartly, “Doesn’t hurt to try, eh?”

I studied her, willing myself to tell her she shouldn’t get her hopes up, but only managed, “Of course, darling, whatever you say.”

I didn’t believe for a second that this new diet in the form of a .txt file was going to be the answer to her weight loss. Let me be clear - this diligent dieting was never my idea. I don’t even think Louise needs to lose weight. I mean, sure, she’s not stick thin, but that was never a prerequisite in our marriage or relationship. 

My only concern was to ensure that whatever diet she was trying out wasn’t too drastic, like that time she returned home with mysterious tablets that turned out to be tapeworm cyst pills.

“It’s not dangerous,” Louise assured after I’d expressed my incredulity, “They’d only be inside me a couple of months, and then I’d take an anti-parasite pill!”

Well, needless to say, I wasn’t on board. I told her I wasn’t going to risk her, or our family’s safety for any kind of potential weight loss. But despite wrapping it in toilet paper and carefully disposing of the blister pack, I’m not entirely sure Louise didn’t end up fishing it right back out when she knew I wasn’t looking. For the months that ensued, I was wary every time I lifted the toilet seat, lest I should find an engorged tapeworm sagging against the porcelain. 

I suppose that’s the reason I wasn’t overly concerned when Louise announced this new diet. I mean, at least she’d be eating real food instead of invertebrate eggs, so how bad could it be, right?

*Right?*

“Who’s hungry?” Louise chirped as she set the serving platter in front of us that same afternoon.

“Tacos?” I raised an eyebrow at them, “That’s the big recipe?”

I almost wanted to laugh at the sheer absurdity of it. When Louise had mentioned a “special recipe” I figured it’d be something kale or asparagus related. What kind of diet would permit any and all foods in an unrestricted amount in exchange for… for *tacos?* 

“Don’t like them?” Louise’s voice suddenly veered to a lower octave, making our son flinch, “Don’t eat them.”

I glanced up at her, startled by her change in demeanor. Her face was stark white, and a tic in her lower eyelid pulsated as though it was trying to push through altogether. 

“Honey?” I grabbed her arm, alarmed, “Are you okay? What’s wrong?”

She snatched her arm away, “Nothing. I-I’m just tired. Eat your food before it gets cold.”

So, we did. Louise didn’t eat very much, mostly just picking out the red peppers scattered around in the beef. 

“Aren’t you meant to eat this?” I asked, nodding towards her plate, “For your diet?”

She stared at me from across the table, her fingers trembling around a piece of chili pepper. A combination of irritation and angst passing across her face, she only sighed as though her newfound state was somehow my fault. I fingered the broken bits of taco shell on my plate silently, but our son didn’t seem to pick up on the cues.

“Mom?”

Louise’s fist came down on the table, making us jump. 

“Either eat your *fucking* food, or get out!”

No one dared say a word after that. In fact, no one dared say a word for the rest of the day. Not that I really had any choice either way - as soon as dinner was over, Louise flounced off and locked herself in the bathroom. She stayed there for hours on end, occasionally running the tap and turning on what I could only presume was the hairdryer. 

“Honey?” I said, knocking on the door for what seemed like the millionth time, “Are you alright? Max needs to take his bath now. How long are you planning to take?”

A series of frustrated grumbles came from the other side of the door, followed by a hoarse, “Give me a few minutes,” and a “Get away from the door.”

Puzzled, I retreated back into the living room, where Max was sprawled on the floor with a bucket of crayons. Throughout dozens and dozens of diets, I’d never seen Louise act this way before. At most, she’d be cranky due to the lack of sugar, but that was pretty much the extent of it. Alarms blared in my brain as an unwanted image of Louise bending over the toilet came to mind. No, she wouldn’t do that. That part of her life was over and done with. We’d handled it together. 

*But then… why was she running the water?* 

I silenced the voice of doom by fixating on my son’s drawing. He’d been trying to get the cat's tail right for the past twenty minutes and the floor was covered with bits of eraser. I was about to suggest helping him, when the lock of the bathroom clicked. 

I bolted down the hallway in an attempt to catch my wife before she had a chance to disappear again. I found her standing in our walk-in closet, rummaging through one of the drawers. 

“Louise?”

She jumped at the sound of my voice, slamming the drawer shut and turning to face me. She looked even worse now. Her hands were shaking and a vein protruded on her slick forehead. She was wearing her usual joggers that suddenly seemed far too loose for her frame, and a fur-lined hoodie, despite it being the middle of July. I recoiled at the sight of her, my heart picking up in my chest. 

“What are you doing?” I whispered, my mouth as dry as cotton. 

She smiled weakly, wiping her forehead with the back of her hand, “Just putting some stuff away,” she said, “I think I’ll have an early night.”

I nodded, too shocked to respond. She didn’t move, staring up at me as though waiting for what I was going to say next. I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.

“Is there anything else?” Louise’s voice had an edge to it now, “I’d like to get changed.”

I blinked at her, “Yes, of course, I’ll just go get Max ready for bed?”

She nodded, keeping her gaze locked on me as I shuffled out of the closet. 

When I finally settled down to sleep that night, the house was already quiet. Louise was breathing heavily on her side of the bed, and I knew she was fast asleep. She hadn’t said a word to me since our closet encounter and had gone to bed even earlier than Max. 

I fumbled around under my pillow for my charger, when I noticed my wife’s phone sitting on her bedside table. Maybe I could… *No, that’s snooping. I couldn’t possibly…*

Louise shifted in her sleep and I instinctively shut my eyes. In retrospect, I have no idea why that was my first reaction - my wife and I had never kept secrets from one another, and yet somehow I felt like whatever had happened that day was bigger than everything else put together. 

My eyes no wider than slits, I watched as she sat up in bed and tossed the covers to the side. She turned her head and regarded me for a minute, her expression unshrouded by sleep. *Had she been awake all this time?* 

In spite of myself, I felt a chill crawling up my spine. *Why was she watching me? What the hell was going on? And where in the world was she going at this time of night?*

I watched as she slid off the bed and stood up. She was still wearing the same joggers and hoodie she’d had on a few hours prior. Slowly, as though through great unease, she started making her way across the bedroom. *Was she limping?* She was! Her legs moved awkwardly and her lips gave way to short, labored pants. 

As soon as she was out of the room, I leaned over and grabbed her phone, jabbing at the screen with my finger. It came to life at once, and I hurriedly punched in my wife’s birth date. I wasn’t sure what I was doing or what I expected to find, but I needed answers, and at the time snooping through her phone seemed like the only logical way to get them. 

I wish I hadn’t.

The site was open on the same .txt page Louise had shown me that morning. Paragraphs of convoluted text soared by as I scrolled in a desperate attempt to find a picture, a bold heading - anything to clear up the questions Louise wouldn’t answer. 

But there wasn’t anything of the sort and I didn’t have time to go through it all before my wife returned. I was about to give up, when a series of bullet points caught my eye. Their contents will remain etched into my brain for as long as I live.

My blood ran cold. I scrolled farther, my heart going haywire in my chest.

* Apply a generous layer of silver sulfadiazine to the-

And farther…

* Use peanut oil to add flavor…

I brushed the covers away and sprung out of bed, praying my legs wouldn’t give out under me. I didn’t know where I was going. My mind was cloudy and my vision blurred, giving way to a ringing in my ears and a metallic taste in my mouth. I needed to find my wife. Surely, she hadn’t locked herself in the bathroom again, surely-

A faint clattering of dishes came from the kitchen. My stomach lurched, causing my body to break out in a cold sweat. I couldn’t even think straight anymore. *Had my wife done what I thought she had?* She wasn’t that crazy…*was she?*

As I contemplated the possibility that my wife had finally lost it, my legs carried me toward the sounds coming from the kitchen. Louise was standing with her back to me, oblivious to my presence. A brownish stain had burrowed its way through her left pant leg. A meat grinder stood in the center of the kitchen table. 

“Louise,” I whispered, leaning against the doorframe to steady myself.

“Oh!” she flushed, desperately trying to cover the contents of whatever it was she was doing with her upper body, “I-I’m just making tacos for lunch tomorrow… [Are you hungry?”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TerrorTherapy/)
