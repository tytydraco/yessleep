 

Ever since my daughter was the age of 2, She has been able to see things that I or no other family member could see. It was never anything ever scary, just little kids she would talk to or that what they would make themselves appear as. Fast forward to the year of 2018. My daughter was now 8 at the time. We had just moved into a new duplex apartment complex, Me , My daughter and 3 year old son and everything seems ok at first. Nothing was ever giving me bad vibes or anything like that. Plus my daughter had not seen a ghost in over a year at this point.

After about 2 months of staying there, I walk into my daughter room one day and she was talking to and playing with another little girl. I asked her the girl name and when did she start seeing her and she responded that she met her last week and she is a sad little girl. Now before I go any further I just want to point out that I have never felt comfortable with her seeing the things she saw and I never encouraged her to keep talking to them. In all honesty I would tell her not to interact with them and tell them to leave her alone but after years of going through it and seeing that nothing was harming her I just got use to it and just talked to her about the things she saw because in reality she couldn't help what she saw.

Now back to the story. So after she told me about the little girl I brushed it off and told her to be careful as always and to come get me and let me know if anything was ever wrong. After about a week or so I didn't hear about the little girl anymore but I didn't think too much of it because they come and go. Now also around this time things started to feel different in the house, Especially when my kids would be gone for the weekend. At night it would feel as though someone was watching me and I would hear things in the attic. Oh yeah I forgot to mention it was an attic in the duplex but I NEVER went up there EVER. Attics have always spooked me out.

So one night after getting the kids into bed I was watching TV and must have dosed off because the next thing I knew I heard my daughter screaming and crying at the top of her lungs. I immediately jumped out of bed thinking someone has broken into the house and ran straight for my kids room. When I get to the room and turn on the light, my daughter is sitting up in been still screaming but looking in the corner of the other side of the room. I grab my son and her and ask her what is wrong and she continues to scream and cry while pointing and asking "Mommy don't you see them?"

I looked to where she was pointing to a blank room and immediately knew that she was seeing something but this was different. I tried to calm her down and ask her what is it she was seeing. She than began to say "Mommy they are right there. All of them. Why can't you see them?" . At that moment I began to panic but I never showed my fear in front of her. I kept calm and asked her what are they doing. She than says they are playing instruments and laughing at her . She also says that they kept smiling at me and she shouted at them to leave me alone. Than she finally looks at me and ask me what does 666 mean. At that moment it was like my whole body went to protection mode. You would think I was scared but I immediately became enraged at the fact that my innocent child was being taunted by childish evil entities.

I grabbed her hand and rushed to my room and locked the door and did the only thing I knew to do . I prayed and called my cousin who came over to bless the room. After almost 2 hours of my child being scared and me trying to let her know nothing is going to harm her because she is protected by Jesus she finally fell asleep in my bed. You would think that after a night like that that everything would stop but NOOOO , It seemed as if I pissed one of them off. So while my kids were sleeping in my bed I had just fell asleep when something told me to wake up. I immediately woke up and for the first time ever , I saw a dark figure gliding over to where my daughter was sleep and before they could bend down to touch her I shouted at them to leave her TF alone ! Yeah I had lost my mind because the figure came over me so fast but I grabbed my bible from under my pillow and started saying the lords prayer and it went away. After that night I moved out and left all the furniture bc I didn't want anything attached to it and we never went back.
