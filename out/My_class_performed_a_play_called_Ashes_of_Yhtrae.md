The class buzzed with excitement as everyone suggested what we would do for the school festival. All kinds of ideas were thrown out there; bakesales, talent shows, haunted houses, and other things. Eventually, we decided to perform something. However, most of the plays the other students had in mind were ones that were done to death; Romeo and Juliet, the Wizard of Oz, and things like that. Mrs. Maylene, always the eccentric, said the play that we would put on had to be something interesting. Something that wasn’t done before. I wasn't going to try and find anything. In fact, I probably wasn't going to participate at all. The idea of performing in front of an audience of a hundred or more terrified me beyond rationale.

"I don't know why she won't just let us do Shakespeare," Sarah leaned against the side of the table, tilting her head to look up at me. "They're classics for a reason, aren't they? Damn hippie."

"Don't be mean," I whispered, looking around to make sure Mrs. Maylene wasn't anywhere near us. "P-plus, I think it'd be nice to do something more unique. Makes us stand out more, you know? Who knows how many other classes are doing Hamlet."

"Sure," She began, and a familiar grin spread across her lips. "Buuut, if we did do Romeo and Juliet, who's to say you can't be Juliet and a certain someone else can be your Romeo?" My cheeks flared red and I shot a glimpse at John, who just so happened to look up from his book at that exact moment. We locked eyes for a second, but I was the first to break contact, staring down at the book in my hands.

"Wh-what do you mean?" I asked, trying to play dumb.

"Wow, real subtle. I didn't even have to say a name. You really do have it bad for him." I didn't say anything in response; I only stared down at the pages without reading any of the words. Sarah was right, as usual, and I was terrible at hiding it.

After school ended and Mom picked me up, I mentioned the play in passing, causing her head to perk up. Her eyes searched the road for a lost memory, and then her face brightened. "Well, your grandpa was big into theatre back in his day. He kept a lot of his stuff in the attic. Maybe you can find something there that can give you ideas."

It wasn't a half-bad idea, aside from the fact that cobwebs no doubt covered more than half of the room. So, after I got back and ate dinner, I grabbed a flashlight and headed into the attic. When I opened the door, a cloud of dust hit my face, filling my nostrils and causing me to sneeze. It... Unnerved me. That wasn't saying much, of course; a frog croaking could have scared me. But the moment I took a step inside, I had never felt more alone. Not a single living thing was in here, and the alternative of bugs or spiders using the space as a nest now seemed more favourable.

Garbage filled every nook and cranny of the room, from old furniture and broken appliances to boxes and boxes of useless junk. Occasionally, I would happen upon a fun trinket that would distract me from the creeping sense of isolation, but even that grew tiresome. The search quickly became tedious, but just as I turned around to head back, my foot banged against a box, and pain shot through my poor pinky. I stumbled back, landing hard on the ground.

That wasn't the only thing that fell, as from the box, a wide assortment of items splayed out; eerie masks depicting countless emotions, cloaks in all sorts of murky colours, and unidentifiable props. Beneath all that was a booklet, with yellowed paper, faded ink, and binding so weak I worried that the slightest movement would tear it apart. The cover read 'Ashes of Yhtrae', and a strange spiral symbol adorned the front. As I followed the streak of black, watching as it became smaller and smaller, my mind ached, forcing me to look away from the cover. It hung above a simplistic rendition of a town, almost like a sun.

Ashes of Yhtrae was a tragedy about a town named Yhtrae and its destruction. A man named Calum encounters a strange, cloaked figure who introduces himself as The Herald, who taunts Calum with the fate of the town, claiming that it will crumble no matter what he tries. Calum, undeterred by The Herald's warning, attempts to warn the town. However, the townsfolk, gripped by fear and paranoia, accuse him of being the harbinger of their doom. In their desperation, they bind him to a stake and set him aflame.

The man's lover, a woman named Evylane, arrives far too late. As she mourns his death, The Herald arrives with a solution to her love's plight; a ritual capable of bringing the dead back to life. What she wasn't told was that the ritual required countless sacrifices in return. The town's residents are all wiped out and, though Calum does return, it is only for a few moments, as his body cannot keep itself together in this state. He collapses to dust, leaving Evylane with nothing.

It was surprisingly engaging, and I didn't even realize an hour had passed until my mom called out for me. When I brought the dusty booklet the next day and placed it on my desk, Sarah immediately snatched it with wide eyes. Intrigue painted her features as she turned it in her hands.

"Woah," She finally said, looking at me with a grin. "I didn't think you of all people would have an occult phase, but here we are."

"H-hey, it's not mine! I think it belonged to my grandpa. I found it in the attic," I grabbed the edge, trying to slide it back onto my desk, but Sarah wouldn't let go, her eyes tracing the spiral on the cover. "Um, can I please have it ba-"

"Hey, guys!" Sarah snatched it away from me, raising it into the air and waving it back and forth. "Check out what Penny found!" The other students perked up and made their way over to us. My eyes went wide as they stared at me.

"Uh, it's not-"

“What is it?” Max’s voice cut through the chatter as he pushed his way to the front. He was taller than most of the class, so the crowd parted for him easily, and Sarah could do nothing as he took it from her. His usual smirk was firmly in place, but there was an edge of curiosity in his eyes as he looked at the booklet. "It doesn't have the author or the name of the publisher or anything."

"A playwright, actually," John corrected, motioning for Max to pass him the book. Max rolled his eyes and tossed the script to John, who caught it without much difficulty. "Ashes of Yhtrae," He read aloud, sitting in the empty seat beside me. He flipped through the pages, skimming over the words. Each time he reacted, Sarah would peer over and ask what was happening, and John would summarize the scene.

"They burn him alive? That's dark. Why would anyone write that?" Sarah grimaced.

"I mean, old plays are always like that. Death, betrayal, tragedy, yadda yadda," Max brushed it off. "What makes it so special?"

"I don't know, it just is,” he murmured. “The writing’s good, though. Like, really good. It feels real.”

“Let me see!” Sarah said, practically bouncing on her toes. “Come on, read it to us! We’ll figure out if it’s worth doing.” John glanced at me, hesitation flickering in his eyes.

“You’re okay with this, right?” I opened my mouth to answer, but Sarah just shoved the book in his face.

“Just read it already, Romeo!” She whined. He sighed and cleared his throat.

"Scene One, Act One," He began. The room went quiet as he began to read, his voice low and steady. And just like that, the chatter and laughter evaporated. Every face in the room turned toward him, and I felt a chill crawl down my spine. John didn't so much as stutter once while reading as if he'd memorized it by heart. It was mesmerizing.

When he finished the closing lines of Act One, an eerie silence followed. For a moment, no one moved, their eyes fixed on him as if he were still speaking. Mrs. Maylene, who was standing in the corner, broke the spell with an enthusiastic clap.

"It's settled, then! Ashes of Yhtrae is our class play," she declared. "Does that work for everybody? We've got a winner, yeah?" Everyone cheered and clapped; the decision was unanimous. Sarah grinned, her eyes glinting with mischief.

"I think we can all agree that the main character should be played by the person who brought the script," she said, and everyone nodded their heads, their gazes fixated on me. My heart leapt to my throat, and a sudden wave of nausea overcame me.

"Wh-what? No, no way!" I shook my head frantically. "I can't! I can barely act, a-and I'd freeze up the moment I went on stage. I can't!"

"You can't run from the spotlight forever, Penny," Sarah grinned. "Plus, I think you're just being modest. I'm sure you'll be great. Right, guys?" She looked around, and they all voiced their agreement. John was the last to speak, and he hesitated for a moment.

"It'd be pretty cool to see you up there. You're the one who found the script, after all. You should get the honour." His words were like honey to my ears, and my resolve weakened. He looked at me and gave me a smile. That was the tipping point.

"Okay," I muttered, looking down at the paper.

"Oh, so him you listen to?" Max finally chimed in. "Since the ball is already rolling, why doesn't John play the male lead?"

"Well, he is dead for 50% of the play, so it's not like I have to do much," John murmured, genuinely considering it. The class erupted into discussions, deciding who would be who, what the set would look like, and where we would find props and costumes. It was a relief that everyone was happy with what I brought, but their enthusiasm was intimidating.

In the end, it was decided that I would play Evylane, John would play Calum, and Max would play The Herald (a role he got completely because of his height).

"So, should we transcribe the play and print it for everyone?" a student asked. Mrs. Maylene's expression grew stern.

“No. We can’t just copy it. You’ll have to memorize it from the source,” she said firmly, tapping the booklet. The class exchanged looks, but no one protested. After a moment, she cleared her throat and clasped her hands together. "That's enough excitement for today. Get to your seats; class is starting."

Sarah sat in the seat in front of me, spinning around to face me. Her grin hadn't faded, and a part of me wondered how her cheeks didn't ache. "Well, Evylane," She said with a snicker, "Are you excited?"

"Don't call me that," I groaned

"Awww, come on. It's just for practice," she stuck her tongue out, and I tried not to giggle.

"How would you feel if I started calling you Elsha, then?" Sarah shrugged, unfazed.

"Better than my real name." Before I could get back at her, she spun around and faced the front. After school, I made sure to transcribe the play, despite what Mrs. Maylene said. Something about the odd font and nauseating yellow paper made reading from the booklet difficult. So, when the next day came, I made copies of the script and handed them out.

"You're not supposed to have copies," Max commented as he flipped through the pages. I glanced at the floor.

"I-I know, but the original's kinda hard to read. It's not that much different, anyway." He, however, handed the copy back to me with a shrug.

"Sorry, but you heard Mrs. Maylene. We have to do this from the original. It's more authentic." I opened my mouth to retort but thought better of it. Every other student had the same reaction, and each of my copies was turned down. Just as I returned back to my seat, Mrs. Maylene's hand appeared from behind, taking every copy I had. She didn't say a word, simply tossing them in the recycling bin.

"Since you can't be trusted with the original, I think I'll be taking it from now on," I couldn't find it in myself to fight back, so I let her take the script. Her eyes lingered on the spiral, and a soft smile graced her features. "Now, shall we begin?"

Progress was unexpectedly smooth. The actors fell into their roles almost immediately, and though they hadn't memorized every single line, there were still a couple of weeks left until the festival. I, however, seemed to be falling behind. This was especially weird since I was the only one with a copy and could practise from home rather than having to read from the booklet itself. Sarah assured me that I would get it in no time.

"We have two weeks. Don't worry so much," She would tell me whenever I brought it up. Of course, she could say that she fit into her role effortlessly. It was as if she was made to play a mob leader, the way she would incite the audience and scream her lines with a crazed look in her eye. She would laugh maniacally, but no one would question if she was enjoying herself a bit too much.

She got into her role so much so that, when I came to praise her after rehearsals, a glint of disgust that no doubt came from Elsha appeared on her face. The moment it was there, however, she blinked, and it was gone, replaced by the usual grin. "Thanks! I didn't expect acting could be so fun! Usually with these school plays, I'd get bored after like, a week," she said, her smile stretching just a tad too much. "But with this, it's just... Different."

"It is?"

"Yeah, it's like... It's like a high," she admitted, "When I'm on stage, it's like nothing else matters. It's just me and the audience. Nothing can touch us. I love it." Her eyes lit up, and I couldn't help but smile. It was nice seeing her enjoy herself so much. That smile disappeared, however, after what she said next. Realizing that she was late for volleyball practice, Sarah hurried away. "Oops, gotta go! Bye, Evylane!" This time, it didn't seem like a joke.

My fears were confirmed the following days, not just by Sarah, but the entire class. Their dedication was intense, to say the least. They poured themselves into practicing their roles and reciting the lines. At first, it was funny seeing everyone so invested, but as it consumed more and more of their lives, I found it harder to laugh. Max’s changes were especially prevalent. He usually took to cracking jokes and being the loudest in the room, but since then he’d become oddly subdued.

It wasn’t until rehearsals that I realized how bad it had gotten.

He stepped across the stage, reciting the Herald’s lines with terrifying intensity. He must’ve not seen where he was going, because he’d walked straight into a wall. A sickening crunch echoed through the auditorium.

“Max!” I rushed by his side, watching blood trail down his lips and land on his shoes. “Max, are you alright?” He just looked at me with unfocused eyes. It was like he didn’t notice, his lips mouthing words I could barely hear. 

“The Herald waits where the black sun gleams,

Beyond the veil, and behind the seams.

The stars will weep at the break of day

In the ashes of Yhtrae."

“Max, snap out of it!” He shook his head, eyes widening before that trademark grin made its way across the lips.

“Was that convincing enough for ya?” He pinched his nose to stop the bleeding before jogging back to his mark, desperately trying to play it off. My stomach churned, watching as everyone else brushed it off without so much as a glance. In fact, most of the reactions were geared at me, as if I was the one overreacting. Mrs. Maylene clapped her hands together, calling for everyone to reset their positions, and the rest of the rehearsal carried on like usual.

I tried to tell myself it didn’t bother me, but the alienation was getting to me. Even Sarah, who used to be my partner-in-crime for complaining about school projects, was too wrapped up in her role to care about anything else. She hadn’t talked to me in days.

Feeling more alone than ever, I hesitated by the cafeteria doors, scanning the room. Sarah was nowhere to be seen, but John sat at his usual table, his nose buried in the script. Max sat across from him, but he quickly got up and left, his eyes staring far beyond anything in front of him.

John, though dedicated, had always seemed more grounded than the others. Maybe I was imagining things, but he didn’t look so far gone. I swallowed my nerves and made my way over, sliding into the seat next to his.

"H-hey, John. Uh, how's the history assignment going for you?" He looked up at me and blinked a couple of times.

"History assignment?"

"Yeah, the one we got last week? It's due in a couple of days," It wasn't like him to forget, but that was far from the strangest thing happening. His face darkened, and he shook his head.

"Oh. I guess I forgot about it. There are more important things to be worrying about," he said, waving his hand dismissively.

"What, the play?" I poked at the food on my plate, grimacing at the unappetizing texture. "Why is everyone so obsessed with some mediocre script?" His fist slammed on the table, making my tray jump. My heart raced as I looked up at him, his eyes burning with something I couldn’t quite place. His teeth clenched, and his knuckles were white against the table.

"It's not mediocre," he finally said. "It's not. You don't understand."

"I-I'm sorry," I stammered. "I just don't get what's happening! Why is everyone so fixated on it? Sarah's been acting as crazy as her character, Max is rarely ever lucid anymore, and now you—” I gestured toward him, my voice breaking. “Now you’re snapping at me over a stupid play! What’s wrong with you? You’ve never been like this before!”

"Because it is our life!" John growled. His face softened, and he sighed, running a hand through his hair. "I don't know why you just can't see it. It's not just words on a page, Evylane, it's-"

"Penny." I stood, taking my tray with me. "My name is Penny." He tried to protest, but I turned on my heel and left the cafeteria. As soon as I was out of his sight, I dropped my tray in the garbage and headed outside, trying not to let the tears welling up fall.

I just wanted to get over with it.

The day of the festival arrived, and the school was buzzing with activity. The smell of sweets and popcorn flooded the hallways. Students and parents alike walked past us, chatting happily. I, unfortunately, couldn't enjoy any of it, as I was far too busy helping with some "last-minute preparations" for our performance.

The atmosphere felt thick, and silence hung in the air. There was an underlying tension in the classroom, though none of the students seemed to notice. My heart pounded in my chest, and it took all I had not to panic. Just then, I felt someone bump into me. It was Sarah, adorned in a simple blue dress and a cloak.

"O-oh, Sarah, hey-" She shot me a look over her shoulder before walking away. John just patted me on the shoulder with an awkward grin.

"You can do this," He muttered, though it seemed more for his benefit than mine.

"Alright, the play's starting soon!" Mrs. Maylene announced with a wide grin. "I checked the auditorium, and it looks like it's a full house! Break a leg, everyone!" Students shuffled together like one large, multi-limbed entity, and got into position. The curtains parted, revealing a darkened stage. A spotlight shone down on John as he began to recite his monologue.

All eyes were on him, and he delivered his lines as if they were second nature. His words were filled with conviction and emotion, and the audience was eating it up. I couldn't blame them; It was mesmerizing. Then, it was my turn, and I shuffled on stage. Ignoring the countless pairs of eyes trained on me, I forced myself to recite my lines.

The first scene went smoothly, then the second, the third, and the fourth. By the end of Act One, there was no denying it; I had done great. We'd all done great. Backstage, I could see Sarah giving me a big grin paired with a thumbs-up, the hateful expression no longer clouding her eyes. As the curtains were drawn, a thunderous applause rose from the audience, and a sense of relief washed over me.

"You're doing great!" John said, patting my shoulder. His words were filled with sincerity and excitement, and it was impossible not to feel proud. Everything that had been building up the past couple of weeks deflated, and I finally let myself breathe.

"Thanks," I smiled. "So are you."

"Okay, guys, that was awesome!" The assistant director whispered. "Act Two is a lot faster-paced, so make sure you're ready! Now, get out there and do your best!"

Luckily, Evylane didn't appear at all for the rest of Act Two, meaning I could take a breather. I watched as Max, bathed in a cloak and a mask that covered half his face, recited his lines with ease. Despite his loathing for theatre, there was no denying he was good. His booming voice echoed through the auditorium, and it felt like the entire stage shook when he walked. Sarah was in top form as well, and her eyes burned with a wildness that made me shiver as she gathered the people in a frenzy.

"Now, we march!" Sarah screamed. "March to Yhtrae! March for our town! For our lives!"

The curtains were drawn once again. It was the home stretch now, and arguably my most difficult scene. But first came Calum's death. The mob wrangled with him, and though John tried to fight back, it was no use. His body was dragged onto a wooden plank, and the crowd roared in approval.

Sarah raised the lit torch with a manic grin, before tossing it at the foot of the cross. I was waiting to see how they were going to pull off the effects but as the orange serpentines curled up the stake, the scent of smoke tickled my nostrils and a realization dawned on me; there was no effect.

John screamed. The flames grew larger and hotter, and the scent of burning flesh wafted through the air. It wasn't an exaggeration or a trick. The fire was real, and John was burning alive. The audience watched on in a mix of horror and awe; to them, it was all theatrics, but hearing them applaud his "performance" only made the pit in my stomach deepen.

The mob dissipated backstage, and it was my turn to get on stage. My steps were shaky and stiff. Tears stung my eyes. The charred corpse hissed and steamed. John was unrecognizable.

"N-no..." I whispered, "Calum!" I said the word John, I know I did. But my tongue betrayed me, and instead, that cursed name left my lips.

Slow, methodical footsteps approached from behind, and a towering figure stepped into view. I turned around, expecting to see Max, but the man before me was not him. His shadow stretched over the stage, and the light above seemed to flicker as it struggled to illuminate him. The cloak enshrouding his body writhed as if it were a living creature, and the smiling mask he wore seemed to blink and breathe.

"Hello, Evylane," The voice that greeted me was a low, warbling growl, like a parrot mimicking a human's words.

I didn’t want to respond. I didn’t want to move, breathe, or even exist in his presence. Every nerve in my body screamed to flee, to vanish into the shadows, but that choice didn’t belong to me. Not anymore.

"Who are you?"

"A nomad, a scholar, a performer, an observer," The man listed, counting each title on his long, slender fingers. "But more importantly, I come bearing gifts." He stretched his arm out and presented to me his pale, unblemished palm. Fingers tipped with talon-like claws unfurled, revealing his palm. A symbol was carved into his flesh, a jagged, uneven spiral, dripping blood and pus. "Paint this upon your dear Calum's corpse, and the ritual shall commence. He will live again. Is that not what you desire, Evylane?"

No matter how hard I tried to break eye contact, it was as if the man’s dark, hollow eyes had rooted themselves in mine, holding me captive. I had felt the pull before—a subtle, nagging whisper that I might have shaken off if I tried hard enough. But now, with the stage set and his presence looming over me, that whisper had grown into an unrelenting roar. It was too late to turn back. He was here, and there was no escaping him.

"Y-yes..." I said, the words foreign. His hand disappeared in the sleeve of his cloak, before turning with uncanny precision, disappearing into the darkness. Once he was gone, I dug my nails into the palm of my hand, blood seeping through the wound. With shaking fingers, I traced the symbol atop his red, burnt flesh.

For a moment, the world was holding its breath. Not a sound filled the air, not from the actors nor the audience. Then, the first scream split the silence, high and piercing, followed by a guttural choking that made my stomach drop. An actor, playing a villager, collapsed to their knees and clutched their head, shrieking in agony. Before long, every actor was screaming and convulsing. Blood poured from their eyes in thick, glistening streams.

The crimson liquid swirled in the air, writhing like serpents, before plunging into where the symbol was drawn. The spiral began to glow, painting the entire room in an eerie, vile yellow. Stage lights flickered, swaying back and forth. I felt my skin burn with the skyrocketing temperature, and each laboured breath felt like inhaling ash.

Sarah's face twisted in agony, clutching at her throat desperately. She writhed on the ground for a moment before turning to face me, a familiarity I thought was lost forever gracing her features. I wanted to scream her name, but it felt like my lungs were filled with cement. She mouthed something to me before her eyes rolled to the back of her skull, joining the rest of the actors.

The audience’s applause faltered confusion and fear replacing their admiration as screams began to rise. I watched in horror as, random members of the audience writhed in the same manner, being drained of all their blood. Those who weren't chosen cried and screamed, scrambling to the exit. It was pandemonium. Before long, the suspended bodies dropped. The stage lights flickered back on.

John’s corpse writhed, and a sickening crunch drew my attention back to it. Skin began to form, grafted onto the body with little tact. Muscles, bones, organs – all of them were stitched back together. Most sickeningly yet, I was beginning to recognize John. Though incomplete, his features—the ones I had come to know and love—were beginning to form.

He opened his eyes, his gaze locking with mine. In those black, bottomless pools, I could see my own face reflected back at me, tear-stained and broken. His body was barely holding on, and the recreation left him disfigured. He smiled nonetheless, and the soft expression finally tore through my stupor. I wrapped my arms around him, profusely apologizing.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" My words were choked by the sobs rising from my throat. This is all my fault! If I didn't bring the play, none of this would've happened! I-it's all my-" He hushed me.

"The play must go on," he murmured, "We're not done yet." I swallowed hard and nodded. A kiss. That was how the play ended. I took a deep breath, trying to still my shaking hands, and leaned in. As our lips touched, his body turned to ash, collapsing into me like a burnt-out ember. His soot clung to my skin, cold and lifeless.

In the suffocating silence that followed, a single sound rose—a slow, deliberate clap. The hollow echo of Mrs. Maylene’s applause filled the room. I turned to her as the curtains drew, the manic grin carved into her face the last thing I saw. The remainder of our class joined her, applauding with the same fervour.

"Bravo!" She cheered, her grin widening further. "Absolutely phenomenal! Especially you, Penny!"

Then, darkness overtook me. When I woke, the police had stormed the building, and Mrs. Maylene was in custody. They called it a "mass indoctrination" that led to mass suicide, but I knew better. Everyone who was there did. Those of us who survived were sent to the hospital. I especially was bombarded with an officer’s incessant scrutiny. I answered question after question, each one more pointed than the last. I told them everything. They didn’t believe me, of course, but thanked me for my cooperation.

"One last thing, if you don't mind," the officer asked, "We've accounted for all but two missing students."

"I already told you, John is gone," I murmured, the words catching in my throat.

"Y-yes, but, well, there's someone else that hasn't been accounted for," he explained, flipping through the clipboard. "A boy named Max Haddock."

The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. I felt my lungs failing me, shallow breaths escaping my lips. That indescribable pressure returned—the weight that had crushed me when The Herald stood before me.

“Miss?” The officer’s voice was distant, fading in the background as I slowly turned to face the windows. Beneath a lamppost that shined a vile yellow spotlight, a figure stood.

Tall. Cloaked. Watching.
