I don’t talk about my childhood much. People ask why I’m so quiet, and I usually just shrug. It’s easier that way. But lately I’ve been having trouble sleeping, and the things I’ve been remembering aren’t the kind you can ignore. I need to get this out before it stays inside me forever.

My name doesn’t matter. Call me whatever you want. I was the youngest of four. We lived in a small house on the south side of Chicago. The kind of place that looked fine from the street but felt wrong the second you stepped inside. Peeling paint. Floors that creaked even when no one walked on them. Air that stayed heavy no matter how many windows you opened.

My parents were there, but not really. Dad worked long shifts and came home angry at everything that wasn’t work. Mom tried to keep things together, but she forgot things — where she put her keys, what day it was, that she had kids waiting for dinner. 

My older sister Liz made lists on the fridge that never got checked off. My little sister Maggie drew pictures of houses with too many windows and people too small to fill them. And then there was James. My older brother. The only one who really saw me.

James was the one who taught me how to breathe when the house got loud. He’d stand nearby without looking at me, just slowing his own breathing until I matched it. In through the nose. Out slower. Like he was pulling the panic out of the air. He fixed things around the house — stuck drawers, loose handles — but mostly he fixed the quiet.

 He sang Mom’s old lullaby wrong on purpose to make me laugh when no one else would. He told me waiting was better than being wrong. He said if you stay still long enough, people forget to be mad at you.

April 4th, 1991. That’s the date I remember clearest. I was eight. James had just left. Packed a bag in the middle of the night. Kissed Maggie’s forehead, waved at Liz, put his hand on my head for one second. His fingers shook. He said he’d come back for us. He didn’t.

Three weeks later the police came. They used careful words. “River Road.” “Tunnel.” “Accident.” They said James was old enough to make his own choices. They said boys run away sometimes. They said the tunnel was dangerous and it wasn’t my place to ask questions. After that, no one talked about him. The house got quieter. Sharper. Like the walls were listening for the sound of him coming back.

I tried to disappear the way James taught me. Walk soft. Breathe small. Don’t remind anyone you’re there. It worked too well. At school teachers looked past me. Kids stepped around me like I was furniture. At home, plates got set for three kids instead of four. Sometimes I’d sit at the table and no one noticed I hadn’t eaten. I stopped asking for things. It felt safer.

Then they sent me to St. Mary’s Home for Boys. The orphanage smelled like bleach and old books. Clocks didn’t match. Lights buzzed. Boys slept in rows of beds that were too close together. Mrs. Kimber ran the place. She checked her watch before she spoke, like time owed her something. “You’ll settle in,” she told me. “Boys always do.”

I found the library first. Not a real one — just shelves of donated paperbacks and dust. But the rules were steady. Take a book. Bring it back. Put it where it belongs. I liked that. I liked knowing where things went.

The first night I lay awake listening to the other boys sleep. Some snored. Some cried quietly. I counted breaths the way James showed me. Then I heard footsteps. Soft. Careful.

The mattress dipped. A knee. A hand grabbed my shirt collar and yanked. Buttons strained against my throat. I opened my eyes.
A boy my age stared down at me. Face half in shadow. Eyes hard. He leaned close. “Don’t make noise,” he whispered.

I tried to breathe slow. In. Out. But my chest jumped. He shoved something against my head — fist or bedframe, I don’t know. White sparks. Pain bloomed fast. I made a small sound. He hit again. My ear rang. He twisted my wrist. “Stay still.”

He pressed his palm over my mouth. Pushed my face into the pillow until I couldn’t breathe. Lungs kicked. Numbers in my head broke apart. He slammed my head against the wall once. Not hard enough to kill. Hard enough to leave a mark.
“You don’t get to be quiet here,” he said. “Quiet makes people look.”

Then he left. Like it was nothing. I lay there tasting metal. No one moved. The building kept every sound.

In the morning I told Mrs. Kimber. “Someone was at my bed.” She sighed. “Nightmares.” I shook my head. “I wasn’t asleep.” She smiled thin. “Boys get carried away.”

The nurse bandaged my head. Asked who did it. I stared at the floor. “I don’t know.” Because naming it would make it real. And real things get bigger.

After that, four boys started sitting near me. Gage. Redd. Dax. Cole. They laughed loud. Talked over each other. Dared stupid things. They acted like friends. Shared snacks. Told jokes. For the first time since James left, someone noticed me on purpose. It felt good. Dangerous good.
Gage suggested a game. No name.

Just “something fun.” We’d go to the old tunnels under the city. Explore. See what was down there. I said yes. I wanted to belong somewhere.
We went at night. Flashlights. Sneaking past fences. The tunnel smelled like wet concrete and rust. Echoes bounced wrong. Gage led. 

He laughed when I tripped. Redd pushed me forward. Dax whispered jokes that weren’t funny. Cole stayed quiet, watching.

Deeper in, the light dimmed. Gage stopped. Turned. “Your turn,” he said.
They made me stand in the middle. Told me to close my eyes. Count to a hundred. Said it was part of the game. I did. One. Two. Three…

When I opened my eyes, they were gone.
Flashlight on the ground. Flickering. Their laughter echoed from farther away. Then silence. I called out. No answer. I ran. Tripped on rails. Cut my hands. Knees. Face. The tunnel twisted. I couldn’t tell which way was out. Blood in my mouth. Lungs burning.

I don’t know how long I was down there. Hours. Days. I sat against the wall eventually. Stopped calling. Started listening. The way James taught me. In. Out. Slow.

That’s when I heard it. Not footsteps. Not voices. Breathing. Close. Slow. Like someone matching mine.

I looked up. A boy stood at the edge of the light. Eight years old. Pale. Blonde hair with dirty tips. White t-shirt under a navy jumper. Black trousers. Red sneakers. Blue eyes wide. He didn’t move. Just watched.

I whispered, “Who are you?”
He didn’t answer. Just tilted his head. Like he was listening too well.

I stood. Backed away. He stepped forward. Same slow breath. In. Out. Matching mine exactly.
I ran again. Scraped through narrow gaps. Cut deeper. Eventually light appeared. Street level. I crawled out. Ambulance came. Bandages. Questions. I said I fell. Mrs. Kimber blamed me. Punished me. Said I caused trouble.

I disappeared a week later. Not on purpose. I just… left. Walked out one night. No one looked for me long. Missing poster went up. Then down.
Now I drive at night sometimes. When I can’t sleep. I look in the rearview mirror. And he’s there. In the backseat. Same jumper. Same sneakers. Same eyes. Watching. Breathing slow. Matching mine.

I don’t look back for long. Because when I do, things happen. Small at first. Forgotten memories surface. Old hurts reopen. People I love start forgetting little things. Then bigger ones.
I don’t know what he wants. Maybe he just wants someone to notice. To listen. To remember he was there.

But I can’t look too long. Because the longer I look, the more I forget who I am.
And the more he starts to look like me.

(If anyone’s driven through Chicago at night and felt someone breathing in the backseat… don’t turn around. Just keep driving. And breathe slow.)
