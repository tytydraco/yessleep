Hi, as the title says, my house has been growing hair. But before anybody makes a gross or "smart" comment about *what* kind of hair my house is growing; please let me elaborate, I need advice.

About three weeks ago I got a promotion at my job. It wasn't all great as I had to move out of the city to a small town where I didn't know anybody. Just me, my pet cat, and crippling student loans that this new job would hopefully help pay off in half the time.

My job gave me a few choices of housing payment free. The first choice was a delapadated studio apartment above a busy dive bar that would make a crack house blush, a sprawling 8 bedroom farm house about a hour drive either way in and out of the town that I could in no way keep up myself, and lastly; my current residence. A nice, cozy slight fixer upper of a 2 story house at the end of a caul da sac.

There were only 6 houses on my bloc including myself and 4 of which were unoccupied as the city was tearing the rest down to make townhouses in an attempt to boister the city's dwindling population. The town had a rep as a sleepy retirement town where one sort of...goes to die I guess? Well, as many of the folks were passing on, I guess they thought it was time to change all that. 

My new house had the honour of being some historic land mark where a war hero resided in years past. For being what was such a special residence, I had a hell of a time digging up just about anything on the guy who lived here before me. All I could find were some clippings about him returning from Vietnam with 118 confirmed kills and many medals I didint know the meaning behind.

Now it was just me and biggs, my tubby Siamese cat.

The first night in the house was completely normal. The scariest thing being the leaky faucet emanating a monotonous *drip drip drip* I would have to fix among loose floor boards and other small, annoying defects.

The weirdness would begin the following morning.

I got up at 7am to find my kettle and grab a jar of instant coffee from one of the many unmarked boxes in my living room (I know, I'm an unorganized mover) when in one of the boxes, I found a busted up, burnt and beat eyeless baby doll that looked like it was being held together by sheer willpower.

"Weird" I remember thinking "must have belonged to my sister" when the things fucking head started to spin around and it began to chant some lullaby in a dialect I was unfamiliar with.

At the time, I just thought the thing was busted, I didn't even pay half a mind when I threw the thing out about a dozen times and it somehow always found it ways back. Between my new job and the other oddities that needed to be delt with around the house; which brings us to the sneezing fireplace.

I moved to my house in late September and the temperature was falling fast. Luckily for me, I had an open brick fireplace in the basement with a woodpile next to it ready for use.

I built my first fire when and began warming my hands up when it blew out towards me with a *chewf!!* 

"Excuse me?" I asked agitated. I built a couple more fires, the third being the most successful but the flames danced and...formed into a movie? It's hard to explain but the embers changed and contorted to show what looked like the massacre of a foreign village with one man leading the charge, lobbing gernades into houses and slaughtering whole family's. 

So yeah, my fireplace is broken too.

I went upstairs and started googling local repair companies as this was *FAR* out of my wheelhouse when Biggs poked his head around the corner of the kitchen and started mewing next to his food bowl.

"Hey buddy, you hungry?" I asked.

Biggs turned to look at me before rising to his hind legs and bellowing in a voice 3 octaves too deep for him "LEAVE NOW, OR PAY WITH YOUR LIFE" before walking away, bi pedal.

This really scared the shit out of me.

I knew Biggs was behind on his shots but I didint think anything this serious would come of it. If this lead to fleas on top of everything else I didint know what I would do. I called the vet and made Biggs an appointment for the first thing in the morning.

So I had been living at the house for about a month now and trying to patch up what little things I could like the aforementioned leaky faucet and loose floorboards, when in my bedroom, under one of the boards I missed, I found a shoe box with old Polaroids of the front of the house with a man and seventeen Vietnamese children standing in front of it. I recognized the guy as the old owner of the house and damn, seventeen kids? This guy got around. 

I put the shoebox in my closet and forgot about it.

I bet many of you are probably wondering how my new job was going and you wouldn't believe it, but working in sales for a company that produces cardboard boxes was actually pretty fun! In fact, im kind of the office comedian. Once I changed the lunch room sign to say "brunch room" ha! Sorry guys, Turkey sandwich? Oh no no this is the *BRUNCH* room. Comeback when you have a soft boiled egg and toast or something. 

Needless to say I made plenty of friends off the bat and decided it was time to throw a little house party. The only problem being was that now my house had decided to start growing hair in the living room.

It started out as little pointy dark hairs that look like something that would grow out of a mole on your face, but slowly graduated to wiggly eyelash like hairs. I tried cutting them but they were too strong and I broke a pair of good kitchen scissors on them.

So I'll admit, I got a little dramatic and took a sledgehammer to the wall. What I did not expect were the DOZENS OF BONES THAT SPILLED OUT FROM BEHIND IT!! 

Now I have a hairy living room, a crying baby doll, a talking cat and a fireplace that plays old war movies. Guys, if you know anybody that can fix even *ONE* of my problems by next Saturday, please please *PLEASE* let me know. Im in the lower east end of Maryland and throwing my party in a hairless, doll free house would mean the world to me, thank you.
