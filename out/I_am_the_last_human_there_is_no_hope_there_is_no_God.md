Another morning without food, James went out searching last night, like usual he found nothing, thts how it's been for as long as any of us can remember, how long has it been? 10, 100, 10,000 years?

We've all lost track, anyways we just decided to continue our journey, Bill claimed that he found some food last night, he said that it was in a cave, all the food we could eat, of course James and I don't really believe him, but at this point we really don't have a choice but to follow Bill.

I looked up in the sky, and like usual 'The Eyeball' was there, staring down at us, The Eyeball has kept us alive for as long as I can remember, making sure we suffer.

Bill gets it the worst, there used to be 4 of us, but he ate Frank, Bill bit off his face first, he was so hungry that he lost his sense of humanity in that moment, The Eyeball was angry, he took Bill somewhere and James and I didn't see him for what i think was 3 years, I don't even know when an hour passes anymore.

When Bill came back he didn't even look human, he looked like a demon, something you'd see from Hellraiser, but somehow worse, Bill's eyes are where his nipples should be, his mouth is on his forehead, his hands... well you're better off not knowing.

The Eyeball appeared one day, I saw everyone around me burning in a slow and painful death, but for some reason I of all people was spared, I was dragged to the things belly, there I met Frank, Bill and James

Frank was an asshole, I'm honestly glad that Bill ate his face and gave that bastard a slow and painful death... James is no better, his preaching of God and how he'll make everything better for us, we'll James tell me this, if there was a God, would he let whatever The Eyeball is keep is as his playthings for literal MILLENNIUMS... I don't think so.

Bill's the only one I like, mainly because of what he did to Frank, but The Eyeball was mad because he lost oneof his playthings, honestly im hoping Bill did find food so that we can eat it in front of James's big stupid face.

So the 2 of us started to follow Bill, of course The Eyeball was watching our every move, Bill said that its not that far, I want to believe him but I cant...

The Eyeball is just floating there, never saying a word, I don't know where it came from or what it even is... Bill hasn't spoken a word about his experience inside of it, he only told us the words it spoke to him, he remembers them and has vividly spoken them numerous times

When we arrived at the cave, the food was there, but... it was inedible, this was just The Eyeball fucking with us... James went ballistic, he started banging a rock against the walls, he was crying and laughing sadistically, then the cave started to crumble, we tried to escape... first Bill got his head crushed by a Boulder, he twitched for a few minutes... then nothing

James was impaled by a spike that fell from the ceiling, I saw a smile on that bastards face as he died, of course like before I was the only one spared from the massacre...

Humanity... is gone...
