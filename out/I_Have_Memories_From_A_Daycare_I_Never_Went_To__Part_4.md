I’ve asked my mom to keep an eye out for my collection of Pokémon cards. Not that proving the cards weren’t at the daycare would exactly *absolve* my memories from carrying the weight they do. It would just be another piece that could add some comfort to my thoughts, were they to turn up, I guess. They haven’t yet. I’m losing hope that they will. The more I picture the colorful little pieces of cardboard, the more I visualize them resting somewhere within the nooks and crannies of Mrs. Rand's. 

She didn’t release that artificial smile from her face for the rest of my time there. Her eyes remained flat as a board and she continued to fully train her head on whatever she aimed to look at. She was seemingly reduced to a select number of phrases. All of them were uttered in her new, overly chipper voice. 

“I’ll fix you all some lunch!” she would say whenever she made her way into the kitchen. She continued to prepare nothing and serve it on plates and Cory continued to pressure us into pretending to eat it. 

“I better do some cleaning up in here!” she would say whenever any level of house work needed doing.

“You’re so silly!” she would say in any other scenario. It quickly became her default phrase of choice whenever the other two weren’t quite appropriate. 

I did my best to avoid Mrs. Rand’s flattened gaze. Not for fear of harm. She didn’t come off as particularly dangerous, but her new demeanor was such a stark contrast to the Mrs. Rand that I had first met. She was like a mannequin now. Nothing more than a display of the household. A decorative appliance that seemed to be there as ambience, reminding everyone that this was supposed to be a daycare and not a random house full of scared children. 

I couldn’t stop staring at the tall house in the days following Sarah’s ‘choice’. Still tall and uncanny in the distance. The bottom still obscured by the forest. But now the *lights* were on. They had been ever since Sarah had left to wherever the room on the computer was. You couldn’t quite tell on sunny days, but when dark clouds hung over as they had most of the following week, you could. Every window in every one of the different colored houses making up the tower glowed with an orange yellow light. I would stare out the window at it, trying to see if I could make out any movement in any of the windows. I never could. 

The monochromatic screen of the computer still remained on as always, and Sarah was always sitting in the concrete room now. Now that Mrs. Rand didn’t watch us quite as closely as she used to, it was easy to wander the house as I pleased. I searched everywhere for a door that might lead to the room Sarah was being held in and I covered nearly every square inch of the daycare. I even went into what was supposedly Mrs. Rand’s bedroom. There wasn’t any mystery door and hidden hatch or anything that could have led to where Sarah was. Looking back, what I was seeing on the Mac could have been looping footage already long past or it could have been a live feed to somewhere else or… well I don’t know what else. It could have *anything* I suppose. There are infinite possibilities in a house where women’s eyes are flattened for upsetting a strange child. 

When I realized there was no real way for me to help Sarah, I took to covering the computer’s screen with a towel or a pillow or whatever or whatever I could find. The more I looked at Sarah setting, doing nothing in that room, the worse I started to feel. Someone would always remove what I put over the screen. I suspect it was Cory. He caught me in the act one time when I was about to cover it with a washcloth I got from the bathroom. He appeared right behind me without a sound like he had done before.

“You know you’re going to have to choose one day, same as her!” he said, his voice high and sing-song. I didn’t know how to reply to him as I so rarely did.

“Okay.” I said absently, looking back at him. 

“It’s just a good thing to be prepared for! Have you thought about which one you’re going to want to go with?” he asked.

“No… no not really.” I grew more sheepish with every word. Cory just kept grinning. 

“Well think about it! *Dance*, be *cut*, or *remain*! Everyone has to make it! Even I did!” His scar stretched and gleamed in the light as he showed his teeth in a prideful smile. “Now I get to help others make their choice!” 

I only nodded. The words ran cold and dry in my throat. Cory kept my gaze, the smile still long on his face, and we were silent for a few moments. Then he giggled and ran off. 

I needed some semblance of answers for all of this but being an eight year old doesn’t afford you many resources. I knew what vaguely had to be done but at the very least I needed a co-conspirator, so I turned to Jasper. 

“We need to get out when everyone goes into the crawl space.” I told him.

“Why would we all go into the crawl space?” he asked me.

“The *wax people*.” I said in a whisper. “Sarah had a friend that disappeared and after the wax people came. Now that Sarah’s gone I bet they come again. When they do we might find out where Sarah is.” 

It was a bad plan. One that an eight year old who hasn’t experienced real terror would create. Jasper was put off but when I said I’d be fine doing it alone, he relented. As afraid as he was, he wasn’t the type of person to let a friend wander into the dark by themself. We bided our time, filling the days with juvenile games and imaginary meals. The lights in the tall house remained on and the afternoons became drab and unsettling, like a fog of fear and oddity was filling the whole place. Eventually the time came. 

It was a bright sunny day at around noon when Mrs. Rand gathered us downstairs. 

“Into the crawlspace children! My guests won’t want us here!” she said, ushering us into the door under the stairs. 

It was jarring to hear something that was unique from her typical three phrases. Some of the kids asked what was going on to which she would just repeat herself. She even copied the cadence perfectly every time. I didn’t ask what was happening. I knew *they* were coming. I positioned myself at the back of the line and kept an eye out, not only for where Mrs. Rand’s flat gaze was pointing, but also for *Cory*. Though he didn’t seem to be with us. I couldn’t see him at all actually. I looked at Jasper and he met my eyes. When Mrs. Rand’s head was turned, we slipped away and quietly ran to the upstairs bathroom. After a couple minutes when no one came for us, we knew we were in the clear.

Jasper twisted the handle and slowly opened the door. We were greeted with darkness. All the lights were off, despite them being on not three minutes ago. Had Mrs. Rand gone and shut them all off before joining the others? There was something else wrong though. It was too dark even for that to be true. The *windows* didn’t have any light pouring from them either. It was as if the sun had set hours ago. As if it hadn’t been noon before we hid. There were only two sources of light I could make out. The lights from the tall house when I looked out the window… and the gray flicker of the computer screen. Sarah was standing and pacing around the concrete room.

Jasper joined me at the window and we waited, gazing into the dark backyard. It was light enough to make out shapes but only just. I could see the jungle gym and the fence but it was like an artificial darkness. The sun and the stars had been stolen away and that left reality confused on what to portray to our eyes. 

“You think they’ll come from this way?” Jasper asked in a hushed voice. I nodded.

“They live in the tall house. That’s what Sarah said.” I said. Before too long, Sarah was proven *correct*.

Light, obscured shapes started appearing at the back line of the fence, gathering one by one. I couldn’t see them well in the obscurity of the hazy dark, but I knew they were people. They moved wrong, however. In fact, I never saw them move at all, but they got closer. When I would blink or focus on another one of the shapes, the unviewed would make progress. I saw one frozen and statuesque as it was hopping the fence. One had already gotten over and had its arms in the air .I assumed it would have been doing a wild spinning motion had I not stayed it with my gaze. 

The forms eventually gathered closer to the house in front of the jungle gym. They constantly moved, but I didn’t see one do it. I caught them all in odd poses when I looked. Their arms in the air. Their steps were jagged and uneven. It took me a bit to realize what I was witnessing, but when I did my throat ran dry. It was a *dance*. A great, uncanny display that was never meant to be seen. I was seeing snapshots of a dark and unworldly performance. 

I glanced at Jasper to see what he thought and he glanced back. Pure terror filled his face. I would never know how my own looked but it couldn’t have been too different, especially considering that all the figures stood in a line when I brought my gaze back to them. I got a good look at them now. Their clothes were multicolored and ragged. Undersized and torn. Their skin was the color of long spoiled milk and had patches that were uneven, especially of their bare scalps. Like overused candles left to burn, the wax drippings running down the sides. Their eyes didn’t seem to contain anything other than flat pools of whitish-yellow and their mouths hung open in what could have almost been seen as a gaping smile. It was undeniable that every one of them was looking up… right at Jasper and I’s window. 

“You are not the one we’ve come for.” Jasper and I said in perfect unison. We looked at each other quickly. Tears filled his eyes and this time I didn’t have to wonder about the terror plastered on my face. They had talked *through* us. It was the strangest thing I’ve ever felt to this day. When we looked back down at the yard, they were all gone. 

We heard the windows of the other room creak open.

“Dance with us.” we said. I think I remember Jasper starting to cry. I grabbed his wrist as I dragged him to the stairs. As we passed the hall I saw one at the very end, caught still in its movements. We descended the stairs into the entryway and saw that the front door had been opened. When we turned to the stairs that led down to the basement, I saw another one crawling over the kitchen table. It was reaching its hand out when I froze it. 

“Dance with us.” we said again, Jaspers rendition coming out in a sob. I brought us down stairs and there were already two standing on the shag carpet, their arms at their sides and their mouths hanging open. They blocked the door to the crawlspace.

“Dance with us. Dance with us.” we said. I brought us past them and to the only space left to us: the toy room. When we were in I slammed the door and threw the lock. The banging started immediately. It was rhythmic, keeping a steady beat of assaults on the wood. I saw one's face pressed against the window and I slid the blinds shut. Tears started to obscure my vision now and Jasper sat in a ball on the floor. Knowing there was nothing more I could doubt hope, I joined him, clutching my knees to my chest.

“Dance with us.” we said through our tears as the door rattled on beat. “Dance with us. Dance with us. Dance with us.” We couldn’t stop saying it. It felt like hours passed. This was eternity and imagining a world that wasn’t the horror of this toy room was an impossibility. I looked around as I unwillingly murmured. I saw blood and sewing equipment scattered on the floor. I saw something else, too. They looked like large, bloody contact lenses. I tucked my face in my knees when I realized. 

After months and years of sitting on the ground. Crying and saying unwilled words with Jasper, the banging on the door stopped. The handle began to vibrate and twist. *A* *key*, I thought in horror. The door swung open and light poured in, revealing Mrs. Rand and her terrible smile under her flat eyes. 

“You’re so silly!” she said, beckoning us out of the room. We rose and did as she wanted. Light filled the house again and the outside looked as it did. Bright and sunny. The wax people lived only in my memory now. All the kids were gathered outside to see our tear stained faces as we left. Jasper trembled horribly and he curled up on the couch. When I gathered a bit more of my courage and sanity back I went back upstairs. I went to the Mac computer. 

When I saw the screen, the concrete room was empty. Sarah was gone and dread filled my heart. I walked back to the window and looked out over the trees at the tall house. Its lights were off. A voice rang from behind me. I didn’t jump this time. I had grown used to him appearing like this.

“She’ll do a much better job than Mrs. Rand when she's ready!” Cory said over my shoulder. I turned to face him. He was smiling as he usually was. His scar, shiny and wrinkled on his cheek. I didn’t say anything. I didn’t have any words left. “Think about that choice, Ben! It’s an important one.” His chipper voice dropped to a subtle satisfaction in the last sentence and his smile lowered to a knowing grin. We kept the silence for another moment… and he left without another word or even a giggle. 

That wasn’t the last time I was at Mrs. Rand’s daycare but it was the last thing of note I remember. Mrs. Rand was still a terrifying and broken presence, Cory was still odd and unnerving, and Jasper didn’t say much to anyone, especially me. My family moved away a few weeks after that and I think I told myself that those moments were a nightmare. I must've compartmentalized it somehow for it not to have been at the front of my mind. Now that I have the memory again I don’t know what to do. 

I’ve decided I need real answers. I *need* to know what actually happened to me and to the rest of the kids. Obviously I never saw any of them again after my family left. I dread to think what happened to them. To think of the answers they gave to Cory’s *choice*. To think of how high the tall house has gotten. 

I’ve put in for the time off work and I’m driving to Racine. I need to see the house again.
