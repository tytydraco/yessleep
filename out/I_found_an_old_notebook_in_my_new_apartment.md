I don’t know if this is the right place for this, but I found something that freaked me out in my new apartment and I need to tell someone about it.

So like I said, I just moved into a new place. Nothing spectacular, one room, I won’t go into it. It was unfurnished when I first moved in, and I spent my first few nights in a barren room, laid out on the floor, by the soft glow of a single lamp. The apartment is not huge, but on those nights, empty, it felt chasmic. I would lie there, scanning every detail of this new space.

I noticed, in the corner, an irregularity. It was so minor I’m amazed I was able to spot it. A floorboard, maybe a foot in length, rose millimetres above the floor on one side. It was minuscule, easily forgotten about. But I’m the type of person that will obsess over a hangnail until I’m able to fix it. The irregularity in the floorboards pierced me like a dart through the eye. I pulled off my duvet and crawled like dog in the dim light over to the board. I pressed down on the risen side and found it wouldn’t budge. By a single finger tip, I gripped it, and pulled upwards. It gave way ever so slightly. My mother’s voice suddenly echoed silently in my head, a remnant from when I was young and had a scab on my knee - “don’t pick”.

From one of my boxes of things to unpack, I dug out a Swiss Army knife, a gift from my father when I went to university, and drew out the flat head screwdriver. I jammed it into the gap between the floorboards and pushed down. The odd floorboard began slowly rising upwards, until finally, it gave way completely, popping out and leaving a dark, rectangular hole in the floor. I’d been here just three days and I was already tearing the place apart. I shone my phone light down into the shallow pit, and saw something.

A notebook. Pocket sized, mottled with age and environment, warped by damp and mottled with specks of mould. The bindings creaked slightly as I opened it up. Some of the words written within had bled out with the damp, leaving some passages illegible.

The following are some of the passages from the notebook. The first few pages have become completely unreadable so these are from the middle. Let me know what you think.

“First meeting today. There is a girl there, whom I will call L. She reached out to me, chatted. She js incredibly pretty. Clearly intelligent. Normal, acceptable, wonderful. In the time since she has occupied all of my thoughts. These feelings are not romantic, not sexual. She is like a rare flower in this paradise lost.”

“Beginning to ingratiate myself with the group, with L. Cannot say if it will stick. L was crying today during the meeting. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. I offered a hug after, and she accepted. It’s nice to know she doesn’t mind being close to me.”

“(Illegible) blush on her cheeks, rose petal lips. She is daylight. I refuse to love her.”

“I can’t stop thinking about it. The warmth, the pressure, the acidity. She is the thought of home when you’re alone in the cold. My lips on her skin. Communion. Sacrament. The blood of Christ.”

“YOU HAVE BEEN DOMESTICATED”

“I feel her drifting. She’s not close enough. I need her closer, as close as possible. Skin to skin, b(illegible). I worry sometimes that I want to love  her more than I actually do. That I’ve chosen her, placed her on a pedestal, an alter, my sacred totem. I wish I could turn her off sometimes, (illegible) oblongata(?), preserve her somehow, keep her as some kind of doll.”

So yeah. That’s a few of the passages in the book.

Who the fuck rented this apartment before me?
