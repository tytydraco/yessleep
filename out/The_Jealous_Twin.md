This is a story narrated to myself by a distant relative of mine who lives in the suburban regions of Colombo, Sri Lanka. A bit about my distant relative’s family background before I move in detail towards the story.

  
My distant relatives’, (Let’s call him “Nick”) mother’s mother (Nick’s Grandmother and let’s call her “Reeta”) had an identical twin sister (Lets call her “Melanie”). Only Nick’s Grandmother got married and bore kids while her twin sister Melanie had to face a tragedy early into her own marriage where her husband succumbed to an illness. Shocked and in sadness of what had become of her, Melanie decided to spend her life in isolation and in mourning of her late husband. Out of love for her sister, Reeta invited her sister Melanie to stay with their family looking after Reeta’s children in an attempt to get her out of mourning but till both of the twin sisters reached old age, Melanie continued her life in mourning. 

  
Early on to Melanie’s stay with her twin sister Reeta, jealousy was apparent to every one else in the family especially around Reeta’s children but out of respect to Reeta who was a good wife and a beloved mother and a caring sister, everyone else let Melanie’s jealousy pass unnoticed. Though Melanie never made her jealousy noticeable to a great extent, her mannerisms and mild outbursts and shroud comments around the household made it apparent to everyone who could connect the dots. 

  
Time passed by and at the age of 70 Melanie, the jealous sister passed away from sickness and Reeta, who was always a good sister to Melanie, mourned her sister’s death. Melanie’s cold corpse was brought after it was dressed and embalmed into the house she shared with Reeta throughout the years and put on display for a few days till her last rites were conducted for all their relatives to pay last respects as per the customs of Sri Lanka.

  
By this time, Reeta bore two children, Nick’s Mother and a son who had migrated abroad and Nick’s mother and her husband had Nick and Nick’s sister who were around 16 years old and 15 years old respectively during the period the paranormal events took place in their home.   
It is customary in Sri Lanka that a corpse is not to be left alone during the display in a house and hence during the night time when all was quiet and when all visitors had left Nick and some of his friends and neighbors to “accompany” the corpse. It was past midnight and most of Nick’s friends had fallen asleep and only a few of the neighbors were awake but barely. While Nick brushed off his tired eyes and looked at the casket his second grandma laid, he noticed that the corpse was illuminating bright colors off of the corpse’s facial area which was odd to Nick. His first impression was maybe he was hallucinating things owing to him being awake all night long but out of curiosity, Nick turned off all the lights that illuminated the open living room where the corpse was laid and to his dismay, he still saw a blue and red aura illuminating the corpse’s face. Nick was initially baffled and took a step back and went straight towards one of his good friends who was past asleep on a chair and woke him up and explained to him what he saw and both of them went towards the corpse and Nick asked whether his friend could see the aura coming off of the face of Melanie’s corpse. But the friend could not see neither a light nor any aura. 

  
The last rites for Melanie were carried out in a few days after the incident and her corpse was cremated and the twin sister Reeta wept out of sorrow for her sister and the rest of the family bore a sigh of relief knowing how jealous Melanie was about Reeta and her happy family.  
A few days passed without incident and one day Reeta suddenly took a tumble down the stairs but she was unharmed and left her with only a sore back which is a bit astonishing to her age. But suddenly all family members including Nick’s mother, father Nick and his sister all felt as if someone or something was pulling on their legs while climbing up the stairs at times. Eventually Reeta fell from the stairs for the second time and this time the injuries sustained to her back were a bit severe than previous and it led to her being bed ridden. Reeta was adamant in telling everyone that she felt something grabbing her leg and pulling at it while climbing up the stairs and that was what made her fall and everyone in the family believed her story even if no one dared to approve aloud what she stated.   
Another few days passed and Reeta’s condition was getting worse. She could not eat, drink or sleep proper. She always complained of chest pains and stated that she feels as if someone was pressing on her chest and slowly trying to suffocate her out of her breath. And one night while everyone was past asleep, Nick’s sister screamed out of horror “Its Melanie, Grandma, Grandma help…”. Nick and everyone rushed to Nick’s sister’s room as soon as they heard her screams.   
Nick’s sister who was asleep was woken up by a faint cold chill passing through her face and when she opened her eyes, she had seen a figure like Reeta, her grandmother standing at the foot of the door of her room. She had first cried out “Grandma, are you ok? What are you doing out of bed?” and when hearing the call, figure had lunged out at Nick’s sister trying to grab her throat. She had then realized that it was not her grandmother Reeta but a figure similar to Melanie, the twin sister of Reeta dressed in all whites but her face glowing in a blue and red aura similar to what Nick had observed on Melanie’s corpse and suddenly when everyone else rushed in, the figure had disappeared from Nick’s sister’s bedroom. 

  
While Nick’s mother stayed with Nick’s sister to calm her down, Nick and Nick’s father had gone to Reeta’s bedroom to check on her condition and when they entered Reeta’s bedroom, Reeta was struggling for breath putting every sap of effort left on her to breathe while trying to fend off something invisible off from her chest.  Both Nick and Nick’s father gave their maximum effort to calm Reeta down but it was apparent that Reeta was in a fight of her own with something invisible which is out to get her.  The family brought down doctors who stated that there is nothing physically wrong with Reeta and even carried out blessings both Buddhist and Catholic but Reeta showed no progress in her condition and her night terrors and attacks from the invisible entity did not seem to stop.    
A few days later, Reeta passed away. But acts of the invisible entity did not seem to stop. To be continued…………….
