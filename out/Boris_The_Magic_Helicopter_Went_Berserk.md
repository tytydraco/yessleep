"Innovations in how we film are levelling up all the time. Entertainment is the focus of our accomplishments. If the money of the entertainment industry were put into space exploration or *actually* curing diseases, we'd all be immortals on Mars right now. But keeping the masses amused is more important than advancing our species to the next level." said Thomas Ryan, CEO of VagrantMind. He was introducing Boris The Magic Helicopter, and none of us understood how the thing worked.

I just stared at it, like some kind of living cartoon character. The aircraft had a person's face on front and a blade on top and another on back. It looked derpy and whimsical.

"Say hello, Boris." Thomas Ryan told the magic helicopter.

"Hello everyone, I'm so glad to meet you all." Boris The Magic Helicopter spoke. I felt a chill, at its cartoonish voice and cheesy grin. Boris started to hover, with no need for the blades to turn. No, the blades of the helicopter looked harmless, fluffy and plush, better for a child to teethe on than for chopping the air so it could fly. Boris had no need of the blades to fly, his cartoon outline, half the size of a real helicopter, could just hover at-will, with the blades only turning slowly sometimes.

"Boris is the first of his kind, I don't want to get into technical details but yes, he is actually a living cartoon character. We have several more in design and they will be added to the roster soon after we launch." Thomas Ryan said proudly.

"Is it safe?" I asked. Everyone looked at me, and I felt like I had again misread the room. Thomas Ryan shook his head slowly and sadly at me and spoke off the mic.

"Cass, again with the worrying? Boris is meant for children. Of course he is safe. Do you have any idea how much money we are going to make off of these guys? Roland, tell Cass what we are calling them." Thomas turned and said into the mic "Roland, why don't you bring up the marquee. Our own little Doubting Cassandra needs to see it."

A flashy cartoon marquee popped into our reality from whatever cartoon dimension it was from. It was flashy and looked like it belonged with Boris The Magic Helicopter and also with all of the:

"Zoomland Friends."

I felt disturbed by the disregard for my worrying. I'm never wrong to worry. Every time I know something bad will happen it does. As I stared at Boris and his logo I felt it rising up within me, a fearful premonition. I said, in protest:

"It's supposed to be 'Doubting Thomas', Mr. Ryan. I have 'Cassandra's Curse' since nobody believes me when I say something bad will happen, even if I spell it out."

Everyone laughed and Boris began laughing too and then he started singing his theme song. I noted that the words kept referring to how he would cut the fun and chop those frowns and so on, with a lot of references to using his blades. The slowly-turning plush rotors suddenly looked menacing in some way as he kept referencing them along with making people smile or lose their heads with glee.

Thomas Ryan went to go speak with Roland, the technician, and I followed him.

"Hey, that wasn't cool. I have a job to do too." I said to his back.

"You're in charge of ensuring the safety of our product, yeah, but not when I am doing a presentation. We are way past the testing phase of the Zoomlanders. We know they are harmless."

"With us." I said.

"What's that?" Thomas Ryan turned and looked at me with some kind of pity and disgust. I felt like a turd in a punch bowl.

"We only tested them in their natural environment with us. Adults." I pointed out.

"Yes, that's right, you never saw one out in the real world like this. Must be kinda scary for someone your age." Thomas Ryan smirked.

"Mention my age one more time and we'll be having this conversation with HR." I fought back. "But you are right, age is the issue. We don't know how one of these things will react to children, and there is no safe way to find out."

Thomas Ryan started laughing at me, a loud rude laugh. "You think a cartoon character could be a danger to children? You've done this job for way too long."

"Careful." I growled, feeling hot. "I'm not signing off on these things in front of a live audience until we know more about them."

"What is there to know? They are cartoons, and we are going to be rich. Nobody wants live action anymore. So now it will be live cartoons. You really don't get it, do you? When VagrantMind goes public, when we get out of these testing facilities, we are going to dominate Disney and Sony and everyone else. It's going to be so sick!"

Somehow, I recalled that entire conversation, word for word, from the end of his speech to the moment I walked away from him. Not much of what happened in-between. Everything seemed to happen so fast after that. Thomas Ryan already had his test audience waiting, and hadn't bothered to tell me. Perhaps he had worried I'd have tried to stop him.

I would have, I think, because I was nervous and angry and I had put my foot down and told him we couldn't go any further. I replayed it all in my head, like there was something I could have picked up on or done differently. Nothing makes sense anymore.

When I found him he was about to walk out onto stage, and somehow I was standing there in the doorway, able to see the stage, able to see him and able to see the audience. I was behind everything that happened and I wasn't in the room. I don't know, maybe Boris has a blind spot.

I did nothing, I was too shocked. I just stood there.

I mean, Thomas Ryan went out there and started talking to the audience and I realized there were a couple hundred people, families, children, I mean even small children. It's so awful, I can hardly bare to recount it.

When Boris started singing it was very cringe and nobody reacted the way he wanted. They didn't smile or laugh or sing along. Thomas Ryan triggered it maybe, I don't know. He told Boris to stop singing and maybe that's why. I don't know, maybe the Zoomlanders are not good, maybe killing is just in their nature. Maybe all the songs and jokes and smiling gave us the wrong impression, to us those are amusing and friendly things. Maybe in their world those are warning signs.

Boris never really changed, he was still laughing and smiling as he flew towards the audience. Turns out his rotor blades can spin very fast and when they do they extend and are no longer all plush and stubby. Instead, they became like some kind of flying lawnmower thing going on and the audience was like an overgrown lawn, screaming in panic and pain.

Somehow those he killed splattered into confetti and colorful liquids and the parts that flew through the air became smaller Zoomlander style critters. When it was all over the theater was destroyed, the seats sliced and mangled and the walls gouged and the electric lighting sparking and smoking. There was no sign of all the families and children.

In their place were all sorts of smaller cartoon characters, split from real people. Boris The Magic Helicopter presided over them, laughing in chorus and then resuming his song. I think Roland did what happened next, as the flashing curtain to their world appeared and they all followed their butcher into whatever hell he'd come from.

When I found him (Roland), however, he had succumbed to some feeling of responsibility for the horror of what had happened. I left him there, like that, and went down below to the other survivor.

"You were right, Cass, you were right." Thomas Ryan told me.

"Don't do it." I told him. He didn't listen, instead he walked into the shimmering veil, leaving behind the dream for a nightmare.

I really hate it when I'm right.
