I've just moved into a new apartment, and I can't shake this feeling that something isn't right. The building is old and creaky, and there's this weird smell in the air that I can't quite place. But it's more than just the building itself. It's like there's something here with me, something watching me.

Last night, I woke up to the sound of scratching coming from the walls. It was like something was trying to claw its way through the plaster. When I turned on the lights, the scratching stopped, but the feeling of being watched remained.

It's getting worse. I can hear things moving around in the dark, whispering my name. And when I turn on the lights, there's nothing there. I'm scared to close my eyes, scared to let my guard down even for a second. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

I saw a figure in the hallway last night, just for a moment. It was tall and gaunt, with glowing red eyes. But when I turned on the lights, it was gone.

Emotional State: Desperate, Panicked, Paranoid

Recorded by: Neural Implant 5.0

I did some research on the building, and what I found out made my blood run cold. It turns out that it used to be a mental institution, and there were rumors of patients being mistreated and experimented on. Some even claimed that the building was haunted by the spirits of those who had died there. I don't know what to do now. I'm terrified to be in my own home.

Last night, I woke up to find my bed shaking violently. It was like something was trying to throw me off. And when I looked in the mirror, I saw a face behind me, staring back with hollow eyes and a twisted grin. But when I turned around, there was no one there.

Emotional State: Exhausted, Defeated, Resigned

Recorded by: Neural Implant 5.0

I can't take it anymore. The strange occurrences have become too much to bear. I've stopped sleeping, stopped eating. I spend all my time huddled in a corner, staring at the shadows. I'm convinced that they're closing in on me, that they're going to drag me into the darkness.

I heard a voice whispering in my ear last night, telling me to do terrible things. And when I looked in the mirror, I saw a face that wasn't mine. It was twisted and contorted, with a manic grin that sent shivers down my spine. I tried to look away, but I couldn't. It was like I was trapped, staring into the face of my own madness.

I've tried to leave the apartment, but something won't let me. Every time I reach for the doorknob, it's like an invisible force is holding me back. The walls are closing in on me, and I can barely breathe. I don't know how much longer I can last.

Last night, I woke up to find myself standing in front of the mirror, holding a knife. My hands were covered in blood, but I don't remember doing anything. I don't know what's happening to me. The voices won't stop, and the shadows won't leave me alone. I'm trapped in this nightmare, and I don't know how to escape.
