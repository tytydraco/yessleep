Audio Log 001: First Signs

[Click. The sound of a deep breath and the faint crackle of a wood stove in the background.]

“This is Nathan Cole. Log number… one, I guess. January 9th. Time is 2100 hours, give or take. Been here about a month now. Cabin’s holding up better than I thought—old as hell, but it keeps the heat in. Got snow again last night. Forest is dead quiet. Kind of eerie, but better than the noise I left behind.

No big thoughts tonight. Just… trying to make this a habit. End log.”

I didn’t start recording because I thought anything strange would happen out here. The logs were supposed to be therapy, a way to organize my thoughts after… everything. I didn’t like journaling, hated staring at the mess in my handwriting, so I bought this ancient tape recorder at a secondhand shop on the way to the cabin. The guy at the counter had laughed, told me no one used tapes anymore, but I liked the tactile feel of it. Plus, the recorder didn’t connect to the internet, didn’t buzz or beep. Just worked.

Out here, that was all I needed: silence, simplicity, and time to pull my head together.

But the first night it snowed, I started noticing things. At first, I thought I was imagining it, like my brain hadn’t adjusted to the quiet yet. But it wasn’t just my nerves.

The tracks were the first thing I couldn’t explain.

Audio Log 002: Tracks

[Click. A faint wind howls in the distance. Nathan’s voice is quieter, tense.]

“This is Nathan Cole. Log number two. January 10th. Time is 0700 hours. Snow fell heavy overnight. Woke up early to shovel the path, and… well, there’s something weird. Tracks. Big ones. Too big to be human. I don’t know what made them, but it walked upright. Bipedal. Definitely not a bear—front paws don’t land like this. I’d guess… seven, eight feet between strides.

I followed them for a bit into the treeline. They stop about fifty yards in. Just… stop, like whatever made them disappeared. Vanished. The snow is fresh. No signs of doubling back, no branches broken overhead. Nothing.”

[Pause. Nathan exhales audibly.]

“I’m not saying it’s anything crazy. Could’ve been a bear rearing up, maybe. Or a big-ass moose? I don’t know. Anyway. End log.”

The tracks circled the cabin first. That’s what unnerved me. They didn’t just pass by—they were deliberate, cutting a wide perimeter before heading off into the woods. I’d heard animals do that sometimes, especially predators, checking the area before moving on. But what animal walked like that? The claws left gouges in the snow, long and hooked, but the prints themselves were humanoid: five toes, a wide heel.

I didn’t want to be paranoid, so I chalked it up to inexperience. I wasn’t a biologist or a hunter. I didn’t know how snow distorted tracks. But that didn’t explain why the trail just ended. No signs of digging, no holes in the snow. It was like something had plucked the creature out of thin air and carried it off.

I spent the day inside after that, trying to shake the unease.

Audio Log 003: The Smell

[Click. Nathan clears his throat, his voice rougher than before.]

“Log number three. January 11th. Time is 2300 hours. Something’s wrong out here.

It’s the smell. I noticed it this morning, right after I stepped outside. Rot. Like a dead animal, but sharper, almost metallic. I checked around the property—nothing. No carcasses, no trash I’d forgotten to burn. It’s strongest near the treeline, though. I thought about following it, but… I don’t know. Feels wrong. Feels like something doesn’t want me to.

Anyway. The tracks were back tonight. Same as before—circling the cabin. I swear they’re closer this time. About thirty feet from the door. I’m not imagining that.”

[Pause. There’s a faint clinking sound, like metal against glass. A long silence follows before Nathan speaks again.]

“I boarded up the windows. Feels ridiculous, but I don’t like the idea of something watching me. I’ll check the woods tomorrow if the snow holds. End log.”

That night, I didn’t sleep. Every creak of the cabin, every gust of wind made me sit up and reach for the rifle I kept near the bed. I didn’t see anything, but the smell was worse, leaking through the cracks in the walls. It wasn’t just rot anymore—it was damp, earthy, like soil that had been turned over in a grave.

I waited until sunrise before stepping outside. The tracks were there, just like I thought, tighter around the cabin, more deliberate. I followed them to the edge of the woods, where they vanished again.

But this time, I found something else. A tuft of something snagged on a branch—a strip of flesh. It looked like skin, but pale and waxy, almost translucent. When I touched it, it crumbled between my fingers, brittle like dried leaves.

I didn’t follow the tracks any further. Something told me not to.

Audio Log 005: The Artifact

[Click. Nathan’s voice is uneven, almost whispering.]

“Log five. January 13th. Time is… I don’t know. Middle of the night. I was going to skip recording tonight, but I need to get this down. Something’s… wrong. Really wrong.

I found something by the door. It wasn’t there an hour ago. A… bone. Looks like a deer femur, but it’s been carved. There’s patterns all over it. Spirals, lines, shapes I don’t recognize. It doesn’t look old. Whatever left it wanted me to find it.”

[There’s a long pause, followed by the sound of Nathan exhaling shakily.]

“The tracks are closer again. Twenty feet, maybe less. They’re not circling anymore. They’re leading straight to my door.”
