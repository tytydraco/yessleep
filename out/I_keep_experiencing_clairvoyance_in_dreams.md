All my life, I have had somewhat strange dreams. I’m currently 15M, and I’ve been experiencing this for as long as I can remember. From the very beginning, my dreams were your average, everyday dreams that didn’t seem to make much sense. You know, the kind of dreams that are random and scattered, without much connection to real life. They were simple, no-nonsense dreams, and for a while, I didn’t think much of them. It was just like what most people describe when they talk about their dreams—nothing out of the ordinary.

Then, around the age of seven, something started to change. My dreams began to become very specific. They started to involve oddly specific situations. For example, I would find myself talking with someone in a particular way, using a very specific dialogue. Other times, I would be walking somewhere in my dream, and it felt strangely familiar. At first, I didn’t think much of it. I assumed it was just a coincidence or that my mind was creating scenarios based on things I had seen or experienced.

However, over time, I noticed something that made me question what was going on. A few years later, one of the events I dreamed about actually happened in real life. This wasn’t just a vague similarity or a déjà vu moment—it was the exact situation I had dreamed about. I realized that I had dreamed of this moment years earlier. Then, one or two years ago from today, it happened again. The events in my dreams were playing out in reality, and it wasn’t just once or twice. It started happening repeatedly.

Ever since then, I’ve had so many of these future-telling dreams that I don’t even actively pay attention to them anymore. It’s become such a common occurrence that I’ve almost grown used to it, but not completely. What makes it unsettling is that I only truly realize what’s happening once the event is already underway or has finished happening. It’s like my mind clicks, and I remember the dream in vivid detail as the situation unfolds in front of me. It’s not something I can control or prepare for—it just happens.

This experience is starting to affect me. It gives me a slight panic whenever it happens. I find myself questioning what it means and why this is happening to me. I’ve never tried to control these dreams, but I don’t even know if that’s possible. The fact that they’ve been occurring for so long and in such a consistent way makes me feel like I need help. I don’t know what to do about them or how to make sense of what’s happening.

If anyone knows anything about this, or if anyone is knowledgeable in this area, please let me know. I’m looking for answers, and I want to understand what’s going on with these dreams. They’ve been with me for most of my life, and I don’t want to feel this panic every time they happen anymore.
