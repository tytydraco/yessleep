A couple years ago, I had just gotten a Ring doorbell security camera installed. After my mom and a couple of my friends told me about it, I decided to get one myself. I mostly wanted it for the security because there were recent robberies and break-ins around my neighborhood. A man across the street had his house broken into and he only had a few things taken such as his wife's ring and some money in his wallet. Not much got taken from him since he had owned a gun and chased the robber down the street while his wife called the cops. But anyways, I bought it for the protection of myself since I wasn't like Bob and owned a gun.

One night after about a month of owning the Ring camera, I was scrolling through Reddit because I was bored and I didn't have anything exciting to do. I would have played on my PC or played on my Xbox, but it gets boring after a while and I didn't like playing the same games over and over. I was scrolling through r/nosleep until all of a sudden I got a notification...

"Motion Detected at Your Front Door!"

A Ring notification appeared so I clicked it to see what it was. Sometimes Ring cameras give a notification that there is motion at the door if a street is in view of the camera. Cars will drive by and it gives a notification. I checked and there was nothing on the camera, I thought a car must have drove by. 

I tell myself its nothing and I'm going to read a few more posts before I go to bed. About 5 minutes or so go by until another notification appears...

"Person Detected at Your Front Door!"

I once again click the notification, thinking that the software gave a false report and that a bird flew by or something made motion that made the camera think it was a person. It was not. My heart dropped to see a man staring directly at the camera. He looked like he was not just staring at the camera, but that he knew I was looking at the camera and he stared into my eyes. I can never forget his eyes. I looked out the window, trying to see if I could see the man at the camera, but I was met with a tall man who's head went over the top of the window. I jumped back and hid in my closet and called to police. A few minutes later, the officers arrived and looked and searched my house to try and find the suspects. They didn't find them. One officer, Officer Ortiz-Cisneros came up to me and said

 "I'm sorry but we couldn't find both of those men that you told us about. We are going to ask you to stay at a friends or families house while we investagate. Is that alright with you?"

"yes," I replied, "Do whatever you need to do to find them."

I am currently writing this at my friends house, I will give updates on the situation that happened two weeks ago.
