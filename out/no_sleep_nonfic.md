My once healthy friend I met that got a full ride scholarship playing university football, went from perfect health since childhood, to having no idea they may have to spend years in and out of inpatient clinics for years.

If they manage to make it after all these years of inpatient isolation, the lies from the people they trusted to be honest, and unable to do anything to cause them to get worse in their health, will be the biggest reason why they never return to society as they were. They claimed to have doctors knowingly lie to them, simply because they knew that they could after reading an output from a computer or secondary source, which gave them a legal defense AND something to point at when their morality or fault or anything is questioned.

He apparently tried to slowly kill himself for months to years after suddenly developing dozens of diagnoses within months of becoming a tissue donor. When he could have died, they kept him in the hospital for anywhere between two weeks and two years. He couldn’t have donated any tissues or organs, and he claims that is the only reason he did not die then. We never figured out how long he was in the hospital with certainty, and the family that claimed it was only a short time and “had paperwork,” was the same family that set him up with various programs designed to get him to change his entire person, who he thought he was, or sneak him into doing things he did not realize fully or was not given a moral and ethical chance at understanding. 

Our friends knew he became a hypochondriac at one point, but it wasn’t until he actually got the right help and actually got out of that mindset that things got really bad..for various reasons. 

I just had my first run in with them in person for so many years, and a lot of our mutuals had been told they did not survive the last ‘demic. Apparently, they have been fighting to survive just being the odd one out. Now, I guess trying to help them out may have been a bad move.

I gave up on them too soon, I thought. I know now I was wrong. I gave up too late, and when trying to get information, I posted in the first person when I should have posted everything as things really are, because whatever was going on with him, it has lead to my life becoming so drastically different, but so similar to his downfall, that I regret ever getting involved. Beyond having that sentiment, let me move on and explain where the start of his problems ended my life, next. The start, meaning what he could show me, and what ended up likely being why I will have dozens of parts of this story after we no longer have the chance to talk.

But its so late, I think I need to take my last dose of iodine, and charge my Kindle. I want to continue after gauging my writing style with fresh eyes.

Day Two: automod removed me

They were having difficulties. Difficulties with mental health, with money, with not being so alone in life, and less explainable(y), with their health in unexplainable ways. I tried to help, having been away from society myself for too long and coming back to science being terrifying and beyond recognition… and think I made things worse for myself (than them) by trying to help them in ways that I did not know my local government has now made it possible for me to lose my rights and never have a single clue.

with their blood doing normal blood things. At one point for x amount of time, not a single spot of blood that they saw, on several occasions, diluted to any color that it should have. Instead, it was yellow, or red and never oxidized to brown, or at a weird point I also saw, it was so dark we realized it was also not red. It dried too weirdly to really know or care. There was yellow colored fluid “bleeding” that they explained, too. They said it was blood from internal and external sources; mouth, and [urethra, reproductive organs, or other organ that can lead to vaginal opening], and various cuts/abrasions. 

They claim this started after the FDA started allowing xyz with certainty, and are trying to narrow down if it was after starting a medication containing new inactive ingredients, apparently there are several they started pre-2019 that even the name brand has a new/alternate ingredient every time they get it filled as of the end of last month, but even prior to that, most of their generics were coming from places they only ever knew to be failed research LLCs or subsidiaries of massive pharmaceutical companies that only existed because the previous patent owner was sued. I just had my first run in with them in person for so many years, and a lot of our mutuals had been told they did not survive the last ‘demic.
