For so long, I’ve felt like the only living thing there.

But I’m not.

It happens every Friday at the stroke of midnight. I slip out of our reality and into one that looks exactly the same, but there are no other people. Then, at midnight on Saturday, I slip back into the *real* world. The one full of life and sound.

The one without something lurking in the shadows.

This other place is a barren, deserted version of our world. A liminal space. It bears most manmade and natural elements of present-day Earth, but not a single other person. Not a single animal. Not even an insect.

For a long time, the Friday World’s only other signs of life seemed to be swaying trees and plants. Then again, even nature itself has always felt disingenuous in that place. It feels as if the motion of the greenery has been fabricated by something with horrid, unknown intent. Every particle of that malfunctioning universe’s matter whirs in discordance with the next. It’s a powder keg—an illusion threatening to fold into itself at any moment.

Above all else, it’s a lie. Every last bit of it.

I didn’t choose any of this. The nightmare began at midnight on Friday 8^(th) December, 2023. A shooting star of blinding blue tore through the black sky above the M5, just outside of Birmingham.

When it happened, I was cruising down the motorway on near-autopilot, surrounded by dozens of other late-night drivers matching my pace. It’s always felt like a tarmac treadmill to me—just an ocean of commuters rolling endlessly onwards, our exhausted eyes yanked ever-open by the glowing digital billboards on either side of the elevated highway.

In such a sleep-deprived state, it’s hard to trust eyes, thoughts, and reflexes.

It’s no wonder, then, that I was startled by the emergence of the sudden light in the sky. It’s also no wonder that the shock sent me veering towards the Armco barrier—several inches of steel which, whilst solid and sturdy, most likely wouldn’t have prevented my car from plummeting off the edge of the raised road and meeting a terrible end below.

I sometimes daydream about that—you know, being spared all of this horror.

Anyhow, the dazzling anomaly filled the sky with incredible blue, stealing my vision for only a second, and then it passed with a blistering trail of blue in its wake.

Once my eyesight returned, I managed to reassert control over the steering wheel, and I stopped short of colliding with the steel barrier at the edge of the first lane. However, I still chose to slam the brake when I noticed something else. Something even more terrifying than my near-death experience.

The motorway was empty.

Every other driver from my immediate vicinity had vanished. There were no cars. There were no sounds, except for the chugging of my vehicle’s running engine.

I spent the first few minutes hyperventilating as I tried to get phone service. Tried to ring someone. Anyone.

No signal.

After summoning the courage, I threw my door open and placed a tentative foot onto the tarmac below. There were no vehicles coming towards me. There was no *anything*, and that was why I’d been so hesitant to leave the safety of my driver’s seat. Still, I had to do something.

I wandered over to the second lane and spun in a full circle, eyeing the still-shining lights of Birmingham—an eerily silent city. There was no movement in any direction. Not even a distant vehicle driving along a distant road. And there was still, other than my car’s running engine, no sound.

I started to yell for help. I yelled until my vocal cords snapped and tears poured from my eyes. I wasn’t yelling at people, but at the maddening array of billboards and fully-lit buildings at either side of the elevated motorway. I wondered how a city still full of so much manmade light could be so empty.

And then, after what must’ve been ten minutes of bellowing into the night, came a reply.

It was a shrill sound, like an undulating sheet of metal against the wind. What made the piercing shriek chill my blood was that it sounded *so close* to a human scream, but it was heavily distorted. Robotic. Cold, unfeeling, and predatory. Yes, predatory. I struggled to shake that thought.

It was the sound of something on the hunt.

It sounds bizarre, given that I’d only heard a noise, but I didn’t need eyes to know what my gut was telling me.

I needed to get far away from there.

After sprinting back to my vehicle and slamming the door closed, my beating heart stilled a little. It’s funny that cars make us feel so cosy and shielded, isn’t it? It seemed as if the source of that wretched shrieking sound wouldn’t be able to touch me anymore.

Of course, I knew that wasn’t true.

Not knowing where to go or what to do, I continued driving along the motorway. Driving home. That might sound like an insane thing to do, but I felt vulnerable out on that open motorway. Smart prey doesn’t sit still.

Besides, I still had five hours of driving to do. There were miles and miles of land to cross; I think some part of me must’ve been hoping that, at some point during the journey, I’d come across another living soul. Somebody who would help me.

Instead, I discovered only a larger void of terror. More deserted villages, towns, and cities.

As I passed through residential areas, I *did* spot a few cars parked on driveways, but there wasn’t a single moving vehicle on the roads. Lights shone through the windows of many buildings, from comfy abodes to hulking skyscrapers. However, I knew that there were no people in those empty husks, so these signs of humanity made the scenery feel all-the-more haunting. The light felt deceptive and illusory—a red herring. Life was implied, but none could be found.

*What about that sound?* I reminded myself, fingers white-knuckling the steering wheel.

About two hours into driving, peculiarities began to present themselves. Peculiarities unlike that stunning shooting star. These were sights that, much like the streetlamps and kitchen lights illuminating an empty world, filled me only with a well of dread.

I emerged from the shadow of a bridge over the motorway to find that the moon had transitioned from a crescent to a full circle. I had to blink my eyes to be sure, but it had changed. I was certain of it. In any other situation, I would’ve convinced myself that I’d imagined it, but nothing about The Event made sense.

Next came an impassable junction shooting off from the motorway’s first lane. Impassable not in a worldly sense, but in the sense that the tarmac of the road simply *disappeared* beneath the roots of several trees. The road slipped, like a forgotten rug, under a thicket of woodland. It was as if nature had built over it, but I knew, even on that first night, that those proud birches were like none I’d ever seen on Earth.

I’d been toying with the possibility that the world had ended. However, such strange sightings—such askew, *glitchy* rendering of the environment—drove me to believe that something quite different had happened. Something designed.

It had something to do with that mechanical noise. That inhuman scream which, when I was about an hour away from home, I heard again. And it wasn’t so distant this time.

*It’s following me*, I realised in fear.

But I saw and heard nothing else during the rest of the drive.

I arrived home around half five in the morning. The sun still hadn’t risen, but at least most of the lights in my neighbourhood were off. That made things feel a little more natural. It gelled with the emptiness of the world.

I prayed to sleep off whatever was happening to me. I prayed that I’d wake up with a pounding headache and find that it had all been a dreadful dream.

Yet, after I woke with a groggy head in the early afternoon, I walked out of my house to find that the dead world remained.

I wandered for a good few hours, but found nothing and no-one. My phone had no signal. I couldn’t connect to the internet. The drive home hadn’t been a dream.

I spent most of the evening drinking and shuddering fearfully in my living room until passing out around ten-ish.

When I woke the second time, I was certainly groggier than the day before. In fact, I don’t think I would’ve woken *at all* if it hadn’t been for the rather loud knocking on my front door. Never before, in the midst of a hangover, had such a racket sparked joy in my heart. And when I opened the door to find a postman, I laughed tearfully.

It was Saturday, and the world had returned.

Of course, I’d lost an entire day—an entire *workday*.

*Wait, relax, you work from home on Fridays*, my bamboozled brain recalled.

Strange that I’d care about something like that after what happened. Then again, my focus on ‘normal’ thoughts may well have been a trauma response.

In fact, over the course of the following week, I half-convinced myself that I’d imagined the whole thing.

I considered that I may have actually arrived home on Thursday evening, started glugging brandy, then endured a day-long fever dream of terrifying proportions on Friday. That prevailing idea started to settle the twist in my gut, and I almost certainly would have believed it for the rest of my life.

But then next Friday came.

I woke at seven, got ready, clambered into my car, and—

*Empty roads.*

I noticed them once I’d driven out of my street, but I made it halfway to the office before fully accepting what my eyes were telling me.

It had happened again. And I was stone-cold sober. There was no denying it.

I drove back and hid in my house. This time, I didn’t drink. Didn’t really do much of anything but experience some sort of low-level panic attack for the rest of the day.

Then, at midnight on Saturday, a burst of sound—car tyres and chattering pedestrians—erupted from the world beyond my window; it tore me from my foetal position on the carpet of the living room. Life had returned. Even the walls of my lounge seemed to regain definition, as if they’d been pale imitations for the past twenty-four hours. The world was filled with overwhelming colour and noise once more.

I was supposed to meet up with some friends for a drink. I had plenty of missed calls and messages from Friday, which made me realise that you weren’t vanishing from my world—I was vanishing from *yours*.

It kept happening. Week after week. Month after month. Each Friday started to feel longer. Started to feel more like twenty-six hours. Then thirty. Of course, I was losing my grip on not only time, but my sanity; I’d lost trust in my perception of reality. My head—my whole *body*—started to ache as time went by. Existing in that alternate world of emptiness seemed to be taking its toll on me.

Then several months ago, once my routine—sitting and reading a book in the bedroom for most of each Friday—was down to a fine art, there came a disruption in my predictable schedule. A disruption that stirred me from my evening nap. It was a sound that I hadn’t heard since the very first Friday.

That metallic, half-human cry.

It was horribly familiar, though I’d only heard it once before. It’s not possible to forget a sound like that. One so painful. So bent out of shape. So relentlessly grating. It startled me right out of my reading chair and onto my feet. On less-than-eager legs, I ran to the bedroom window, then used unsteady fingers to poke a peephole through my closed curtains.

There was nothing outside. I drew the curtains farther apart, to be sure, and still found nothing.

I breathed a sigh of relief, but I knew what I’d heard. It hadn’t been my imagination. Words don’t do the sound justice—that part-mechanical, part-man sound.

And then, as my fingers gripped the drapes to pull them shut, I screamed.

A shape poked up from beyond the bottom of the window.

Something was on my front lawn.

I found myself staring at the receding hairline of a man’s head—a head nearly as wide as the window itself. And as he rose to his feet, horribly slowly, the man revealed himself to be a forty-feet-tall giant with stretched proportions, as if he’d been elasticated on a medieval rack. The nude creature bore ghostly-white, dehydrated skin, covered in stretch-marks that seemed to be *tearing*, and bloodshot eyes that sat at marginally different heights on his elongated face.

The figure looked, to my eyes, as if he had once been human.

Once he had stood to a full height, revealing the lower section of his abdomen, the man slammed two slender hands against the window pane. Misshapen hands so large that they covered the entirety of the glass. The fright of the motion and sound sent me tumbling, mouth agape and wailing in horror, onto the bed.

The pale palm of that abomination kept smacking in a clear attempt to break the window.

I scrambled to my feet, then sprinted into the upstairs hallway moments before the glass pane shattered. And when I spun on the upstairs landing, I saw that the tall man had squatted down again, and it was squeezing through the shattered window pane—painfully, given his deformed, tinny screams.

The giant was crawling into the second floor of my home.

I cried as the thing struggled to fit its mammoth skull into my bedroom, but I didn’t linger for more than a second. I sprinted down to the entryway, flung the front door open, and beelined towards my car.

Once I’d slipped into the driver’s seat, feeling deceptively safe in that flimsy box, I looked up at the tall thing lifting its feet off the grass as its torso wriggled through my upstairs window. And as I looked, it paused. Paused, then started to reverse.

The thing had clearly realised where I’d gone.

As I reversed off the driveway, tyres burning against the gravel, I felt more than a churn in my gut. I felt the migraine that had been worsening over the past couple of months. As I drove down the street, I noticed that the spot behind my eyes throbbed more painfully than ever before. But I decided that the migraine had been compounded, perhaps, by my fear of the tall man.

The tall man who was climbing back out of my bedroom window.

It was spreading through my body. This ache. This unimaginable ache. Such a distracting agony that I only noticed the thumps of titanic footsteps a second before something scratched against the bumper of my car.

I looked at my rear-view mirror to see that the gaunt, unclothed giant had fallen flat on its long, disproportioned stomach in an attempt to clutch at my vehicle. With a primal screech, I stepped more firmly on the accelerator, and then I left my town behind—left that *thing* behind.

I drove until I ran out of petrol. I made it to Carlisle, as a matter of fact, and I hid in an empty Travelodge’s reception area. From my quivering spot on one of the sofas, I listened to the far-off shrieks of something large and unrelenting—shrieks that, as the hours ticked by, became not-so-far-off.

Around eleven, that metallic roar was followed by the sound of metallic *crumpling* and an almighty thud—then a car alarm of some obstacle that had been in the creature’s way. My wet eyes enlarged at the blinking white lights which painted the awning outside the hotel’s entrance.

He was close.

Throughout that final hour, I counted the minutes—counted the seconds.

And then it came. Not the sight of that beast smashing through the hotel’s glass doors, but a rush of sound and motion. A blur swept through the lobby, distorting all colours for moment, then I found myself in a room no longer empty. Midnight had arrived, along with a hotel receptionist behind the front desk. He was frowning at me, unsurprisingly, given that I had spontaneously appeared out of thin air.

“Where did you…” the late-night worker began, before rubbing his eyes. “Erm, never mind… Do you need a room, sir?”

I shook my head whilst clambering up from the sofa, then I hurried outside and walked to a local petrol station.

As I walked through the lairy streets of Carlisle at midnight, I thought about my situation. Eventually, my eyes stopped resisting the urge, and I timidly looked at my aching body below.

I nearly choked on my own breath. There was no explaining it.

My legs.

My arms.

All of my extremities, in fact.

They all looked three or four inches longer than the day before.

And I’d known that since the stroke of midnight. I’d already felt the change in my body. I just hadn’t accepted it for the first half an hour or so, as adrenaline had been jumbling my thoughts. Adrenaline from the horror of being stalked by that thing.

Now, of course, there are greater horrors swirling in my mind—horrifying *questions*.

Was that giant once a man like me?
