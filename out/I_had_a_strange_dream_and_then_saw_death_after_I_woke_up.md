I remember around middle school, a good friend of mine wanted to have a sleepover at my house. I was really excited seeing my colleague coming into my house as I didn't have many friends during middle school and eventually high school come to my house.  The friends I did bring to my house had mixed reaction as I was still pretty much a bit of a jackass back then, I've grown as a person through therapy so I'm a lot more willing to open about myself.

Anyways back to the story, while me and my friend were in my room just hanging out such as playing Super Smash Bros Melee and TY The Tasmania Tiger 2 Bush Rescue Rangers on the GameCube my friend and I got pretty exhausted and we decided to go bed. I got prepared for bed, brushing my teeth with the usage of an automatic floss machine which stores water creating a hydro-pump perfect for getting food particles off as I still had braces at the time.  Once I got my teeth cleaned my friend was already fast asleep with the lights still on, which I find still hilarious since they were  staring directly into the lightbulb with their eyes closed. So I turned off the light and went straight to bed.

I closed my eyes drifting into a dream were I was in a room full of these five doors, I can't recall what happens next within the dream but I remember seeing a figure that looked similar to a primate. Specifically a chimpanzee as the stance was upright but it was extremely tall, but the primate just stood there looking at me. I might of picked a door to see the primate in the first place, but again, my memory of the dream I had is vague.  The last I recall from the dream was the chimp running towards me before I heard a loud boom similar to a lighting strike.

I woke up, sweating and breathing heavily as I felt my heart beating rapidly and entire body shaking. I heard my friend snoring loudly and high winds meaning that a storm was hitting my area, it explained the loud boom coming from my dream was outside. My body wasn't moving, lying straight toward the ceiling though I could still move my neck. However, when I moved my neck down and to the left I saw a figure standing there looking directly at me. The figure stood with a black cloak with glowing red eyes having a large scythe and its entire face being a skull form. This my friend was death staring straight at me while I was having a sleepover.

The figure stood there for about I say a couple seconds before I blinked and the figure disappeared. I was fully awake and able to move my entire body.  I was shaken, afraid, so I looked at my friend who was heavily sleeping and decided to wake them up. I told them about death, (the figure in the room) looking  at me and my friend thought I was crazy or pulling a prank on them. Eventually, my companion just went back to bed while I stood there wondering if I was just having a sleep paralysis.  However, I remember when I headed back to my bed I thought I heard a small whisper that resembled cold air brushing through my ears. The whisper stated:

"YOU SHALL PERISH ONE DAY WITHOUT KNOWING"

I looked around the bedroom to see who was speaking to me, nothing, there was no person nor figure not even my friend was talking to me, they were fast asleep and started snoring. I crawled back to bed still looking around to see if death returned for me, but there was nothing in my room. I closed my eyes and then there was nothing, however, I heard one finale whisper that said

"REST NOW BUT YOU WILL BE ALONE SOON"

The next morning, I told my parents about what I saw last night but they didn't believe me thinking that I was having a sleep paralysis. The thing is.................. I still remember them being there and now I sometimes that voice and those glowing red eyes. Sometimes, I still see them during a stormy night and sometimes even during the day.
