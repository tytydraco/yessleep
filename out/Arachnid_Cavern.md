The situation started in an unusual way and evolved from there. I was asked to help out a dear friend with a delicate family issue. She sheepishly admitted she needed my assistance cleaning out her grandmother’s home. With undeserved embarrassment, she confessed that she was a ‘hoarder’. 

I’d watched the shows. The range of those cleanup projects runs from slightly cluttered, to fully impassable and hideous. I wasn’t sure how bad her grandmother’s place was inside, but none of that bore any effect on how I felt about my friend herself or her family. Her reluctance to ask for my help was unnecessary. Friends help out their friends. 

I met her at the location for an initial walkthrough to access what we would need for the cleanup. I’ll admit, it was pretty bad but I’m not afraid to suit up in protective gear and get things done. With her, myself, and her brother tacking the project one room at a time, you could see the progress as we made it. Starting in the garage, we sifted through thigh-deep piles of clothing, assorted boxes, unopened items from a discount clearance store, and thousands of other miscellaneous things. 

I suggested we spray our clothes with insect repellent and wrap our pants legs and sleeves with duct tape to prevent being bitten by any creepy-crawlies we encountered, but none of us has any idea what we were getting into. The black widow spiders stood out because they have a distinctive look. I was much more worried about brown recluses. They aren’t easy to spot and offer a far-worse bite. 

Obviously there were many other undesirable creatures inside the piles of things. We wore gloves and face masks but there were small gaps occasionally between our long sleeve shirts or protective clothing. Rodent droppings, random webs, silverfish, and untold insects were everywhere. In all, we witnessed dozens of black widows and unidentified egg sacks. It made us hesitant to even reach into dark corners or to pick up items to discard, but we had a job to do. 

After finishing up for the afternoon, I bade my fellow cleanup workers adieu and drove home in haste. The whole time, I envisioned the glory of the hot water from my shower blasting away the gross, filthy residue off my skin and grimy body. I disrobed, tossed my grungy clothes and hat in the washing machine, and stepped in to finally ‘decontaminate’. 

It felt so good to wash all that away. I stepped out and dried off. In my mind, I was clean again and free of anything lurking in that garage. My clothes had been washed, and so had my external body. I felt relaxed and fantastic, until a pervasive tingling inside my left ear erased that fleeting feeling of calm. After that, I could focus on nothing else. I cursed myself for driving home while wearing my work hat and coat. In the morbid theater of my mind, I imagined what must’ve happened.

The random, fluttering ‘tickle’ inside my ear canal demanded I address it immediately; and to the inclusion of all else. My probing index finger would involuntarily explore the fleshy folds of my external ear, hoping to discover and extricate a gnat, or beetle, or flea. ANYTHING but a harry little spider; but no matter how often or faithfully I addressed the uncomfortable sensation plaguing me, I could find no relief. It persisted, while my fear and paranoia grew. 

As unpleasant as it was to consider, if there was a spider of any breed hiding in my ear canal, I didn’t want to cause it to retreat deeper inside my head, to evade my attempts to remove it. I also didn’t want to kill it and leave parts of its smushed body in me. As grotesque as that idea might be, the thought of a foreign eight-legged menace nesting in my head pressed me to push past my queasiness to ‘evict the unwanted tenant’.

A cotton swab was delicately worked into my ear canal. Understandably, urgency precipitated a balance between ‘safe’, and: “My god! There’s a freaking spider crawling around in my damn ear!” The shaft of the swab was straight. The canal was not. It failed to strike pay-dirt. At times I would feel distinctive movement. It was enough to make a person want to faint or scream in full-blown heebie-jeebies. Other times there would be nothing whatsoever to indicate the likelihood of a foreign organism living inside my ear, like an arachnid cavern. 

I wanted to believe it was in my imagination. I really did but the horrific tingling sensation was too frequent to ignore. I didn’t have any ear drops and was too frantic and distracted to drive. For the longest time, I couldn’t even bring myself to call someone for help because I’d have to say the words. In my fragile state, I deluded myself into thinking if I didn’t articulate the terrifying truth, it wouldn’t be real. 

Just when I’d finally calm down and my heart would quit racing, the incessant itch would start back up again! To make matters worse, my sadistic imagination conjured up the dreadful idea that an egg sac inside me would soon rupture and hundreds of tiny offspring would spring out! I wanted to violently jam a butcher knife directly into my ear and gouge it out, but I had to remain rational and hope for the best. It was unimaginable torture.

Finally, I’d had enough. I called a neighbor for help but asked that I be allowed to avoid explaining why I needed emergency medical attention. They were obviously curious but to their credit, they honored my request and drove me to the ER in discreet silence. The ride was uncomfortable but honestly, nothing comes to mind as being worse than having a living spider recused in my ear canal. 

Was it a Black Widow? A Recluse? An ordinary ‘harmless’ spider? At that point I obviously didn’t care. I just wanted it out, as every one of you would. They flushed out my ear canal with a special wash station and extracted my personal eight-legged tormentor. As a precaution, the doctor ran a scope down into my ear to look for bite marks, egg sacs, and body parts that failed to be flushed out. Having the scope down there just triggered me again but it had to be done. Then they wrote a prescription for antibiotics and discharged me.

Has reading this testament of terror made your ears tingle or itch? Maybe you felt something crawling on you. Arachnids are never more than six feet away at any time from us. That’s true. Maybe they are even closer, right now. Perhaps they are curious about the tiny little holes on the side of your head and wonder about investigating them. Goodnight.
