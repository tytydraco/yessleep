The urban legend about Pellington, NY- now Tivoli- originated during the newspaper boom in the early 1700s.  A traveling *New York Times* reporter wrote a review for a restaurant he patronized during a trip along the Hudson.

At the time it wasn’t a town or village, but an abandoned farmhouse and barn converted into a bed & breakfast along the Northeast Passage.  The American Train lines hadn’t completed construction yet, making the only way to get there was by horse & carriage, or by boat, but that was more dangerous.  The only family that lived there was the Pellington family.

The restaurant, *Kitchen Closes at Midnight,* is the centerpiece of the story.  Its a misnomer however, the restaurant didn't close; it was a 24-hour establishment for wayward travelers; rooms with beds were in the barn behind the restaurant.

After the article went to print, soon rich Manhattanites were visiting the restaurant, the late-night menu garnered a reputation among chefs in the city who were eager to see these recipes.

Business thrived, so the restaurant altered its menu to better suit the new customers coming from NYC; its normal fare ended at midnight, then switched to fancier, exotic French cuisine, served by candlelight with a live string quartet performing.  One illustration exists of the interior, you can tell the restaurant was fancy for its time.  This is described in the NY Times article. 

Pellington expanded to include a horse stable, a woodworking/metallurgist shop, a jewelry & high-end clothing store and a packaged goods market.  The Pellington family enjoyed years of prosperity, but it didn’t last.

The tragic disappearance of the Rothskilds- a wealthy family from NYC- changed that.  The Roskilds were well-known watchmakers.  Today their watches are rare.

By the time the authorities arrived at the Pellington location, the Pellington family had fled, never to be seen again. 

There is a chapter in a book about urban legends on Pellington; the author mistakenly called them the Wellingtons, but the details line up. 

The original NY Times review is below, the urban legend chapter “Wellington Horror” is beneath that.

*New York Times - 5/6/1721*

*OLD FARMHOUSE TURNED SUPERB LATE-NIGHT RESTAURANT*

*I was traveling back to Manhattan along the Hudson River, it was evening, our coachman spotted a dimly lit structure near the river.  It was a small restaurant, “Kitchen Closes at Midnight”.  We were weary from travel, so we entered and were seated right away.  They had sleeping rooms in the barn behind the restaurant; we reserved one for my partner and I, one for our coachman.*

*The waiter guided us to our table, their ‘late-night’ menu had French entrees I didn’t recognize:*

·      *Visage en cuir au jois*

·      *Sandwichs aux doigts de concombre*

·      *Estomac avec du fromage et du jambon*

·      *Viande de bœuf avec du romarin et du safran*

·      *Visage rôti avec des navets et bras salé*

*Except for ‘jambon’- ham- so my partner and I ordered two entrees and a bottle of cabernet.*

*The food was marvelous- the textures, the presentation- simply the best meal I’ve had during this trip.  You simply must visit this restaurant; exquisite.*

*Afterwards we enjoyed a string quartet performing Chopin, sipping wine and admiring the interior.  All variety of brass furnishings from Europe reflected the candlelight, making for an intimate, unforgettable evening.  The kitchen itself was hidden discreetly behind red drapes.  It didn’t feel like we were in any mere restaurant, it felt like we transported to a wholly magical place.*

*We slept soundly in our bunks until dawn, then proceeded with our trip, thanking the owners before departing.*

*Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Pellington, I plan to visit your establishment again.*

*Chapter 7 – “The Wellington Horror”*

*In a town called Wellington, NY, existed a renovated farm turned into a bed & breakfast in the early 1700s by a family known as the Wellingtons.* 

*Their once prosperous business disintegrated after a wealthy family of watchmakers from New York- the Roskilds- traveled to Wellington’s restaurant, a highly rated, but remote restaurant along the Hudson River for a late-night dinner.*

*The Roskilds never returned home, prompting an investigation by the police.  What was discovered at the site was pure horror.  Human remains were found buried in a mass grave, mostly skeletons.  Some that were not completely decomposed were hanging from meathooks in the kitchen, sliced up like cattle.  Wild horses roamed the property and the items that remained in the shop were connected to other missing persons- although not as well-known as the Roskilds- these people were never identified publicly.*

*A letter was delivered to the Boston Globe years later from an anonymous source; the editors were not convinced it was true, or appropriate to print due to the content, so instead a weekly paper published it to attract more readers.*

*--*

*To Whom it May Concern,*

*I know what happened to the Roskild family, it is much worse than the police have concluded as motive- the Roskild’s didn’t vanish because of their wealth.*

*I worked for the Wellingtons when they first settled here.  After the NY Times article was published, their business expanded and they asked me to work in the stable.  I never entered the restaurant, the smell from the kitchen was strange, gamey.  Their free meals made me ill.*

*I recognized the horses and carriages that were accumulating; other people would come by and take them.  I realized whoever entered the restaurant never left.  Their belongings were sold in the store, the horses sold off or traded.  I told the Wellingtons I found another job and quit.  As a parting gift they gave me a Roskild watch.  I recognized it as the same one Sir Roskild wore; it was a big event for us country folk to see such wealth.  I still have the watch, but I don’t wear it, it’s still on Sir Roskild’s wrist.*

There’s more in that letter, but it makes me ill to read it.
