This is a true story. We were staying in this fancy hotel for my cousin’s wedding. I was twelve. I woke up to a rough shove, assuming that my sister was waking me up. It was early morning, about 7:30. I groggily stepped out of the bed and was hit with hairspray fumes. I heard the sound of someone taking a shower, as well as loud hurried footsteps and repetitive spritzes of the hairspray can.

I walked to the dresser and pulled out a blouse and a skirt. As I got dressed, I heard knocking on my door. I pulled my top fully on and opened the door. There was no one there. I was kind of freaked out right now, but I knew that it must be my imagination, as I was about half asleep at the time. I exited the bedroom. I heard the shower shut off as I passed the lavatory, then my father’s heavy footsteps.

At the end of the hall, there was another restroom. I heard repetitive spritzes coming from there and called to my mother. “Hey, mom, I need to pee, and dad’s in the other bathroom!” I heard my mother’s voice: “Alrighty!” It was definitely her voice, but “Alrighty” was not something she had ever said. I rolled my eyes and walked away. I figured that I should wake my granddad, as I heard heavy snores coming from the room that he was sharing with my parents.

I wondered why my parents hadn’t woken him up. When I opened the door, I was scared to see that the room was empty. Just then, the noises and the smell of hairspray stopped. I ran downstairs and saw that my roommates (dad, mom, granddad, Clarissa) were already eating breakfast. I checked my watch and saw that it was already 10:00. My mom stared at me. “Wha-?” I thought. My sister then said, “What the heck?” I asked them what was wrong.

My sister then said, “You literally just went to the bathroom.” and pointed to the lavatory next to the small kitchen area. I walked over there and pressed my ear to the door. Sure enough, someone was there, washing their hands. I shook it off and counted my fingers. Ten of them. I wasn’t dreaming. I knocked on the door, and inside the bathroom, I heard my own voice, calling out, “Alrighty!” I looked over at my parents, sister, and granddad, who were all pale.

Behind my back, I heard the lock click, followed by my own voice saying, “Hey there, Sara!” and footsteps. I turned around just in time to see my own feet, dressed in my black velvet flats, turning the corner on the staircase. I felt paralyzed with fear, and goosebumps crept up my back. I wasn’t able to move for about a minute before I told my family all about what had happened a few moments ago. My sister told me that yesterday, when she woke up, I wasn’t in my bed.

But she heard noises coming from the bathroom. When she went there, she saw me walking down the hall in my pajamas and called out to me, but I kept walking. When she went back to my room, I was still sleeping in my bed. She freaked out and didn’t tell anyone. Fast forward to two years later. My cousin now has a six-month-old baby, and we’re talking to each other over tea. I told my cousin about what happened to me and my sister, and she froze.

“That happened to you too?” She said. I felt the goosebumps return to my arms and legs. She then told me that she had woken up and walked downstairs when she saw her fiancée (now husband) sitting at the table, eating cereal. He greeted her, then said that he was going to get something from upstairs. It took him some time. Eventually, she felt sort of concerned and went to check on him. He was asleep, still in his pajamas.
