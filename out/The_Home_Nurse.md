I hadn’t seen Uncle Martin in over a decade. The family said he went “soft in the head” after he bought that geriatric care facility up north. They said he stopped calling. That he let the place rot. 

Still, he left the entire estate to me when he died.

That included Grey Pines Elder Care, a now-defunct building on the edge of a foggy patch of nowhere. The paperwork called it “condemned.” The town called it bad luck.

I was going to sell it. Demolish it.

But I wanted to see it first.

Just once.

On my first visit, Grey Pines still stands—barely.

The parking lot is cracked, and weeds are taller than the old reception desk. But when I opened the front doors, I was hit with warm, dry air. The power was on.

And there was… noise.

Soft. Faint.

A television playing a game show.

Somewhere down the west wing.

Except that’s impossible. The building’s been shut for eight years.

In the nurse's station, I found a box labeled “INCIDENT — DO NOT DESTROY.”

Inside were several VHS tapes. One caught my eye:

 “Room 6 — July 6, 2017”

I watched it on the facility’s old playback system.

The camera was pointed at a bed. An elderly woman—thin, almost skeletal—was strapped down at the wrists and ankles.

She whispered something, over and over:



“She has no name, but she takes yours.”

“Don’t speak to her. Don’t hear her voice.”

“She leaves the door open.”



At exactly 3:33 AM, the lights flickered.

The woman sat bolt upright.

And screamed.

The screen cut to black.

Room 6 is always locked. The doorframe is warped, and someone nailed planks across it. Written on the door in red ink:

"DO NOT UNSEAL. SHE WAITS."

I asked the town clerk for records. He said Room 6 was where they “held the hospice cases,” those in the final days. The long-goodbyes. The ones that lingered.

He also said no one made it more than 7 nights in that room—not the nurses, not the patients.

One nurse, Abigail Horne, went missing entirely. No signs of forced entry. Just her ID badge… and a note scrawled in her handwriting:

“I am still here. But not in the same way.”

  
Behind a loose wall tile in the basement, I found a leather-bound book. Not medical records—confessions. Written by Uncle Martin.

 “I thought she was just a patient. But she never aged. Never ate. Never blinked.” 

“The other residents stopped sleeping. Said she walked the halls at night, humming.”

“Then the deaths began. Peaceful at first. Then violent.”

“She wore the faces of the nurses. Called them by name. Begged for help. But her eyes were empty.”

“I sealed Room 6. But she still talks to me.”

“She says I have to find someone else. Someone with my blood.”

“God forgive me.”

The power surged at 3:30 AM. I was reviewing the tapes when I heard it:

Humming.

Just outside the nurse’s station.

It was faint at first, but familiar.

A melody I hadn’t heard in years.

My mother used to sing it.

And she died when I was six.

The humming moved through the hallway, slow and steady.

I turned off the monitor. But the screen didn’t turn black.

Instead, it showed Room 6, in real time. The door—once nailed shut—was now wide open.

Inside was a figure in a nurse’s uniform. Her back turned.

She stopped humming. Slowly turned.

And smiled at the camera.

She was wearing my mother’s face.

  
Grey Pines remains closed. No trespassers reported since the death of Nicholas Horne. Cause of death: undetermined. Found in Room 6, eyes missing, wrists bound, smile carved into cheeks.”

 TV was still playing when he was found. A nurse was on screen, staring into the lens. She said, “Welcome back, Mr. Horne. We’ve missed you.”

Room 6 sealed again. Until someone else in the Horne line takes the inheritance.
