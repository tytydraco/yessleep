It happened in third period. 

Xavier, one of the quieter kids in my class, came up to me with a clenched fist and a hand over his mouth.

“Mithter Thtanley?” He sputtered out a muffled cry into his palm and held his closed fist up to me.

“What’s up?” 

He unfurled his fist, revealing four bloody teeth in his palm.

“I think I need thuh go thoo the nurth.” 

He uncovered his mouth. His front teeth were missing, along with his bottom ones. The lines between his teeth were filled with dark red.

“Oh my God.”

I cringed at the sight.

“Go to the nurse Xavier, take my tissues.” I told him.

I had encountered a few kids having a tooth fall out when I taught second grade. This was my first year teaching high school. Kids shouldn’t be losing teeth unless they were getting into fights.

Right as I handed him the hallpass, Jayla yelled from across the class, exclaiming that her back tooth came out. 

Then it was Albert. Then Anthony. Then Megan. Then Sam.

Until the whole class was losing teeth. They cried, but kept wiggling at their teeth. Tiny little taps rung out on each students desk. 

I passed my storage of Kleenex boxes around the class, making sure each kid got a few.

I tried calling the nurse, but she didn’t pick up.

I walked to the front of the class and announced, “Everyone stay in here, I’m gonna go get the nurse, I’ll be back soon.”

It seemed like all the other teachers had the same idea. Teachers crowded around in the nurse’s empty office, asking about where the nurse went, others conversing about what happened in their classrooms. Everyone’s story was the same. It started with one student, then the rest started losing them.

I felt around in my mouth with my tongue, checking each tooth’s sturdiness. Strong as ever.

The nurse walked back into the office.

“I talked to the principal, he’s going to make an announcement immediately, we’ve already called 911.”

The news arrived shortly after the ambulances. Helicopters showed up too. Care flight I think. Men in big white rubber suits closed off the area. Some of them had weird looking gadgets. 

Over the next couple hours, hundreds of kids with gauze stuffed mouths were sent home. Cameras were shoved in the principal’s face. Some in mine too. They all asked the same questions.

“How many students have been affected?”

“Do you think this could be biological warfare? Biological terrorism? Chemical runoff in the water system?”

“Are any of the teachers experiencing what the students have?”

I felt like a deer in the headlights.

I was just a teacher. A confused, scared teacher. 

I got home at about nine. My wife Mona greeted me at the front door with a hug.

“I heard about school today.” She stepped back and examined me. “Are you okay?” 

“Yeah.”

I didn’t want to lie, but it was the easiest option.

I couldn’t sleep that night. That sound of falling teeth clacking on the desks haunted me.

School was cancelled for the next two weeks.

Everyone was talking about it online. 

Article after article about why and how this could’ve happened.

A town meeting was held a day later. As soon as the superintendent walked on stage, the crowd murmured.

A mother in the back screamed, “My son’s in the hospital! Are you gonna pay for those bills?”

This started a chain of furious parents yelling, asking what we would do for their kids. 

The superintendent was walked off stage, quickly replaced by a public health official.

“At this time, we are actively investigating what caused this spontaneous phenomenon. We’re trying our hardest to get you the answers you deserve.”

He was met with loud disapproval from the parents.

As I left the meeting, I saw one of my students with his parents. 

It was Xavier. 

When he spotted me, he looked away immediately, as if he was ashamed that I saw him.

I felt horrible for the kid.

That night, when I got home and settled into bed, my mind began to wander into all the possibilities. 

One question ran through my mind though.

Why only the students?

As I drifted off to sleep, I was jolted awake by a single loud knock on my front door.
I stared at Mona. She was fast asleep.

When I opened the door, a brown paper bag laid on my porch. Red tissue paper stuffed inside. 

A gift from the community,

I thought as I lifted the bag. It was heavier than I expected, and it sounded like a Lego box being shaken around. 

I placed it on my table, and it let out a slunk, like a bean bag being dropped on the ground. I rubbed my eyes, and decided I’d open it tomorrow. 

The next morning I was awoken by the sound of my wife getting ready for work. I rubbed my eyes and sat up against the headboard.

“What did you get your class?” Mona asked, in my half awake daze, this question confused me.

“What are you taking about?”

“The bag on the table, it says ‘Mr. Stanley’s Classroom’ on it.” She replied.

I got out of bed and walked to the table. Turning the bag around revealed some words I hadn’t the night before.

As clear as day, it read ‘Mr. Stanley’s Classroom’ in sharpie, with a little smiley face at the bottom.

When I pulled the top layer of tissue paper out of the bag, something went flying out, tapping repeatedly on the hardwood floor. 

I got on my knees and scanned the floor. I spotted it against the white of the baseboards. I picked it up and examined it closer. A brown tooth.

It bounced on the ground as I dropped it, running to yanking the top layer of tissue paper off. 

Discolored teeth crowded the inside, pushing the walls of the bag.

Every teacher in the school received a paper brown bag that night.

The teachers with Ring doorbells revealed someone dropping these bags off. The man had on a long black trenchcoat and sported a bowler hat. His face was covered with sunglasses and white cloth wrapping, like that old Invisible Man movie.

The media dubbed him the ‘Tooth Fairy’. It wasn’t long until statewide search for this man was held.

The district was in outcry.

No abnormalities were found in the children’s bodies, but the news still spun the story that this Tooth Fairy might’ve drugged the kids, or somehow used radiation to make them lose their teeth. How he got them from the classrooms, no one knows. None of the cameras in the school caught him in the halls.

My mom texted me, and sent me the link of me on the news.

“Look at you! Hollywood star. Crazy stuff! Stay safe. Love you! -Mom”

I don’t think she really understood the magnitude of what happened, but at least she thinks I’m famous. I clicked on the video, and as soon as I did, there he was. 

Black trenchcoat, sunglasses, white face wrapping.

As I spoke, stuttering on live news like the idiot I am, he was in the back, helping a young girl replace gauze in her mouth.

I showed this to the authorities. There were no records he was at the school. No EMS personnel saw him. No news outlets interviewed him. The only trace of him was through video. 

The police interviewed the girl that the Tooth Fairy was helping. Her name was Sarah.

Sarah told the police that he just walked up to her and started helping with her gauze. He didn’t speak to her, but whispered quietly under his breath as he replaced her gauze. She said it was strange because he kept the used gauze and stuffed it into his pocket. Then he walked off, and started helping another kid.

The police interviewed every kid at the school. They were all helped by this man.

A few weeks later and the search for the Tooth Fairy died down. Kids started to get full mouth implants. Things started to get better.

The town held a night of recognition for the students. Every kid showed up. I saw some sporting a whole new set of pearly whites.

They let a few kids speak about the events of that day, and how they got over their pain and overcame the horror.

To my surprise, one of them was Xavier. When it was his turn to speak, he held the mic to his mouth, and covered the bottom of his face with the other.

Before he could speak, someone in the audience stood up. I was in the very back, so I couldn’t see exactly who it was, but I recognized the silhouette from anywhere.

He walked down the center aisle until he reached the apron of the stage. He stared up at Xavier, and lifted his open hand up towards him, gesturing to give him the microphone. Xavier obliged, and the man held it up to his covered face. He whispered something. His hushed voice filled the auditorium. I couldn’t tell what he said, but the look on Xavier’s face told me what intent those words held.

Xavier fell to his knees, grabbing at his face. He crawled to the edge of the stage, and what seemed like black tar oozed from his mouth onto the floor.

He let out a bloodcurdling scream. Some people in the front row ran to help him, and so did I. 

As I ran down the aisle to aid Xavier, I noticed the rest of the kids in the auditorium were struggling as well. Every kid was grabbing at their mouths and crying. 

It wasn’t until I got to Xavier that I realized why. 

His teeth were growing back. 

Horrible jagged thorns ruptured out from his gums. I looked around. All of the kid’s mouths were now filled with a pink inflamed mess and crooked white razors. 

I just stood there in shock, and ran out of the auditorium. 

I heard more screams from behind the closed doors. These weren’t pain. It was confusion. Desperation. Parents yelling out for their kids.

They closed down the school after that night. 

No one knew where they went. 

We looked for months. Hell, the whole country looked.

We didn’t know how to grieve on such a scale. Two hundred and ninety kids missing. 

The Tooth Fairy’s pictures and videos were spread everywhere. I saw him online every day for weeks. 

People in town made up stories Possession. A mass Pagan ritual planned by the students. Some said the devil got them. The missing children’s posters were rapidly covered with the faces missing pets.

I stayed put. My wife had such a great job in town, and I couldn’t take that away from her. 

I think it was good that we stayed. If it meant it would get us even an inch closer to finding those kids, I’d spend every waking minute looking. When the search parties waned, I persisted. I’d go in the morning with a bag of food and my flashlight, hoping we could find even one of them.

The town forced itself to move on. The high school had to open back up for the incoming freshman at the middle school. I started seeing parents in public again. They’d shoot me a wave and a smile, and I’d reply back with the same.

The town was healing.

It was.

I say that because last night, my molars fell out. Then my canines. Then my front teeth. I called 911, but no one answered.

Every line was busy.

It seemed like all the other teachers had the same idea.
