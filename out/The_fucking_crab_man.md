I had an encounter that left me shaken, and I’m not sure where else I can post this without being laughed at. Even here, most of y’all won’t believe this, but if even one person gets the message, I will have done my part. If there’s one thing you take away from this story, let it be this: stay the fuck away from the beach.



This December has been warm, even for Texas. With temperatures getting all the way up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, it certainly hasn’t felt like Christmas. Despite this, we have had one or two nice little cold fronts; just this weekend we had a few nights get near freezing. You would think that this is a terrible time to go to the beach, and you would be correct. Once the water temperature starts getting into the low 70s and below, folks usually stop coming out to Galveston for the season. This is the time of the year that I most enjoy taking walks on the beach. Hooded sweatshirt with a windbreaker on top, and no one around to disturb me.



Like I said, this weekend was particularly chilly for us Texans: 60 degrees during the day feels like freezing to us, especially down by the water. This worked out just fine for me, as I was the only one out there during my walk, despite it being the middle of the day. I bundled up as best I could with my limited wardrobe and carried a Thermos of hot coffee along with me. It was a fine winter day on the island: clear blue skies, light wind coming off the water. The roar of the surf was the only music I needed. Y’all may know that the beach down here isn’t the prettiest in the world—the water is brown with mud, and there’s usually a good bit of trash—but it does have its own appeal. Being from Houston, it’s good enough just to get a taste of the natural world for a change.



As I continued down the beach, I saw a ghost crab running across the sand ahead of me. It is unusual to see one in the daytime, especially in the colder months when they usually hibernate, so I stopped to watch. When he reached the edge up where the beach turns into a grassy dune, he burrowed down beneath the sand. Amused, I hiked up towards where he dug. To my surprise, two more crabs scurried in from different parts of the beach. They both ran up directly in front of me and dug in, right on top of where the first crab had buried himself.



Unnerved, I stood in silence, wondering what would cause three different crabs to not only come out during a winter day, but all retreat into the same hole. After a moment of nothing else happening, I started to move on, turning back towards the water. I began to walk, then froze. Hundreds of crabs scurried towards me like a wave. I stumbled backwards and fell, stifling a scream as the mass scrambled over my body, covering me in a blanket of shell and claw. When they had all passed, I looked behind to see where they were going. As I thought, they were all descending on the same hole that the first three had dug into, the sand churning and shifting like water as they all siphoned into the burrow.



When it was done, I lay where I had fallen in shock. Before I could recover, the sand started moving again. My mouth dropped in horror, and I couldn’t even blink as before my eyes, a creature emerged from the dune. The hundreds of crabs had merged, their tiny bodies coalescing into a humanoid form. Claws waved and snapped along the length of the body, as if every part of it were trying to reach me. Where the face should be, hundreds of eye stalks peered out at me. I scrambled to my feet and took off down the beach. I stole a terrified glance over my shoulder, and saw the thing running sideways after me, down on its hands and knees, like a human imitating a crab walk. I took a hard left up the stairs leading away from the beach, rushed to my car, and flung the door open. While I reversed out of the spot, the crab man emerged from over the dune and stopped on the edge of the sand. It watched me the whole time I drove away.



Last night, back home in Houston, I lay awake thinking of what had happened. The only thing that gave me any comfort was the fact that it had stopped at the edge of the sand. I figured that since I live far from the beach, I should be safe. I turned towards the window, looking out at the concrete cityscape beyond. There, in the playground across the street, I swear I saw a crab burrow in the sand.
