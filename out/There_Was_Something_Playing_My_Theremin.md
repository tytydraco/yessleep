The first time I heard it, I was just practicing. Just doing my usual thing—hand up, hand down, keeping my movements soft, careful, letting the sound drift out like silk. The theremin’s tone is so fragile, like a breath that could stop at any moment if you’re not gentle with it. That's what I loved about it, I think. It was just me and the air, and the tiny vibrations between us. No one to see, no one to judge.

I was alone in my practice spot, this clearing out in the trees. It was quiet, with sunlight slipping through the branches, turning the dust into tiny golden stars. The first notes floated up, high and thin, and I started to feel that warmth inside, the one that made me feel like maybe I was safe, even here in these woods, even with all the other campers wandering around.

But then—no, this sounds ridiculous I'd say—then I thought I heard something. Just… a whisper, faint and shivering, almost like it was hiding behind the music.

I lowered my hand, the note slipping away, and listened. Nothing but the wind stirring through the pines, and yet I felt something…not so much watching as listening. I took a deep breath, told myself to shake it off. Still, I kept glancing over my shoulder the whole way back to camp.

That night, I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, my nerves buzzing. I couldn’t stop thinking about the whisper, replaying it in my mind even though it was just a sound, barely even there. I’d convinced myself it was all in my head until Sam leaned over her bunk and asked, “You heard it, didn’t you?”

I turned, and she was looking at me with this weird little smile, like she knew exactly what I’d been thinking about. “Heard what?” I mumbled.

“The Weaver.” Her voice was just a whisper. “Everyone knows about it. The Weaver’s… a thing that lives in the forest, a kind of creature, or maybe a spirit, no one knows for sure. It’s supposed to prey on people like us—on musicians. Especially musicians with… well, you know. Secrets.”

She didn’t know about my secrets, of course, but I felt a chill slip over me anyway. “What… what does it do?”

She leaned in closer, her eyes wide. “It can take on any shape, any form, anything you’re afraid of. And if it finds you, if it latches onto you… it starts to play *you*. Your fears, your thoughts, your music. It turns it all into its song, and you can’t do anything but listen as it twists you into… whatever it wants.” She sat back, smirking, like it was just another campfire story.

But I didn’t sleep that night. The idea of something that could twist my music, make it into something I’d never choose, something that wasn’t me—I hated it. And worse, I couldn’t help feeling like Sam had been right, like the Weaver had already noticed me. Like it had already begun.

The next day, everything felt… wrong. The sunlight was too bright, the forest too still. My theremin, normally my only source of comfort, felt heavy in my hands, and my music… my music didn’t sound like mine anymore. Each note came out different than I wanted, the sounds drifting into strange, unsettling tones, like they were being stretched and pulled by something invisible. And the whispers—they were back, too, sliding between the notes, too faint for anyone else to hear.

I told myself it was just nerves, just my stupid imagination. But then I heard it: my name.

*Amelia.*

My blood ran cold. The voice was soft, distant, like it had been carried on the wind, but I knew it was real. I knew it was calling me.

That night, I lay in bed, too scared to close my eyes. But the whispers came anyway, slipping into my thoughts like they’d waited for me. And then, faintly, I heard my theremin. A single note, low and eerie, drifting through the cabin like a dark lullaby. My heart pounded, and I squeezed my eyes shut, but the music grew louder, twisting itself into something awful, something wrong.

It was my music, but it wasn’t. The notes coiled and warped, bending into a melody I’d never played. A horrible, hollow feeling washed over me, as though the Weaver was reaching inside, taking my hands, making me play its song. I tried to move, to scream, but my body wouldn’t obey.

It was as if I’d become an instrument myself.

The Weaver’s instrument.

And as the music wrapped around me, filling me with dread, I felt myself slipping, like I was being pulled into the sound, becoming part of it, disappearing into its song.

I thought maybe it was just me. The whispers, the eerie twists in my music, that creeping feeling of something watching. But by the third day, it was clear I wasn’t the only one. Strange things were happening all around camp, things no one could explain.

First, there was Ethan, the cellist, normally so calm and unflappable. He’d been fine that morning, practicing in the open field by the lake. But when he came back to the cabin after lunch, he looked pale, his hands shaking as he set down his cello. He tried to play through it, but his fingers stumbled, scratching out sour notes, as if something in his music had gone wrong. Later, I heard him mumbling to himself in the cabin, words I couldn’t make out, like he was arguing with someone who wasn’t there.

Then, one of the flute players, Sarah, had a breakdown during a rehearsal. She’d played fine—beautifully, even—but suddenly she just stopped, her eyes wide and unfocused, clutching her flute like it was the only thing keeping her safe. She claimed she’d seen someone in the woods watching her, someone that looked exactly like her, only with hollow, empty eyes. By the time the counselors reached her, she was sobbing, completely inconsolable.

The Weaver had started weaving its web.

I tried not to think about Sam’s story, the one about the Weaver preying on musicians with 'secrets'. But the more I saw, the harder it became to ignore. It was like the whole camp had fallen under a spell. Each day, someone else would drift off, or stumble back from their practice spot looking dazed, hollow, like they’d left something behind in the woods that they couldn’t get back.

And at night, the whispers grew louder.

Every time I closed my eyes, I heard it—the faint, taunting hum of my theremin. Notes I didn’t remember playing echoed in my mind, low and twisted, wrapping around my thoughts like spider silk. My dreams were filled with shadows, each one tugging at my hands, pulling at my voice, trapping me in endless, dark corridors filled with music I didn’t recognize as my own.

By the fifth day, I couldn’t even bring myself to practice. I stayed in my cabin, but even there, I could feel the Weaver’s presence. It had found its way into our minds, spinning webs made of our fears and memories, as though each of us were an instrument for it to pluck and pull.

There was that night, Sam woke up screaming, gasping for breath like she’d been drowning. “It… it was here,” she whispered, her face ashen. “I saw it. It took my face, Amelia. It looked just like me.”

None of us could sleep after that.

Later that night, I found Sam sitting by herself near the fire pit, her face pale and drawn. She hadn’t spoken much about the whispers, but I could see the strain in her eyes, the way she avoided making eye contact with anyone.

I sat next to her, uncertain of what to say, but something in me pushed past the fear. “Sam?” I asked softly. “You don’t have to hide it, you know. I’m… I’m scared too.”

Her eyes flickered up at me, and I saw something raw there—a vulnerability, like she had been carrying it all alone. “I didn’t want to tell anyone,” she whispered, voice cracking. “I thought if I did, it would just make it worse. But… I hear the music, Amelia. I hear it, and I feel like I’m losing myself. Like I’m becoming a part of it.”

I felt my heart ache for her. I understood that fear more than she knew. That fear of being consumed by something you couldn’t control, something that played with your mind until you couldn’t tell what was real anymore. I put a hand on her shoulder, my own voice trembling. “You’re not alone, Sam. We can face it together. All of us.”

Over the next few days, I saw the same fear in the faces of other campers, the quiet ones who kept to themselves. Slowly, they began to open up. And each time they did, I realized how much I had in common with them—the same vulnerability, the same fear, the same dread of being controlled, manipulated by something we couldn’t understand.

Together, we started talking more, sharing our experiences. Some of the others had heard the music, too. Some had felt the shadows closing in. One girl, Eliza, spoke about the feeling of being watched while playing her flute, and how every note felt like it was being pulled out of her, twisted in the air before it could reach its proper pitch. Another camper, Marcus, said he’d seen the shadows follow him, the way they slipped behind trees, always lurking just out of sight.

I listened, I absorbed, and for the first time since arriving, I felt a flicker of strength deep inside me. These were my people. We weren’t alone in this. There was something in the way they shared their fears that made them all seem less like victims, and more like fighters. And I knew that I had to do everything in my power to help them fight back against The Weaver.

When I finally spoke, my voice was steadier than I’d expected. “The Weaver, it’s controlling us, manipulating us. But it only has power because we’re afraid. We have to face it, together. We can’t let it win.”

The group rallied around me, and I saw a spark of hope in their eyes. My sensitivity, the very thing I had always viewed as a weakness, had become a bridge—connecting me to them, and them to each other. It wasn’t just fear we were sharing. It was strength. It was understanding. We were all in this fight together.

Then that moment sorta leaked away, and the reality of our daily nightmare rolled in. Where I'd felt strong and supported I suddenly felt alone and weak. Maybe this was just because I felt like I was reliving the helpless silence that I had suffered through when I was younger, my secret, or maybe it was the Weaver exploiting those feelings of helplessness. It felt like some kind of trap either way.

We were trapped, like flies caught in a web, held by invisible threads that tugged at us in the dead of night. The Weaver didn’t just watch us—it *played* us, each of us caught in its dark, twisted melody. And the more it pulled, the emptier we felt, as though something inside us was slipping away, being stolen note by note.

At one point I actually tried to tell myself I was imagining it, that it was just a story, but deep down, I knew the truth. The Weaver was no myth. It was real. And it was here, lurking in the shadows, taking pieces of each of us until there would be nothing left but silence.

I was shaking when I walked into the big counselor’s office. Everything in me wanted to turn back, to go back to the cabin and pretend that none of this was happening. But the silence—the way nobody would talk to the adults about the strange things happening around camp—reminded me too much of before. Of the times things had happened, and everyone had just… kept quiet about it.

The counselor looked up, a little surprised to see me. “Amelia? What’s going on?” Her voice was calm, but I saw her eyes narrow a bit as I started to explain.

“It’s just that…” I hesitated, forcing myself to keep talking. “I keep hearing weird music. Not mine. It… it comes from somewhere else. And there are shadows that move when no one’s there. I feel like… like something’s watching us.”

She studied me, and for a brief second, I thought she might believe me. But her expression shifted, her brows knitting together like I was saying something embarrassing. “That’s… quite an imagination you have, Amelia. Why don’t we call your aunt? Maybe she’d like to come pick you up.”

“No! I’m not making this up!” My voice came out louder than I’d meant, and the surprise in her eyes twisted into something closer to pity. The look that told me she thought I was just a troubled kid, a problem to be solved by sending me home.

My stomach turned in knots. She didn’t believe me. Nobody ever did.

The big counselor went to the front of camp's office, to use the phone there, with her back to me. She was already dialing my aunt’s number, speaking in that soft, careful tone people use when they think you’re just overreacting. I could practically feel the walls closing in around me, the way they had before, the same way they did whenever people refused to see what was right in front of them.

"It's going to be okay, Amelia. This happens to a lot of new campers. It's her option to come get you if you're having a problem."

Desperation clawed up my spine, and as her voice droned on into the phone, my eyes wandered to the bookshelf. That’s when I saw it—a small, leather-bound journal with “Camp Black Hollow – 1963” written on the cover. Something about it made my heart skip. Sam had mentioned a journal she’d seen once in the counselor’s office, one that held old, forgotten stories about the camp. Stories she’d overheard the counselor say shouldn’t be read by 'impressionable kids'.

Before I could second-guess myself, I slid over to the shelf, slipped the journal out, and tucked it under my sweater. I took a deep breath, steeling myself, and in one quick movement, I climbed out the open window and darted away from the office, my heart racing as I ran back to my cabin.

Inside, the world felt quiet again, but I couldn’t shake the pounding in my chest. I held the journal close, feeling its rough edges press into my hands. I could just leave. I could run from this, let my aunt come and pick me up, leave the other campers to… whatever this was.

But I knew what happened when I ignored the things that frightened me. I knew how silence and ignorance could allow an atrocity continue. I couldn’t leave Sam and the others alone with whatever was out there. Not if I could do something—anything—to stop it.

Hands trembling, I opened the journal. The pages were filled with spidery, slanted handwriting. My breath caught as I read the first few entries, which described strange dreams and music that echoed in the dark, voices that whispered in the trees. The final pages were even more frantic, describing a creature called the Weaver, a thing that preyed on musicians, wrapping its threads around their minds until they became something twisted, something broken.

*August 10th. There’s a talisman in the woods, hidden at the edge of the lake. They say it can repel the Weaver and seal its portal. I don’t know if I can find it, but I have to try. I can’t let it take any more of us.*

I felt a chill run down my spine as I closed the journal, gripping it tightly. I didn’t know if I could find this talisman, or if it was even real. But I knew one thing: I couldn’t just run away. I had to try.

Tomorrow, at dawn, I’d go to the lake.

I woke with a start, shivering in the cold. The cabin was still dark, and the air felt heavy, like the night was clinging to the walls, refusing to let go. I couldn't remember when I had fallen asleep, only that I hadn't slept well, not really. My head was a mess—thoughts and whispers all tangled together, so much uncertainty. The terror of what I had seen... what I had almost become... it still clung to me like a fog. I was shivering, but I wasn’t sure if it was from the cold or something deeper, something wrong inside me.

The faint light of dawn had barely broken through the windows, casting pale, fragmented patterns across the floor. I felt disconnected from myself, as if I were watching my own hands move as I dressed, each motion slow and deliberate, as if I could stop time if I willed it. The chill outside seemed to creep into my bones as I stepped out of the cabin, the cold air biting at my skin. The ground was damp from the night, but I barely felt the earth beneath me as I walked, my mind too focused on what I needed to do.

I had to find the talisman.

But as I stepped into the clearing, something felt off. Like I wasn’t entirely there. My body moved as if it had a mind of its own, and I was only an observer. Was I really awake? Was this real, or was I watching myself as I had watched myself fall into this nightmare?

I couldn’t tell anymore.

The camp around me was still mostly silent. The cabins were dark, the campers still asleep, unaware of what had happened the night before—or maybe they did, but they couldn’t bring themselves to speak of it. The darkness that hung over the camp, like a cloud, seemed to block out the early morning light, the patches of midnight lingering like black cobwebs in the corners of my mind. The air was thick with something I couldn’t explain, and it made my stomach churn.

I couldn’t stop. I had to keep going.

I pushed through the forest, each step slower than the last, until I reached the edge of the lake. The journal had said something about the talisman being near here, but how could I find it? What was I even looking for? A stone? A charm? The description was maddeningly vague. The earth felt cold beneath my feet, and the trees loomed over me like silent witnesses to the horrors I couldn’t escape.

The silence was suffocating. The only sound was the rustling of leaves in the breeze, and my breath—ragged, shallow—as I tried to make sense of everything. But there was no sense. I was grasping at shadows.

And then, I felt it.

The air grew thick, pressing against my skin, my chest tightening. A whisper, faint but unmistakable, like a breath in the dark.

“Amelia…”

I froze. The whisper was inside my head, too close to my ear, like it was coming from behind me. My heart began to pound as I turned, my eyes straining to find the source. But the forest was still, eerily so. No movement. No shape. No sound—except for the one that crept into my thoughts, slithering, growing louder.

“Amelia…” The voice was colder now, more insistent, as though it had been waiting for me. Waiting for me to hear it.

I could feel it. The Weaver.

It was watching me. Waiting. The very air seemed to twist around me, bending to its will. The shadows stretched out, shifting, pooling into shapes I couldn’t quite understand. I wanted to scream, but the words caught in my throat. My body was frozen, each movement sluggish, like the very forest was holding me in place.

And then, I heard my aunt’s voice—louder this time, sharp and real.

“Amelia!”

I snapped my head to the side, blinking, confused. She was there, standing just outside the clearing, her figure framed by the dim, early light. She was real. She was here.

“Amelia, come here! NOW!”

Her voice was cutting through the fog of terror, pulling me back. Without thinking, I turned and ran toward her, the fear still hot on my heels, but her voice was my anchor, pulling me away from the nightmare. The ground seemed to push against me as I ran, as if the earth itself was reluctant to let me go. The dark trees whispered, reaching for me, but I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t look back.

I stumbled into my aunt’s arms, and she wrapped them around me so tightly, I could hardly breathe, but it didn’t matter. I needed her. I needed her warmth. Her presence was the only thing that felt real anymore.

“Shh, it’s okay. You’re safe now,” she murmured, her voice steady, grounded. She didn’t ask me anything. She didn’t need to.

I couldn’t look at the camp again, couldn’t bear to think about it. The Weaver was still there. Still waiting for me to return, to fall into its grip again.

I let my aunt guide me away from the woods, away from the camp. The first light of dawn was creeping through the trees, but it didn’t feel like morning. It felt like the world was holding its breath, suspended between night and day, waiting for something terrible to happen. But I wasn’t going to let it.

I left everyone behind. I knew I had. Sam, Eliza, Marcus—they were still there, still in the grip of whatever had taken them. Whatever had almost taken me.

But I couldn’t go back. I couldn’t save them.

As the car pulled away, I looked out the window, my chest tight, knowing that something terrible was still out there, in the shadows, and I was leaving it behind.

But as my aunt squeezed my hand, I couldn’t shake the thought that I would be okay. For now.
