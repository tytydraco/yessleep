Not sure how this will be received but I gotta get this out there in case anyone is thinking about doing what I did. 

And that would be going hunting in Utah’s Fishlake National Park. Alone. At night.

Okay, so first off please don’t DM me—I know it’s illegal in a thousand different ways. Hunting at night? Check. Trespassing on private property? Check check. In fact, I’m pretty sure using thermal goggles to hunt deer is also outlawed but don’t quote me on that.

But before last week, I honestly didn’t give a fuck. I’m not a poacher or trying to bag some trophy buck while he’s sleeping. I mean, snagging a wall hanger would be sweet, don’t get me wrong. But that wasn’t what got me behind the wheel a quarter past midnight two Sundays back, making my way from Park City to the heart of the wilderness.

It was about the thrill. That feeling of doing something I wasn’t supposed to. The freedom of standing under the stars in the middle of nowhere, untethered from rules and expectations. It’s the same force that gets graffiti artists sneaking down highway on-ramps and teens knocking over mailboxes on a Saturday night. In a way, doing something illegal is the definition of freedom.

But that’s not really the fuckup. Wasn’t like I got found out. The fuckup is what I found.

On the drive out, I was figuring I’d have to park my Jeep far from the border fence. But on a hunch, I decided to get right up close to the guard station along the Joseph Mountain Road entrance. And wouldn’t you know it—the goddamn gate arm wasn’t even down.

I don’t care how many “No Trespassing” signs they had up—you don’t got a locked gate or at least a guard on duty and you’re basically begging me to come in and play. “Punishable by up to three years in prison” wasn’t gonna sway me either.

Anyone who’s been knows the park is goddamn massive. Nobody was gonna notice me skulking around for a few hours.

Wasn’t until I was about ten minutes into the pitch-black wilderness that my heart started to pump. Seeing the world of trees and brush materialize in my headlights got me a bit keyed up. Kept thinking I’d see something pop into those high-beams at any moment.

But nothing did. I was truly alone out there.

I pulled the Jeep into a dirt shoulder and killed the engine. Felt like I’d turned off the world. If not for the stars above, I might’ve thought I’d gone and died. Couldn’t be dead, though, because I felt more alive than ever. Felt fucking good.

Brought a basic Remington 700, which I slung over my shoulder. With my hunting pack and my thermals hanging around my neck, I clicked on my Maglite and jumped from my car. Threw a pin down in Google Maps so I wouldn’t be searching for the Jeep later.

The night was unnervingly quiet. Figured on that familiar chorus of crickets shrieking or at least some nocturnal animal activity. But no. Pure silence around me. Not even a breeze to rustle the evergreens.

Only sound in the world was the crunch of my boots through the underbrush.

I hiked about a mile into the woods with my Maglite combing the ground before I started finding signs of game. A few broken branches, hoofprints in the soft earth. Felt exhilarating.

I tend to lean more to the ‘get drunk in a blind’ kinda hunter. Used to have a bumper sticker on my old 4x4 that said “The worst day hunting still beats the best day doing anything else.” I know, don’t get on me. I was 24 at the time. Point is, this was real fucking hunting. Had to pull out all my Eagle Scout training for this shit.

Middle of nowhere, I felt like I was getting close. Found a print that couldn’t have been more than an hour old, and heard some activity beyond the reach of my light. Skin was tingling. Figured this was the time.

So I clicked off the light. Let the black void wash over me.

My eyes adjusted, the stars above came into focus. I listened.

Nothing.

So I slung the thermal goggles on. Strapped that elastic band across the back of my head.

They hummed nice and soft as they powered up, and just like that—

My entire world faded up from black to shades of icy blue.

The entire forest stretched out before me.

A cold, serene expanse.

But no goddamn heat signatures.

I scanned the area. Looking for any hint of warm color. But there was nothing. No deer, no raccoons, not even a goddamn squirrel. Couldn’t believe it. Figured I’d have at least a few animals hiding around me in the dark. But I was truly alone.

But just then, I saw it.

At first, I thought the goggles were glitching.

Fifty feet away, there was a man. Or at least through the goggles it *looked* like a man.

Except it wasn’t that standard infrared mix of red, orange, and yellow.

No, it was completely black against the blue surroundings. Not warm, not even cold. To be that dark, that thing had to be sub-fucking-zero. Like a void carved from the landscape. A negative space.

At first, I didn’t know how to react. I couldn’t understand what I was seeing. I stood dead-still at least a minute, just staring. I felt my blood rise into my face with each passing second as I slowly realized how impossible this thing was. The rational part of me said it had to be a trick of the goggles. Some kind of interference or weather phenomenon. Like a pocket of chill or something. Makes no sense, but that was the best I could come up with.

Even still, I didn’t believe it because I couldn’t shake this feeling in my gut.

*That it was watching me.*

After an eternity of that staring contest, I finally yanked the goggles off and flipped on my Maglite. I pointed it right toward the spot where it stood. But there was nothing there.

Just trees, foliage, and the infinite black night beyond.

My stomach told me to just get the fuck out of there. But I had to double-check what I saw. Flashlight off again, I put the goggles on. They were still humming as the world went indigo.

And there it was. Still standing exactly where it had been before. Still staring, just like when an animal catches you looking at it and freezes, on edge, deciding if it needs to book it or not.

Just then, my heart jumped into my throat.

A twig snapped to my left.

I whipped my head around and my stomach dropped.

There was another one.

And this guy was *moving*.

Slowly weaving through the trees like it was just snooping around, curious.

I wish I could describe these things better for you. In the blue landscape of the thermals, they are like living shadows. Flat and depthless. Negative space is really the best way to say it. They are like those accordion arts-‘n-crafts projects we all did back in elementary school. The ones where you cut a stick figure out of a folded piece of paper and open it up to reveal twenty empty-space figures in a row.

And now that I knew what I was looking for, suddenly I realized that there weren’t just two.

I did a 360. A super slow turn so I wouldn’t make a sound. Hell, I was even holding my breath at this point. They were all around me. Some standing still, some walking. One or two were bent down low, inspecting shit on the ground like they were scientists taking samples.

But none of them seemed the least bit concerned that I was there. Either they didn’t notice me or they didn’t care. I took a step back, and none of them reacted to the sound of the leaves crunching under my feet. I was safe.

That’s when I should have just packed it in and peaced out. But of course I didn’t. The adrenaline of trespassing had nothing on the feeling of seeing these things. And I guess I wanted more.

The nearest one was only a few feet away, near a tree. Staring up into its branches by the look of it—although it was impossible to tell if it was facing away or toward me. These things were literally featureless.

So against my better judgment, I crept up to it.

It didn’t react to my proximity, so I figured I was still in the clear. Something inside me wanted to know if it was as empty as it looked. Like, if I tried to touch it, would my hand go straight through and touch the tree bark beyond?

So I reached out.

Real slow so I wouldn’t scare it or its buddies.

My fingers extended.

Until finally—

I touched it.

It wasn’t as empty as it looked.

It was solid, and touching it fucking HURT.

The moment my fingertip made contact, pain shot through me like an electric shock. I jerked my hand back. In the thermal vision, my finger had gone totally blue. Frostbite. Knew by morning it would be bright red and singing.

But that wasn’t the worst part.

As I held my finger tight in my hand, I noticed something.

The figure had turned toward me, looking straight at me.

*A foot from my face.*

I staggered back.

The others—all of them—had stopped what they were doing.

*They were all looking at me.*

Their attention was suffocating. Even though they didn’t have eyes, I could feel their gaze, cold and piercing, like icicles stabbing into my chest. And then—

They started moving.

Not fast, but deliberate.

Toward me.

All in this identical, unhurried gait. Like they knew they didn’t need to rush.

No more fucking around—I finally took off.

I tore outta there, straight through the blue woods. Branches slashing my face and arms. Had to hold my goggles on to keep them from slipping. Hadn’t run that fast since high school track. Didn’t dare look back, but I could hear them. The soft crunch of leaves. Those deliberate steps. So slow and yet somehow always just a few feet behind me.

By the time I got back to the Jeep, my quads were on fire. I tossed my 700 in the back and jumped in the driver seat. Felt like at any second I might feel an ice-cold hand on my shoulder. But I got the door closed and slammed the keys into the ignition. Flipped on the headlights out of instinct and nearly fucking blinded myself.

Turned em off, let the spots dance away from my vision before I drove away with my goggles still on.

And as I got out of there, I glanced in the rearview mirror.

They were there, standing at the edge of the road.

All of them. Black, featureless forms beyond the glare of the taillights’ heat.

That was a week ago. My finger is okay, I guess. The frostbite wasn’t as bad as it felt, but the skin’s still  numb and strange. Didn’t go to urgent care. Don’t trust doctors, but that’s a different story.

I keep telling myself they weren’t real, that it was some kind of hallucination or malfunction with the goggles. But deep down, I know that’s not true. And they weren’t hostile until I decided to be a fuckhead and touch one.

I was stupid. Moronic. Idiotic. All of the above.

And what’s more insane—

I’m thinking about going back.
