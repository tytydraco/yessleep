I found a camera broken apart outside of a summer home in Tennessee, a girls body inside. Her eyes had been ripped out and her body turned inside out nearly. The card inside was damaged, but I managed to salvage it…the police dont know I have this, and This is what was inside of the camera…I’m sorry.

[Static shows for a moment, before a young blonde looking teen girl appears infront of the camera. Her eyes look tired. With bags under them and dark circles so dark it looks like shes a skeleton. Soft scratchin can be heard outside of the area the girl is in. She looks manic, afraid. She’s trembling like a leaf. She looks malnourished as well.]

I have to be quick. I locked and boarded everything i could, but their gonna get in eventually…i just dont know when.
My name is Hannah Macer, i’m 17 years old, i’m from Tennessee, and i am the only child of Alan and Sarah Macer. On my 17th birthday I received a camera. I’m a photographer and often find myself hating my iphone camera due to how minimal it can be. 

I was so excited- i got a professional camera! My family must really love me! I ended up starting to photograph EVERYTHING. Just looking around, snapping photo’s, stuff like that.
I eventually printed out the photos and they all looked good, so I decided to hang them on my dream board in my room. As I was hanging up my photos i suddenly noticed something odd inside of one. Behind one of the people in my photo was a…god how do i describe it- a shadow I guess? It was weird. It had no shape, but it also looked…humanoid? But in a odd way. I just dismissed it and tossed it. The more i looked at my photos though, the more i saw. They where in all of them- just barley put in the corner, but they where there. 

I was a bit freaked out, but thought my camera was the problem, so I ended up just covering up the board for the moment and went to bed. 

It got so much stranger though.
As the days went on, i kept seeing things in the corner of my eye, and hearing whispering. I don’t know what the hell was happening, but no one believes me.
The chaos started though when i was left alone at my parents so i could study properly, i was tired from the lack of sleep due to the odd shit happening so i maybe am exaggerating, but the house was so fucking loud. I kept seeing shadows everywhere, trying to get close, but everytime i looked they seemed to run away from the corner of my eye. I was so scared. I ran to my room and locked the door at one point, hearing the creaking and odd whispers outside. I cried as i waited for it to stop, but i didnt until my family got home.
This went on for weeks, more shadows gathering everywhere until i couldnt sleep, and i ended up recording everything with my camera, because they seem to not like it when i use it, it keeps them away…or at least at bay.

My family tried to talk to me, but i couldnt tell them. I couldnt tell them it all started with this gift. with this stuPID FUCKING CAMER-

[The girl hits the camera, and it falls. Static rings for a moment until the girl appears again, the lens now broken and the girl gripping her hair and sobbing.]

I’m sorry…i’m so sorry…i’m just so tired. I can’t sleep though. If I show a moment of weakness they’ll tear me apart…I can’t go yet. Not yet.

[The girl pauses as a large thump is heard outside of the room, a small laugh leaving her.]

Stupid fucking bitch…I LOCKED THAT WAY TO!

[The girl runs a hand through her hair before a look of fear returns to her, and she gives a sigh, and appears to nearly doze off, before shooting awake and shaking her head.]

I…I decided to come to our summer house to try and keep my family safe. If they find out whats happening…what I saw…they’ll be targeted to…oh god- i’m putting you in danger to…but- someone HAS to know! Someone! Anyone…

I-I came here though and locked everything so I could get a few more hours without distractions- though they followed me here to…of course they have…I don’t know what they are- but they lurk in the shadows, and their just out of your eyes view. If you know their there, they will kill you.
They will make sure you aren’t heard from again.

If you can, tell my parents I love them, that i’m sorry for acting so strangely i just need to protect them…I need to keep them safe. It’s to late for me- just…just tell them that.
…I think…I think I said it all…yeah. But- to whoever sees this, maybe if we can get enough people to know about these things- we can fight back. Know why their here…just keep running- don’t stop. Don’t let them know you know they exist. Please…please…

[The girl takes a moment to adjust the camera before sighing and leaning against the wall, her eyes shutting. She seems to fall asleep. As she does, the camera begins to fuzz over, screaming like no other coming from outside, before the video finally stops.]
