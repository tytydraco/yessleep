   I've worked remote tech support for a popular supply chain, but for sake of what little anonymity I care about,  I will refer to it as Muncher's. Been at the Muncher's restaurant chain for 3 years now. It's usually an easy, mundane job - *resetting passwords, rebooting frozen POS systems -* and the pay subpar. 

  But besides my boring day to day working from home, there is always one occurrence I have to look out for. This event has sent chills down to my spine the few times it has happened. At our company, very time an eclipse rolls around, whether it's a minor annular one or a total solar eclipse, the same creepy routine plays out.

   A few days before the eclipse, an email hits our inboxes with a dire subject line: 

*"SOLAR ECLIPSE PROTOCOL - STORE #000-3281"*

And as if this all wasn't shit-bricking (I coined that while here unironically) enough there is equally, if not more, unnerving piece of info about 000-3281. 

This store isn't listed in any of our system databases or location records. 

No phone. No emails listed. No zip code, IP addresses, or coordinates to determine where it is. All we at tech support know is, no matter where in the world an eclipse occurs: be prepared for 000-3281

The body outlines a series of unnerving rules pertaining to "000-3281".

The rules are as follows:

* Document the call like normally as best can
* Under **no circumstances** are we to remote into the site during the eclipse
* Only Muncher's CRM must remain open
* Any tabs/windows containing personal information must be minimized before totality
* If some(one/thing) requests a SPN speaker try to to get the SPN line according. 
* If you notice multiple languages in one conversation. Do NOT transfer, disconnect.
* We are **forbidden** from asking for or recording any address/location details
* If voice contact is initiated by the site, we are instructed to never deviate from a script (note: we *NEVER* use the script) 
* If someone/something asks any questions not related to Munchers (examples: *when your father’s next physical is* or *when you plan on visiting Cancun again)*, disconnect the call immediately
* In the event of signal cut-out, re-establishing a connection is strictly prohibited  


   Just reading the guidelines again is enough to make my skin crawl. 

What the hell goes on at this place during an eclipse that warrants such procedures? A more naïve me would've investigated. A lesson I learned ***never*** to do again.  


  The last eclipse was fairly recent, so this just happened. October 2023 to be exact.

I recall this being my second eclipse working (the first I was in training and they were smart to not mention this to incoming techs then), and I remember skimming over that email that autumn evening.

 Paranoia wasn't exactly the feeling I had reading this for the first time. I was more so annoyance. Immediately thinking this to be satire I sent a slack message to multiple agents trying to see if they also got the nonsense rules. Other techs did receive, but anytime we would try to chat regarding the eclipse or the email concerns, our messages would automatically *delete*. So weird. But chalked it up to the system auto-flagging messages between techs.

  That still, was my first hint that something was off. By the time I got the second hint, it was the day of the eclipse. Being as it didn't effect the state I lived in, I literally thought nothing of the whole ordeal that day, almost brushing off the email as satire. 

Then, Olga called. 

"Hola!" Olga's voice crackled through my headset as her call auto-populated with the haunting store number: 000-3281. "Olga Salazar, TL. Espanol?"   
  
"Hola, muy muy paquito", I responded politely in Spanish, expecting to just troubleshoot a normal technical issue. " Cómo estás?"  
  
"Ah sí, muy bien gracias," Olga replied, her accent lilting and warm like a grandmotherly type. As she said this I could have sworn I heard the faint sound of a cracking sound. Like bone. Though I was tense, like when you have a sense of dread before a big game, her kind tone helped ease the situation as I began running through my typical diagnostics. It was less than a minute though before I immediately became frustrated that this mystery store had *no* listed network details.   
  
That's when things took a turn into the **fucking** bizarre.  
  
"Tell me, *Jason*," Olga continued, her tone taking on a strange, reverberating quality. "How is your dear abuela's pain medication working these days? I know the dosages have been...difficult, to manage?"  
  
My blood went ice cold. How could she possibly know about my grandmother's health issues? Those were private family matters I'd never discussed at work. As she asked this the faint popping and cracking sound arose once more.   
  
"Wh-what did you say?" I stammered out. "How do you know abo—"  
  
"Silencio,"she barked, cutting me off in a whispered tone that sounded both quiet and like she was standing directly behind me. She then giggled into the phone before my headset soon became filled with slow saunter of laughter. Then the bone popping and snapping arose, now louder in the background of this cacophony like a dying newborn collapsing under a truck's weight.  

Different voices carried over the sounds; people, men, women and children. Then, she shushed them all.

"Sorry," Olga replied, her voice a completely different tone with a lower pitch. "They can all be so loud."

When she said this it sounded like the voices of 10 people speaking alongside her. "You see we want to cut to the chase Jason, we only have a couple of minutes left." The many voices shifted in out between different tones and pitches. Like numerous people - or entities - all talking at once pristinely. 

I sat there, frozen in fear. "If we could make Abuela Lupe walk good as new,  Jason, would you say yes?" 

These words caused the fattest lump to form in my throat. Then I heard it. "Would you Jason?" I heard the violent sound of bones snapping as the many voices became a singular tone and that of my abuela. "Would you *for me?*" Bones snapped loudly into the phone once more as if breaking in the same room as me. 

I'm not sure how but with that I found the strength to disconnect. Shutting down the laptop and slamming it shut in the process. 

I nearly threw up at my desk and my head was throbbing. Per protocol, I didn't engage further. My hands were shaking too violently to even log the interaction.

That's my unsettling experience I've had with Store #3281. More techs have stories but as mentioned above, for some reason, they keep disappearing from our Slack messenger. I digress, I know others probably have worse horror stories and I want to get to the bottom of this. 

Without dying. 

But for this upcoming totality in April? Don't worry about me following those rules to the letter. Maybe just calling out that day altogether. 

  
Because to this day, I still hear Olga's distorted voice(s) and the bone cracking. And unlike an eclipse, there are some things humanity is never meant to witness directly.
