I am Jakob Muller. This is my first entry of many. Me and my team of 4 are being sent to investigate mysterious deaths of which the cause is unknown near the Severney Island located North 400 Km off the Soviet Union. I was told that these deaths started a year ago in 1959. The U.S.S.R tried to find a cause for these deaths but failed. So, the soviets hired the best brains of the eastern block to find the cause of this virus.

We have arrived at the south of Severny Island. I have noticed nothing out of the ordinary on this island except the locals who looked at us in awe. We have set up camp in an abandoned warehouse. Its not too bad here. We have clean drinking water and good enough food to survive. We will be traveling to the north of the island in a weeks time after we set up our equipment.

8 : 00 PM  
The villagers warned us not to go north. But we still started anyways. On the way we saw dead animals, and bones of humans in abandoned villages. I wondered to myself “What kind of atrocity mustve happened here ?” . After 2 whole days of walking we reached the site where the deaths took place. We had reached the site on 29th of February. The site had an horrible smell. We set up camp just 800 m away from the site. We started exploring the site just to find the corpses of people lying around. Near the shoreline we found many dead fishes and walruses lying on the beach. It was indeed a horrific sight . All of us had chills down our spines.

1 : 00 PM  
We have gotten used to the sight of death. The smell of death doesnt bother any of us anymore. 4 of us started investigating the bodies of the dead. We couldnt find any causes to explain this phenomenon.

Upon further research we have concluded that only a virus could have caused such disater, a cell eating virus.The virus still lives in the bodies of the dead and are contagious to any living thing.After days of resecerch we have found that the virus eats up all the living cells in its hosts body.We assume that the virus was frozen inside glaciers since eons,this virus in particular seems to be able to exist in extreme cold in specific.It is assumed that the virus has come back due to the meting of glaciers caused by global warming.The virus started spreading through water, any living being that consumes it has been infected,including marine life

6 : 00 PM  
We are terrified to stay here,resources are slowly depleting in our camp,we are living a solitary life, our communication with the mainland has been disrupted.Our efforts of communication have not paid off even after a weeks time.   
25th April 1960  
8 : 00 PM  
Upon examination of our bodies, 4 of us realised that we had gotten into contact with the virus. It didnt matter who spread the virus or how it got to us. The only thing which mattered now was how much time we have left and how fast we can warn the soviets and the villagers of this incurable virus. The best option for us now would be to fix the communication systems or a few of us to go south and warn the villagers.

I have now found out that all the victims who contrated the virus are dead within half a month. Which means I have no less than 2 weeks of time.   
28th April 1960  
3 : 00 PM  
The skin on my body is slowly starting to shred just like a snakes skin. My eyesight is getting weaker as well as my sense of smell. But a good thing is that we have restored communications with the soviets.

9 : 00Am  
I assume I might die any moment now. I feel so much pain through my body. 4 of us have no hope left. But we have warned the soviets and the villagers successfully about the virus. The pain, the burning , the ache. I can’t take it anymore. Why am I still living?

This is my last entry. I hope someone recovers this dairy in the future.  
The main reason of this virus is the melting of the glaciers. This is caused due to the burning of the gas and oil in the USSR. Who knows what ancient dieases or  monsters we might discover after we melt all the ice…..
