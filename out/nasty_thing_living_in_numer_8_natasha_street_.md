When these things started to happen I was 4 and it stopped when we moved when I was 6.

A few things happened in this house so much so my mum and I have a name for whatever it was. We called it drafty because it would slam doors and windows, at least that's how it started. I guess mum thought if we gave it a name then I wouldn't be so scared. 

A few bits of context, I did not sleep alone in my bed until I was 7 (no judgement, after reading this I am sure you will understand). It was just my mum and I living in this house. I was (I still am actually) terrified of the dark. Also I have never ever sleep walked in my life. 

It started with the slamming of doors which wasn't all the time maybe twice a week. After this, birds started flying into the windows which in Australia, or anywhere I guess, is somewhat normal. In saying that it hasn't happened at any other house I have lived in. It was how often it happened that was alarming. It was a weird window honestly I will just attach photos of the house here somewhere. 

I remember coming home from the Ekka, a massive fair that comes in august every year in Brisbane, we had my aunty and cousins over when we got home and I remember mum taking my hubba bubba show bag off me because I was too young for chewing gum. I am only including these details because this is how vivid everything still is in my mind. My cousin Squash (a nickname), mum and aunty were all outside and I was sitting inside watching beauty and the beast with my other cousin J (also nickname). We weren't chatting I was too enthralled with my toys from the Ekka but all of a sudden I hear this guttural growl and looked around to see what it was. It was my cousin J. I asked her to stop because it was weird but she didn't acknowledge me and continued. I couldn't see her face. She has really long brown hair which was in the way, not like draped over her face like grudge she just had her head slightly down and I was next to her. When she continued to not listen to me I started to freak out. She is older than me and if this was a prank, which we have since discussed was not, she would have stopped as she was always so sweet with me and I was sobbing at this point. I ran outside crying hysterically. Both my mum and my aunt were really concerned. J followed after me also really concerned asking what had just happened. Now that we are older we have talked about this and from her perspective we were watching a movie and I asked her to stop and she asked me what was wrong and I just kept crying.  

  
Now this is the part that will never leave me. This is the reason I couldn't sleep alone. 

With everything happening in the house I didn't love sleeping alone even though mum had done everything in her power to fill my room with all the things I loved, I'm talking disney princess bed canopy, beautiful night lights just everything a little girl would love in her room but I could not and would not sleep in there. 

So my mum didn't love sharing a bed, so any chance she could have it to herself she would take it. We were watching tv in the lounge room and I had fallen asleep so she took this opportunity to take me to my bed. She would turn on my night lights, sing me my little song (mind you I was half asleep) and say goodnight. It was cute I am sure she felt so relieved to be able to sleep alone. 

That wasn't the case though.

I would wake up, standing in the middle of my room, night lights ALL off and my clothes scattered on the floor. All of this was terrifying on its own but it was the noise that made everything nightmarish. 

I had never had goosebumps like that before I couldn't stop shaking. I would start to collect my clothes off the floor in the dark and I heard it again. I swear on my life, my dogs life and even my mums that I heard the same guttural growling that I had heard a few months prior coming from my cousin. I bolted into my mums room.  

When I brought this up with mum she thought I was just silly and suggested a storm had surged the power and turned off my light (um no there were literally no storms) and suggested that I had been sleep walking (also absolutely not). 

So here I am 15 years later writing about it on reddit. I am 21, we moved to America for 6 years and now I am back in the same town as that house. I have even been in contact with the new tenants via email to which he has advised nothing weird has happened to him. I would love to find out as much history on this house as I can but it's proving to be quite difficult.
