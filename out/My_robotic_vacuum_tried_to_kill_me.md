I still regret the day I decided to do the demonic spell, one of the worst decisions I made in my life, it all started when I found a book on demonic sorcery in the library, I had heard the legends of men who had made pacts with demons in exchange for fame and fortune, i am deep in debt due to my gambling and drinking problem, i was desperate so i decided i had nothing more to lose and i took the book home, the instructions were pretty simple to follow.

First step: Pour some pepper on the ground making sure it is in a circular shape

Second step: Put four candles inside the circle of pepper in a square formation

Third step: Place a container in the middle of the candles and recite the invocation chant

I set out to follow all the instructions as quickly as possible and my desperation to find a container in the fastest way made me take my vacuum cleaner that was on the floor and put it in the center of the ritual, oh but what a fool I was.

Once everything was ready, I recited the words that were there in the book and an extremely powerful light blinded my sight, my heart was filled with terror and the shock caused me to faint.

When I woke up I heard a voice that my mind couldn't remember

Wake up, wake up the strange voice told me

I opened my eyes and what I saw left a mark on me to this day.

In front of me was my vacuum cleaner, which now emanated a strange voice from within its circuits.

Look what you've done idiot, said the voice, what kind of sorcerer are you

My mind couldn't process what I was hearing, my vacuum cleaner was talking to me

I'm not a sorcerer I said, I just wanted to make a deal with a demon, I'm heavily in debt

Hahahaha, humans and their abstract concepts are capable of committing stupidities and atrocities for colored paper with numbers without any real value

As far as I'm concerned the money only serves to start a good fire and take the souls of innocents in the process.

Humanity has built its own personal hell so full of unfair rules that it hurts the majority and benefits the few.

Just look at you, the typical sinner, obsessed with alcohol and gambling, you waste your life enriching someone else, the only ones who earn from your misery are the owner of the tavern where you are going to damage your kidneys and the owner of the casino in which you play fixed games that you will never win, your life is doomed to destruction if you consider following this path

But all that doesn't matter now, because now I'm going to kill you, the threatening voice told me

No please, I'll give you what you want, I told him, I only brought you here because of a deal with you I wanted to make

I must kill you and devour your corpse, only the one who summons me can control my body and since you are not a sorcerer nor are you versed in demonic arts you will be no match for me and my immeasurable power

I got up and tried to run towards the door, but when I got there my vacuum cleaner was waiting for me at the door.

Do not think that you will be able to get out of here easily and with impunity, because even if it is the last thing I do, I swear that I will take something from you, be it your life or a loved one, you may believe that you have nothing to lose but I assure you my summoner that you are going to lose something very precious when you manage to cross the threshold

I ran to the kitchen trying to find a knife with which to kill my murderous vacuum cleaner but when I got there what was my surprise to find the entity that had my appliance on top of a table consuming my forks spoons and knives

Hahahaha, you were looking for something invocative, the voice said with a mocking tone

I quickly ran to the back door, opened the sliding door and just when I was about to escape I heard a voice that gave me goosebumps.

You forget something summoning, the voice asked

I turned around and looked in horror at my vacuum cleaner covered in blood.

What did you do, I asked

It is not obvious summoner, the voice exclaimed, I ate your cat

A tear rolled down my cheek, you monster, I yelled at him

You call me a monster, the voice exclaimed annoyed, look who the drunkard without self-control tells me, I was raised in the flames of hell itself, you, on the other hand, are the son of men but you behave worse than an animal, your vices have corrupted summoner and look where they got you, straight to me

You are free to go, summoner, the voice explained, before I devoured your cat I managed to destroy the spell book, without it you will never be able to return me to hell

I didn't think about it much more and I ran as far as my capable legs were, in the distance I could hear the shrill laughter of my vacuum cleaner.

I have been able to tell about that traumatic experience more than 5 years ago and 2 years of sobriety, even so I have not been able to forget the vacuum cleaner that ate my cat.
