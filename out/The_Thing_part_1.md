Woke up from the sleep, check phone.. still its 4:47 I was getting hungry and thirsty,but i didn't dare to get out,the moment i decided to get out,there it was again the creature,none knows what whould have happened if i got out,checks phone again.. still 4:47Am,decide to go out,gets out of the closet, nothing in the distance,i went quietly in the kitchen,grabbed everything i could hold, slowly went back to the closet,the moment i closed the closet door,i heard it run,wait,i got a notification, thankfully my phone was on silent, the notification said "stop hiding,and I'll may give you mercy if you show up NOW",i hesitated but decided not to go out,the thing left the room,i check my phone again,still 4:47 am,i decide to go to sleep,lets hope it all ends..

Wakes up to a loud noise,the clock on the wall was about to go to 4:48 am,i was excited until i saw the thing crush the clock into pieces,i almost screamed,but remembered that thing must not find me,the flashlight batteries were running out,so i decided to go out and get some, i hesitated but went out,i looked back and saw the thing checking the closet,i breathed a huge sigh of relief knowing that the thing wont check the closet again,i got the batteries,now lets go back to the closet,went back,held the door,put the new batteries,checked phone,still 4:47 am what is happening,is this a nightmare i said as i started pinching myself,i wasn't waking up,this is... A real life nightmare,i checked my phone, still 4:47 am.., decided to go back to sleep hoping that the thing wont find me as I'm asleep..

Wakes up to the thing eating snacks in the kitchen, hearing the thing eating snacks made me hungry too, oh wait, i had a bag of chips in the closet im hiding, the problem is it will make noise if i try to open it, so i wait and wait for hours for a noise to happen so i can open the chips without it hearing me, hours passed its still 4:47 am, another hour passes and i hear the thing snoring loudly, thats when i open the chips, he didn't hear me thankfully, i start eating my chips quietly, while eating the chips,i check my phone and its still 4:47 ,wait, i got a text message from my brother, it says 

Brother:Are you stuck too?
