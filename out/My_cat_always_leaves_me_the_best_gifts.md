On the morning of Mother’s Day this year I received exactly one gift: a dead rat, deposited at my doorstep by my cat, James. James is black and white, slick and elegant, his fur like a tuxedo. If a cat was cast to replace Daniel Craig in the next Bond film, James would be perfect. In fact, the resemblance is how he got his name in the first place.

“Thank you, James,” I said, bending to stroke his fur as we both examined the little rotting carcass on the welcome mat. He looked up at me hopefully as if expecting me to take a nibble of his offering. “I’ll get to that later,” I promised.

The rest of the family had forgotten the holiday. Not that I blamed them. My husband Saito was busy at work, pulling 70-hour shifts as he prepared a series of PowerPoints to explain his company’s corporate structure to a potential buyer. In the meantime, the twins June and Lily were busy with spring soccer and last-minute prep for their upcoming AP tests. 

I spent some time idly making myself coffee while the family swept. Then, around 9:00 they all flew past in flurry, the twins off to a soccer game and Saito headed to the office. 

It wasn’t until they’d all left, that a lump began to form in my throat, and I headed to the backyard to have a little cry. I felt silly. It was a made up holiday, after all. Not like Christmas or a birthday (though Saito forgot my birthday too this year.) 

For a few minutes, I sat on one of the patio chairs, sniffling pathetically, hoping no one returned early to see me like this. 

I was about to go back in when I saw James. He was over in the corner of the yard, lying in the shade. Right away, I could tell something was off about him. James always slept curled in a ball, his chin resting on his rear haunch. Today, he was stretched out, bent awkwardly. Even stranger, he seemed to shimmer in the few spots where the dappled sunlight caught his fur.

Slowly, I walked over, clicking my tongue in the way he liked. When he didn’t move, I softly called his name. Finally, I reached out to touch him, only to find his fur wet. Drawing my hand back, I found it red and bloody in the sunlight, which is when I started screaming.



I called Saito a few minutes later.

“I need you to come home,” I said. “James is dead.”

“Your friend James? From college?”

“Our cat!” I realized I was screaming into the phone. “Our only cat!”

I could practically hear him roll his eyes on the far and of the line.

“It’s not a good day for this,” he said. “I can come back a bit early, take care of the body. Just leave it alone for now.”



I spent many hours alone that day, sitting in the backyard. In time, flies found James and began to lick at him with their little straw-mouths, dipping their horrible little hands in his blood and rubbing them together. It was no use shooing them away. 

I was sunburned raw by the time Saito came home. He looked at me, incredulous. 

“What happened to you?”

“I was standing vigil,” I explained.

He rubbed at the bridge of his nose.

“Where’s the cat?” he asked, and I gestured to the backyard. Every inch of my skin throbbed from the sunburn, but it felt right, like my inside and outside pain matched in some harmonious way.

Saito grabbed a wastebasket and started walking toward the backyard.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“Taking care of… of James,” he said, trying to use a gentle tone, as if explaining to a child that it was time for bed.

“You’ll bury him,” I said. “At the foot of the maple. Three feet deep at least.”

He shook his head.

“That’s not even legal, hon. Besides, I was working all day. I’m exhausted.”

“Three feet deep,” I said, and then I went into the garage to find his shovel. The one I located was unused, though we must have bought it years ago. I brought it in and handed it to Saito. He took it without a word and went outside.

An hour later, he came in dirty and sweaty. He headed to the shower.

I walked to the maple to find the earth there freshly disturbed from digging. Then I found one of James’s favorite toys–a fuzzy bird that had once had a bell inside–and affixed it to a stick, which I placed at the head of the grave.



At dinner, the twins showed up still in their soccer uniforms. They’d spent the day at the park with friends after the game. 

“Happy Mother’s Day,” said June, somewhat sheepishly. She handed me an envelope with a gift card to Jazzy Juice inside.

“Thanks,” I said. “What’s Jazzy Juice?”

“It’s a smoothie thing,” explained Lily. “It’s twenty dollars.”

“Thank you,” I said again, staring at the card. Maybe I was making a face.

“If you don’t want it, I can take it back,” said June. “My friends and I go there all the time.”

“No,” I said. “I love it. I’m sure I’ll love it.”

“Great,” she said, looking disappointed.



The next morning I went out into the backyard and screamed. 

James’s grave had been dug up. It was nothing put an empty hole surrounded by a pile of dirt. The stick and the toy were missing too. It didn’t seem that deep. By the time Saito ran out to see what was wrong, I was in tears.

“Three feet deep!” I shouted. “I said three feet deep.”

“The soil gets really rocky when you go down that far,” he said. “I figured it didn’t matter.”

“It mattered!” I screamed. 



I decided to take some ‘me’ time that afternoon, so I headed to Jazzy Juice. I tried to figure out the menu while I was in line, but I got overwhelmed by all the options. Finally, when I got to the front of the line, I asked if I could just get a basic orange juice.

“It would be more like an orange smoothie,” said the girl behind the counter, a thin redhead in her twenties, covered in tattoos.

“Oh that’s no good,” I said. “I don’t really like pulp. No pulp please.”

“That’s not really what we do here,” she said. “Maybe it’s a good day to try something new. The Berry Blitz is super popular.”

“I want my orange juice,” I said. I was probably a little rude, but I was at my limit. “I’ve got a gift card,” I added. “For twenty dollars.”

“Fine,” she said. And then, I swear, under her breath she added, “Boomer bitch.”

“Excuse me?”

She didn’t meet my eyes. Instead, she turned and started throwing frozen oranges into a blender.

“I’m forty-four!” I shouted over the noise as she started the blender. “I’m a Millennial! Maybe Gen-X!”

Finally, she handed me my drink. It was so pulpy it clogged the straw.

She shot me a shit-eating smile, “have a nice day!”

I chucked my drink in the garbage on my way out the door.



That night, I found myself crying as I tried to make dinner. I could see the little hole that had once contained James’s body through the kitchen window, and I couldn’t help glancing at it as I tried to peel zucchini. 

It struck me that James had been the only one in the world who loved me at all. Even worse, it seemed unlikely that no one would ever love me again. I was aging, chubby, and boring. The world didn’t want me anymore.

Without realizing it, I made a deep cut on my thumb and started bleeding everywhere. For a minute, I just watch the blood ooze out of me, all over the vegetables. 



That night, I heard a thump. I tried to shake Saito awake, but he was dead asleep. Finally, I got up and walked downstairs. There was another thump now, louder. Then a series of three more thuds right by the front door.

Slowly, I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and then walked through the darkness. As I did, I heard a familiar sound that seemed impossible: it was James’s distinctive meow, the little cry he’d deliver at the door when he wanted my attention. And yet it was somehow different now, a lower, deeper mewing.

“Hello?” I asked as I walked to the door, but there was no sound now. I heard footsteps outside, not a cat’s but something bigger, maybe human. 

Finally, I reached the door and slowly turned the knob. I opened it just a crack, peeking through to see if anyone was outside. 

At first, I saw no one. Just the empty street in the moonlight. A few night blooming flowers had opened their petals, but otherwise the neighborhood looked dull and lifeless. Then I looked down and had to stifle a scream.

There, on my doorstep, lay a body, its chest still fluttering with life but mostly torn to shreds. Great, bloody gashes had left the green apron in tatters, the skin’s intricate tattoos sundered to islands of nonsense. The girl’s red hair was now redder.

Though her skull was crushed, her pretty face nearly ripped off the skull, I knew immediately it was the girl from the juice shop.

My body tensed as I watched her chest cease its fluttering and the flow of blood slowed to a trickle. Soon, she was still as the rest of the street. 

Then, suddenly, my heart was pounding again, as I realized I was not alone in the darkness. Something dark and massive was moving past the nearby bushes, watching me examine its kill. 

Though it moved somewhat like a cat, the thing was far bigger, larger than any tiger I’d ever seen at the zoo. As it grew closer, I saw that it was standing on its hind legs, walking toward me, not quite like a person, but like an animal trying to mimic one.

I could barely breathe now. It was growing closer. Though it moved slowly, I could sense that it could cover the ten feet between us in a moment, far faster than I could slam the door.

“Please,” I said… “Don’t…”

As the creature walked into a slant of moonlight, I realized that it was dressed in a tuxedo. Or were those just the colors of its fur?

“My queen, I would never,” the creature purred, in a low voice. “I live only to serve you.”

I looked down at the dead girl by my feet. I would have to call the police, I knew. I would have to scream for Saito to come and help. There would be so much to explain. But I wasn’t afraid now. That moment had passed. I was here with a friend.

“James?” I asked, and he nodded ever so slightly. “You can’t do this,” I said. “I didn’t want this.”

“But she was so cruel to you,” said James. “She called you a very nasty name. I was hiding a few blocks away, but I heard everything. My ears are very sensitive.”

“But you can’t just kill people,” I said, trying to stuff my growing panic into my stomach. “It’s not… it’s not right.”

“Of course I can,” said James. “In fact, I must. It’s my nature.”

“Never again,” I whispered. 

James cocked his head, looking me in the eyes. What was he looking for?

“I could stop if you order it,” he said. “Though that would be unfortunate. You know I love to honor you with gifts. I always have. But go ahead. Make the command and I will disappear, never to leave you another present again.”

I looked down at the dead girl, all torn to shreds. There was a certain beauty in it, like a stained glass window, sublime in its brokenness. 

“Just say the word,” James said again.

But I didn’t.

“Thank you,” I finally said, bending to look closer at the dead girl. “For the gift.”

“It was but a trifle, my queen,” said the thing. “Until next time.”

And then, bowing slightly, he backed away and bounded into the [darkness](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).
