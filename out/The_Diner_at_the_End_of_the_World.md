It’s nights like these that I wish I had gone to college. 

You know those nights. The ones that are cold enough to shiver but not enough to turn the heat on. The slow ones that make your eyes slowly crawl to the back of your head. The ones where you can just barely make out a figure in the distance watching you, and you’re bored enough to watch back. You know? 

Maybe some introductions are in order. My name is Amelia. I’m nineteen and working “full-time” at a local diner. Well, not just a local diner. More like the local diner. All towns have one, but ours is special. Nestled in a sleepy town of Pennsylvania—just far enough from the Big Cities but close enough to feel their influence in the youth’s popular culture—you can find our Diner. We’re short-staffed, underdeveloped, and overrated. You know the works. 

Well, we weren’t always so short-staffed. That’s a recent problem, alongside the ominous dripping noise we can’t find and the subtle smell emanating from the walls. Whatever, it’s probably the building’s age. This place was built in the 50s, and it looks like it. With minimal renovations, like adding Central AC, it has all the glories of a retro diner, neon lights and all. But our Diner is “special,” as I said, I mean just look at our signed poster of Jayne Mansfield that’s been passed down from owner to owner. It was originally kept in the owner’s office, but it probably moved to the dining room when it was no longer socially acceptable to have jerk-off material in your office, and an owner realized that a signed poster of the celebrity could probably bring in more customers. 

“Do you think that fella is alright?” Came an Appalachian drawl. 

Ah, yes. My dear coworker, Mary-Anne Marie Williams, a fearsome 5'3" pile of woman. With hair as high as the heavens, as blonde as a whitewashed baby Jesus too, she cocked her head in the direction of the front windows. 

I looked over in the direction her head tilted and sighed. Yes, the figure off in the distance that’s been there for…at least an hour, if my watch is working (which it rarely does when I enter the Diner, for some odd reason). 

“How do you know it’s a fella?” I asked, leaning against the bar counter next to her. 

“Look at those broad shoulders. If it’s not a man, it’s a very unfortunate woman.” 

I sighed. “You can’t say stuff like that anymore—“ 

“I know, I know!” Mary-Anne said. “I hear it enough from my daughter. God, your generation's gonna be the end of me.” 

Her daughter and I had a bit in common, which is nice considering she sometimes picks up shifts here. All under the table, of course, since the boss isn’t willing to file more paperwork to hire an “every-now-and-then” employee. Mary-Anne’s daughter, Peighton Rose Williams, looks every bit like her mother, if not for the dyed black hair and overly large septum. She’s a nice kid, about sixteen, helpful in a pinch. 

But I’m getting off topic. The real reason I made this post is because we’re so short staffed tonight, we can barely fulfill orders. If you’re in the area—you know it, you don’t have to ask for the address—I recommend throwing in an application. Please. 

You see, I think I recognize the figure off in the distance. The one that’s been staring, watching, unmoving for at least an hour. I think it’s one of our line cooks, Ben. But that can’t be right. Ben called off sick for the week, said something about a highly contagious fever, combined with vomiting his guts up and signs of anemia. If it is Ben, then I’ll kick his ass for calling off sick just to play a stupid prank on us. It’s starting to get unsettling. Maybe it’s another tweaker that looks like Ben, though. I don’t know. 

Whatever. I have shit to do. The dripping noise is back, and Mary-Anne swears she’ll find it. I better accompany her before she tears those precious blond locks from her head in frustration. I’m a good co-worker like that. I’ll keep you all updated, I’m sure my plights in the service industry are “interesting.”

I swear, that figure looks so much like Ben. But something’s weird.
