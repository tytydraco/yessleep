Don't tell me to go to a doctor. I don't have health insurance, and I definitely can't afford to go to a hospital over my belly button. Besides, it can't be that hard to tie a new one. People did it for millennia before modern medicine. Someone can send me instructions or a video tutorial, and I should be good to go. Let me explain what’s happening anyway, just in case it’s important.

About two months ago, I was laying in bed scrolling tiktok when I came across a video talking about how some people actually feel it in their ass when someone touches their belly button. Of course, I did what anyone would do after just learning that. I stuck my finger in my belly button immediately and wiggled it around. It didn't feel like much at all, but when I had my finger in my belly button, I felt something in there. 

It was a hard little ball, like a rock almost. I had no idea how it got in there, since I really don't go outside like ever, and I kinda freaked out. I squirmed my finger around inside of my belly button while my phone played the stupid tiktok on repeat. It was going on about nerve systems and umbilical cords while I was trying to get the pebble out. Eventually I shoved my thumb and a finger inside and managed to pull it out.

It was about the size of a pencil eraser, but it was just harder and all black and crusty, and it smelled awful. Like body odor and sweat and old socks. I almost threw up right there on my bed.

I got up, shuffled to the bathroom, and carefully put the stone down on a square of toilet paper. Then I took a shower and scrubbed out my bellybutton until the skin was stinging and red, and I finally felt clean again.

I immediately searched for what the thing in my belly button was, and I learned about belly button stones. You’ve definitely heard of things like kidney stones or gall stones or tonsil stones. Well, turns out you can get belly button stones too. Except they’re not stones like mineral build-up. Belly button stones are made of dead skin and oils and hair. Basically they form because you’re not cleaning yourself well enough and it gets so dirty that all the filth compacts into one solid disgusting mass as hard as a rock. The thing that I had fished out of my belly button was a prime example.

I flushed the stone down the toilet while shaking at the idea that a part of my body had been so unclean. I could have gotten an abscess or an infection. I imagined what it would be like to have to go to a hospital for an infection I could have prevented if I had just been hygienic. The nurses and doctors would all roll their eyes at me and whisper behind my back about the idiot who couldn’t keep his own body clean. I vowed to be more vigilant about cleaning my belly button.

I try to be a clean person. I shower twice a day, sometimes three times. I wash my hands before and after eating or using the bathroom. I disinfect the bottoms of my shoes when I'm forced to go outside, and everything I bring into my apartment is fully wiped down with a cleaning spray. I wipe down my countertops with a bleach-based cleaner daily. I even mop my floors once a week with a disinfectant meant for hospitals that I buy online. I put a lot of time and effort into being as clean as possible.

But no matter what I did, I couldn't seem to keep my belly button clean. I washed it out with soap every day, twice a day, but every time I poked my finger inside it, it always came out smelling foul. At first, I just assumed it was because it was hard to clean thoroughly. So I started really getting in there. I scrubbed with a loofa, and then a washcloth. It hurt, but I got two fingers inside it at once to really get into all the folds. Then, after I showered, I swabbed it clean with disinfectant.

After about a week of that, it hadn't gotten any better. Whenever I checked it, it still smelled like sweat and dead skin.

I decided it must be some kind of infection. Maybe fungal, but probably bacterial. I bought topical treatments for both online from my favorite seller (the one I also get my hospital-grade floor cleaner from), and soaked some cotton balls in both before shoving them into my belly button.

I was so happy: I had been panicking about this for weeks, and now I had found a solution I was sure would work. And I was right! It was definitely an infection. Within minutes of applying the medicine, I could feel it working. Little zings of warmth and pain shot through my stomach as the infection burned away. It fought back hard, and by the time I changed the medication the first time, the skin inside my belly button was red and painful to the touch. By the second time I changed the wrapping, the cotton balls came away bloody, and when I squeezed the skin around my stomach, pus and blood oozed out of my belly button. It hurt, but I couldn’t stop smiling while I wiped it away and applied new treatment. Finally, I would get rid of this rot inside me.

It went on like that for a few weeks. I changed the dressing on my infection three times a day, and every day, more of the infection seeped from me. My stomach was hot and swollen as the latent infection gradually lessened. But before the infection could dissipate completely, the unthinkable happened. I ran out of medicine.

When I first squeezed my tube of ointment and air bubbled in the mixture, my stomach dropped. It was too soon to run out. The infection was still raging inside me, though I could tell it was starting to fail. The bleeding and pus were going away, and the pain was numbing. But if I stopped the treatment before it was entirely gone, it would come back again much worse. I know that much about how antibiotics work. This infection had been a bad one to start with. If I stopped treatment now, I might even die of it when it came back

The first thing I did was try to order more antibiotics from the same website I always do. It turned out, though, that since the last time I had ordered from there, the whole website had been shut down. I tried to find out if they had moved to another website or something, but the only information I could find was one article on a weird site saying they’d been shut down by law enforcement. I still don’t know what happened, but if I had to guess, it was probably because they were selling to people outside hospitals, and the high-grade stuff was deemed too good for us normal people to get our hands on.

Regardless of the reason they were shut down, it left me with a huge problem. I had no idea where else I could get the ointment, and I only had a couple more doses left.

I’m going to be honest. I didn’t react well to this news. In fact, I kind of freaked out. Not only was I out of medicine, but I also didn’t have much left of my other cleaning supplies. I wasted two hours of my precious time until I ran out of medicine hyperventilating on my bathroom floor surrounded by my bottles of soap and detergent and disinfectant.

By the time I pulled myself together, my phone alarm telling me it was time to change my bandages was going ringing. I peeled off the dressing on my stomach, pulled out the wads of blood- and pus-soaked gauze, and surveyed the infection.

My belly button had started as a half-inch wide hole. It had been shallow and filthy and infected. Now it was a nice clean divot almost three inches in length. The skin was red and puffy from the antibiotic drawing out the infection, and when I peeled away the gauze, dead infected skin peeled away too and clean red blood ran freely. The infection has run deep. Really deep. The hole was at least twice as deep as it had started out, and the bottom of it was still oozing pus.

I steeled myself and poked two fingers into my belly button. It hurt a lot, but it was more like the ache of a sore muscle than of an injury. It almost felt good. I pressed down as much as I could, trying to get any other pus out of the wound, and that was when I felt it. Something was underneath my skin. It felt like a pimple or a cyst or something like that: soft and squishy, but immobile.

I was almost to the source of the infection. Once I had drawn out that lump, I would be done. I was sure of it.

But before I could do that, I had to actually leave my apartment.

I almost never go out. I just don't like leaving my apartment. I get groceries and other necessities delivered whenever I need something. But I didn't trust a random delivery driver to pick out the right medicine for me, so there was no other choice but to go myself.

I wore a mask of course, and I got plenty of stares while I walked slowly down the road to the pharmacy around the corner. I had to go slowly so I wouldn’t flex any muscles in my stomach and cause pain, and I’m sure I looked like I was really sick. Which I was.

I wandered through the pharmacy, looking at all the weak topical antifungals and antibiotic creams with dimming hope. The cream I had been using wasn’t available of course, but there also wasn’t any medication that used that drug available at all. That was a huge problem for me. Switching antibiotics from something hospital-grade to an over-the-counter version of a totally different medicine was going to make the infection come back much worse.

I resigned myself to probably having to go to a hospital and go into debt to get treated, and I wandered over to the cleaning products in the store to get the next best thing to medical grade disinfectant. Bleach.

It was in the cleaning aisle that I had my stroke of genius. Antibiotics kill bacteria, and the stronger the antibiotic, the more bacteria it will kill. Of course you can’t use anything too deadly or it ends up killing the person too. But that’s the great thing about creams and lotions: they don’t get into the body. If I couldn’t get a strong antibiotic, I would just have to use something that killed more than bacteria. I might lose a little skin in the process, but I would be okay and infection-free afterwards.

I searched through the cleaning aisle and found a cleaner without any fragrance or scent and without any additional disinfectants that might hurt me more. I found one and I almost skipped up to the register to buy it I was so giddy.

The cashier gave me a weird look when I got to the counter, but she didn’t say anything. It was only once I was out of the store that I realized that I’d aggravated my infection from moving around and bled through my shirt. The cashier probably thought I was buying bleach to clean up a murder scene.

I made it home without anyone trying to stop me on the street. By the time I made it, it was time to change the medicine again. I used the last of my antibiotic ointment and set about soaking some gauze in a watered-down bleach mixture.

Before I applied the bleach for the first time, I poked two fingers into my bellybutton again. Just to check on the progress of the infection. The bulge I had felt before was much more prominent now. If I had the right supplies, I probably could have cut it open, but I hate knives and needles, so I didn’t have anything. I considered going to a dermatologist for the first time, but even that was so far out of my budget I couldn’t justify the cost. I had to deal with this myself.

The bleach hurt a lot less than I was expecting it to. There was a slight stinging around the edges of the infection when I applied it, but other than that, there was no discomfort at all. Almost immediately though, there was a slick soapy kind of feeling. I had to double-check that I hadn’t bought dish soap or something, but hadn’t. Then I realized that this was a good thing. The slick feeling was the infection dying to the bleach. What was left behind was this slimy stuff.

I sat down and started cleaning out the infection properly for the first time. It took almost a whole package of cotton balls and gauze. I soaked a piece of cotton in bleach and swabbed it inside my bellybutton, waited for the soapy infection juice to form, and then dabbed it away before repeating the process. Eventually it started to hurt again, so much that I cried sitting on my bathroom floor, but I did it. I did it and I am still so proud of myself, because I killed the infection. By the time I was done, there was no more pus left at all or scabbing or anything. It was just pure red blood oozing from what had been a horrible infection, and for the first time in months, I felt clean. I bandaged up my bellybutton one last time, leaving the bleach-soaked cotton ball shoved inside it to kill any lingering infection.

That was last night. This morning when I pulled the gauze out of the wound, I saw something in the mirror deep in my belly button. It was a pale bump, and I knew immediately what it was: the root cause of the infection. The thing that had caused all my suffering.

I grabbed my belly and squeezed it, making the infection bulge outwards. I held it with one hand, and with the other I reached in and pinched at the thing. It was soft to the touch and hot too, like it was feverish. I felt a twinge deep in my guts. I got a good grip on it somehow and pulled. I expected it to be stuck or something, but it came right out. It was a long pale rope of flesh. I pulled the loop out maybe a half a foot before I stopped and just stared down at it. It wriggled there, pulsated almost. It was way bigger than I was expecting it to be, but for an infection this bad, I shouldn’t have been so surprised.

I realized what had happened and why my belly button had been so infected up until now. When I was a baby and my umbilical cord should have been cut and tied off, somehow it had ended up inverted and inside me instead. My whole life it had been just hanging there slowly festering until it finally started rotting in earnest, and my infection was the result. I don’t know how this happened or why, but it’s obvious what I need to do now.

I already have a plan. I’m going to tie off the umbilical cord as close to my body as I can and then cut the rest off. I’ve even overcome my fear of knives enough to get the right tools for the job online. They should be here in a few days. Before then, I really need to know the right way to tie off an umbilical cord. I haven’t found any good resources for that part online, so I thought I would ask here. Does anyone know how to re-tie a belly button?
