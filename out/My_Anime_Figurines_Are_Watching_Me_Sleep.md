I’ve never been much of a “people” person. I grew up in a small town where everyone knew everyone’s business. I heard the snickers behind my back, how my dad had run out on my ma. The prevailing theory around the schoolyard was he left because I was a weirdo with a lisp and greasy hair. The adults were more subtle in their cruelty. 

“*Oh, I bet if you stopped hunching so much, you’d be a strapping young lad.*”

was one I heard a lot. I didn’t care about any of that, though.

I had my anime.

I remember the first show I ever watched. Channel 22 was local news most days. Lenny A, whose hair piece seemed to devour more and more of his scalp with every broadcast; would bray on and on about local politics and the weather.

But Saturdays? Channel 22 was for the boys.

I would wake up at the crack of dawn and race down to the den and plop myself down in front of the soapbox. I would crank up the toons and space out while I scarfed down whatever bowl of concentrated sugar my mother had bought that week. After a time she would peek her head into the den, I would have to shield myself from the rays of sun that came with her intrusion.

“Honey, don’t you think you’ve watched enough TV today? It’s beautiful out, why don’t you head to the beach and play with your little friends.” She said in an ear gratingly sweet tune. 

“You know the sun makes my rosacea flare up, the doctor said so.” I responded, my gaze not leaving the hypnotic visages of cartoon bunnies. 

“Yes dear.” My mother smiled and silently closed the den door in defeat. With that annoyance dealt with I could enjoy my programs in peace.

Then something new, a parade of flashing lights and piercingly high voices. A skinny girl with twin-tails and a schoolgirl outfit danced onto the screen. She flashed a smile and batted her oversized, oval eyes at me. 

 I was hooked. 

My love affair with the Eastern arts ballooned from there. I collected as much merch as possible to share my passion with the world. I’m talking about ill-fitting shirts and out of print collector’s edition DVDs.

My fellow students did not take kindly to my new hobby. I was met with disgust and vicious mockery. I was branded an outcast for life so quick they didn’t even clean the wound. But I didn’t care. 

I had my anime. 

Highschool came and went, and I was finally free to stay at home and search for new releases. Money was no object, whatever my mother refused to pay for was covered by my part-time job that was mostly remote. It was just making cold calls, but it paid a hefty amount. Eventually I got an auto-dialer to make them for me, and I focused one hundred percent of my time on my shows.

That idea worked too well actually, I was eventually rewarded employee of the month and offered a full-time gig at the call center. I declined naturally and was simply given a pat on the back and told to keep up the good work.

Time passed, and my shrine to the East grew. I began collecting figures of certain characters. The first was that twin-tailed beauty of course, but she was joined by the rest of her squad soon enough. There’s something so delicate to these figures, often frozen forever in a single PVC filled pose.

I handled each and every one with care, my room was adorned with them. I started with a single display shelf. My father had built it for me when I was young, no doubt holding on to a ridiculous notion I would fill it with various athletic accolades. 

The moon warrior was placed there with care, her sturdy plastic smile forever brightening my day. I would admire that altar nightly, though I soon grew bored with the same dead eyes looking at me though, so I moved on to the next show, and collected more.

Soon my room became a resin temple, adorned on all sides by nine-inch anime girls. At first, I tried to organize them by show, but as it became more and more about praising my waifus, I decided to keep my favorites close to me. I slept on a king size mattress surrounded by my queens. 

But I suppose you aren’t here to hear about my hobbies, you’re here to learn about its ruination. 

It started after my latest purchase. I had been in a bidding war for a rare-swimsuit variant Eva figure. It was close but I had out bid *“Byer\_Tuck*” by about seven dollars. I was feeling pretty pleased with myself, despite the flood of furious DMs by Tuck.

*“You slimy little shit how dare you.”*

*“Can’t let me have just one thing you disgusting hoarder.”*

*“I’ll get you for this, one way or another.”* 

At the time they didn’t bug me, I thought them a tad melodramatic. Though I had been known to fly off the handle myself if I lost one of my girls to another. But when my prize arrived, I noticed something was off.

There was a little bit of Askua’s arm chipped off, right near her shoulder. My heart sank, I had been gipped. Disappointed, I put Askua in the back with the rest of the defects. My fallen idols, as it were.

Tucked away near my closet was a small shelf for the ones missing paint or were damaged goods. I took a look at the island of misfit toys and shuddered as I did, the amount of money I had wasted on these rejects.

Ah well.

That night I tucked myself in after a long day of catching up on *Goblin Slayer* and drifted off to a restless sleep. As I entered la-la land, I thought I heard a soft giggle. I jolted awake, blinking the weary out of me as I looked around for the source of the faint noise.

There was nothing but thousands of tiny shadows surrounding me.

Usually, the sight of my idols was a warm comfort but in that late hour, I felt disturbed at their lifeless gaze. Painted eyes stood watch over me, and I felt an aura of disgust around them.

I tried to push these feelings out of my mind, focus on getting some rest. As I slept I heard hisses and shrill laughter. Cruel whispers directed at me, encircling me like a siege. 

*“Look at him. Watches cartoons all day like it’s his job.”*

*“His skin is ghostly pale, yet so blotchy, ick.”*

*“I swear if I have to watch him fiddle with his little joystick one more time-”*

*“-Least you aren’t in the splashzone.”* 

*“-ugly little man, should just put him out of his misery.”*

*“Hold him down-and stick it to him.”*

This went on the whole night, the conspiring voices. Every time I moved or snored the voices would hush up. There was nothing but them, my tormenting goddesses. Surely they couldn’t be mocking me, they were different. They were all I had. 

I awoke the next morning to a light knock on my door. Ma poked her head in, her hair a fraying silver, and winced as she saw me.

“Ray honey, do you think maybe you could tidy up a little around here? It’s. . . starting to smell like eggs a little.” 

I rolled my eyes at her and heaved myself away from her judgment.

“Later.” I said through wheezed respiration, my body struggling to awake. 

“Ok honey. Love you.” She said in her condescending way. I grunted in response as she left me shrouded in darkness once more. Eventually I climbed out of bed and studied my surroundings. My floor was cluttered with discarded laundry and half filled bottles. My desk was covered in a cavalcade of wadded up tissues and crinkled bags of chips.

I failed to notice any foul scent and decided Ma was just being her usual neurotic self. I flipped my auto dialer on and watched some *Monster Museum* to pass the time. Out of the corner of my eye I noticed; some of my girls were missing. I leapt to my feet, my frantic steps thundering across the sea of clutter.

I was missing my twin-tailed queen, as well as Mai and Faye. Had ma come in here during the night? She was always shooting me disapproving looks about my collection.

In my search I kept hearing this clattering sound; like something was scurrying around in the walls. In a huff I stormed out of my room and raced to confront ma. I found her doing the dishes, and she flinched when she saw me angrily sputtering. 

“W-what’s wrong hun?” She said, forcing a cheerful smile.

“Did you go into my room while I was sleeping?” I accused. “I’m missing pieces of my collection.” She gave me a vacant look in response. 

“No dear I know how much you value your-private time.” She stuttered at me, avoiding my scornful look. She was lying, that’s why she couldn’t bear to look at me. I smirked at her pitiful display. 

“Right. They better turn up. That’s all I’m saying.” She recoiled at my words and I left her to toil in the sink. When I entered my room I was greeted by a sharp pain in my ankle. I screamed and batted the ground with a frantic swat as I hopped over to the bed.

I heard the pitter-patter of tiny toes scrambling across the floor as I did. I flopped down, the bed cried out in mournful pain. A blotch of red had bubbled up on my ankle, the wound already turning a purple hue. I scratched at it and wiped it off with one of the crusty socks lying around my bed.

Satisfied I looked around for my assailant. I could hear it scuttling about like a roach. Taking a quick glance around the room, I noticed more of my shelves laid bare. The remaining idols stood there, their glazed over faces mocking me in their eternal grins.

I spent the rest of the day searching for my missing figurines. I didn’t find them of course, and it seemed like every time I turned around more would up and vanish. I turned in early, convinced a good night’s rest would clear this whole mess up.

The voices started around midnight. They were all around me, chattering nails in my ears. They were laughing at me, boasting about their liberation. I tried to get up and confront them but I couldn’t. I was paralyzed. All I could do was stare at the ceiling, as the squeaking voices closed in. 

*“The way he talks to that poor woman, really burns me up.”*

“All that money, and he spends it on us instead of helping her.”

*“Doesn’t even appreciate us, he’s chucked half of us away to the corner of shame.”*

*“My hair wasn’t quite the right shade of violet, guess that means I wasn’t good enough for the big shelf.”*

*“Big shelf for the big boy.”*

*“We’d all be better off-”*

*“-cut him, cut him now-“*

*"Hehehe just tie a little knot-"*

*“Yes, yes tonight-”* 

The vile things gleefully applauded my coming demise. I still couldn’t move; I felt coils strapped around my plentiful forearms. I struggled in vain against perfectly wrapped strings of rope tying me down. I could feel belts of oppression slapped against my bulky frame.

All around me were impish figures shrouded in inky silthoues. They varied in size and girth; I could hear them whisper to each other as they crowded around. I could hear them scuttling like vermin in the walls around me, like frayed fingertips on the board their plastic claws burrowed deep.

One of them jumped onto my belly, I saw the ripples flow, and it clopped towards me. It was a figure of a voluptuous centaur, her golden hair flowing in a static pose. She wielded a makeshift spear made of a crocked paperclip and a rusty nail. She held a stern expression on her face, this sculpted beauty. The resin crowd cheered at her arrival, chanting her name like a gladiator of old.

I raged against my binds to no avail as the centaur strolled towards me. All around me were high-pitched voices consumed with bloodlust; "*KIll-kill-kill*" they chanted. In the corner of my room the broken ones were thunderous in their cries. Their wiry frames and exposed parts jiggled as they cheered my would-be assassin on.

My face strained as with all the strength I could muster; I yanked my doughy wrist against my restraints. I could feel the burn as they dug in, staining my flabby tissue with carpet burns and bruises. With a cry of thunder, I finally pulled free, the snap of my liberation echoing in the dank bedroom.

The centaur paused its advance, but only slightly. I lunged towards it as I pulled myself forward; the restraints falling to pieces as the crowd hissed and scattered.

It was then I realized how much they had been corrupted and change. Their faces remained the same, yet evil and carnage radiated off their preserved visages. Their oval eyes moved on their own, rolling around their bulbous heads as they scuttered around the walls. They clung to the wood paneling like their faux lives deepened on it.

I could hear them tunneling in the bones of my home.

I grabbed the centaur and winced as it dug the tiny spear into my flesh. It was a feeble yet determined attempt. Each blow a little prick that oozed crimson, as she struggled in my grasp. I tanked the assault and whipped the centaur against the wall.

She hit with a hideous smack and limped to the ground. One of her legs had popped off the frame and she was struggling to get up; cracks forming her once magnificent body.

I stared at the display wordlessly; my heart beating faster than it had ever my entire life. I glanced at my wrist and saw the deep burn that had embedded itself. I stumbled out the bedroom and waddled to the bath, hoping there was still some cleaning alcohol.

I could still hear them, the scratching the walls only intensified as I scrubbed my hands raw in the basin. They were all after me now, all cramped in the walls like a raging river. I could hear their voices crystal clear in my ear.

*"I'd like to feed him to my harpies."*

*"So mean to us, we just wanted to play."*

*"Vile villain, you'll toil away in the afterlife for this."*

*"We're gonna get you Ray, watch your back."*

"SHUT UP." I finally screamed at the wretches. The voices laughed at my rage and taunted me further. That damn scratching was infuriating; it was like they were termites chewing away at the life of the house. If they tunneled deep enough, they'd collapse the place on me.

"Ray, is something wrong dear." I heard ma weakly call from her bedroom.

"Go back to bed ma." I roared at her. I was met with silence as the voices denounced my treatment of her. I stormed back to my room and slammed the door. I spent the rest of the night, and every night since, watching the walls.

The shelves are bare for the first time in years; the only thing they collect is dust now. I haven't left my room, I know they'll set a trap for me if I leave. They've said as much.

I can hear the little rascals skittering in the drywall even now. They whisper their vicious lies to me every night. But I keep watch, the second I take my eyes off the walls I know they'll emerge from the paneling and take their cut of meat. Sometimes when I'm drifting off, I'll feel a sharp pain followed by a ghastly giggle.

The sores appear on my back, on my shins; damned vampires the lot of them. they prick and slash whenever they can, a little reminder that I am their prisoner.

I won't let them get me, my once prized possessions. Ma used to knock on the door, begging me to come out. She's hasn't come for some time. For the better, for all I know her knocking was an attempt on my life.

I can hear them plotting, they're gonna spike what little water I have left. I already threw it away, that'll teach them. Despite how dry my throat is, it's worth it just to spite them. I'll hold out a little longer, I'm sure I'll think of something.

The voices won't get me, I'm too smart for that.
