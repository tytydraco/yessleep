To preface this, I don't have a lot of friends at the moment. Or more accurately I have zero friends now if you counted them. At other moments in my life, I suppose it was the same story. I always had difficulty with other kids my age, particularly coming off the wrong way to people. I've always been told how unapproachable I am. And to be honest being told so didn't help me be less unapproachable. It just sorta made me more unapproachable. Like I became worse out of spite or something. Idk. I don't really want to get into why I am because I'm sure you could care less. Thankfully, through all of it, Emily was always there. Me and her, ever since our families introduced us around the time we were in the 1st grade, were attached at the hip. I can't really explain what was different about our interaction. But it just was, we clicked instantly. She was a breath of fresh air from the usual reaction other people illicit in me and the reaction I illicit in others.

Emily, possibly through what I guess was just magic or fate, "got me" like no one else ever did or has since. We did everything together throughout our years. We were on the same soccer and basketball teams together. We always submitted science experiments to our school fair under the same related theme. We ate together. Shopped together. Both of us really liked the same kind of manga and video games growing up as well. We talked about the same things together. Our fears. Our hopes for the future. The things that made us mad. About how other people treated us. About how we felt about the world. About our families and how they frustrated us, how they didn't try to understand us. Best of all we were the spitting image of each other in many ways with subtle differences. We had always been told by everyone, by parents and family, or teachers and such that we could be mistaken for twin sisters. And I loved that, and loved that about her. It felt life affirming every time I thought about it. I often look in the mirror and question why I'm like the way that I am, and why I'm off putting to people. And I wish deeply I could make myself the opposite of who I am for others' sake.

But she made me feel like there was nothing wrong with me ultimately. She looked just like me in many ways, and had made a real effort to reach out to me in a way that I took towards. And it just made me feel like I wasn't "wrong" for existing the way that I did. I just existed, like her, but unlike her existed in a way that wasn't like her. And that was okay, for both of us. I guess what I'm saying is that it made me feel loved in that truly heart warming way that TV shows and anime always tried to trick us into thinking lifelong friendship was going to be like. But I was there for it all the way. I was just glad to find out that a friendship like that was real and not a made up fantasy. We stayed the best of friends through middle and high school. Through college, through our internships, through our semesters abroad, and we were both so happy to find out that we could end up working our first jobs out of college at the same place. We both got hired to work as consultants for the same energy firm in the Southeast. I was happy again that she would be there for me, and that again I wouldn't have to bear the pain of getting used to a new place, a new way of having to do things around others.

And then tonight happened. She texted me out of the blue. She usually does, and I always love that because it's like being suddenly sucked into another adventure by my best friend all the time just when isolation, loneliness and other things I'm feeling start to creep in too deeply. She was at the local pond that was shared by our two apartment complexes. She told me the geese were walking their little goslings around the perimeter of the water and wanted me to come watch with her and feed them. And of course, I snapped at the opportunity to watch cute baby geese with my best friend on a lovely, calm night. And for a time it was good, and the little goslings were silly and adorable following around the big geese all awkwardly like they do. I watched their little reflections dance in the water back dropped by the moon's cascading and rippling image portrayed in it. And I smiled as we laughed about the stupid things at our new job and the difficulties we've both mutually encountered dealing with the other people who work there. And then she put her hand on my knee and broke my concentration on the comfort I was feeling in that moment with her. And I looked at her as she said "Hey hun, you know I'm not really here right?" with this sweet, understanding, and empathetic smile paired with the same reassuring eyes that had befriended me all those years ago.

I murmured something desperate and unintelligible out of my lips. I felt strangely panicked but utterly exhausted sitting there on the public bench with her. I felt like I had been grasping at something my entire life like a rat on a wheel, only it was a feeling which had overtaken me suddenly as though I had always known and felt it even though this was most certainly the first time I had ever reckoned with it. And I stared at her. And stared at her. And stared and stared. And the blank air mixed with the night's backdrop that surrounded us overtook where she had been. Where her face was now slowly stood nothing. Where her hair used to dangle right in front of me so close I could reach out and bat it away like a cat, now stood still oxygen and an empty seat beside me. There was no hand on my knee. And there had never been. She faded out until transparency over took her, and then just to be extra cruel to me reality made sure to remind me that there had never even been any such transparency because there was nothing to make transparent to begin with.

She was gone, and I wanted to cry. And I did, for a very long time until the goslings and their mother came to me wanting bread I did not have to give them since she was the one who had brought it originally. And I felt sorry for them because of that, and I guess more so for me, which is selfish but I did. I was angry. I was dead and dying inside. I was aching. And I was tear stricken. I messaged my mom and realized something for the first time in my life I wish that I had realized far earlier. My contact that is labeled as "Mom" in my phone is not my mom's phone number. Or better yet the mom that I thought was "Mom" never had a phone number because like Emily she never existed. And that same logic can be extended to my father, my brother, sister and other immediate family members due to the same following reason. The phone number listed as "Mom" in my phone is and has always been the number belonging to Emily's mother.

And this is for the simple fact that Emily's mother has always been my mother. Emily's father has always been my father, and so on. You get me. And I always knew this, I just chose to never acknowledge it as fact. When I said me and Emily had been introduced at a very young age to each other, the reality was (as I realize it has always been now), that when I was very young I made up Emily as an imaginary friend that was so real to me that my family had encouraged me to truly think and continue to think of her as real. And through all that encouragement, I was able to repress the subconscious part of me that knew it was fake. I had created a family of "lesser" people who I thought weren't as great as my real parents because I knew that being the off putting, weird, and unliked daughter of such a happy and admired family didn't make sense from a superficial point of view. I suppose looking back on it now, it's a point of view they shared.

And for a while, I guess it worked. I'm not angry at them. I'm only sad now that it stopped working and desperate to know why it did. Why my friend disappeared, why I did it to myself. Why I let the one person who made me happy all my life slip away. And now she's calling me. That woman. The one that birthed me and encouraged me to believe I wasn't hers, but instead the daughter of someone imaginary. Someone who it made more sense for someone of my caliber to be born out of. And I don't pick up. I'm just staring at these two little goslings here curling up next to each other wishing I could imagine myself as one of them. It stops ringing and I'm looking at the text message I just got. "Emily are you there? Did you tell her? Please call me NOW please before you do anything." It says. Thank you. I miss you. And I don't know why you had to go, and I wish you didn't. But the fact is that you're now gone and I can't have you back. But you did something for me in your own way, in a way that I'm sure you felt could help. Like I said, thank you.
