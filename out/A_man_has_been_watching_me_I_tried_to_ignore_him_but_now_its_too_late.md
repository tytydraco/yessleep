My name is Silas, and for the past few weeks, I’ve noticed a man standing at the end of the street, just outside my view. At first, I thought it was a neighbor or maybe someone passing through. But he’s always there… watching. Every day, he has gotten a little closer than he was the day before. Every time I saw him, he was in the distance, standing perfectly still. He never moved when I was watching, but somehow kept creeping toward me during the night… the sunrise revealing his slow, inconceivable movement… always unsettlingly closer… his presence more foreboding with each passing day. He stands there… staring at me. I’ve tried to ignore him… to convince myself it’s nothing. But now he is so close that I can’t sleep anymore. I can feel his gaze pressing in on my soul. I’m not asking for help… I only ask that you heed my warning. I am putting myself in immense danger by writing this. Please read my story and hopefully learn from it.

It all started around the time I dropped out of college... a time filled with drunken escapades. Two years of squandered potential and broken promises created a rift between my family and me, tearing at the seams of an already rocky relationship. I had a childhood filled with fuckups and bad grades. I grew up in my brother’s shadow, who was perfect at pretty much everything. His name is Stephen. He moved away after he graduated from college, never looking back. I envied him for that. I don’t think I received more than a C in anything compared to his A’s and A+’s. My parents had paid people in high places to get me into college like my brother, and all I did was fail them. Ultimately, I was expelled from school. I couldn’t live up to their expectations. It was because of my own insolence and self-righteous behavior that my parents disowned me. My dad was harsh about it… I knew he would be.

“Find somewhere else to go, you are no longer welcome here.” My dad said, his eyes bloodshot with rage. “Your mother and I have nearly bankrupted ourselves to send you to college, and this is how you repay us? Get your shit and get out.”

He angrily stomped down the stairs to where my childhood room was. I could hear crashes and bangs from the stairs as I sat on the living room couch in shock. My whole life had been swept out from under me, and I had to accept it. It was my doing after all.

Dad stomped back up the stairs carrying handfuls of old CDs and posters. He was even nice enough to grab my favorite bong. He threw everything on the floor in front of me, waiting for me to say something in response. I stayed silent as he laid into me.

“That’s not all of it, but it’s a start.” He said, “You have until tomorrow at noon to get everything out of here, and if it’s not… it’s going in the fucking garbage.”

He leaned down so that his eye line met mine.

“I told your mother we didn’t need another kid… but of course, you came anyway. Your brother is ten times the man you will ever be.”

I pulled my stare from the floor, leveling it into my dad’s eyes. They were cold and sharp, like the eyes of a shark eyeing its prey.

“Don’t worry, Dad, I’ll leave and never bother you again…” I said in a defiant tone, voice trembling. “Once I’m gone, you’ll no longer have to live with your mistakes.”

His eyes widened as he leaned back, now standing upright.

“You little bastard!” He yelled as he brought his left hand across my cheek… his wedding ring rattling my teeth.

I fell across the couch, holding my face.

“I fucking hate you.” I whimpered in a painful moan.

“The feeling’s mutual.” He responded as he walked out of the living room.

That night, after my mom returned home from work, I pleaded to her for leniency. I desperately asked for another chance… to let me at least show her that I could change my behavior.

“I can change, Mom.” I pleaded, “Just give me another chance to make things right.”

“I’m so sorry, Silas… I love you, you know that!” She said, “But… but this is for the best.”

It felt like all the air had been sucked out of the room. She began crying softly, having delivered the killing blow to my already dying hope. Sitting across from her, all I could do was stare into the burled wood of the dining room table. Following the swirling pools of woodgrain with my eyes, my mind drifted into thoughts of suicide. Maybe if I were no longer here, then she would feel bad for not giving me a chance. Maybe dad would feel something… anything.

I climbed into bed, pondering how I would end my life. I thought about what it would be like if it all just went black. Would it hurt? Would it last long? I had so many questions running through my mind about something that seemed so inconceivably awful to do. I had run out of options… this was now my only outlet.

“Maybe tomorrow, I’ll do it,” I muttered to myself as I lay looking at my bedroom ceiling.

My mind wandered on as my eyes became heavy and finally closed. I felt sleep’s warm embrace flow over me… pulling me into a brief respite. It was suddenly halted by a sound rattling against the window. I felt my senses return as I opened my eyes, glancing over at the windowsill. I could hear a tapping noise. It was light, but rhythmic. It sounded like someone was tapping out a song through their knocks.

Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap… Tap… Tap… Tap.

The sound repeated over and over. I climbed out of bed and walked over to see what was causing the noise.

As I peered out the window, the tapping ceased. I looked in all directions as far as I could, but there was nothing to be seen. I looked across the yard and into the street. I instinctively followed the road with my eyes, looking further down toward the edge of the neighborhood. At the limit of what I could physically see from my window, there was a streetlight shining down on the cold pavement. Underneath its glow was a small, black shadow. Intrigued, I focused on the shadow, squinting my eyes trying to make out what it was. As my eyes adjusted, I could see that it was a person who seemed to be wearing a tall hat. They were barely visible but unmistakably staring at me… I could feel it.

I felt a strangeness crawl over my mind. My consciousness was commanding me to look. I could feel a burning sensation spread across my eyes, as if the person’s gaze were burning my corneas.

“Who the hell is that?” I asked myself.

I stood at the window, watching them… waiting for them to move. The intense staring made my eyes heavy. I blinked to refresh my vision, re-focusing on where the person stood. They were gone. In the time between my eyes blinking, the person had disappeared completely.

With the person no longer visible, I was snatched out of my trance. I scanned the road, back and forth, looking for any trace of them. Now, with nothing there, my senses dulled once more. As I felt sleep curl its way back into my brain, I climbed back into bed… the mystery of the figure’s gaze having taken my full attention… pulling my mind away from the dark thoughts of ending my own life. I no longer contemplated suicide. Every synapse in my brain flickered with thoughts of who that person was… why were they there? Why were they staring at me? I watched the window from bed for as long as I could. The tapping had subsided, leaving silence in its place. I drifted into a deep slumber… the image of the black figure still hovering in my mind.

The next morning, I was startled awake by a loud clattering noise… the vision of the man having long faded from my mind, now replaced with chaos. My dad was grabbing my things and throwing them out of my room and into the hallway. When he saw that I was awake, he didn’t hesitate to let me know what was happening.

“Good, you’re awake.” He said, “Now get your ass out of bed and carry the rest of your shit out of here.”

I sighed with discontent as I got out of bed and began gathering my things. I had not even had a shower or brushed my teeth, and yet I was already being pushed away. Mom walked in and hugged me, trying to comfort me.

“I love you, Silas. Please never forget that I love you,” She said, her voice trembling, “And never forget that you can always call me if you need anything.”

Her words felt so empty… so hollow. I heard ‘I love you’ but just felt betrayed. Mom was supposed to be there for me. My dad, on the other hand, had always hated me. I expected this from him.

At noon, I was on my own. There was no send-off for me. They stood on the porch as I backed out of the driveway. Mom started crying and retreated into the house. A smile curled around Dad’s face as he waved and yelled,

“Good luck.”

“Fucking prick,” I said through gritted teeth.

I put my old 2002 Accord in drive and headed toward the only person I knew I could still count on… Rob’s house.

Rob was a good friend of mine whom I had met during my short collegiate stint. He was a junior when I started as a freshman, so he was able to get me into bars and places that only the older crowd knew about. He had taken me under his wing. He was truly a good friend… albeit a terrible influence. He was partially to blame for why I had been kicked out in the first place. I called him on my way to his place to catch him up on the situation.

“Hello?” He said as he answered the phone.

“Yo, Rob! It’s me, Silas. I need to crash at your place for a little while… if that's cool.”

“Silas! What’s up, man? No problem at all, what’s going on?” He responded.

I could hear how hungover he was by the sound of his voice… but I knew he would help me.

“Long story, man, I’ll explain when I get there.” I told him, “Be there in ten.”

I arrived at Rob’s place, pulling into his oil-stained driveway. As he helped me unload my things, I gave him the full story in all of its detail.

“Woah… man that is some fucked up shit.” He said, reacting to my story.

“Yeah, man, I just need to get on my feet, and I will be out of your hair,” I assured him.

“No worries, stay as long as you need. I’m always here, man.” He replied with a smile.

I thanked him for his hospitality. I had thought long and hard about ending it all the night before, and if it weren’t for Rob, I probably would have followed through with it.

The next day, I woke up in an empty house. Stumbling half-awake to the kitchen, I saw a note sitting on the counter. I picked it up, blinking my eyes as I read it.

‘Silas,

Had to run into work. I should be back around 4:30 this afternoon. There are some snacks in the pantry, or some Chinese from a couple of nights ago in the fridge if you’re hungry. Make yourself at home.

Peace,

Rob’

I smiled as I finished reading the note, feeling actually at home for once. I walked around the house, exploring my temporary home. I walked to the back of the house and saw that there was a back door that looked like it hadn’t been opened in decades. I opened it and was met with a literal brick wall. It seemed that the previous owners had once had a back porch or patio but had removed it and bricked over the opening. The house had several oddities like this.

The shower heads were backwards so that hot water was cold and vice versa. Sometimes you had to jiggle the toilet handle to get it to stop filling after flushing. It had its quirks, but I was grateful to be here. I got dressed and headed out to start the move-in process. I was unpacking my car when I spotted someone about three blocks away, standing in the middle of the road.

My attention was now fully directed at this person. I recognized them… It was the person I had seen the night prior… but this time they were closer. Even across the distance, I could make out the tall black hat they were wearing. They were now close enough that I could see that it was a man. He was wearing a black duster jacket that shrouded his black pants… and, of course, a tall black hat. I stood, staring at the man, curious as to what he was doing and why he was undoubtedly staring at me. With a blink of my eyes, the man disappeared, a car now traveling through the spot where he had been standing.

“I think I’m losing it,” I told myself with a small laugh.

I finished unpacking my car and began rebuilding my broken life.

I had now witnessed two instances of what seemed to be the same person staring at me from a distance. It was so bizarre… so out of place, that I couldn’t just ignore it anymore. My curiosity wouldn’t let me get it out of my mind. When Rob returned from work, I asked him about the guy.

“Hey, man. Do you happen to know anyone around here who stands in the middle of the road staring at people?” I asked in a serious tone.

He must’ve thought I was joking because he laughed at me as if I’d delivered the punch line of the century.

“Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? Are you high?” He asked, still laughing at my question.

“No… I’m serious… I need to know.” I responded, not amused by his childish demeanor.

He could see the seriousness on my face and abruptly stopped laughing.

“Oh shit… you’re serious aren’t you?” He asked, his face now scrunched in concern.

“Yes… I am serious. I saw a guy in all black standing in the middle of the street.” I replied, “Today was the second time I’ve seen him, and I want to know if that’s someone you know… the dude has a creepy vibe, man.”

He looked at me, half believing me and half not.

“Nah man, I can’t say that I know anybody that would be wearing that type of stuff… or doing creepy shit like that.” He said as he sat back in his chair.

Silence filled the room once more as I pondered the man’s appearance. I thought I must be going crazy or having a mental episode. I had been going through immense stress lately… it was probably just a manifestation of my pent-up anxiety. I spent the rest of the night catching up with Rob and talking about what the future might hold.

The next morning was a Saturday. Rob had agreed to help me look for a job before he left the next day for a camping trip. We hopped in his car and headed to town, looking for any places that might be hiring. We must’ve hit dozens of spots in town… all of them being dead ends. As a last-ditch effort, we stopped by the library on the way back home. Sometimes, local businesses will leave their applications on the bulletin board for people to find. By a stroke of luck, I found an application for a job at the local bottling plant stapled on the old, crusty corkboard. I filled it out and faxed it over to them using the library fax machine. I was now playing the waiting game. When or if they would call was a mystery, but I had to try.

Rob and I drove back to his house, exhausted from the job hunt. The last couple of days were exactly what I had needed after the shitshow at my parent’s place. I finally felt at ease… like I could let my guard down a bit. The closer we got to Rob’s house, the further and further I felt my mind drift.

“So, you think you’ll get it?” Rob asked.

“Get what?” I asked in confusion.

“The job, dumbass… the one you just put in for like ten minutes ago.” He said sarcastically.

“Oh… uh, well, I hope so… I mean, it would be nice to be able to make some money while I look for a place,” I responded.

My mind had gone elsewhere. I truly felt like I might be losing my mind. Something just felt… off. We coasted down a small hill, straightening out onto a mile-long stretch of road that led straight to Rob’s house. The late evening sun sliced through the trees, casting long, dim shadows on the pavement. The warm breeze swirled a light fog across the road, further disorienting my mind.

As the headlights leveled out, I could see a black mass in the middle of the road, shrouded in fog.

“Hey, Rob… you see that?” I asked, sitting up straight in my seat and craning my neck closer to the windshield.

“Nah man, what are you talking about?” He asked.

“There’s… something in the road up there,” I said, now pointing toward the mass. “It’s a person, I think.”

Rob slowed the car and squinted up the road, desperately searching for what I was pointing at.

“I’m not seeing what you’re talking about, man… It’s foggy as shit.” He said, accelerating back up to normal speed. “It must’ve been a dog or something, but it’s gone now.”

The headlights shook up and down with the bumps in the road, bathing the figure in light. Nearing even closer, I could now see that the figure was a person… it was the man I had seen before.

“Rob! That’s the guy! That’s the guy that I saw staring at me the other day!” I yelled, now pointing and shaking my finger desperately at the fast-approaching figure.

“Where? I don’t see anybody… what are you talking about?” He asked frantically, as if he didn’t see the man standing there.

The man was now dangerously close. He stood, unmoving in the road… staring directly into the headlights.

“He’s right there, man! You’re going to hit him! Stop! Stop!” I yelled, grabbing Rob’s shoulder and pulling.

“What the fuck, Silas!” Rob yelled as he slammed his brakes.

Rob shifted the car into park and began screaming at me. The man was now a couple of feet away from the hood… staring directly at me. My hearing began to fade as Rob’s voice slowly melted into a shrill ringing noise.

My hearing was gone… my heart thudding in my chest. Seeing the man standing so close paralyzed me… an icy grip crawling across my body. Time seemed to slow down as I examined his features. He wore a pair of old, black leather boots… tattered and worn from abuse. His pants were made of old black denim that was torn and faded. They reminded me of the kind that miners and ranchers used to wear a century ago. The jacket he wore was indeed a duster, but it was heavily weathered, as if it had seen a hundred years of travel and use… the leather flapping in the evening breeze. Finally, my eyes made their way to his head. I could not fully see his face due to the car being so close, but I could see the outline of his hat in the light. It looked to be about a foot tall and had a thick brim encircling it.

He stood there, staring at me for what seemed like an eternity. Through the haze of the evening light, I could see small glints under his hat where his eyes should’ve been. I stared into the small orbs of light as they began to shift and twirl as if they were trying to say something to me. My vision darkened, only allowing a small tunnel of light to come through… just enough to outline the man’s figure. My heartbeat grew louder in my head, sending waves of sound across my vision… wavy ripples pulsed around the man’s body. The white orbs put me in a trance. I could not pry my gaze away from them. The small glints grew larger and brighter, commanding my full attention. They were so beautiful…

Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain shoot through my shoulder. I blinked, sending everything into darkness and silence. For a split second, I felt like I was dead. When I came to, the man was gone. Rob was punching my shoulder… screaming at me to wake up.

“Fucking snap out of it!” He screamed. “What the fuck, dude, you’re freaking me out! Stop it, now!”

Having all of my senses come collapsing back on me at once, I tried to answer him.

“What do you mean? I… I had told you to stop before you hit that guy and then… and then…” I couldn’t finish my sentence. I knew I had warned Rob about the man on the road, but the encounter I had after that felt like a strange blur.

“Yeah, I heard you and there wasn’t anyone there, dude.” He responded. “You just fell back in the seat with your eyes wide open, staring at the road… You freaked me the fuck out dude, I thought you were dying or something.”

Rob’s anger had transformed into worry as he sat back in his seat, breathing heavily.

“What the fuck was that?” He asked, “What did you see?”

I sat back, trying to gather my thoughts. I wasn’t exactly sure what I had seen… and I didn’t know how to explain it to Rob.

“Let’s…Let’s just get home and I’ll explain it,” I said, looking over at Rob, still wrapped in confusion.

The rest of the short drive home was made in silence. I had scared Rob so badly that he didn’t even want to speak to me. We pulled into the driveway and came to a stop. Rob parked the car, sitting still in his seat for a moment.

“What was that, man… seriously?” He asked, looking at me with deep concern.

“I… I don’t know. I just saw that guy standing in the road.” I replied, “I tried to warn you and then… and then it all just went… black.”

I searched my mind for a suitable explanation, yet none of what I thought made any sense.

“I guess I had a weird hallucination or something.” I told him, “I think I just need to get some sleep.”

Rob sat with a fearfully perplexed look on his face, as if I had just told him a ghost story. His eyes softened as he let out a deep sigh.

“Dude… please don’t do that shit again… you almost gave me a heart attack.”

I gave him a half-smile and nodded before stepping out of the car and heading inside.

Rob and I didn’t talk about the incident much. I didn’t want to bring it up again either. There was something so… unsettlingly strange about it. I can’t explain it, but… I felt connected to the man… Like he knew me in some way. It sounds insane, but it’s true. The night after what Rob labeled ‘The Attack’ was filled with visions of the man swirling around my mind as I slept. I couldn’t shake his stare… his white, glowing eyes imprisoning me inside my own body.

The next morning, Rob left for a trip with some friends. He would be gone for a week, leaving me alone with the house while he was gone.

“You gonna be ok here alone?” He asked.

“Yeah, I’m good, man,” I responded, trying to reassure him. “Don’t worry about me. I’ll go get checked out if I need to.”

He gave me a concerned look as he turned to put his bag in his car.

“I’ll be back in a week.” He said, “Please, don’t burn my house down.”

“I won’t, dude,” I assured him. “Go have a good time, I’ll hopefully have a job and be looking for a place of my own by the time you get back.”

Rob shot me a smile and slumped into the driver’s seat of his car. As I watched him pull away, my eyes immediately wandered up the road. Amid the mundane Sunday rituals performed by the neighbors, a person in black stood motionless. Squinting my eyes, I could see that it was a man… a man in a black coat… now about a block closer than he had been.

My heart dropped the instant I saw him. As always, he was standing in the middle of the road, cloaked in black, staring straight at me. Rob’s car had just turned the corner, rolling smoothly onto the street. Coming up to speed, he was now barreling straight for the man. My eyes darted between the two… the distance between them growing smaller by the second. I wanted to shout, but deep down, something told me that he couldn’t see him… that he wasn’t supposed to. Rob didn’t slow… He didn’t swerve. I winced, clenching my teeth as the car struck the man’s legs. There was no sound… no impact. The vehicle moved right through him as if he were made of smoke. The man’s figure swirled and trembled from the car’s intrusion before settling back into shape. And still, the man never looked away from me… not once. The car cut through his form like he wasn’t ever real. Yet, there he stood… motionless and unharmed.

As Rob’s car disappeared over the hill in the distance, I locked eyes with the man in black. His stare seemed to envelope me… sending an icy chill up my legs and into my chest. I felt fear gripping my heart as I stared into his pearly white eyes. The seconds passed like hours… each one feeling like its own eternal prison, forever locking me into a staring contest with what felt like evil. He just stood there… staring. For some reason, no matter how hard I tried, I could not break my gaze. It felt like he wanted me to look… he wanted my attention.

My eyes began to tire and burn. I was finally able to blink… a split second of blackness that felt like pure bliss cascaded across my vision. I dreaded the return from blackness… I feared that the man would still be there… closer this time. As my eyes opened, I no longer felt the magnetic pull of his gaze. He had disappeared as he had done many times before. Confusion and fear washed over me as I staggered inside. This visit had scared me more than ever before.

“How can he control me like that?” I asked myself.

I felt so scared and uncomfortable when I saw him, and yet, I could do nothing about it. My body involuntarily put itself into a trance-like state... commanding every fiber of my being to never take my eyes off of his.

That night, I researched cases of hallucinations in people who had traumatic experiences. One particular article caught my eye… it read:

‘Seeing and/or hearing people who are not physically present can be a sign of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and should be taken seriously. If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, talk to your doctor immediately.’

This was it. The article explained exactly what I had been dealing with. I really didn’t want to see a doctor, but if it meant getting rid of my strange stalker… I would do anything.

I called the local ‘doc in a box’ the next morning and set up an appointment. I didn’t see the man when I left, but then again, I wasn’t actively looking for him. He always appeared when it seemed like I was not paying attention or looking elsewhere. In my mind, I told myself that if I didn’t think about him, he wouldn’t appear. I arrived at the doctor’s office and went in for my appointment. Surprisingly, I was brought back fairly quickly. Usually, these places take hours for a nurse to take you to a room. The doctor walked in holding a clipboard, thumbing through the pages. In one fluid motion, he walked in, closed the door, and squatted down onto a rolling stool.

I watched him rifle through the pages on his clipboard for a few more seconds before he looked up at me.

“So… uhh,” He said, looking briefly back at his clipboard. “Your name is Silas, right?”

His white mustache ruffled across his lips as he spoke, his mouth movements barely perceptible.

“Yes… That’s right.” I replied.

He looked me up and down once more, laying the clipboard on the counter next to him and folding his arms across his chest.

“So… What brings you in today, Silas?” He asked.

“Well… I’ve been seeing things.” I muttered. “Things that feel… real. But I’m not sure if they are.”

The doctor raised his eyebrows in surprise, looking at me more intently.

“Can you explain what you see?” He asked. “For example, are these things… people… or maybe objects? And how often do you see them?”

“It’s only one person that I see…” I responded. “It’s the same man every time… I usually see him once a day.”

I paused, squirming uncomfortably. The words felt so foreign coming from my mouth.

“I haven’t seen him today, though.”

The doctor leaned back a bit, unfolding his arms and stroking his mustache with his fingers. His eyebrows furrowed in concentration.

“Hmmm… interesting.” He said, voice low. “When did you start seeing this man? Is he familiar, or maybe someone you know?”

“A few days ago,” I answered. “I started seeing him the night I got kicked out of my parents' house… and no, I don’t know him… he just shows up at random times… staring at me.”

I looked down, pausing for a moment as my brain relived the experience I had with the man the day prior.

“It feels like I can’t stop staring at him... like he won’t let me,” I said in a melancholic tone. “I see him every day, just standing in the middle of the street wearing all black. Over the past few days, he has been getting closer and closer… like he is stalking me.”

As soon as I finished my explanation, his eyebrows lifted… a smile finding his face.

“Ahh… that’s it.” He said confidently. “The traumatic experience you suffered with your parents probably caused your brain to retaliate.”

He sat up straight, raising his hands to help gesture what he was saying.

“Sometimes the brain takes past trauma in our lives and turns them into people or objects that seem so real that you would swear they were in the same room with you.” He said, continuing his explanation. “It’s all just your brain’s way of dealing with the pain… making sense of it.”

He looked at me as if I understood him… waiting for me to say something in response. The uncomfortable silence seemed to last a little too long for his liking as he stood up from his stool.

“You understand what I’m saying?” He asked.

“Uhh… Yeah, I think so.” I replied. “You’re saying it’s all in my head… Right?”

The doctor smiled as if he had made a breakthrough.

“Exactly! See, you get it!” He said in an upbeat tone. “I’m going to prescribe you some medication that will help you deal with these hallucinations.”

He grabbed his clipboard and started scribbling on one of the pages.

“Now, this is not a long-term fix. You’ll need to see your primary physician if you want to continue this treatment, but I can provide you with a week’s supply for now.” He said, scratching the pen across the page.

The doctor handed me a piece of paper with what looked like chicken scratch scribbled on it and ushered me back toward the main lobby.

“You take care now, Silas.” He said joyfully. “Hopefully, that takes care of your mystery man.”

He smiled at me and turned away, disappearing into another exam room. I walked over to the pharmacy counter and gave the pharmacist the paper. She took it and walked to the back, grabbing a small, white bottle. She put the bottle in a paper bag and stapled it closed with the doctor’s paper.

“Here you go, hon.” She said with a sweet voice. “That’ll be ten dollars.”

I paid the woman and headed out to my car. I pulled the bottle out of the bag and read the label. It was mainly a wall of text, including warnings about not operating heavy machinery or vehicles while taking it. I didn’t care. I’d probably end up crashing my car anyway if I saw the man on the way home… pills or no pills. I popped the top off the container and swallowed a couple, hoping that the effects would kick in soon.

I was driving back to Rob’s house after leaving the doctor’s office, when all of a sudden I felt a heavy weight settle across my forehead… like someone had hung a ten-pound dumbbell between my eyes. My eyes started to droop, and my head began falling lower and lower as the feeling intensified.

“What the fuck is in those pills?” I asked myself as I struggled to keep control of the car, swerving back and forth across the road.

My head bobbed up and down as I fought the effects. By the time I made it back to Rob’s house, I had reduced my speed so much that I could’ve walked on foot and made it there faster. I was able to maneuver the car into the driveway and put it in park. I stumbled out of the car into the house, barely making it to the couch before I completely passed out.

For the first time in a long time, I was able to get restful sleep. I ended up crashing onto the couch at 3 pm and ended up waking at 5 am the next morning. I opened my eyes, lifting my head out of the puddle of drool that had collected underneath it. Looking around the room, I was confused as to why the sun was rising when I had just seen it setting.

“Jesus… That shit knocked me out.” I said, wiping my eyes.

My mind was clearer than it had been. The angry thoughts I had about my parents were now gone… along with the thoughts I had about suicide. For what it was worth, I felt great. I wasn’t in the best of situations, but my mind was finally starting to feel safe.

A couple of hours after I woke up, I got to work. Now that I could focus on more than just sadness and anger, I cleaned Rob’s entire house. I felt reinvigorated and full of energy. The thought of the strange man had not crossed my mind, nor had the idea that he might still be out there. A few hours passed, and now that I was finished with cleaning, I thought I’d call the bottling plant to ask if they had reviewed my application.

“Priceville Bottling Facility, my name is Sandra. How may I help you?” The voice on the other end of the phone answered.

“Uh, yes, I wanted to check on my application with you guys,” I said in return. “I faxed it in a couple of days ago and just wanted to check on the status of that, please.”

I heard papers rustling and crumpling across the phone for a few seconds before she responded.

“Ahh, here we go. Your name is Silas, right?” She asked.

“Yes, ma’am, that’s me,” I replied.

“Looks like the manager has marked the application for an interview. He had planned to call you tomorrow to set up a time that works best for you, but we can go ahead and do that now if you would like.”

My heart jumped in my chest… excitement flooded my body. I was so happy to hear those words. I had wanted for so long to belong somewhere… to be a part of something.

“Erm…Y…Yes, I would like to set it up now.” I stammered, answering the woman.

“Ok, great! When would you like to come in?” She asked. “It looks like he has availability tomorrow morning around 10 am or Friday afternoon around 2 pm.”

“I can come in tomorrow morning,” I responded quickly.

“Tomorrow morning it is. Thank you for calling, Silas. See you tomorrow.” She said in a soft and gleeful tone.

As I hung up the phone, joy overtook my senses. I was finally pulling my life back together… slowly but surely. I was proud of how far I’d come. It was only a matter of time before I had a place to call my own. I spent the rest of the day riding the high from the phone call. I found myself smiling for the first time in weeks. For once, I felt like I could enjoy true peace.

That night was so different from the usual that I almost thought I had taken over someone else’s life. By taking those pills, I had set myself free. All of my worries seemed to be torn away by a small, white pill. Right before bed, I took another dose of the medication… only one this time, as the label had recommended. I figured I needed to dial it back a bit so as not to fall completely comatose again. I now had something to look forward to with that interview. I couldn’t afford to sleep for another fourteen hours. I lay down in bed and pulled the blanket across my chest. As I looked up at the blank ceiling, a smile wormed its way across my lips, letting my mind roam free. There was no man in black nor any feelings of dread… There was just silence. I felt the effects of the pill start to kick in as I drifted into a deep, restful sleep.

The morning after my visit with the doctor was… different. It was like the air in the room had gotten heavy, pressing its weight down on me. I sat up and glanced around the room. It looked the same as I remembered, but it felt off… like someone else had been inside watching me sleep. I tried to push it to the back of my mind as I stretched my arms and yawned, shaking off the remnants of sleep. I got up and walked to the kitchen to start my morning coffee. My interview was in a couple of hours, and I wanted to be sharp. It was a job that paid barely above minimum wage, but it was a job, nonetheless. It was the next rung on the ladder of life that I had to climb to reach the heights I wanted for myself.

The coffee machine gurgled to life, pouring forth the sweet essence that kept me going. I leaned against the counter, listening to the comforting whir and letting my mind drift into my newfound happiness. I closed my eyes, taking a deep breath.

“It’s going to be a good day,” I told myself.

I opened my eyes as the coffee machine came to a stop. As I watched the last couple of drips fall into the pot, my mind started to drift again. Something was grabbing me, like a child pulling on my sleeve, begging for attention. I scanned the room, looking for anything out of place. As I turned back toward the front door, I saw something strange that I hadn’t noticed. The living room curtains were open.

I never left the curtains open… ever. I had a quiet superstition that if I didn’t leave the curtains open, then I wouldn’t see him… and he couldn’t see me. I treated the thin fabric like a shield that protected me from the ‘hallucination’ that I was desperately trying to medicate away. I walked over to the window, doing my best not to look out as I pulled them closed. I held them in my grasp for a moment, curiosity gripping me. Deep within my subconscious, I actually believed the medication had gotten rid of the man, and yet, I still couldn’t shake the feeling that he might still be out there.

“What if… he’s still there?” I asked myself in my mind.

The curiosity gnawed at me… I had to make sure. I slowly pulled the curtains apart, keeping my head turned away. Slowly, the curtains peeled away, as if I were pulling a band-aid off of a festering wound… fearful of what I would see underneath. I slowly turned my head to look outside. My heart was pounding… fear overcoming me. I didn’t want to look… but I had to. I had to see if he was there.

I expected the worst as I peeked through the window… my eyes darting down to the sidewalk immediately. I slowly rolled my eyes upward until the driveway came into view… and then the mailbox… and the street. The entire neighborhood was now in view. To my relief, there was nobody to be seen. All I could see outside was a quiet street, still waking up from its slumber. I examined all the small details of the view, finally calming myself down. I looked up the street. The pavement was wet from a recent rain. I had slept so deeply that I had not heard the rain come through… a testament to how well the medication had worked. The only anomaly I could find was a plastic bag stuck in a bush by the front yard, being tugged gently by the wind. I exhaled slowly and let out a nervous chuckle.

“Just my imagination,” I muttered, trying to convince myself that he was really gone.

I shook it off, easily letting it fade away from my mind… another perk of the medication’s effects. I drew the curtains closed once more, chalking the occurrence up to just a bout of forgetfulness on my part. I made my way back into the bedroom and got dressed, putting on the only button-up shirt I owned and a pair of my dad’s old khakis. I had to borrow one of Rob’s belts. Mine had broken a couple of weeks earlier. I looked… decent. I wasn’t going to win any awards, but I was ready and willing to start my new life. I grabbed my keys, hopped in the car, and headed toward the bottling plant for the interview.

The plant was about a twenty-minute drive from Rob’s house. I arrived early and waited in the car for a bit, sipping the last of the lukewarm coffee I’d brought with me. I went over what I would say in my mind. The nervousness crawled over me, fogging over my prepared lines. I looked at my watch… it was time to head inside. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.

“You got this,” I told myself as I exited the car and headed towards the lobby door.

The interview itself went better than expected. The manager was a burly man named Hank who had been working there for over fifteen years. His face was weathered… full of wrinkles and laugh lines. When he smiled, his face curled into what I can only describe as a top-down view of a topographical map… ridges and valleys swirling through his skin. He seemed genuinely pleased as we wrapped up.

“I think you’ll fit in just fine here, Silas.” He said, sticking his hand out toward me.

I shook his hand, his rough calluses scratching my skin. I almost winced from how strong his grip was.

“We’ll give you a call tonight or tomorrow morning,” he said with a nod. “But it’s lookin’ good, Silas.”

I thanked him and walked out… feeling like I had just won the lottery.
