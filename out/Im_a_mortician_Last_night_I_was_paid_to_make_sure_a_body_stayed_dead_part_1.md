Audio Transcript: Dr. Aris Chen, Mortician and Licensed Funeral Director. Personal Log. Date: October 27th. Time: 03:17 AM.



(Sound of a chair scraping, a deep sigh, and the faint, rhythmic hum of the prep room’s ventilation system.)



This is Dr. Chen. I’m recording this for my own sanity, if nothing else. I’m sitting in my office at Chen & Sons Funeral Home. The ‘Sons’ part being a hopeful, and increasingly ironic, addition by my mentor who left me this beautiful, failing business. 



I’ve just finished cleaning up the prep room. Again. The smell of death is usually something I’m comfortable with. It’s a clean, clinical, predictable smell. What’s lingering now is something else entirely. Something ancient and wrong.



My business has been struggling. The big chains with their tasteful beige lobbies and pre-packaged grief counseling have cornered the market. I chose this profession because I’m a scientist at heart; I find a strange comfort in the finality of human anatomy, the predictable process of decomposition. I like the quiet. I like the truth.



That quiet ended three hours ago.



The client, if you can call them that were three men. They arrived in an unmarked van just after midnight, bypassing the main entrance and heading straight for the service dock, which is exactly the kind of thing that sets off every alarm bell in a licensed funeral director’s mind. They were dressed in heavy, dark clothing, smelled faintly of woodsmoke and something metallic, and they were carrying a body wrapped in a canvas tarp.



"Cash," the tallest one said, his voice rough, eyes darting everywhere but at me. "No paperwork. No questions. Just prep and cremation. Rush job."



I quoted them my standard rate for an immediate, no-questions-asked service, a rate I’d inflated by 30% out of suspicion. He didn’t blink. He just pulled out a thick wad of unmarked bills. I saw the glint of something silver tucked into his belt. I told myself it was a very large, very strange hunting knife.



They laid the body on the stainless steel table. It was a man, mid-thirties, pale, almost translucent. The cause of death, they claimed, was a heart attack. But the body was cold, not the post-mortem cold of a few hours, but a deep, unnatural chill. And there were two small, perfectly circular puncture wounds on the carotid artery. I’m a mortician, not a detective, but I know a clean, surgical wound when I see one. I also know a lie.



I was about to refuse to tell them to take their body and their cash and their bad intentions somewhere else when the tall one, the leader, leaned in close.



"Look, Dr. Chen," he whispered, "this body... it died wrong. We need you to make sure it stays dead. You’re the only one in the city who runs a private, discreet operation. We know you need the money. Just do your job. We’ll wait."



Something in his eyes a desperate, weary conviction made me pause. I’ve always been open to evidence, even when it challenges my worldview. And the evidence on the table was challenging everything. I took the money.



(A brief pause. Dr. Chen clears her throat.)



I had just finished my initial examination. No rigor mortis, which was odd for the time elapsed. The blood was almost black, thick, and had a strange, sweet, metallic odor. I was cataloging the anomalies, my professional mind trying to fit the square peg of this corpse into the round hole of pathology, when the lights flickered.



The three men; the hunters, as I now know them were huddled by the door, their backs to me. They were whispering, their hands on their weapons. They were afraid. And then I felt it: a sudden, sharp spike in the ambient temperature of the room, as if a fever had just been lit inside the corpse.



I looked down. The body was still. But the skin, which had been marble-cold, was now warm. Too warm.



Then, the impossible.



The body sat up. Slowly. Mechanically. Like a puppet whose strings were being pulled by a novice. The movement was a grotesque parody of waking, a memory of locomotion. My mind, trained in the absolute finality of death, short-circuited.



The hunters froze. "It's awake," the leader hissed, his voice barely a whisper. "We need wood. Now."



I was still processing. Pupils dilated impossibly so, in the dim light. Skin temperature rising rapidly. And a a shallow, ragged inhalation that shouldn't have exist. 



Then, it turned its head toward me.



It made eye contact. And in those eyes, I saw something ancient. Something hungry. It wasn't the vacant stare of a reanimated corpse; it was the focused, malevolent intelligence of a predator. The teeth filed into needle points, the canines too long, glistening in the fluorescent light confirmed the horror movie cliché I had always dismissed as fiction.



The hunters were in full panic mode. Scrambling. One of them, a stout man with a scarred face, was frantically searching a toolbox. He found a broken chair leg, a piece of solid, splintered oak. But he was across the room. The thing was standing now, unsteady, swaying like a newborn calf, but moving toward me.



The leader saw my position, saw the creature’s trajectory. He didn’t hesitate. He threw the makeshift stake across the room.



"You're closest!" he yelled. "Chest, center mass, don't hesitate!"



I caught it. The wood was rough, heavy, and slick with a thin layer of grime. It felt profoundly, terrifyingly real.



The creature’s mouth opened. A sound, a low, guttural rasp, escaped its throat. It was two steps away. I could smell its breath now, not the sweet decay of the body, but the hot, metallic stench of fresh, unholy hunger.



(Dr. Chen takes a long, shaky breath.)



Everything in my training said this was impossible. But training also taught me to trust what I observe. And I observed this thing die. Then not die. Then stand up and move. My scientific detachment, my rational mind, had been utterly annihilated. What was left was a primal, professional instinct: finish the job.



I didn't think. I acted.



I drove the stake forward.



I can describe it clinically, even now. Approximate angle: slightly upward, aiming for the sternum, the center of the thoracic cavity. Force required: significant, requiring a full body weight transfer. Resistance of tissue: surprisingly minimal, like driving through dense, cold clay, until the final, sickening thud as the wood met the heart.



The sound it made was not a scream. It was a noise of pure, profound surprise, a single, sharp exhalation of anguish that was both inhuman and deeply, tragically vulnerable.



And then, it crumbled.



It didn't fall. It disintegrated. The body collapsed in on itself, like a sandcastle hit by a wave, the tissue undergoing a rapid, violent decomposition. In seconds, where a man had stood, there was only a pile of dust, ash, and a sticky, foul-smelling sludge.



The smell of death that suddenly filled the room was overwhelming. Delayed putrefaction catching up all at once, a concentrated dose of every foul thing I had ever smelled in my career. I stumbled back, dropping the stake.



(Sound of running water, then a brief silence.)



I must have stood there for five minutes, shaking, staring at the pile of organic waste on my prep table. The leader of the hunters, the tall one, approached me slowly. I was still holding the bloody, splintered chair leg.



"You did good," he said, his voice softer now. "Real good. Most people can't do what needs doing their first time. They freeze. They hesitate. You didn't."



He pulled out a small leather pouch from his jacket. It was heavy. He placed it on the counter next to my surgical tools.



"Your fee," he said. "Doubled. For the trouble. And for the discretion."



I watched him. My hands were still shaking. My mind was a blank sheet of paper, all my carefully written rules erased.



"We need someone like you, Dr. Chen," he continued, his eyes serious. "Someone who can keep their head. Someone who understands... discretion. There’s more out there than just the bloodsuckers. Things that die wrong. Things that don't stay dead. Things that ain't never been alive in the first place."



He gestured to the pouch. "We pay in gold. Harder to trace, holds value, and..." he glanced at the rapidly decaying corpse, "...some of our clients don't trust modern banks, if you understand."



I should have said no. I should have run. I should have called the police, and tell them what? That I staked a vampire? That I’m now on retainer for monster hunters?



But I looked at those gold coins. I thought about my struggling business, about how the regular funeral homes get all the normal clients, about how I’m barely keeping the lights on. I thought about the stack of unpaid bills in my desk drawer.



And I thought about what I saw. What I did. If these things are real, if they’re out there... someone has to handle the bodies. Someone has to make sure they stay dead. Someone has to clean up the mess. And who better than a professional mortician?



I told them yes. God help me, I told them yes.



They gave me a number to call, untraceable, they said. And a list of things to stock: silver, iron, salt, wood from specific trees. They’ll teach me what needs what. They said they'd be in touch.



(Sound of the leather pouch being opened and the faint clink of metal.)



I counted them later. Twelve gold Krugerrands. Weight: 12 troy ounces. Value at current market rate: approximately $27,000. I’ve already spent it in my head. New embalming equipment. That roof repair. Maybe even hire an assistant—though who could I trust with this?



Case File #001 concluded. Subject: unknown male, apparent age 30-40, actual age unknown. Cause of death: cardiac perforation via wooden stake. Second death: same cause, administered by this examiner.



I keep looking at the gold. It's beautiful, heavy, and utterly silent. It's the kind of money that doesn't ask questions, the kind of money that buys silence and complicity. It’s the kind of money that tells me this isn't a one-time thing. This is a job. My new job. I’m not just a mortician anymore. I’m a cleaner. A custodian of the final, final death. And the thought, the terrifying, exhilarating thought, is that I’m good at it. I’m terrifyingly good at it. It’s a strange thing to realize. All my life, I've sought order in the chaos of the body, a scientific explanation for every failure of the flesh. But this? This is a new kind of order. A hidden, brutal logic that governs the things that refuse to die. I’ve stepped behind the curtain, and the stage is far bloodier and more real than I ever imagined.



I look around my prep room. The sterile steel, the gleaming porcelain, the precise arrangement of my instruments. It’s all a façade. Underneath the clinical veneer, this room is now a battlefield, a sanctuary, and a confessional. I will have to change my protocols. I will have to stock new supplies. I will have to learn a new language of death—one that includes silver, iron, and the precise angle of a wooden stake. The old ways of embalming and presentation seem quaint, almost childish now. I'm not preparing bodies for a final viewing; I'm preparing them for a final, permanent, and necessary oblivion. The gold is the price of my soul, perhaps, but it is also the down payment on the truth. I will not be struggling anymore. I will be essential. I will be the one who knows what to do when the impossible walks through the door.



I need a drink. Then I need to research what the hell a 'ghoul' is, because apparently that's Case #002.



(The sound of the recording clicking off.)
