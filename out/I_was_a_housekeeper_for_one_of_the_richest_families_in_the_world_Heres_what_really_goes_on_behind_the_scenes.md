This all happened a few years ago. I was too frightened to tell anyone out of fear for my safety, but I’ve since relocated and changed my name. Now, I’m finally ready for people to hear the truth.

I began working for the “G” family when I was 26 years old, and at first it was truly amazing. I used to consider myself middle class, but that was before I met the G’s. Well, Mrs. G to be exact. Mr. G is pretty busy these days, is what I was told. But seriously, these people are rich. I had never seen so many expensive items compiled into one space before. Take Mrs. G, who is really into the arts, for example. She had an entire section of the house cordoned off for displaying purposes only. I think she even had an original da Vinci painting that she bought for 400 million dollars. Anyway, the pay was great. So great that it was basically the only reason I was doing the job. You see, no one ever really knows what goes on inside of a billionaire's house. Most people assume that families like the G’s are away on extravagant vacations all the time, or taking their private jets to meet in discrete locations on a remote island. That’s what they want you to think, anyway. The reality of it all is much, much worse.

Now, I want to preface this by saying that when I started working for the G’s, they only had one rule: Don’t go in the basement. At the time, Mrs. G told me that it was because they were doing renovations. Nothing about it ever seemed out of the ordinary, so when I heard a crashing sound coming from the basement that day, I figured that someone must have been working down there and accidentally dropped something. I had been in the laundry room, which was a close distance to the basement door. So, naturally, I called out to see if anyone was there and asked if they were alright. But no one responded. 

At that point I started to feel a little on edge, but I decided to walk up to the basement door and call out a second time just for good measure. What I heard next was truly awful. It sounded like an animal, groaning and squealing like a pig, but there were moments where it sounded human, too. I tried flicking the light switch to the basement, but the light wouldn’t turn on. I’ll admit that at that point I was terrified, though at the same time something inside me told me that I should go down there anyway. I guess it was the thought of something or someone being hurt and unable to call for help. So, against my better nature, I slowly descended into the darkness. 

When I reached the bottom of the stairs, I felt around for another light switch until I finally found one. I flicked it a couple of times, but it was the same as the one above. I continued forward, somehow not bumping into anything, when I heard the noise again. It was piercing, like whatever was making it was close enough to grab me. In a state of sheer panic, I fell backward onto the floor and, in the midst of falling, took what felt like a stack of boxes down with me. I frantically tried to pull myself up when I felt the outline of a flashlight next to my left hand. I quickly turned it on and scanned the room with it. It wasn’t until I spun around that I saw a big metal door. It was open. 

On the inside of the door were claw marks and streaks of blood, both fresh and old. I took a step forward, and that’s when I noticed it: faintly written on the door in blood was the word HELP. I started to feel my chest tighten, and my breaths were suddenly shorter, when a rush of adrenaline burst through me. I tried to run toward the stairs, but as I turned I was met face-to-face with the most grotesque thing I have ever seen. 

Towering over me was a man, his body distorted and twisted and covered with infected boils. His arms stretched above him, revealing every bone. His muscles twitched beneath his pale skin, and as I looked up I could see that his fingertips were gone; only bone and pieces of muscle remained. In a matter of mere seconds, the man opened his mouth and emitted the same blood curdling squeal as before. Inside of his mouth I could see more boils, and that's when I noticed that his tongue was gone.

Fear took over as I began to bolt towards the door leading outside, and with each step I could hear the sound of the man’s bones crunching under his weight as he chased me. I finally reached the door and began frantically trying to unlock it. With each turn of a bolt I could feel the man getting closer, and as I twisted the last lock I could feel the bones of his fingertips against the back of my shirt. I screamed, then swung the door open just as the man was about to grab me. I ran out into the backyard and toward my car, too afraid to look back and see if the man was still chasing me. 

It was nothing short of a miracle that I made it to my car unscathed. I drove for hours, across multiple states, and didn’t stop until I was absolutely exhausted. I ended up staying at a motel that night. But even though the man was long gone, I couldn’t help but feel like he was watching me. I also ended up calling the police, but they pretty much dismissed me right away. 

Anyway, the other reason I’m finally coming out with this is because Mrs. G was arrested last week. Apparently, Mr. G went missing a few weeks before I started working there, and ever since they’ve been collecting all sorts of evidence on her. It’s all hush-hush, but the rumor is that they found Mr. G’s body in the basement after getting a warrant to search the house. Allegedly, Mr. G had cheated on Mrs. G with multiple women and they were going through a nasty divorce. I’ve also heard the rumor that Mrs. G was trying to get into some elite art club, and Mr. G was her "art piece" entry exhibit. 

I’m still pretty freaked out by it all, to be honest. After learning of the arrest, I swore that I could hear that squealing noise outside my house. And, in the middle of the night, I’ll sometimes wake up and see him staring at me through the window. It's probably just my mind playing tricks on me, though I still can't help but wonder sometimes if it really was Mr. G's body that they found in that basement.
