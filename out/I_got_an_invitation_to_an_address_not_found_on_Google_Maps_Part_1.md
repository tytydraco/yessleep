I came home from work yesterday and did my daily check-the-mailbox expecting the usual junk mail and bills. To my surprise, someone had actually sent me an envelope with formal cursive writing that day. I took it inside and placed my keys on the counter and put on my glasses. Carefully, I opened the envelope to see a fine cardstock letter inside. It read:  
Dear \[I don’t want to share my name\],

We are pleased to invite you to the Casablanca, which we are hosting on Tuesday, 5/5/2023, at 11:00 PM at 1636 Susan Knoll, Branford, Pennsylvania.

You are to come with only yourself, keep all electronic devices in your vehicle. Please wait outside the gates with the others.

We look forward to seeing you there.

Sincerely,

\[Storges?\]

My eyes scanned to the bottom as the name seemed to have been smeared on accident. What I could make out of it is the name "Storges." The address is unfamiliar to me, and I could only possibly find it with the use of the GPS on my phone. With some time to spare, I pulled my phone out of my pocket and tapped the "Maps" app that was sitting at the bottom of my home screen. It took three seconds to load, and then I typed in the address slowly. Normally, there will be suggestions on what the address could possibly be. It started normally until I reached Susan, at which point it came up blank. I felt this was strange, but I kept typing in the full address. At the end, I pressed enter, and the application took a second to load.

Nothing showed up.

I check it again and then match it with the letter. Same exact address. *Maybe there was a typo.* I should have asked myself *why I* would be invited to an event like this, but it didn’t cross my mind until later. I changed a number. Nothing. I typed the address again. Nothing. This had to be a mistake, and I wished it was because I did something I completely regret.

Jump to today, and I am writing this, sitting on cold, dark stone bricks in a withered basement. I brought my notebook with me; that will be explained later. All you need to know is that I am writing this because I am just an hour away from death. I guess, since I have time, I will explain how.

I sat down and got to writing the address in my little journal or notebook. If you are reading this, flip to the last page to find my passwords. I decided to bring it with me to find the address. I walked out the door and got into my car, putting it in reverse. It’s a white 1996 Honda Civic, if you ever need to find it.   
I drove around the outskirts of town for nearly 30 minutes, trying to find any sign of 1636 Susan Knoll. The farther I went, the more dense the forest became, until there were no streetlights. The only illumination was from my high beams peering into the thick of the woods.

A set of headlights appeared behind me, following closely for the last 10 minutes. At first, I dismissed it as someone else exploring the uncharted roads, but as I made random turns down dirt roads, the vehicle mimicked my every move. My heart began to race as I realized I was being followed. In a hurry, I turned down the first road leading to signs of civilization, which was an abandoned gas station.

I pulled up to an old pump, and the follower parked a few spots away from me. A large man stepped out of the driver's side, staring directly at me with a sly grin as he spoke into a cellphone. Within seconds, a dark van with tinted windows pulled up, blocking me in.

Three more shady men in dark clothing exited the van, making their way towards my car. I locked the doors, reaching for the keys to start the ignition. Before I could turn the engine over, a fist collided with my window, startling me. The man outside motioned for me to get out of the vehicle. I shook my head, refusing his request.

His patience grew thin as he smashed my window in with some sort of baton. Unlocking the door, he threw it open, dragging me out of the car as I kicked and screamed. The other men helped force me into the back of the van, where my cries for help fell on deaf ears.

A cloth was forced over my nose and mouth, the sickly-sweet fumes filling my lungs. My body went limp as everything faded to black.

I slowly regained consciousness as a dull ache radiated through my skull. My eyes fluttered open to a dimly lit room, and the pungent smell of antiseptic burned my nose. I was in a hospital room with an IV inserted into my arm, and the steady beep of a heart monitor filled the silence.

How did I end up here? The memories came flooding back in a rush: the mysterious invitation, searching for an address that didn't exist, being ambushed at the abandoned gas station and drugged. My blood ran cold as I realized these "doctors" were in on it, keeping me sedated for some fucked up reason.

Just then, the door opened, and in walked Dr. Ellis, the kindly older physician from my checkup a few months ago. Only now his eyes held a sinister glint, a knowing smile tugging at his lips. "Ah, you're awake. How are you feeling?"

I didn't answer, glaring at him in defiance. His smile faded as he sighed, "I see you've figured it out. Unfortunate, but not unexpected. We couldn't keep you in the dark forever."

I have no idea what he meant but before I could answer, Two orderlies entered, rolling a gurney between them. "It's time for your 'treatment'. Now, are you going to come quietly, or do we have to sedate you again?" Dr. Ellis asked in a threatening tone.

I leaped from the bed, ripping the IV from my arm as I scrambled towards the door. But the orderlies were too quick, each grabbing an arm and forcing me onto the gurney, strapping me down before I had a chance to fight back. "Why are you doing this?!" I shouted as they wheeled me out of the room and down the corridor. They shove a rag into my mouth.  
I arrived in an ambulance; my muscles were sore, and the more I struggled, the deeper the cloth rag went in. Soon, we emerged into a large warehouse, with the smell of mildew and damp concrete lingering in the air. In the center of the room was a giant glass enclosure, and within it, my heart nearly stopped. A massive black spider, bigger than a elephant, scuttled about, clicking its fangs in anticipation. The spider's eight legs were thick and powerful, covered in bristles that looked like they could easily pierce through flesh. Its abdomen was a dark, glossy black that seemed to absorb the faint light in the warehouse.

They wheeled me up a ramp leading to a platform suspended over the enclosure. At the top, they positioned the gurney so I was staring directly down at the hideous beast. It gazed up at me with eight glittering eyes, venom dripping from its fangs in long strands.

Dr. Ellis appeared overhead, peering down at me through a grate in the platform and pulled out my gag. "Meet our generous benefactor. It has quite the appetite, so we keep it well fed." He gave me a sinister grin. "And it simply adores the taste of men."

My blood ran cold as his meaning became clear—they were going to drop me into the pit to be devoured by this monster. I thrashed against my restraints with all my might, the straps cutting into my wrists and ankles.

One of the orderlies leaned over and began loosening the straps, grabbing my arm to pull me onto the grate. Summoning every ounce of strength, I kicked out at his knee, feeling it connect with a satisfying crunch. He howled in pain, losing his grip on my arm.

I flung my unrestrained limb out, my hand closing around something cold and metal—a keyring hanging from the orderly's belt. As the other orderly rushed to help his companion, I hastily unlocked the remaining straps, freeing myself from the gurney.

Dr. Ellis realized what was happening, his face twisting in rage. "Stop him!" But it was too late. I scrambled to my feet, grabbing the tray of surgical tools from a side table and hurling it with all my might. It struck Dr. Ellis in the eye, with blood spurting from his shattered socket.

I ran for the ramp, only to find my path blocked by the orderlies. But they now looked uncertain, their eyes darting between me and the wounded doctor. Taking advantage of their hesitation, I leapt off the platform, grabbing onto a chain netting suspended over the pit and swinging to the other side.

My feet had just hit the floor when an alarm began blaring. The orderlies rushed up the ramp, shouting into walkie-talkies, but I was already out of the warehouse and sprinting into the night, my heart pounding as I ran for my life until I heard a crack behind me... and I fell face-first on the pavement, screaming in pain as my leg suffered a bullet.

As I lay here in this cold, dark basement, I can't help but think back to the events that have led me to this moment. My breathing is ragged, and the pain in my leg from the bullet wound is excruciating. I can feel the blood slowly seeping out of me, staining the stone bricks beneath me. I clutch my notebook tightly, my only lifeline to the outside world, and recount my harrowing tale in the hopes that someone will find it and know what happened to me.

The footsteps above me grow louder, signaling that my time is almost up. In just an hour, they will drag me back to that warehouse, back to that terrifying enclosure, and back to the monstrous spider that awaits me. The thought of being devoured by that creature sends shivers down my spine, but I know there's no escape this time.

My hands tremble as I write these final words, trying to put into words the fear and dread that fill me. I wonder if anyone will ever read my story or if it will be lost to the darkness that has consumed me. I think about the people I've left behind—my friends, my family. Will they ever know what happened to me, or will I simply vanish without a trace?

As the clock ticks closer to my inevitable demise, I hear the footsteps drawing nearer. The door to the basement creaks open, and I see the dim light of a flashlight beam descending the stairs. I can hear the voice of Dr. Ellis, his hatred for me palpable in the air. There's no more time to write, no more time to reflect on the life I once had.

With my heart heavy and my body weak, I am going to close my notebook and hide it beneath a loose brick, praying that someone will find it and bring my story to light. When the orderlies grab me and pull me from the cold floor, I will become a meal for the monstrous spider, and my screams will echo through the warehouse as I am devoured alive.

And so, my story ends here, in this basement of horrors. I can only hope that my words will reach the world beyond these walls. I should of fucking asked: "why a letter?" They lured me out of my house but  they could of just done it without the effort. Why did they take me? 

But for now, all that remains is the darkness, the pain, and the cold embrace of death..
