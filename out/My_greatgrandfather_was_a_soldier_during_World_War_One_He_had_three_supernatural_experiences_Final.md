What follows is the final entry of my great-grandfather’s journal. As with the first two entries, I must again stress that I have made minor changes to it with regards to any information which could trace back to me, but the rest is completely unaltered.

\- - -

Unlike the rather considerable gap between my encounters with those carnivorous rat-things and that awful ordeal with the Hound, my final experience with the weird occurred less than a year after the previous one. It was the fall of 1918, and it was becoming apparent that the war was nearing its natural conclusion. How soon victory would come, nobody knew, but there was a somewhat renewed sense of vigor about us all, perhaps partially due to the torrential flood of fresh American troops.

In any event, as the war progressed, tanks became a much more common sight on the battlefield. I was no stranger to them by this point, having seen quite a few of them trundling their way across no man’s land, but as time went on they became more and more numerous. I even got to witness some tank-on-tank battles a handful of times, and I dare say in some ways it was more horrifying to see those enormous steel brutes fight it out than any supernatural deviltry.

My final brush with the supernatural began during one of the aforementioned tank battles. I was hiding behind some rubble as the thundering of naval guns filled my ears, the percussive sound occasionally disrupted with the staccato of machine gun fire. The Germans had brought a handful of captured MK IVs to fight off our own, and the level of violence was astounding, even for someone as inured to bloodshed as I was. Oftentimes it felt that for us infantrymen we would spend more time hiding than trying to disable the damned things.

I peaked over the edge of my makeshift concealment, rifle at the ready, looking around for any opponents not currently protected by steel plates. There were only 4 or 5 of the German tanks, more than outnumbered by our own, but what they lacked in numbers they more than made up for in brutality. As I surveyed the war-torn ruins, I spotted a gray German war machine opened fire on one of our own tanks with a tremendous boom of its 6 pounder. When the smoke cleared, I could see that the British tank seemed to have been stopped dead in its tracks, fire licking out of the charred husk. I had a split second to notice the German tank’s machine gun aim in my direction, and ducked down behind the rubble once again.

The chatter of the tank’s machine gun quieted down after a few seconds of whizzing bullets, and I suddenly became horribly aware of how easily my makeshift cover could be blown to pieces by the tank’s larger gun. I looked for an exit, noticing a slightly sturdier looking bit of cover a few meters away. Deciding to chance it, I ran out from behind the rubble, sprinting at full speed.

A tremendous explosion from directly behind me made my ears ring, and I was carried into the air by the force of the shockwave, falling upon the ruined ground. Stunned, I could only gaze feebly as I watched the steel juggernaut approach my prone form, seemingly they planned on saving ammunition by simply crushing me to death beneath the tank’s treads.

As I stared helplessly at my oncoming doom, the ruined husk of the British tank started to move again, the barrel of one of its 6 pounders aiming at the rear of my would-be executioner. The gun fired, and there was an enormous, earth-shuddering boom, so loud that I could hear it even through the ringing in my ears. The tank that I was sure would kill me ceased all motion, and I blacked out, presumably from the rather nasty knock on the head I had received only moments prior.

When I awoke, I was still on the ground, covered in dust and bits of rubble. I stood up, rubbing the large knot on the back of my head. Luckily, aside from a terrible headache, I seemed none the worse for wear. The sounds of fighting had ceased, and nobody shot me after I’d stood back up, so I figured the battle must have been over.

I went looking for the rest of the lads, and as I made my search I noticed dozens upon dozens of corpses, both Germans and our chaps, some of whom were crushed into paste under the weight of tank treads. I shuddered as I thought of what could have happened had the tank not fired when it did.

Eventually I finally saw the rest of the company, who seemed to be chattering on quite excitedly about something. As I approached I began to hear more clearly what they were talking about.

“Do you reckon the driver went mad? Good lord, I swear it took out as many of us as it did the Germans?” one man asked, a look of horror on his face.

“It couldn’t have just been the driver, the whole crew had to have been in on it! Otherwise why would the machine guns have mowed down everything in sight?” said another, his arm in a sling.

“I could’ve sworn that I saw it get taken down earlier, a direct hit from a German tank! There’s no way anyone could have survived that” added a third man as he lit a cigarette.

As I was about to ask what they were talking about, an officer, Sergeant Bentley I believe was his name, blew his whistle, and we all stood at attention on instinct.

“Alright gentlemen, that’s quite enough chit-chat” said Sergeant Bentley, “just because we’ve won the battle doesn’t mean we have time to stand around and gossip. Now, as most of you are probably aware, it seems as if one of our tank crews got a bit, shall we say, overzealous.”

“Overzealous? They went bloody berserk!” cried out one of the men, breaking the silence.

“Quiet!” shouted Bentley, staring daggers at the speaker. “As I was saying, they seem to have gotten a bit carried away in the heat of battle, and there were a few incidents of friendly fire. Now, that tank seems to have run off as it were, out into the forest. We assume that the crew feels guilty for what they’ve done, and have chosen to try and flee the consequences of their actions. Therefore, I’m sending out a small team to try and track down the blighters. Any volunteers?”

I don’t know why I raised my hand. To this day, I genuinely don’t have the foggiest idea. But raise it I did, and before I knew it, I and a few of the other lads were out trudging through the forest, following a trail of crushed undergrowth and knocked over trees.

As we first entered the forest, we could still hear sounds of combat in the far distance. However, as we proceeded further into the woods, the far away thunder of artillery grew quieter and quieter, until we were surrounded entirely by silence. After so much violence, so much noise, silence can become more disturbing than the din of active combat.

To our shaken minds, every snapped twig was an approaching soldier’s footfalls, each gust of wind the whispering of orders in a foreign tongue, and every creaking tree was a tank’s engine. We proceeded with painful slowness, stopping frequently whenever anything even hinted at the remotest possibility of an ambush.

After about a half hour, we began to hear the sound of a rumbling engine through the intense silence. We slowed our pace even further, and crept carefully towards the noise, making sure to be as quiet as possible. After a few minutes, we spotted our quarry.

The tank seemed to have gotten stuck in a ditch of some sort. Ordinarily a problem like that would take only minutes to solve, just requiring the crew to get out and use an unditching beam to get the vehicle out. Given how comparatively quickly tanks can move even through the roughest terrain, it didn’t make sense why they would just leave the tank there long enough for us to catch up.

“They must have gotten out and continued on foot, just left the tank here with the engine running”, one of my comrades observed, getting out from behind cover and stepping towards the immobilized war machine.

As he began to stand up, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and I instinctively began to shout “Get back here, man!” 

But it was too late.

As soon as he left the obscuring cover of the brush, one of the machine guns’ barrels pointed towards the man, and let loose a stream of leaden death. Once the telltale chatter of the machine gun reached the ears of the other men, panic ensued. Tension was high, and the sudden sound of bullets whizzing through the air caused most of my comrades to run screaming into the woods. Some were cut down as they fled, but most managed to get out of range into the trees.

I, however, remained in the brush, focused on one of the tank’s doors, the one on the right pontoon. It seemed slightly ajar, and the tank was at just the right angle to where I could conceivably make it without attracting any machine gun fire.

Sprinting quickly, I rushed over to the door, pulling it open all the way and rushing inside, knife in hand. I expected I would need to grab the right pontoon’s gunner and hold him hostage in order to force them to stop firing. It didn’t seem like an easy task, but I didn’t much relish the idea of just tossing a grenade in and killing the lot of them. Deserters, perhaps even traitors they may have been, but I had no desire to kill any of my fellows. As soon as I jumped into the tank however, I was met with a rather different sight than I expected.

Inside the tank, I was greeted by the stench of ash and burnt meat. Seven corpses were scattered about the interior, all horribly burned. The only living person was a young man in the driver’s position.  As soon as I looked about in confusion, he grabbed me violently, wrenching the knife out of my hand and sending it clattering onto the floor. He punched me in the stomach, knocking the wind out of me and giving him a chance to draw his pistol.

“Nice try Fritz” the driver spoke, gun aimed squarely at my head, “but you won’t be able to stop us that easily. We’re going to continue our advance all the way to Berlin if we have to!”

Stuttering, I replied, “What? What the devil are you talking about man? I’m on your side!”

A strange look crossed the driver’s face, almost like he was trying to remember something, before he shook it off and regained focus. “No you’re not, you’re clearly a German spy, trying to convince us to turn around.” He looked off to the side slightly, as if listening to someone, before chuckling and saying “You’re absolutely right Johnson, he certainly isn’t able to fake an English accent.”

I peered over to where the driver was looking, only to see one of the burnt corpses giving a skeletal grin back at me, its lips seared off by heat. It seemed to be partially melted into the floor, and was very clearly dead.

“You’re absolutely mad!” I exclaimed, looking around at the corpses in horror, “Don’t you realize the rest of the crew is dead?”

The driver laughed. “Dead? No no no, you German bastards may have taken out the commander with that lucky shot of yours, but the gunners and I are just fine, and we’re going to take the fight all the way to the Kaiser’s palace.”

As I was about to respond, suddenly I heard the rhythmic rat-a-tat of a machine gun firing. Looking around, I noticed one of the guns was aiming and firing itself, as if being manipulated by some invisible hands!

“Excellent shot Fred!” exclaimed the driver, gleefully.

I noticed for the first time the rather large hole in the tank’s armor, nearly 6 inches across, exactly where the commandeered German tank had struck the vehicle which saved me from oblivion only an hour or so prior. I remembered the flames licking out from the wreck, and realized it must have been impossible for any of the crew to have survived it.

I looked back to the driver, noticing how completely free from harm he seemed. There wasn’t so much as a scratch, or even any sweat staining his uniform. He seemed as if he had just arrived to the war, straight out of training.

There is something inherently unsettling about realizing that the man you were talking to is already dead. We’ve all heard ghost stories, tales of unquiet spirits walking amongst the living, but to see one right in front of you, a man completely unaware of his own death, still walking and talking as if he were alive, it’s completely different.

“Why are you doing this?” I asked, my voice shaky following my realization of what exactly the driver was.

“Why? To win the war of course! I won’t stop until you warmongering bastards have surrendered, till the war is won, till we can finally just all go home!” The driver was practically screaming, waving his gun around like a conductor’s baton.

It was then that I realized what I had to do. “You don’t have to fight anymore. You’ve beaten us. You’ve won. The Kaiser just announced it. The war is over. I was sent to tell you that you don’t need to fight anymore.”

The driver’s face seemed confused. “We won? We did it? It’s all over?”

I nodded, hoping this would work. The ghost, or whatever it was, seemed to think I was a German soldier, so maybe it would believe me. “Yes, it’s all over. The fighting is done. You can rest now. You did your duty, for king and country, and now it’s time to rest. You can go home now.”

The driver lowered his pistol, staring off into space. “For king and country…” he whispered, eyes glazing over.

“Yes, for king and country” I said, trying to keep him talking. “It’s all over, you won. You served well, with honor and courage. Your nation is proud of you.”

A single tear flowed down the driver’s cheek as he began to gently sway back and forth. After a moment, he once again murmured out the words “For king and country.”

As I watched, the young man’s uniform began to darken, then crumble into ashes. His skin started to blacken as his eyeballs burst, the vitreous fluid dribbling down his face, only to evaporate into steam moments later. His hair started to fall out in clumps, crumbling into soot as it hit the floor. In the space of a few seconds, the once lively looking soldier collapsed into a pile of ash and bones. As soon as this was complete, the engine sputtered and fell silent.

I staggered out of the tank, dazed from what I had seen. I called out to the others that it was all safe, that they could come out. Eventually, the other lads came out of their hiding spots, and asked me what happened. I didn’t answer them, I just pointed to the open door of the tank as I began the march back out of the forest.

I never heard an official explanation for what happened with that tank. I never went looking for one. I imagine the higher ups just filed away the report of what was found there, the eight burnt bodies of the tank crew, assuming it was some sort of mistake or a sick joke.

My time in the war didn’t last much longer after that final incident. A few weeks later a stormtrooper gouged my eye out with a knife and that was that. I was sent back home with nothing but a medal and a missing eye to show for my time in the war to end all wars.

I wish I had some explanation for all that happened to me, that there was some common thread linking these three events. But as hard as I try, I cannot find one. I’ve tried to convince myself I was just barmy, that shellshock made me imagine these horrible things, but I can’t. I know in my heart of hearts that my memories of these events are true. I cannot deny their veracity any longer.

I’m going to hide this journal now that I’ve finished writing these accounts. After I die, someone will find them, and maybe the world will be ready to hear these stories. Maybe someone else will put together the dots and figure out what I couldn’t. I only wonder how many others had similar experiences, and, like me, chose never to speak of them.

That is the end of my great-grandfather’s journal. I was unable to verify anything about the final tale, as there are no records of any friendly fire incidents at the battle he described. However, it is true that such incidents are often underreported, and it is often difficult to find accurate records after over a century has passed.

Alas, I cannot find any logical connection between my great-grandfather’s experiences. I do not see a common link between them, nor any rational explanation for what he describes. My only theory is this; perhaps when the world is wracked with constant violence and pain, reality itself is wounded. Maybe when the whole world is drowned in blood, strange things awaken from the darkness to lap it up. When the whole world has gone mad, what does a bit more madness matter?
