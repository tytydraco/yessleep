This afternoon I walked out my front door to have a smoke. I saw two people at the end of my walkway on the sidewalk petting Stella, one of the 13 stray neighborhood cats.


i didn’t really pay attention to who it was. I live next to a foster home for teen boys, so they’re always with their girlfriends walking around the neighborhood petting the cats and whatnot.


 I look up and I see a boy and a girl. The boy was maybe 11 or 12, the girl couldn’t have been older than 13. So pretty young.


It caught me off guard, I had never seen them before. They were looking down petting the cat and they both stared up at me, not friendly at all. They Didn’t say anything. They were both almost glaring at me. Completely dead pan, it’s like their eyes were staring through me. 


I live next to a college for older people along with the foster home, and if I see someone I haven’t seen before petting the cats I say hi to them and tell them the cats names.  


Something didn’t feel right, I just went to the backyard to smoke. About halfway through my smoke I had an inkling to go back to the front door to see if they were still there. They were, 


As I peered through the curtains the girl starting walking up my walkway towards my house, then she knocked on the door. 


 (I know they didn’t see me coming, I can see through the curtains from the inside but you can’t see through them on the outside.)


This freaked me out. I went back to the backyard to finish my smoke, called my husband, told him about the situation, he was confused and like what? You’re scared of some kids? Laughing at me looking at me like I’m crazy, 


I was heart pounding out of my chest shaking kind of scared. a minute later I went to check if they were still there and they were gone. 


 I love when kids come to pet the cats, they get so excited and ask me questions about them and it’s super cute. I also have a child who is 11, right around the kids presumed ages. 
But something inside me told me to run. I’ve never felt like that before. And I get a lot of weirdos and drunks walking down the sidewalk and talking to me and they’re harmless, but some random kids freaked me out? I’m trying to make sense of it, 


Since that happened I have been cautious about going out on the porch. I told my husband to absolutely not interact with them if he sees them. He still thinks I’m crazy. 


I told my dad and he knows me, he knows I’m a rational person. He told me that if my body reacted like in fight or flight mode, there was definitely something wrong. 


My coworker told me maybe I sensed bad intentions from the kids, or something negative attached to them, she is really sensitive to things and has this happen to her sometimes. But I don’t know. 


 So what do you think? Has something like this ever happened to any of you?
