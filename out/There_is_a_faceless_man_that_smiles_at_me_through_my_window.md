There is a light flashing outside my window. It flashes in patterns, and it never turns off or stops. It is methodical. It is the only light outside my window. 
There is a man that looks at me through my window. He is smiling, but he does not have a face to smile with. I live on the 3rd floor. He keeps smiling. I am not sure where I should begin my story, but I will tell it. For today, the man was not at my window. There is knocking at my door. I think it is the man, and I think he wants to greet me finally, with his blank slate face that somehow smiles. 
There is no more ground outside of my window. I no longer live on the 3rd floor, as there are no more floors at all except for the one in my apartment. There is static outside my window. I had a cat once, I think. I also think that the man does not like cats. I do not have a cat.
Will you listen to my story? Will you hear it? Will you save me? Can you save me? I am not sure. For now, I sit and write my finality. For now I listen to the knocking of the man without a face who smiled. For now I will tell you what remains.

I decided to take a break from college at the beginning of the year. It was not a sporadic decision, but a decision that I made to heal after putting myself in the hospital. It was my own choice, one that a lot of people didn't really understand and I didnt have the capacity to explain. I think I was just tired. I think I've always been tired. My family was beside me through most of it, though I lived alone. My dad ended up getting me a cat. Her name was Calipso, and she became my only comfort while getting through each day. I spent most days just at home and going to work. I didn't go out anymore, and I focused on trying to get better. I thought I was getting better. Until that wretched bar. Until he came. 

A few weeks ago, I decided that I would go out. It was a rare night where I decided that I wanted to go somewhere and try to have some fun like a normal 21 year old. I decided to go grab a drink at some bar in town. The bar I went to was one that I hadn't heard of before, but it was the first one that popped up when I searched bars on Google. It had decent reviews, so I chose it. The first thing that struck me as odd heading there was the location. It was a little out of the way, still in town but not really near any buildings. I brushed off my doubts and continued there. 

The bar wasn't very big. None of the bars in my town were though, as it's a smaller town, so once again, I ignored the weird feeling in my gut. The building was brick, the color like drying and cracked blood. Places look like they had been hastily fixed with concrete, the random gray patches standing stark against the dark brick. The windows looked mellowed, though it could have been from the warm lights coming through them from the inside. There were vines creeping up the side, tethering it down and looking like the earth wanted to swallow it. Maybe it did. Walking to the door, I didn't really pay attention to how there weren't any cars or people outside around the place, nor was there any sound leaking out of the frail and shadowed building. I wish I had paid attention. 

The inside was normal. There was music playing, a dance floor, and a pretty nice amount of people given the out of the way place the bar was at. I, at the time, did not realize none of the people had faces. That the way they moved was jittery and odd, like someone trying to puppet a heavy sack of grain or a wax figure trying to move after melting its joints. I sat down at the bar and a bartender came up to me to ask for my order. He had a face. At least I believe he did. My mind is not the same as it once was. I told him the first drink off the top of my head and waited.

That was when he came in. The air shifted in the bar, and my head pounded like all of the blood rushed there. I was frozen, and did not want to look at whoever walked in. My gut told me that if I looked, it would be over. I wish I listened. Footsteps made their way towards me, the sound loud even amidst the bumping music playing. Or maybe it wasn't playing at all. Maybe it never was. The footsteps stopped behind me, and he said something, but I did not comprehend it. It was like my brain was filtering it out. There was a ringing in my ear, and static behind my eyes. I hadn't even drank yet. Had I? Maybe I had already drank.

I turned around.

The man's face was static. My vision was swimming, colors were blending, and suddenly there were flashes of an empty old bar with nothing there but cobwebs, shadows and the things that lurked there. I believe he was one of them. The visions were fleeting and I was back to reality quickly. Or what I think was reality. My current one at least. The man offered his hand and I took it. The static grew. My head was filled with it. We danced. The song was slow. Or was it fast? A fly lands on my hand. It was hungry for the rot that lingered beneath my skin.

I do not know how I ended up back in my apartment, but the man was there. Everytime he spoke, flies poured out, and the static grew louder. Brighter. He left. The flies stayed to keep me company. The next week was a blur, and I am not sure what was reality and what was something he created. Did I ever go to work? Or have I been in my bed the whole time? Has my family come to check on me? Do I have a family? Did I ever have one? The static man came by one day and introduced me to the faceless one. ‘He will watch you until it is your time’ the static whispers. My time for what? The end? The beginning? The man started to watch me. I live on the 3rd floor. I did live on the 3rd floor, right? The man watches anyway, smiling with his empty face. The static man came once more. Calipso, my cat, is gone. I am not sure she was ever here. I do not know if I had a cat. The static man told me it was my time, and the smiling man never came to my window. There is no outside now for him to watch from so it makes sense. There is knocking at the door.

The world has become static, and soon so will I. For now though, I am…

what remains.
