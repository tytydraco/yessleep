This morning is like all the others. I wake up at the crack of dawn, there is no sun shining today, from the window I can see the clouds have decided to settle deep within the crease of this valley like gauze into an open wound.

I stand up, wash up, eat yesterdays leftovers, and put on my raincoat and boots. There are no better days than days like today to leave this house and look at the place I lived in all my life. Only on days like this it still bears resemblance to how it used to be like back when I was a girl, calm and empty. The tired old floorboards creak as I make my way to the door, I put a bottle of water in my backpack and head down the stairs.

Outside the air is so fresh it almost hurts to breathe, like my lungs are forcing more oxygen into themselves than they can reasonably take, it tastes as wonderful as always, the fog lies on me like a wet blanket impacting my visibility but I don’t need to know where I am going. I have walked down this path a million times.

The faint sound of crowds of tourists sound from further up above. Not even early spring deters the thousands of visitors any more, at least they stick to the town, not daring to exit its safety unless the sun shines on them. It took only a couple of pictures of this interestingly beautiful yet oppressive place to change our lives forever. This valley is the gold standard of Switzerland. The locations that pops up first when you look up this countries name. It made many of us so, so rich. Not me unfortunately. I am exited for visitors to show this ancient place to people from around the world. I just wish they would treat it with the reverence it deserved sometimes.

Weather like this keeps the endless snake of tourists contained to the town though. Except for the Germans and the Dutch, they don’t seem to fear the mountains as others do.

The Lauterbrunnen valley a deep cut within a mountains foot. A flat valley cut right into rock, like a God slipped with his finger and carved into the skin of the earth, the valley is less than a kilometer wide, the sheer cliffs on either side are up to 1000 meters high, interrupted rivers up above throw their water deep down into the valley. Cascades that have such a long way down that they loose themselves into the air before they can ever reach the ground to form a river. The forces of nature that it took to make this place are nearly inconceivable. It is an oppressive place. The fog turns the rocks to black.

As I walk along the coiling river, that runs trough this deep scar out of the corners of my eyes I feel like the walls are moving, closing in. Ahead of me I can just barely make out the looming deities of the valley, Eiger, Mönch, Jungfrau. Arguably the most popular mountains in this country. Safe for the Matterhorn of course. A feat of nature turned into a tourist trap. A fitting description for the entire country if I think about it. I feel like these mountains were never made to be seen by this many eyes. They are hostile, angry things we tamed and made docile, we removed the fear of them and what they can do. They have the ability to swallow us whole. They take their sacrifices. Usually, those sacrifices are German or Dutch. They really need to be more careful out here.

But sometimes, they feed on entire towns that rest at their roots. They are still unpredictable, even if we build luxury hotels on their crows. There is a saying among people living in the alpine mountain chain. The “Bergler” comes down twice a year, in winter with the avalanche and in summer with the rock slide. Sometimes, I think it is revenge.

A deep rumbling reverberates across through the valley and stops my track of thought. As soon as it started, it stopped, heart pounding. It's probably a military jet. I laugh to myself. “Or maybe the mountains are hungry again.” I say in a whisper. The Trümmelbach next to me picks up speed as elevation rises and my legs start to gently burn with exertion. I am past Stechelberg now. The cliffs give way to the feet of the mountains up ahead. Gentler slopes, with every meter of elevation the fog dissipates presenting the heavy clouds above. Civilization is behind me, and the landscape is dominated by rock and forest. Soon, the glaciers hugging the Ebnefluh should come into view. It's ever shrinking and beautifully. Gone.

Cruel rock remains where ice should rest. It was just there less than a week ago, winter just dissipated, the snow just started to melt into the valley, how could there be rock where meters of ice were just dying their gentle billion year death? Something horrific happened some inconceivable anomaly scraped the ice from this mountain like a disgusting old scab, the peaks above silent, not threatening, stoic and godlike but frozen in fear like a child in the face of incomprehensible horror. Begging for comfort begging me, a person that understands to crawl up to it and let me share in the terror. I scramble up, up, up I cut through trees and stone like a woman possessed. It has to be a mirage I got turned around somehow on the path I walked a million times before I must’ve gotten turned around. I will get up there and touch the permafrost. I will realize that I am mad.

Without any sense for my safety, I crawl right up the riverbed that connects the glacier with the river. The gentle cascade has devolved into a slope littered with rocks. For millennia, they were gently tumbled by the river that flowed from up above. They are dry and cold now. I walk and crawl over them they stare at me with accusations in their unseeing eyes. I'm looking for someone to blame.

My cut through the unkind wilderness becomes more dangerous, more steep, a gentle misstep would end my journey, I am underprepared I am breaking every rule in the book, sharp rocks shred my hands and knees, I pull myself over ancient stones. Potentially untouched by human hands, if not by human influence. The cold settles deep within my bones. But the mountains are weeping for me. They want me to observe what has been done to them. They need my comfort, my caring eye.

I am climbing the jagged rocks now. Skin rolls of my fingers, wet blood running down under my coat. I drag my body over yet another rock, sharp edges dig into my belly, I pull myself over, knees and feet scrambling for purchase, hands ripping on sparse vegetation for any kind of purchase. The mountain allows me to live, to carry on. It wants me there.

Plants run out of air. Soon, it is just me and violent stone. It is brittle and sharp. I grab it to gain another meter, and it gives up under me. My face hits the unforgiving surface, scraping a deep valley into my lips and chin a gentle river of blood runs down under my jacket. Painting the creases of my skin flowing between the valley of my chest, forming a lake somewhere on my stomach. But the mountain lets me live. Another handhold is a safer stone I put my life on. Before I knew it, I made it onto the plateau.

It is empty. I see a mountain hut that would’ve overlooked the glacier. The windows stare at me. I see their shame.

It surprises me that I have never considered what might lie beneath a glacier except for rock. But it does make sense that it would be a graveyard of bones.

Some of which I recognise. Capricorn and chamois, birds and marmots, human bones littered here and there. Bones of animals that are unfamiliar. Bows,arrows, remains of human life as it has been thousands of years ago. The first explorers as well as unluckytravellerss. Skis and backpacks. Old and new. Empty eye sockets glaring at me,  judging me for disturbing their final rest. Unearthed, released from their graves. I feel their ghosts brush by me in the wind.

My feet carry me ever forward, up and up and up.

There are holes in the floor, sheer drops, round and deep into the depths of the mountain. There is no ice, not even in the abyss. The snow up above is thin. Getting thinner. Yet no water flows down the slopes. My feet slip. I brace for impact, but I don’t hit stone, I don’t drop down an abyss. My handlands on something soft, gently textured, slimy, and oddly warm, I feel around this new object protruding from the ground. Round with little bumps, where the edge of it hits rock, there are holes out of which soft air exits.

I reach into one of the holes, carefully, thoughtlessly. I do not understand what I am looking at, my hand does not even have to chance to vanish within the cavity before the object seizes, a deep angry, sudden noise rips through silence, something shoots up at me flinging me back onto the stone. The back of my head hitting the ground hard. I pull myself back up. Warmth flows down my neck, forming a river over my spine. Another river running down between my bottom, splitting at the back of my legs, forming subterranean seas on the bottom of my feet.

Before me the giant head of a dog protrudes from the ground like a plant, about 9 feet tall, white to the point of translucence, tiny slimy looking scales for skin, breathing heavily now, long snout open, within its maw adorned with rows of needle like, almost translucent teeth. Between the teeth lies a heavy cracked tongue. Dry and painful. The corners of its mouth are raw and red. I stare at it at those horrific teeth, panting mouth. A soft whine emanating from this...animal. I catch its eyes and whine in despair.

Wide open, yellow, and bulging, they jump up and down, fixated on me, afraid and confused. A terrible whimper exits the animals throat. The sound reminds me of the dog my neighbour once had, a terrible man. He would beat the dog with sticks and scream at it. Starve it. Lock in in a crate for days on end. No one ever did something. I never called the police. I should have. I really should have.

This beast looks dried out. Licking at the sky but there is no more ice left. The moisture of the wet sky does nothing to satisfy it. This creature is suffering, I have promised myself never to ignore an animal in need again. This creature is ancient and unknowable new jet inconceivably old and begging for my help...

Sinking down to my knees, I take off my backpack and remove the bottle of water. Slowly, carefully, with an ever rising sense of melancholy, horror, and guilt, I move closer to the spouted head. Its eyes fixed on me. Milky pupil shiny with unshed tears. I reach past the teeth, angling my hand in ways that I might never have to feel them. They remind me of the teeth of a deep sea predator, an anglerfish. They look malleable, but I fear they might be as sharp and hard as glass.

I tip the litre of water down into its mouth. The dog startles and seizes. I drop the bottle down its maw and retract my hand just in time before it clamps its mouth shut. It whines and whines louder and more persistent as it writhes itself out of the hole.

I turn and run, but this environment is as hostile to me as to the animal behind me. I fall, my wrist gives way, and pain shoots up my arm. Two of my fingers immobilized in an unnatural position. My wrist hangs uselessly at the end of my forearm. Behind me the animal is squeezing itself out the hole in the mountain, tiny useless arm spouting from its sides its head is too heavy for its thin snakelike body, the sharp rocks rip its belly open, blueish fluid, blood stains the naked rock, animal bones clatter as I crawl away facing the dog it crawls after me. Still whining. Open eyes still fixed on me.

I come to the realization that this animal is still a child, young, mad with thirst. It doesn’t understand where the water has gone. It may be more afraid than I am. Never has it seen the light before. Never has it seen a human before, but I gave it what it desperately sleeked to survive and recoiled from it.

“I am so sorry, I gave you all I had. I am sorry.”

It ignores its undeniable pain head scraping across the floor. It just barely lifts its skulls for seconds at a time to move closer and closer.

“Stop moving, please, please, you are hurting yourself. Please stop” My voice is thin, shaking. I am pleading with this poor pup. For a lack of a better word, to stop, just stop hurting itself. Its eyes begging me for comfort, for more water.

“Please, I can't help you. I am sorry, I gave you all I had.”

Without warning, there is no more ground to carry me. I descend down one of the crevasses, or it might’ve been one of the pits I did not have in me to notice. Hitting an edge, I feel something in my leg give way, another edge, something in my back gives way. I come to a semi-stop as the passage narrows down. My flesh does not feel one with my mind anymore. I don’t think it has since my mad race up the stone wall. Slowly, I slide down between the tight walls of the mountains bowels. Hitting the jagged floor, my vision escapes me. Odd patterns make up the walls of this cave. Like thick cables, meters tall, tight, spring-locked, and dripping with fluid. Above me, the one gigantic yellow eye watches full of accusations. It uncoils. The walls move up at a rapid pace, up the crevasse.

A deep, loud growl fills the space the animal leaves behind as it makes its way to the surface, making the walls tremble.

She is rescuing her young.

The mountain has swallowed me whole.

God, what have we done.
