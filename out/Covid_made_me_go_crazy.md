Yeah, I’m not gonna lie, this is embarrassing now, but at the time it was terrifying, and I really don’t have an explanation for it other than stress from lockdown.

About five years ago, right before the pandemic, I decided I wanted to finally move out of my parents’ house at 20. I wasn’t having much luck until I got lucky with an ad on Craigslist. Yeah, I know, someone looking for a roommate on Craigslist is shady as hell, but the rent was cheap and the guy was my age, so I went for it.

My roommate, I don’t remember his name now, so I’ll call him Jake, was a super chill stoner type who didn’t get out much. He’d already been living there for a while and was just looking to fill the spare room. About a week after I moved all my stuff in, the world shut down.

I was really stressed about everything, especially my dad. He’s immunocompromised, and I was constantly worried I’d somehow get him sick just by existing. Between that and suddenly being stuck inside all the time, I honestly didn’t notice the first time the light switch moved.

One night I woke up around midnight, still a little high, and realized I’d left food out in the kitchen. I didn’t want to turn the lights on and wake anyone up, so I felt my way down the hall like I’d done a hundred times already. I knew exactly where the switch was.

When I reached the kitchen doorway and felt the wall in the dark, it was bare.

I stood there for a second, confused, then felt along the other side of the doorway. The switch was there.

I figured I’d just misremembered which side it was on. I was tired and it didn’t seem like a big deal. The confusion went away almost immediately, and I didn’t think about it again.

A few days later, my bedroom door opened inward.

It had always opened outward. I remember thinking that was annoying when I first moved in, because if someone happened to be walking down the hall and I opened my door too fast, I’d smack them. So when I pulled the handle and the door swung into my room, I actually laughed.

Then I tried opening it the other way.

There was a loud crack as the screws tore straight out of the wood.

So yeah. I didn’t have a door for a few days.

After that, nothing else happened for a while. At least, nothing obvious. Around that time, I started going outside more.

I don’t smoke cigarettes, but I do smoke weed. I could smoke inside if I wanted to, but being cooped up all the time was getting to me, so sometimes I’d step out front just to stand there for a few minutes and smoke a joint.

That’s when I noticed it felt like it took longer to get to the front door.

At first I thought I was just tired. Or high. But it kept bugging me, so I started counting my steps from my bedroom to the front door.

One day it was 17.
Another day it was 18.
Then 19.

It wasn’t every day. Sometimes it stayed the same. Sometimes it didn’t. I forgot to keep track for a few weeks once, and when I finally counted again, it was 39 steps to the front door.

That wasn’t the only thing. Doors in the hallway would switch which side their hinges were on. Doorknobs changed shape. The wallpaper in the hall went from a faded floral pattern to plain beige, then back again. At one point I went back to look at the screenshots I’d taken of the original Craigslist listing, just to prove to myself that I wasn’t losing it.

Everything matched the house exactly as it was.

I remember staring at the pictures, thinking they didn’t look like that. They had to. But they didn’t.

Eventually, I asked my roommate if he’d noticed anything weird about the house. Things moving. The hallway getting longer. The front door drifting further away.

He shrugged and said he hadn’t noticed anything. He told me that sometimes old houses can play tricks on your mind.

I didn’t bring it up again.

I don’t remember my roommate moving out. He must have, though, because one day I realized there was an empty room down the hall. It doesn’t look like the room he used to have, but it has to be. There isn’t anywhere else it could have come from.

No one I talked to remembered me ever having a roommate. The lease only had my name on it. Pictures on my phone never showed anyone else living there. After a while, even my memories of him got fuzzy. I couldn’t remember his face. Or his voice.

Sometimes I swear I remember standing out front with him, passing a joint back and forth, joking about how quiet the street was during lockdown. That doesn’t really make sense, though. If he never existed, that couldn’t have happened. I probably just smoked too much back then.

Rent went up not long after that. I didn’t really want to move out. I’d grown pretty fond of the house and its little tricks. So I decided to get a new roommate to help cover the cost.

He’s nice. A little paranoid, maybe. He keeps pointing out small things about the house, like how the doors open the wrong way or how the hallway feels longer than it should be.

He broke his bedroom door a few days ago by trying to force it open the wrong way.

I thought it was funny, I did the exact same thing my first week here.

It’s probably just the old house playing tricks on him.
