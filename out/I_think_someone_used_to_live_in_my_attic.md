This happened between 2016 ish through 2024. 

So we live in a modern house with an attic that isn’t used for anything, and the only “door” is a panel you push up and aside. It’s quite heavy, and is located in our guest bedroom which we do not go into very often. Our guest bedroom also has a window leading to our backyard, about 8-9 feet off the ground, but there is an air conditioning unit under it. There is a little runway right beside this between the house and the fence, and my window (basement, so it’s above my bed from the inside) is along this. 

Back around 2016 ish I had started hearing sounds and stuff at night, but never thought anything of it. I also would sometimes hear what sounded like whispers outside my window at night, but I always dismissed them as being tired. 

But this is where it starts: in 2016 I had to go clean out the guest bedroom when I noticed the attic panel was 1/2 pushed up (angled), as if someone failed to put it back on. I put my phone on a selfie stick and took a video with my flash on, but didn’t see anything (albeit it was a shitty video because I was scared). I called my mom, dad, sister and grandparents, none of whom had a clue as to why it would be like that. A couple nights later I heard footsteps and someone getting water. I walked upstairs thinking it was my mom, only to realize she was asleep. 

Fast forward to some other weird things between then and 2024. There was about 3 times my dog was on our porch barking at night, and he DID NOT EVER BARK. This would scare me, as I’d have to pick him up and drag him in, and he would still stand there. He would be barking at something inside the yard, but there was never animals there. There was also 2 times I swear someone knocked on our BACK door, and our dog would lose it (again, these were the only times in his life he barked). TBH I was horrified but would go check with a baseball bat, but never saw anyone. There were multiple occasions I found the guest room window opened, even in the winter. Once I left for college my mom would start calling me every once in a while asking if I took some item that I had not (at this point it was just her at home). She then admitted she thought she needed to see a psychiatrist, because she thought she was hearing the fridge open, footsteps, and thought she was opening the guest room window and not remembering going in there. That’s when I told her all my experiences, and we got freaked out. 

My dad would be home 3-4 days a month, so never believed us. But eventually we convinced him to install cameras and change the locks. Literally as soon as we did this, everything stopped. No more noises, no more food missing, no more whispers, no more open windows, nothing. 

So, Reddit, was someone living in our attic, or did my mom and I just convince ourselves of it?
