I watched through my bedroom window as my mom walked a stumbling Mikey back to his parents’.  The pit in my stomach had eroded my nerves completely before I finally rushed to my bed.  Pulling the blanket up, I yelled, “What did you do to him?! He was bleeding!”

The little starman nonchalantly walked out to greet me, “Why, I just needed some of his earwax!  It's fuel where I come from.  I told you, it was nothing special! I just can’t use yours, because it's been in contact with my ship for too long.”

Unable to follow his logic, nor pick up on his wishy-washy fuel explanation, I slumped to the floor exhausted.  He reassured me with a tiny, cold pat with his hand-like appendage, “No worries, sir, I can guarantee your pal will be aaaaalright.”

I looked down at him, his dark visor hiding a face I could not imagine, “I’m not bringing anyone else up.  I don’t want you hurting my friends.”

He stared at me a second before replying, “No worries, I believe I have the fuel I need to continue my repairs, along with ensuring I uphold my side of the bargain.”

I nodded, a clear uncertainty about my decisions weighed heavily and openly in my mind.  I think he picked up on my internal conflict.  He was slick, of course he was.  With a quick turn, he retreated under the bed.  The spacedog exited and cuddled with me as I sat disheveled.  I heard the humming rev up, and the green light came back on.  I sat listening, and the space dog licked my face and wagged its tail happily.  The starman returned, dragging out a new box.  It was more decorated than the others; its silver wrapping was complemented with a silver bow.  He hauled it to where I sat and plopped it in front of me, “Here you go, sir.  I thought this present would help ease your mind about the whole situation!  As well as a thank you for your assistance!”

I leaned over, unsure of what to expect.  I held the dog in my lap as I tore the present open.  

A walkie-talkie.  Its simple design, paired with the matching silver material, gave it a sleek look I was immediately obsessed with.  I looked over at him, still catering a sense of unease, when he said, “Turn it on.”

I examined the walkie-talkie, found a switch on its side, and flipped it.  I held down the only other button on it.  A voice came through.  “Hey \*\*\*!” 

Despite the static camouflaging the voice, I knew right away it was Mikey, “Mikey! Is that you!? Are you ok?”

“Yeah, I’m fine, my head just ached for a little bit.” 

“Did my mom seem mad when she dropped you off?”  I selfishly asked.

“No, I think just a little irked is all.”

“Is your ear still bleeding?”

“Nope.”

I felt relief replace all the anxiety I had been feeling, with a sigh, I joked with him for a couple of minutes before he ended the call. 

“Already? Can you talk after dinner?”  I asked.

“No, sorry, I have to start packing.”

Confusion, “Packing for what?”

“Vacation, my parents surprised me with a plan to go to Disney World on a cross-country trip.  I’ll be leaving soonish.”

Another shock, too many for one day. “Will I get to see you before you go?”

“Sorry, I don’t think so.  I have a lot of packing, and my parents don’t want me getting sick before we go.  But, I’ll keep in touch with this walkie-talkie I found in my pocket!”

We continued for a second, and I aired my feelings of disappointment, especially after I had just gotten back on good terms with him.  No mention of the fight, no mention of the way I behaved after he caught me crying.  Just friends again.  Just what I wanted.  What I wanted.  I remember as Mikey hung up, I felt great and at ease again.  I heard my front door open; my mom had returned home.  I decided to go downstairs and get the scolding over with.  As I closed the door behind me, I gave a quick wave to the starman as he stood there next to my bed.  A smile on my face.  I had gotten everything I had wanted out of the day.  He waved back as the door shut.  

This is why it took me so long to notice, he was sneaky.  From that day, I interacted with Mikey through that walkie-talkie exclusively… all that time.  I wasn’t talking to Mikey.
