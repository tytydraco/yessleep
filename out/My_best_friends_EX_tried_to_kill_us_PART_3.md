“Sadie, we have to jump!” Willow stood and grasped my with a renewed sense of bravery. I let her pull me to my feet, but in the corner of my eye I could see the big lizard still skimming the surface of the water. A sickly thin man with a mullet operated the boat, cigarette lit in his mouth. I noticed with dread that the jet skier was the same guy from earlier. Before I could protest, Willow leapt, pulling me with her. We seemed to sail through the air in slow motion. Willow’s feet had just broken the surface when Mullet grabbed her by her t-shirt. She slammed hard into the side of his boat, crying out with the impact. Her grip on my arm failed, sending me crashing into the water. I frantically broke the surface and for the slightest moment looked at the shore. The alligator had disappeared. The shore was freedom if I could make it. Another cry from Willow quickly dowsed my temptation. I ignored what my gut was screaming at me and clambered onto the boat. I was not going to leave Willow to these inbreds.

She sat slumped and barely conscious at the bow of the boat, Mullet had made quick work of tying her hands behind her back. Her t-shirt was torn, and I could just make out a massive bruise already forming along her ribs. Mullet took a long pull from his cigarette and chuckled “Well lookie here Cleatus, we got us a twofurone!”. He punctuated his statement with a crudely placed kick to my gut. I fell flat from my hands and knees, gasping from the impact. Cleatus whistled “And ain’t they some beauties too. Be a shame to see em’ bloated and eated on.” He propped his chin on the handlebars of the jet ski. Mullet nodded with agreement and, with a more serious tone, said “I dropped the damn radio grabbin’ little miss. I got the sitchiation here if you can mozey along an tell the others.”

“Alrighty then, you’d better keep both eyes on em, Dean.” Cleatus fired up the Jet ski, then gave a repulsive smolder towards Willow, “Especially that one.”.

Within moments Cleatus had peeled off and disappeared around the bend.

Mullet, who I refused to think of as Dean, roughly pulled me to my feet intending to tie my hands. Willow, appearing more alert, fumbled with her bindings. We had one chance here. I quickly scanned for anything I could hit him with, but the only contender, a paddle, was behind Willow. With no weapon available, I threw my shoulder into Mullet as hard as I could, but *damn* he was solid for being pencil-thin. He stumbled a few steps back and didn’t lose balance. “Oh you wanna play ROUGH!” He yelled, enraged, arms outstretched in case I tried to dodge past him. Using purchase from the side of the boat, and understanding the unlikely success of my attempt, I threw my whole weight into his gut in one futile last effort to send him overboard.

He was ready for me this time. With one hand, he ensnared my hair and twisted, lifting me into the air. Stabbing pain seared my scalp, and I cried out in pain, my legs dangling beneath me like a kitten being held by it’s mother. No, more like a rabbit trapped in a fox’s jaws. “OOOhhhh-wee you’re a spicy one. Mind yourself,”  He nodded towards Willow, “we only need that one unharmed.” I writhed in his grip and he roughly shook me, sending shockwaves of pain down my spine, then held me face level with a grin.

I spat in his face then, invigorated by adrenaline and rage, clawed at his hands while lashing out with vicious, precise kicks, hoping to buy myself even a second to escape. My heart pounded in my ears. In the midst of my struggle I noticed Willow fiercely sawing her bindings against the sharp paddle edge. In the next moment, Mullet plunged me beneath the surface of the murky water. I didn’t have time to catch a full breath of air, my mouth filled with filthy water instantly.  I fought my instinct to struggle, mindful of my close encounter earlier, aware that the creature might be nearby, if not beneath me already. The boat’s softly churning propeller emitted a mechanical hum that resonated through the water.  I could just make out Mullet’s blurry, acne-ridden face illuminated by the boat’s spotlight. His hands remained firmly entangled in my hair, holding my head just inches from the surface.

Determined to escape his grip, I gritted my teeth and dug my nails deeply into his wrist, tearing through his skin. His cry of pain was muffled by the river’s surface, his face contorted, and I flashed him a mocking grin. My grin faltered as I realized in a panic that his grip did not loosen. He rewarded by performance by slamming my head into the side of the boat. My remaining oxygen erupted in a confetti of bubbles on impact.

Black tunnels creeped into my peripheral vision, and dark blood wisped in the water. I couldn’t tell if it was mine or his, maybe a mix of both. The lack of oxygen tightened my chest and throat. My thoughts felt suddenly dream-like and incomplete as my mind skipped, trying to find a way out of this flytrap.

An overwhelming sense of fatigue welled through my body as the cold grip of suffocation closed in on me. I’m going to drown here, in the hands of this low-IQ troglodyte. The remainder of my vision was reduced to mere pinpricks. I grasped meekly at Mullet’s arms, trying to stay conscious. Willow’s icy face peered over Mullet’s shoulder, like a banshee harboring my death song. Then, everything went black.

\-----

My diaphragm heaved as water evacuated my lungs. Willow loomed over me, hands still clasped from CPR. Her face was alight with relief as she pulled me into a tight hug.

“Dude I thought you were like, dead-dead! Oh my god.” 

I hugged her back, weak and somewhat delirious. “Me too.” I croaked, voice hoarse. I wish I had more words of thanks for her, but instead I was muted by the overwhelming valor of her actions. Remnants of rope remained tightly fixed on Willow’s wrists, actualizing our current reality.  We were still on the boat.

I asked “Willow, what happened to Mullet guy?” she released me from her hug and looked at me sheepishly. “I, uh,” she stumbled, “you see I shoved him and…” a frantic voice cut her off from the aft of the boat “I’m HERE! I’M HERE, Get me OUT!”. I stood slowly, still wobbly from my head injury, and assessed the situation. Mullet floated still in the water; his mullet hopelessly tangled in the propeller of the boat. “Karma sucks doesn’t it, asshole.” I jeered down at him. He reached sharply for me, causing a loud splash. “Careful, big boy is probably watching you from below.” I smirked as he spat in my general direction.

Willow sat heavily across from me. “I was able to cut the engine before it scrambled him, but I don’t know how to reverse it.” I looked at her dumbfounded and replied slowly “I..have no idea how to reverse it either. Isn’t there usually a switch or a lever?”. It didn’t help that my thoughts still felt sluggish. We fumbled around the panel until we discovered a small switch that looked promising. Willow reached towards the switch, but I abruptly stopped her. “Willow, what are we going to do when we let him out? He literally tried to kill me.” Willow, hand on the switch, paused and whispered “Oh, shit, I hadn’t thought about that. There’s still rope left?” Mullet called from the back “I’ll be good, just get me un- tangled!” Doubtful. I raised an eyebrow at Willow, who returned the gesture. “Here,” I said, “I’ll tie him before we untangle him.”

Rope in hand, I made a slipknot and dangled it over Mullet. “Put your hands in or you sleep here.” I wasn’t about to lean over and give him the opportunity to pull me in. Luckily, he complied, not wanting to extend his stay in the water. A beep rang out as Willow turned the boat electronics on.

“SHIT!” Mullet yelled, spooked at the noise.

“Shut up you’re fine” I spat. To Willow I asked, “you turned the switch right?” She looked at me frozen.

 “Right?” I asked again, more firmly.

“Uh, I think so.” She stammered

“you *think*”

“I can’t remember if I did” she admitted

“*WHAT*” Mullet cried from the back, followed by a string of curses

“*DUDE* I was distracted, I just saved your life, I know I touched the switch” She reasoned

“You touched it but did you TURN it?”

“I DON’T KNOW” she yelled as threw her hands up at me “I THINK that I turned it”.

I stopped tightening the knot and stared at her blankly. She squirmed under my non-expressiveness, then said decisively “I’m turning on the engine.” Mullet screamed “WAIT” before erupting into a volley of even more colorful curses. Before I could react, Willow turned on the engine.

CHUNG. CHUNG. CHUNG.

Bits of scalp, blood, brain, and skull exploded into the air. Fresh gore sprayed across my face and t-shirt. We watched in horror as the mutilated ground meat, that was Mullet’s head, was actively chummed into unrecognizable scraps. I immediately vomited at the sight. I clutched the edge of the boat, emptying my guts into the chummed water. The propeller continued to whir blending my puke with human pâté, the sight of it causing me to vomit more. I sat upright, bile dripping from my lips. Willow had turned ghostly pale, her mouth agape as she attempted to process what had just happened. I managed to spit “cut the engine” before puking one last time.

  
What happens next coming (hopefully) next week!
