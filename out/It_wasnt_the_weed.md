I don’t like my friend’s apartment. 

For someone so colorful and lively, there’s a heavy stillness that weighs the place down. It gets very little natural light despite having windows that face the central courtyard. Two walls in the living room are painted black, meeting at the corner where her gray sectional is tucked in. There’s a lamp or two but they only emit a dim glow, even with fresh lightbulbs. When a few of us have been over to hang, the vibe seems to dampen everyone’s mood by the time we leave. 

She once told me that a little girl had been murdered in the complex in the 70s by the father and that the building manager alluded that it happened in her very apartment. So I always chalked up the feeling to that. Whether or not you believe in ghosts or anything of the sort, you can’t deny the creepiness of a murder scene. 

I’d known she hadn’t been feeling well so I wasn’t surprised when our mutual friend suggested that we drop by with drinks and snacks to cheer her up. The entire time I’d known her, she’d had a variety of ailments—from toothaches to ear infections to pulled back muscles and bruises she couldn’t explain. Her not feeling well was nothing new. 

Of course, I agreed.

Unusually, I was the first to arrive, managing to snag a parking spot across the street. The entry to the building has those mid-century style cement blocks and enormous glass doors, with the courtyard just beyond. 

A woman stood in front of the glass. It was rare to see one of the neighbors. The building was pretty quiet and it seemed like everyone kept to themselves. She was muttering to herself and stared when she noticed me approaching. Her dark hair was pulled back in a stringy bun and her eyes were sallow and sunken. It was hard to tell if she was older or younger than me, only that life had been harsh. There are plenty of mentally ill people in the city—hell, I’m one of them. So I smiled and it spurred her to punch in the code and open the door for me. But she only pushed it open slightly, situating herself against it so my chest grazed hers as I squeezed past, staring at me the entire time. My “excuse me” didn’t seem to have any effect. She followed me in and I could feel her eyes on my back as I rounded the corner to my friend’s ground floor unit. 

I knocked once and my friend ripped the door open, as if she’d been waiting for me on the other side. She quickly ushered me in and when she closed the door, I mentioned the woman. 

My friend is striking, with beautiful large eyes that everyone seems to get lost in. But I’d never seen them get so big, the whites fully exposed like a panicked horse. They were made all the more unsettling by the uncomfortable smile tightly stretched across her chapped lips. Her voice dropped to the barest whisper and I had to lean in to hear her say, 

“That woman is trying to kill me.”

She went on to explain a series of bizarre occurrences with this neighbor from the last nine years, long before I knew her, and I listened with a growing sense of alarm. She’d never mentioned this neighbor before and I’d never seen her until that day. 

The woman lived in the apartment directly above her and constantly accused my friend of playing loud music and rearranging her furniture at all hours of the night, banging on her floor in retaliation. She claimed she could hear all her conversations, whether on the phone or with friends or lovers who came over. She always emerged when my friend left her apartment, gripping the rail and leaning over dangerously to watch her go. She’d gone to the building manager and the police, insisting that my friend’s previous roommate was stalking her—despite him being at his boyfriend’s more often than home and never having spoken to her. She would scream for an unseen black car across the street to leave her alone, often involving the cops in that too.

My friend confessed she suspected this neighbor was going through her trash, having noticed her following with her own bags whenever she took garbage to the dumpster out back.

She didn’t even know the woman’s name. Any early attempt to be friendly had been met with intense, disconcerting stares and silence. She only referred to her as 2A. 

“I think she’s schizophrenic or something.” She finished wanly. 

Only half joking, I told her she needed a gun. 

Our other friend arrived shortly after. She didn’t bring up the neighbor, only that we had to keep it down. 

We played music videos on the tv at a low volume and settled in with our drinks and snacks. I’d brought over a nice joint to share and her mood slowly relaxed, the cheer in her voice picking up again. She sat in the corner of her couch. It was her usual spot. As we passed the joint around, she updated us on her life. 

She’d been having headaches recently and was passed over for a promised promotion at work. Her situationship ended poorly with a minor STI. There was a falling out with a friend who’d suddenly turned cold. Her car was having issues and she couldn’t afford the quote from the mechanic. We offered our sympathies, validating her feelings, and speculating if there was something going on with the planets. 

Through it all, that heavy stillness settled on my shoulders and wrapped around my head. I focused on being present through the haze of smoke. The joint was a hybrid and distantly I chided myself for not bringing an upbeat sativa. I felt the familiar pressure on my eyes and the center of my face. It was only that, I assured myself. *Don’t be weird.*

When our drinks needed to be refreshed, the three of us headed to the stark white kitchen, lit by a hideous overheard fluorescent light. Trepidation crept over my scalp, spreading through my nervous system as I picked another flavor of hard seltzer. Don’t be weird, I reminded myself. *Don’t be fucking weird.* But then my eyes were drawn to that one dark corner. 

The layout of the apartment allows a long, clear view to the living room from the kitchen. My vision tunneled as it lengthened and stretched, both near and far. I couldn’t hear whatever my friends were talking about and they were equally oblivious to what I was experiencing. 

The corner grew darker, and darker. It mushroomed to the ceiling and I watched as my friends went back to the couch. As she took her usual seat in that open maw of black. My entire body froze with a primal sense of danger, skin clammy with my heart in my throat. 

My father died when I was a teenager. He’s been dead for a long time. But his voice rang out in my head, clear as day.

*Run.*

Now, I’ve been stoned to high heaven plenty of times in my life. You could call me a professional. It’s never given me auditory hallucinations or any sense of paranoia. I’m the only one in my friend group who does not have some form of social or clinical anxiety. I’m the one who’s calm in the face of fear. I’m the one who’s steady in emergencies. 

I’ve never felt this type of dread before and I hope to never experience it again. 

Guilt stayed me from leaving immediately. I returned to my chair, chiming in only occasionally as I tried to quickly finish my drink with all the subtly I could muster.

I looked at my friends, again trying to be present. Once more, my gaze pulled to the darkness in the corner, blacker than pitch. Blacker than the emptiness of space. 

This time, it was my grandmother’s voice I heard and she screamed.

*RUN.*

I remember bolting up and making some excuse about an early morning. Our mutual friend took that moment to also announce it was time for her to depart. 

I saw a flicker of desperation in my friend’s doe eyes, a brief wildness that edged on hysteria. But then it was gone and she was wishing us safe drives home. She walked us to the door and I was grateful that neighbor was nowhere to be seen. We promised to text to confirm our arrivals unscathed and made our way out of the building. 

Our friend had parked just behind me and as we walked to our cars, I managed to keep my voice light as I asked,

“Did you feel anything weird in there?”

She rolled her eyes with a long suffering sigh.

“It’s so depressing, I wish she’d open a window. And maybe paint the walls a jewel tone if she wants the drama. The black is *oppressive.*”

“Did you feel anything else?” I hedged, still uneasy despite being outside. She gave me an odd look.

“Did you?”

I described my sense of dread and the weird interaction I had with the neighbor when coming in. I left out hearing my father and grandmother’s warning.

Her lips pursed slightly but her tone was gentle. 

“I think you smoked a little too much. Are you sure you’re ok to drive?”

I hid my dismay behind a close lipped smile and assured her I was fine. 

As I sped to my neighborhood, I called my roommate and asked her to bring out the rock salt for my arrival. I didn’t want to cross the threshold of the house without a cleansing. I didn’t want to bring that darkness home. I’m ashamed to admit I cried during the drive. 

My roommate met me out front without question. I took fistfuls of salt and rubbed the rough granules over my arms and chest, down my torso to my legs. I poured it over my head, not caring that it caught in my hair, and made sure to scrub my face and neck. Even my armpits. 

I threw salt in my car. I walked around it casting salt at the exterior. 

As I came around the back, I spied a faint black handprint with fingers too long and too few and a palm too wide, clinging to the bumper. It was smeared, as if the car took off too fast to get a firm grip.

I refuse to go back. 

When she asks to make plans, I suggest public locations or our other friends will offer to host. Each time I see her, she looks weaker. She doesn’t mention the neighbor. I don’t mention her either. 

But when our eyes meet, I see an understanding there. Both a haunting accusation and acceptance. 

She knows I know and I feel worse for it.
