Hi, it's Margeret again. As I said before that I would I took a sledge hammer to the wall. That was a big mistake and why I am writing another post. I had not intended to make more then one. However things have gotten worse.

It tricked me. I thought the thing in the walls was ghost or something similar wanting its body found. I now know it was never human and I have released it unto the world once more.

I smashed down the wall. It took a lot longer then I expected. The wall was thick. I expected to find a skeleton or something holding a skeleton. I found a large lead lined box that I assumed contained the body. It was covered in weird symbols and french writing I could not understand.

I thought at the point that poor ghost had been used in a ritual sacrifice to a demon or God. Then I stupidly opened the box. When I did I felt a rash of air some come out it I thought the room was on fire briefly. I shook it off though and looked down into the box. I found more weird symbols, a mirror, some ash, and a note in french but no skeleton. I paled and realized I fucked up. The thing was never human.

I turned around saw what looked like a shadow seeping into my closet. It was watching me. "Shit. Fucking shit. It tricked me.", I exclaimed. With quick thinking I grabbed the box and ran from the room. I almost ran over James as I barreled down the stairs.

He screams at me, "You stupid bitch. You could have killed me. What the hell is that?" As I run past him.

I do not answer him. I don't have time. I go to Daisy's room and lock myself in with the box. I can hear James pounding on the door and yelling for a little while. Then I hear him go up stairs.

A moment later I hear the sound of glass breaking and then I see James's body land outside Daisy's window onto the ground. It killed him. The thing I released killed him. It was all my fault. I should have ignored it. I am now sitting here while facing away from the window writing as I wait for police, Daisy, our counselors, and a Catholic priest I called named Marcos. 

Marcos is coming from the nearest catholic church which is surprisingly 3 hours away. I am scared and my hands are shaking as I type this all out. I hope they all make it before the thing decides to kill me too. I can hear it up stairs whispering in french. I do not know what to do. 

If it was now strong enough to throw James out a window what will it do to me? I think to myself. I am terrified that it will come down stairs if I try to make a break out the door. My phone is quickly losing power. I have to go.
