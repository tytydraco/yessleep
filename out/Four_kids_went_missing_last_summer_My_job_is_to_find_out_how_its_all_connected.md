Can you remember the day your life [changed forever?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/19c4psh/four_kids_went_missing_last_summer_my_job_is_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) For some people, it was the birth of their first child, the death of a loved one, or an event that scarred them for life.

I can remember the day my life changed forever.

My wife Susan and I were returning from a New York trip. We had an amazing time, she couldn’t stop talking about it on the way home. I promised her we could go back whenever she wanted, we only lived seven hours away.

I have always been able to talk and pay attention to the road. It’s why I’m always the one driving the car.

I still remember the smile on her face, seconds before we were hit. A car came from the treeline and rammed into our car.

I can remember Susan screaming for me to wake up. I couldn’t open my eyes.

When I finally woke up in the hospital, I was told she died on impact.

\-

For a couple of months, I went back to work. I was a police detective for a small town in Massachusetts. Everything came crashing down when I got Susan's life insurance. It was like being in a car accident all over again.   
  
I quit my job after that and spent two months in a mental hole that felt impossible to climb out of. Every moment spent trying to heal was agony. I had to find a different way to heal, I needed to keep myself occupied.   
  
In October, I became a private investigator.   
  
In November, I got the case that would change my perception of the world.   
  
\-  
  
I was sitting in my home office checking my email when I got the package delivered to my door. There was a loud series of knocks, followed by a loud thud on my porch. I slid my chair from my desk and ran to the door to see what happened.   
  
Susan would tell me to check the window first, so I did. I moved to the window closest to the door and peeled back the curtains. No one was standing on my porch but there was a large package sitting at my door.   
  
After giving it some consideration, I opened my front door and took the box inside. It wasn’t completely rare to have a client drop something off at my door. I slid the box onto my dining table and sat next down.   
  
I sat there for ten minutes watching the box before finally using my keys to rip the tape open and check inside.   
\-  
  
The card on the top of the box was addressed to me, Noah.   
  
I sat down again and read the cart out loud, twice.   
  
“I am giving this package to you in the hopes that you can help me. In July, a series of kidnappings happened that we haven’t been able to solve. $1,000 is enclosed in the envelope under this letter, it will cover your investigation. If you find anything please call 351-XXX-XXXX.”   
  
The moment I placed the letter on the table I went looking for the money and sure enough it was all there. No one has ever given me that much upfront, so this must’ve been serious. After counting the money I looked around to see if there was a return address or something on the box, when I couldn’t find it I started digging through the folders.   
  
\-  
  
The first folder was for a girl named Victoria Summers. She had blonde hair and gray eyes, she was an average weight, and stood at 5’5. Victoria was 16, and the last picture taken of her was on her way to the school bus. The note attached to the photo said it was her mom who took it.   
  
As I went through the folder I found a card, I slid it out of the folder and flipped it over. It was for someplace called the Steadfast Hotel. I had never heard of it. I put the card to the side with her photo and shook the bag. There was one more thing left inside.   
  
I reached in and pulled out a ring. The ring was blue and gold, and a tag attached to it read, Cheerleading Championship Ring.   
  
I put the ring on her picture and slid the last item belonging to Victoria out of the box. It was her backpack, it had a lot of wear and tear on it. The note attached said that the bag was found by a janitor in the girls' bathroom.   
  
As I opened the backpack I was surprised to see all of her school folders were left inside. I took the first binder I saw out and read the spine.    
  
Property of Victoria Summers: Clearview High School  
  
We didn’t have a place called Clearview in my town, so I made a note to check the surrounding areas. I placed Victoria's items to the side.  
  
Once I put her backpack down, a searing pain shot through my temples. It felt like I was being burned for a second, and when the pain subsided I was left with an itching.   
  
\-  
  
The next folder was for a boy named Riley Thompson.   
  
Riley was 16, had black hair, was an average weight, and had green eyes. I was looking for a height but it wasn’t listed. His photo was of him standing on a football field. I scanned his photo a couple of times, looking to see if I could find the school he went to.   
  
The next picture was of him standing next to a girl. He had his arm around her, I flipped it over and read what was on the back.   
  
Riley and Taylor before the big move.  
  
The final thing in his bag was a school ring. It was inside of a small plastic bag. The ring was coated in blood. As I held the ring the pain came rushing back to my head. I quickly put it on the table and held my head with both of my hands.   
  
When the pain finally subsided I checked the box. The only other thing Riley had was a towel in a plastic bag. I flipped the bag a few times and when I saw the blood splotched I wondered where they found the towel. The corner of the towel had the words, Steadfast Hotel, engraved on it.   
  
\-  
  
The next batch was for a girl named Alice Andrews.   
  
She had the least amount of information in her file. As I sorted through her folder I found a picture of her standing outside the Steadfast Hotel. The hotel looked old, the neon side behind Alice lit up with the SF connected.   
  
The last item in her bag was a pink pen.   
  
\-  
  
As I reached the end of the box I found one more folder for a boy named Charlie Carter. I was surprised at how thick the folder was.  
  
I opened it looking for any information about him first, and when I couldn’t find it I went through each one of the pictures.   
  
The first was of Charlie sitting with the Clearview High School mascot. It looked like the mascot was a chimpanzee. Charlie had deep red hair and green eyes.   
  
The second photo was him sitting outside of a place called the Faraday Carnival, another place I had never heard of before.    
  
The third photo was extremely blurry. I could see Charlie sitting in front of a ride, but everything around him was blurry. His shirt had the words White Noise on it.   
  
The last few pictures disturbed me. Everyone was of him sleeping, his dog sleeping, and what I assumed to be his parents sleeping. I quickly put everything back into the box and put the money in my coat pocket.   
  
I was going to bring the box to the police station but I heard something rustling outside of my house. I moved quickly to get my boots on and took a baseball bat from next to my door with me, as I flung the door open I could hear whimpering outside.   
  
It was too dark to make anything out clearly, “Hello!” I screamed into the darkness.   
  
“Help me!” A girl said as she came sprinting to my porch.    
  
She had blood all over her nose, the side of her head, and her white tee shirt.   
  
I held my bat out to keep her back.   
  
“Stay away from my porch!” I screamed at the girl.   
  
\-  
  
“Please.” The girl gasped at me as she grabbed the railing.   
  
“Who are you?” I called out.  
  
“My name is Taylor.” She called back. I could tell it was getting harder for her to stand up.    
  
I decided to take a chance and lower my bat.   
  
Taylor trudged up the staircase, once she reached me and the light hit her face I recognized her right away. It was Taylor, from the picture.   
  
“How the hell did you find me?” I asked her as I helped her into my house.   
  
“The headache you got, I got one too,” Taylor said as she clung to my arm.   
  
“We have to get out of here.” Taylor wheezed as I brought her to the living room to sit down.   
  
“No, I have to call your parents,” I told Taylor   
  
“They’re dead. They’ve been dead for months.” Taylor hissed.   
  
I watched the tears stream down her face for a second before we heard the sound of coins shaking. I narrowed my eyes and moved to the closest window.   
  
“He’s here!” Taylor screamed as she got off the couch.   
  
“Who?” I asked before being blown back from the window.   
  
I hit the coffee table and gasped for air. I could feel wood digging into my sides. I could feel Taylor's hand grabbing at my shoulder but everything was spinning. When I could finally see straight I turned my head, a giant hook attached to a thick chain was sitting on the floor next to me.   
  
\-  
  
“What the hell?” I groaned as I finally got to my feet just in time to watch the hulking figure enter through the window.   
  
It was wearing a long black trench coat, big black boots, and broad shoulders. The hat on its head was tipped in a way that concealed its face from us. I could hear Taylor screaming at me to get up.   
  
I slowly moved my arm to reach under the couch as the creature lifted its head. He had a horse head, at least the skill of a horse on his head. The bones formed in such a way that didn’t allow the mouth to open.   
  
I thought I was hallucinating.   
  
The creature screeched at me, I watched it slowly raise the chain in its hand. I wasn’t going to allow it to hit me. I ripped out my arm from under the couch and shot the creature in the head. Its head snapped back and it fell backward.   
  
\-  
  
“It’s not dead,” Taylor screamed at me as she helped me to my feet.   
  
“I shot it in the head,” I argued.   
  
“It doesn’t matter.” Taylor whimpered.   
  
She was right, I could hear it stirring. I contemplated going back to it and shooting it again but if it was just going to get up I figured that it would be a waste of ammunition.   
  
We ran into the kitchen and I grabbed the box. After that, I ran to the pantry and grabbed one of my go bags.   
  
“Come on,” I told Taylor as I opened the backdoor for her, making sure to put the gun in my pocket for now.   
  
I took Taylor to the car I had out back and helped her into the passenger seat. I put the box in the back seat and took the keys off of my hip to drive.   
  
“You keep your keys on you?” Taylor asked me.  
  
“Always,” I said as I started the car and pulled around my house.   
  
I thought we were in the clear, but I was wrong. As my car hit the road we heard a loud crash. I looked out of the window and saw its weapon right next to the car. I pressed the gas and drove as fast as possible.   
  
“What does it want?” I asked Taylor as I took a sharp turn.   
  
“Something you have.” Taylor groaned.   
  
She was probably talking about something in the box.   
  
“Make sure to buckle up,” I said seriously.   
  
\-  
  
This thing was still chasing after us twenty minutes later. We were fortunate that it was pretty late and there weren’t a lot of cars on the road. Still, I made sure to stick to the back roads.   
“It will go away when the sun comes out,” Taylor mumbled.   
  
I could tell she wasn’t feeling good and neither was I. There was a searing pain in my chest, I was honestly surprised a hit from the monster didn’t kill me.   
  
Luckily for us, Taylor was right. I kept driving around until around 6 in the morning. The creature finally disappeared when the sun came up.   
  
My next goal was to get us to a hospital, though I knew I had a lot of explaining to do. I let Taylor sleep for the rest of the ride.   
  
I still couldn’t believe what I saw. That thing was clearly not human, and for it to just disappear was wild. We were fortunate that I grabbed my go bag, and had my cellphone with me. After we take a trip to the hospital, I am going to find out what that creature wanted from the box.
