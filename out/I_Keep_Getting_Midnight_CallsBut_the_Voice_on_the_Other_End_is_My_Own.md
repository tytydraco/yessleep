The first time my phone rang at **exactly 12:00 AM**, I ignored it.

I was half-asleep, barely registering the muffled vibrations on my nightstand. The glow of my screen cast an eerie rectangle of light onto the ceiling. **Private Number.** No voicemail. No second call.

Just silence.

The second night, it happened again. **12:00 AM, on the dot.**

This time, I answered.

At first, there was nothing. Just a soft crackling, like an old radio caught between stations. I pressed the phone tighter against my ear.

Then, a whisper.

*"Don’t open the door."*

My breath hitched. The voice was distant, hollow, as if it came from the bottom of a deep well. I sat up, scanning my darkened bedroom. My apartment was on the **third floor**. No one was outside my door. Still, I checked—creeping toward it on unsteady legs, pressing my eye to the peephole.

**Nothing.**

I shook my head, locking the deadbolt for good measure. Probably some prank. A robocall glitch.

I should’ve blocked the number right then.

Because the **third night**, the voice came back.

**12:00 AM.**

The screen glowed against the darkness of my room, illuminating my trembling fingers as I swiped to answer.

*"The cat will be gone tomorrow."*

It was the same voice. That same distant, empty tone.

I almost laughed. I didn’t even own a cat. But my neighbor’s tabby, **Whiskers**, often lounged on my balcony, sneaking in whenever I left the door open.

The next morning, Whiskers was **gone**.

Vanished.

His owner, an elderly woman down the hall, knocked on my door with worry lines etched into her face.

“He’s never run off before,” she said.

I swallowed hard.

Coincidence, I told myself. **Just a coincidence.**

Then came **Night Four.**

**12:00 AM.**

I answered before the first ring finished.

*"The blue car will crash into a tree."*

I didn’t even react this time. I forced myself to laugh, to call it bullshit.

But the next morning, as I drove to work, I saw it.

A **blue sedan**, wrapped around a thick oak tree near the main road.

A crowd had gathered. The driver was slumped against the airbag, unconscious. The windshield was shattered, the hood crumpled like paper.

I pulled over, my hands gripping the wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white.

The voice had been right. **Again.**

By **Night Five**, I was already dreading midnight.

I stayed awake, staring at the clock. **11:58. 11:59.**

Then—**12:00 AM.**

The phone rang. My heartbeat pounded in my ears as I picked up.

*"Don’t trust him. He will betray you."*

Who?

The next day, I found out.

My best friend **Tina**—the only person I had confided in about the calls—**betrayed me**.

She had told my coworkers a secret I had sworn her to keep. Something deeply personal.

I felt sick.

This wasn’t **random**. This wasn’t a prank.

The calls **weren’t just predicting the future—they were controlling it.**

**Night Six:**

*"The man in your hallway is not who you think he is."*

My stomach twisted.

I glanced at the door, dread curling in my chest like smoke.

Then—footsteps.

Slow. Measured. Pacing outside my door.

I grabbed a knife from my kitchen and peered through the peephole.

**Paul. My neighbor.**

Harmless, friendly Paul. The guy who once helped me carry my groceries.

But something about him felt…off.

The next morning, he was **arrested**.

The police found hidden cameras in another woman’s apartment. **They had been watching him for weeks.**

The voice had warned me.

And then, on **Night Nine**, everything changed.

**12:00 AM.**

The phone rang.

I answered.

But this time, the voice wasn’t distant.

It wasn’t muffled.

It wasn’t a stranger.

**It was me.**

My own voice, speaking in real time.

Repeating every word I said, perfectly.

Like an **echo.**

I gripped the phone so tightly I thought it would shatter. My own voice—**but I wasn’t speaking.**

I sucked in a shaky breath. And then—

The voice on the other end **laughed.**

Low. Twisted. Wrong.

Not my laugh.

Not anymore.

Then, silence.

Then, **click.**

I stared at my phone, nausea curling in my gut.

The calls had always predicted **someone else’s** fate.

But now, they were calling **about me.**

**Tonight is Night Ten.**

And I don’t know if I should answer.

Or if I already have.
