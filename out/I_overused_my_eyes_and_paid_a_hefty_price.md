Never ignore what your eyes tell you. Never. Eyes are given to you for a reason. I don't know who the hell designed our evolutionary paths but whoever did sure knew what was required. Everything your eyes sees is true. Don't. Take. It. As. An. Illusion.

You might take my ramblings for that of a madman. Why should you listen to a random internet keyboard basher? Well, do not then. I know a ton of you will never read on. But to the 5% that did, read with your eyes peeled. 

Remember one of those times the bunch of clothes on your bed looked like a demon staring into your soul. Or the randomly put down pipes looked in the darkness like some otherworldly entity? Well, those are all correct. 

Why, you ask? Let me tell you how this began, 3 days ago. My life was good, because it was "normal", like many of your lives are currently. I lived in my family home with my grandparents. My parents lived elsewhere in another state of Punjab while I lived in my hometown of Rajkot. I grew up normally but would always notice small things being off in the house, like their glasses being placed on books in such a way that made it look as if books wore them to look clearly at us. Or that the two pens lying in the middle of my closed notebooks sometimes randomly made a shape as if the pens are the eyes of the notebook. When I was young, I noticed this sometimes and notified my grandparents, but by the time because of some reason the distinct shapes would dissolve into something truly random, and my grandparents said it was just a coincidence and my fear of the unknown is what is making me imagine these shapes. I however knew certainly my eyes were not being fooled.

As I grew up, my fear of them turned into curiosity. These things were always..."watching" me? I don't know if watching even is the correct word. Imagine how creepy these things get when some random ink spilled by a kid on a page take the vague shape of a handprint grasping for something. My neighbour's kid did that once when I was in seventh grade, when he was over at my house for my help in his painting assignment and he decided to spill the ink on the chart paper to begin with the drawing's background, and I can make it out clearly, even though I decided to remain silent. A few days later, the kid was kidnapped and murdered for ransom.

This single incident let me know for sure that these..."coincidences", these random shapes and random formations with a meaningful shape are not completely random. I theorised they were indicators of some sort. A gift of precognition, or maybe something even more sinister. I couldn't be so sure. Most of these just looked like a watching person or entity, and only some had discernable shapes that gave me markers. Another one I recall very vividly is when I saw a six being made from the cables of my mobile's charger. The very same day, I had to travel through train to visit my parents for a day. During booking, I saw a vacancy in many seats, one of which was seat number six, which was an upper sleeping berth. I booked the ticket and sat down there. That evening, I woke up to a loud screeching sound. I got up and was about to check the window when I felt an incredible force throwing me around. There were screams all around me. I was tossed like a ragdoll around my berth but fortunately I did not fall off of the berth. The tossing around did, however, inflict serious internal injuries on me and I passed out. The next thing I remember is waking up in a hospital. When the doctor came in, he informed me about my internal organ damage, although, he assured me, it wasn't all that serious and I would be fit and fine in around 3 months. "You are a very lucky young man, " He added, "as far as we know, only you survived among the people travelling in the first 3 coaches."

A chill ran down my spine and my mind went blank for a good few seconds. This is definitely not a coincidence anymore, I thought to myself. None of these..."random" formations are coincidental. The doctors stood still for a while and said, "Your grandparents were contacted, they will arrive soon." and excused himself. I looked to the side at the nurse who was filling up the syringe for an intravenous injection. The pile of injections had two of them in the centre, separated from the rest, and from my point of view they looked like two eyes staring straight into my soul. This made me uncomfortable enough to avert my gaze away from them.

Upon my recovery, I became very observant. Paranoid, even. I would look out for even the smallest details in shapes and formations, to gain clues to predict the future. Sometimes it did work. Sometimes I failed to gain their meaning till much later, when the event pertaining to them had already occured, and yet there were other times when the symbols represented no meanings, just a pair of eyes or a finger pointing straight at me. This made no sense till one day, when I was sitting outside at my house all alone, I saw the grass being parted in such a way that I can see a clear trail in the lawn. I reasoned with myslf about the best course of action but ultimately decided it was a good idea to follow the trail. As I covered some ground, I looked back to see the trail disappearing behind me, which made my adrenaline go high, but I still kept my resolve of exploring the trail. I kept going on till I saw a clearing, with no further sign of a trail in the grass or any more indicators. Suddenly I heard a very mechanical buzz in the far-away bushes and saw a piece of light as bright as the sun itself. When my eyes grew adjusted to the light, I saw a humanoid figure in a suit that looked a mix of metal and cloth, something you would expect an astronaut to wear except the fact that it was very close fitting. This "person" looked very short, no more than 4 feet tall and had a very slender build.

As I tried to focus back on the person, the my head started spinning around and used my feet to try and steady myself. However, I realised the solid ground beneath me seemed to be "melting"; I stepped into what I think was a cross of quicksand and mud, and it quickly enveloped my feet. Despite my raging adrenaline, the dizziness got the better of me and I stumbled upon my already unsteady feet and fell down on my back. The last thing I saw before I blacked out was the "person" looking over me, with the shiny but opaque helmet of what looked like obsidian reflecting my face. I woke up 3 hours later in my lawn, in the same position as I was when I left it to search for the trail, with no memories of what happened.

I resumed my life just the same, but the formations became much more frequent. When in once a weak I would be able to find at most 5-7 formations, I began to see no less than 10 formations in a single day. What became stranger was that most of these pointed somewhere, as if I was supposed to go or look in that specific direction. Everytime I would do the same I would see something either in the corner of my eye or in a dimly lit place, something humanoid with a tight metallic-clothed suit and a helmet of obsidian. Every time I successfully identified the location of this creature a memory of the time when I followed the trail in the lawn was unlocked, which I wrote down in my diary. I cannot yet endanger you all with what I finally found out with the diary, because it was definitely something that could endanger you all just like how it endangered me. Just like how I paid the price for trusting my eyes. However, for those of you who are bravve enough to try and find out the meaning of all this (and I know there will be many): I would advise this.

Never ignore what your eyes tell you. Never. You will not have to look for him if you do.

He will find you if you use them correctly.
