There's not enough time. If any at all. We’ve discovered something that will inevitably destroy the world. Then again that's probably the only way to stop it. No one knows this except the scientists at our facility. We were told not to share this information but I cant keep this a secret. Especially since there’s no known way of stopping it. 

Just last month I went to a site. When I arrived the whole area was restricted. We were told to collect samples in the “red zone” and to do that we had to put on LEVEL A hazmat suits. For the first time I felt my heart pound after hearing that we had to use that level of a protective suit. Meaning there might be some radiation involved.

After putting on the suit, head to the site to collect samples. As I walked the marked trail I noticed what looked like rotting plants. Closer i got, I started to see dead bugs and smaller mammals. No blood but oddly they still looked alive. We collected some samples of those and then we reached the red zone. And to my surprise there was nothing. Just a bunch of rocks and dirt. And just as I suspected, we discovered some radiation, but surprisingly low levels of it. Which was odd considering the amount of decaying wildlife in the area. We got to work and collected everything. Soil, the water, decaying plant life, and small animals. We went back to our facility to further examine the specimens we collected. We didnt get far since it was time for most of us to go home. A few volunteered to stay but I wanted to go home. 

It was around 6 in the morning and i got a call from my boss. I was annoyed because I didn't go to work till 8. I answered and my boss, in an urgent voice, told me to get to the facility ASAP. I took it seriously and got dressed quickly and headed out the door. What could it be? I wondered. I get to the building with a few of my cowokers waiting for me.

“Follow us hurry.” 

“What’s going on?” i said confused and wanting answers.

We hurriedly walked to one of our labs to find it sealed off with one of coworkers who stayed the night. Hes just sitting on the chair staring at the ceiling. 


“What’s Adam doing? Let him out.” I said about to unseal the door. 

“NO STOP!” I turned to the other scientist confused and irritated.

“What why?!”

“Theres a high chance he mustve been exposed to something dangerous we collected in the samples.”  she pointed to a screen and I slowly walked to it. I looked at the monitor that contained data of the samples we collected. Then pictures. 

“There's something in the samples but we cant figure out what. Adam got the data for us but then accidentally cut himself and afterwards he became stiff.”  After several slides my heart stopped to my stomach and i for the first time i felt genuine fear.

“Zoom in here.” i said pointing at the screen.

“What do you see?” i swallowed.

“Prions.” They all stared at me like I was a grim reaper.

“That c-c-cant be. They cant cause harm immediately after exposure.” My boss said

 “Mutation, possibly due to the radiation.”

Prions. Far more catastrophic than you can imagine. They're normally very rare and viruses are laughable compared to them. Its literally just a protein but far more deadly. And unlike viruses and bacteria there's no DNA or RNA that they have we use to study to find vaccines and treatments. Its neurodegenerative meaning it attacks the brain and the scariest part, they multiply by corrupting your own prions that are naturally found in your brain. There is no cure. No treatment. Extremely difficult to destroy and to prevent and can be found and survive anywhere. Since its not even alive it can survive deep in the soil and be carried by underground organisms. Only fire that can reach up to 1,800F (800C) and very strong solutions can completely destroy it. Meaning if it gets into the water systems, you cant destroy the prion infected water before you evaporate the water its in. And because these prions have mutated, who knows what theyre capable of now. Other than that it can completely paralyze you not even after a day if it gets into your system.

The government secretly issued an order to burn the entire site using pressurize industrial flamethrowers and our lab was wiped down with a powerful solution in addition to burning Adams body and our suits and samples.

Deep down I feel like this is only slowing down the inevitable. That was until we started hearing reports of people going stiff and dying. It’s starting. 

Actually… it already started before we even found them.
