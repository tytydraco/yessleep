Since I was a kid you could call me.. different..I had this Aunt (sister of my mom) who you could say was gifted.(Years later it ended up being schizophrenic although I think that's Just the term they gave her cause they couldn't explain it .)
I was really close to her, practically raised by her since my mom was working all day ..We come from the orthodox era and firmly believe in God and it's creatures..In my family it's me my mom , dad and my sister although only me and my Aunt have this 'thing'..

From when I was little she kept saying since I was her favourite I would inherit her "thing'' . I could see the figures of people that never  passed on the other side left wandering around the world in an attemp to ease themselves. you cant see their faces but only their shadows..  This 'thing'  tho has a set of rules going on for the figures you encounter..

Number1. You never look straight at them for a long time .

Number 2. You don't invite them in NEVER.

Number 3 . They can't harm you .. only scare you (unless you invite them in your home thus the number 2)

Number 4. If it goes too far pray and everything will be fine.

From times to times I would often see spirits in my dreams trying to come in my place in the form of my late grandpa or friendly figures even in the form of cats and dogs and other things .. the good part is that you could always sense that they are evil .. I don't know how it works really u just get it .. u sense the evilness in their eyes ,fun fact I am actually a lucid dreamer since childhood and could always control and alter my dreams.Although it didn't stuck to dreams only..

I remember one night I was casually playing in my computer (assemble gamers of reddit) and I heard footsteps and screaming from outside .. current time was 3 03 at night and I went on my balcony.. I saw in the wall figures of people running with wagons ,crying,screaming in a language I didn't know and never heard of ,little kids falling and being pressed to death by the feet of others and torches in the air . 
It was so loud I checked the other apartments but no one was out ..The road was empty and u couldn't see anything In miles except from me that could still see the figures in the wall  .. it was the first time that I froze and felt that I couldn't move ,tears where streaming down my face and I could barely breath by the smell of the torches in the air .. 

I closed my eyes and prayed thus falling into the ground and hitting my ankle . Everything went silent and I went back inside but  as soon as I closed the window the smell of the torch flattered my apartment and I could see visible smoke in the air.. I opened the window again and quietly went and covered myself in my blanket crying all night and praying..


My grandma came down the next morning woke me up and informed me that it was my time to deliver the koliva and bread (spiritual food we cook for the dead in Greece.) cause it was an all souls day and my uncles where waiting for me to deliver..

Of course no one believed me and laughed that I dreamed it but I know the truth and it's far from that maybe my" thing'' got triggered due to the day ..

I don't know who they where or why they where fleeing but I was sad for days and couldn't forget the cries,the trembling of the voices or the bones being crushed and the wagons wheels screeching..

Sometimes I still dream it...
