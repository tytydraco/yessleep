Since I was a kid you could call me.. different..I had this Aunt (sister of my mom) who you could say was gifted.Years later she got diagnosed as a schizophrenic although I think that's Just the term they gave her cause they couldn't explain what was going on with her.

I was always  really close to her, practically raised by her since my mom was working all day .Since i was little she kept saying that because I was her favourite I would inherit her gift. She could see the figures of people that never  passed on the other side left wandering around the world in an attemp to ease themselves. She told me that you cant see their faces but only their shadows although it has a set of rules going on when you encounter them for the sake of your sanity..

Number1. You never look straight at them for a long time .

Number 2. You don't invite them in NEVER.

Number 3 . They can't harm you .. only scare you (unless you invite them in your home thus the number 2)

Number 4. If it goes too far pray and everything will be fine.

I never really believed her till I started to see shadows following me around..lurking around me and from times to times I would often see them in my dreams at my doorstep  trying to come in..they were mostly friendly figures but it didn't matter cause  you could always sense the evilness in their eyes . Then it got worse..

I remember one night I was casually playing in my computer (assemble gamers of reddit) and I heard footsteps and screaming from outside , current time was 3 03 at night. 

As i went on my balcony figures started to project on the wall, people running with wagons mostly crying,screaming in a language I didn't know and never heard of ,little kids falling and being pressed to death by the feet of others and torches in the air moving forward..

It was so loud that nearly bleed my ears , I checked the other apartments but no one was out and the road Infront of me was empty,u couldn't see anything In miles but still the figures where moving and the noise wa deafening . 
For the first time in my life  I froze and felt that I couldn't move ,tears where streaming down my face and I could barely breath by the smell of the torches in the air .. 

I closed my eyes and prayed thus falling into the ground and hitting my ankle . Everything went silent and I went back inside trembling as the smell of the torch flattered my apartment and I could see visible smoke in the air..none of my family members had awaken tho or seem to locate my presence and I quietly went and covered myself in my blanket crying all night  till I fell asleep with the sun rising  

The following morning my grandma woke me up and informed me that it was my time to deliver the koliva and bread (spiritual food we cook for the dead in Greece.) cause it was an all souls day and my uncles where waiting for me to deliver . She asked if I had turn the fireplace on cause she smelled the fire and that I shouldn't light it at night cause it might burn the house if unattended..
