Anyone well-versed in the ocean knows there’s actually nothing statistically abnormal about the Bermuda Triangle. Anyone who’s ever sailed its waters knows that’s not entirely true. We all have our stories. Here’s mine, and I hope to hear yours.



That day our route from Miami to Biblo wasn’t anything usual. I had passed through the triangle before; the Delta Venus had made the trip before.



She was an old oil tanker. Plenty of leaks and rusty joints, but a sturdy ship. A reliable rust bucket. She had a crew of two dozen; I was the second mate. Thankfully too, without my recent promotion, I probably would have been down in the hold, and then I would not be telling you this story now.



That day was a stormy one. Our computers showed a large hurricane uncomfortably close along our route. Rather than a major reroute, the captain only adjusted our course. To attempt to slip by without slowing us down substantially.



I didn’t love it. I would have much preferred to take the safer option, but then again, I wasn’t the captain. It wasn’t my call to make.



That’s the problem with ships, really, the captain's word is absolute, even if he’s a moron.



A few hours later, the storm was predicted to be back in our path. The captain didn’t seem concerned, and so no one else was either. Again, he adjusted the route.



I remember the rain. A rain so powerful it would knock you down if you stood on the open deck. The waves were several feet high by this point, and our speed had slowed so much that we might as well have taken the detour.



The wind was so strong that it ripped my hair out of my ponytail when I briefly peeked outside. Suffice it to say, the weather was terrible.



Despite my protests, we pressed on; it was that or turning around. That’s how we ended up sailing directly into the hurricane.



It’s hard to channel the chaos that ensued into words. I was in my cabin sending a few emails when the wave hit. I didn’t see it, but I certainly felt it. The kind of wave that rocks the entire boat as it rolls over it. The ship listed, and I fell out of my chair as the ship groaned. The metal voiced its protest against the thousands of tons of water bashing it.



You can’t breathe in these situations, you instinctively hold your breath waiting for it to pass. Big waves hit ships; it’s not uncommon, but it’s never any less concerning, especially when the ship continues to list.



When you have a massive ship tilted at an angle, you know something is seriously wrong. I remember sitting on the floor and just thinking, “Oh shit.”



It was difficult to walk but not impossible, and I hurried to the bridge. The water practically poured down the hallway as I hurried as fast as I could, which only further scared me.



Lights were flashing, the rain splattering against the window made it impossible to make out anything, and people were yelling over the radio. It was total chaos. Definitely not something you ever want to experience while on a ship.



The ship jerked again as another large wave collided with it. Someone yelled, “We’re going down.” I don’t remember who.



The captain ordered everyone to abandon the ship. By now, the ship was listing so much that there was no way we were going to be able to properly deploy the lifeboats.



Still, it was our only option. I know it was selfish not to wait for anyone else. To just run as fast as I possibly could. But in the end, I was the only survivor, perhaps because of this.



Stepping out onto the deck was like stepping onto another planet. The wind pushed against me with such force that it nearly lifted me off the ground. The rain battered me through my raincoat, and I was instantly soaked. Instinctively, my body moved to curl up, to protect myself from this monsoon of violence and pain. Somehow, I managed to continue forward. 



I wasn’t walking so much as I was sliding. With the list, the water and the wind it was a miracle I made it there at all. The waves were massive against the sides of the ship. It would be impossible to swim, with waves several times my height rolling and crashing in the sea.



I collapsed into one of the rafts and frantically began trying to release it. With the list it was partially submerged, the entire ship was on the verge of tipping into the sea. The release mechanism was underwater, and brute forcing it was a struggle.



It was only then, as the first chain released, that I noticed the figure that had tried to follow me. Their voice was impossible to hear over the rain. I don’t know who it was under that large yellow raincoat, but there was nothing I could do as they fell overboard. They never resurfaced in the storm.



I grabbed the life jacket and finally released the second chain. The raft was immediately tossed against the side of the Delta Venus. The force of the water was like nothing I had ever felt before. So powerful was the storm that I can’t even tell you what happened next. 



One moment I’m being flung into the metal of the ship, the next I’m clawing my way to the surface and struggling into the life jacket. Somehow, I managed to hold onto it.



The life jacket did not make a difference. The storm was powerful enough to throw me every which way. Drowning and bludgeoning me. My fingers wrapped around the strap of the life raft, and I clung on for dear life. Adrenaline lets the body do truly impressive things; somehow, despite everything, I didn’t let go.



But I could feel my grip loosening and my strength in general. I had no idea of the world around me; I could see and hear nothing, and taste nothing but blood and salt. I did not know the state of the Delta Venus. All I could do was squeeze my eyes shut and try to breathe.



I don’t know how long I held on, but eventually, it stopped. Not the storm, not the pouring rain or the howling wind. Not the waves that tried to tear me away from my one beacon of hope. The raft stopped as if no longer floating in the water. 



I forced my eyes open out of confusion. What I was feeling no longer made sense. The sudden curiosity distracted me from what I thought was my impending doom.



To this day, I can’t believe what I saw. Maybe it was an illusion. I’m sure my claim will be scoffed at. Yet without the impossibility that I saw that day, I would not have survived the Bermuda Triangle.



It was a tentacle. Reddish and covered in suckers, a few feet long. It had wrapped around part of the small raft. At first, I thought some kind of giant squid had latched onto the boat. But that didn't explain how the raft was being supported.



Not wasting the opportunity, I pulled myself up and into the water-filled raft. Still a better situation than being on the outside. With the howling storm, I could still barely see a thing, but I know I saw. What was below, or what wasn't, more importantly.



The tentacle just went down. There was no body. Unlike the arms of a squid, the tentacle thickened and grew like that of an octopus as it descended towards an impossibly large body. What was inches thick on the surface grew thicker than a tree before I could see nothing more. Whatever this tendril belonged to, it would have been too vast for me to see its entirety at this distance had it not been obscured.



Every sailor knows the legend of the Kraken, and the Kraken it had to be. Deep-sea giganticism is a fascinating concept, but there was nothing scientific about what was down there. Nothing of this world, nothing that I wanted any part of. Life could grow majestically large but there was nothing right about what I saw.



Unable to stop myself, I reached out to touch it. It was warm under my fingers. Its flesh rippled as I ran my fingers over its smooth surface. I still don’t know what to make of it.



When the storm calmed, it slipped away back into the depths, leaving me there as the clouds parted to reveal the bright blue sky. By the time the helicopter found me, I was delirious from thirst but alive. Apparently, I was muttering about what I had seen, but I don’t much remember that.



I haven't dared step back on board a ship since then. I don’t really understand what happened, why such a being would stabilize my raft so I didn't drown. That's the only way I can see such an event. I’ve spent far too much time trying to puzzle through why. No one else on board the Delta Venus survived, and I shouldn't have. Yet I did, thanks to something I can’t even begin to understand, something I don’t dare to.



So while statistically there's nothing abnormal about the Bermuda Triangle, there's something down there. Something far greater than we can ever know. I don’t think we should be afraid. If that god ever wanted us to die, I doubt there would be anything we could do to stop it. We live because it lets us. One day, when the stars are right, and it’s time for the world to die, it will rise. But until then, it watches over us. At least it watched over me that day.



If you’re ever out on a boat and you feel its presence. Be not afraid. In the face of something so great, fear is an entirely useless emotion.
