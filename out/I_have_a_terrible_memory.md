I wasn’t always like this. When I was a kid, my mind was a steel trap. I could play whole movies in my head, line for line. I’d memorize novels for fun so I could “read” in the car without getting sick. We used to have contests at my school to see who could recite the most digits of pi, and I won every time.

I was up to 402 digits when my mom died.

Nobody tells you that depression affects your memory until it’s too late. First I was forgetting the names of my stuffed animals. My dad told me that was just a part of growing up, that toys shouldn’t matter as much to me anymore. Then I forgot his birthday. And I forgot it again, the year after that. And the year after that. Honestly, I don’t think he cared. He didn’t seem to have a lot to celebrate.

I went from a 4.0 to barely scraping by in school, and frankly, it’s a miracle I managed to get my diploma. My dream of going to a good college had fallen out from under me, and I had no choice but to keep living with my dad and get a job to support us. In between forgetting people’s orders and trying to remember when my shifts were, I met my angel.

Jordan hadn’t had a good life. His sister was killed when robbers broke into their house, and it had fractured something inside him. The long talks we had about our hardships made me understand, finally, what this “existence” thing was all about.

But turns out, love doesn’t solve all your problems. I tried to hide my memory (or lack thereof) from him, but it only took a few forgotten date nights before I knew I had to come clean. Thank god, he was ridiculously understanding. He even helped me figure out how to set reminders on my phone—which helped, when I remembered to set them.

On our one year anniversary, Jordan asked me to move in with him. I couldn’t say yes fast enough—especially since Dad had met someone recently. She was nice enough, when she wasn’t making subtle jabs about me still living at home. It was more than clear that she wanted me gone, and I was happy to oblige.

As I threw the last of my boxes into the trunk of my car, I went back inside to tell my dad I was ready to leave.

“I’m just glad the dumb bitch is finally getting out of the house.”

I froze. My dad’s girlfriend was in the kitchen, talking quietly on the phone.

“It’s bad enough that she didn’t even go to college, but I can’t believe she’s been taking advantage of her own father like this. He’s too nice of a guy to have a freeloader for a daughter.”

I saw red.

Yelling, accusations, a thrown glass. My dad running into the room, checking to see if his precious girlfriend was okay, without even looking at me. Me, trying to tell him what she’d said. His twisted glare in response.

“Your mother is dead, Kayla. This attitude isn’t gonna change that. Apologize, or leave.”

I sobbed as I drove to Jordan’s (our) apartment, alone.

—————————

A week later, Jordan and I cuddled on our bed-frame-less mattress, surrounded by half-emptied boxes. Our laughter at a compilation of cats falling over was interrupted by a faint thump from outside the door.

Jordan tensed.

“Baby, it’s okay,” I murmured, resting my hand on his arm. “It’s just a neighbor.”

**Bang bang bang.**

“…A very aggressive neighbor.”

Jordan’s eyes clouded over. I could tell his mind had taken him right back to his sister, to the robbery. He got up, opened the bottom dresser drawer, and pulled out a gun.

“Baby, wait, let’s just calm down—“

The sound of the lock clicking, the front door creaking open.

Jordan was gone before I could say another word. One single gunshot. Screams. Horrible, horrible screams.

…Familiar screams.

My phone dinged in my pocket. A reminder—one I’d accidentally set for 9 PM instead of 9 AM.

*Dad’s returning the spare key tonight*
