I have been struggling with this for a while now. I’m sure there’s nothing anyone else can do to help me, at least not until I’m ready to help myself, but I needed to get this all off my chest. And I have no one to talk to anymore. Except for my computer.

I have never been a social person, even when I was very young, but I finally managed to make a friend. Things were good for a while. He was cheerful and kind; an incessantly optimistic presence that split through the seemingly endless drone of melancholy that I have come to know. I have never invited another person to my home before, but he came and saw me regularly, especially when I would go through bouts of despair that kept me in my home for days on end. 



I’m not sure how he died. I don’t even remember who told me, but he’s gone now. Even if I hadn’t been told I would have figured it out. My doorbell hasn’t rung in weeks. His glasses are still on the windowsill from the last time he visited me. He’s always been so absent-minded, and I had always chastised him for it before. Now, I wish he’d forgotten more things here.



I haven’t left my house since I found out. The front door just seems so intimidating to me. Maybe because I keep expecting him to turn up on my porch and tell me there was a misunderstanding. I’m still waiting for him to come lift me out of this sadness, even though I know he won’t. At least, not the way I want him to. 



I honestly tried my best to keep in mind all the things he used to say to me. Even though I never saw any evidence of an afterlife or a departed person interacting with the living, I looked out for little things I could call signs; like when I was woken by the sunlight catching in my window just so perfectly that it cast a small rainbow across my face.



But it didn’t end with small things like that. Nor are they all so sweet or comforting. Whenever he used to visit I served him the same tea in the same mug. I made some of that tea one day, even though I never cared for it. I couldn’t bring myself to touch his mug. But while my back was turned to the cupboard, which I was sure I had closed, it pushed itself off the shelf and shattered on the floor. 



It felt like hours that I stood there and stared at it, like my heart was splattered across the tile instead of the faded rainbow ceramic. I ordered a new one online. I had to replace it or it was the same thing as admitting he wasn’t going to come back. That one ended up falling from the cupboard as well, and so did the third. I took the damn thing apart trying to figure out why they were sliding off the shelf, but I never figured it out. None of my other dishes ended up broken.



I had fallen asleep on the chaise lounge in the smaller drawing room and woke to the television suddenly switching on at full volume, blasting the theme song to his favorite cartoon. But as I sat there, breathing in short, sharp gasps, something went wrong with it. The art had dissolved into chaotic blocks of color smeared against the screen and the audio devolved to mechanical screeching and screams. It wouldn’t respond to the remote or even its buttons, so I had to unplug it from the wall. 



It kept escalating until I was hearing his voice in empty rooms and catching streaks of brightly colored clothing out of the corner of my eye. His presence isn’t reassuring at all. He seems agitated and frustrated. It feels like he’s stuck in this house with me. And I know him. If there is no other realm for his soul to go to and the dead still walk the Earth, he would much rather wander the world than stay in one spot, even with a friend. I fear that my fixation on him is keeping him trapped here. 



For some reason, his activity is the most noticeable in my computer room. I think it must be because we spent a lot of time in there together when he was alive. He played video games while I worked on my novels. Sometimes we played games together. 



He liked the retro consoles I have, especially the Atari that’s connected to a CRT monitor in the back of the room. He still sits in front of the old computer, staring straight ahead and not moving. I know because I see him in the glass. He looks so sad and I wish I could help him. 



The Atari turns on at random times, so does my computer and the flat screen on the other wall. I don’t have to be there for him to turn them on. I have to imagine that he’s bored, wishing he could play his favorite games, but he doesn’t seem able to. He only turns them on. Or he just sits and cries. I never saw him cry in life. 



I want to go. I want to let *him* go. But I just can’t. Instead, every day, I sit in front of that old chunky monitor, looking into that dark grey expanse and seeing him where my reflection ought to be.
