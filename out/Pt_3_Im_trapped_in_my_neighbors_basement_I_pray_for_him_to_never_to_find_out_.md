That was a day I'll never forget. I got up and for the first time in a long time, I felt my legs.

Getting up was harder than I thought it would be. It was even harder to start walking. My legs were very weak and thin, I tried to lean against the wall but falling down was inevitable.

I spent hours, maybe a day trying to stand up. I can't describe the happiness I felt when I was finally able to walk. 

I didn't care how much time had passed though. I could *walk*, and that was the only thing that mattered. I knew that somehow, if I could walk, *I could get out*.

It wasn't easy to get to the door. Its wooden surface warned me of its presence. To my surprise it wasn't locked. I know it's very suspicious, but in my euphoria I didn't notice. 

Anyways, who would notice? Who would notice if your freedom was so close? If your live was *that* close?

I have to admit, I've never been a stealthy person, and even less  if my mission involves stairs. It must be a superpower to walk silently, a superpower that obviously I don't possess. You can imagine what a disaster it must have been to climb up the stairs. 

Though It didn't matter how I did it. I didn't know it back then the fate that awaited me would be the same despite of my abilities to walk up the stairs.

When I got to the top, I found myself in a very modest room. There were almost no windows. Just a big red carpet, a small table and at the very back, a medium size sofa. 

A sofa with a man sitting on it, expectantly.

And no, it wasn't the man of the now maybe forgotten picture, because this one was at least  30 years younger. I'm almost sure it was his son. Same hair, same eyes.  Same perverted and demonic look. 

Yes, it was undoubtedly his son. And next to him, with an empty look, his mother,  now a living corpse. Just bones, almost no hair and empty eyes. Eyes of one who has seen hell.

As soon as the man stood up, I started to run. To run like a bat out of the frickin hell. To run as fast as my little legs would allow me to run. I was a deer and he was the hunter, the expert of the forest and predator. 

The advantage of starting to run first saved my life. Found a room, got inside and rapidly closed the latch. The man was banging on the door so hard that the whole room shook. Maybe even the whole house. 

I tried to look for any windows but there were none. If it wasn't for the monitor screen, there wouldn't even be any light. And believe me when I say, I wished there wasn't any.

The room was entirely upholstered with pictures and papers. Pictures and papers with the faces of different boys and girls, between the ages of 10-20. On the monitor, a file was open, ( definitely not from the nice part of the internet), with all my information,  photos and videos.

Unfortunately, I was not the only one who had a file, there were at least 50 with a similar structure and name. Each one had a date, ranging from 2012 to the present. It was literally a Wikipedia of kidnappings carried out by that monster.

We had all had our pictures taken in the basement, videos and so on. The content of the page was divided into chapters; a biography, method of abduction, the hostage stage itself (accompanied with very explicit video) and some notes made by the author: *Little Timmy*

I didn't have the courage nor guts  to watch any of the videos or pages. I think you all can guess of what they were about.

The most disturbing part of all, however, was the *final chapter* that every page but mine had. It was the most detailed and perverse of them all. I don't even want to recall the contents. They still hunt me to this day.

It took quite a long for little Timmy to realize his efforts to bust the door open with his bare fists were just hopeless and noisy. So when silence was heard, I got really scared.

I started looking for a "weapon". Either a pair of scissors or a sharpened pencil would be useful to defend myself in case he opened the door.

Fortunately, this had to be one of the best decisions I've ever made. In a drawer, under a pile of trash and papers, I found a metal object. Cold and polished, a gun. This was way better than winning the lottery.

I had never shot in my life, but it was that or to die. My pulse is honestly pretty bad, but I made an effort and aimed at the door, in the place where I thought his chest or maybe his head would be.

I know this is kinda off topic, but do you know the Shining? The Stephen's King Novel? The Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation? This guy must have been a Stan, because instead of looking for a key like any other normal human being would have, he started butchering the door with an axe. He was insane. He was a monster. A monster with a fucking axe.

Not only did I miss the shot, but I one of my eardrums exploted and my left shoulder got dislocated. It would have hurt more if it wasn't for the need to run away from that being. I leaned against the wall and fired again. 
 
Call it divine intervention or whatever, but miraculously the bullet hit him in the shoulder making him to drop the axe. It's funny because now none of use could do use of a shoulder.

I tried to run pass him, but little Timmy grabbed me by the arm and threw me to the ground. He then threw himself on top of me and both, the gun and the axe, were out of our reach.

At that moment I knew I was going to die. It was impossible to get out of his grip, he was 300 lbs monster and I just a 80 pnd teenager, luckily. 

At that moment I just wanted to die, my only wish was to never suffer again.

I gave up. I stopped fighting. I stopped moving. I just wanted to die and nothing else. I had already surrendered to my fate.

I was not going to give him the pleasure to see me cry. I wanted to,yes, but what good would it do me to cry? Everything happened for a reason, and if it hadn't worked out, there had to be a reason.

 A reason I never understood.

A gunshot woke me up from my trance. One shot made the whole weight of the man fall over me, suffocating me. When he started to spit blood on my face, I regained my strength and did whatever I could to get him off me.

There she was, lying on the floor with a terrible bruise on her forehead. The recoil from the shot had caused her to raise the gun and hit her head. 

There was no phone nearby to call 911 or emergency services.

I don't know why, but I wanted to help her one more time. Like the first time we met. I dragged her as best I could and put her on the couch. I asked her for a phone to call the ambulance, 911... she didn't answer.

I couldn't give up. She was still alive, she was still breathing... I could still save her. 

 I looked all over the house to find a way to call an ambulance. After searching for a while, I found a cell phone in the kitchen. I called 911 telling them  my grandma fell or something. I didn't want to tell them the real story yet because precious time was running out.

They said they would be there in five minutes. 

We only had to hold on for five minutes.

She didn't seem relieved or excited to get out of there. She just looked at me. Her eyes with no shine nor light in them 

*Let me die...*

I thought my ears were deceiving me. 

I couldn't have been hearing right. 

*Let me die...*

Her voice, cracking because of the pain, was barely audible.

*let me die...*

A tear spilled down her face her face.

*Let me die...*

*Please*
