My 8yr old, Morgan, is a handful to begin with! What young, boisterous child wouldn't be a handful to his parents! My daughter is the same way, but she is easier to handle. 

Their mom and I work two full time jobs, and have non conflicting schedules so we get to see the little hellions when we get home!

Our home life is very relaxed, with the normal happiness that goes on, they have their toys, and we as parents break up the fights if those happen!

One night in early June, moths came to to me and said that he had made a new friend, and I was happy for him.

"Whose this new friend of yours!?" I asked, with a cocked eyebrow

"He's an older kid, I don't know his name, but he lives near us!" He said, with a wild look

I gave him the usual fatherly mantra of being safe and all that and he ran off to play on the trampoline with his sister as I got dinner prepared!

The rest of the night went sound as ever, kids went to bed and I settled into a paranormal show as I wound down from work!


I'm a firm believer that there is life after death, and we can have those events, even if we don't expect them right in our own home!

The next few days went by fairly straightforward, no instances of the friend or him mentioning it! 

On a Thursday evening, Morgan asked if his new friend could come over, me and the girlfriend talked it over and agreed he could! The next day, we could hear Morgan in his room, talking to someone! 

"Who are you talking to? The wall!?" I chuckled, not seeing anyone!

"My friend, he's over there next to my RC car! He's saying hello to you!" He said happily

I waved back, not giving it a second thought, knowing he's got an imaginary friend!

I got dinner ready and called them up!

"Is your friend staying for dinner?" I asked

"No, he had to go home for dinner himself!" He said, sitting down as I plated dinner

As I got them ready for dinner, I noticed Morgan had a scratch on his back, two LONG marks running his spine!


"Dude, what happened!? You got scratched by something!"

"I didn't feel anything!" He said, with a worried look

"Alright, get to bed! It'll be better in the morning!" I said, rushing them off to their rooms

The next morning, It didn't get better! He woke up with bruises up and down his legs, and the scratches got deeper!

"Morgan, what in the world!"

In all honesty, he looked like had been punched, scratched and bit! I kept him from school that day, because I didn't want to deal with an upset teacher or get the CPS people called for abuse!

We hungout that whole day, just doing small things but not causing any trouble! As he went down for a nap, I noticed a change in him! He was acting scared, not wanting to leave my side!

"Dad, he's here!" He said, with a shakiness to his voice

"WHO'S here?" I retorted, looking puzzled

"My friend! He's not nice to me! He's the one leaving the injuries!"

"Ah, why didn't you tell me? I could've handled that!" I said, laughing a bit

"I didn't want you to be scared or think I was crazy!" Almost crying over his words

"You are already crazy as is! This isn't crazy!"

I told him to go lay down for his nap on the couch and I would watch for his friend, knowing I couldn't see this "friend", but now knowing he's let something in I have to banish if it gets any worse!

In that moment,  he woke up SCREAMING, pointing to his chest, gasping for air!

"HE'S SITTING ON ME!" he yelled, trying to get air

Knowing I had some holy water in the kitten somewhere, I dashed for the kitchen, but something blocked me and I couldn't pass the threshold!

"Either you get off him, or I'll do it the way you don't want it to go!" I snapped, knowing it could hear me! 

He finally go air, gasping and looking at me like he seen a ghost 

"That wasn't him dad, he changed! I'm scared now!" He cried, only knowing that I'm the one who's going to have to get rid of it

That night, I told them to sleep in the living room and I was going to have a talk with this "friend"!

"You are going to get yourself hurt!" My girlfriend snapped

"He's got to go and I'll make him!" I snapped back

I walked downstairs and was met with a heavy, sticky feeling like I've never experienced,  and there was his "friend", horns and all, sitting in a recliner in the basement

"You need to go,  this isn't a place for you to be! He a weak child, if you want to pick on someone your size, do it! Leave him alone!" I said, not knowing I marked myself!

The figure stood up out of the chair, walked over and raised a single finger at me! He pointed that finger and all the breath in my lungs left for almost a minute!

"If you want a fight, I'm here!" It growled, releasing its hold on me

I raised the bottle of holy water! It retreated, and I knew I had to get Morgan involved!

"Morgan, come here NOW!" I yelled, and he came running! "You need to tell him to leave, I have him held off!"

"How dad? I'm scared!" I knew now he can also see him

"You've yelled at me! Do it like you've done at me but instead of me punishing you,  you punish him! Stand your ground"! I said

"OK, I'll try!" He whined 


"Hurry!! I whispered 


"You don't belong here! This is my house! Stop hurting me!" He yelled, as he grabs on to me

"I'll be back, this war isn't over!" Said the figure, as it dissipated into the night!

We haven't had anything new happen since then! Morgan's been better as school and he's happy! Life went back to normal, KINDA!

Three weeks later, we were all getting ready for bed and I happened to notice two strange punctures on my body near my shoulder! I turned, and could only gasp as I saw the two deep marks! 

He's back, and now I'm the victim!
