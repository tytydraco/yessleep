I’m writing this at my aunt’s kitchen table with my duffel bag sitting by the door and a cold slice of pizza going soggy on a paper plate next to me.

If my parents call, I’m not picking up. I already told them I’m not coming home for Thanksgiving. Not tonight, not tomorrow, maybe not ever.

I know how dramatic that sounds. I’m seventeen, not seven. I’m supposed to roll my eyes at family drama and get over it.

But last year, the night before Thanksgiving, something walked me home.

And I don’t mean that in the cute “guardian angel” way adults use when they talk about near misses on the highway.

I mean something followed me, herded me, and tried to make sure I didn’t make it back at all.

We live in a small town off Exit 23, outside Albany. My parents moved us there when I was in middle school for “fresh air and a good school district.” It’s mostly trees, a strip mall, a Stewart’s, and the kind of old houses people hang American flags on year-round until they’re sun-bleached.

The only thing that ever felt unique about the place was the story everyone told in November.

They called him the Buckled Man.

The first time I heard it was in sixth grade during a lock-in at the community center. Lights off, sleeping bags everywhere, kids wired on Mountain Dew and Red Vines from the vending machine. It was around one in the morning. One of the counselors, a college kid named Eric, started telling us “local history.”

That’s what he called it. Not a ghost story. “Local history with a warning.”

He said back when the town was just a cluster of farms and a church, there was a man named Gideon Yates. Gideon was a veteran from “the war back then” (which one changed depending on who told it) and supposedly walked home from battle to find his family had moved away without leaving word.

No one invited him in that first winter. Not for Sunday dinners, not for the harvest feast, not even for Thanksgiving. They were “all full up,” they said. “No room at the table.”

That night, a snowstorm rolled in. The story says Gideon wandered house to house in the dark, knocking and begging to be let in. Everyone pretended not to hear him.

In the morning, they found him frozen in the middle of his field, dressed in his Sunday clothes and the black coat he wore to church. His hat was tipped over his face. His boots were lined up neat at the front door of his house.

The houses that had turned him away started having accidents after that. A child went missing walking home from a neighbor’s. A man bled out from a “farming tool mishap.” A woman was found in the well. Every year, always right around Thanksgiving.

Kids said Gideon came back as the Buckled Man. That he walked the back roads and fields in a long black coat with old-fashioned buckles on the shoes and hat. That he hated empty chairs and full tables. That if you left a seat open on purpose—because you didn’t want someone there, because they “weren’t welcome”—he’d come the night before Thanksgiving and take someone to fill it.

Adults rolled their eyes when we brought it up. “It’s just a story about hospitality and gratitude,” my mom said once, rinsing dishes. “A scare tactic from back when people had to rely on each other to survive winter.”

For years, that’s all it was. A story. Something kids whispered on the school bus or used to dare each other into walking past the empty field on Yates Road.

Then last year happened.

The fighting started early that week.

It was about my Uncle Mark.

He’s my mom’s older brother. He used to come over every Thanksgiving with his wife and little boy. Then he started drinking too much. Not just beer during the game, but showing up with a flask, taking “bathroom breaks” every twenty minutes, coming back red-eyed and loud.

Two years ago, he started a fight with my dad. Threw a chair, smashed some dishes, knocked my little cousin’s plate right off the table. My parents cleaned up the mess and swore that was it.

“He’s not welcome here anymore,” my dad said. “Not until he gets help.”

I understood at first. I saw my baby cousin hiding under the table, shaking. I heard my mom crying later in the bathroom with the fan on.

But this year, Uncle Mark called me himself. Slurred, yeah, but crying. He left this long voicemail about how he was “trying real hard” and just wanted to see the family.

“Please, kiddo. Talk to your mom for me. I just want my seat back one more year.”

He called me “kiddo” like when I was ten and he took me fishing. That messed with me.

I made the mistake of playing the voicemail on speaker at dinner.

My dad shut it off halfway through. “He’s not coming, Kyle,” he said. “We already talked about this.”

“We could… we could invite him and just tell him he can’t drink?” I said. I knew how dumb that sounded as I said it.

My mom shook her head. “You don’t tell an alcoholic ‘just don’t drink.’ It doesn’t work like that.”

“So you’re just going to pretend he doesn’t exist? Leave his seat empty and act like—”

“We’re not leaving it empty,” my dad snapped. “We’ll move things around.”

They didn’t, though.

The next morning, I walked past the dining room and saw the table already half set. My mom likes to do that early so she’s not scrambling on the actual day. The good tablecloth was out. Turkey-shaped napkin rings from when I was in kindergarten that still have my fingerprints baked into the paint. A line of plates.

There was still a chair at the end of the table. The folding one my uncle always used, right by the wall. No plate in front of it yet. Just blank table.

I stopped in the doorway. “I thought you were moving that chair.”

“I will,” Mom said. “I just haven’t decided how I want people seated yet.”

“You said you weren’t leaving an empty seat.”

“It’s not empty, Kyle.” She gave me that tight smile she uses when she’s trying not to argue. “I’m still figuring it out. Please drop it.”

I didn’t. Not really. I muttered about it on my walk to work, under my breath on the CDTA bus. Some guy in a Carhartt beanie looked at me like I was crazy.

When my shift lead at the grocery store asked how I was doing, I actually said, “My family’s trying to get me killed by a pilgrim ghost.”

He laughed. “What, you finally learned the Buckled Man story?”

“It’s not funny. They’re literally leaving an empty chair.”

He shrugged. “Then maybe don’t go home tonight.”

He meant it as a joke. I laughed like it was one.

I work part-time at Greene’s Market. It’s the only full grocery store in town unless you count the Dollar General. The day before Thanksgiving is hell there. Lines down every aisle, people yelling about pie crusts, some lady crying because we ran out of canned yams, everyone insisting their emergency is the worst.

The store plays this awful loop of holiday songs—“All I Want for Christmas Is You” starting up before we even clear Halloween. By that night, I wanted to rip the speakers out of the ceiling.

My shift started at two in the afternoon and was supposed to end at eight.

By nine-thirty, I was still there, restocking cranberry sauce on Aisle 4 and stacking frozen turkeys in a big cardboard display shaped like a pilgrim hat while my manager muttered about no-shows.

My phone kept buzzing in my pocket.

Mom: You okay?
Mom: Roads are getting icy. Dad can swing by.
Mom: Kyle? Answer please.

I sent a quick: Still here. I’ll walk. It’s fine.

It’s not that far. A ten-minute walk if I cut behind the strip mall and took the path through the woods instead of following the main road around. I’d done it a thousand times. Literally, like three or four times a week since sophomore year.

At 9:45, my friend Dani texted.

Dani: u off yet
Me: almost
Dani: don’t forget who walks tonight ;)
Me: stfu
Dani: u know the rules. empty chair = buckled man patrol. stay on the main road

I sent back a turkey emoji and one of those skulls and put my phone away.

We closed at ten. Fluorescent lights off, security gates down, doors locked. The parking lot thinned to just employee cars and a few last-minute shoppers hustling out with plastic bags.

My dad texted again as I stepped outside.

Dad: I’m already in the car. 5 minutes.
Dad: Don’t walk.

The air hit me like a slap. Sharp, wet cold that cut straight through my hoodie. You could see your breath. The sky was clouded over, low and heavy. The wind kicked little scraps of receipt paper and dead leaves across the asphalt.

“Hey.” My manager, Raj, flicked his lighter and cupped his hand around a cigarette. He always smells like coffee and Marlboros. “You need a ride?”

“Nah, my dad’s coming,” I lied. “He’s already on his way.”

“You sure? Roads are crap. People drive worse when they’re stressed.”

“I’m good. Thanks, though.”

He nodded, pulled his coat tighter, and headed for his Corolla.

I watched his taillights fade as he pulled out of the lot. It was just my breath and the hum of the parking lot lights then. The distant whine of a truck on the main road. Two shopping carts someone hadn’t brought in, bumping gently against each other.

Somewhere, the timer on the deli oven beeped twice and then shut off. The sound echoed weirdly in the empty front end.

I stood there a second longer than I needed to.

I don’t know why I changed my mind. Maybe it was stubbornness. Maybe it was the thought of sitting in a warm car with my dad in silence, both of us pretending we hadn’t been fighting about his brother all week.

Maybe a part of me wanted to prove I wasn’t scared of some old story.

I typed out a new text.

Me: Nvm I’ll just walk. It’s like ten mins.

I dropped my phone back into my pocket before the “…” even popped up.

I cut across the back of the parking lot, past the dumpsters where the light doesn’t reach as well. The asphalt back there is cracked and broken, weeds punching through. Somebody had dumped a busted pumpkin there that was still half-frozen to the ground. The air smells like rotting produce and burnt oil.

Halfway past the dumpsters, I heard a sound.

It was small. A scrape and a soft clink. Metal on pavement.

I stopped. Turned my head.

One of the carts rocked on its wheels, nudged by the wind. A loose can rolled against a dumpster.

I told myself that was it. Just the wind and the can.

Then something stepped into the edge of the light.

It was just at the border where the parking lot glow fades and the dark from the tree line begins. A shape. Tall. Still.

I couldn’t make out a face. Just the outline of a long coat and a wide-brim hat. For a second, the light hit something on the hatband. A small square of shine. A buckle.

I blinked hard and it was gone. Just the tree line again. Shadows and branches.

My heartbeat kicked up. My jaw clenched. The sensible thing would’ve been to turn around, go wait by the front of the store where the cameras and lights were, call my dad like he’d been telling me to.

Instead, I told myself, It’s a branch, an afterimage, stop freaking out, and kept walking.

I crossed the loading zone, stepped up over the broken curb, and slipped between two scraggly bushes onto the path.

Behind Greene’s, there’s a narrow trail people made from walking the same shortcut for years. It goes downhill behind the strip mall, through a stretch of woods, and comes out on Yates Road on the other side.

That road is the closest one to my house.

The trail was soft under my sneakers, dead leaves and old mud. The trees blocked most of the streetlight. My eyes adjusted slowly as I went. Tree trunks, low branches, the dark drop of the ravine to my right where the creek runs in spring and smells like wet pennies.

My breath sounded too loud. The wind in the bare branches sounded like whispering.

After maybe a minute, I heard that sound again.

Scrape. Clink.

This time behind me.

I froze. Listened.

At first there was only my own breathing and the wind fussing with the leaves.

Then, soft and distinct, I heard it again. A step. The weight of a boot on cold ground. Then another. Slow. Even.

I turned and squinted back the way I’d come.

Something stood where the trees met the edge of the parking lot. Taller than me. Shoulders a little hunched. Coat hanging down past the knees. Wide brim of a hat pulled low.

It was too far to see a face. The main thing I saw was the way the hatband caught what little light there was.

A dull, square gleam at the center. Like a buckle.

“Hello?” My voice came out sharper than I meant. “Raj? Is that you?”

No answer. No one stepped closer or moved away.

“Seriously, this isn’t funny.”

The shape didn’t react.

My throat went dry. I told myself it could be anyone. A random guy cutting through. A homeless person. One of the older kids from school with a hat and a coat trying to scare me because they saw me closing.

In stories, the stupid character always goes closer to check. I didn’t. I turned and started walking faster.

The trail bent left and right. Roots rose and fell underfoot. My breath came in shorter bursts as I sped up. I tried to keep it quiet, which just made me more aware of every exhale.

About thirty seconds later, I heard him again.

Scrape. Thud.

Bootsteps, slow and steady, matching my pace.

I sped up more. So did he.

The problem with that path is there’s no easy way off it. The ravine and creek cut deep on one side, and on the other, there’s a steep slope packed with underbrush and broken branches. You can climb it if you really need to, but not fast, and not quietly.

I pulled my phone out without looking and jabbed at the screen. I didn’t care who I called anymore. My dad, my mom, Dani, 911—anyone.

The screen stayed black.

I held the power button.

Nothing.

The cold must’ve killed it. It had thirty percent when I clocked out. Now it was a dead brick in my hand, not even the little battery icon.

“Come on,” I muttered. “Come on, come on—”

Behind me, the steps kept coming. Not rushing me. Not running. Just staying the same distance back.

I glanced over my shoulder.

He was closer now. I could see the coat better. Long, old-fashioned, the kind with buttons that go all the way up. The hat sat low over the face.

In his right hand, something glinted pale. For a second, I thought it was a knife. Then I realized it was longer. A fork.

A big, two-pronged carving fork.

Everything in me went cold in a different way.

I stopped pretending it was anything normal.

I jumped off the trail, my shoes sliding on damp leaves as I scrambled up the slope. Branches whipped my face. One caught my cheek and left a hot, stinging line. I grabbed at saplings and exposed roots and hauled myself up until I crested the top and rolled onto the edge of a field.

Yates Field.

You can tell because of the rock. It’s just sitting there near the tree line. A big slab of stone with a metal plaque about “original homestead of Gideon Yates” and “founder of the township,” the dates all rubbed at by kids’ fingers and weather.

Kids throw beer cans at it in the summer. People leave pumpkins on it in the fall until the deer get them.

The field itself was rough, dead grass and patches of old corn stubble. It sloped up toward a dark shape in the distance: the skeleton of the Yates farmhouse.

The house had been abandoned as long as I could remember. A sagging two-story thing with broken windows and a front porch that looked ready to collapse.

My chest tightened when I saw it. Every story I’d ever heard about the Buckled Man sat in the back of my throat.

Don’t go past the field on the night before Thanksgiving.
Don’t leave an empty chair.
Don’t answer if someone knocks after midnight.

I pressed myself flat to the ground and looked back over the edge of the hill.

The Buckled Man had stepped off the trail and was standing at the bottom of the slope, looking up.

I should’ve been able to see his face. I couldn’t. It was just darkness under the brim. But I could see the line of his shoulders, the slow rise and fall of his chest.

He lifted his head a little, like he was smelling the air.

Then he started up the hill toward me. Same slow, measured steps. The carving fork hung from his hand, catching faint bits of light.

I scrambled to my feet and ran.

The dead grass was slick with frost. My sneakers didn’t grip well. I slid and stumbled more than I actually sprinted, but I kept moving forward until my lungs burned.

The house loomed bigger with every step. Up close, it felt less like a building and more like a dead thing hunched in the field. The front door hung crooked on broken hinges. One of the front windows was boarded up; the others were just black.

I veered left at the last second, thinking I’d go around it, cut toward the road.

That’s when I saw the fence.

Someone had put up a line of metal posts and rusted wire along the far edge of the property. Not a solid fence—more like the start of one. But it was enough to slow me down, to scratch my hands as I grabbed and lifted the wire, to snag my jacket when I tried to duck under.

By the time I pulled free, I heard him again.

Closer now. On the porch.

The boards creaked under his weight. One. Two. Three steps. The sound of the carving fork gently tapping wood, like he was dragging the tines along the railing just to hear the noise.

I pressed myself against the side of the house, out of sight of the front. My breath came in sharp, loud gulps that I tried to smother with my sleeve.

“Everyone eats.”

The voice was low and dry. Not quite a whisper, not quite normal. It came from the front of the house, just around the corner.

“Everyone eats,” the voice said again. Like he was reciting something. “No empty chairs.”

He was talking to someone. Or to himself. Or to whoever he thought I was.

I took a slow step sideways, trying to edge away from the sound.

The porch boards creaked again. The steps were moving toward the corner.

There was a side door halfway down the house. I’d seen it before in daylight, driving past with my mom. The paint long gone, the frame soft. Now, in the dark, it gaped open a few inches. Black inside, but open.

I had two choices. Run back out into the field and hope I could outrun him in a straight line, or duck into the house and pray he went around the other way first.

The thought of stepping into that house made my stomach twist, but the idea of crossing that field again with him behind me made my legs lock.

I grabbed the handle and slipped inside.

The smell hit me first.

Old wood. Wet plaster. Something sour under it, like garbage that got wet and dried and got wet again.

The floor under my shoes felt uneven. I reached for the wall and found peeling wallpaper. My eyes strained in the dark until shapes came into focus.

A hallway. A doorway on the left opening into what might’ve been a kitchen. On the right, another room with what looked like a toppled bookshelf.

I heard the front door groan open.

“Everyone eats,” the Buckled Man said again, now inside the house. Closer. “Everyone gets a plate. Everyone gets a seat.”

His footsteps were slow. Heavy. Coming closer.

I slipped into the room on the left and froze.

A table filled most of the space. Not a dusty, rotten one. A cheap folding banquet table someone had set up recently.

On it:

Paper plates. Plastic cups. Two unlit candles stuck into old green candleholders. A grocery store turkey in its plastic bag, still raw, sitting in a roasting pan. Tins of instant mashed potatoes and stuffing. Cans of cranberry jelly. A bag of dinner rolls with the Greene’s price sticker still on them.

Every item had a sticky note in front of it with a name written in careful block letters.

“Mom.”
“Dad.”
“Grandma.”
“Me.”

I froze when I saw the last one.

“Kyle.”

The note sat in front of an empty, clean plate.

My plate.

My legs went weak. I put a hand on the back of one of the chairs to steady myself.

Something crinkled under my fingers.

I looked down.

The chairs around the table weren’t old farmhouse chairs. They were mismatched kitchen chairs. An office rolling chair with the fake leather flaking. A folding metal chair. Tied to the back of each one with twine were photographs.

Some printed on regular paper. Some glossy. Some ripped from family holiday cards.

In every picture, a Thanksgiving table.

Different families. Different houses. Different dishes. But always the same thing: a table full of people, everyone smiling at the camera.

On some, faces were crossed out with a black marker. On others, someone was circled.

My hand shook as I flipped through them.

Neighbors. People I recognized from school. People I’d seen in town in the cereal aisle.

Then I saw my family.

The photo was from three years ago. My mom had it framed on the mantle for a while. We were all squished around the table, me in a gray hoodie, my mom laughing, my dad pretending not to laugh, my little cousin with mashed potatoes on his shirt. Uncle Mark on the end, holding up his glass.

In this version, someone had drawn a thick, black X over my uncle’s face.

And a neat circle around mine.

I still know the exact way my own face looks in that circle. I’ve seen it enough in my head.

Footsteps sounded in the hallway.

“Smells good,” the Buckled Man said. “Smells like a full table. Smells like no one left out in the cold.”

They were slow. Heavy. Coming closer.

I slid down off the chair and crawled under the table. The floor was gritty with dirt and crumbs. I could see boots now at the doorway.

They were old-fashioned, square-toed, with tarnished buckles across the top. Dark leather cracked at the seams. Mud crusted around the soles.

He stepped into the room, and the whole table shook with his weight.

“I like this house,” he murmured. “I like a house that remembers. I like a table that’s ready.”

He walked slowly around the table, fingers trailing along the back of each chair. When he reached the one with my photo, he stopped.

“There’s my seat,” he said softly. “There’s my guest of honor.”

The carving fork clicked gently against the chairback.

I clamped a hand over my mouth.

“Come out, Kyle.”

He said my name like he’d been saying it all his life.

“I set a place for you. Your family didn’t.” The chair creaked as he pushed it in a little. “They left you out here, all alone. Didn’t move the chair. Didn’t set the plate. Didn’t keep the rules.”

He started walking again, slower now, listening.

“You know the rules, don’t you? You and your friends whisper them every year. You think they’re just a story.” He paused on the far side of the table. “Everyone eats. Every seat filled. No one turned away.”

He stopped directly across from where I hid.

The boots turned toward me.

I could see the hem of the coat now. Heavy fabric, stiff with age and grime. Dark stains along the edge, flaking at the creases.

The carving fork lowered until the tines hovered above the floor near my face.

“You came all this way,” he said. “Would be rude not to sit down.”

I exploded sideways before I could think.

I rolled out from under the table on the far side, grabbed the nearest chair, and flung it in his direction without looking.

It hit something solid with a loud crack. The fork clattered to the floor.

I ran.

Back into the hallway, toward where I thought the back of the house might be. My shoulder hit a doorframe. Pain shot down my arm. I staggered, bounced off the opposite wall, kept going.

Behind me, I heard the table screech and a low grunt.

“You run,” he said. “They all run.”

I don’t remember choosing to go down the stairs. One second I was in the hall, the next my foot found empty space and I was skidding down steep, narrow steps into the dark.

I hit the bottom hard enough that my teeth rattled. My ankle twisted. For a second, I lay there in the cold, dusty air, listening to my own wheezing and a faint hum from somewhere—maybe the extension strip.

Then I heard him again.

The slow thump of boots on stairs.

I pushed myself up.

The basement smelled worse. Damp concrete. Old mold. Something metallic that sat on the back of my tongue.

There was just enough light leaking through a tiny, ground-level window for me to make out shapes.

A workbench with tools hung neatly above it. Hooks hanging from a ceiling beam. Chains. A stained plastic folding table with an electric carving knife on it, the cord winding to an orange extension strip.

The hooks weren’t empty.

One had what looked like a whole, plucked turkey hanging from it, skin yellow and bumpy under the weak light. Next to it, something smaller. A shape about the size of a cat, skinless and pink, head missing.

Under that, on the floor, a single child’s sneaker. Muddy, the Nike logo half peeled off.

I swallowed something sour.

Boots hit the bottom step behind me.

“Basement’s best,” he said. “Nice and cool. Quiet. No one hears anything over the holiday noise upstairs.”

I lunged for the far wall. There was a low, square hole there. A coal chute. The wooden panel that had once covered it was half off, hanging by one rusted hinge. The opening wasn’t big, but I’m not huge. I dropped to my stomach, shoved the panel up with my shoulder, and wriggled through.

The concrete scraped my back. Nails snagged my clothes. I kicked and pushed until my shoulders wedged on the edges. For a panicked second I was stuck in the tight space.

Then I heard the carving fork scrape against the floor behind me.

“You don’t have to go,” he said. Closer now. “You just have to sit. One plate. One night. Then everyone’s even again.”

I screamed and kicked hard. Something tore—my jacket, my shirt, my skin—I don’t know. Suddenly I was free, tumbling onto cold, wet dirt outside.

I scrambled to my feet and ran.

The coal chute opened on the far side of the house, down in a little hollow. Dead leaves had collected there, matted with ice. The night air hit my scraped back and made it burn.

I sprinted up out of the hollow and into the field.

For a second, everything was open again. The sky dark overhead. The town’s distant streetlights a faint glow. Wind cutting through my torn clothes.

Behind me, I heard a hollow thud as something hit the coal chute from the inside.

Then the scrape of boots on concrete. Then on dirt.

I didn’t look back.

I ran straight for the road.

My ankle screamed with every step. My lungs burned. My side stabbed. I could feel blood running down my back in thin lines, soaking into my waistband.

I crashed through the tall grass and hit the ditch before the road without seeing it. My feet went out from under me. For a second I was in the air, then I hit muddy water and cold stones shoulder-first.

The shock of it stole my breath. The world shrank to the sound of my own gasp.

I pushed myself up on hands and knees and clawed my way up the far side of the ditch.

A pair of headlights washed over me.

I threw up my hands, blinking against the brightness.

Brakes squealed. A horn blared.

The car stopped a couple feet short of me.

The driver’s door flew open. “What the hell—Kyle?”

It was my dad.

He was out of the car and at my side in seconds, grabbing my shoulders, turning me to check for injuries.

“What are you doing?” he shouted. “What were you thinking, running into the road like that? You could’ve—Jesus.”

His hands came away dark from my back. For a second, he just stared at them.

“What happened?”

“He—” My throat seized. I coughed and spat mud and bile into the ditch. “He followed me. From the store. Through the woods. The house—there was a table—”

I turned back toward the field.

The farmhouse sat there, dark and still. No lights in the windows. No shape on the hill. The coal chute barely visible as a darker patch near the foundation.

The field was empty.

“Who?” my dad demanded. “Who followed you?”

“The Buckled Man,” I said before I could stop myself. “He said—he set a place—he knew my name. He had pictures, Dad. He had our picture. He circled me.”

My dad stared at me like I’d started speaking another language.

Then something changed in his face. Just a flicker.

“Get in the car,” he said. “Now.”

He kept glancing past me at the field like he expected something to step out of it.

The rest of the night is a blur of bright lights and questions.

My mom cried and kept touching my face like she needed to make sure it was still there. My dad called the cops. They came, took statements, took pictures of the cuts on my back and the mud on my clothes.

One of the officers wrote “possible fall injury” on his notepad before I even finished talking.

Two officers drove out to Yates Field to check the house.

They came back about an hour later. The TV was still on mute in the living room, showing some late-night infomercial about knives, which felt like a bad joke.

“Basement had some old tools,” one of them said. “Some hooks, probably for hanging game. Nothing unusual for a farmhouse out here. No fresh food, no photos, nothing like what you described. Just junk.”

“That’s impossible,” I said. My voice sounded thin. “It was there. The table was set. There were plates, names—”

“Kid, we looked,” he said. “Top to bottom. House is falling in on itself, but there’s nothing in there you need to worry about.”

He gave me the careful look adults give when they think you’re lying or hysterical but don’t want to say so.

“Probably a trespasser messing with you,” he added. “Someone heard the local legend and wanted to scare kids. You were running in the woods in the dark. Adrenaline does weird things to your memory.”

I wanted to scream.

Instead, I sat there on the couch, wrapped in a blanket that smelled like our attic, feeling every cut on my back itch and sting. My dad kept pacing. My mom made tea and forgot to drink hers.

After the officers left, my parents went into the kitchen and had the quietest, angriest fight I’ve ever heard.

I didn’t catch every word. I caught enough.

“You told him that story when he was little, what did you expect?” my dad hissed. “Now some lunatic’s using it.”

“This isn’t about a story!” my mom snapped back. “This is about you refusing to see that your brother—”

“He threw a chair at our son, Marie!”

“And now our son is bleeding because you didn’t move a damn chair!”

Silence. Then my dad, low: “You think this is my fault?”

A cabinet door shut too hard. A mug rattled in the sink.

I went upstairs before I had to hear more.

I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the boots at the edge of the table. The fork lowering toward my face. My name on that sticky note.

At some point, maybe around three in the morning, I heard it.

Three slow knocks on the front door.

Not loud. Not frantic. Just firm.

My parents must’ve heard it too. I heard my dad’s steps on the stairs, then my mom’s soft protest.

“Don’t,” she whispered. “Don’t answer.”

“It’s probably the officers,” my dad said. “Maybe they forgot something.”

The front door creaked open.

Silence.

Then my dad’s voice, sharp. “Hello?”

More silence.

The door closed again.

He came back upstairs a minute later. I cracked my bedroom door and peeked out.

“Who was it?” my mom asked.

“No one,” he said. He looked pale. “Probably kids. No one on the porch.”

He avoided my eyes. He does that thing where he rubs the bridge of his nose when he’s lying. He was doing that.

The next day, my mom moved the folding chair from the end of the table. She put it in the garage. She set the table for three instead of four.

She called my Uncle Mark and invited him for “dessert and coffee sometime next week.” Not Thanksgiving. Not dinner. A compromise.

He didn’t come.

Every year before that, Thanksgiving smelled like turkey and pie and sounded like football and laughter and my mom yelling at my dad about using the good knife on the carving board.

Last year, it tasted like cold gravy and fear.

I picked at my food and watched the front door.

I slept with my bedroom door locked for months. I still do.

I know what people are going to say.

Stress. Family drama. Darkness. Overactive imagination. Urban legend in my head. Every year, kids around here swear they see someone on the side of the road in a long coat near Thanksgiving.

Maybe that’s all it is.

But here’s what hasn’t gone away:

The scars on my back from where the coal chute ripped my skin. They’re crooked and shiny and I see them every time I forget and take my shirt off in front of the bathroom mirror.

The way my phone, which had thirty percent battery when I left the store, wouldn’t turn on again until the next morning, and then suddenly booted up like nothing happened.

The report my dad found buried in the town archive when he couldn’t sleep one night. An old clipping about a man named Gideon Yates found dead in his field, “frozen in the posture of supplication,” and a side note about “local superstitions regarding holiday hospitality.” He didn’t show me the whole article, just read parts of it out loud and then went quiet.

The fact that a couple days after the police “found nothing” in the Yates house, it burned down in the middle of the night.

Electrical fire, they said on the local news. Old wiring. Whole place went up. No one inside. Case closed.

And the way my dad flinches now whenever anyone jokes about “just one empty chair.” He did it in Price Chopper last week when some lady in front of us said that, and he dropped a can of corn.

It’s the day before Thanksgiving again as I’m writing this.

My parents invited me to come home. They promised to “do things differently.” They said we could talk about Uncle Mark and the chair and everything. My mom texted me a photo of the table already set, every seat filled, like proof.

I told them I’m spending it with my aunt instead. Her table is small, but every seat will be filled. No one is left out. She even pulled up a random folding chair just so there’d be literally zero gaps. It looks stupid, but I didn’t say anything.

Even then, I keep looking at the door.

If your family has someone they’re “not ready to see,” that’s between you and them. I get it. Sometimes people are dangerous. Sometimes boundaries are necessary. My uncle really did throw a chair at me; that part isn’t made up.

But if you’ve got an empty chair this week, maybe think hard about why it’s empty.

And if you hear slow footsteps behind you on a cold November night, or knocks at your door after midnight that don’t sound urgent, just patient—

Maybe don’t answer.

Everyone eats.
Everyone gets a seat.

You just don’t want to find out what happens when someone like him decides you’re the one he’s saving a plate for.
