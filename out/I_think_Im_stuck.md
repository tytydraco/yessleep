I walk into my office just before 8:30.

“Morning, Lacey,” I wave to our receptionist.

“Good morning, Jack,” She smiles warmly.

I swipe my card at the reader.

“Hope you have a great day,” I say as goodbye.

A few of my breakroom buddies say hello as well.

Typical morning as I boot up my computer.

Our morning schedule is plastered on the whiteboard in the hall next to our boss’s office.

She likes to leave little notes of encouragement on our personal whiteboards.

Today, mine said, “I appreciate the way you communicate with your clients and coworkers. Your clients thank you for the work that you do.”

Lacey calls me up at 9:24, saying, “Good morning, Jack,” then hangs up.

I lean back into my chair, confused.

I shrug and check my email.

An email from myself timestamped at 10:27 pops up at 10:02, “Don’t go to the meeting.”

I see Cody in the breakroom. “Do we have a meeting today?”

“Yeah, it’s about that big new client we have coming up. Big boss lady wants us all there.”

I hear from behind. “Yes, Jack. Don’t miss it.”

“Oops. What was that about?”

“Dunno, man. Is she angry with you?”

“Didn’t think so. Her encouragement today was very nice.”

I shrug, bringing a cup of steaming coffee back to my desk in my little mosaic mug.

The email is gone.

I can’t find it anywhere.

It is not in the sent folder or in the junk folder.

Nowhere in the main folder either.

At 10:27, an email shows up in my draft box.

The same as before: “Don’t go to the meeting.”

I hit send.

At the same time, one from my boss: “Our meeting is at 11! No one miss it please. It’s very important.”

Lacey calls again at 10:49, “Good morning, Jack.”

The exact same greeting.

Followed by, “You told me this would happen today.”

She hangs up.

The call isn’t registered in my previous calls.

My whiteboard says, “Don’t miss the meeting, Jack.” in my boss’s handwriting.

The earlier encouragement is gone.

10:57 rolls by, and I think, “Should I go?”

10:59 hits, and I sit at my desk, not willing to go.

I sit at my desk, staring at my emails, drinking my coffee, not willing to go.

Ten minutes pass, and it’s still 10:59.

Lacey calls again, “Good morning, Jack. Thanks for reminding me of the meeting.”

“No problem...” I stammer.

I don’t remember reminding her.

I get up and trek towards the conference room.

The room is brightly lit, with all my coworkers and Sydney, our boss, sitting at the end.

They all smile in my direction as I walk in.

The clock behind her hits 11:00.

I take my seat, and everyone keeps staring at me, expectantly.

The clock drones on, and each minute slogs by.

My heart rate increases as I hyperventilate.

The clock finally hits 11:45.

Forty-five minutes of total silence.

“Thanks for coming to the meeting, everyone. Our new client will be happy with the changes we are going to make.”

I stumble out of the room, everyone still staring at me with that ridiculous smile.

An email shows up from 10:27: “I told you not to go.”

Lacey calls again, “Good morning, Jack. Now look what you’ve done.”

Sydney drops by. “Why didn’t you go to the meeting, Jack? I’m disappointed.”

“But I did go. You were all staring at me.”

I blink and whirl around at my desk.

Lacey calls again, “Good morning, Jack. Don’t miss the meeting.”

The time reads 10:47.

“Hello, Jack. Don’t miss our meeting today!” Sydney smiles, writing on my whiteboard: “Let’s do our best!”

An email from 10:27: “No going back now!”

I run around my office aimlessly, trying to find sanity.

“Hey, Jack! Our meeting is today!”

“What’s up, Jack! Meeting at 11:00 this morning!”

“Don’t forget to go to the meeting, Jack!”

I laugh nervously.

I walk past them over and over.

The same three people, saying the same thing.

Yet, I keep walking the same way.

Each revolution ends at my desk.

Sam, one of my coworkers in the loop, starts robotically waving at me.

His facial expression is gone, and his mouth unmoving. “Hey, Jack! Our meeting is today!”

I go forward, turning around back to Sam, and it’s the other coworker, Preston.

His clothing is in disarray, his voice haggard, “What’s up, Jack! Meeting at 11:00 this morning!”

I run in a random direction. The third person, Kelly, says the exact same thing; she’s bruised. “Don’t forget to go to the meeting, Jack!”

I sluggishly crawl forward and reach my desk.

An email from Lacey at 10:27, “Good morning, Jack. Don’t miss the meeting!”

My phone rings. It’s Sydney. “Good morning, Jack! Our meeting is in a couple of minutes. I just thought I’d remind you.”

I check my computer, my watch, and my phone.

All of them stuck like frozen insects in amber.

They read: 10:59.

I run my fingers through my hair, looking up at the ceiling.

“What do I do?”

An email from 10:28, “Don’t go to the meeting, Jack.”

A tear rolls down my face.

I get up and walk past the same three people, battered and bruised, missing limbs, and bleeding on the floor.

They still emit the same greeting, even while mangled and dying.

I frantically run past, and I arrive at the conference room instead of my desk.

“Good morning, Jack. Thanks for coming to our meeting.”

I stare at them, mouth hanging open, color draining from my face.

They’re covered in thick, slimy, blonde hair.

The tangled, greasy hair falls from the ceiling in clumps.

It’s centralized from our boss, Sydney.

It moves on its own and climbs into everyone through whatever orifice it can find.

They smile as the slick hair invades their mouths, ears, eyes, and wounds.

“We’re proud of you, Jack.” Sydney says without blinking, “Thank you for coming to the meeting.”

My stunned body doesn’t allow me to move.

I flounder and hit the ground, trying to escape.

The hair grabs me, but I rip it away.

A small strand lingers on my leg, and I scratch at it, attempting to get it off me.

It moves on its own, up my thigh.

I instinctively cover my privates.

It darts into my pants.

I scream.

It forces itself inside my urethra, slow at first—then too fast.

Burning, twisting, like it knows where to go.

Every movement is intense and extremely sensitive.

I dry heave and writhe on the floor.

I hold myself, trembling, until I hear the email chime.

An email from 10:28 reads: “Good morning, Jack. This will go on until 5:00.”

I don’t know how much longer I can take this. It's not even 11 yet.
