He was sitting right there, The man in a white Suit and a fedora. It was my 3rd time seeing him and as soon as I saw him, Immediately I started looking around. What I am going to say next will probably sound insane But,  I think That man is death. Now I know what you are thinking, " Whats so Deathly about a man in a white suit?" But hear me out.

The first time I saw him was 3 months ago,  I was at the bus stop and Just looking around trying to kill sometime till the bus arrived. Thats when I first saw him, a man standing in the distance. He was wearing a white suite, white tie and a fedora. I couldn't look at the face as his head was tilted down looking at the watch on his wrist and his Fedora covered his face. I didn't think much of it cuz why would I? Its just some guy on the street. 

As I am looking around waiting for the bus to arrive, suddenly I hear loud noises. They sounded loud screams. I turned to where the sound was coming from and what I saw shocked me to my core. People were running violently away from the streets as abus was speeding down the road ramming  into everything in its path. From where I stood I could see the driver frantically turning the steering wheel, trying to avoid hitting anyone he could as the bus was swirling all over the place. A little girl fell on the road as she was trying to run away  Inches away from her, the bus driver Saw the little girl and turn the steering wheel completely to right in the hopes   of not hitting her but, as he did that the bus flipped to one side and everyone saw in horror as a 12 ton Vehicle fell on this little girl, crushing her.  

Cops and paramedics swarmed the place as they started looking for survivor. To everyones surprise, everyone on the bus was completely fine, badly injured but alive. The only casualty reported was the little girl. As the dust from the accident setteled, I saw that man again. He put both of his hands in pocket and walked away.

The second time I saw was at my friends wedding. He was dressed the same, A white suite, white tie and a fedora.Just like last time he was Looking at his watch. When I saw him I remembered him from the day of the accident. I walked to my friend who was busy with all the guests and asked him

" Hey man, Who is that guy?" I said looking in his direction. 

" Who?" My friend asked me, quite confused.

" That guy in the fedora, how can you not see him he is the only one here with a hat" 

My friend looked around the room searching for the guy and then looked at me and said "Look man if you are trying to mess with me, now is not the right time. I already have my hands full here dealing with everyone." He said he started going towards someone calling his name. 

" How could he not see him?" I was standing there thinking. As I was standing there thinking about all this, I suddenly heard a loud thud. I looked around and saw everyone gathered around someone. 

" Whats happening?" I asked someone in the crowd.

" Its the grooms father, He suddenly collapsed." 

So many people were gathered around him, I couldn't see what was going on. Suddenly I heard someone shouting " Shit he is not breathing. someone call an ambulance." 

Suddenly everyone took out their phones and started calling for help. As I looked around I saw him again. The man with Fedora. Just like last time, he put both his hands in his pocket and walked away. Soon the paramedics arrived and Took the Grooms father to the hospital but according to the doctor it was too late, he had already passed away. 

One time could be a coincidence, maybe two. After that incident, I always thought about that man every once in a while. Was him being present at these events really a coincidence? That brings us to Today. I got off work late today and so I missed the Bus I would usually take. It would have been a while till the next one showed up and I didn't really felt like waiting So,  I decided to ride the subway instead. I stepped into the train and luckily found a spot to sit. As I sat down I looked at the person sitting opposite to me , a chill went down my spine. It was the Man with the fedora sitting there, looking at his watch.

I froze, I didn't know what to do. I had only seconds to react before the doors would shut and so I got up and bolted out of that train. As soon as I got out, the doors cloded behind me and the train went its way. I decided to walk home. I didn't close by at all but I decided a long way home was worth way more than a ride with that man. He just gave me the creeps. 

On my way home I kept checking my phone about any news that dealt with a subway accident or a passenger dying in a train. From my experience, if that man was In there, something is bound to happen.  As I kept scrolling and scrolling on my phone, I saw nothing. I started thinking that maybe I was just overreacting and Maybe it was all a coincidence. It took me an hour and a half to reach home and I was exhausted. I changed my clothes and sat on clothes and again started looking at some news and Nothing. There were no news about any subway accidents or anything. 

I let out a sigh of relief now knowing that It was a coincidence and I was overthinking it. Now feeling relieved, I decided to go out to my balcony and just relax there. As I stood outside just looking at the night sky, I felt like something was off. I looked down on the street and My eyes opened wide and my face went pale, The man is standing right in front of my apartment building, Looking down at his watch.

As I am typing this now, a very horrifying thought has crossed my mind. Maybe there was no accident because no one was suppose to die on the train. Maybe the person who was suppose to die wasnt present on the train.


 Maybe its me.
