Alright everyone, today i have a true story for you, happened last year.

  
Even today i'm a 17 year old spoiled brat, but i've been one for a while now. Last year even more. Ever since i started my teenage years i've been smoking, drinking and flirting with drugs (you dont need to tell me how fucked up it is, i know myself), but when i went at a party or whatever i didn't really go out of my town, at least until last year. I started taking mid-distance trains to get to my friend's cities and met a lot of people, mostly alternative people. I was always bouncing from one group of people to another and eventually i started hanging out with this dudes who liked going to the mountains. I enjoyed going hitchhiking with them because it wasn't something i had done a lot before, and eventually became an amateur myself. Over the weeks we really got along and we started going hiking at least once a week. We always went to the same spot, a clear in the middle of a little forest in which we could settle up a campfire and sometimes a tent. This one weekend was one of those special ones when we'd camp and stay the weekend. Exams were over, summer started, we had a lot of alcohol, a lot of weed and some girls came too, so we were pretty hyped. The first night was pretty chill. We had the music and the private camping little party going and i even got lucky with one of the girls. At some point of the night, i was high as hell and i got into the woods to take a piss. Whenever i'm walking alone, in the streets, in high school or in the woods, i tend to whistle. Most of the times songs from the beatles and such that are burned into my memory. I was walking through the trees, whistling "do you want to know a secret" and started pissing on a random pine while still whistling the melody, until i heard something:

  
"shhhh"

  
I stopped immediately, even with the peeing. I looked around, trying to search where did it come from, but it wasn't far away. At the moment i wasnt really scared, mostly because i was under the influence and didnt really pay to much attention or just didn't care. At that moment, the only thing in my brain was to pee and go back to the tent where a hot alternative chick would be waiting for me, so i finished my bussiness and got back to camp.

I was the first one to wake up next morning. I got up to the pleasant smell of humanity and people who didn't shower in two days. I didn't have a hangover or anything and i was feeling pretty activated, so i got out for a morning walk. I had walked through those trees multiple times before. I knew the trail and even the animals that could be around. I should have walked down calmly like i used to, but that day i was feeling uncanny. I started walking slower at each step because this horrible feeling that i was being watched was growing. At that point, i was paranoid. I looked around trying to see and analyze every detail. I could only see bushes, trees, rocks and a person. a person? 

Like 50 meters away, i could hardly distinguish the dark silhouete of a head peeking at me from behind a tree. The moment i noticed it i froze. Whoever was there must have realized i saw them because they instantly hid behind the tree. I just stood there like a statue wondering what was that and trying to reason it, maybe it was a squirrel climbing the tree or something, but even tho i couldn't see the face, or the hair or anything other than a shadow, i was sure it was a person. Without taking my eyes from that one tree, i started slowly walking back into camp. When i got there, some of the guys were already up. We had a good vibe and i didn't really want to kill it and scare everyone, so i took one of my friends and secretly told him what i had seen. I told him i thought we were being stalked, and he just answered me that it could have been any other hitchhiker and that even if we were being stalked, we were like 10 guys. I acted as if that calmed me down and the rest of the day, i just tried not to think about it and to have fun. After all, that was the purpose of the trip.

Just in case, that night i made sure to stay sober. Everyone was dancing, smoking, having sex or telling stories and i was just standing there keeping an eye on the woods. The girl i had been with the night before came to me and started talking to me. Looking into her eyes i realized i was being paranoid and that i should just forget about it and have fun. We started kissing and hugging each other and she eventually told me to go to the tent with her. I was dying to sleep with her but i also had to pee, so i told her to go and that i would be there later. I looked at the woods, took my pocket knife and started walking towards them. I was determined that if i found anyone stalking, i'd just yell at them and tell them to go, and if they didn't, someone would have to get stabbed. I was about to finish my task on a tree, this time without whistling, when i heard it again.

  
"shhhh"

  
My blood ran cold. It was much closer than the last time. I looked up, until where the lights of our camp could let a clear view, and i saw a naked man sprinting at me. I didn't even try to stay around and see his face. All of my determination and masculinity dropped below zero at that instant. I ran faster than i have ever ran. Usain Bolt would have been no one. Adrenaline really does miracles. I kept running and gasping for air, i couldn't even scream and i was in the verge of crying. I could hear that maniac get closer and closer, until i finally got to camp, and he stopped in his tracks. I told everyone what happened, and all the boys got their pocket knifes and went out there to find him. I stayed at the tent, maybe i was a coward or a babygirl or whatever but i swore to every god i wasn't gonna get out of there until the sun came out. 

The next day, we all packed our things and left quietly. Everyone was shook from last night. I kept asking my friends if they saw something but they didn't answer and just changed the topic. We never got back there and sadly i got away from that kind of activities. I'm thankful i wasn't killed or raped that night and to this day, i still don't know who he was, and what did he want.
