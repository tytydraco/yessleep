The old analog TV sat untouched in the corner of my great grandmas musty basement, a relic of a bygone era. Its wood paneled frame gleamed faintly in the dim light of a single, swaying bulb. The air was damp, heavy with the smell of mildew, and a faint chill seemed to seep from the cracked concrete walls. I didn’t intend to turn it on. It was likely broken, after all, but curiosity got the better of me.

The screen flickered to life with a low hum, static hissing and popping. I fiddled with the dial, expecting nothing but white noise. Instead, a grainy newscast emerged from the ether. The date at the corner of the screen stopped me cold. *January 25, 2030*.
The anchor's voice was hollow, robotic, as if drained of emotion through years of repeating horrors. Behind her, a picture of a man I instantly recognized. His sharp features and smug expression dominated the screen, his name scrolling beneath. **Caldwin Stark, Global Unifier and CEO of Unity Motors.** I couldn’t tear my eyes away as the broadcast unfolded. Stark’s voice, clipped and commanding, echoed through the room in a grainy recording. He was at a podium, addressing a sea of soldiers clad in stark black uniforms. Red banners behind him, bearing a symbol eerily similar to those from history’s darkest chapters. Stark's words were chilling, delivered with the charisma of a man who had long ago learned to wield power with ruthless efficiency.
"Unity through order. Strength through purity. *The future of humanity begins with us!*"

The report cut to shaky, covert footage from across America. Streets patrolled by drones, their cameras scanning crowds of emaciated, hollow eyed people. ICE agents clad in riot gear pulled screaming families from their homes, loading them into unmarked vehicles. Protestors were beaten in broad daylight, their signs of dissatisfaction trampled underfoot.
The anchor’s monotone voice narrated over the chaos. "In adherence to the Unity Reclamation Act, the government has accelerated deportations of all undocumented individuals. Gender identification audits continue in schools, workplaces, and homes. Citizens found violating the Male-Female Identity Mandate are subject to reeducation camps."
The screen cut to a clinic. Or rather, a former clinic. The camera panned across the boarded up doors of what used to be a Planned Parenthood, now converted into a "National Center for Family Values." A reporter stood outside, reading aloud the latest decree. "Abortions are punishable by life imprisonment, with an exception for medical emergencies if and only if *two* state approved doctors sign off."
My stomach churned. Stark’s voice returned, his calm, chilling tone overlaying images of crying children being torn from their parents. "The sanctity of the family is non-negotiable. Our future depends on eradicating impurity, both within and among us."

I shivered. The room felt colder, as if the TV’s glow was sucking all warmth from the air. Every shadow seemed alive, creeping toward me as the anchor continued. "As of today, all citizens are required to register their DNA profiles for surveillance purposes. Noncompliance will result in immediate detainment."
The final segment showed an elderly veteran stooped in front of a gutted, graffiti covered church. He wore a faded jacket decorated with medals underneath the tattered blanket he held around his shoulders, his eyes brimming with despair. His voice cracked as he spoke, his words burned into my mind. "This is the Third Reich reborn. I lived it before, and now I’m dying in its shadow again. Only this time, it’s everywhere, and no one is fighting back." The air felt suffocating, the oppressive cold wrapping around my chest. The images on the screen blurred as my vision swam, but Stark’s voice cut through like a knife: "Unity above all. **HEIL STARK**." Without thinking, without even realizing it, my hand grabbed at my chest, touching my heart as if pledging allegiance. Then, as if possessed by something far beyond my control, it shot upward in the air, rigid and trembling. A wave of horror crashed over me, my mind screaming for my body to stop, but I was frozen. Ensnared by the words, the images, the pull of something dark and ancient that clawed at the edges of my soul. The realization hit like a slap. It wasn’t just the future on the screen. It was infecting me.

With a choked cry, I wrenched my arm back down and lunged for the dial. My fingers fumbled, trembling so violently I could barely grip it, but I managed to twist it hard enough to make the screen go black. The sudden silence was deafening, the hum of the TV gone, replaced by the rapid pounding of my heart. The room was still cold, but now it felt malevolent. The shadows seemed closer, pressing in like silent witnesses to a moment of weakness. My hand shivered as I stared at it, flexing the fingers as though trying to convince myself it still belonged to me. The chill in the room was no longer physical. It came from within, the weight of what I’d just witnessed pressing down on my chest. Outside, life went on as if none of this was hurtling toward us, but I knew better. I backed away from the TV, leaving it dead and silent in the corner. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that it had *seen* me. Had somehow reached into my mind and pulled out something primal, something desperate. And I knew, in the pit of my stomach, that it wasn’t just a relic showing me the future.

Finally, I stood and left the basement, leaving that ancient thing in the dark. But the fear and hopelessness followed, clawing at the edges of my mind while whispering that no matter how far I ran, the future was already here.
