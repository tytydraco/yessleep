Dear Logan,  
I wrote you, but you still ain’t callin’…just kidding. It’s been a while. I can’t believe that it’s been six years since college. How is it being a nurse? I bet the hours are shit lol. Also, I saw that you got engaged!!!! OMG! I would have never seen that coming! You truly are a lucky woman, but not half as lucky as he is! When is the wedding? I hope to receive an invitation! I can’t wait to see you walking down the aisle! Just thinking about how beautiful you are makes me so excited to be there. You’re so lucky! Maybe one day I can find somebody too. Maybe he’ll be tall like Patrick is. Maybe he’ll have the same physique. I wonder if he will be as kind? Anyways, enough about that. I’m sure you’ve already had these thoughts running through your head, so I don’t want to overload you lol. Please reach back out soon!!! I can’t wait to hear from you! It’s been too long!  
Much Love,  
Big Hugs,  
Big Kisses,

Hey,  
Sorry, I forgot to mention in my last letter that I am actually going back to school for my Masters degree! Can you believe it?! Me! I’ve come a long way since being the awkward one in the dorms, crying, and wishing that I wasn’t there lol. I’m super nervous about grad school! I’m working on getting my student loans straightened out. Hopefully in the next two years or so I’ll be able to put this degree to good use. Life is kind of rough right now. There isn’t a whole lot that I can do with an English degree. I could really use some encouragement. You were always a role model to me. You’re so special. I could really go for some of your epic words of wisdom! Something to get me out of this funk! I strive to be like you so much its ridiculous lol. Please write back soon.  
Best regards,  
Big hug,  
Big kiss,

Hey!!!  
I was walking to the mailbox outside of my apartment building. I saw a guy busting his ass on his skateboard. Remember when Trevor used to skate around the quad to try and impress those cute skater chicks? He was horrible, but I’m glad his determination paid off lol. I saw that he’s actually marrying Maggie! Considering they broke up like three times, I’m hoping that this one sticks lol. He’s a goofball, but a good guy at heart. I haven’t seen him in years either. I’m glad he ditched the blonde hair. Didn’t suit him. I like his natural dark color better. Maggie is still rocking the platinum blonde though. She’s a hell of a lot closer to thirty than she is to twenty, so I was expecting that to be a thing of the past. I guess if you have a set of giant tits like she does you could do whatever you want though lol. I remember how you always used to make jokes about wondering how she managed to stay on her skateboard with those things dragging her down lol. Still one of my funniest memories of all of us together. Grrrrrrr. So long ago! I miss the crew! I miss being together! God! Those long talks, all that angst, the stresses of college life! But we still had a blast!  
Anyways, I still saw that you didn’t write back! I’m sure work and the upcoming wedding have you mad busy! No biggie! But I would like to hear from you soon! I need reassurance that you’re okay!! Lol.  
P.S. Duh, I know you’re okay. You’re Logan!  
Best regards,  
Much Love,  
Big hugs,  
Big kisses,

Logan,  
Hey, I’m sorry. I’ve been worrying about you. You’re not writing me back. I’m sorry I lost your phone number, so I can’t call you to check up on you. I know, I know, you’ve probably changed it since we were in school together. Your email address also isn’t the same. When I don’t hear from you though, I worry. You were always a very headstrong an independent woman. That’s gotten you in a few sticky situations in the past. Like remember that time Sophomore year? Spring break in Mexico? I watched you go shot for shot with those two girls at the bar. After that, when that one girl’s boyfriend jumped in, you took him to school too! But they weren’t happy about it. I remember you taking both of those girls down, even when you were overtaken by tequila. Its still one of my favorite Logan moments. But then everybody had to high tail it to the hotel because you had gotten the bar shut down because of that. The patrons weren’t happy. They had to find somewhere else to drink that night.  
Listen, I’m almost scared to ask this. But…how is Patrick treating you? I’m sorry if this is out of line, but I’m concerned. I’ve never met him before. I don’t know if this has anything to do with him. I don’t know if this is him trying to keep you close to him. I don’t want to jump to conclusions or anything. He seems like a nice guy according to your Facebook profile, but the fact that you haven’t answered any of my letters, and now that I see you Facebook messenger is turned off, I’m worried about you. I really hope you get this and get back to me soon.  
Best regards,  
Big hug,  
Sam.

Logan,  
I saw a picture that was posted on Amanda’s Facebook page. It was a picture of you two on “girls’ night” a few days ago. What the hell? Are we not friends anymore? Can you not be bothered to so much as pick up a pen for me? You can’t send me a simple email? Also, I know that Amanda just finished law school in California. Quite a drive away from Texas, don’t you think? You can make plans to see her, but you can’t even message me back? I’m hoping that my letters got lost in the mail or something. I really hope that this isn’t something I’ve done to offend you, and now you’re shutting me out. If that’s true, trust me, whatever I did, I’m sorry. You are seriously the coolest girl I’ve ever met. I value you too much as a person to ever lose you. Please get back to me as soon as you can.  
Please,  
Sam.

Logan,  
Okay, seriously, this is getting out of hand! I saw a picture that Maggie posted on her Insta. Seriously? She’s your maid of honor? Like, Maggie-Maggie? After all we’ve been through, you choose her? The girl that made a pass at you during our freshman year. Yeah, didn’t think I remembered your little lesbian experimentation? The “please don’t tell anybody about this” shit you told her while she had her face in your panties? I remember walking into the dorm that night and seeing you two panting like dogs on the floor. I wonder if Patrick and Trevor know? Or, maybe that’s all of your thing? Hmm? Something else you’re not including me in? You think any of them can love you the way that I can? I don’t think so. But, I’m not going to fight you on this. Its you’re wedding. You can do whatever you want, but am I actually not even worth an invitation?  
Fuck this,  
Sam.

Logan,  
What the hell is happening? You need to tell me. I’m crying my eyes out right now. I’m half a bottle deep in tequila. I’m scrolling through old pictures of you and trying to figure out where I went wrong. I’m so sorry if I hurt you. I’m also sorry about what I said in my last letter. I’m disgusted. I wish I could take it back. Please know, your secrets will always be safe with me. I don’t want you to think that I’d ever betray your confidence. I’m sure Maggie is the better choice. You need someone that will actually treat you right. She was always a ball buster. I’m sure she’ll bust a few heads for you. Please respond to me. I’m scared. I’m worried. I’m sad.  
Love you,  
Sam.

Logan,  
I’m sorry about the drunk letter I wrote you. I really was just feeling down on myself. I’m doing much better now. I have to quit drinking. I really made a mess of my apartment while doing that, so I’m spending the day cleaning that up. I had to spend all day yesterday detoxing lol. Oh! I forgot to tell you! I actually came across that bikini top you wore that time we all went to the beach! You know, the one that was too small and you spent most of the day trying to keep yourself from escaping? Oh my God! That is still funny to me to this day! It must have gotten lost in the laundry. You remember how the laundry room in the dorms were lol. Always finding things that didn’t belong to you. Anyways. I’ll have to get going. I have a long trip ahead of me. Work sucks, lol, but it needs to get done, right? I’ll be on the move for a few days, so I’ll spare you having to get letters from me lol. I hope you and Patrick are doing well. I can’t wait to meet him some day! Oh! You two are going to love the wedding present that I’m getting for you!  
Much Love,   
Sam.

Hey Logan,  
Guess where I am?! If you guessed anywhere except “Maggie’s House”, then you guessed wrong. I’m sitting in the closet writing this out. Sorry about my handwriting, its dark in here. I can hear her moaning. Guess they’re having fun lol. What do you think would happen if I walked out right now? Do you think they would notice? Do you think they could be bothered to stop fucking for two seconds to realize that they were in danger? In the position that she’s in, she probably wouldn’t notice. What if I just announced my presence? SURPRISE YOU STUPID BITCHES! You think Travis would go for his gun? The .44 magnum that he keeps in the nightstand on his side of the bed? One shot from that thing and I’d be blown off of this Earth lol. Oooops. What do we have here? Oh no, looks like the bullets are in my pocket. I guess that gun won’t do him any good. I wonder if either of them could dodge a filet knife in time? Her back is to me, and he’s under her. I could probably get both of them before they even knew what was going on. Why waste my time with a quick one? I want to see the look in her eyes when she sees him bleeding out like STUCK FUCKING SWINE! You think she’ll cry? You think she’ll beg? You think that shallow ass big titty slut would even remember who the fuck I am?! Apparently, I’m fucking forgettable! Apparently its really fucking easy to put me on THE MOTHER FUCKING BACKBURNER!  
Don’t worry though Logan. She can’t corrupt you anymore. I won’t let her. As soon as I take care of this little problem of ours, you and I can be friends again. We can be happy! We can have girls’ night! We can grab dinner whenever we want! And I can actually be your maid of honor! Oh my God, I’m so happy! I’m so sorry that she put you in this position. She is so fucking selfish.  
Ahhhhhhhhh. Looks like little Ms. Big Tits finally climaxed. Don’t worry Logan. I’ll finish her off. I’ll take out Travis in front of her, just so she knows what its like to have somebody that she loves pulled from her life. I’ll make her suffer for everything she’s made you do, just to fucking get rid of me. I’ll make her squeal. I’ll put the slut on all fours and treat her like the true bitch that she is. I’ll mail this out from her P.O. box when I’m done. I may just send a locket of that fake ass hair along with it, just to show you how serious I am about wanting to be a part of your life, and what I’ll do for you. I’m a better fit for you than she is in sooo many ways. I tested the blade of my knife on my finger tip. Nice and sharp. Enjoy the informal red signature over the letter lol. The next time I write you, Maggie will officially be out of our lives for good.  
Much Love,  
Sam.

Logan,  
I don’t know what to do. I’m crying right now. My vision is fading. I’m getting lightheaded. I think I may be dying. It is everything in me to write this letter out. Shit, this didn’t go the way I planned. I thought he would die. I played it in my head a million times. I stabbed him three times. He still kept screaming and moving. I hit him in the stomach, but it didn’t kill him. I hit him in his thigh, but he didn’t bleed out. He was supposed to bleed out. I HAVE THE PICTURE OF THE DAMN DIAGRAM ON MY PHONE! THERE IS A MAJOR ARTERY IN THE LEG, HE SHOULD HAVE BLED OUT! I aimed for his chest, but he moved and I hit his shoulder. I would have gotten him if Maggie didn’t grab my wrist. She hit me really hard Logan. My head hurts real bad. She twisted my wrist and stuck the knife in my tummy. She didn’t stop hitting me. I screamed as loud as I could hoping somebody would hear me. She made me into a fucking victim. She’s horrible, she ruins everything, I hate her, I hate her, I HATE HER! I fell down the stairs, otherwise she would have probably killed me. I hit my head. My elbow is throbbing. One of my back teeth fell out. I don’t deserve this.  
Why did it all have to come to this? Why couldn’t you just let me be a part of your life? Why did you make me go this way? And now its too late. Now the next time you’ll hear about me, it’ll be on the news about the dead girl they found near the public mailbox. Everybody is going to hate you for the way that you treated me. Everybody is going to hate themselves for the way that they treated me. They are especially going to hate YOU though! You could have prevented this. You could have stopped this. YOU LET THAT FUCKING BITCH STICK A KNIFE IN ME! Fuck, Logan. Did you miss my back?! YOU WILL FOREVER BE HATED FOR THIS!!!!!  
Not by me though. I can feel it. These are my last breaths. Its coming Logan. I’m sorry. I failed you as a friend. You deserve better than me.  
Goodbye,  
Sam.  
I can’t even wrap my head around this. Who the fuck is Sam? How the fuck does she know so much about me? How does she know about my friends? Where the fuck was she? I get a phone call from Maggie right after receiving the last letter, saying that Travis was attacked in their house. He’s fine. He lost a lot of blood, and had to undergo emergency surgery, but he’ll pull through. He’s set to be released in a few says. Their ring doorbell footage got an image of the girl, but for the life of me, I can’t remember who she is. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever seen her before. Maggie is clueless as to who she is. Police assumed that this was a random attack, but given the letters that I received, I highly doubt that.  
I’m turning these letters in. Patrick brought me down to the police station. Hopefully this shines some light on what happened. I think I’m going to delete my social’s, at least for a while. I don’t want to think that something like this can happen again. I didn’t hear anything about a girl being found dead near a mailbox, or anywhere else in the area for that matter. I’m mortified, and scared to death. I don’t know what to do, and honestly, don’t know if there is anything I could do. She could still be out there. She could be watching me, waiting, and inserting herself into my life, when she has never been a part of it. This chills my blood.
