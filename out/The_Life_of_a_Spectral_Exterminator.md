Greetings, all. My name is Romulus. My former trainee and longtime friend, Solomon Eisenhart, recently disappeared, and I have a feeling he won't be returning. He told me he'd been working on this post based on his journal entries for all of you to leave an account of some of his experiences with the great evils this world has to offer. He wanted you to know that there are people on Earth who believe your stories and that we are out there fighting to protect you. Solomon had a decorated career in the Corps, and he will be sorely missed. Tonight, I raise a glass to you, old friend.

**First Contact**

Before the dark times in my life, I enjoyed hiking around the many national parks the United States have to offer. I watched my fiance be butchered in front of me by some ethereal being we were clearly never meant to stumble upon while on a trip to a scenic vista in northwestern Montana. I remember it as if it were yesterday, even though it's been nearly 15 years.

We rounded the trail's corner in some dense forest and came upon a crystal-clear lake. The pictures truly don't do the views justice. We could see the innumerable trout swimming freely beneath the surface; it was almost as if they were dancing with the gentle current. My fiance walked over to a floating log that had a few painted turtles basking in the sun.

I became so transfixed on the scene below that I failed to notice the dark figure approaching from the other side of the lake until it caused the fish to scatter. At first, I thought it was a monster bull trout on the prowl for its next meal, but what I saw rise out of the lake left me paralyzed with fear. I was faced with a tall figure so dark it was as if it absorbed any light that touched it, obscuring any discernable features other than its glowing, violet eyes. I could physically feel the malice exuding from those piercing eyes.

My fiance screamed at me to get away from the writhing dark mass as I fell over in terror. The ethereal being's eyes turned to face her, causing my protective instinct to override my fear. I unholstered a revolver I brought for protection from any bears or so called "hill people" and unloaded two of the .454 Casull rounds as I ran to protect my soon-to-be wife.

The first shot missed wide into the water, but the second scored a direct hit on what should have been the entity's chest. Thinking I could have at least wounded it enough to slow it down, I grabbed her hand and began sprinting down the trail. As we rounded the first corner, we were once again confronted with the dark horror. I fired my remaining four rounds into it only to find that they ricocheted in different directions. A hand produced itself as the being's mass undulated in an unnatural way and grabbed me by my neck, flinging me into a nearby tree; a sharp pain coursed through my body as I felt several ribs crack on impact.

Fueled by adrenaline, I picked myself up to attempt a run at whatever this thing was to give my fiance a chance to escape. To my dread, the ghostly figure floated closer toward her with its hand now outstretched. As I rushed toward the scene, a scythe-like protrusion suddenly erupted from the shadowy forearm and went straight through her chest; she never even had a chance to scream. I stopped in my tracks due to the shock of what I'd just witnessed. Tears flowed down her face as she reached out for me, while a second hand produced itself from the being's ghostly form and pulled my beloved into the abyss, never to be seen again. I chased the phantom to the lake's edge where it finally turned to face me, now with a faint, red glow emanating from its mass.

I demanded the spirit bring her back, even though I knew it was all but impossible.

A received a chilling response that still haunts me in my waking hours and my nightmares, "Only when you learn my true name, shall you be reunited in the void beyond."

**The Organization**

Following this encounter, I began my search for anything resembling this entity. The results were nonexistent even after exhausting all methods traditional and not. That was until I came across a man who called himself Romulus. He claimed he was an expert in these matters and had information that could help me track down my newfound quarry. With no options left, I agreed to meet him at a local bar in my hometown back in Arkansas.

To say Romulus was a behemoth of a man would be a vast understatement. He towered over me at nearly 7 feet tall and was a solid mass of muscle likely pushing 300 pounds. His overall appearance had me thinking of a Viking that had somehow been transported to modern times, but there was something almost artificial about him, as if he was made in a lab.

"Let's just get straight to the point. For lack of a better term, I'll call whatever that *thing* was a phantom. What do you know about it?" I asked.

"That depends, Solomon," Romulus responded in a low, gruff voice that nearly shook the beer in my hand. "Are you willing to leave behind everything you know in pursuit of it?"

"What the hell is that supposed to mean? I can't just up and leave my life behind. I still have responsibilities to-"

"I work for an organization that tracks down all manner of anomalies like the one you encountered that day. Officially, we don't exist. Unofficially, we are a shadow branch of the national guard specially trained to fight these anomalies until they have been rendered *silent*," Romulus countered, cutting me off. The emphasis he put on the word silent was off-putting to me. Was he implying that this organization of his had ways to kill these types of beings? That was my next question.

"Yes. Even as we speak, we have operatives known as spectral exterminators on deployment hunting them down. We deal with problems that can be classified as extraterrestrial, extraordinary, and extrasensory. As it so happens, we're looking for new recruits, and you have every reason to join the fight. The pay is substantial, but you will have to relocate to \[REDACTED\] for training," Romulus continued, subtly hinting that I would be going with him whether I wanted to or not. Having no other options, I agreed to join the Spectral Extermination Corps. I was declared dead by suicide the next day in a paper released

My first few months after relocation were far worse than any horror stories I've heard about traditional boot camps or special forces training. I had all available knowledge of things ranging from cryptids to aliens to apparitions drilled into my head in what recruits called the classroom. When I wasn't in the classroom, I was busy pushing my body to its limits or until I physically broke from the stress. That was nothing compared to the augmentations they made me undergo. Those bastards pumped me full of every drug, every steroid, and even some experimental supernatural enhancements. I nearly lost my ability to walk, ending up in a wheelchair for a month.

After being burned down to nothing, I rose again into nothing but a weapon. I still had a name, but I felt like I lost all sense of individuality by joining the Spectral Extermination Corps. My name was all that remained of my former life, and it often made me feel lonely. All I had left of my life was being a weapon for the Corps to protect all of you from suffering the same fate as my beloved Katherine.

Following my augmentations, I was given a set of what looked like 15th-century Medieval knight's armor that had extra gaps to allow for greater mobility. It was embedded with several enchantments to ward off apparitions that would be attracted to the negative emotions that become a mainstay since my initial encounter. Small amounts of several different metals were mixed with iron in the alloy used to craft my armor, but strangely no silver was used as one would expect due to many of the monsters we face having built up tolerances and in some cases immunities to the substance thanks to rapid evolution. Platinum and cobalt were used, as both had properties that made it difficult for the majority of cryptids to touch me.

Platinum is essentially silver on steroids, burning any cryptid that comes into contact with it, even in trace amounts. Cobalt acts as an excellent conductor for some of the supernatural enhancements I was given. As a result of those, I was able to acquire night vision for lack of a better term and pump out moderate electric currents to stun anything that I would be hunting.

As for what I learned of the assailant at the lake, it was an apparition that the Corps had been trying to track down for a long time, likely since the Corps' inception. They were unable to clue me in as to what its parting words meant other than it would likely come for me once I knew its true identity. The only other information Romulus was able to give to me was that it seemingly attacks at random, is Germanic in origin, and has only appeared in water. It is highly likely that it is singular in nature and is classified as an extradimensional threat, the only one we have catalogued thus far.

**Beware the Sonoran Desert**

After 15 years of working as a Spectral Exterminator, I think that my worst experience since first contact was by far my expedition to the Sonoran Desert. It began with a string of disappearances that occurred over a stretch of about two months; of course, there are always people who get lost in areas like these without any help from our supernatural friends. However, there was a pattern to these disappearances. That caught the attention of command, and I was sent in to investigate.

Initial intel had us believing that it was a Skinwalker that had been hunting hikers and campers. Given my level of experience at this point in my career, this would be a relatively short trip, although I would still need to watch my back, as these creatures are notoriously crafty. I traveled without my armor on this go around, as my agility would be my greatest asset against this foe. Sometimes finesse beats brute force, and that was certainly the case this time around. I left my Jeep at the trailhead and set off with my light hunting gear consisting of a machete, revolver, wolfsbane darts, and survival pack.

I came upon the campsite located just outside the walls of a vast canyon. I found a few human ribs scattered around the campsite, some of which had been cracked open, likely by some of the smaller supernatural game in the area to get at the marrow. Three once proud tents were in tatters, with only a few small strips of fabric clinging to the contorted frames. Fluff from sleeping bags were caught on some of the surrounding cacti.

The tell-tale signs of a Skinwalker attack were there judging by the amount of dried blood I found at the first campsite. Females in particular have a nasty habit of bleeding their victims dry while still alive before consuming them, as if they relish in the pain or perhaps, we simply taste better to them that way, as fish do to us. I cursed under my breath as I gazed deeply into the foreboding maw of the canyon before me. Depending on its form, my adversary would have the advantage by clinging to the walls of the canyon. I readied my dart gun and made quietly plunged my way into the canyon. Hopefully, I would find my quarry before nightfall.

I discovered a few clumps of cougar hair that appeared to have come off in patches strewn about on the canyon floor. Bingo. I was definitely hot on the trail of it now. For those of you who don't know, Skinwalkers tend to shed their hair in bunches when returning to human form. It's their body's way of dealing with such a rapid change.

I continued to find larger and larger clumps of hair as I traversed the canyon. Claw marks started to show themselves on the walls. Had this thing been sharpening its claws? Possibly. I moved for a closer inspection, and something didn't add up. It almost looked like the Skinwalker had been clinging to the wall and been dragged backward. What I thought were only scrapes were more akin to gouges. What lived out here that could drag an apex predator like this in such a way? I didn't want to find out alone.

I quickly radioed command to alert them of my peculiar findings only to be met with static. Shit. Command wouldn't be keeping me company on this trip. My next thought was that I needed to get out of the canyon and get somewhere to contact command and call in back up. If something can ragdoll a Skinwalker, it's at least a two-man job.

After traversing about another six miles, I come up in elevation into a large valley where the original trail should loop around to where my Jeep was parked. Unfortunately, no other signs of activity were found. This left me feeling uneasy. Slightly to my north was the beginning of a small mountain range. I began observing my surroundings and had no recognition of where I ended up. The saguaro cacti dotted the landscape, looming over me as if watching my every move. The sun was still relatively high. By my estimate it was around 3 pm. This bade well for a trek back to my Jeep to regroup.

Looking to the west, I saw a dust storm rolling in. My hike back to the Jeep would have to wait for now. I sprinted towards the nearest rock outcropping to wait out the coming haboob. As the storm hit, I reached into my pack and put on a pair of goggles to protect my eyes from the sand and small rocks picked up by the wind. I took a swig of water from my canteen and now, having time to think, I realized that the haboob was something of an anomaly. Although, not unheard of, these weather phenomena were uncommon in the month of October. There also hadn't been any sign of a thunderstorm in the area the entire day. Was this a freak occurrence, or was this something else? I'd heard of desert spirits before, but nothing that could conjure such a massive event.

It was nearing sundown by the time the haboob subsided. My focus was no longer on my Skinwalker quarry but getting back to the Jeep safely before nightfall. I didn't want to be out here with whatever had seemingly taken the predator by myself. Call me a coward, but even with everything I lost going through the grueling training to get here, I still had a sense of self-preservation.

Judging by my position, I was about 10 miles from the trailhead. If I kept a steady pace, I could make it back within an hour. However, I wanted to go slow enough to pick up any other details on my way to radio for backup. My surroundings steadily became more populated by the giant saguaros. It was at this point I noticed several blood-red flowers dotting the smaller ones. They were beautiful, like large rubies adorning green, spiny pedestals. One of the cacti stood taller than all the others and was covered in these flowers, as if a king amongst his nobles. This cactus was also distinct for appearing to have slightly red undertones to its otherwise green body. I chalked it up to the heat playing tricks on me at the time.

I came across another canyon about halfway through my run back to the trailhead. This one was far narrower than the one I had passed through earlier in the day. I would have to slow my pace to avoid getting trapped in the walls. It was here I began to see more clumps of the cougar hair and in larger amounts. The claw gouges in the wall were more prevalent in this canyon. Had it been dragged all the way here? Now I had no choice. I was certain I would come upon the beast soon.

After about an hour in the canyon, I saw the broken monster at last. It was still alive and half-transformed. Its misshapen body was horrific to look at. Half of its head was the cougar I had tracked, and the other half was human, but both showed the same yellow eyes. It let out a shriek that sounded like an amalgamation of an angry woman and a cougar while it lunged at me. I quickly sidestepped it and pulled out my blow darts. My shot lodged into its spine, crippling it. It was then I realized how badly it had been beaten. The monster's right leg was broken at the femur and its left hand was missing multiple digits.

The wolfsbane poison began to work its magic as the creature began to spasm, making the occasional failed attempt to swipe at my legs. I could've pulled out my revolver and put the psychotic thing out of its misery, but it felt as if something else was watching me, waiting for me to pull the trigger and signal my location. As the Skinwalker began losing the remainder of its motor function, I took in my surroundings and noticed that its blood had spilled in front of what appeared to be several carvings of men.

These carvings felt off, almost as if they were alive and carefully monitoring my every move. Had they been carved by a native tribe like the Hopi, or perhaps an ancient tribe like the Anasazi? I had little time to ponder this, as without warning another haboob whipped through the canyon, knocking me off my feet. I quickly rose and hung onto one of the carvings with my right hand while my left dug through my pack for my goggles. It felt like small cuts were opening all over my body as I put the goggles on so I could open my eyes. It was then that I realized that small rocks had been cutting me. No, not just rocks, cactus spines too? I confirmed the second object as several of them stuck into me.

After the cactus spines stuck in, the haboob quickly abated. The Skinwalker had at last succumb to its poison. Now that the immediate threat was gone, I could focus on the perceived threat in front of me. I looked at the carvings and noticed some of my blood had been carried up onto them by the winds. Cactus spines had lodged their way into them as well. I looked to the sky above and based on the color, it was now sunset. Before turning my gaze back to the canyon path, I noticed a familiar looking cactus. This couldn't be the same one I saw before. Had I just missed this huge saguaro looming above me? The color was different than the other cactus, so it had to be a new one. This saguaro was much darker, almost... red? That couldn't be right. This species doesn't turn that color.

When that realization hit me, I heard rocks begin to break around me, and the carvings began turning into living, breathing men. They sprang on me with unnatural speed and held me on the floor of the canyon and forced me to look up at the cactus at the top of the wall. My augmented strength was unable to free me from their iron grip as I watched the mighty saguaro unfurl into a humanoid form, now glowering at me with amber eyes. I could see a dust cloud begin to form around it. This was what was responsible for the two haboobs before. I felt the sand, pebbles, and spines cut my body and shred my clothes. My breathing grew ragged as I continued to fight against this localized storm and my captors.

At last, when the plant-like being had enough of blasting me with sand, I got a little reprieve. Or at least I thought until the spines began wiggling their way into the cuts and on my arms and legs. Those same red flowers began to sprout from where the spines had burrowed in. The grips of the men holding me in place grew stronger as these flowers grew. As I looked at the faces of these stone-cold beings, I recognized some of them from the missing persons reports we had reviewed before I was sent here. That Skinwalker was just as much prey as they were... as I was.

This humanoid cactus began turning to the same blood red as the flowers as it descended down the canyon wall. I had no idea what would happen if this thing got to me, so I had to act fast. I let loose a charge of electricity from my body to stun the men born of the wall carvings long enough to escape. I began to run, but a blinding pain shot through my back as this "Blood Cactus" hammered its arm into me. I expected the trickle of blood to follow, but it felt like my blood was being sucked out of my body and into the cactus.

My eyes darted around for any possible way out of this situation and fell on the Skinwalker's corpse. It had turned to stone. Looking at my own limbs, I could see the same process slowly happening to me. By now the Blood Cactus had stepped away from me while leaving its needles in my back. I saw what looked like thick threads running to its arm. No doubt these were carrying my blood into the abomination standing over me.

My arms began to tire as I could no longer hold the added weight up. I had enough energy left for another discharge, but I had to time it right. I mustered what remaining strength I had and threw a punch at the Blood Cactus. A structure akin to a mouth opened and swallowed my left hand. I screamed in sheer agony as I felt the spines inside the makeshift mouth begin to rotate and saw off the hand. It was now or never. I channeled the remaining electricity I had built up in my body and into the Blood Cactus, frying the demonic plant where it stood. The men around it began to fall, confirming the theory I built in my head that they were somehow linked.

Unfortunately, the stunt I pulled lost me my hand. Combining that with the blood loss, I shouldn't have been able to move let alone stand. That goes to show the power of adrenaline. I quickly swiped my trusty .454 off the floor and fired each round into the demon plant before jamming two of my wolfsbane darts into its amber eyes. In response, my foe shot out an inconceivable number of spines, taking out my right eye in the process. The men lying on the ground began to stir as I grabbed what remained of my gear and hobbled out of the canyon.

I took one final look at the scene I left behind to see that the Blood Cactus had ceased all movement. I saw one of the men look up at me before I turned away and could have sworn I heard him say, "Thank you," as he returned to being stone.

Eventually, I made it back to the Jeep on nothing but willpower and what was left of my adrenaline and radioed for immediate evac and a cleanup crew. I spent about three weeks in the ICU on base to repair my body. The ordeal left me roughly 40 percent machine afterwards. That meant I could no longer use the ability that saved me from the Blood Cactus. The Corps took in all the evidence, including the stone men to see if they could reverse the effects. It was discovered that the only way to awaken them is with human blood and that they are still in that trancelike state.

Our cleanup crew said that the Blood Cactus had disappeared by the time they reached the site. I slammed my fist through a table in response, livid at the fact that thing is still out there and could be harming more people, all the while, it could be creating an army of petrified soldiers to bring it prey. We sent a task force at my behest, but they have yet to find anything over the last six months.

Be careful if you find yourself in the Sonoran Desert and make sure to stick to the well-traveled areas.

**Farewell**

Since my escapades in Arizona, I have devoted my full time to researching the entity that took my beloved Katherine from me, yet it still eludes me at every turn. I have traveled the world in the meantime exterminating several more of the beasts meaning to do us harm and even helped in a joint effort to return a stranded alien to its people. It's the moments like those that really make this job worth it. I think the little guy is off somewhere in the Andromeda galaxy now.

My hunt for "The Cloak" - as I have dubbed the entity in the years since encountering it - has become more fruitful in those travels. I have met others who encountered it, and there seems to be one consistent pattern. It targets people who are happy or content with their lives and takes the thing they love most. The cryptic message I received was something new.

In my travels to Ireland, there was reference to a raven named Fiachna that follows those who have experienced great loss in their lives. While on this trip, I had to put down a particularly mischievous leprechaun, and unfortunately, Lucky Charms did not explode out of it after shooting it. I did not see this mythical raven, however. One change I noticed was in my shadow. Ever since that trip, I could swear that I caught it moving on its own a couple times. Perhaps this was just a trick of the light. I can hope this is the case. The last thing I need is my shadow trying to strangle me in my sleep while I'm trying to hunt down a much more dangerous beast.

My most recent mission in Germany led me to understand more about The Cloak than ever before. I asked a local Exterminator named Erwin if he knew anything about such an entity while on hunting down a couple rogue lycanthropes. He told me he knew of one person, a long-retired Exterminator, from his hometown in the German countryside who could help me on this quest. I will translate what the man told me.

This being you refer to as The Cloak has been known to exist since man first began using tools. I have encountered it twice in my life. The first time, it warned me to keep out of affairs in the supernatural realm and allow nature to take its course with humanity. I made the mistake of not heeding its warning and became prey for it. You see, it feeds off our fear, our despair, our cynicism, and it will do anything to get its fix. Many have come to me in search of information on this entity, but you seem to be of special interest, a rarity indeed. I have heard of few cases where it directly tells you when it will take your life. Do not mistake its warning for actually getting to see your lover again. Once someone passes beyond its veil into its empty void, they cease to exist. They do not go to Heaven or Hell, they do not get reincarnated. The soul is devoured completely, leaving no trace. I believe this being is primordial, predating any modern life. Due to its tendencies in how it chooses its victims, we have an old name for The Cloak. It views the name the Germanic tribes gave it as its true name, as we were the first to encounter it. Now, I give you the chance to walk out freely once and only once. If I tell you its name, you have signed your death warrant.

I told the man I was okay with this outcome. My existence has been painful since Katherine was taken from me. Although I will effectively be erased, I will be reunited with her in some way. That is enough for me.

The man gave me a grim nod and spoke the name:

"Der jaeger der ausrottet (The hunter who exterminates)."

I thanked the man and flew back to America to hopefully enjoy one final drink at the bar with Romulus where we first met. I let him know of my impending fate, and he gave me a big bear hug without any words as I felt a couple tears fall from his eyes.

I returned home, where I am now finishing my last journal entry. I can see The Cloak rising out of the mirror in front of me. Those malevolent, violet eyes are gazing into my soul. I'm terrified, but I'm ready to cease my existence with you Katherine. It's time to go to the void beyond.

\[TRANSCRIPT FROM THE RECORDING FOUND ON SOLOMON'S SECURITY CAMERA\]

\*Solomon sighs\* "It's time, Katherine. I was told I'll cease to exist beyond the veil, but I believe I'll see you on the other side. Der Jäger, der ausrottet. Führe mich hinter den Schleier."

\*The mirror shatters as the entity breaks through, slashing through Solomon with the scythe-like blade extending from its forearm. Solomon quietly accepts his fate as he is pulled into the hulking black mass.\*
