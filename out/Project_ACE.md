Isabella found the ad late one night, buried beneath sponsored job postings and shady “be your own boss” schemes. It was simple, vague, and just strange enough to feel legitimate:

> “Earn $10,000. One week commitment. Physically fit applicants only. Must be comfortable with water. Full discretion required.”

The link led to a sterile-looking form hosted on a university-affiliated research site. It mentioned experimental oxygen endurance testing and psychological conditioning in an “advanced aquatic environment.” No company name. No phone number. Just a location and a timer counting down to application cutoff.

“Wes, look,” she whispered, flipping her laptop toward him. Her boyfriend of three years leaned over, eyes heavy from a midnight study binge.

“Ten grand? What's the catch?”

“I think it’s a science trial or something. Water-based endurance stuff. We’re both swimmers. We could actually do this.”

Wesley arched an eyebrow. “Is it sketchy that it doesn’t say who’s running it?”

“Kind of,” she admitted. “But it’s through the university portal. Might just be new.”

He hesitated. “You think it's real?”

“I think we’re broke.”

They applied together that night. A week later, they got identical emails.

> “Congratulations. You have been selected. Transportation will arrive at 4:00 a.m. on August 12th. Do not bring personal items. You will be compensated upon successful completion of the trial. Welcome to the Threshold Program.”

The van windows were blacked out. No driver name. No talking. Just two silence-cracked hours that ended at the edge of a gray concrete facility, fenced off in rusted wire and overgrown grass. A wide steel door opened for them, swallowing them whole before hissing shut.



Inside, the air smelled sterile—like bleach and ice. A man in a white lab coat met them at the end of a long hallway, clipboard in hand, face unreadable.

“Wesley. Isabella. Welcome to the Abyssal Conditioning Environment—A.C.E.,” he said, not waiting for a handshake. “Follow me.”

He led them wordlessly through winding corridors. The walls were gray concrete, the ceilings lined with motionless cameras and low humming vents. Occasionally, a red light blinked. None of the rooms they passed had labels. No clocks. No windows. Just this slow march deeper underground.

Eventually, they reached a changing bay. Two black wetsuits and fitted helmets lay on a steel bench. Next to each was a heavy silver wristband and a thick coil of oxygen tubing.

“Suit up,” the man said. “You’ll be briefed shortly.”

“Wait—what kind of tests are we doing exactly?” Wesley asked, frowning.

“You’ll be briefed shortly,” the man repeated.

Isabella exchanged a look with Wes but said nothing. Her heart was thudding softly, but not from excitement anymore.

They slipped into the wetsuits. Cold. Skin-tight. The helmets clicked into place with a pressure-lock hiss, followed by the coiling of the oxygen tubes over their backs like thick, coiled snakes.

A side door slid open, revealing a narrow steel bridge leading to the edge of the pool chamber.

It was massive—round and perfectly still, like a sinkhole cut into the earth. The water was so dark it looked solid. There were no pool tiles, no ladders, no visible bottom. Just a glowing steel ring along the circumference and what looked like emergency floodlights clinging to the walls at different depths, flickering sporadically.

The scientist gestured them forward. “Step onto the platform.”

The floor beneath them was grated metal, suspended over the water. As soon as they stood centered, mechanical arms from the ceiling descended and clicked the oxygen tubes into fixed ports on either side. A locking sound echoed—too final.

Before they could ask anything, the platform gave a jolt—and began to descend into the water.

Cold crept up her suit as the surface climbed to their ankles, then knees. Isabella sucked in a breath. The helmet fogged slightly, then cleared with a mechanical hiss.

They sank.

Five feet. Fifteen. Thirty.

The water muffled the outside world completely. The only sound now was her breath, cycling steadily through the rebreather—shhh-THP. shhh-THP.

The pressure was heavier than she expected. Her chest ached faintly. Her mind wandered. What are we even doing? What is this really?

She looked over at Wesley. He gave her a thumbs up, trying to smile through his visor. It was shaky.

The comm line cracked to life inside her helmet.

“Welcome to the task zone,” the scientist’s voice said calmly. “Now that you are submerged, we’ll begin orientation.”

Now? Isabella thought.

“As of this moment, you are being monitored biologically and behaviorally. Each of your performances will directly affect your available oxygen. Tasks will be presented at timed intervals. Failure to complete a task will reduce your air. Success will restore it. Refusal or noncompliance will result in accelerated depletion.”

She turned her head sharply, bubbles trailing behind.

“You’re probably wondering if this is safe,” he continued. “That’s a matter of perception. But remember—you volunteered.”

Her stomach dropped. This wasn’t a research study.

It was a test.

And she had no idea what the rules really were.


The descent stopped with a sudden lurch. Metal groaned somewhere above, echoing through the water like a dying whale. The platform locked in place at what had to be at least fifty feet below the surface. Before them, two tunnel-like corridors stretched forward, dimly lit and pulsing with a faint blue glow—like veins in a sleeping beast.

Each corridor was sealed with a circular hatch. Above each one blinked a red light.

Then the comm line crackled in Isabella’s helmet again.

“You are now entering Phase One: Orientation,” the scientist’s voice said with cold clarity. “Ahead of you are two separate ingress points. Wesley will enter the left tunnel. Isabella, the right.”

She turned sharply toward Wes, her limbs suddenly feeling heavier in the water. He turned to her too, confusion etched in his eyes behind the visor. He held out his hand, fingertips brushing hers through the water.

The lights above the tunnels turned green.

“Your corridors will lead to different sectors of the simulation. The structure you are inside is a subaquatic maze—multi-tiered, reinforced, and fully controlled. We call it The House. You will navigate through individual challenges—physical, cognitive, emotional.”

Isabella’s heart started to race. The tube in her helmet tightened briefly, correcting airflow. Emotional?

“You will be reunited near the central axis if you complete your designated path segments successfully.”

“If?” Wesley’s voice finally came through. “What if we don’t?”

There was a pause—longer than it should have been.

“Then you won’t,” the scientist replied.

And with that, the hatches slid open.

The corridors beyond were darker than expected—narrow, angular, like hallways that didn’t belong under water. The lighting flickered. A long trail of blinking yellow lights marked the path forward for each of them.

Wesley gave Isabella a small, tight nod, then pushed forward and disappeared into the left corridor.

She hesitated at the mouth of hers.

The water felt thicker here. Heavier.

Why didn’t we ask more questions?

She moved into the tunnel.

The hatch sealed behind her with a deep, hydraulic thud.

The corridor ahead narrowed even more—its walls made of smooth composite plating, but not entirely straight. Almost… warped. Like they’d been softened by pressure, or heat. Strange symbols were etched faintly into the walls, barely visible behind the lights.

She wanted to call out, but the comms were silent now.

Alone in the humming water, she kicked forward.

Another light blinked above her wrist. Her oxygen display flickered:

O₂ Remaining: 89%

Then beneath it:

TASK 1 LOADING...

Her stomach twisted. Something moved just ahead.

A panel in the wall hissed open, revealing a small box.

Inside was a blinking red button and a glowing blue vial of something thick, like ink.

Then the text appeared across her visor, in bold digital font:

> *CHOOSE ONE:

PRESS THE BUTTON AND LOSE 15% OXYGEN

INJECT THE VIAL INTO YOUR SUIT’S FEEDLINE TO MAINTAIN OXYGEN, BUT RISK UNKNOWN SIDE EFFECTS.*

Isabella stared at it.

Her fingers hovered in the water.

And suddenly, she wasn’t sure she knew how to breathe anymore.









The corridor twisted and narrowed the deeper Wesley went. His heartbeat thudded louder than the breathing rhythm in his helmet. He kept glancing back—but the entry hatch was sealed tight. No going back.

Just ahead, a new room opened into view—circular and oddly tall, with dark walls and a low blue light that seemed to ripple like it was underwater even though they were underwater.

At the center of the room floated a mannequin.

But not a normal one.

It was suspended upright, arms out to the sides, its body covered in patches of what looked like wet cloth, draped and torn like hospital gowns. Long black cords connected it to the ceiling and floor, and its head was tilted back at an unnatural angle.

Its face was blank plastic—except for a set of tiny human teeth embedded where its mouth should be.

Wesley stopped short, bile rising in his throat.

Then his wristband vibrated.

He looked down just as it lit up:

> TASK 1

This unit contains the key to your next chamber.

You have 2 minutes to extract it.

The key is located behind its right eye.

Warning: Sudden movement triggers defensive countermeasures.

Failure to retrieve key will result in oxygen deduction and time penalty.

Timer: 1:59

Wesley’s hand shook as he read it again. Behind the eye? What the hell kind of task was this?

The mannequin's body drifted ever so slightly—like it was breathing.

He swam slowly toward it, careful not to stir the water too much.

As he neared, he saw something worse: scratch marks all around its neck and collar, like someone—or something—had tried to rip the cords off before.

Don’t think about that. Don’t think. Just move.

He reached out, trembling, and gently pressed one gloved finger to the edge of the mannequin’s face. The “eye” was just a smooth plastic sphere, but there was a faint seam around it. He slipped a small utility blade from the side of his suit and wedged it under the rim—

The mannequin twitched.

Wesley froze. His wristband buzzed:

Heart Rate Spike Detected. Penalty: -5% O₂

Remaining: 83%

“Come on,” he hissed to himself. He looked at the timer: 1:03

He pressed again—harder—and with a subtle pop, the eye came loose.

The key was lodged deep inside the socket, metallic and thin, coiled like a twist of bone. He reached in with two fingers and grabbed it—

Suddenly, a shrill, high-pitched scream erupted through the water.

The mannequin’s arms jerked open, flailing violently, its mouth stretching impossibly wide as a second set of smaller arms burst from its abdomen and clawed outward, flailing blindly.

Wesley kicked back in a panic, key clutched in his hand.

Wrist Alert: Oxygen Penalty -10%

Remaining: 73%

He shot toward the upper hatch as it creaked open above him—far too slow.

Behind him, the mannequin’s cords were snapping one by one.

He didn’t look back again.

He surged through the hatch just as the last cord snapped—and the scream cut out.

---

Wesley collapsed into the next chamber, floating in the dim corridor, gasping even though the oxygen feed was steady. He turned back toward the hatch.

It was sealed again.

And something on the other side was still moving.







The vial floated in its small chamber, swirling with something that didn’t quite look like liquid. It pulsed faintly with a blue light, like it was breathing on its own. Next to it, the red button blinked steadily—quiet, almost polite.

Isabella hovered in the narrow tunnel, staring at both options.

Her wrist display flashed again:

> O₂ Remaining: 89%

PRESS THE BUTTON — LOSE 15% OXYGEN

INJECT THE VIAL INTO SUIT — MAINTAIN OXYGEN / UNKNOWN EFFECTS

Timer: 00:45

She bit the inside of her cheek.

Fifteen percent. It didn’t sound like much, but how many of these tasks were there? And what if something went wrong later—what if she needed every ounce?

Her fingers hovered over the red button.

But something in her gut twisted.

She turned her head toward the vial.

It was connected to a small feed port—designed to inject directly into her suit’s hydration line, just under her collar. There was no label. No warning. Just a blinking green light above it, waiting for her decision.

Timer: 00:28

If this was just a test, they wouldn’t give us something that could kill us. Right?

But nothing about this place had felt safe since the moment the platform began to descend.

A soft chime played in her helmet—gentle, mechanical.

Timer: 00:17

Her hand moved.

Don’t do it, her instinct said.

Do it, something deeper replied.

She gritted her teeth, grabbed the vial, and slid it into the injector port.

There was a brief suction hiss, then a cold rush through her suit—like ice water pouring down her spine. She gasped. Her limbs seized for a second, like something had passed through her.

Wrist Display:

> O₂ Stable – 89%

VIAL ABSORPTION COMPLETE

PHYSIOLOGICAL MONITORING ENGAGED

Her heart pounded. She floated still, waiting—bracing.

Then the pain started.

It wasn’t sharp—just wrong. A sensation behind her eyes, like they were vibrating in their sockets. Her vision blurred for a second, then twisted unnaturally.

The walls of the tunnel around her seemed to breathe—inhale, exhale, slow and unnatural. The symbols carved into the walls pulsed like they were watching her now.

Her body relaxed, almost involuntarily. She wasn’t sure if she was calm or if something had chemically sedated her thoughts.

“Good,” the voice crackled in her helmet. “You made a proactive choice. That’s what we like to see.”

They were watching the whole time.

The light at the end of the corridor turned green.

The hatch opened slowly.

And something moved in the shadows beyond it—just out of sight.

But now her vision was still warped.

She wasn’t sure if it was the light…

Or if it was her that had changed.







The corridor narrowed, then opened suddenly into a chamber that felt too big. Wesley floated just inside the threshold, staring out at a silent, artificial seascape.

Steel pillars, broken crates, and strange coral-like structures jutted from the floor in a jagged layout—like a shipwreck had been scattered here on purpose. Blue floodlights pulsed from above, casting eerie shadows over everything. A fine silt floated through the water, making it hard to see more than twenty feet ahead.

It looked like a training course.

It felt like a trap.

His wrist buzzed. He flinched.

> TASK 2 – INITIATED

Objective: Retrieve the magnetic key from the central crate.

Caution: Presence of live apex predator detected.

Do not swim quickly. Use cover to avoid detection.

O₂ Remaining: 73%

Remaining Tasks: 5

Predator?

He didn’t even have time to finish the thought before something massive shifted in the fog of silt ahead.

Wesley froze.

There. Between two ruined pillars—a low silhouette moving with purpose.

A shark. Long. Fast. Mottled gray skin. At least ten feet.

Real.

No animatronics moved like that.

The shark glided silently, weaving between debris like it knew every inch of the space. It wasn’t hunting yet. Just patrolling.

The magnetic crate was visible now—half-buried in the middle of the chamber, marked with a blinking green light.

But getting there meant crossing at least thirty feet of open water.

Wesley ducked behind the nearest structure—an overturned locker or vent shaft. The metal groaned slightly beneath his grip. He sucked in a slow breath.

The shark looped again. Closer.

He waited until it passed out of sight, then kicked toward the next chunk of cover—a rusted-out barrel welded to the floor. As he slid behind it, he saw something etched into the steel:

> IT WATCHES STILL

His wrist buzzed again.

> Heart Rate Elevated

Penalty Warning: O₂ Consumption Increasing

He clenched his fists. Focus. You’re not dying in a test pool.

The next swim was longer. He launched from cover to cover, weaving behind an old steel frame and a bent solar panel that barely offered protection.

Then, mid-swim, the shark reappeared from the silt—right in front of him.

It stopped.

Frozen.

Its eye turned, locking on him.

Wesley’s legs twitched. He tried to still them, but instinct betrayed him. A small kick. One bubble.

The shark turned fast—charged.

He dove behind a chunk of wall just as the shark slammed into it, denting the metal, rattling his whole body.

O₂ PENALTY: -10%

Remaining: 63%

He didn’t scream—but he wanted to.

The shark hovered now, right on the other side of the wall. Its nose brushed the edge like it could smell him through the suit.

Then, after a long pause… it drifted away.

He waited a full minute before moving.

The crate was ten feet away.

He swam slowly, hands trembling, body aching from tension. The key slot was magnet-locked, but his tool from the last task worked—barely.

Inside: a new black puck. Slightly glowing.

As he reached for it, a reflection appeared on the lid.

Behind him. Fast.

The shark had returned.

He grabbed the key and bolted—zigzagging through the obstacles, kicking harder now, abandoning stealth. It was chasing him. The whole chamber seemed to rattle.

He dove behind the final pillar just as the shark slammed into it again. A chunk of metal broke loose, spinning through the water like shrapnel.

The exit hatch began to open.

He surged for it.

The shark turned sharply—one final charge—and Wesley barely slid through the door before it struck the edge.

The hatch slammed shut.

Silence.

He curled in the corner of the next tunnel, panting, heart screaming in his ears.

Wrist Display:

> Task 2 Complete

Remaining Tasks: 4

O₂ Remaining: 59%

Behind him, the wall boomed once more.

It wasn’t just a predator.

It had learned his route.

And it wasn’t finished yet.
