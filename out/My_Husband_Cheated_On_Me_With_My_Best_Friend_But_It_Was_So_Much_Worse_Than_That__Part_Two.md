Some and now none of you  
Take me back to the night we met.”  
The Night We Met- Lord Huron  
\-  
  
Lilith was more than my best friend. She was more than a sister. She was my soulmate.   
Now she’s something else.   
I didn’t know exactly what that something else was, and that scared me.  
I was so fucking lost.  
I’m still fucking lost.  
\-  
The clouds started to roll in, covering over what was looking like a perfect day. I could see lightning in the distance, but the thunder was just a weak rumble on the growing wind.  


My hand was warm.  


Jim was flipping burgers on the grill in our backyard, and the smell was making my stomach growl. He was smiling at me while I set the rest of the table, trying desperately not to drop the bowls of chips and dip as twenty little girls were running around me. Their faces were all painted and most of them had balloons tied to their wrists. There was a great clump of balloons tied to the middle of the table. I worried that they were going to take the table up with them.   
Jessica was so happy. It was her birthday.  


I was having trouble breathing.  


She kept asking me if she could open her presents. She was standing right next to the mound of packages that her friends had brought for her. All the wrapping paper was different, but the boxes were all the same shape; a perfect six inch square.  
“Please Mommy!”  
“Ask your Daddy.”  


My hand was burning.  


She ran over to Jim. All the mothers of Jessica’s friends were crowded around him. They were all laughing. He was smiling. There was a blindfold on every one of them. He ignored Jessica.  
It started to sprinkle. The drops were steaming up the grill. The air was getting thicker.  


I felt someone take my hand. Lilith was standing next to me. She was smiling, but something was wrong with her eyes. They were milky; almost clear. Small little veins of glowing yellow ran through them. I heard the crack of thunder as the veins in her eyes throbbed and streaked like electricity. I tried to let go of her hand, but she wouldn’t let me.  


I screamed for Jim to help, but when I turned towards him, he was tangled in the middle of all of the mothers. They were naked and sweating and moaning. The smell of what he was doing to them filled the sultry air.  
It made my stomach turn.  


My hand was on fire.  


The blindfolds were still over the women’s eyes. Large movie cameras were set up all around them. Jim was laughing at me while he took turns with every woman.  
I tried to run to Jessica. I had to get her away. I didn’t want her to know that her father was a monster. Lilith pulled back on my hand, and I fell to the ground at her feet. She wouldn’t let go of my hand.   
I screamed at Jessica to run, but her friends circled her. Each of them held a present. Each of them had a blank expression on their face. Each of them had the same eyes as Lilith.  


In unison they said, “Open mine fist. You’re my soulmate.”  
I screamed at them to get away from her, but my voice was drowned out by the screamings coming from Jim and his women.   
The thunder was furious.   
The lightning was everywhere.   
The rain started to fall.   
The drops were gobs of clear jelly. Every surface they struck began to melt. They pounded Jim and his women. Their flesh began to dissolve. The balloons floating above the table all began to pop.  


My hand felt like it was melting.  


I struggled to free myself from Lilith’s hand. I looked up to see that my hand was gone. It had been absorbed into Lilith. Her hand had turned into a clear blob that was dripping down past my elbow.  
\-  
I woke up covered in sweat, but I couldn’t move. It was a strange feeling. I had read about sleep paralysis, and I’ve even had patients describe it to me, but it felt different than what I had read or been told of. Like coming out of anesthesia. It was slow, but the pain in my hand was constant.  
I couldn’t crane my neck down to look at it for a few minutes, but I was able to see the door to the motel room.  


It was slightly cracked.  


Jessica was still asleep in the bed. I could see her breathing.  
When I was finally able to move, I crawled off of the bed and over to the door. When I reached up to close it and lock it, I saw the burn marks on the top of my right hand.  
Thin lines of bubbled blistering flesh.  
I crawled through the room, searching every inch to make sure that my baby and I were alone.  
\-   
The sun was just starting to come up. I could see the light through the foggy window in the shower. I was running the burn on my hand under cold water.  
It was more than just a burn.  


The word, “Soulmate” was scarred onto the top of my hand. The letters were pencil thin.   
Chemical burns.   
Lilith had been in our room, and for some reason, I slept through the whole thing.  
I thought she had somehow drugged me.  
I couldn’t make heads or tails of it.  
My brain was still foggy.  
I sat in a cold sweaty heap on the toilet lid. I stared at my phone for a long while before I turned the screen on.  
The text from Lilith was from three hours prior. It had still been dark when she took the picture.  
She was following me.  
I obviously had no idea what she was capable of.  
I couldn’t avoid it any longer. I sent her a text.  
*“I just want you to leave us alone.”*  
\-  
The answer didn’t come right away. Jessica was still asleep while I was looking through the curtains of the room. There were already a couple of people in the parking lot. Any one of them could have been her.  
I waited.  
And waited.  
The phone vibrated in my hand.  


*“Amy, I already told you. You never have to be alone again. Neither do I. Just call me. I want to hear your voice. We can talk this through.”*  


The text had a picture. It was her hand, and it had the same scar that she had given to me.  
\-  
Jessica was rubbing the sleep out of her eyes when I carried her to the car. I was about to open the door when I noticed there were a couple of cameras in the parking lot.  
I had to see how she got in.  
\-  
Jessica was crying and I was busy promising her that we would get something to eat while the front desk clerk was looking through the video feeds.  
He was a young kid and it didn’t take that much for me to convince him to let me behind the desk while he scrolled back to the time when Lilith took the picture of my car.  
I watched time lapse backwards while I swayed with Jessica in my arms.  
When he finally brought up the time, I could see someone standing behind my car. It wasn’t Lilith. It was a tall man dressed in a long coat.  


The man walked away from my car and as he passed under an overhead light, he turned his head and looked directly into the camera and smiled as he walked on, out of frame.  
It was Jim.  


I thought about Lilith’s text.  
*I can look any way I want. I can sound any way I want.*  
I asked the kid to run the video forward. I never saw Lilith go into the room. She must have come in some other way than the front door. Two hours or so after “Jim” took a picture of my car, I watched him walk out of my motel room. He was naked. He pushed the door to the jam behind him and then he walked out of frame.  
\-  
I ran through the parking lot and crammed Jessica into her car seat.  
“Oww! Mommy! You hurt me!”  
“Angel, I’m sorry. Mommy’s just… Mommy’s just in a hurry. It’s ok.”  
“Where are we going?”  
“We’re going to go see Grandma and Grandpa. I’m sorry if Mommy’s making you upset.”   


She started to cheer at the thought of seeing her grandparents. I was buckling her in when I heard someone walk up behind me; heavy boots on gritty pavement. I slammed the back door shut and turned around.  


“Excuse me Miss. Are you alright? You need some help?” He was a big man. Big accent. He was wearing jeans and a flannel. He was standing too close to me. He was looking around the parking lot.  
“I’m fine, thank you.” I opened my door and got inside. As I pulled the door closed, it stopped. One of the man’s big hands was holding it open. He moved forward. I couldn’t close the door. He leaned down and stared at me with a look of concern.  


“Miss, you don’t seem alright. A man sees a woman out in the middle of nowhere, looking like you do, all helpless and alone… well he wants to make sure everything’s hunky dory.”  
“Get away from my car.”  
“You look like you need help. Maybe a friend. I could be your friend.” He winked at me and smiled. He had a gold tooth.   


My mouth went dry. My first thought was that it was Lilith, but then a worse thought settled in.   
This wasn’t her. Maybe this was something worse. The parking lot was empty and there was a huge man not letting me leave.   
Jessica must have sensed something was wrong. She started to cry in the backseat. I put my hand inside my purse.  
“Get the fuck away from my car!”  
“I could be your friend. Hell, I could even be her Daddy if you wanted me to.” He started to unzip his pants with his free hand. I pulled the butcher knife out of my purse and slashed it across his stomach.  
As he yelled and stepped back, I pulled the door closed and drove off.  
\-   
I was driving down through San Antonio.   
I kept looking at the drops of blood that had hit the inside of my door.  
I swore that every driver in every car I passed was looking at me. There were also cars that seemed to follow me.  
\-  
At one point, there was a wreck. We were stopped in the middle lane. No one was moving anywhere.  
I made sure the doors were locked over and over again, afraid somehow that they had come unlocked by themselves. I kept looking at all the other drivers around me. The person in front of me kept looking back at me in their rearview.  
My heart was racing.  
I was lightheaded.  
A man to my immediate left began to stare at me when he realized that I kept looking over towards him. He was smiling and saying something to me.  
I swear he was saying my name.  
It had to be her.  
I stifled a scream when I heard my phone vibrating in the center console. The message came up on the screen in my car. After I pressed the screen to listen, I heard Lilith’s words through the artificial voice of my car. It made it worse somehow.  
Emotionless.  
*“Which one am I? It’s got to be driving you crazy. Take a guess.”*  
I looked at everyone around me. With the exception of the smiling guy, everyone was looking down at their phones.  
Another text.  
*“Probably a good time to use some of those coping tools you’re always trying to sell to your patients. Let me know if they work.”*  
I was sweating. I was trying to keep my breathing at a steady pace.   
The smiling man got out of his car and walked over to my window. He was asking me why I didn’t want to talk to him.  
Another text came through.  
*“This is disgusting. It’s obvious from the look on your face that something is wrong and this guy thinks it's ok to do that.Do you want me to take care of him?”*  
I looked back at Jessica. She was coloring. She hadn’t noticed anything.  
*“Just call me and I’ll make him go away.”*  


“Angel, Mommy needs you to put your hands over your ears,ok?”  
“Ok.”  
I cracked the window and I kept my voice low.  
“Get the fuck away from my car!” I put the window back up as the smiling man stopped smiling. He called me a couple of names and then he spit on my window before he walked back to his own car.  
“Can I take my hands off my ears Mommy?” She was shouting.  
I nodded.  
I could see the guy get back into his car from the corner of my eye. He was scowling and saying something while the gob he spat on my window slimed its way down to the door.  
The cars began to inch forward.  
*“I’ve had enough. I want you to call me. Now.”*  


I sent her one back.  
*“Fuck off.”*  


I stopped looking at the other drivers. We were starting to move a little faster. She sent me another text. I shouldn’t have opened it.  
That cold artificial voice filled my car for the last time. I cried when I heard my daughter’s nickname that her favorite person in the world gave her.  


*“Hey Thunder Bug, it’s Auntie Lilith! I’m right behind you guys! Tell Mommy to give me a call so I can hear your sweet little voice.”*  
Jessica was overcome with excitement as the car read her Auntie's words out loud.  
She was squealing and she kept asking me to call Lilith. She was looking around in her car seat, trying to get a glimpse of her Auntie. Tears were coming out of my eyes but I was keeping my voice as steady as I could.  
“Honey, we’re not going to be able to call Auntie right now.”  
There would be no phone calls. No more texts. I turned my phone off.  
\-  
My parents were happy to see us. Jessica was all over them for about an hour until I finally sat her down to watch her cartoons.  
I kept checking all of their doors and their windows.  
I laid everything out on the table for my parents. I knew how I sounded. I knew they were concerned that I had lost my mind.   
My parents had always loved Lilith. Why wouldn’t they? She was perfect.   
Until she wasn’t.  
I told them what happened. Who Jim really was. What Lilith really was. I showed them her texts. I showed them my hand. They listened.  
They asked me what I wanted to do.  
I told them my plan. They didn’t like it.  
I felt like I didn’t have a choice.  
\-  
I was sitting in the hometown dive bar. I saw a lot of people I remembered from highschool. People who never made it out of my little hometown.   
I envied them.   
I let my hair down over my face. I didn’t say hi to anyone, I just wanted to blend into the background. I just wanted a place with lots of people.  
I saw myself in the mirror behind the bar when I ordered my bourbon and coke. I looked like hell.  
I sat down in the darkest booth I could find. The bright white bandage on the top of my right hand made me feel like I was a target even though I was in the shadows.  
I had sent Lilith a text and asked her to meet me at the bar. I was already shaking from what was about to happen, and the cold air inside the bar wasn’t helping.  
I had given my parents a safe word. If I came home or someone who looked like me came home, they weren’t allowed to open the door unless the word was said. I hoped it wouldn’t come to that.  
I hoped there was still some kind of humanity in my friend.  
\-  
I sat there for an hour. I felt like I was being watched. I wondered if she didn’t trust that I just wanted to talk. I started to doubt that she would show up, and then I heard a familiar song on the jukebox.  
“I am not the only traveler,  
who has not repaid his debt.  
I’ve been searching for a trail to follow again,  
Take me back to the night we met.”  
I watched the inside of the bar, but I couldn’t see her anywhere. I turned and looked behind me, and when I turned around again, she was there. Sitting across from me in the booth.  
My Lilith.  
The conversation was awkward at first. Long pauses. Deep breaths.  
“Hi.”  
“Hi.”  
“You’re shaking.”  
“I’m cold.”  
“I don’t want you to be afraid of me.”  
“I’m terrified of you.”  
“Then why are you here?”  
“Because, I should have talked to you. I shouldn’t have run away like that.”  
“I shouldn’t have scared you. I shouldn’t have threatened you. I didn’t know what to do just to get you to talk to me. I wish none of this had ever happened.” Her eyes started to well up.  
“Me too.”  
“Amy. I always wanted to tell you. I could never figure out how to explain it in a way that you wouldn’t think I was some kind of monster. I didn’t ask to be this way.”  
“I understand.” I was trying not to cry, but it hurt so much. I was staring at my friend. I wasn’t staring at a monster.   
I was staring at the one person who was always with me. The one person who always made everything better.  
“I have nothing left to hide, Amy. When I first met you, I had never felt that way for anyone or anything. I can’t even explain it. I’d seen so many people come and go for so long, they all just kind of blend into a meaningless mass. They’re indistinguishable from each other. I had never met anyone who was real.”  
She went on, talking about that night. She started talking about every good thing we’d ever been through together.  
Everything she was saying was perfect. She just wanted to be with me.   
I was laughing. We were both smiling.  
We had another drink.  
She kept talking.   
If you’re lucky enough in life, you’ll fall in love with someone so much that it goes beyond anything physical. Nothing else matters beyond just being next to them. I was next to her again.  
It felt like it always did, but I knew it shouldn’t.  
I was lost in her words for a long while until I realized that I was starting to drown in them.  
The words were familiar. The phrases set off distant warning bells in my brain. I’ve read them and heard them before. Case studies I’ve read and therapy sessions I’ve had with women who were lucky enough to get away from toxic relationships unscathed, only to be pulled back into a predator’s claws by nothing more than words.  


All those women had scars that went with their stories.   


I had a new scar. I began to rub it through the bandage while she kept talking. It hurt.  
I looked down at her hand and wondered if what I saw there was even a real scar. How could it be? It was an imitation. Was she really able to cry, or was that just something she imitated to seem more human? I wanted to believe her.  
God, I wanted to believe her so badly.  
She kept talking. I fought the temptation to just give in to her. I had to stick to my plan.  
I had to do it for myself. I had to do it for my daughter.  
I would put her intentions to the test. Not outright rejection, just space. I asked her to stop talking, and then I took a deep breath.  
“Lilith… I think I need time.”  
“What? Time for what?”  
“The things you do…”  
“The things I have to do to survive.”   
“You kill people.”  
“Bad people.”  
“As far as you knew, Jim was only cheating on me. That doesn’t mean he deserved to die.”  
“Are you serious?”  
“And you’ve also hurt me.” I held up my hand. “Terrified me. I just… I need some time to think. I don’t want to cut you off, I just need… please, just give me some time. This is all too much right now.”  
She smiled. She reached over the table and held my hand.  
“Is it? Do you think you’re any different? Do you think you wouldn’t do whatever it took to survive?”  
“I wouldn’t kill anyone.”   


Her smile grew wider. Too wide; a cartoonish exaggeration of a smile. Her eyes were twitching. She was angry, and I thought she was starting to lose control of her appearance.  
“Well, why don’t we see what you would do? You get an easy one. Look over at the end of the bar.”  
I turned. It took me a second, but I saw the big man from the motel parking lot. He was standing behind a group of people trying not to be seen.   
I looked back at Lilith, and that’s when I felt it. A small pin prick on my hand under hers. Then I felt nothing except warmth spreading up my arm and all over my body. I was numb. It was hard to breathe.  
I couldn’t move anything but my eyes.  


“You won’t be able to move for about an hour. I didn’t put too much in you. Just enough.” She raised her glass of bourbon and shot the rest of it down. “You’re just not having very much luck with men lately, are you? That corn pone son of a bitch has been following you ever since you left that motel. He came in just after you and he’s been watching you the whole time, just waiting for that perfect moment to get you alone. Gee, I wonder what his plans were when you got up and walked through the parking lot back to your car?”  
I tried to say something, but nothing came out.  


“So you wouldn’t kill someone even if it meant surviving? I got a thought for you Amy. If I get up and walk away from you now, do you think he’d leave you alone? How long do you think it would take him to figure out you were incapacitated? You look drunk to me. I guess you think a piece of shit like that deserves to live. Well, who am I to stand in the way?”  
She touched my face.  
“Goodbye Amy.”  
Lilith got up and left me. I heard her footsteps going toward the door, and then I heard it open and close. I couldn’t do anything but sit there. I kept trying to scream, but the only thing I felt was the drool sliding down my chin.  
There was a clock on the wall behind the bar that I could just make out of the corner of my eye.  
I watched the minutes tick by.  


Five minutes  


Six  


Ten  


Seventeen  


Twenty eight  


Thirty seven minutes.    


I heard someone coming up behind me; heavy boots on a gritty wood floor.  
The big man sat down across from me. His gold tooth shined.  
“Looks like someone’s had a little too much. Remember me darling?”  
He snapped his fingers in front of my face.  
“Shit! This is going to be way easier than I expected it to be.”  
I hated Lilith.   
She knew he was there the whole time.  
She let this happen.  
She never said anything.  
I swore that if I survived whatever was about to happen, I’d make her pay.  
“Damn.” He clicked his tongue. “I’d say you’re just about perfect for me. Why don’t we go for a little drive?”  
  
“Have you got room for three?” I heard Lilith’s voice behind me. She walked over and scooted herself on the seat next to the big man. She looked so small next to him.  
I could tell he was confused. He looked around the bar and then back down to Lilith.  


“Aren’t you just adorable?” She was using an exaggerated Texas accent. “We were wondering where the real men were in this town.”  
“Hi. You uh… I thought your friend was alone.”  
“Oh, you get two for the price of one tonight, Hoss.” She grabbed his hand and clapped it on her breast. She giggled and bit her bottom lip. He smiled. He seemed dumbstruck at what he must have thought was good luck. He started to rub her breast. She reached down and I saw her hand disappear into his pants. She looked at me while she moved her hand and he moaned.  
“Holy hell, that’s nice.” He closed his eyes, but Lilith’s were stuck on mine.  


“What do you say Amy? You gotta choose now. Give me one blink, and I’ll leave. Two blinks says you want me to fix it. You got two seconds.”  
The big man was gritting his teeth and grabbing at the table.  
I could feel my fingers start to twitch. She put me in this position.   
I wanted to scream.   
My heart was racing.  
Sweat was running down my temples.   
I blinked once, and then I blinked again. She smiled at me.  


Lilith turned and started to suck on the big man’s ear and she whispered, “Does that feel good?”  
“Hell yeah, it does.”  
“Do me a favor.”  
“Anything.”  
“I want you to look at my friend. I want you to look in her eyes while I finish you off.”  
The big man looked into my eyes.   
“I think I can do that.” He raised his eyebrows and licked his gold tooth.  
Then his body jerked and he froze. His eyes started to dart back and forth between me and Lilith.  
Lilith took his hand from her breast and put it on the table in front of us.  


“I guess you’re no better than me, Amy.” She pulled up his sleeve and she slowly began to trace her finger along his arm. I could smell his flesh burning.   
The tip of her finger had lost all of its color. I watched it sink slightly into his skin.  
When she was done, there was a fresh wound that was still sizzling. The words, “Amy’s First” were burned into his blistered flesh.   
She reached over and opened his mouth. She put two of her fingers in his mouth.  


“You want to see something really scary, Amy?” She smiled at me. She pulled her hand away from his mouth, and I could see that her index and middle fingers were gone.  
A burbling sound came from the big man. His jaw was hanging down and it reminded me of a nutcracker. A small trail of blood started to dribble down his chin. He kept his eyes on me.  
Blood started to run from his nose, and then out of his ears. His eyes rolled upwards, dumbly staring at the ceiling. After a few more moments, the life was gone from his eyes and his nostrils began to flare.   
Two translucent fingers wormed their way out of his nostrils. Lilith held her hand underneath them and they fell into her palm. The color of Lilith’s flesh came back to them as they re-attached themselves.   
She dabbed the blood away from his face.  
“You still need time? Or have I made myself clear?”  
I was breathing hard. I was starting to feel again. I tried my best.  
“Ffffff…uck..yyy…”  
“Alright. I tried being nice. I helped you. Now I’m really going to hurt you.”

She left me again.  
\-  
It was another twenty minutes before I could move. I grabbed my phone and called my parents.  
Nothing.  
To everyone there, I just looked like a drunk on wobbly legs as I left.  
When I got to the parking lot, my car was gone.  
I called my parents' house again.  
Nothing.  
I was just going to call the police when my phone started to vibrate.  


Lilith.   
I answered it. It was exactly what I was [afraid](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyhorribles/) of.  
“Hi Mommy! Auntie Lilith came by and picked me up!”
