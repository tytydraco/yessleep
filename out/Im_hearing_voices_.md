No, not the type you’re thinking. 

I was born with Charles Bonnet syndrome, don’t know how rare it is to happen but it’s usually what happens to old people with severe loss of sight. 
Their brain adjusts itself causing visual hallucinations. 
We didn’t know for many years until adulthood, as a child, the imaginary friends were just that, as a teen an embarrassment and worrying to that I apparently had depression and yeah, details. 
Eventually around four or five years ago, they realised what it was. 

I can and always have been able to see perfectly however. 
Never ever needed glasses, been told I have better than 20-20 vision. 

So for my whole life I’ve been seeing everything perfectly along with people that aren’t really there. 

Three weeks ago I went to a doctor that claimed he could stop the hallucinations without any damage to my eyesight. That he’d tried it on the elderly (with permission of course) and they’d reportedly stopped talking to thin air. 

It was at a private hospital, everything looked normal, was normal. 
Waited around 45 mins before seeing the guy, and yeah he was just a normal old dude. 
He handed me a pill for a trial run, see if I took to them. 
It definitely took to me. 

Everything was fine for a few days, still saw some pop ins and pop outs but nothing that stayed, then they slowly faded out too by day 5. I went back to get more pills. 

After that second pill, everything was perfect until day 5. I hadn’t seen anything I shouldn’t be. 
But then I heard a voice. 
It sounded like it was a shout far behind me and to the left but somehow inside my house. 
I couldn’t make out what it said. 
I put it off to someone outside but I’m hearing echos or whatever. 

Then it happened again a few hours later at work, the exact same voice but louder. Closer. 
It sent shivers down my spine. 
I looked around hoping to see a co-worker. 
Something about it scared me, I still couldn’t understand it but my hairs were on end. 

Then nothing the rest of the day, nor the day after. 
So I took the third pill unbeknownst to what it would do. 

Yesterday I went to work, said hello to a few people and sat down to start typing. 
Couple of hours passed and I heard my name being called from the pod next to me. 
I looked over and saw an empty pod. 
I thought it was weird so sat back to work, then I heard my name being called again by the same co-worker from the same pod. 
I didn’t move at first this time, I just spoke back. 
We had a normal conversation about life and whatnot and at some point I stood and looked over the pod wall. 

It was empty. 
My co-worker wasn’t in it. 
Then he spoke. 
It came from the pod, I was confused, I was reminded of the weird voice, and I started shaking. The thought of having auditory hallucinations was totally foreign to me, I couldn’t handle it. It scared the crap out of me. 
The visual was only fine because of dealing with it since birth. 
Then he spoke again, asked if I was ok. 
It sounded genuine, it gave me a weird tingling all over my body as I felt the pressure of a hand on mine. 
I pulled my hand away and heard someone breathe deeply and again ask if I was alright, 
I couldn’t see him. But he was there. 

Some of my other co-workers heard him, and came over, I could see them, so I put my hand out to touch one of them. 
Before it reached him, he vanished in front of my eyes. Like if I blinked him out of existence. 
He still spoke to me. 

I had a panic attack on the spot. I fell to my knees. 
Everything went blurry which made everything worse. I couldn’t breathe but then someone placed their hand on the top of my head. 
It stopped everything and I managed to calm down. 
I looked up and it was my manager, she didn’t ask if I was alright, she instead said it will be alright as she reached down to hug me and became another invisible ghost. 

I wept all night, I kept hearing people and seeing people disappear on my way home. 
I don’t know how bad it is now.
I called the doctor, I have an appointment next week. 
I still keep hearing that shouting again though, I still don’t know what it’s saying but it sounded like it was in the same room last time it happened.
