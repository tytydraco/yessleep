Let me first say that I’m surprised at how many people seemed to care about my [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l2vz85/i_followed_a_woman_to_a_private_pool_and_i_cant/). Feels nice. I can see why people post here.



I didn’t plan on a part two. I figured I would share the weird thing that happened to me on the scary story board, and people would be happy with that. But I guess I told the story so good, you want more. I get it. The only problem is, what happened next is even harder to believe. I’m not sure I even believe it myself.



Here’s the logical explanation: After I fell in the water, I passed out, some weird things happened in my head, and then I woke up. That happens, right? People pass out and see heaven, or an alternate life where they’re Chinese. Maybe that’s what happened to me.



When I woke up, I was laid out on the dirty tile floor of the pool lobby, surrounded by gawkers and paramedics. My target was gone. She was the one that alerted the clerk I had fallen in. I guess she saved my life. I don’t understand why she would do that, but I reckon I’m thankful.



But... that’s not all I remember about that night. In my head, there was a whole lot more to it. There was a… something, in the water. Then a boat. Then an island. I felt like I was in that “room” all night, but the clerk says he pulled me out only a couple minutes after I fell in. It doesn’t make sense.



When I wrote the first part, I was convinced that I had imagined all of the stuff in between. But over the last few nights, I’ve been dreaming about it constantly. I’m not a creative person, so I find it hard to believe my brain could come up with all of this. And it feels so real to me; I can still remember the sea creatures, and the man on the boat’s smile, and the sand.



I’ll never understand why people care to read this shit, but… I guess I’ll just tell you what I remember, and let you decide for yourselves whether I’m making it all up.



—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



“Come back you fucking bitch!” I screamed in the dark. “Open the fucking door!”



I splashed my arms against the water, furious.



How had I fallen in? I saw how far away the door was from the pool before the pool lights went out, and I wasn’t anywhere close. In fact, I was seconds away from grabbing the handle and getting out. But then, all at once, the floor was water. It didn’t make sense. It’s like the pool had reached out and grabbed me.



“Good trick! Yeah, alright, you got me!” I shouted again, my words muffled like a pouty child screaming into a pillow. She couldn’t hear me. She was free, and I was here in this fucking pool.



*You’re stuck with it tonight*, she had said.



Stupid, random bullshit. What, was she trying to scare me? Act like I was taking her place watching over whatever was in the water? Right. No, the truth was that I had severely misjudged distances, and the size of the pool, and I was just turned around. If I picked a direction and swam, I’d find the edge eventually.



So, I started swimming.



The salt water had flooded my eyes when I fell into the pool, and they were stinging like a motherfucker. Not that they were doing me much good anyways. I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face.



I couldn’t find the edge anywhere. And I was starting to get tired.



To make matters worse, my goddamn clothes were sticking to me like cling wrap. I could feel them getting heavier and heavier, dragging against my every stroke. I couldn’t go on swimming like this. I would have to strip.



I peeled off my shirt and let it sink silently down to the bottom of the pool. It skimmed my foot on the way down. I realized then that I hadn’t touched the bottom yet. How deep did this pool go?



There’s a stretch of the Wharfe River in Yorkshire, England called The Strid. It’s only 6 feet across, and from the outside, it looks like any other quaint English creek. If you made the mistake of taking a swim, however, you’d take one step into the water and quickly realize that the bottom is 700 feet beneath.



In my mind, the pool was even deeper. I imagined diving down, feeling for the bottom, swimming past schools of fish, sea turtles, shipwrecks, leviathans with tentacles a mile long…



I patted myself down and found that all my tools were still on my belt: the wire, the gun, and the gloves.



The idea of dropping my gun was akin to cutting off my hand. I didn’t feel right without it. And the wire was compact enough that I could easily just keep it in the waistband of my briefs. The gloves, however, had to go. I released them into the darkness, followed by my shoes, my socks, and my pants. There I was, treading water in my underwear with a gun in my hand, like an Alcatraz escapee. 



That’s when I felt something brush my bare foot.



It felt like the playful tickle of a finger.



I kicked out instinctively, and when I did I made contact with something. It was smooth and squishy like… well, like human skin. 



Like someone was swimming beneath me.



“What the fuck?” I screamed, my words still a useless rattle in my head. My entire body pulled up like I was trying to fold in on myself. “Get the fuck away!”



I pointed the gun down into the water in panic and pulled the trigger. I barely heard the gunshot; it sounded like a balloon popping fifty feet over my roof. I felt the pressure change as the bullet whizzed past my leg, and I realized in a split second that I had been inches away from shooting off my own foot. I hadn’t planned on shooting. Frankly, I was surprised the gun still fired after so long in the water. It was completely instinctual. So, when the recoil flashed up my arm, it slipped right out of my hands.



“No, no, no!”



I reached down desperately to catch it. I got a finger across the barrel, still hot from the gunshot, but it bounced right off and dropped like a stone down through the dark waters into the deep. Just like that, my gun was gone.



“Fuck me!” I cried. 



I had no idea if I had hit anything, but considering it was a literal shot in the dark, the odds weren’t in my favor. More than likely, the thing (I didn’t want to entertain the idea that it was a human being) was still somewhere below the surface of the water. Hell, it could be right in front of me, staring into my eyes silently, watching me, and I would’ve had no idea; that was how complete the darkness was. The idea was enough to turn my stomach.



For a moment I imagined I could hear it breathing beside me, but I quickly shook the illusion. I took a few deep breaths of my own and composed myself.



That must be the “it” my target was referring to as she left. I guess it found me.



There was nothing I could do about that. If this thing was trying to kill me, it could have done that a long time ago. Not to mention, if this thing was lethal, why would that woman choose to swim with it every week?



If it was still here, I just wished it wouldn’t touch me again. That was a wish that I’m pretty sure didn’t come true.



I kept swimming. 



It didn’t take long before I saw the lights.



Between strokes, I picked up a faint glow in the distance.



My heart leapt. The door? Had I swam all this time, for what felt like hours now, and finally reached the exit? *Just keep swimming* was all she told me, and I did what she said.



But… this wasn’t a single point of light. The shape was all wrong, nothing like an open door, and the color was off too. It looked like the residual blue on the horizon after the sunset; like a soft brushstroke laid along the surface of the waters ahead.



I began to swim faster. Whatever it was, it was better than darkness. My body was beginning to ache, the skin on my extremities was completely pruned, and I was feeling nauseous from all the salt water I’d accidentally drank. The worst part, though, was that the water was getting colder. It felt like I had swam out of the shallows on a summer coast and into the middle of the Pacific. My energy was almost depleted. I had to get out of the water.



As I approached, I thought about Virgo’s. The idea of a nice hot burnt cup of coffee sounded like a dream. When I got home, I was going to give Mike the biggest hug. (And I did, too. He hated it almost as much as I did)



The closer I got to the light, the more vast it seemed. I think it was moving towards me, too, because before I even realized it, the light had begun to envelop me. All around was a sea of little blue points of light, like phosphorescent jellyfish, or algae, or something. It was like swimming in stars. 



I’m not a whimsical person. But this was… wonderful. For a brief moment, I forgot how tired I was, and the dull ache of my muscles muted to a distant buzz. I scooped out a handful of water. I had one of them in my hand. It was alive, I think, because it drifted from one end of my hand-pool to the other, then back again; not really swimming, but floating with intention. What a cool creature. My curiosity satisfied, I poured it back into the water to be with its friends again.



As I did, I saw the outline of my hand against the glowing water. I could *see* something. I hadn’t even registered that fact until that moment.



I looked down into the water and saw my legs kicking among the blue spots.I saw the pattern on my underwear. I saw the hair on my shirtless chest. After hours of being in complete and total darkness, without even the ability to cross my eyes and see my nose, I could actually see *myself* again. Trumpets sounded. The Heavens rejoiced. I was over the fucking moon.



It occurred to me, in my euphoria, that maybe the blue creatures marked the beginning of a different zone of this place. If there was light now, then maybe there would be sound again, too. Dare I dream?



“Hello?” I said tentatively. The words didn’t dribble from my lips; they sounded out across the waters. Beyond the vibrations in my head, I could actually hear myself again, too.



I realized then that up until that point, I had already mentally forfeited my life to the darkness. Though I kept swimming, hope had quietly packed up and left me. Eventually, the creature below would pull me down to join it, or I would follow my clothes and sink down to the unknown depths of this cursed fucking pool.



But, with my senses returned, I found a second wind. I had to get the hell out of this place.



“AHHHHHH!” I shouted. I don’t really want to admit how long I made senseless, barbaric noises, just savoring the sound of my own voice.



“I’m coming home, bitch! I’m coming!”



I spun around in the expanse of blue light.



That’s when I heard a *snap*. Not like a branch cracking; like fingers.



I stopped spinning. There was something a few feet away from me in the water, sticking straight up like a tree branch.



As my eyes focused, my smile eroded from my face in an instant.



It was a human hand. And it was waving.



I recoiled, screaming. I splashed violently at the water in an attempt to move away from it. This was the creature–the hand that had grazed my foot. God only knew what the rest of it looked like beneath the water, but I had a hard time imagining it was human. 



The hand didn’t chase me. It stopped waving and did another gesture: it laid its palm flat and moved the hand down towards the water. I understood it. *Hush*, it was saying, like a teacher at an assembly lowering the kids’ volume level.



I stopped moving away. I stared at the hand, my brow furrowed, panting. Any moment it would lurch forward to drown me. Any… moment…



Instead, it gestured again: it pointed one long index finger directly at me (*You!,* it said) and then beckoned me, folding its fingers into its palm repeatedly (*Come here*).



“No, no, stay the fuck away from me,” I said. I had no idea if the thing could understand me, but I said it anyways. “Don’t touch me.”



The hand gave me a thumbs up. *Okay, I won’t*.



I was still scared to death of the thing. I don’t know if it was a trick of the light or not, but it seemed like it was floating closer and closer to me. I would swim back, subtly, and it would close the gap. It wanted to be near me. Horrifying.



It did several more gestures, but at the time, I had no idea what it was trying to tell me. First, it bounced its palm against the water, skimming. *A wave?* I thought. I hadn’t seen a single wave since I had started swimming. It was a pool, after all.



Next, with a flat hand, it plunged in the water, and stayed for a moment. *Dive*? *Hide*? I wasn’t sure. 



Then, it made its index and ring fingers into legs and ran with them along the water, away from me. *Run*, or *run away*, perhaps, but I wasn’t following. From what? From a wave? From it? It occurred to me that this could just be some twisted game the creature liked to play. Tantalus-style torture, maybe, just like the kind I thought my client might be enacting against the woman. Now, though, I understood why my client wanted me to get her before she touched the water. It was a portal of some kind, to the domain of this strange creature. And I couldn’t shake the feeling that no matter what it communicated, it was trying to hurt me, somehow.



Finally, it pointed at me again, this time with the thumb up like a finger gun, and then brought the hammer down. *Bang*.



Was it referring to when I shot at it earlier?



“I don’t know what you’re trying to say,” I said, frustrated. “Can… can you understand me?” The idea that it could understand my words made me deeply uncomfortable. It had no ears, and a human wouldn’t be able to hear me underwater. But if it could, then perhaps it could tell me how to get out of this place.



The hand gave a thumbs up.



I wasn’t sure what to make of that. I chose to stop worrying. I was powerless. If the hand, whatever it was, wanted to hurt me, there was nothing I could do about that. But, on the off chance it wanted to help me, I needed to stop being so damn scared and communicate with the thing.



“How do I get out of here?” I asked softly.



The hand didn’t move for a while.



“Listen, I’m sorry I shot at you, I didn’t mean to, I swear to God,” I said, “but you gotta help me out, here. I’m tired, and I need to get out of the water.”



The hand still didn’t move.



“Alright, you know what…” I began, but just then, I started to hear a noise.



*hmmmmmmmmmm*



It was coming from behind me. I turned around to see a shape moving along the water in my direction. A boat?



I looked back at the hand with a smile on my face. It was gesturing wildly. *Wave* (?), *hide, run away*, *bang*.



I grew tired of the creature’s game. 



*HMMMMMMMMMMM*



The shadow of the boat grew larger as it approached; I saw a kerosene lamp on board, and by its light I could make out the figure of a man waving his arm over his head. Help had arrived. 



“Over here!” I cried. I began to swim towards the boat.



Suddenly, the hand was in front of me. *Hush*, it gestured. *Run.*



Emboldened by the prospect of freedom, I swam right past it. It didn’t reach out to touch me, just like it said it wouldn’t.



I began to have doubts. Was the hand truly trying to help me after all?



No, no. I remembered its little trick underwater with my foot that nearly caused me to shoot my toes off, and its silence when I asked for help. The person on the boat was a man; the thing in the water wasn’t. Even if this guy wasn’t of the purest intention, he still had a boat. Worst case scenario, I would commandeer it. I still had the length of wire. In any case, it beat being in the water with this… thing.



“I’m here!” I cried through a mouthful of salt water. The paddling was more than my body could handle. My swimming slowed to a crawl. God, I remember how cold I felt just then, chilled down to the bone. I don’t think I could have lasted another ten minutes in that water.



I heard a splash.



Underlit by the blue light, like the woman’s face, I saw a life preserver bobbing in the ripples.



“I see you, buddy!” the man called from the boat. He had a soothing, confident voice, like he wasn’t worried at all.



With my last vestiges of strength, I swam in long strokes towards the disc, quickly closing the distance.



Just as the ends of my fingers touched the rope laced around the edges of the preserver, the hand appeared again. It gripped the preserver, and began to drag it away from my reach.



“No!” I shouted helplessly. I tried to follow after it, but I was moving at a snail’s pace now, my head thundering, my chest heaving up and down, each breath draining traces of salt water into my lungs and stomach. I was starting to drown. It was much more subtle than they make it seem in movies.



“I don’t think so, you little bastard!” the man hollered, and then came the blast of a shotgun. Reflexively I ducked my head underwater. Thousands of the little blue creatures drifted around me in that peaceful moment. I looked down at my body. I was still intact–not a single hole in me, and no pain.



I popped my head above the surface and saw that the hand was gone.



The life preserver, though, was still too far for me to reach.



My head dipped back underwater again, this time without my permission. But I was powerless to fight it. I was beginning to sink.



A peace fell over me. All the glowing creatures around me seemed to close in, and then dim, slowly, slowly, until it was as dark as before they arrived. Perhaps I would find out how deep the pool went, after all. Frankly, it was a better ending than I deserved. So of course, I didn’t get it.



I felt a hand grab mine.



When I awoke, I was aboard the boat. I was wearing several layers of clothing now, dry clothing, and I could see by the glow of the lamp that the boat’s captain was seated across from me, reloading his shotgun and looking anxiously at me as I stirred.



“Oh, thank god,” he gasped. “ I thought I did all that mouth-to-mouth for nothing.” Then he laughed, a hearty belly laugh.



I sat up slowly. My head was still pounding, and I was shaking from the cold, but I could feel the tingle of my nerves in my extremities, and I knew that I would be okay after a while.



“Thank you,” I managed. I coughed. My throat was sore from the salt water. That was weird to me. Growing up, my mom would make me gargle salt water to *treat* a sore throat. I guess there’s a big difference between gargling and drinking.



“Listen, try to stay close to the lamp, alright?” he said. I nodded and shuffled closer to it.



There was a sizzling sound. Through the lamplight I could see that the captain had a small gas stove set up in the corner, and he was frying something up in a mini cast iron pan.



“I got some fish in the cooler I’m about to fry up, if you want some,” he offered. “This here is for me though. Appetizer.”



Whatever it was, it smelled delicious. Eating hadn’t even crossed my mind in the water, but I realized then that I was absolutely starving. It felt like an eternity ago that I had walked down the employee hallway and placed by hand against the mysterious black door.



The captain poured what looked like a handful’s worth of nuts into a bowl and blew on them to cool.



“Well, I’m glad I came by when I did,” he said. “That thing in the water…”



“I’m glad, t-too,” I stuttered. "I was… al-almost dead.”



“I know, man, you were bluer than the algae when I pulled you up,” he laughed. I managed a smile, but I didn’t really want to think about it. I was warm now, at least.



“Listen, I know you probably just want to rest but, I gotta ask: how the hell did you end up all the way out here?”



“Long story,” I said simply.



“We got time,” he said. "It's a good trip."



“Where are we going?”



“Welp… that’s up to you, I guess. I was headed north, up to the coast, but I suppose if you wanted me to, I could take you south, back home.” He didn’t sound thrilled about the idea, but I nearly leapt out of my seat. I would’ve, too, if it wasn’t for a throbbing pain in my foot when I put pressure on it.



“Could you really? I-I’m dying to get out of here, man. Please.” I sounded more desperate than I wanted, but it was hard to contain it. 



“You got it, brotha,” he said, and with a swift maneuver of the on-board engine, he turned the boat around and started us on our way.



I felt the wind blowing through my hair as we cut through the darkness. The boat bounced up and down, slapping against the water in a rhythmic hum. I remembered the hand’s first obtuse gesture, the *wave*, and I suddenly understood it: *boat*. The message finally clicked. 



*Hide and run from the boat, he has a gun*.



Clearly, that was a warning only the creature needed to heed. If the hand had its way, I would be drowned by now. I looked over the sides of the boat to see if I could make out any figures following us in the glowing blue water, but I couldn’t. *Good riddance*, I thought.



The nuts had apparently cooled, so the captain took them in his hand and threw one back with a loud *CRUNCH*.



My stomach grumbled. My foot ached, a little more than everything else. I must’ve hit it on something when the captain pulled me into the boat. I couldn’t be mad at the guy.



“You think you could manage that story, now?” he asked me, an eyebrow raised.



So I told him. I told him everything I told you all in my first post, about the job, the woman, the room. He just listened quietly, nodding along. 



“So, you were going to kill that blonde woman, huh?” he asked.



I didn’t know he knew her. I figured she was as much of an interloper in this weird place as I was.



“Yeah. That’s my job where I’m from,” I said, hoping he wouldn’t take it personally.



“I wish you woulda killed her,” he grumbled.



That was interesting. Not only did he know her, but he wanted her dead, too.



“I tried,” I said. “I didn’t expect… this.”



I looked overboard and saw that the algae had dispersed, and the water was once again dark. The lamp was the only light.



“I’ve been trying too, man.”



“To… kill? That woman?”



“Oh yeah. I’m out here hunting for her constantly. But that fucking hand… they communicate with each other. It’s like they’re friends or something. Every time I think I found her, she disappears.” He sighed and threw back another nut with a *CRUNCH,* even louder this time.



“Why?” I asked.



“Why does the hand help her, or why am I trying to kill her?”



“Both, I guess.”



“She helped the hand, and now it helps her. That’s all I know, really. As far as my hunting her… it’s complicated,” he said with a shrug.



“We got time,” I reminded him. He smiled.



“Not much more. We’re just about here,” he said. “All you really need to know is that they put me here to protect the island, and she’s a threat. Simple as.”



He turned off the engine. We slowed down to a stop in the water.



“Are we here?” I asked.



“Almost,” he said thoughtfully. “You know something, man?”



I looked around at the darkness, hoping to find the light of the doorway somewhere in it. Why did we stop short? Did he really know where the exit was exactly, or would I have to find it myself? As long as I didn’t have to get back in the water…



“What’s that?” I replied absently.



“It’s just us out here,” he said. “In all this dark.”



I looked at him. He was just sitting there looking back. I took him in for the first time: he had broad shoulders, 5’o’clock shadow, and a dark coat on. His hand was still cupped holding the roasted nuts, and he threw another back. He looked like anyone else back home; like any guy on the street.



I also noticed that the gun he had been cleaning before was now resting casually on his knee, pointed straight at me.



“Is it really? Aren’t there other people in this place?” I asked, as calmly as possible.



“Maybe. But for now, out here… it’s just us. You know something else?”



“What?”



“I could do anything I want to you right now, and no one could stop me.”



I didn’t move. I focused on keeping my breath even. I just smiled at him politely.



“Like what?” I asked.



“*Anything*. Don’t you listen?” he said. He was talking just like before, no change in his tone. Just like any guy on the street.



“Take off your sock,” he demanded quietly.



“Why?”



“Because I asked you to.”



“Which one?”



“The one that’s been hurting you.”



I reached down cautiously to my left foot and peeled off the sock he had placed over it while I had been asleep.



Beneath, it was a mess of blood. The clumsy remains of my toes were wrapped in seeping red bandages. As I realized the extent of the injury, the pain came rushing in. My entire leg throbbed.



The captain threw back another “nut” with an even louder ***CRUNCH***.



He laughed, a deep belly laugh. “Isn’t that a great moment?” he said. He extended the last toe to me. “Here, I saved the big one for you.” He laughed again.



I laughed too. I didn’t know what else to do. 



“Why?” I asked. I couldn’t understand. 



I had no desire to scream. I wasn’t really all that afraid, even; just like in the water, my body had accepted that I was going to die. In my line of work, every job is a chance at death, so life doesn’t mean so much. All I really wanted to understand was why this was happening–why wouldn't he let me go home?



“They used to let me eat the escapees, but not anymore. I still got a taste for it. Consider it your toll,” he said casually.



“No, you fucking monster,” I growled, “why can’t I leave?”



“Oh, that. Well, here’s the deal: I don’t protect the island by keeping people out,” the captain said. “I keep ‘em in.”



I set my foot back down on the ground. It flashed with pain as the bandages made contact with the wood.



“Look real close,” he said. “See, way out there?”



I looked out in the distance. At first, I saw nothing. But after a few moments, I started to make out a light against the darkness–just a small pinpoint of yellow.



“That’s the Island. I figured I’d give you just a glimpse. That’s where your blonde friend’s from. She escaped a long time ago. And now, she keeps coming back to help others escape, too.”



“Why-” I began, fighting down a wave of pain, “-don’t you just let me go to the Island?”



“What, so I can have another blonde bitch clone to give me trouble? Listen, if you’d have killed her, I would’ve let you go to the island toll free–hell, I might’ve even let you leave–but you didn’t,” he said. “ So now, it’s time to tie up loose ends.”



I squinted as he brought the shotgun up out of his lap and leveled it at me.



Then I heard a clatter.



I glanced down. It was my gun.



The captain and I looked overboard simultaneously.



There was the hand, poking out of the water. I could barely see it by the lamplight.



It pointed a finger gun at the captain and dropped the hammer. *Bang*. Then it was gone.



I had the hand’s message all wrong. It was the same message it probably told the blonde woman as she swam away from the island: *If the boat comes: hide, run, and when all else fails… Bang*.



The captain and I both looked down at the gun again. Then I sprang for it.



I had it in my hand when I felt a peppering of buckshot in my right shoulder.



The blast was deafening. Weak and disoriented already, my head swam and my ears rang at the sound.



The kerosene lamp fell. I heard it shatter on the ground as the boat descended into darkness.



I switched the pistol to my left hand. I had no idea where the captain was, nor if the pistol would fire a second time, but I pulled the trigger anyway.



Another blind shot.



*Bang.*



I knew he was dead when I heard the splatter of his brain on the hull.



All was quiet for a long moment. I lowered my pistol to my side, placing it in my jacket pocket. It was hard to believe I almost didn’t take it along with me.



But then, I heard a horrible wail. It was a long, wretched cry of mourning.



It was coming from the Island.



Immediately, I heard something approaching quickly from my left.



It started as a low grumble, and slowly swelled into a thunderous roar.



I ducked down, holding tightly to the rib of the boat. It was a wave. I could feel the waters shifting beneath me long before it arrived.



The water folded on top of me with unimaginable force. The small boat didn’t stand a chance–I was torn free and tossed helplessly through the black waters. Everything was a swirl of motion. I reared up out of the water to catch my breath, only to be beaten back under by another wave, and another, until I was certain that I would never surface again. 



In the tumult, I caught glimpses of the pinpoint of yellow light growing brighter and brighter, until it was like the sun shining down on me.



I’m certain that at some point I felt a hand tugging on my collar, but at what point, and whose, I couldn’t possibly say.



When I awoke, I was lying on the sandy shores of the Island.
