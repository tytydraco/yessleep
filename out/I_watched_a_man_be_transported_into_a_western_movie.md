 Hey, **Ì̶͓͂ͅ** don't know how to approach this subject. Something insane happened and I can't explain it but I can go by what I went through and what I've experienced in hopes̸̲̤̊͊ that someone out there̷̓ͅ can make he̷̓ͅads or tails of this.

It was a week ago, I was walking home from work around 11 pm while listening to mŷ̵͕ music. I have wireless earbuds so I leave one open in case a car is coming. O̶̭̤̮͍̓̑̈́n my way home I heard someone laughing in the distance that kept getting louder and louder. I thou̵͇̳͌̽̚͜ght nothing of it at first. "Maybe someone's window is open?" I thought to myself shaking it off. About halfway home I hear̸̬̖̂ thè̴̙͖͜ la̸̡̧̾̈́́͘ughing still despite being a clear mile from where I first heard̸̯̜̩̿ thẽ̵̯̫̝̣ eerie laughter.

"Is this weiṛ̵͋̀͝do following me?" Ï̷̛͖̰ take my earphone out of my head and took a quick turn to look toward the source of the noise when I noticed a ma̸͇͛̿n standing directly under the street light and looking into the sky. He seemed to have noticed I saw him̷͖̒ and st̶͇̃̒opped laughing. "H̴̝̏͝ey man, Are you ok?" I yelled with a slightly agitated voice. He stood there in deafening silence with the only thing breaking it was the quiet drizzle̵̼̔. After what seemed like a few minutes he began to laugh quietly and move towar̵̠̼̚d me.

His body was ė̸̬͓rratic and awkward. His head still pointed to the sky, concealing his face. Something about his strange moṽ̷̺͗ements and awkward, off-be̷̛̪͌at laughing sent chills up my spin̷͇̹̐e and caused my flight or fight response to go into overdrive. Without thinking my body broke into a full sprint home. I never ran so fà̶̛͈st in my life! My heart was racing an̴̯̼͑d all my senses were height̶̗̻̊ened. The slight scent of petrichor was in the air but that was quickly overcome with the overwhelming scent of rusty iron.

Before I knew it the man caught up and was within a few feet of me I could hear his laughing grow louder and more maniacal. I could feel his anger as I quickly turned my head to take a look at how close he was. His arms were outstretched and his face was still looking into the sky but I could see the contorteḍ̶̇́ smile that stretched inhumanly ear to ear. I ran intǫ̴̾ someone's yard with fresh mud and wet grass. I almost slipped but caught my balance and corrected my footing. I heard a loud thud and a crack. I looked back to see the man has fallen̸͓͇͛̆ onto the groundbreaking one of his arms so bad a bone was sticking out the side and blood quickly pō̸̧̺͝oled around him.

But he kept̴͔̅ smiling and laughing as if the pain didn't exist. I stopped for a moment but realized he was staring at me and no longer looking into the sky. His f̷̖̎̌ace was distorted into a smiling rage as he stood quickly up and snapped his arm back into place. I kept running after gaining a large distance and nearing my home. When I got to my house I flung the door open and locked the door dë̷̟̝́adbolt and ran to my room and locked it as well. My dog noticed my fear and his hair sta̴͍̐̋rted to raise straight up.

"Shhh, it's ok boy. Don't make any noise." I petted my dog attempting to calm him a little. As I sat ther̴͓͈̿e I checked my pockets for m̷̜̯̀y phone and it wasn't in there. I looke̵̲͑d around the room and didn't see it. I quietly opened my bedroom door and saw my phone across the hall on the floor so I crept up to it as quietly as I could and grabbed it. " I need to call the police right now," I̶̧̤͊ said to myself under my brea̸̱̒̇th.

Khorne (m̵͙̉̓y dog) was at the front door growling at it. I looked back to see this guy smiling th̶̺̻̕rough the window of my door. He starte̸͉̳̓͐d to headbutt the door̴̖̺̎̐ causing Khorne to get more agitate̸͓̹̓͌d. Event̸̗̗̿ually, he broke the window on the door and reached intő̴͕̫ it trying to unlock the door. I ran back into my room but I could hear Khorne biting the man's̵̗̽ arm but he kept lâ̷̩ͅughing. I could hear the ripping of muscle and flesh. I started to dial 911 when I heard the door fling open and my dog barking loudly.

The phone wasn't even able to call the number and said the serv̵͕̿͆ice was out although I had full bars. I kept trying over and ove̶̤͐̏r until I heard the gruesome sound of my dog whimpering as the laughing man tore into him. The cry̷̯͐̐ing of my poor dog was silenced with a sickening thud and a loud squelching sound of wet meat. Blood began to pool into my rŏ̸͎om. The smiling man started to pound on my door and laugh even louder. He started to hit the door so hard that the door was cracking and the hinges were being bent.

I ran to my window and tried to force it open as the man was breaking into the room. As I got the window open and stepped out the man busted into the room and ran toward the window. It was then the light on my tv turned on and western music started to play. The smile on the man's face tu̷̩͖͆rned to fear as he turned to face the screen. I was entranced as the screen played an old western movie.

The movie cut to a cowboy who was concealing his face with a scarf but his eyes were glowing red. He was standing in the middle of a town with the clock ticking to noon. The town's bells were ringing and on the 12th ring, he looked at the camera and said "I'm here for you Indrid Cold. Get out here and face justice." It was then the smiling man tried to crawl out of the window I did but not trying to get to me but to get away from the tv. I saw his face... I have never seen such primal fear as he tried to escape. Before he could get out of the window a large dark red claw grabbed his leg and quickly dragged him into the tv.

On the screen, Indrid stood there in a leather duster and the smile on his face was more of a frown. "Draw your weapon, you yellow-bellied bastard." Indrid fumbled and shakingly grabbed the iron revolver from his hip and pointed it slowly at the strange cowboy. The camera panned to the cowboy's eyes. They were sharp with killing intent. I felt no evil or malice in this man but instead, I felt. hopeful as if he was the main character in my life protecting me and others from this being... this Indrid Cold. The town bells stopped ringing and with the blink of an eye the sound of gunfire filled the quiet town and Indrid fell to the ground. The Cowboy stood victorious and the town and even I cheered.

The cowboy looked to the screen and tilted his hat before grabbing Indrid's lifeless body and placing it on the horse. The credits started to roll and my name was on there as "The citizen in trouble". There was also

(The smiling man:̸͓͎̒̐-----Indrid Cold)

(Dog:-----Khorne)

(Hero:----The Revenant)̴̟͙̃͘

After the credits rolled I saw the words "The end" and The Revenant spoke up. "We will meet again. I see you behind the screen reading this and knowing what I am. Safe travels out there" I have a feeling he was speaking to me but also not. I don't know what to do as the screen shut off the blood on my floor was gone and my dog was alive. The damage to my door was repaired however the footprints of the smiling man were still on my floor. This happened I know it. I don't wear shoes with the pattern that was on my floor. Who was The Revenant speaking to?

Anyways, I went to sleep that night hoping that this will be the last I have seen of the smiling man and even the revenant but something deep down is telling me it isn't over yet. Everything seems off-color to me. Like it's grainy and dry. I don't know how else to describe it other than as if I am stuck in that western movie despite never even entering it. I see his eyes sometimes when I look at the TV screen. What does it want with me and why does it feel like they aren't staring at me but beyond me...As if he's staring at you...
