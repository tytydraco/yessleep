I don't really want to get into what landed me under house arrest, it's not relevant for now and I don't want anybody I know to work out I've posted this, they'll think I've cracked again.

Regardless, under house arrest I am, and I live alone. 

My house is in Lancashire, England, and it was once a national heritage building (it's fucking massive). Our 'garden' is nearly an acre, all of which I'm permitted to access under the terms of my arrest. The weather has been pretty nice since I've been trapped here and so I've been spending a lot of time on the sun loungers drinking pimms. 

I'm sure you're thinking it's strange that I live alone, and it is. My parents died when I was young, and I no longer have any siblings, they're gone. 

My upbringing revolved around this house, playing in the garden with my mum and hosting large lavish parties that would go on all night. Our guests were famous and wealthy I suppose, but they tended to wear masks so I couldn't name you any. I used to love those parties, even though I was only about 9 or 10, they let me stay up the entire time, I was always so exhausted that I couldn't ever remember going to bed, I'd just wake up tucked in, often in random rooms around the house.

Since my parents died, I've pretty much just been living here anyway, my arrest is almost a welcome excuse to be a hermit. 

My (relevant) problems started a few days ago. 

I was having a wander around the garden, reminiscing about playing hide and seek with my mum through the bushes and trees.

All of a sudden, I felt a huge gust of wind, it almost knocked me over. It was immediately followed by giggling, like a little girl had just played a prank on me. I turned around but all I saw were the trees and bushes. The hair on my arms stood up, and I remembered. 

I remembered the little girls at the bottom of the garden as one occasionally remembers a visit to their grandparents when they were a kid, or how they felt when their parents had an argument. The memories of playing with their wings, and running around trying to catch them, came flooding through. 

It's where I used to go when I was sad, when I couldn't sleep, when dad had fallen asleep in the middle of a sentence. 

They were as much home to me as a child as the house, and here I was now, they're still here, now I need them most. 

I caught a glimpse of an emerald green eye, camouflage against the shrubbery, but unmistakable in it's piercing ethereal quality. She darted back, giggling and fluttering her papery wings. 

When I rounded the corner, everything changed again. 

There she was, one of the girls, still a child but now looking up at a lanky thirty year old man with an ankle monitor on and greasy unkempt hair. She looked disgusted, utterly revolted at my having aged. Without moving her lips, she'd told me she despised me. 

She fluttered, and disappeared into the sky. 

Then last night, I was in bed in one of the third floor bedrooms (I pick a new one each night, there's repeats but I never remember) when I heard the window rattle. We ran out of money a long time ago you see, the house is falling apart, so the window must've been next to go. 

I got out of bed, the flashing red light on my ankle monitor lighting the way, when I heard the gentle waft of wings. They were close, it felt like someone was blowing on the nape of my neck. 

When I turned around, there was nothing but the most natural, earthy smell imaginable. Imagine every natural smell rolled into one, that smell before it rains, freshly cut grass, fruit and veg etc. 

I went to the window, drew back the curtains, and there she was. Hovering inches from my face, just the flimsy glass between us. She was crying, and she looked older than she did the day before, she started to fade away, but placed her long skeletal fingers on the glass. 

I was terrified. Not of her, but of the idea she was fading, I need her. 

I'm going to sleep at the bottom of the garden tonight.
