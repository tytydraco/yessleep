We just got back from school, we were tired, we decided to hangout with a few friends, do things you may not do (that kind of things). We had a battery of someones vape, and me and my friend decided to throw it in the lake to see if it will explode. We were just waiting for five minutes. And we saw a black   entrace. It looked like a sewer, but there wasn't any water in there, so we thought what it possibly can be. I thought of a catacomb under the whole city, but we decided to check it out.

I first was scared though, i thought there was somebody in there so i decided to yello HELLO in that thing to make sure nobody says something back. So we stepped in, it was cold and dirty. We decided after 2 minutes, to go back. Because we were scared. And there was something strange happening. We saw a shutter and we decided to lift it. But it was too heavy.

Then something weird happend. Every person around us was gone. Even the fishers were gone. I couldn't think of something normally this was weird, so then we decided to get home. At home some things were different, like small things. It was weird. The windows were different too, there was some plastic thing on it but it didn't look good.

There also was a big fittness bicycle in his room, it was never there. When he tried it, it gave him an electric schock. I rid home, there were trees i never saw there was water that was never there. The things where just different. Later my stepdad was angry at me because i was ten minutes late, he never gets angry, NEVER. I wasn't hungry, i didn't ate i think i escaped the mortal dimension. Or this is just a different one. But it was weird. It was so weird that i thought this was a prank.

My parents later did normal like always but something was still weird about it. We watched a movie and i got to bed early. I wasn't heading to sleep and I texted my friend. We talked about it, he said we should go there another time. 

My friend felt dizzy, me too. I had an burning headache. He too. We called, because we where scared. While im typing this i feel dizzy. and feel weird. They arent human, somethings bad is going to happen. I hear something by my window and I cannot explain this all. But remember me and never, i say NEVER go into that thing. Tommorow we are going back to show it to a few friends. And they will never forget it. I think they are here to come and get me. And i will fight back. Its scary now. I was wrong. Im now texting my friend hes scared. He hears noise around his window. Me too. Help me until its too late. Remember me. Bye
