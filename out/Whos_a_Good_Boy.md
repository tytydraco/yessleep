Dellany couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen a dog; not since all this zombie apocalypse stuff started, anyway. As far as he knew, the undead didn’t eat animals. They were strict peoplevores; fresh, living humans only, but in all the chaos of the outbreak, most animals had made themselves scarce. Sure, there was still a squirrel or two running around the city, and plenty of birds, but it had been months since Dellany had seen a dog.

This one had light grey fur with black speckles, the color of cookies and cream, and looked like some sort of herding dog, an Australian Shepherd or something like that. Six inches of frayed, green leash hung from its collar. The dog stood on the sidewalk in front of a coffee shop, its windows smashed out, tables and chairs inside stained with dried blood.

“Hey, there,” he whispered, crouching and holding out his hand. “Who’s a good boy?”

The dog cocked its head.

Dellany slipped off his rucksack, fishing out some jerky that he had scrounged from an abandoned gas station down the street. He tore off a piece and tossed it to the dog, who gave it a quick sniff and gobbled it down.

“Who’s a good boy, huh?”

The dog turned and trotted a few yards away, stopping to regard Dellany with ice blue eyes.

“Hey, where ya going?” he cooed, creeping slowly, so as not to spook the animal.

The dog scurried further up the sidewalk. It paused for a backwards glance, before disappearing into an alley. Dellany followed. He’d never been much of an animal lover, but these last few months had been so lonely. It would be good to have a friend.

At the far end of the alley, the dog sat, tail swishing on the pavement. Dellany approached slowly, tearing off another piece of jerky. He had gotten within ten feet of the dog, whispering soothing words and assurances, when it started barking.

“No, no, no! Don’t do that!” Dellany hissed, waving his hands.

The undead couldn’t see very well. Their eyes gummed up with dirt because they never blinked. They didn’t breathe, either, so no sense of smell, but they could hear just fine. They could hear your stomach growling with hunger from a block away; Dellany knew that from personal experience. He decided he didn’t really need a friend after all. Turning to run, he found himself face to face with a zombie.

She wrapped her rotting arms around him, sinking her dirty, broken teeth into his neck, before he could react. Dellany broke free of her embrace, stumbling backward against the wall, clapping a hand to his wound. Blood squirted between his fingers and washed down the front of his shirt in waves. She’d bitten through his carotid artery. The strength went out of legs and he slid to the ground. As she dropped down to bite into his calf, Dellany noticed the other end of the frayed green leash, still looped around her decaying wrist. The dog watched her with adoring eyes.

Yeah, you’re a good boy, Dellany thought, just before the world went dark. Still loyal to your human, even though she wasn’t really human anymore.
