I've been a horror fan since I can remember. My brother and I used to binged watch 90's and 2000's horrors and slashers film everynight. But this didn't prepare me from the shit that's been happening lately. 

This first started when we moved here 2 weeks ago—in a secluded town near the Appalachian. Far north than I can remember. My father got promoted to supervise a nearby mine, so we had no choice but to relocate to this town. At first it was ok, the locals are not that far from your average citizen. They were quite friendly, almost too friendly to my brother's liking. Who's usually judged and criticize for his choice of dark clothings

So when his clothes started going missing from the clothing rack in our backyard. We initially thought it was the wind, until we saw his black Metallica printed socks being worn by our classmate who's also living next to us. 

Being the confrontational twin, my brother demanded that he give it back. Fortunately, the two didn't broke into a fight and the other just gave his socks willingly. 

I thought that, that was the end of it. 

Until last week, my mother's blazer went missing. 
I'm not usually quick to assume things. But from the fiasco that happened last week. I know that I have to tell her what happened. But she disregard it, telling me that she might have misplaced it like she usually did to some of her belongings. 

My brother and I stop pushing her to it. She always wanted to make a good impression to the people around her, and the last thing she wanted is to point a finger to someone she barely know. 

So we let it happened. The next thing we knew, her dress was gone, her jacket missing, and even her shoes that she safely tuck in our shoe cabinet inside our house was gone missing as well. 

My mother's concern finally went to our father. And we report it to the police the next day, they made a search to their house and didn't find anything.

My brother and I were grounded after that. Especially my twin, who was adamant to help with the search. 


Now that our neighbors knew what happened. We kept a low profile for a while. Disregarding the stares we've been getting since that day. It's just so weird that we are being scrutinized when we were the ones with the stolen items. 

And just three days ago. When our parents went out and my brother went somewhere with his friends. I was left alone to guard whatever we have in the house. And I made sure that our clothes, shoes, anything that can be stolen is kept safe inside. I dead bolted all the doors and lock the windows to make sure that no one gets in. 

And as the day slowly goes dark, the eerie feeling of being watch keeps getting stronger. I was restless. The TV that has been my only company the whole night was drown out by my thoughts. And I felt completely alone yet can't shake off the feeling that I wasn't. That there's someone with me at the moment. 

My anxiety led me to call my brother, but his phone was out of reach. My parents took the call but disregarded whatever I told them. By the time I ended the call, I was already in my room. Locked from the eerie quiet of what's outside. 

lt didn't take long when I heard something. Like someone was walking with their tippy toe. The soft creek of our wooden floors gave it away but the sound of my heart beating on my chest almost made me missed it. 

This confirms my suspicion 

I peeped through the gap between the floor and my bedroom's door. The light outside the living room remained on, and I can see the vacant room clearly. It remained quiet like there's no one outside but the minty smell coming from somewhere gave it out. 

I know there's someone out there. Like someone is purposely trying to scare me. Whatever this is, this didn't look like a typical break in. They wouldn't have left a trace nor a smell. But the strong coolness of mint left my brain foggy. 

I stood up to barricade the door with a chair when suddenly a voice, came out from the other side. It sounds like my mother. She was asking me to come out. Like she knew that I'm in my room the whole time. I didn't respond. I'm already scared shitless to utter a word. But for some goddamn reason I crouch back to see what's outside. 

And I shouldn't have done it. 

Because from out of the normal; the sofas, the turned off TV and the lamp table besides the television, the only thing that stands out like sore thumb is a foot standing irregularly stiff, a few feet from my door. Wearing the same shoe—my mother was convinced she misplaced. 

She didn't knock nor tried to break in. She just stand there waiting for me to say anything or do anything. And when it already feels like an hour. She took a step forward, but with the tip of her sandals, her heels up. Walking on tippy toes towards my room. 

She called again. Her voice was soft and not threatening. 

This time I used my body along with the chair to barricade what's out there. 

She keeps calling my name as if she knows me. Using the voice, I thought it was my mother. But her's was a bit deeper. Almost an imitation. She didn't bang the door nor force herself in. She just stands there. Waiting for me to do something. 

I remember how sweaty I was despite the cold. And I almost forgot how that night ended. All I knew is my brother found me sleeping next to the chair I used to barricade with. 

He said my room was open before he got back. And I was lying limp with my head on the chair, sleeping soundly. 

If that was a dream. That was the most fuck up shit I've ever experienced. And I won't take it any other than that. 

Still, I can't help but ask myself. Who open the door before my brother or even let himself in.
