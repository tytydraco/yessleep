We were only two hours from town when the storm hit us as if it had been waiting for the perfect moment.



What started as a few droplets quickly turned into a full cloud burst.



I heard Damien yell, “Look, there’s a cabin.”



It was a small, half-collapsed wooden house in the middle of the forest.



A single muddy footprint on the porch, fresh even though the rain had just started.



Damien knocked on the door, and on the second knock, the door opened on its own with a loud screech. 



A cold breeze followed.



We all looked at each other. Damien shrugged his shoulders and walked in.



“I bet it’s abandoned. Worst case, the owner shows up, and we get yelled at for dripping all over their floor.” Damien said, laughing.



“I’d take yelling over being out in that storm,” Steve replied, walking in too.



I was hesitant to walk behind them. Then lightning struck nearby, and I quickly rushed in.



The cabin was small, split into two rooms.



There was a lot of dust around, but besides that, the place was clean.



Mugs and plates stacked neatly on shelves, a closet full of old clothing.



There were beds in both rooms. Made up like someone just left them that way today.



A jar of black liquid was on one of the shelves. Damien took it off and opened it.



The smell was foul. I had to plug my nose.



“I’ll give you five dollars if you drink this,” he said to Steve, who rolled his eyes.



“Maybe don’t open jars with unknown liquids, Damien,” Steve replied.



Some strange bugs crawled on the floor. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen this kind before. 



They were the same dark black as the liquid in the jar, with eight legs and small wings.



Long antennas twitched around as they crawled on the floor. 



Their eyes were unnaturally white, following your every move.



The bugs would scatter into different crevices between the floorboards.



Looking at them gave me a strange feeling of eeriness and unpleasantness, like I could feel their small black bodies crawling under my skin.



Steve found a fireplace in the back of one of the rooms with some old wood around it.



He got the fire going while Damien just sat on the bed eating his food.



“Can you ever help?” Steve asked angrily.



“You seem to have it under control,” Damien replied, laughing.



Steve shook his head and turned back.



They took the room with a fireplace. I don’t get cold, so I didn’t mind taking the other room.



Before falling asleep, I could hear the two laughing. 



It was funny how quickly they would calm down after getting on each other's nerves.



I woke up in the middle of the night to some strange sounds. It took me a second to realise it was Damien speaking in a concerned voice.



When I walked to the next room, I saw Steve lying on the bed, spasming, holding his stomach, letting out faint gasps of pain.



Damien was sitting next to him now, almost yelling: “Steve, Steve, what’s wrong with you. Talk to me.”



I knew something was seriously wrong. Steve never showed his pain.



“What happened to him?” I said.



Damien looked my way quickly, almost as if woken up from a trance.



“I don’t know, man, I woke up to Steven making these weird, choking wet sounds.”



“We need to call for hel…” I didn’t even finish my thought.



Steven fell to the ground. He was now on all fours, heaving like a cat.



I tried to pull my phone out of my pocket, but my hands were trembling.



Steven then started throwing up a strange black fluid on the ground. Hardly visible under the dim light.



The fluid started moving, slithering, inching on the ground. The room didn’t smell of stomach acid, but of a strange, sour, slightly sweet but unpleasant smell. 



The fluid was making tiny clicking, rustling sounds. The movement intensified, and I could feel the wooden floor moving.



I didn’t realize it at first, but Damien yelled out in panic: “It’s fucking bugs!”



It was almost as if his scream woke the fluid from its long-forgotten sleep; it was now glowing with that strange white eye color.



The bugs started running around the floor, hiding in tiny crevices between the wood.



I jumped up and screamed. Trying to step on as many bugs as I could.



Before we knew it, the fluid was all gone, and Steve’s body was lying on the floor motionless.



My legs started to shake. My mind was spinning, and I could feel my head getting lighter.



Damien always tried to seem confident, but when I looked at him, his eyes glowed with fear, and his mouth was trembling. 



Then his eyes flashed with panic, his pupils dilated even more.



He got on all fours and started heaving too. I managed to get the phone out of my pocket, but there was no signal.



The same black liquid came out of his mouth. In the light of the fire, I could see him crying; the fear behind his eyes turned into pure terror.



I don’t think I’ve ever seen Damien cry.



The bugs came out of his mouth, moved around on the ground, and scattered as did the others.



My feet were trembling, my heart was pounding hard. I stood over Damien's body. 



I couldn’t believe it. I tried to move Damien, wake him up, but his eyes stared dully into the ceiling.



Was I going to be next? I knew I had to act.



I ran out into the forest to call for help.



I was falling over roots, slipping on the mud. I kept feeling around in my stomach to see if something moved.



I finally made it to the meadow and called the ambulance. They said they should be here in an hour.



I fell on the grass, crying, shivering in the cold rain.



I saw my friends die most painfully and brutally. 



Edit: I’m starting to hear buzzing in my ears, but can’t see any bugs.



Something’s crawling in my stomach.



The ambulance is 30 minutes away…
