Hello, my name is Dr. Martinez, paranormal activation test #37, I'll be back with the results of my findings

I feel as though something is wrong
Very wrong
They've found me as I have uncovered the hidden 
The answers to our existence as we know or believe it
But there's things
Not people but things the lurk our darkest thoughts
Creatures we believe as terrors and nightmares
Something pulling on the world around us into a darkend abyss of the damned, the lost ones who've failed the journey of self finding and strayed the treacherous path of death in the face of danger
The way out of a tunnel of darkness yet I feel as tho the light I see at the end is not salvation but the enedible death that we so wish to prolong in this place we've grown to love and hate
My mind has been, as I fear, corrupted by the damned, the watchers have lead my mind astray the difference between what is I and what is them the difference in sanity, a soul, empathy and passion they do no have, with every thought my mind begins to break and collapse, what I believe I can not stand, my eyes deceive me in the slightest my memory playing games My sanity screaming for help as these things play tricks and with no treat I feel as tho I may loose myself

Sleep is our captor, keeping us sane from the unknown, I have not slept in weeks, they watch us, they smell and seek us, we are eary of those in the dark we can not see, but sleep is what hides them, I have traveled and explored much of our world beyond comprehension

Our mortal souls bound to this traitorous world we call our safety, creatures in pockets we can not see, our minds prisoner of our bodies to no see what there is all around. They watch us and if you do not believe then do not listen, they take what we forget, socks, keys, shoes, memories, age, spirit, happiness, they are what drain our souls, they cannot sleep so they feed off what we create, they take our lives without us knowing, they are what we fear in the darkest corners of our thoughts

The darkened air my lungs breathe, my mind absorbing the damnation I have created, the unknown being known. I have seen and done to much, they want me. My voice it echos infinitely against the void around me, movement pacing in nothingness my mind may cease to exist if you found my passages. Please send he_........
