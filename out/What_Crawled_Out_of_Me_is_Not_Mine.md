What crawled out of me is not mine.


My first kid, my Melody, was an accident. at least on my part.. Sex education was barebones at the time, doubly so in no man's land (the midwest). I was 15 in 1993 and had just met Rhett, an older guy from Indiana State. I was enamored, he was charming, and now I have a 15 year old daughter at 30 and Rhett could be in Timbuktu for all I care. I went from Junie, artist, drum major, human, tomboy- to Mom. just mom.


I liked being Mom, maybe it was a little teenage rebellion- to rub it into my own mother’s face that it wasn’t that fucking hard to be nice to something so small and helpless. 


Raising Melody was not easy, no matter the point I was trying to prove. I had to drop out of school, cuz she decided to pop out early as shit, and God did she cry. She had lungs on par with a fuckin Opera singer, excuse my french. She was loud and annoying and I loved her with my entire chest.


 Ma helped raise her, to my confusion. I had thought she would kick me out but, Apparently seeing her daughter in the same position she had been in 15 years prior must have tugged on her heart strings. Her frayed, bare heart strings. Didn’t mean she was nice, but she treated Melody alright. The government assistance must have made it easier to swallow.


Mel hardly looked like her father, thank god, taking after my stocky frame and wild red hair. She liked to sprint around like a cat, all fours, just rippin through the house. She’s a little out of her gourd but she’s wicked smart, and has me wrapped all round her finger.


Few years later, I met Charlie.. My car went to shit and he happened to be the only other person on the road at 7 am, offering a lift to the supermarket. He was in construction, having dropped out of school the same as I did. He didn’t offer up why, and I never asked. He didn’t talk much, and I liked that. He was sweet, respected me and Mel, and provided. I think I might have loved him. So,  we got married when Melody was 5, and eventually tried for kids. 


My heart wasn’t in it, not really. It’d been so long with just Mel and I- Charlie was just so introverted that didn’t really change when he moved in. I didn’t want to raise another baby so close to an empty nest. I wanted to be something other than ‘Mom’. Even my fucking husband calls me mom, I don’t think he’s spoken directly to me in years. Only ever “what’s mom thinking for dinner?” to Mel.


You can only deal with so many pressing comments from the man you live with before giving in seems worth it, even if just to shut him the hell up. 


Well, Have you ever had a miscarraige? Have you had 6? Mel was a miracle baby, I guess. but Despite the darkness, the depression that came with losing so many pregnancies- some part of me was relieved. Charlie was starting to give up.


“I am not trying to scare you, June.” My Doctor had told me, clasping our hands together. June, I was stuck on that. She had called me June. I almost forgot she was talking to me. Her hands were clammy and cold, bone and granite carved far too thin. I thought briefly of a Bluebird. Dr. Georgia Maples was a kind woman, nosy and particular, but kind nonetheless. She helped me through my first pregnancy when My mother had refused to speak to me, let alone drive me anywhere.


 Sitting Melody down after she called Georgia ‘MeeMee’- the name my mother had been pushing on the kid, in front of said mother and Doctor, was something I did not want a repeat of. The shared smoke breaks with my mother that followed weren’t much butter. “But I urge you to look into other options, another pregnancy is too much of a risk, too much strain on your body.” she had pressed.


I wish I could have pretended to put up more of a fight.



After many tears shed, a stilted conversation with Charlie, and an ultrasound, a hysterectomy was the outcome. Can’t make a cake without eggs. Eggs being eggs, cake being a baby.



But here I am, 3 months pregnant. I had gone in for the flu and left with the news my fucking Uterous grew back. Tubes and all. Dr. Maples had no answers, the Surgeon had no answers, and the priest canceled the baptism. 


I was already too far along, according to the law, and the baby seemed to be relatively healthy, despite the fact I was supposed to have no reproductive organs. I had no choice but to ride this thing out.


I guess I should have been happy, everyone told me to be happy, but a pervasive dread had coiled around my guts- cold and heavy, and foreign. I felt disconnected from my body as it swelled and twisted to fit.. 


The first trimester was noticeably rougher than with melody. My stomach cramped and roiled at all hours of the day, and I was almost vomiting more than I ate. I had to frequently return to the hospital for intravenous fluids and vitamins and Charlie had silently taken on more and more hours as I had been almost immediately bed ridden, unable to continue at the salon. Vomiting every few minutes meant even leaving the house was off the table.


Oh, There were the usual symptoms along side mutated morning sickness on fucking steroids but it was hard to notice while dry heaving for a month straight. Swollen feet had not bothered me because I could not stand, cravings weren’t an issue as eating was a chore at best. 


Melody would come talk to me during this. She stayed late sometimes, clearing out only when Dr Maples popped in, and filled the space as soon as she left. Mel was in a bit of an angsty teen phase at the time, hair pinned across her forehead in a faux fringe,  the darkest blue eyeshadow I owned smeared messily across her lids, clumpy mascara and nothing else. 


She would drop herself into my bed, shoes on no matter how many times I griped at her about dirt on the duvet. Most of her time was spent tapping away at her phone or furiously scribbling in her sketchbook, chattering in my general direction about anything she could think of. 


I had been dozing during a rant session when she cut herself off. 


“Mel?” I prompted. At the lack of an answer I opened my eyes. Mel was staring down, around my stomach in shock, then horror, and finally landing on disgust. Despite myself I felt a pang of hurt. “What's wrong?” I prompted, trying and failing to sit up several times.  


She gaped like a fish for a solid few moments. I panicked and snapped,


“Mel!” she startled and gripped her pencil, holding her sketchbook in front of her like a shield.


“It moved!” she yelled, ruffled, upset. “Your stomach moved.”


The second Trimester came prematurely, almost 3 weeks earlier than the usual timeline

Dr. Maples was a frequent guest in my house at that point at her insistence, Hooking me up, talking to me, and doing checkups. Everything looked fine, normal, great even! No scarring, baby developing on time, if freaky fast. 


With more Dr. Maples, came less Mel. She did have an after school gig, I reasoned with myself. She was busy. She had a life. She didn’t need to baby her mother, that wasn’t her responsibility. It had nothing to do with me.


I wanted my mom. 


I tried to read, to crochet, to write, all manner of things to keep me occupied, but sitting up for more than a minute was nigh impossible. More often than not, I can't even sit up, just rocking back and forth like a beatle. Daytime television and infomercials most days, or the low chatter of Dr. Maple;s radio, firmly set  to 70’s country or nothing. Soon enough, most I could do was sleep and drift. I opened my eyes to dark, and closed them to dark looking in the same corner.


Occasionally I would open my eyes to a sponge bath, blurry recognition that the water was coming away red. Georgia would pat my forehead dry and murmur quietly, tracing my shin and pinching between my toes until my body gave up again, blissfully unaware.
 

I asked once, only once. 


Waylaid on my side, Georgia gently pressing into the taught skin of my stomach. When the stethoscope finally cut a retreat, I asked.


“Dr. Maples?” I rasped. Georgia barely paused, sharp little fingers scuttling across my stomach, feeling for some secret lump or wrinkle to tell her what she needed to know.


“Junie,” she warned, glancing up over her glasses. Sensible glasses, thin and rectangular. I laughed before I responded, short, like a cough.


“Sorry, sorry- Georgia,” Georgia finally smiled and sat up, stethoscope moved around her neck and looked at me. We had had this argument for longer than Melody was old. “ “uh wuh, this is, Sometimes I see… blood or something in the water when you, uh, bathe me” I flushed, humiliated at the thought. “Am i? Okay? Is it, is everything going… going?”


Dr. Maples was already nodding along, completely at ease. She grinned and shook my leg playfully.


“Hun, I would mention if anything went wrong, trust me. You’re like my kid, I would kill for you,” she winked, as if we were in on some state secret together, before she leaned back, back to business. “However, the bleeding is completely normal- “ launching into increasingly vulgar details of my whosit and how it was affecting my whatsit until I was green in the gills.


“Stop, stop, oh my good lord stop-” I squealed. “ I don't wanna know! Forget what I asked!” she chirped and tittered, amused. Conversations are now few and far between, if they happen at all.


I was tired. God was I tired.


Melody, when not at school or working, was in her room futzing around. I don’t blame her now for avoiding me, what with how angry I had been, how scared. However, in the moment I held a selfish fury. My husband was a fucking ghost, now my own daughter won’t even look at me? I was never good at keeping anger alive, but this fire was smoldering and dense, pinning me in my sweltering prison just as well belonging to the parasite inside of me.


I went into labor out of nowhere at the beginning of the third trimester. My core contracted all at once, bullying my stomach, intestines, and bladder out of the way to make room for the violent stone weighing in my uterus. The pain was blinding and deep, barely a pain and more a pin point of  burning pressure and mindless fear. The sensation was not unlike boiling water- so scalding that, for a moment, your hand is frozen solid. 


I grunted and jackknifed before collapsing back into the puddle of discharge below me. My water had broken and in the same moment, a deep ache began in the center of my back. Pressure building outwards until something inside me just- popped and my hands went cold. The burning pressure moved, short rough spasms.


I dared to try and look only to see my stomach shifting and stretching, moving downwards. 


It was crawling out. I wasn’t dilated, nothing was ready and it did not care one fucking lick.


Gentle ringing caressed my ears, blocking outside stimulus. I screamed and screamed for the tiny chance I could break through the bells and wake up.


My wailing must have alerted melody as the next time I managed to open my eyes, there was Dr. Maples, perched over me.


  Her face was placid and blank, every hitch of breath caught her shrewd dark eyes. At my low moan of pain, Those empty pinholes melted. her face was now lined with worry, a pinch in her lips I've never seen before. She sat with me, her cold hands soothing my sweat lined brow. I was nothing but a stagnant bloated tick at this point. She had the cordless phone to her ear as she shouted at whatever poor soul was on the other end of the line. I registered being rolled over, encouraged to rest on my hands and knees but, God, it was too much. It was all too much to bear.


“ h…l’p… ma..” was all i managed before awareness was mercifully stripped away with a familiar pinch between my toes.,


Flashes of the labor, soundless and blurry, are all I have. Flashes of red water and tiny hands, sharp and clinical.


I remember seeing my stomach bow outwards, the skin bleeding green purple blue, capillary sunburst around my navel, stretching outward as if the skin of my gut was nothing but a thin latex barrier. Any moment the pressure was sure to rupture my stomach, internally disemboweling me. 


Later, in a green and pink economy hospital room, when the baby was swaddled tight and placed almost forcefully in my trembling arms, I was told it was a Boy.  9 pounds, 3 ounces, something called fetal macrosomia.


“Congratulations, mom” the nurse chirped happily, oblivious to my mounting dread. “You did amazing, barely any stitches for such a large guy,” she wiggled her finger in his face, chuckling when his stumpy fingers took a vice-like grip. Her bubbly smile turned to a small grimace as she tried to pry her finger away. I swear tears began forming before the thing decided she was no longer fun and deigned to drop her hand.


  As my mother complained, and Charlie cooed over the little bundle, I stared. It stared back.


Its face was a disgusting shade of pink white, shriveled and pinched in a scowl. It was streaked in blood and fluid and looked right at me with a shrewd curl of its lip. It had my red hair, and I guess it’s nose looked like charlie. 


The nurse, Cindy, helped adjust him on my chest, draping a blanket to give me some privacy to feed him. A yelp burst forth as it bit down, tiny teeth sinking into the flesh under it. Shifting didn’t dislodge anything as its nails were biting just as harshly  into my chest. I went still, revulsed and horrified as it contentedly suckled blood and milk.


Mel, who had tucked herself against my side some time ago, spoke up, quiet and thin as if afraid to catch her brother’s attention.


“Do we have to take it home?”


 Lolling my head down, lips catching weakly on the crown of her head in a gentle kiss, I wept.
