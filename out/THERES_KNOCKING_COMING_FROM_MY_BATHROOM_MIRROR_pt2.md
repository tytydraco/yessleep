*KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*

(The loud, rhythmic beating that I had convinced myself was imaginary was real — and it was getting louder.)

I rose from my bed, half-drunk and disoriented.
Beer cans littered the cramped apartment.
Jazz music screamed from the speakers like a mockery of my sadness.
I was sure it was the cops.

Someone must’ve called them — some faceless, nosy neighbor finally snapping under the weight of my noise, my music, my sobbing.
Hard to blame them.
It was 3:30 a.m.
Saturday morning.

I turned down the music, the silence hitting harder than the sound.
I stumbled halfway down the dim, narrow hallway, moving toward the front door.
That’s when I heard it clearly.
The knocking.

But it wasn’t coming from the door.
It was coming from the bathroom.

The bathroom door — always left wide open for my late-night emergencies — was now completely shut.
No light from within, only a faint, sickly purple glow seeping through the crack at the bottom.
I could feel something on the other side.

I should’ve gone for a gun.
But I already questioned my own sanity far too much to trust myself with one.
Instead, I went for the kitchen knife — a poor man's security blanket.

I lived alone.
I locked my door.
I lived on the third floor.
Whoever was in there had no right to exist.

I caught a glimpse of my pill bottles on the counter and prayed, Please, let this be the meds.

I crept to the bathroom door, breathing shallowly, listening.

*KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*

I moved.

I crashed through the door, slamming the light switch with one hand, knife raised in the other, ready to fight, ready to bleed, ready to kill.

"WHO'S FUCKING WITH ME?!" I roared, my voice breaking through the stale air.

The light flickered on.

And there was nothing.
Nothing but me, a knife, and the hollow echo of my own breathing.

I almost laughed.
Almost.

Then I heard it: a slow, deliberate tapping.

I turned my head, following the noise until my eyes found the mirror.

And there I was.
Or something that wore my face.

It smiled — a sick, hungry smile — and tapped its knife against the glass...

It looked at me like a predator looks at prey it’s been hunting for years.
Like I was already dead.

Behind it, the purple glow pulsed faintly, as if it were alive, breathing.

I stumbled back, collapsing onto the cold, unforgiving floor.

"What the fuck..." I whispered, barely able to find my voice.

The figure spoke without moving its lips.

"Hello, Michael."

Its voice seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere, sinking into my skull like a worm burrowing into soft flesh.

Its eyes pinned me down — black, unrelenting — turning any flicker of bravery inside me into something cold, limp, and useless.
The fire I had once watched consume men now burned behind those almost-familiar eyes.

"What are you?!" I demanded, though the words tasted weak and hollow as they left me.

The thing's smile faltered, a glimmer of irritation crossing its face.

"Aww, Michael," it purred. "Have you truly no idea who I am?"

I shook my head, barely breathing.

The smile returned — wider now, grotesque, splitting its face in two.

"I am Villovell," it said.
"And I’m here to answer your prayers.
