I have been following the comments more closely now. The motel Wi-Fi is spotty, but I check every few hours. Some suggestions are out there, like getting a dog or more cameras. But one really got me thinking. The idea of raising the whole house. Jack it up, pour a new foundation, turn the crawlspace into a full basement or just fill it in. Get rid of the nest entirely. Bonus points for a mancave or whatever. It sounded extreme, but after the peace offering made everything feel too close, too personal, I needed something big. Something permanent.



I drove back to the house the next day. Locked the car doors while I searched online from the driveway. House lifting is a real thing. Companies do it for historic homes or flood repairs. I found a local outfit about an hour away, family-run, good reviews. I called them up. Told them the foundation was settling unevenly, needed to be raised a foot or two for better drainage. They quoted me five figures, but said they could start in a week if I paid half upfront. I wired the money. What else was I going to do?



The crew showed up yesterday morning. Four guys, plus the foreman. Big equipment. Hydraulic jacks, steel beams, excavators idling in the yard. They walked the perimeter first, checking the structure. I pointed out the crawlspace access, but kept the story simple. Bad smells, possible pests, wanted it gone. They nodded, said it was doable. They'd shore up the house, lift it slow over a couple days, then dig out underneath and pour concrete.



They started by digging test pits around the foundation. That's when things got weird. The first guy in the hole under the guest bedroom side yelled up after five minutes. Said the dirt smelled funny, like spoiled milk and copper. The others laughed it off, blamed old septic or something. But I knew. The sweet-metal tang was back, stronger outside now.



By noon they had the jacks positioned. They cranked them up a few inches to test. The house groaned, normal for old wood. Then the listening feeling hit. Not just me. The foreman paused, looked around. Asked if I heard something. Like whispering under the ground. I lied, said no.



They kept going. Raised it another inch. That's when the first incident happened. One worker was crawling under to adjust a beam. He scrambled out fast, face pale. Said something grabbed his ankle. Not hard, but cold and tight, like bony fingers. The others checked. Nothing there. No roots, no animals. They chalked it up to nerves, but he sat out the next hour.



Afternoon came. They had the house up about six inches all around. Stable on the jacks. Now the digging started. Small excavator clawing at the dirt under the guest room. The bucket hit something soft first. Pulled up shredded cloth and bone fragments. The crew stopped. Asked if I knew about any burials. I played dumb, said maybe old farm trash. But the smell exploded out, thick enough to gag everyone.



Then the violence started. The excavator arm jerked suddenly, like something yanked it from below. The operator swore, said the controls locked up. When he forced it back, the bucket came up with fresh gouges. Four parallel lines, deep in the metal. Not from rocks. Claws.



The workers muttered. One crossed himself. They tried again. This time, a low growl rolled out from the hole. Not animal. Deeper, wetter, like gargling gravel. Everyone froze. Then tools started flying. A shovel lifted on its own, swung hard at a guy's leg. Missed by inches, but he went down yelling. Another beam shifted, pinning a worker's boot. He pulled free, but his face was cut from falling.



The foreman called it. Said the site was unsafe, equipment malfunctioning, they were out. Refunded my deposit minus a day rate. Packed up in under twenty minutes. As they drove off, one looked back at the house. Told me to call a priest, not contractors.



I stood there alone. The house hovered on jacks, crawlspace exposed like an open wound. The outline of the nest was clearer now. Deeper. And fresh dirt piled beside it, like something had dug out during the chaos.



That night I stayed in the motel again. But around 3 a.m., my phone buzzed. Motion alert from the webcam still set up inside. I logged in. The feed showed the living room, shadows long under the lifted floor. Then movement. The shape, clearer than ever. Tall, thin, folding through the hallway. It paused at the camera. Tilted its head wrong. And for the first time, I saw eyes. Reflective, like wet coins.



It reached out. The feed cut.



This morning I drove by. The jacks are still there, but one side has sunk. Like something pushed back from underneath. The smell lingers in the yard.



I can't keep pretending this is fixable. Every attempt just makes it stronger. More aware of me. More willing to show what it can really do. I'm packing what I can tonight. Leaving for good tomorrow. If it follows, at least I'll be moving. If it stays, maybe the house will finally be empty again. Either way, I don't think I'll ever sleep easy knowing what I left behind.
