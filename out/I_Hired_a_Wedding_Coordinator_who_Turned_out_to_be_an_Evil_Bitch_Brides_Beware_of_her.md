My wedding. It should have been the happiest day of my life. One that should forever be ingrained into my heart and remembered with nothing but fondness. It had been a day I longed for, ever since I was a little girl who had been enamoured by Disney Princess’ and their perfect fairy tale romance.

Nothing could prepare me for what mine turned into.

I intend to explain everything that happened, and to warn other brides-to-be. There is a great evil lurking within the wedding industry, one that is incredibly hard to trace. The best I can do, is recount my experiences of it and make you aware so that you can be spared of the heartache I was forced to endure.

When I met Joe - a chance encounter while at a local restaurant, celebrating my 23rd birthday - I knew that my childhood dream was a step closer to coming true. It was the greatest birthday present I could ever have imagined. I fell in love with him faster than any of my previous partners, and knew he would be the one I would spend the rest of my life with. He was not the most masculine of men, nor the smartest or even the most attractive. He was, as my Dad had often joked, “an ordinary Joe, with a heart of Gold.” One thing led to the other, and, after two years of dating, he proposed.

So began the madness of wedding planning.

Being the youngest and last in the family to get married, I had already seen first-hand the stress in which my three older sisters endured as they prepared for their special days. t was the one thing I was dreading when it would eventually be my turn to tie the knot. All of them ended up having amazing weddings. Yet, as I sought their advice in the initial days after getting engaged, all three of them had said the exact same thing: They would have enjoyed the day more if someone else was coordinating it.

Of all the advice I got, it was that which resonated with me the most. It made me sick to imagine myself looking back on my wedding day and feeling the slightest bit of regret. My mind needed to be free from all the distractions of coordination. If my special day was to be as perfect as I dreamed, I needed to hire a Wedding Coordinator.

Joe was supportive of my decision - nothing unusual there - but not Mum. Being a hard headed woman who, with my Dad, had busted their asses to build the life that me and my Sisters took for granted, she was notorious for her strong opinions on “necessary ways to spend money.” She chided me when I mentioned the idea of hiring a Wedding Coordinator.

Her and Dad had already stressed that they were going to pay for half the wedding, (Joe’s parents, paying for their side) even though Joe and I could well afford to pay on our own. It infuriated me that she would be so angry with me putting a lousy $2000 - the price for a good coordinator - towards my own wedding.

My Sisters were kind enough to argue my case to her. She finally gave in, but under one strict condition that she simply refused to budge for: I could not spend more than $200 on a Wedding Coordinator. If I did, my “wedding gift” from my parents - $100,000, the same that my sisters got, the sum of constant reinvesting ever since we were born - would be withheld for another two years. Help from Joe’s parents didn’t count either. I was to prove that I could withhold from “impulsively splurging my money on something pointless”, before I could receive her very helpful gift. Dad, always the submissive, did not argue.

Joe and I had good savings, but topped with the $100,000, we would be able to purchase our forever home. As much as I despised Mum for what Joe and I agreed was utter stupidity, we could not afford to violate it.

And so I began the dismaying search for a Wedding Coordinator that would fit within the unrealistic price range.

Months passed, and we had managed to book in the Celebrant, venue, photographers, flowers, cars, hair and makeup and had purchased the groomsmen suits, bridesmaid dresses, and even my wedding dress. Yet, the one thing that I wanted above all else, still evaded my grasp. The cheapest wedding coordinator that I had found so far, was $600. The wedding was already going to cost close to $20,000, and I argued with Mum what an extra $400 was. Out of my own pocket, mind you!

“$400 saved, is $400 gained,” my tight-ass Mother replied. “Think of our gift.”

I resorted to offering a friend, or one of my sisters the role, but Joe convinced me not to bother. My beautiful husband-to-be, wanted all of our guests to enjoy the day, and didn't want the burden of coordinating it to fall on them. He promised me, that if I failed to find one he’d share the burden with me. As he said, “Your sisters, managed, and our wedding is not much different to their's. Why can’t we manage without one too?”

With the day drawing closer and still unable to find a coordinator, I resigned to accepting Joe’s perspective.

That was, until the wedding expo came to my town.

There was only one month to go before the wedding, and everything was already booked and deposits paid for. It was kind of pointless for me to attend the expo, for such events were catered for the newly engaged. The place would be abundant with Wedding Coordinators, all of which I had probably already contacted. But I couldn’t brush aside a rather optimistic thought: What if there was one, just one, that I had not contacted yet? As Dad always said, “You’ll never know unless you try.”

So I went to the expo. I walked through the many isles, brushing shoulders with the newly engaged, and passed stall after stall of eager merchants keen for a new booking. All up, there were twenty five business’s present that had a Wedding coordinator included in their list of services, and sure enough, I had enquired with all of them.

Dismayed, I left the building and trudged through the car park with slumped shoulders. I had just unlocked my car, when something caught my eye. Parked on the opposite end from where I was, was a glossy purple van. Printed on it’s sides in elegant script were the words, "Jeanie, mistress of coordination,  who'll make your special day last forever.”

My heart lurched as hope began to trickle into my veins.

Butterflies fluttered in my stomach, driving me into a brisk walk towards that purple van. I halted just close enough to take a clear photo of the contact details written in small font at the bottom.

I had just put my phone back into my pocket when the tailgate began to open. I froze as I watched it rise in slow motion.

Inside, a middle aged woman sat cross legged on a sofa, smiling at me. Her shining raven dark hair was tied back in a tight ponytail. She wore a grey skirt that revealed just enough of her shapely thighs. Beneath her grey blazer, she was topless, the creamy smooth skin of her cleavage drawing my eyes with a magnetic-like force. There was a seductive air about her, and I instantly felt uncomfortable. My mind screamed at me to turn around and return to my car, but my eyes refused to tear themselves free from the bulge of her perfect breasts.

Now I swear on my life, I have always been loyal to Joe, and have always been attracted to Males. But, I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t feel a strange sense of arousal when I first met Jeanie Lilly.

“Eyes up here, sweetheart,” the woman said, blocking my view of her breasts with her hands pointing to her face. I did as she beckoned, with great reluctance, and looked into the most intense eyes I’d ever seen. They were a deep hazel colour, yet I swear there was a sort of golden tinge to them. Combined with her natural long lashes, this woman was far more beautiful than I could ever have have imagined.

“Jeanie Lilly, at your service. And what shall I call this lovely young lady caught gawking at my van?”

I swallowed with a great effort. “Sylvia.”

“Ah, such a beautiful name for a beautiful lady. So, you’re looking for a Wedding Coordinator are you?” Her voice had the purr of an experienced seductress.

I merely nodded.

“Then you’ve come to the right place, sweetheart. Hop in and take a seat, it’s awfully hot out there and we have a lot to discuss.”

Even though I was a 26 year old woman, I couldn’t help feeling ashamed of myself as I violated one of the most important lessons I was taught as a child, and mindlessly entered the stranger’s van.

As soon as I entered, the tailgate began to shut, and a soothing music filled the cab. Jeanie pulled out two champagne glasses from a small cupboard to her left, and began to fill them both up with what I thought was wine.

She noticed my concern. “It’s rose water, darling, you’ll still be able to drive home, I promise.”

I took the offered glass and took a hesitant sip. Satisfied she was no liar, I drained the glass to soothe my parched throat.

“Wedding organisation sure is some thirsty work isn’t it?” she asked.

"Yes, it is very exhausting,” I replied.

She outstretched an arm so that it was resting along the top of the sofa. Her blazer stretched to the point that I could see the edge of a nipple. She smiled as she began tapping her long, black exquisite nails on the leather. “I can help alleviate a lot of your stress. Tell me, have you got your day sorted yet?”

“Yes, the 23rd of November.”

Jeanie nodded. “One month away. Nice. Shot-gun wedding?”

“No, we’ve been engaged for a year. Everything has already been organised.”

Jeanie tilted her head and a gave a mischievous side smirk. “Except your Wedding day coordinator?”

“Yes, I came to the expo to see if there would be any I hadn’t contacted yet. Mum placed a strict budget on us getting one, and so far, none have come close with their price. Turns out I've already contacted all the ones that are here today. That is-

“-Until fate brought you to this van!” Jeanie exclaimed. She leaned forward, suddenly becoming a giddy schoolgirl. “OH MY GOD, darling! You have literally just hit the jackpot!”

“Why’s that?” I asked, my mind racing.

She clasped my hands tight between hers and brought her pretty face within inches of mine. “I don’t charge!”

My face twisted into a frown. Such a notion was simply too good to be true. Why in God’s name would someone offer their services without charging for them?

Sensing my confusion, Jeanie pressed on, “I have a bit of a fetish, Sylvia. It is something quite odd, so bear with me.” Her grip tightened on my hands. “Nothing gets me off more, than seeing the makeup smeared all over a brides face as she struggles through the tears of denial that her perfect day has finally come to an end. Cruel, I know, I just can’t help saying it as it is. It is my life’s joy, making girls wedding days as perfect as possible. Guests will dance their heart away, and, without the burden of keeping the schedule, you’ll lose track of the time as you get lost in the euphoria of it all. The party only ends, when the party dies.”

As odd as it all sounded, the passion reverberated from her like a strong air freshener. She clearly meant everything she said.

“But surely, you must seek some sort of payment?” I asked, unable to fathom her mindset.

Jeanie shook her head. “The only payment, is seeing the joy on your face, sweetheart. Euphoria is all I want. Your own, your Husband’s, the bridal party, and all the guests. It is a Euphoria that can only be experienced once in a lifetime, before the party inevitably dies. No amount of money can equate to the empowering feeling of knowing I was the Magician who allowed such positive energy to manifest.”

Stupid me, should have realised just how fucking bizarre this whole ordeal was and got my ass out of that van ASAP. She was clearly using the event, placing her van strategically in a parking lot frequented by Brides-to-be, to attain business without paying for a stand in the exhibition. Jeanie’s questionable business ethics should have reeked of Scam. Hell, I think I was the only girl who had attended the expo, dumb enough to be ensnared.

But after months of disappointment and a deep desire to have the most perfect day ever, my mind was vulnerable to delusion. Despite the odd payment, everything that Jeanie said was exactly what I wanted: A day of Euphoria. So I booked her.

Jeanie was ecstatic and went on to tell me that I would not regret it. She insisted we go through the itinerary sheet while we were together. I had it saved on my phone and opened it up to the plan that I had already made, thinking I was going to be the one to make sure it all happened when it was supposed to.

Jeanie skimmed through it, copying it word for word on a sheet of paper for her own reference. When she finished, she held out the sheet and pointed at the final time-slot: 11.30pm - Festivities end.

“Why so early, sweetheart?” she asked, eyebrows raised.

“Well, it’s an hour drive to the hotel that we are staying in for the night, and our plane leaves for our honeymoon destination at 10am the following day. Thought we’d end it half an hour earlier than most so we could get a good night’s rest.”

Jeanie stared at me for a few moments, her mouth hanging limp. She then burst out laughing. “You’d end a once in a lifetime celebration early, just to be in bed on time!? That’s hilarious!” Her laughter become hysterical and it took a good half minute before she calmed down enough to continue. “Sweetheart, how can the Euphoria possibly manifest if the night is cut so short? Even midnight is farrr too early!”

Wiping away the tears that were forming in her eyes, Jeanie pulled a red pen out of her blazer pocket and crossed out the whole 11.30pm slot. Next to it, she wrote in bold capital letters, The Party ends when the Party dies.

“Where’s your honeymoon destination?”

“Greece-"

“GREECE!” she spat. “Darling, you’ll have nearly a whole 24 hours to rest and recover from your big night! What else do you think you’ll be doing through such a long flight?”

“But-

“Honey, listen to me,” she said, grabbing both my hands again with a gentle firmness. “The Party ends, when the Party dies. If you want to use my services to make your day as unforgettable as it deserves to be, than you must respect that rule. It is utter foolishness to end it any earlier. Euphoria takes time to run it’s course. Trust me, you’ll know exactly when the night’s about to end.”

She handed me my phone back, and told me that there was no need to see her again until the wedding day. She assured me that she would be in contact with the venue, photographers, Celebrant and MC and have everything nailed down to a tee. Everything would run smoothly, she promised.

When I exited the van, and watched it immediately drive away - the thought not even occurring to me that someone else had been sitting in the drivers seat the whole time - I was satisfied and already feeling a tinge of the Euphoria that Jeanie was so adamant in bringing to the wedding.

I wish with all my heart that I could go back in time and slap that stupid-bimbo-bride-to-be that I was. I’d scream in her face, demanding her to look up Jeanie’s business on Google, to see that there was absolutely nothing mentioned of it online, not even a fucking advertisement on craigslist! Id tell her to get her shit together and cancel the booking with that Evil Bitch. When she’d inevitably argue, I’d tell her that 200 people were going to die if she did not.

Alas, time machines don’t exist and I am burdened to live with the consequences for my choices that day. If it’s possible, I hope they would forgive me for what happened to them, for I’ll never be able to grant forgiveness to myself for my stupidity.

When I returned home, I told Mum and Joe about it. I decided to leave out Jeanie’s bizarre form of payment and simply told them that she was happy to offer her Coordination services for our $200 budget. I knew that Joe would have been sceptical if he found out that Jeanie didn’t charge. Mum would have absolutely freaked out, convinced that I was inviting someone who was only there to steal from the wishing well.

As the day drew closer, even I began to question whether I should be relying on Jeanie. No deposit had been made to guarantee that she would even show up. I only had her word to go off. I deemed the chances 50/50, and made preparations to coordinate the day myself, should she not come.

The big day finally arrived. I had awoken at 6am to share a final breakfast as an unmarried woman with Mum and Dad. I deemed this to be a special moment to savour, the calm before the storm you could say. The bridesmaids were scheduled to arrive at 7.30am, followed by hair and makeup commencing at 8am.

I had literally just made my morning coffee and sat at the kitchen table next to my parents, when the doorbell rang.

My heart jolted, for a moment thinking that I had lost track of the time. But when I saw it was only 6.30am, my skin prickled with irritation. Convinced that it was one of the bridesmaids deciding to show up an hour earlier than specified, I stormed to the door. Already, the day’s schedule was compromised.

I threw open the door, and there was Jeanie.

She was dressed in the same grey attire as our first meeting, the only difference being that her hair was out. It shone like polished ebony and reached all the way down to her waist.

“Sylvia!” she exclaimed, before leaning in and kissing me on the cheek. “Are you excited for a day of Euphoria?”

“Yes,” I said as I let her into the house, still processing her sudden presence. Mum was strangely welcoming to her, and Dad was simply enamored.

Jeanie spoke vibrantly, and neither Mum, Dad or myself got much of a word in. Thus was Jeanie’s first crime against me; Intruding on what should have been a sacred hour spent with just my Parents. I would never get that opportunity again.

The Bridesmaids showed up on schedule, filling the house with the babble of excited girls, and still, Jeanie managed to usurp all of the attention. When the Hair and Make-up lady arrived, Jeanie stood in the background, watching me with a mischievous smirk as I was worked on. Her presence seemed to cast the same spell on all of us, that being to see her with awe and to become enthralled to her. I was supposed to be the centre of attention, not her. My Jealousy towards Jeanie only grew, despite myself also being enthralled to her.

When the photographers arrived at 10.30am, I asked Jeanie if she would be going to Joe’s house to check that everything there was running to schedule.

“Sweetheart, all the groom has to to do is put on a suit and wait for you to arrive at the venue,” Jeanie said. “You are the star of the day, therefore, I’ll prioritise my presence being close to you. There's a lot happening here, Sylvia, lots of people to coordinate.”

I didn’t argue with her, and so she remained at my house for the duration of the pre-wedding festivities.

When we left for the venue - wedding ceremony was scheduled for 1pm - Jeanie’s purple van followed close behind us in the wedding cars. I managed a brief glimpse of it through the side mirror, and could just make out her figure in the passenger seat. Driving the van though, was a strange looking man. He wore a sort of tuxedo. It was hard to make out a clear image, but in that moment, I was certain that the skin of his face glowed red.

We arrived at the venue, -an amazing outdoor garden with exquisite mountain views - and Mum and Dad walked me down the aisle. It would forever be a moment engraved in my heart. Filtered sunlight from a Jacaranda tree illuminated my soon to be Husband, giving him an ethereal glow. Joe stood there watching my approach, his eyes bulging out of their sockets as tears poured out. When I reached him, he violated all traditional wedding protocol. He lifted my veil and kissed me long and hard on the mouth, his tears mixing with my own.

“I fucking love you so much,” he said when we finished.

My response was pressing my lips to his and resuming the hookup.

Realising there was an audience of 200 people watching our passion and waiting for further ceremonies to begin, I reluctantly tore my lips from Joe’s and spun around to face them. I felt my face grow hot as the guests began to clap. I gave an embarrassed smile, and instinctively switched my gaze to my parents, ready to meet Mum’s scowling face. She was only smiling warmly.

The moment would have been the perfect sowing of the day's Euphoria, had my eyes not fallen on Jeanie, standing next to my parents on the first row. She gave me that seductive smile, and despite this being a special moment between Joe and I, I felt an unwanted warmness develop in my loins, such that I wasn’t expecting to feel till I was laying in bed at the hotel later that night.

I realised then, that whenever I looked at her, my body was prompted to do two things: Feel an unprecedented arousal, and all outward communication to become enthralled to her. It’s hard to explain the latter other than being like this: In my mind, I was loathing her, wanting to tell her to get the fuck off that special row and sit at the very rear behind everyone else. But my body language refused to show any of this. I merely smiled like her presence was the very highlight of the entire wedding.

Desiring to ignore her, I switched my gaze to the second row where my Sisters and their families sat. I got the beautiful image of all my loved ones smiling at me. But it was ruined by Jeanie. Her sultry form was a black stain on the family portrait.

My mind screamed at my body to point to the last row and tell her to sit there. But, it would not obey.

The Celebrant cleared his throat, prompting Joe and I to turn around to begin the ceremony. We would go on to say our vowels and promise a lifetime of love and loyalty to each other. But as Joe’s watery eyes looked into mine with nothing but love as he placed the ring on my finger, all of my attention was on the Woman in Grey, sitting conveniently in my peripheral. The memory of that special moment being tainted by that Bitch is so infuriating, that several keys on my keyboard are now stuck in place.

When the ceremony concluded, the guests went to mingle and enjoy a bountiful afternoon tea, whilst Joe and I, accompanied by the bridal party, went out into the gardens where photography was to take place.

We got hundreds of beautiful images. I have them beside me now as I write. Everyone looked so happy and elegant, like it was the prime moment of their lives. Joe, oh Joe was so handsome. The only negative thing I have to say about them, revolves around myself.

In not a single photo, was I looking directly at the camera. I faced in that direction, but my eyes were looking slightly to the side. At what you might ask? Well that would be Jeanie of course, who had been standing beside the photographer for the entire photo shoot!

When I first saw these photos, it sated at least one thing that had been troubling me ever since that day. Joe wasn’t under her spell. The irony of it makes me burn, for the primary emotion that screamed in my mind the entire day, was Jealousy. Jealousy that the Sultry Bitch was catching Joe’s eyes as she was to me.

So you get the idea of what the day was like for me. Instead of feeling Euphoric, it was rank with emotions I didn’t want. Everything went well, and everyone was having a great time, except me. My body language showed that I did, but only I know what I was battling inside.

The 9.30pm dancing began as usual. Joe and I’s first dance, followed by the bridal party and then the open dance floor. The first few songs were mellow to allow for couples to waltz. It eventually transitioned to modern dance music, and it was here where the party really started happening. I swear, even the oldies were on the dance floor, pumping their fists to 2000’s rave hits. The energy in the room was ecstatic. Euphoric.

I hadn't seen Jeanie since the dancing began, and before long I had forgotten about her as I too became lost in the moment. I danced the night away, switching between Joe, my sisters, cousins, and friends. The long hem of my dress was tattered with all the people stepping all over it as they partied on the dance floor. All 200 guests were there.

I eventually lost track of the time. I was certain that hours had passed and was awaiting to hear from Jeanie to tell me that it was time to start wrapping things up. I remembered her strange notion, that the party ends when the party dies. Looking at the throng of dancing guests, drinking and laughing their hearts out, I could not see the party dying anytime soon.

I returned to the bridal table to have a well earned glass of water. While I was up there, I thought I’d check the time. There was literally not a single clock in the function room, so my next best bet was my sisters phone. Being the maid of honour, she left her purse next to my own seat when she had gone down to dance. I opened it up, and flicked on the phone.

It said 9.30pm.

Confused, I turned it off then back on again. Still 9.30pm.

I knew this couldn’t be right, as the dancing had easily been going on for at least two hours. The exhaustion that was starting to settle into my bones was enough to clarify this.

Convinced that the phone was playing up, I grabbed my other sisters purse and turned on her phone. It too, displayed 9.30pm.

I blinked a few times, trying to get my head around it.

Unwilling to accept that this was true, I checked every phone on the bridal table. All of them showed 9.30pm.

I stared at the dancing crowd below me, hoping that someone would notice the puzzled expression on my face and start laughing. I hoped it was just some cruel practical joke being played by the bridal party.

A tap on my shoulder startled me. It was Jeanie. Her pretty face was a mask of concern. I say a mask, because that Bitch was laughing inwardly at my dilemma.

“What’s the matter, dear?”

I held up one of the phones, pointing at the time. “It’s only 9.30pm! All the phones say so! Something isn't right.”

Jeanie reached into her own pocket and pulled her own phone out, holding it out so I could see the display. 9.30pm.

“I don’t understand what the problem is, sweetie?”

“We’ve been dancing for hours! I know it!”

“Well the clock says otherwise,” Jeanie replied, matter-of-factually. “Embrace it babe! Better to have the party go longer than you anticipated. That’s what makes this such a special day. Its a sign that the Euphoria is present!”

I was going to argue more, but I was being called back to the dance floor by my guests. I returned to them and resumed dancing, trying to clear my mind of the dilemma and enjoy the moment. I was convinced that the practical joke would come to an end soon enough.

After what felt like another two hours, I needed to go to the bathroom. So two of my sisters accompanied me there, helping with the wedding dress. We were busy chit-chatting away, when one of my sisters pulled out her phone. “Ah thank fuck!” she exclaimed. “It’s only 9.30! This party is only just getting started!”

The stream of my piss suddenly halted. “What the fuck is this all about! Can you please quit the joke, it’s starting to make me uncomfortable.”

My sister looked at me aghast. “Gee, what's up your bum? I’m just saying how much fun I’m having and the night is still young! You should be cheering, Sylvia!”

I felt my stomach churn like I had just been on a roller-coaster. Nothing was making sense. My body clock was screaming at me that it was close to 1am, not 9.30pm!

When we returned to the dance-floor, I was no longer in a partying mood. I needed to see the time from a clock that did not belong to someone I knew. I eyed the waiters as they moved through the room, clearing dirty plates from the tables as they bobbed to the music - the Euphoria gripping them too. There had to be a clock in their kitchen, for how else would they be able to serve the food at the designated times?

I managed to sneak away from the dance floor, pretending I was going over to the photo booth. Then, I slipped through the kitchen doors and entered where I wasn’t supposed to be. I was instantly met with the startled eyes of several unsuspecting staff. I was fortunate enough to see an analog clock hung high on the wall.

It was still 9.30pm!

I was about to scream, when a man grabbed me by the arm, and threw me back into the reception hall. I didn’t get a view of his face, only felt the searing heat coming from his unnaturally red hand. The doors to the kitchen slammed behind me.

I slumped against the wall, staring at the revelry encapsulating the room. I knew with all my sanity that we hadn't just started dancing. Despite everyone sweating and beginning to look very exhausted, they continued to party like there was no tomorrow.

And then my eyes fell upon something that made my heart jolt.

Within the thicket of party goers, a man lay on the floor. Not a single person noticed him even as some carelessly stepped on him. He writhed about, trying to move out of the way. I recognised his face at once. It was Dad. His face looked like it had been dunked in a bath. He panted like a dog as he clutched his chest.

I nearly tripped over my dress as I ran to him.

I shoved dancing family and friends aside until I was able to be near him. I screamed at everyone to move out the way, to help, but all just ignored me. I couldn’t believe it. I pulled my father by the arm and managed to get him a safe distance away from all the trampling feet. Only then did I notice the front of his suit covered in vomit.

“CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP!!!” I roared above the music, but not a single person responded. When they did look at me, they only continued smiling, paying no heed to the ailing man in my arms.

By this point I knew there was something heavily amiss but was so broken, scared and exhausted to be able to do anything about it. I merely sat there on the edge of the dance floor, holding my Dad as he slowly died.

Not a single guest noticed, as I cried hysterically.

As the night drew on for what felt to me like days, more of the guests began to collapse and succumb to their exhaustion. It started with the older ones; Mum - ever strong willed, ever strong bodied - being the last over-50 to finally given in to her exhaustion. The ones my age and younger -their bodies not unused to partying hard - followed shortly after. One by one, they collapsed and were trampled by oblivious revelers.

I cried and cried and cried, until the very last party goer, my dear Joe, fell over, his partying heart finally giving up.

I ran over to him, and cradled his head in my hands. I closed my eyes, hoping this was just some stupid nightmare and I would instead awaken on the true day of my wedding. The horrific silence of the dead party only remained.

I was a bitter mess, crying with all my heart for all 200 family and friends lying dead about me; All having died of exhaustion, a result of an unprecedented Euphoria.

“Now the Party ends, Sweetheart!”

I turned to see Jeanie, walking over to me, arm in arm with a tall and terrifying looking man. His face was a burnt red, his eyes a dark abyss. Even without context, I knew he was a Demon.

Jeanie began to laugh as she crouched down to my height and caressed my cheek. “Such a dynamic couple we are,” she jerked her head in the direction of her demonic company. “He get’s his souls, and I get to see another beautiful bride’s devastated face after I ruined her day!” She laughed a cackling witch’s laugh.

She began to undo the lower buttons of her blazer before tearing it off, revealing her full perfect naked torso. She slipped out of her skirt and stood before me, butt naked. The Demon began to fondle one of her breasts, licking her smooth neck with it’s forked tongue. She moaned with delight as the Demon tore it’s own clothes off with it’s sharp claws and threw her down onto her hands and knees right in front of me. She arched her backside with eagerness to receive him.

I forced my eyes shut, not wanting to bear witness to this unholy copulation. But the Bitch slapped me hard across the face, forcing me to reopen them. “You keep your eyes open! I wanna see the despair in your pretty eyes as I cum!!”

The Demon entered her, and she moaned with delight as they rutted for what felt like an eternity. She stared at me the entire time, rubbing her clitoris vigorously. She climaxed alongside the Demon, their Hellish moaning reducing my soul to smithereens.

With their copulation ended, they stood back up, making no effort to put their clothes back on. The Demon gave a fanged smile as he gazed at all the bodies littered about the room. He held his arm around Jeanie’s naked waist and began to lead her away.

Just as they were about to pass me, Jeanie hawked and spat a large gobbet of phlegm in my face. I was too paralysed to even wipe it off. She chuckled and pat me on the head like a dog. “You can go kill yourself now, you stupid Bitch. You’ll make a wonderful tree in Hell that I’m sure will attract all the harpies to tear at.”

And with that, her and the Demon departed, leaving me alone in a room full of silence.

One of my sisters lay dead not too far from me. Her phone was splayed out on the floor, and had somehow just turned on.

The time was 9.31pm.

Time had finally resumed it’s course, now that the party was officially dead.

I was little more than a hollow shell when the police eventually arrived at the reception hall. I was brought straight into ICU at the nearest hospital where I was placed under strict police guard for the duration of my stay. It would be nearly three days until I had fully recovered my senses.

Being the only survivor from my wedding - even the reception staff had all succumbed to the Euphoria - suspicion naturally fell onto me as having some part in it. But I was too much of an emotional wreck, to even begin talking about the day. Losing everyone that meant something to you in a single blow, is the hardest thing that anyone could ever recover from.

Frustration with my lack of communication eventually drove the investigators to bring in the Country’s top interrogators to finally get me to talk. I was taken to a Police station where I was locked in a room with two dour faced men.

I covered my face and broke into a fit of tears, after the first question was asked.

There was an intense shuffling in the room, and I braced myself for one of them to strike me. Then the door opened.

“Gentlemen, we’ll take care of the situation from here,” came a female voice. I peeked through my fingers, and saw two women enter. One was blonde, the other, brunette. Both wore dark glasses and had a very serious demeanour. They wore well fitted clothing, and unlike Jeanie, looked highly professional.

With slumped shoulders the two men left.

“Move your face from your hands, Sylvia, you have nothing to fear from us,” the blonde said.

I did as I was told, her soothing voice no doubt playing a large part.

The blonde pointed at her own chest. “I am detective Sonia, and this is detective Rebecca.”

Rebecca, the brunette continued, “We are going to jump straight to our own conclusions of what happened on your wedding night. You hired a dark haired woman dressed in grey to coordinate your wedding, didn’t you?”

I gulped hard, not liking where this was going. “Yes,” I croaked, my vocal chords rusty after nearly a week of disuse. “Her name is Jeanie Lilly.”

The two women shot each other a knowing glance. Sonia shook her head. “It was her then,” she said, more to herself than anything.

That comment sparked my interest. “You know about Jeanie?” I asked.

“First, tell us in full, your experience of the woman please.”

With great reluctance I recalled everything, from the initial meeting in the van at the bridal expo, to her final remark for me to go kill myself.

When I finished, I was crying again. Rebecca stepped forward and placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. “We are sorry this had to happen to you, Sylvia. But please know, if it gives you any comfort, your wedding was not the first she has ruined.”

I wiped my eyes and stared at her, determined to learn more. “How many then?”

“Thousands.”

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Surely such a killing streak would have reached the mainstream media by now. “But that’s impossible.”

“It’s very possible when you’ve had the same drive for the last 9000 years,” Sonia said.

I cocked my head, not getting where this was going.

Rebecca squeezed my shoulder gently. “She’s had many names over the years; Jeanie being the one she chose to ensnare you with. We call her the Jealous Bitch, for that is what she is. But her real name is Lilith.”

My mind raced as I tried to recall where I had heard that name before. I remembered a popular Metal song I used to listen to as a teenager called Lilith the metal lass, and my heart jolted to a halt.

It all made sense.

Jeanie was Lilith, the supposed first wife of Adam, turned Demonic temptress after her refusal to do Adam’s bidding in bed.

They must have sensed the recognition in my eyes. “Yes, that Lilith. She’s been ruining weddings ever since her divorce with Adam.” Sonia said. “We have only been tracing her for the last 10 years. There’s been scores of similar crimes around the world, all bearing the same theme. That of a woman in grey, with a seductive air about her, stressing a payment only of Euphoria, who, once all the guests have literally partied themselves to death, gets fucked by a demon as she soaks in the dismayed face of the bride.”

I couldn’t believe it. Of course it would be my luck to stumble upon this ancient Horror.

They went on to explain that her current sexual partner was a high ranking Demon officer from Hell. They work together to achieve their means. Her’s being the dark fetish of being fucked while looking at a despair gripped bride, His being the souls of all those killed at the wedding.

It filled me with the greatest of heartaches to know that all my guests; my friends, family, and beautiful Husband, were now trapped in a place of eternal torment. All because of me and my stupid desire for the perfect wedding.

Due to Rebecca and Sonia being deeply involved in investigating the spout of similar crimes from around the world, they were given the authority to determine what should happen with me. They deemed me innocent, and, after a lot of back and forth's, took me into their care.

As part of their investigations they had set up a group that was run entirely by women from a whole range of ethnicities, its purpose being to aid with the administration, and to assist in the world-wide tracking of Lilith and her Consort. All members shared one thing in common: We were all unfortunate brides who had had their weddings ruined by the Jealous Bitch.

With none of their families left alive, naturally, these victims of the same crime formed their own. I quickly became a part of this new family.

We are all driven by an immense desire to avenge all the loved-ones we have lost. Every day, we scour the internet for new businesses within the wedding industry, while others, such as myself, are on the lookout for the next incident, which I’m sad to say, will be imminent.

But I know, deep down in my heart, that we are getting close to stopping her, and boy, you have no idea how much I look forward to that day.

It is here in our headquarters - a secret place that Lilith will never learn of - that I write this warning for all you bride’s-to-be out there.

Plan your wedding, and Coordinate it yourself. The stress of doing so is far better than chancing your special day to be completely ruined, and all your loved-ones ending up in Hell. No word can ever be placed to describe the immense guilt you would feel, knowing you had a part in your spouse’s eternal torments.

I cannot tell you what name she will go by next, but I’d hate for it to be your wedding that she and her Demon consort ruin next.
