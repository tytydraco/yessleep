I just witnessed something I can’t explain. For context, I use wired headphones at my desktop. The cable is about three meters long, and I have it hanging on a microphone’s desk clamp so that the wire doesn’t drag on my head. It was late, probably around 2:30 or 3:00 AM, and I had just left my chair to get a bottle of water. I remember taking off my headphones and placing them on top of my PC case as I always do. When I need to grab something very close to my desk, I don’t need to take my headphones off, as the cable is long enough, but sometimes it gets caught on my chair’s armrest. That distance is probably at most about a meter.

I felt the same sort of friction or heaviness while walking out of my room’s door, even though I didn’t have my headphones on. I felt the cables as if they were hanging next to my legs, but it didn’t make any sense -- they should be hanging off of my desk. I double-checked that I had wires next to me and grabbed them with my right arm. I looked at them under the dim light of my monitor, and they were undoubtedly my headphone’s wire, as they have a special red tint and are braided. That would mean that my cable somehow extended by two or more meters. I got confused and tried to look back at my desk to see how the cable could reach that far, and the cables were gone from my hands and the floor.

After all of this happened, I checked how long the cable was to see if it somehow got tangled with other wires on the back of my PC, but even though it was tangled, it definitely didn’t look like a five-meter cable. I measured the distance from my desk to the stairs, which was as far as I had gone before I looked back, and it was about 17 feet. That’s actually an exaggeration, as my headphones are plugged into the back of my case through an HDMI port, which means it was even farther away. I know I wasn’t hallucinating or anything, even though it was late, as I physically felt the braided cable in my hands and heard the cable dragging on the floor because I don’t have a carpet. I got a new pair of headphones one week later, as the old ones were already in pretty bad condition, and that experience sorta freaked me out.

What happened here? Maybe it was so late that I somehow half-dreamed this all up or something? I didn’t take any pills or anything that would cause any sort of hallucinations, and I’ve never had anything like this happen to me before or since. The wire wasn’t disconnected from my PC after this happened, and the headphones still work fine. I can send images of the headphones and my setup if would help clear anything up.
