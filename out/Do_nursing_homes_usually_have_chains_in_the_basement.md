I own a small moving company in Mankato, Minnesota. It isn’t much, but I built it from the ground up. Now I have five employees. Or, rather, I used to have five employees. Three of them quit and two of them are still missing. The police gave up the search yesterday. They claim the basement just “isn’t that large.” When I complained to the county sheriff and told him everything I heard over the walkie talkies, he said I read too many Stephen King novels. I don’t know if he is simply covering up what happened, or if he genuinely believes there is nothing unusual going on in the basement. Either way, he has denied my requests to send an independent search party and instead plans on demolishing the building as soon as the city grants approval.

The nursing home has three floors. The day Sandro and Dennis disappeared, we split up into pairs and each took a floor. Jack and Pedro took the second floor. Me and Angel took the ground floor. And Dennis and Sandro got stuck in the basement. The city claimed they would turn the power back on while we cleaned, but when we arrived, the building was still dark. I sent Dennis to Home Depot to buy flashlights. Once he got back, they got to work, and that was the last time I ever saw them.

I heard bits and pieces over the walkies, but none of it made any sense. Dennis sounded scared and Sandro was crying. One of them mentioned something about chains on the walls. He said some other stuff too, but I would like to save that until the end. For now, I want to give you some context. I’ve spent the last four days doing the research I should have done in the first place. If I knew the things I know now, I would never have taken this job.

Old St. Peter Nursing home isn’t technically in St. Peter. It’s halfway between Mankato and St. Peter, overlooking the Minnesota river. It was abandoned in 2016 after a fire burned the west wing of the building and killed over 30 residents. A few weeks later, an insurance investigator proved the owners of the nursing home set the fire themselves. Residency decreased dramatically in the months leading up to the arson. Family members of residents reported everything from criminal neglect to physical and financial abuse. It was discovered in 2015 that a few of the nurses on staff had forged their diplomas. The nurses in question had all been convicted felons and used their connections at the nursing home to defraud the old and vulnerable. By now, I hope you get the idea. This is not a nice place. The fire and the felons are only the tip of the iceberg.

The really scary part, at least in my mind, is that no one knows how old the building truly is. It is a monument lost to history. There are no blueprints. No schematics. No newspaper articles. The earliest record I found is from October 1918. A postcard in the St. Peter library shows the front of the building, festooned in vines with a platoon of wounded soldiers posing for a picture. Most of the soldiers stood in crutches or sat in wheelchairs. Some had bandages on their faces. The post card said, “A retreat for our heroes!” The message on the back was from one of the soldiers that stayed there. It was pretty faded, and the handwriting was shaky, but this is what I made out.



Dear Jean,

I write this card as a mere reflection of the man you used to know. I wish not to speak of my time in the trenches, nor of my time in this dilapidated chateau they call a retreat. It is not a retreat. Though, I cannot seem to discern its true nature. I have a room that overlooks the garden, but the toothy flowers that grow here are unlike any I have encountered elsewhere. It is cold at night, and we do not have sufficient bedding nor is there sufficient ventilation in the building. The patients all fret about a fire, but I have been blessed that my room is very near the entrance. Many of the people here cannot walk. I fear that a fire would mean their doom. The building’s queer design causes many to lose their way. I wish you would come and take me away from this awful place before I am resigned to the basement. I have witnessed several of my copatients being led down the long, winding stairs. The ones that come back have a much paler appearance, and there is something different about their eyes. Sometimes I hear screams in the night. Please, Jean, whisk me away from this place. It reeks of that terrible, unexplainable odor that seemed to stain the trenches.

 

The name was missing from the bottom of the card. A quick Google search revealed the old building had been converted into a military hospital during the first World War. Though, the internet didn’t seem to know what purpose the building served before that point. A user on Reddit claims his great grandfather—who was a Sioux tribesman pardoned by Abraham Lincoln after the Sioux Uprising of 1862—was held there during his trial. The soldier from 1918 had called the building a dilapidated chateau. The idea that the building could have already been 55 or even 60 years old in 1918 sent goosebumps down my arms. During the building’s mysterious tenure, it served as a hideout for bootleggers, an orphanage, a ball-bearing factory, a school, and finally a nursing home.

Because the property was abandoned in such haste and the owners arrested, the building is filled with moth-eaten furniture. The tables and desks likewise are soft and porous from the moisture. The walls are painted with mold and mildew. It is an incredibly eerie experience to be in such an old building that is fully furnished, yet completely vacant. But it wasn’t the general eeriness that made my three surviving employees quit the job; it was everything we heard from the walkie talkies. I have urged my former employees to put pressure on the sheriff to conduct a more thorough search of the premises, but none of them will respond to me. They want nothing to do with the building, and I find it hard to blame them. 

I’ll finish my story by telling you the things we heard Dennis and Sandro say before they disappeared. You can judge for yourself whether it is right that my former employees refuse to press the matter. I will warn you now—these are the last words of men that are likely dead. I don’t know for sure, but the history of this old building does not fill me with much hope. If anyone ever asks you to clean out an abandoned building, please look into that building’s history. It might just save your life.



Dennis: Is it just me, or is there a draft down here?

Sandro: I didn’t know spiders could get that big.

Dennis: I thought you said this was the bottom floor?

Sandro: Why do those wheelchairs have handcuffs on them?

Dennis: Why is the ceiling leaking?

Sandro: We’ve been walking for five minutes in the same direction.

Dennis: I think we’re under the river.

Sandro: Those eyes don’t belong to rats.

Dennis: Did you see that girl?

Sandro: Do you hear that? It sounds like music.

Dennis: The wall was broken from the inside.

Sandro: Is that blood still wet?

Dennis: Didn’t we walk past that doll a few minutes ago?

Sandro: I thought the power was turned off. Why is that TV on? And what is he doing with that knife?

Dennis: Weren’t the residents moved to a different nursing home?

Sandro: Dennis don’t look at the TV. Shut your eyes and cover your ears.

Sandro: Stop running. I can’t keep up.

Sandro: Don’t go down those stairs.

Sandro: Don’t go toward the light.

Sandro: The voices aren’t real!

Sandro: Something ate my flashlight.

Sandro: I’ve been groping the walls for ten minutes. They go on forever.

Sandro: Why am I so hungry?

Sandro: I think there’s something inside me. I can feel it squirming.

Sandro: I can’t keep my eyelids open.

Sandro: I found a bed.

Sandro: Everyone else is already asleep.

Sandro: They look so peaceful. 

Sandro: I have to say my prayers.

Sandro: The nice man wants to trade eyes.

Sandro: I can’t wait to sleep.

Sandro: The nice man says I can lay down now.

Sandro: I can’t wait to sleep. I can’t wait. I can’t—

Sandro: I can’t wait. I can’t wait. I can’t—
