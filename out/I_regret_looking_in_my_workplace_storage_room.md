I’ve never had much luck keeping jobs. It’s not that I’m lazy or bad at what I do, far from it. I show up on time. I complete my tasks. I stay out of trouble. But I’ve never been much of a team player. I don’t joke around in the break room. I don’t sign birthday cards or pretend to care about Sharon’s weekend at her boyfriend’s shack in Victor Harbour. I come in, do what I’m paid to do, and clock out. That’s it. I guess a lot of people find that off-putting, so I usually end up getting fired after a few months. The longest job I ever held was at this warehouse outside of town. Stayed there a little over a year. I actually quit that one myself, which felt like a win at the time. I hope this helps explain why I did what I did.

 

I found the listing like I always do, scrolling through SEEK with one eye open, barely registering the words. It was for some local pizza joint. One of those sad little places that looks like it’s been dying slowly for years. Peeling signage, flickering open sign, no real online presence. I was surprised they were hiring at all, let alone looking for “reliable part-time staff for night shifts.” But I sent my resume through anyway, just like I did with a dozen other jobs that day and moved on. I didn’t expect a reply. I never really do. 

The first red flag I should’ve noticed was how quickly they had replied. Less than ten minutes had passed. No interview invitation, no follow-up questions. Just a short, cheerful message saying I could start the next evening if I was still interested. It caught me off guard, honestly. I re-read it a few times to make sure I was reading it right. They were pretty desperate. Almost as desperate as I was.

I rocked up the next night at about 9 pm. The place was a part of a rundown strip mall where half the shops hadn’t been rented out in nearly a decade. which I guessed belonged to other employees. I pulled up in my battered old Barina and stepped inside.  The contrast between the neglected exterior and the surprisingly active interior was striking. The lighting was poor: two fluorescent tubes were completely burnt out, and the remaining ones flickered and buzzed, casting an unsettling light over the kitchen. The air smelled of stale grease mixed with an unidentifiable odour that felt familiar yet unsettling. I was greeted by an overly friendly store manager. Tall, late forties maybe, wearing a grease-stained polo with the company’s logo embroidered half off his chest. He reached out to shake my hand with a grip that lingered just a second too long.

“Hiya, you must be Ron,” he said, his voice a little too bright. “Welcome to the team.”

He handed me a uniform, two sizes too big, still warm from the dryer, and started rattling off instructions. No tour. No training video. Just a handful of rushed sentences while the other employee grabbed their bag and headed out. “You’ll mostly be working solo,” he said, waving vaguely at the kitchen. “It’s 24 hours, but things quiet down after midnight. If anyone gives you trouble, lock the front and ignore them. Most of the regulars know the drill.”

He gestured toward a half-covered freezer door in the back.

“If you get an order, grab dough from the freezer. Instructions are up on the wall. Don’t overthink it. Just follow the pictures.”

He was already halfway to the door when he turned back, still smiling.  
“Call me if there’s an emergency,” he said. “Otherwise, have a fantastic night.”

His eyes didn’t match his smile. They were empty, like he was already somewhere else.

The first month of the job was pretty chill. Despite the weird vibes I got from the place, I got paid to scroll through my phone and microwave doughy pizzas for the handful of stragglers that wandered in during the early hours. My shift ran from 9 PM to 5 AM. No coworkers. No small talk. Honestly, it was the best job I’d had in years.

However, after a few weeks, I began to notice that there was this smell. Subtle at first, like something just slightly off. It came from the back, around where an old, blocked storage room was. At first, I assumed it was a busted drain or maybe a dead rat behind the wall. I even mentioned it in passing to the manager one night, but he brushed it off with a laugh and said, “Yeah, the old place has character.”

The smell got stronger over time. It clung to my uniform. Got in my hair. Some nights I’d come home and scrub myself raw just trying to get it off. I started spraying some air freshener around the back rooms when no one was looking. It didn’t help.

I wanted to quit. I didn’t want to be carrying around this smell with me everywhere I went. It always had a way of clinging to my skin, no matter how many times I would scrub and scrub at my skin. But the job paid, and it paid on time. That was more than I could say for most of the places I’d worked. And none of the other places I’d applied to had even bothered replying. So, I stayed. Miserable, stinking, but employed.

A few nights ago, we were busier than usual. And by busier, I mean two people walked in around the same time and actually placed orders. It doesn’t sound like much, but for a place like that, it was like a full-blown rush hour. While I was busy with the second order, something strange happened. I heard a sound. Nothing strange, just a sound. It was barely audible beneath the hum of the fridge and the microwave ticking away. It came from the back. A thump. Then a dragging sound. Like something being moved across the floor. I didn’t give it much thought at the time. I was busy, or at least as busy as someone can be microwaving frozen pizzas for two half-drunk uni students. I figured it was just an old pipe knocking around or the freezer compressor acting up. Places like that make all kinds of strange sounds when they settle. You stop noticing after a while.

But, for whatever reason, it was all I could think about. Even after the customers left and the store went quiet again, that sound kept replaying in my head. I had this underlying worry that there was someone in the back of the store. It was crazy since the only way to the back of the store was either through the front or through the back door, a heavy steel thing we only opened to take the rubbish out. And even then, it was always locked tight.

It was about 2 am at this point, and the thought was still eating away at me, so I figured I might as well check it out. It’s not like there was much to do front of house. So, I made my way to the back. The pizza place’s cramped kitchen led straight to a back hallway, barely wide enough for one person, lined with peeling paint and flickering fluorescent lights. There were also two adjacent rooms in the hall. One was the staff toilet, barely big enough to turn around in, and the other was the blocked-off storage room I’d mentioned before. Next to that was a row of dusty metal shelves stacked with cleaning supplies and old paperwork, and beyond that, the steel door that led to the bins out back.

Everything looked normal. But that didn’t make me feel any better.

Then the smell hit me again, a million times worse than it had ever been. It wasn’t just lingering in the air like before; it poured out of the hallway like a physical thing, thick and choking. The moment I took a breath, I gagged. My stomach turned instantly, and for a second, I thought I was actually going to throw up right there on the floor.

It was like rot and piss and something metallic beneath it all. 

I had to do something about it. It had always bothered me, but now it clung to the inside of my nose and was working its way down my throat to the point where I could taste it.

So, I tried to pry open the storeroom again. This time with much more force than I had previously used. I pulled and pulled and pulled. The frame groaned in protest. Rusted hinges shrieked. Then, all at once, the door gave way. It flew open with a sudden, violent snap, the force nearly throwing me off balance. I stumbled back a step, heart pounding, as the full weight of the stench surged out in a rush of air so thick it felt warm against my face.

The room was almost pitch black. The lights barely reached the back hallway, making it hard to see anything beyond the doorframe. I pulled out my phone and shone it into the storage room. The room was deceptively bigger than I initially had thought. From the outside, it looked like a cramped, forgotten closet barely large enough to store a mop bucket. But the inside stretched back far deeper than it should have. I stepped through, trying to find the possum or whatever had decided to give up and die in the back of this shitty pizza restaurant. There were some old cardboard cutouts of failed mascot attempts from back in the early 2000s. The youngest thing I could find in this room was a promotional flyer from 2011.

 

Eventually, in the very back of the room, half-hidden behind some dusty metal shelving, I found the source: three large black garbage bags, slumped and bulging, sitting side by side.

At first, I thought maybe some careless staff member had just left trash here, forgotten about it for months or even years. Rotten food scraps, old meat, spilled oil congealed into a sticky, sour mess. I tried to grab hold of one of the bags, planning to drag it toward the back door so I could finally get rid of whatever was rotting in there. But the bag didn’t budge. Not even a little.

What could possibly be in these bags was the furthest thing from anything I wanted to imagine.

I curiously opened the bag to see what could be so heavy. I grasped the torn edge of the plastic and peeled it back slowly, half-expecting to see nothing but a soggy mess. A scruff of matted hair emerged from the opening I had made. 

My blood ran ice cold, and I stopped breathing. The hair wasn’t just some stray clump; it was attached to a small, pale face pressed against the inside of the plastic. Eyes closed, mouth slack, utterly still. Slowly, I forced myself to pull the bag open wider, revealing the form of a child curled in a fetal position. Then another. And another.

I think I stood over these bags for minutes, the weight of what I’d just discovered slamming into me so suddenly that I shut down completely. My mind went blank, my body froze, and I couldn’t force myself to move or think clearly. Then, just as suddenly, the numbness shattered. A crushing wave of fear and anxiety crashed over me, tightening my chest and sending cold sweat down my spine

 

What the fuck was I going to do?

 

I opened my phone, instinctively wanting to call triple 0, but I stopped. Something in me stopped me from calling the police. An instinct I couldn’t explain. Instead of calling the police, I dialled my manager’s number.

The phone rang a few times before he picked up.

“Oh, hey buddy,” he said, his voice heavy with exhaustion. “What’s up? Did one of the microwaves give out on you or something?” 

“You need to get over here right now. I found something in the storeroom.”

There was a pause on the other end. Then he answered, his tone low and clipped, almost annoyed.

“Look, dude, it’s probably just some old trash or a busted freezer. Don’t go stirring up trouble where there isn’t any.”

“No, I’m serious, you need to get over here right now.”

I heard a massive groan come from the other end before,

“Fine, I’ll be there in 15.”

He abruptly hung up.

15 minutes had never felt so long. It was like time had slowed to a crawl, each second dragging behind the last. The air inside the restaurant felt different now. Thick, oppressive. Like the place knew  what was hidden in the back. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting everything in that sickly yellow glow, and the hum of the fridge seemed louder than usual, like it was trying to fill the silence. But it didn’t. Nothing could. I kept checking the front window, waiting for his car to pull up. My heart thudded against my ribs the whole time, my thoughts racing in circles.

Eventually, his car pulled up.

He looked rough. Worse than usual. Oily skin. Red, sunken eyes. No effort was made to hide how tired, or maybe strung out, he was.

The fake cheer from our first meeting was gone.

“This better be important,” he snapped. “Or you’re getting a warning.”

“I’m not joking,” I said, my voice barely steady. “Go look in the storage room”

He rolled his eyes like I’d told him we were out of napkins. He made his way into the storage room while I waited next to the till.

“Geez, look, kid, I know the smell is bad, but there's no reason to-”

“what the fuck?” 

“WHAT THE FUCK?”

He stumbled back into view, gripping the doorframe like he might fall.

“I told you,” I said quietly.

“You told me you found something. Not that you found three fucking kids.”

He stared at me, wild-eyed, panic creeping in like smoke through the cracks.

“why the fuck did you call me for this?

“I didn’t know what else to do,” I said. My voice felt like it belonged to someone else. “I couldn’t just call the cops. They’d think it was me. I needed someone to see.”

He stared at me. And for a long time, he said nothing.

Then, softly

“We need to get rid of them.” 

“What?”

He ran a hand through his greasy hair, pacing.

“The company is in enough trouble as it is; if the public were to find out about this, the place would get shut down. We’d lose our jobs.”

“You want me to help you cover this up? After what I just saw?”

“We have to make a choice,” he said quietly, voice barely above a whisper. “If this gets out… It’s not just the jobs on the line. It’s everything. The owners, the suppliers… everyone connected to this dump.”

I swallowed hard, trying to keep my nausea at bay. “And you think hiding it will make it go away?”

“What else is there? You call the cops, and this place turns into a crime scene. Investigations, headlines. We’re out of work, sure, but it’ll be months, maybe years, before they figure out who did it. And if they do...”

His voice trailed off, but the message was clear. Nobody wanted to be the fall guy. Nobody wanted the shame.

I glanced at the bags again, at the tiny, broken lives packed away like garbage. I wanted to scream. To run. But there was only one way I could fix this nightmare.

“Okay,” I finally said, the word tasting like poison. “If we’re doing this... we need a plan.”

“We clean up. We get rid of the bags. No evidence. No witnesses. And we keep our mouths shut.”

I nodded slowly, feeling the last shreds of my soul crumble. Somewhere deep inside, a small voice whispered that this was wrong. But fear had wrapped itself tight around me.

I grabbed the first garbage bag, still slick with that awful smell. The plastic stretched taut as I lifted it, and my stomach churned violently, but I kept my face blank. He followed close behind, his footsteps echoing in the silence.

We pushed the door open, it groaned on its rusty hinges, letting in a cold, damp draft from outside. The back area was a small concrete area shared between the pizza shop and the hairdresser next door. The smell hit me again, sharper against the open air, mixing with the scent of damp concrete and rotting leaves.

Directly ahead sat the massive green garbage container, the kind you see outside every fast food joint. The road behind the strip mall curved gently right toward the main road. From here, the headlights of cars occasionally spilled light over the grimy concrete. The road also led to an underground car park for the nearby hardware store, its neon sign shut off for the night. Beyond that was a creak that separated the strip mall from residential areas.

But we were alone. No one could see what we would do from back here.

The manager left the bodies with me while he grabbed his car. I stood there, with the bags as if I were just taking out some trash. It made me sicker. He came back, he backed the car up beside the dumpster, keeping the engine running. The trunk popped open with a mechanical click. We didn’t speak. We didn’t look at each other. We lifted the bags, one by one, and loaded them into the trunk like sacks of flour. Their weight was wrong. Too heavy for something so small.

When we were done, he closed the trunk, wiped his hands on his pants, and turned to me.

“Clock in like normal tomorrow. Close the store for the night. Go home.”

Then he turned and walked to his car.

I watched his taillights disappear around the bend of the strip mall

I guess he was taking care of the rest.

I never asked what he did with the bodies. I didn’t want to know. Maybe he drove them out past the hills and buried them beneath some half-collapsed shed on an old property no one visits anymore. Maybe they’re still in the trunk of his car, driving with him wherever he goes.

The next night, I clocked in.

No one said anything. The store was quiet. I went to the back. The storeroom was wide open now, and everything had been scrubbed clean and wiped down. New lights were installed, and they illuminated the entire room. It smelled fresh.

So it was business as usual. I microwaved pizza. I stayed until 5 AM. And when I left, I made sure the back door was locked.       

The manager greeted me with that same chipper voice the next time I saw him.

“How’re ya going, bud?”

He seems fine. Better at pretending than I am.

I’m still working here. I guess I’ll be getting promoted soon. He says he likes my work ethic.

Maybe he just knows I can keep a secret.
