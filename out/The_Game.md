“Fuck that job!” I said, slamming my truck door. I had been stuck at that damn job, working green chain for years. While Tom, that bastard, secured the promotion for his little brown-nose buddy, who had only been there for a year.

 I stepped up to my small, two-bedroom house, left to me by my parents, nestled in the mountains with an acre of land. As I entered my house, thankful to be home and out of the rain, I take off my boots and hop into the shower. 

My home is still decorated with my mom’s designs, floral wallpaper, and antique furniture. I needed to change that soon; my house looked like a nursing home. After finishing the shower, I dried off and went to warm up my dinner. 

My meal consisted of pizza rolls, paired with Diet Lipton green tea, mixed berries. What? Just because I live in the mountains and am a country boy, does that mean I’m supposed to drink beer or whiskey? Nah, I liked my tea.
After finishing my meal, I settled into my living room to watch my favorite anime, Konosuba. 

Staying up a little later than usual because I was calling off tomorrow… Screw that job. Maybe I will head to the next town, grab some fast food, and binge more anime. Glancing at the clock, I saw it was nearly midnight. Turning off the TV, I cleaned up my mess, and started walking toward my room. 

As I was about to leave the living room, I heard a knock at the door. Who would knock at this hour, this far out? I opened it to find two kids standing on my porch. They were both blonde, wearing worn-out blue jeans and shirts that looked like they were from the 70s. 

Neither made eye contact; they simply looked down or stared off to the side. “Hello, sir! May we come in? It’s cold out here, and we don’t have a phone,” One of them said. I raised an eyebrow. “How did you get here? Nobody lives close to here.” 

They grabbed each other's hand. “We walked, of course!” they said in unison. Well, that was vague as hell, I thought to myself. “I’ll call someone for you, but I can’t let you inside.” Even though they were looking down, I could see a slight smile on their faces.

They didn’t respond. “Wait here, I’ll make a call.” Both of their heads snapped up to look at me simultaneously. That’s when I saw it—inky black eyes, devoid of any humanity, that sent a chilling wave down my spine and a sick, icy dread surging through my body. 

“Thank you!” they said again in unison, their voices smooth and mechanical, yet eerily resonant. “Wanna play a game?” The words hung in the air, each syllable sending a fresh shiver down my spine. Creepy-ass kids. “Nah!”

 I slammed the door shut and hurried to the kitchen to use the landline. We don’t get good cell service up here. Picking up the phone to call the sheriff, but on the other end was nothing but silence. What the hell? I paid the bill, and the phone never goes out up here.

I went back to the door to tell them I’d give them a ride to the sheriff’s station, but they were gone. Huh. Well, I’m sure they’ll be fine. Walking into the bathroom, I started brushing my teeth. Rinsing my mouth out, I looked into the mirror and saw the two kids behind me. 

I turned sharply, about to confront them, but they were gone. My heart pounded as I quickly left the bathroom, searching the house for them, but they were nowhere to be found. Standing in my living room, feeling a mix sensation of creeped-out and angry, the phone started ringing. 

I picked it up, and heard their voices again: “The game started when you opened the door. Fall asleep before sunrise, and you will have lost.”
They said it in unison, their creepy voices sending chills down my spine. 

Then they hung up. How the hell did they get this number? Grabbing my flashlight, I went outside to see if they were hiding somewhere. First thing I noticed was that my truck tires were flat. 

Pissed off, I pulled out my cell phone and walked around to the side to see if I could get a weak signal. Holding it up, I scanned for service. Out of the corner of my vision, I saw them—both of them—staring at me from my bedroom window, their unnaturally wide grins stretching impossibly across their pale faces.

 A cold chill ran down my spine as their eyes seemed to gleam with something darker, something far more sinister. I jumped back, my heart pounding violently in my chest, dread seeping into every part of me.
 
Sprinting inside, desperate to catch them, but when I reached my room, they were gone. Standing there alone, I sensed something was off. The lights dimmed then flickered, casting eerie shadows across the walls, and the house felt comfortably warm, like the breath of some mid spring. 

Fatigue clawed at my senses, yet I fought it off. Snatching a Red Bull from the fridge, a desperate attempt to stay awake. Screw it—just four more hours until sunrise. Sitting back on the couch, I turned on my anime and took a long gulp from the energy drink. Two more sat in the fridge. 

That should be enough. Around the second episode, the lights flickered and dimmed even further, casting the room into a suffocating, oppressive gloom. My eyelids grew heavier, pulling me into a sleep I fought desperately to resist. 

“I know you’re feeling sleepy,” a whisper hissed in my ear, sending a chill down my spine. “Nuh uh!” I gritted my teeth, forcing myself to stay awake and cling to the flickering images on the screen. 

My vision blurred, the world spinning slightly. The floor beneath my feet shifted, unstable like shifting sand, and I nearly collapsed, catching myself just in time. I glanced at the clock—5 a.m. Only an hour and a half until sunrise, and I would win this twisted game.

Suddenly, I looked to the left and froze. Four inky black eyes peered out from around the hallway corner, watching me with a chilling stillness. My heart pounded against my ribs, and I jump up then stumbled forward, swaying on unsteady feet.

 “Shit, if you creepy kids want to win, try not going with the stupid jump scares.” I hissed through gritted teeth, my voice trembling. Now that I was up, I hurried into the kitchen, grabbing another Red Bull.

 Sitting back down on the couch, I tried to focus on the screen, but my head spun and swam. My eyelids fluttered shut, only to snap back open, but my body betrayed me. 

My head dropped back, and when I looked again, the two kids were standing right beside me, their gaunt faces inches from mine. Their expressions were different now—there was sadness, a haunting, hollow sorrow behind their inky black eyes.

 “You will not win. No one ever wins,” they murmured in unison, their voices a ghostly whisper that sent a shiver crawling down my spine.

Their icy hands pressed me back into the couch with an unnerving gentleness, as if my struggle was irrelevant. The girl began to sing a hauntingly beautiful melody, each note twisting through my mind like a sinister lullaby. 

My head spun, vision blurring, as the melody seeped into my thoughts, dragging me deeper into a sense of helplessness. I fell back on the couch, staring up at the ceiling. The edges of my vision darkened, fading into an abyss. 

Suddenly, a cold hand appeared from the corner of my vision, pressing my eyelids shut, sealing me into darkness. I jolted awake, gasping, sitting upright and frantically scanning the room. 

Was that a dream? I checked the clock—it was 2 p.m. Shit, I’d forgotten to call out. Oh well, I’d call in a bit. Walking slowly to the bathroom, a strange feeling settled over me. 

My clothes felt looser, and I felt numb—like something vital inside me had been stripped away. Brushing my teeth, I paused when I caught my reflection. My features were wrong. I looked younger, smaller, but the most terrifying shift was my eyes—they were black.
