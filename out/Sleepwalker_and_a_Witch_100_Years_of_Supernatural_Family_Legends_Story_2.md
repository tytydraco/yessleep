My great-grandmother was the most beautiful girl in her village. In a village where everyone had black or brown hair and dark or brown eyes, the girl with green eyes and blond hair was like something from another universe. All the boys were in love with her, and the women dreamed that she would become their daughter-in-law.

In 1924, when she turned 13, they began to get invoy with her. In those days, girls were married at the age of 13-14, and boys were married at 15-16. Despite the large number of matchmakers from different families, her father refused everyone, claiming that she was still young. My great-great-grandfather had seven daughters, and all of them except my great-grandmother were already married by that time.

Among the matchmakers there was one case that stood out. Usually women came to wory, but one day a 45-year-old man came. My great-great-grandfather received the guest with all honors, but when he found out that this man came to ask for his daughter's hand for himself, he angrily kicked him out of the house, warning him that if he ever looks at his daughter, he would be left without eyes, and if he came up and touched her, he would be left without limbs.

A week later, the man was seen in the village again, but he did not approach to my great-grandmother and did not see her. They said he was come to some old woman.

One of the days, when the great-grandmother was returning from a walk with her best friend Alia, an old woman joined them. The girls were terrified of her, because they knew that she was famous as a witch. She talked to them with a smile, praised their beauty, especially my great-grandmother. When she stroked great-grandmother's head, touchingly, she felt a small prick on her neck, but did not pay attention to it.

That evening, when the great-grandmother was sleeping in her room (her parents were gone, they went to the neighbors), she heard someone's whisper. Someone's female voice was calling her, and she woke up. When she woke up, she looked around, but didn't see anyone.

"Get up," suddenly a whisper was heard again, and she automatically got up. Despite her open eyes and awareness of what was happening, the great-grandmother felt like in a dream. She didn't get up by herself. Suddenly her legs started moving. She opened her closet, put on a beautiful white dress and took a white veil with her. She was terrified inside. She saw her body moving by itself, and there was nothing she could do about it. It seemed to her that it was some kind of terrible dream.

After getting dressed, she went out the gate of the house and headed towards her friend Alia's house. When she reached the gate, she stopped. Her hand went up and knocked on the gate. Alia came out. She was surprised what the my great-grandmother was doing here and why she dressed up. Great-grandmother's lips automatically came into motion, and she said she was getting married. Deep inside the great-grandmother was terrified, she wanted to scream, ask for help, but her mouth did not move. Alia was also shocked and asked if she was joking. Great-grandmother spoke again, explaining that her parents agreed and she is now going on a nikah with a man. She needs a witness for this. Alia was shocked, but great-grandmother's voice persuaded her that everything is fine and they need to go now. Alia asked where to go, and her great-grandmother said she would show her the way.

Alia was still shocked by what she heard, so she asked great-grandmother to wait and went back home. She went out with her older brother. She explained his presence by the fact that it's dark now and someone needs to see them off. Alia's brother was a tall and strong 14-year-old boy.

They walked silently. Alia's brother carefully watched how great-grandmother walks and behaved. Great-grandmother tried her best to stop, scream, but there was a smile and calmness on her face.

They walked for about 15 minutes until they reached the house with a high gate. Great-grandmother's hand went up and knocked on the gate. A woman opened them and invited guests. Alia looked at her brother. He nodded, and they came in. After passing through the courtyard, they entered the house, in one of the rooms there was a mullah (priest), another stranger and a 45-year-old man, who had come to court her a couple of days ago. Great-grandmother was terrified. He was dressed in the groom's traditional clothes. Mullah asked the guests to pass and sit in front of the groom. Alia's brother looked around all this, apologized, said that he was going home on business and would come back when it was all over.

Alia's brother left, and the great-grandmother and Alia entered the room and sat down opposite the men. Mulla started the process of nikah, the great-grandmother begged God inside to save her. Alia looked at her, then at the groom with and his witness.

Having finished with all the preliminary words, the mullah, as usual, asked if my great-grandmother took this man as her husband. No matter how much she tried to refuse, no matter how much she shouted the words "No" inside herself, her lips agreed. Then the mullah asked the groom, and he also agreed. Declaring them husband and wife, the mullah gave the groom a bowl of water. He drank from it and gave it to the bride. The bride took a sip of water and handed the bowl back to the mullah. Mullah read the last prayers, congratulated them and left the room. The groom escorted the mullah to the gate with his witness and returned alone. He asked Alia to go home, as he and my great-grandmother needed to "consolidate their marriage".

Alia was confused, she didn't know what to do. She wanted to talk to great-grandmother, but great-grandmother told her that everything was fine, and she could safely go home. The great-grandmother's face still had a smile and calmness, but with one nuance - her eyes were brown.

Alia, breathing heavily, reluctantly left the room. Closing the door, a man with a lustful look came up and sat down with my great-grandmother. She wanted to close her eyes out of fear, but she couldn't. He took off her white veil and started undressing her. His breath was nasty and foul-smelling, he was excited, but he was not in a hurry.

Great-grandmother began to pray to herself. 
A loud bang of the door hitting the wall, Aaliya's brother bursts into the room, dragging the old witch by her hair. He throws her to the floor and goes up to the man. Before the man can even get up, he gets punched in the nose and falls down. "Another punch, and he goes unconscious. Aaliya's brother crouches down and looks into the great-grandmother's eyes. Then he goes over to the old witch, grabs her by the hair, and drags her to the great-grandmother, throwing her down next to her."

"Fix it now?" he says.

"What? What are you talking about?" says the old woman.

"Don't play innocent here" said Aaliya's brother. "You saw them today. You're fuckin witch and you touched her. She has green eyes, but now they're the same color as yours, with the same spot on the iris. So either fix her or it will get worse."


Alia enters the room in tears. The old woman laughed. "Or What?" - before she could say it, the knife stuck into her thigh, and she screamed. Alia's brother pushed it so deeply that he came out from the other side.

"Fix it, NOW!" he said, twisting the knife to the left. The old witch felt unbearable pain and screamed, "A needle! There's a needle on the back of her head!"

"Aaliya ran to great-grandmother, tilted her head, and removed the needle. As soon as the needle was out, the smile and calm on the great-grandmother's face were replaced by a grimace of pain and fear, and she screamed at the top of her lungs. Aaliya embraced her, and they both cried. The great-grandmother got up and, in a fit of rage, began kicking the old witch in the face. Aaliya's brother calmed her down and, leading them out, walked them home.


Here’s the text translated into conversational English:

The whole village hears about it. The next day, the man shows up with a mullah and a witness, claiming that my great-grandmother is his lawful wife and that he wants to take her back. The mulla confirm his words. My great-great-grandfather is furious but keeps his cool. Calmly, in front of the neighbors, he says he won’t give his daughter to anyone, no matter what anyone says. The man insists that he has "sealed the marriage" with her. She’s not a virgin. Aaliya’s brother steps in, saying he broke the suitor’s nose before he even touched her and the only thing he did with his dick was piss himself. The man won’t back down, saying he won’t grant her a divorce and any of her relationship with another man would be illegal and sinful for her.


"My great-great-grandfather doesn’t say anything. He takes my great-grandmother and her mother into the house and steps outside with a bundle. Suddenly, there are cries, screams, and a heartrending male groan coming from the street. My great-grandmother rushes outside and sees her suitor lying in a pool of blood, without arms or legs. She is horrified and, looking at her father, sees him holding an Arabic curved sword, a family heirloom. All the neighbors gathered around are in shock

"You wanted to say something" my great-great-grandfather says to the groom.

"Forgive me! Forgive me! I'm sorry!!!!!" - he screams, writhing in pain.

"And?" said the great-great-grandfather.

"I gave the money to the witch! I asked her to blur your head!! Help me, please! It hurts!!" he shouted.

"Good boy" - said the great-great-grandfather and with one swing of the sword, he cleaves off the top of the head right along the line of the eyes. 


Everyone is horrified. The groom falls dead. My great-great-grandfather methodically wipes the blade clean on the man's clothing.

"Now my daughter is a widow and she doesn't need a divorce from you," said the said the great-great-grandfather..

Alia's brother tells my great-great-grandfather that he will take care of body. On the same evening, the old witch's house caught fire. As soon as the fire is extinguished by firefighters and neighbors, the police find the charred body of a woman and a body without a head and limbs in it. None of the neighbors reported the incident to the police.

My great-grandmother took a long time to recover from this. She often had nightmares about that day. Her parents helped her through this trauma, along with Aaliya, and her brother, who married my great-grandmother and loved and protected her until the end of his days
