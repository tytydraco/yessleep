Recently, I have noticed a new type of horror made popular. A phenomenon of empty abandoned places that while they used to be for a lack of a better word, vibrant, now sit in silence. This is called Liminal spaces and it is relevant to my current situation. A situation or  story if you could call it that, that I am currently  living. A living nightmare that involves this phenomenon. A story about nostalgia and my childhood home.

Every one of my memories involve this house in some way or another. Birthday party's, family functions, sleep overs, etc. This house has a big nostalgia hold on me, you could say. So, when I was back in town visiting my parents. I noticed that house was up for sale. Apperently it had been empty and up for sale for a while now. So, I made a offer on the house. 

I was pretty financially stable, and was looking for a better living situation than the studio apartment I was living in. I got the call, the house was mine. I went over to sign some paperwork and it was official. It felt amazing to finally own my own house, and I felt overwhelming nostalgia when I walked in through the front door. It looked exactly the same, just now empty. I do admit it felt a bit creepy, to walk through the house, in complete silence. Every room looking... overwhelmingly bland.

For now, I had a sleeping bag and my phone. My stuff from a state over was still being shipped to me. It would just be me in this empty house with nothing for now. When night rolled around, it felt unreal. Walking through the different rooms, remembering all the different memorys. It still felt creepy, like someone watching me. Soon that feeling would become reality.

It started by showing up in my dream... or what I thought was a dream. After I fell asleep I was in the house, in the hallway of the second floor. . It looked the same.. but different at the same time. I had that feeling again of being unsettled, and it was amped up by my nostalgia. Suddenly, I heard my mom call out to me. I walked downstairs, and all of a sudden the house turned distorted. It felt like a million eyes on me, and I took a glance behind me. Two figures were running towards me, and as I tried to run it felt like my legs were weighed down and then I fell down. I tried to get up but I couldn't, it was like one hundred boulders were on my hands and feet. The figures caught up to me as I was trying to crawl away, they looked like my mom and dad. But they had no eyes and unnatural smiles. They plunged knives through my back, and I looked up. I saw a third figure I didn t recognize standing and watching, behind my distorted parents. 

I woke up screaming and holding my chest as I sat up. My heartrate went down when I realized it was just a dream. I forgot how real some dreams could feel, but this felt different in some way I couldn't explain. I glanced at my watch, and it was 6:36 a.m. I had a hour before, I was suppost to meet my parents at one of the local diners for breakfast 

I grabbed some clothes from the bag, I had with me, changed and headed out of the house. When I stepped out, I was back on the second floor. I was confused, was I still dreaming? I couldn't be, but how was I back on the second floor? I tried to leave the house again, but it was the same, except I heard that same voice of my mother again. This time distorted.

>distorted voice of my mom: "Time for school,  brian"

As I heard it, I rushed down the hallway and hurried downstairs. They were in pursuit, and when I thought I finally got away my legs felt weak and I couldn't run anymore. I would then fall down. This time though, they took their time. Slowly walked towards me as I tried to crawl away. I was crying, the fear I felt I had never felt before. The third figure would always be watching from distance. Then I would be grabbed, and I would feel sharp pains through my chest. I would wake back up on the second floor, and it went on and on. It was my own personal fucking hell. Each time the figure closes its distance on me. It was smiling, im scared what will happen when it reaches me. I've tried to fight back, but my arms are useless. Everything I do, it always ends the same.

I have been trying to find anyway to escape, they find me each time. Even if I try to hide, it's no use. My watch says 5:00 p.m in the afternoon. I know I'm not dreaming, or atleast if I am this is a very elaborate dream. I was able to close the door on them, but somehow they get in. But I figured out how to pause the limbo sorta, for a short period of time. I was able to stay in one of the second floor rooms, for atleast a little while without anything happening. During that time,  I was able to type this out. 

Whatever you do, don't buy your childhood home.
