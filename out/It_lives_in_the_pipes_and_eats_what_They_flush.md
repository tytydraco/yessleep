I used to think the worst part of working nights at a men’s gym would be the blood, or maybe the piss. Turns out, I was way off. Blood you get used to. Piss became simple background noise. 
What I didn’t expect, and what I could never have prepared for, was the thing in the sewers. The thing that feeds off man juice. 

Yeah. I said it.

This isn’t some metaphor or gross-out creepypasta. This is real. This thing is alive, and growing fast. Faster than any creature I’ve seen. Every time some nasty-ass man jerks it in the gym bathroom stall and flushes the evidence, the damn thing gets stronger. Bigger. Smarter.
I think it’s learning to crawl up.


The disturbances started with the clogs. 

My job at the gym is cleanup. I’m the janitor. Super glorious I know. I work the third shift. 
10 PM to 6 AM. I clean shit most people keep out of sight & out of mind. 
Used condoms, used needles, puddles of testosterone manifested as swampy ponds of sweat. 

A lot of the guys would come into the bathroom, vanish into stalls for twenty minutes, then come out sniffling & red-faced, leaving behind nothing but towels or sticky toilet paper filled with shame and filling the bathroom with a stench of desperate sadness. 
And the gym toilets? They were different. They didn’t just clog, they gurgled. Like something below them was drinking it all in; eagerly and with gusto. 

At first I thought it was sewage backup, but I started noticing a pattern. 
First off, it was only the men’s room. 
And only after certain guys used it. 
The ones who’d walk in with gym bags and leave looking ten pounds lighter, flushed and dazed like they’d lost more than just fluids. 
The ones who’d disappear into stalls with their phones and not come out for thirty minutes.
One night I got curious. Big mistake.

Around 3 AM, the gym was mostly empty. I heard the familiar slurp of the far-left stall. Someone had obviously used it and flushed. I gloved up, walked across the gym into the bathroom, into the stall, and opened the lid.

The water was gone. All of it. Not drained, sucked. The bowl was bone dry and shiny: like someone had oiled it.
Next the smell hit me. 

Not shit. Not piss. Something worse. Like a hospital linen chute full of old towels, bleach, and crusty body fluid from a silver flood in a teaching hospital. Mix that with the smell of a PlannedParenthood waiting room. And you’re close. 
Sharp. Sweet. Rotted.

That’s when I saw it—just a glimpse. Something pale, pinkish-grey, slick with slime, retreating down the curve of the drain. It looked like an elongated, albino giraffe tongue. Or a pretty fucked up tentacle. I swear to God it shuddered when the overhead lights flickered.
I thought I was hallucinating. I even tried to write it off as sleep deprivation. Until the next night.

The gym was quiet all throughout my shift. Just me that night. Alfonso had ducked out early to smoke a blunt and drink 40s with Eleanor the cashier at the 7/11 next door. 
Just me. 
A quiet gym, I’m scraping gum and something I don’t wanna know what off the shower floor when I hear it again. 
The deep gurgling. 
The same stall… it had to be. 
But unlike usual, it didn’t stop after the flush. 
As I set my tools down and stood up, I heard a splash. Not a little one. A massive one. Like someone dropped a whole Thanksgiving turkey into a kiddie pool.
The sound of heavy, beleaguered breathing was all I could hear after the sound of the water hitting the floor. 
Wet, syrupy respiration. Like something thick and coated in mucous was exhaling through a straw.
I stepped out of the shower room and stopped cold.

The stall door was open. A trail of what looked like thick, cloudy sputum oozed from the bowl to the tile, where it pooled in little uncomfortably white globs like someone sneezed out an entire soul. In the bowl itself, the water bubbled—just a few blips at first, then violently, like a pot left too long on the burner.
Before I knew what was happening, something began reaching out of the toilet drain. 
A hand.

It wasn’t human. It had far too many knuckles. Skin like chewed-up foreskin. Long, writhing fingers reached out; tipped with little suction cups like an octopus trying to mimic the elegant form of the human hand but it had gotten it dreadfully wrong. 
It gripped the rim of the bowl, squelched violently, and slowly pulled something else upward.
I didn’t wait to see what it wanted to expose. 
I just ran. I didn’t clock out. I didn’t lock up. I ran out the emergency exit, into the alley, and hopped the back fence. I immediately turned and puked behind the Panda Express dumpster, as if I had just come face to face with God’s forbidden premier chimera. 

I called in sick the next night. And the one after that.
But guilt brought me back. That gym is in the middle of a major downtown area. Hundreds of people use it every day, if not thousands, and almost two thirds of that traffic flows through at night too. If some powerfully malevolent & disgustingly wet Splooge Monster is crawling up through the sewer to get a taste of whatever sweaty gym bros are flushing…
I couldn’t just let them get tainted. 

So, feeling like United States Senator Larry Craig, I set up a camera in the gym’s men’s bathroom. 
Hidden directly under the sink. Motion-activated. I figured it would catch maybe some weird plumbing stuff. Maybe a raccoon or something, right?
I was deluding myself, still attempting to convince myself I had hallucinated everything. 
Those efforts were futile, of course. 

I watched the footage the next morning after biscuits and gravy & my morning Red Bull. 
The next meal for the creature came from a behemoth. Big dude. Shirtless. Walked into the stall with a phone, stayed for about ten minutes. You could hear his “happy time,” gross, squelchy sounds, heavy breathing, skin slapping skin. I won’t describe much more than that. It was gross. I felt gross. I can’t believe I listened to that shit.  
He flushed, stood up, wiped his hands on his shorts, and walked out.

Then… silence. For about thirty seconds.
BUBBLE. GURGLE. SLORP.
The bowl emptied fast.
I saw it again.
This time the camera caught it clearly.
It rose up from the pipes. Tall. Thin. Dripping with white slime. Its body was translucent, almost the texture of jelly, but laced with dark, vein-like tendrils. No eyes. No mouth. Just a pulsing mass of orifices, some opening and closing like gills, the others twitching like they were hungry.
No eyes, but in my gut I felt like it could see me, even the next day watching the footage, straight through the camera. 
At the center of its chest, something glowed. Faintly. Like a core.
I paused the footage.
It wasn’t just glowing. It was moving. Like a heart. And it was full of floating… things.
Little white dots. Thousands of them.
It dawned on me what they were and my breakfast evacuated itself into the trash.

It wasn’t eating semen.
It was collecting it. Storing it.
Breeding with it.


I quit the next day.
Didn’t even give notice. Just sent an email and blocked the manager’s number.
But I couldn’t get it out of my head. I immediately began research. Sewer mutants, folklore, cryptids. Nada. 
There’s nothing on this thing. No name. No warnings. Like I’m the first person who ever saw it.

Or maybe I’m just the first person who didn’t cum and go: the first man to not be caught in its spell. 
I haven’t told anyone until now. I haven’t needed or wanted to.  
But last night… something happened.
I was in my apartment. Fourth floor. Miles & miles from that gym.
I flushed the toilet and that’s when I heard that fucking sound again. 

That heavy, mucous-laden, beleaguered breath.
Followed by something new…  
A whisper, barely audible over the hum of the fan.

“More…”

I’ve been peeing in bottles and shitting in the alley since that night. 
How can I ever use a toilet again?
