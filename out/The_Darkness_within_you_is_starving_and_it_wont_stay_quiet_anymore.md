"Friday, last day of work, the first day of a weekend, supposed to be anticipated, finally, time to relax.

That's funny, i used to feel that way, i used to dread mondays, on sunday i would start feeling down, knowing that i wouldn't be able to play games and do nothing for the next 5 days.
I loved playing video games, they let me escape my shitty life for atleast a moment.
Only good thing about mondays was that my girlfriend would be here.
She goes back to her home town every weekend, leaving me alone, with my thoughts.
Before, i could handle it, no biggie, two days of eating junk food and playing games, with just the occasional intruisive thought here and there.

But that was before.

 See, ever since i started to hear it, hear this, this **voice**, things have been going downhill.
My name is Paul, and i struggle with OCD.

I live in a flat in Warsaw. It is a bit small, i have to admit, but for a student like me it is enough.
And to be fair, the rent was really low for a place located right near the city centre.
I live at the fourth floor in apartment 36.
My neighbours are a bit weird, not really talkative, to be honest, i don't think i ever had a conversation with them, i haven't been seeing them much either.
They mostly stay inside, our interactions are limited to saying "hello" to each other when we run into them when we go shopping.

Since i am a bit shy, and embarassed to talk to others due to my illness, i used to be happy about this.
But nowadays, i wish i had someone, anyone, to talk to, _to help me find a way out of this mess_.

**But let's go back to the start.**

See, about a month ago, i started to notice something weird.
You know, OCD is already pretty awful to deal with, running routine checks around the house, checking if there is nothing hiding in the dark, if i turned off the oven, worrying about dying from every single small thing that i immediately assume is a deadly illness or injury.
But, this wasn't the usual boring stuff that i already grew used to, if you can call smoking a pack of cigs a day to get my mind off of it getting "used to it".

 At first, there were strange noises in the night, coming from what seemed like inside of my head.
I haven't given it much of a thought, i mean, my medications do sometimes cause hypnagogic hallucinations.
But it didn't end there, **oh boy, it did not end there.**
First time i heard those noises (which i can only describe as a low growling, kind of like a dog that smells someone he doesn't know, that he wants to scare away), must of been on the 11th of march, i remember feeling exhausted at work the next day, not sleeping that much due to the noise waking me up everytime i started to drift off into the dream world.

Ever since then, the noises have been getting louder and louder every night.

For the next couple of days things stayed relatively normal aside from the growling.

But then, on the 15th, it changed, i heard it call my name for the first time.
Seemingly my own voice, but twisted in a way, sounding strange to me.
My own voice sounded like i never heard it before.

_"Paul, did you check the stove?"_

Those were the words i heard in my mind.
I already had intruisive thoughts about the stove so this wasn't that unusual.
If it wasn't for the fact that it wasn't just a thought, it was a question.
A fucking question.
Not me asking if i checked it, nope, i **never** speak to myself in third person.

 Last week i went to work for the last time.
My boss told me she can't keep me around the customers, said that it would be bad for business.
I get it, i was going to quit eitherway.
_I don't trust myself around people anymore._

Two weeks ago my girlfriend broke up with me, couldn't handle it longer i guess, these rituals i do. I feel relieved that she hasn't went into the basement before leaving.
I am sure she would have called the cops on me if she knew.

_*"The monster will get you if you don't sacrifice the neighbours cat to him"*_

Fucking stupid right? Doing things you know are pointless and borderline insane but still needing to do them just to scratch that annoying itch that you feel inside of your head.
I hate ocd, i really do.

But well, what can i say, i can't control it at all, maybe my meds are too weak now.
I might have to up the dose.

A week after i started hearing it talk to me, i began to feel the need to do new rituals that i haven't had to do before.
Painting symbols on the walls with my blood (_~not always my blood~_), to ward off evil spirits.
Repeating the words "Te invito Zabulus" even though i don't know what they mean.
And much, much, more.

She told me that i don't need to get stronger meds but a priest.
I thought she was just tired of my antics but now i am not sure.

I mean, i do know that ocd goes in pair with impostor syndrome and i might just think that this is not ocd and instead something else even though it is just my illness, but, it all feels too real.

**I think we should come back to the present day.**

 I can't really control my body anymore, my hands do their own thing, my legs move when i don't want to move.
**I feel like i am a passive viewer in my life, watching things unfold.**
I do still have some resemblance of control, this isn't constant.
It comes in waves, i can be normal and suddenly i start to choke a random customer.

That's why i don't leave my house anymore.
I only go out when i need to, i order door dash when i can afford it and rest of the time i just don't eat.

My parents help as much as they can, they send me money for groceries.
My landlord told me that he will give me some time to get back up on my feet before charging me rent.

 But i don't think i can, the _**voice**_ won't stay quiet.
I hear it all the time, it speaks to me, tells me horrible things, stuff i wouldn't even imagine.
I am glad my girlfriend left when she did, before it got worse, or else, i don't think she would be alive today.

 I am gonna try to get some help, maybe i can still go back to being myself.

**Tuesday 4th, december 2025.**

 I haven't been able to do anything at all, i am a prisoner in my own mind.
This is the first time in what feels like ages where i have been in the drivers seat.
What has my life become?
_God, please, end this, if you are even there._


**Wednesday 25th.**

I can't take this any longer.
It went too far, it told my father that i always hated his guts, that i want him to die so that i can atleast get something from his will.
My parents cut off all the ties with me.
I have no more money, no support left.
**This might be the end of the road for me.**

 It told me its name, _~Waoavuvz~_.
It wants me to feel how it feels to lose everything. 
It feeds of my pain.
Said he loves to see me struggle to break out of my chains, to stop him.
How i am so fun to play with because i was so oblivious to his existence, how i tried to explain it all by just my illness getting worse.
I have nothing left, he took it all away.
Yesterday i almost killed my neighbour, she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I still don't know how i haven't been arrested.
My house is a mess, the smell of rot, mould, trash, dead rats.
It makes me gag, if only i could vomit, i would, but i can't, i lost my gag reflex after the fifth time i ate a cockroach stew.
My arms are covered in scars, runes cut into my body. I look like a witch from a scary movie.

 I want to die, i want to just, leave all of this behind, i dread waking up, not because i am safe in my dreams, i am not, it follows, **everywhere**.
I hate waking up because i can feel its claws digging into my shoulders, my soul, forcing me to do things against my will, forcing me to hurt people.

**January 1st. 2026.**


Silence, _deafing silence_, the presence that was so overwhelming, gone, nowhere to be found. But with it, so is gone the only reason i am still alive, _the lack of opportunity_.
I have nothing left, no friends, family, money, no job, i got kicked our of college.
My landlord told me i have 3 days to move out or she will call the cops on me.
My ex got married, guess she moved on pretty fast, no surprise there, i would want to forget about someone like me as fast as i can aswell if i was in here position.
My brother graduated and i wasn't invited to his graduation party. Apparently my parents want nothing to do with me.

I am ending it tommorow, i am sorry for making you aware of him.
You aren't safe, it won't be satisfied with me, it will come for you next.
Stay safe and don't give into his demands, these compulsions, they are the reason for why he could take control.

Goodbye, and, to my friends and family, please, don't forget me, the me you knew, the old me, love you, Paul."





 **Hi, i am Matt, those were the last pages of my brothers journal, i found it at his flat after his funeral.
