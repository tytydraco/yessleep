I rang the doorbell twice and waited. I was standing on the front porch of Jimmy’s house.

His family was relatively new to the neighborhood, having moved in only two months ago. They seemed friendly enough during our brief interactions—just your typical suburban American family.

So I wasn’t too surprised when his mom reached out and asked if I’d be willing to babysit him for the evening. They were offering $100, which was good money for a 15-year-old in my neck of the woods. It didn’t take me long to say yes.

I had heard whispers that Jimmy was a bit of a problem child, and truth be told, I’d never babysat a boy before. But how hard could it be? He was just a little kid, after all.

I was about to find out soon enough.

The door opened, and Jimmy’s parents greeted me warmly, inviting me inside. They introduced me to their 8-year-old son.

“Hi, Jimmy. I’m Kathy. Nice to meet you,” I said, shaking his hand. He gave me a sheepish smile before retreating to the sofa, where he resumed playing his video game.

Jimmy’s mom explained that she and her husband were heading to a concert and promised they’d be back by 10 PM. She assured me that her husband would drop me home when they returned.

She had already prepared dinner for Jimmy and asked me to reheat it in the microwave when needed. She also handed me some cash, suggesting I order whatever I wanted from the local restaurant.

Before leaving, Jimmy’s dad turned to him and said, “Listen, buddy. You’re going to behave yourself, okay?”

“When we get back, we expect Kathy to have only nice things to say about you. Got it?”

Jimmy nodded, barely glancing up from his game, and with that, his parents bid us goodbye and headed out for the evening.

Things were quiet for the next twenty minutes. Jimmy continued playing his game while I flipped through a magazine and chatted with my friends on my phone.

I glanced at Jimmy occasionally to keep an eye on him. He'd been well-behaved so far, keeping to himself. A few more minutes passed.

Then, I heard a small thud.

Jimmy had casually tossed his console onto the floor. He stretched his legs onto the coffee table, leaned back into the sofa, and interlocked his fingers behind his head. He was staring at me.

"I'm bored," he said.

I smiled and closed my magazine. "Would you like to watch some TV? Is there any cartoon or anime that you like?"

He twirled his toes and kept staring. "Dance for me."

"Excuse me?" I asked, taken aback.

"Dance. Sing. Do whatever you want." His lips curled into a smirk. "Mom and Dad are paying you to be here, right? So go ahead. Entertain me."

'You arrogant little twerp. Who do you think you are?' I thought to myself. But I couldn’t say that out loud—he was just a kid.

"Jimmy, didn't your parents teach you to be respectful to elders? I don’t appreciate the way you're talking to me," I said firmly. "If you're bored, I can turn on the TV or read you a story from your favorite book."

"Boring!" he groaned, rolling his eyes.

"What would you like to do then? Are you hungry? Shall I heat up the food your mom left for you?" I asked, trying to remain patient.

He turned to me and grinned. "Do you have a boyfriend?"

"No," I blurted before I could stop myself.

He smirked. "Ha. Thought as much."

For the first time, my face flushed with anger. I was trying hard to stay composed. This kid was really getting to me.

Jimmy got up from his seat. "On second thought, I'm hungry. Let’s order pizza."

He picked up the cordless phone and began dialing. I got up, walked over, and took the phone from his hand. "Your mom gave strict instructions not to order out. You’ll have to eat what she made."

"No, I won’t! And you can't force me!" he shouted, his face turning red.

I pulled out my phone. "I’m calling your dad. Your parents won’t be happy to hear about this."

Jimmy’s bravado faded. Realizing the consequences, he mumbled, "I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that."

"It's alright, Jimmy," I sighed. "Are you hungry?"

The little boy thought for a moment and then asked, “Is it ok if I can hug you?”

“Pleaseee..” he said, smiling sweetly with folded hands.

I smiled and nodded. The boy came forward and gave me a warm hug. 

And then I suddenly felt a searing pain in my body. Jimmy bit me in the arm and then quickly moved back. 

As I stood there rubbing my arm in shock, he came towards me again and this time grabbed my phone. He then ran across the hall, and threw it out the window.

“Jimmy!!” I yelled in anger. 

I opened the front door and peered outside. The phone landed in the garden, which was populated with all kinds of plants and shrubs. The place was also poorly lit. 

I turned back to look at him angrily. “You better stay put in your place. Or else you will be really sorry” I warned him. He took the hint and sat back on his chair. 

I then went out to search for my phone. I was crouched on all fours, combing the place with my hands in all that darkness, hoping I would somehow find it. 

A few moments passed by and then I heard the door slam shut. 

I started panicking and rushed back towards the door. 

As I got closer to the entrance, I heard a loud voice. It was not Jimmy’s. It sounded like a much older man. He was inside the house with Jimmy and was yelling at the top of his voice.

“Where is the money boy? Where has your father kept it?”, he roared

“Shut up. Stop crying. I am going to smack if you don’t stop now”, the man warned.

I could hear Jimmy crying and I began to panic. I started banging on the door. I was really worried about the boy’s safety. 

“Please I don’t know anything about that”, I heard Jimmy reply back. 

Then I heard something crash to the floor accompanied by the sounds of running footsteps from inside the house. 

 Jimmy was shouting “Help. Somebody please help me!!!”

 “Please no…. Leave me ….please….Aaaaaaghhh”

Jimmy was screaming at the top of his voice. Now even I started yelling from the outside while continuing to bang on the door. 

“JIMMY JIMMY!! …”. I cried.

Things suddenly went quiet. But it was only for a fleeting moment. 

And then I heard another crash at the back of the house. 

I ran back to see what happened. The back door was left open. I slowly tiptoed towards the door and peered inside.

 I couldn’t find anybody. I then rushed indoors towards the living room. 

And I saw Jimmy lying on the floor face down ….in a pool of his own blood!

I ran towards the boy in absolute panic and turned him over. 

I could not even figure out if he was dead or unconscious. I couldn’t even check his pulse because my hands were trembling. 

I got up to get to the phone. I dialled the number to call an ambulance. 

And then I heard that voice again….. This time, from behind me. .

“I am going to kill you”, he roared.

 I turned back in absolute horror thinking this was going to be the end of me. That this was it. In that moment my whole life flashed before me which made me feel sick to my stomach.

But as I turned I found myself looking at a giant TV screen with a picture of an angry man on it.

Then the picture came to life. The man on the screen started yelling again. 

Pause. 

He froze. 

Play. 

“I am coming for you”, he said. 

Pause. 

He froze again. 

With the phone still held to my ear, I slowly turned around to look where I found Jimmy lying on the floor. 

He was sitting upright on his knees with a TV remote in his hand, and an evil grin on his face.  

The obnoxious brat had been playing me all along.

Everything was fake. The attack, the cries for help,  the blood on his T-shirt… It was all fake!

“Why would you do this to me?” I asked him, unable to hide my helplessness. 

“Well… I saw the film Home Alone with my parents last month. I’ve been simply wanting to try this since then” he answered back, his lips curling into an evil grin. 

I was fighting back tears that were welling up inside me. 

But I didn’t want to give this kid the satisfaction of seeing me break down. The last thing I needed right now was him to start calling me a cry-baby. Deep down,  I really really wanted to spank that brat.

Then I heard a knock on the door.

“Hello there, is everything ok?”, I heard a voice from the outside. 

“This is Dominique, your neighbhor. We heard screams from your home” he said out loud.

“Is everything alright?” he asked as he continued to knock on the door.

I finally felt a tinge of relief. I have known Uncle Dominique since I was a kid and he was a kind man. 

I walked towards the door and opened it. 

He was standing with 3 other people. All were looking concerned. 

“Kathy? What are you doing here? What is going on?” he asked. 

Before I could reply, I saw his expression change from confusion to alarm. He just barged into the living room. 

When I turned back, I saw Jimmy slumped on the sofa, unconscious with blood stains all over his shirt. 

Dominique urgently patted him on the cheek and he remained unresponsive. He then sprinkled some water on his face and the boy slowly started to regain consciousness. 

I just stood there dumbstruck, watching the drama continue to unfold in front of me. 

“Where… Where am I?” Jimmy asked, trying to look all groggy and confused. 

“You are at home, my child. Are you ok? What happened?” Dominique asked, pointing to his clothes. 

I stepped forward to answer, “Uncle Dominique, it's all fine . He is just act…”

Dominique raised his hand and gestured me to keep quiet. He then asked another neighbhor to fetch a doctor who lived two houses away. 

Then the screaming started again. 

“She …she …is a MONSTER”, Jimmy yelled out loud with his finger pointed at me. 

“Keep her away from ME….. Please.. Please. .Please SIR”, he cried with his eyes closed, heavily leaning into Uncle Dominque with folded hands , almost as if begging him for his protection. 

All of them were staring at me now.

I could no longer control my tears. They were just flowing down my face. It was bad enough to be treated shabbily by this kid in private.

 But now people who I grew up knowing my entire life, were giving me looks like I was some kind of tyrant. 

I just wanted to get back home and hug my parents. I could not take this any longer. 

I ran towards the entrance and opened the front door, wide open and was shocked to suddenly see a policeman standing in front of me.

 ‘Did the neighbhors complain? Am I going to be arrested?’, I thought to myself as I struggled to control my pounding heart.

“Is this Jimmy's home” he asked me. I nodded. 

“Are you the babysitter Kathy?” he continued. I nodded again. 

He then asked, “Where is Jimmy?”

I slowly pointed my finger at the future Oscar winner. 

And for the first time, I saw genuine fear in his eyes. The little rascal finally realized he had gone too far.  

I quickly explained to the officer what happened and it didn’t take him long to believe me.

The little twerp couldn’t even look him in the eye. 

The officer then told me, “You both are coming with me to the station.”

Before I could put in another word, a couple of constables escorted me and Jimmy into the police car. 

“Why am I being taken to the station Officer?  I have done nothing wrong “, I protested. 

But I was only met with all round silence. 

Fear coursed through my veins once again as I sat in the police car, flanked by a couple of cops on either side, while Jimmy sat silently in the front. I could already picture myself spending the weekend in jail—charged with something like child cruelty or abuse, or whatever twisted accusation Jimmy was quietly brewing in his head.

But when we reached the place, I saw his parents in the station as well. And I was shocked to see them locked behind bars. They also looked oddly dressed in full black gear, very different from the classy attire they had worn for the concert.

Then on the table, I saw a shotgun and other semi-automatic weapons wrapped in evidence bags. The realization began to finally dawn on me!

These people were some kind of criminals!!

The officer walked up to me and said, “Jimmy's parents have been arrested for trying to rob a diamond merchant. They shot and injured people during the heist. So they will be going to prison for a long time.”

“I want you to sit with the boy until someone from Child Services can come and take care of him. Understood?” he asked. I nodded silently and glanced across the hall.

He was staring into an abyss and looked lost in his own thoughts. 

I could see that he was trying to grapple with the consequences of what was about to happen. His life was going to change completely from now on. 

I walked over and sat beside him.

And then gently wrapped my arms around him. 

He hugged me back and started crying inconsolably…
