Curiosity is a funny thing, isn’t it? It strikes without warning or logic. Or morals. But we can help you indulge your curiosity safely and cleanly, just follow these 9 simple steps, and that itch will finally be gone.  
**1. Make a friend**. Anyone will do, but better if they don’t have any other friends or close family. The more lonely they are, the easier it will be to approach them. Someone living alone in a house is best. If they are too resistant, move on to someone else, there are so many pathetic meat bags in the world.  


2. **Arrange a vacation**. Somewhere nice and sunny. Within driving range. Hype it up to your friends and family, show them pictures of the Airbnb you rented, and explain everything you plan to do there. It’s best if it is somewhere quiet.  


3. **Gather equipment**. This is where you get to be creative, you should buy everything out of town, as far as you're willing to go, and everything from separate shops. You have the necessities, like gloves, oil, and trash bags after you get those, use your imagination, don’t limit yourself to convention, axes may be mainstream but they don’t work for everyone.

4. **Leave on your vacation**. Make sure to say goodbye to your friends and family. Take time off work, even mention it casually to your acquaintances. Then pack your car full of all your nice new gear -beware of nosy neighbors- and drive out.  


5. **Drive back**  


6. **Prepare**. This is the moment of truth. Will you seize your opportunity, or try to crawl back into your vacuous life like a maggot you are? Imagine the feeling of blood through your gloves if you're having jitters. You haven’t felt a lot of it before, have you? No, and you never will if you don’t do it NOW.  


7. **Find the cat**. This is what you found them for, even if you pretended otherwise. Don’t feel bad, in the end, what else were they going to do with their mayfly minutes here? What makes their puny life more important than your curiosity? They’ll let you in, like the well-trained lamb they are.  


8.**Enjoy**. So much time and effort went into this moment, might as well savor it. Did you end up using an ax? Or poison? Poison is a favorite of novices. However you did it, enjoy watching the light run out of their eyes.  


9.**Cleanup**. Alas, any enjoyment comes with the inevitable mess. But you prepared for this, bleach the floor, remove any carpet you may have accidentally stained, and wrap up the cat and put it in your trunk. It has served its purpose. Then put some oil on the stove and set it alight. Drive away before the smoke begins rising from the house

On October 19th, 2023, 45 copies of a magazine were turned in to the police all across the US. The magazine had no title, just a blank black page at the front. The recipients of the magazine reported finding it on their front porch in the morning, with no mailing address. The article *The Curious and The Cats* was on the third page. The other articles were… similar.  
Since October 19th, 341 cases identical to those described in the magazine have been committed. The house of a recluse is burned in an oil fire, no body is found, but traces of blood or a struggle are evident. 51 perpetrators have been caught, and of those 43 admitted to having received the magazine. One repeatedly remarked on how he “should have upgraded to the premium subscription”.   


Yesterday, a new issue was released.
