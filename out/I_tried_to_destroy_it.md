You ever go to thrift stores or garage sales just to see what people have gotten rid of? Not what they own, but what they don’t want anymore. I find it oddly compelling. A t-shirt celebrating Deb’s divorce, a tie painted with the dancing baby gif, and what can only be described as a Christmas riding crop is just some of the nonsense I’ve found. Even found a full set of Le Creuset cookware for basically nothing once.

So one day I’m at an estate sale and I find this painting. It’s pretty motel generic, just a field of flowers and some fairies in it. But there’s something about it. I don’t know. I liked it. And it was a buck, so, why not? Take it home, hang it over my bed just like in a motel, and bob’s your uncle. 

That night I had this, I guess a nightmare. It started out nice enough. I was in this field, or I guess rolling hills, covered in all kinds of flowers, painting it in yellows and pinks and blues. There were these little people with butterfly wings. You know, fairies. And maybe a satyr somewhere playing a harp? I’m not sure why I think there was a satyr, but there was a harp. 

At first I’m just walking through this field. I’m taking in the sights while the fairies play and dance. I sniff a few flowers. When the fairies were playing ring around the rosie, where I was the rosie, I found this tulip and I thought it looked out of place. And I pick it. 

I don’t know what happened, but next thing I know I’m swarmed by those fairies, but they’re different. The color of their skin and hair and clothes had all washed out. And their teeth. Jesus, those teeth. You ever seen the inside of a penguin’s mouth? It’s like being stared down by satan’s angry vagina. That’s what these fairies had. 

One of the fairies bit my nose and I snapped awake with blood pouring out of my nose.

After I stopped the bleeding I put my sheets in the washing machine, went to work, and put the whole thing out of my mind. I put it so out of my mind that when I spent the night with the… OK, so she calls me her boytoy and I call her my girltoy. You ever had a girlfriend who insists on coming up with weird nicknames? That’s her. So I call her my girltoy. 

Anyways, I put the whole thing out of mind so much I didn’t even think to mention it. 

I didn’t go home that night because *girltoy*, but when I slept at home the night after, I had the same dream. Rolling hills covered in flowers, fairies playing, I swear a satyr I didn’t see was playing a harp, I pick a tulip, and the fairies go all gray and penguin mouthed, but this time one of them takes a bite out of my ear and I wake up with blood pouring out of it. 

One trip to urgent care later and I get a clean bill of health. The PA that examined me said he couldn’t find any cuts in my ear. He didn’t check, but he was pretty sure it was blood. He checked my nose too after I mentioned the fountain from it, but he didn’t find anything there either. 

This is when I realized something. Both times, the bleeding just stopped. It wasn’t like with nose bleeds or cuts I’ve had before where it slowed, then stopped. Open faucet one second, stopped the next. 

The girltoy was, let’s say, incredulous. When I finally left two days later she had managed to slip a few tampons in my bag. Not sure if she was teasing me or decided to try being helpful, but yeah, tampons.

Do you know how they check you if you piss blood? I’ll spare you the details, but probably the only thing worse then **that** is being told it was for nothing. 

Oh, the fairies bit my junk. Not sure if I mentioned that, but the fairies bit my junk and the next day I had blood in my urine and the urgent care couldn’t figure out why. Did get told I had a low iron count.

This is all clearly the fault of that painting. I don’t know what it is, or how it works, but it has to be the painting’s fault. There was a full within subject experiment. Yeah, I had a sample of one, but fuck you, I’m not putting anyone else through this. 

First I wanted to find out where this painting came from. It only took a few minutes on google to find the phone number of the house where I bought it. I spun a line about ‘a friend thinks they know who painted it’ and I wanted to find where the dearly departed got it. 

The family didn’t have an idea, but they said he got it a week before he died. Oh, and he kept getting aggressive nosebleeds after buying it, so, that’s great. 

I asked what happened (super awkward, wouldn’t recommend). They didn’t know exactly what happened, just that he woke up one day with a fever and nausea, had a hard time breathing, chest pain, and was convinced he was about to die. Like, full on panic attack “I am about to die”. They called 911, but he was dead before they got there. 

What is that, heart attack, maybe? 

Not sure it matters. 

What matters is I took it to an empty parking lot with some gasoline, paper towels, and a lighter and set it on fire. I stayed until there was just ash left, but when I got home, there it was, hanging over my bed like nothing happened. 

I took the painting to a different parking lot with some paint stripper and dumped the leftovers in a trashcan. That didn’t make any difference either. 

I chucked it in a river next and it stayed away that time. 

I stayed with the girltoy that night and didn’t have any nightmares. She told me I was being irrational and that I should sleep at my own place to prove it’s over. 

She was right, so I stayed at my apartment, and didn’t have any nightmares. 

But that makes me realize something: it must still be out there, somewhere. 

If you find it next, I’m sorry. I really am. I tried to destroy it.
