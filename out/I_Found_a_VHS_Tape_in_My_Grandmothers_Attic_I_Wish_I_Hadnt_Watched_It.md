When my grandmother passed away last month, I inherited her old house. It was a creaky, Victorian-style home that had been in our family for generations. The kind of place that smelled like dust and memories, with wallpaper that peeled at the edges and floors that groaned under every step. I hadn’t been inside since I was a kid, and even then, I always felt like the house was watching me.

Cleaning it out was a nightmare. Every corner was filled with relics from a bygone era—yellowed newspapers, moth-eaten dresses, and furniture that looked like it belonged in a museum. But it was the attic that held the real treasure trove. Or, as I would soon realize, the real nightmare.

The attic was a labyrinth of boxes and old furniture, all covered in a thick layer of dust. I was about to call it a day when I noticed a small, unmarked box tucked away in the corner. Inside was a single VHS tape. No label, no markings, just a plain black cassette. Curiosity got the better of me. I’ve always been a sucker for old media, and I figured it might be some forgotten home movie.

I dug out an old VCR from the pile of electronics in the living room, hooked it up to the ancient TV in the den, and popped the tape in. The screen flickered to life, and at first, it was just static. Then, a grainy image appeared.

It was a home video, alright. But it wasn’t of my family.

The footage showed a young woman sitting in a dimly lit room. She looked to be in her early twenties, with long, dark hair and a pale face. She was staring directly into the camera, her expression blank. Behind her, I could make out what looked like the same wallpaper that was in my grandmother’s house.

The video was silent at first, but then the woman began to speak. Her voice was soft, almost a whisper, but I could hear her clearly.

“If you’re watching this,” she said, “it means you’ve found the tape. I’m sorry. I didn’t want to do this, but I don’t have a choice. They’re making me.”

I felt a chill run down my spine. The way she said it—like she was pleading with me, even though she couldn’t possibly know who I was—was unnerving.

The camera panned slightly, and I saw something that made my blood run cold. Behind the woman, in the shadows, there was a figure. It was tall and thin, with long, spindly limbs that seemed to stretch unnaturally. Its face was obscured by darkness, but I could see its eyes—two glowing points of light that seemed to pierce through the screen.

The woman continued to speak, her voice trembling now. “They’ve been here for as long as I can remember. They watch us. They wait. And when they’re ready, they take us.”

The screen flickered again, and the image changed. Now it showed the same room, but the woman was gone. In her place was the figure. It was closer now, its face still hidden, but I could see its mouth—a wide, grotesque grin filled with jagged teeth. It was looking directly at the camera, and I swear, it was looking at \*me\*.

The video cut to static, and for a moment, I thought it was over. But then the image returned, and this time, it was different. The room was the same, but it was darker, and the figure was gone. Instead, there was a door. A door that hadn’t been there before.

The camera zoomed in on the door, and I realized with a sinking feeling that it was the door to my grandmother’s attic. The same door I had just come through.

The screen went black, and the tape ended.

I sat there, frozen, my heart pounding in my chest. I told myself it was just a stupid prank, some old horror movie my grandmother had recorded. But deep down, I knew that wasn’t true. The woman in the video had been real. And so was the figure.

I decided to leave the house for the night. I couldn’t stay there, not after what I’d seen. But as I was packing up my things, I heard a noise coming from the attic. A soft, rhythmic tapping, like someone—or something—was knocking on the door.

I told myself it was just the wind, or the house settling. But then I heard it again, louder this time. And then a voice, faint but unmistakable.

“Let me in."

I didn’t wait to hear anything else. I grabbed my keys and bolted out the door, not even bothering to lock it behind me. I drove to a motel and spent the night there, trying to convince myself that I was overreacting.

But the next morning, I got a call from the police. They said there had been a break-in at my grandmother’s house. When they arrived, they found the attic door wide open, and the VCR was on, playing the tape on a loop.

They asked me if I knew anything about it. I didn’t know what to say. How could I explain what I’d seen? How could I tell them that I thought something—something that shouldn’t exist—was in that house?

I haven’t been back since. I can’t. Every time I think about it, I hear that voice in my head, whispering, “Let me in.”

I don’t know what’s on that tape, or who—or what—made it. But I do know this: if you ever find a VHS tape in your grandmother’s attic, don’t watch it.

Just don’t

Author’s Note: I’m posting this because I need to know if anyone else has experienced something like this. I’ve tried to research the tape, but I can’t find any record of it. If you know anything, please, tell me. I’m starting to think I’m not alone in this.

And if you hear a voice, no matter how faint, don’t answer it.

Just don’t.
