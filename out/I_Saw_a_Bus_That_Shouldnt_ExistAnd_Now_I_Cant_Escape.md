I moved into my new house two months ago. It was a cozy place on a quiet street, perfect for someone like me who enjoyed solitude. Work had brought me to this small town, and the calm atmosphere was a welcome change from the bustling city life I left behind. Little did I know, this peaceful facade would soon shatter.

My first month here was uneventful. I settled into my new job, explored the local amenities, and even made a few acquaintances. It wasn't until the second month that things took a turn for the strange.

It started with a bus. I remember the exact date—March 14th. I had stayed up late, working on a project for work. The street outside my window was usually deserted after 10 PM, but that night, as the clock approached midnight, I heard the unmistakable rumble of an engine. I glanced out my window and saw it: a large, old-fashioned bus trundling down the street.

At first, I thought nothing of it. Buses sometimes ran late, and maybe there was a special route I wasn’t aware of. But the next night, it happened again at the same time. And the night after that. It became a nightly occurrence, always at midnight, always the same bus.

Curiosity gnawed at me. I checked the local transit schedules, but there was no bus route on my street, especially not at that hour. I asked my neighbors, but no one else seemed to notice or care about the bus. They brushed off my questions with polite disinterest.

As the weeks passed, my curiosity turned into an obsession. I started setting an alarm for 11:55 PM just to make sure I was awake to see it. I noted its details: an old, weathered vehicle with faded blue paint and a route number that didn’t exist—17A. The bus never stopped to pick up passengers, nor did it have any visible passengers inside. It was as if it was running on a loop, but for what purpose?

On April 4th, I decided to investigate. Armed with a flashlight and a sense of trepidation, I ventured outside at 11:50 PM. The street was eerily quiet. I waited, hidden in the shadows of my porch, until I heard the familiar rumble. Right on cue, the bus appeared, its headlights cutting through the darkness.

As it approached, I stepped out and waved my arms, signaling it to stop. To my surprise, it did. The door creaked open, and a cold, musty smell wafted out. I hesitated but then stepped aboard, my heart pounding.

The inside was as old and decrepit as the outside. The seats were worn, and the air was thick with dust. The driver, a gaunt figure with hollow eyes, turned to look at me. His expression was unreadable.

“Where does this bus go?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

The driver didn’t respond. Instead, he closed the door and the bus lurched forward. I grabbed onto a pole to steady myself as we picked up speed. The street outside blurred, and I realized with a start that we were no longer in my neighborhood. The familiar houses and streetlights had vanished, replaced by dark, twisting trees and an oppressive fog.

Panic set in. “Stop the bus!” I shouted, but the driver remained silent, his eyes fixed on the road. I rushed to the door and tried to pry it open, but it wouldn’t budge. The windows were fogged up, and I could see nothing of the outside world.

After what felt like an eternity, the bus finally slowed to a stop. The door creaked open again, and I stumbled out into the cold night air. I found myself standing in a deserted clearing surrounded by dense woods. The bus door closed behind me, and as I turned around, it vanished into the fog, leaving me alone.

I took a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart. I needed to find my way back home. The clearing was eerily silent, and the oppressive fog seemed to close in around me. I pulled out my phone, hoping to use its GPS, but there was no signal.

With no other options, I started walking. The trees loomed over me, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching out to grab me. Every rustle of leaves and snap of twigs made me jump. I tried to stay focused, moving in what I hoped was a straight line, but the disorientation from the fog and darkness made it difficult.

After what felt like hours, I saw a light in the distance. Relief washed over me as I hurried towards it. The light grew brighter, and I soon found myself standing at the edge of a small town. It wasn't my town, but it was something.

I walked through the empty streets, my footsteps echoing in the stillness. The buildings were old and dilapidated, as if the town had been abandoned for years. There were no signs of life, no cars, no people—just silence.

I continued walking, hoping to find someone who could help me. Finally, I came across a diner. The lights were on, and there was a faint hum of activity inside. I pushed open the door and stepped inside.

The diner was a stark contrast to the eerie emptiness outside. It was warm and bustling, filled with people chatting and laughing. The smell of coffee and frying bacon filled the air. For a moment, I felt a sense of normalcy.

I approached the counter, where a middle-aged waitress with a kind smile greeted me. “What can I get you, hon?” she asked.

“Can you tell me where I am?” I asked, trying to keep the desperation out of my voice.

The waitress looked at me strangely. “You’re in Hollow Creek,” she said. “Are you lost?”

“Yes, I need to get back to Maplewood,” I said. “Is there a bus or a taxi I can take?”

She frowned. “Maplewood? That’s quite a ways from here. We don’t get many visitors from that far out. Let me see if I can find someone who can help.”

She disappeared into the back, and I took a seat at the counter, my mind racing. How had I ended up in a place so far from home? And why was everything about this town so off?

The waitress returned a few minutes later with an older man in tow. He introduced himself as Joe, the town’s mechanic. “I can give you a ride to Maplewood,” he offered. “It’s a bit of a drive, but I can get you there.”

Grateful, I accepted his offer. Joe led me to his truck, and we set off. The drive was long and silent, the road winding through dense forests and empty fields. I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that hung over me.

Eventually, we arrived in Maplewood. Joe dropped me off at my house, and I thanked him profusely. He gave me a curt nod and drove off, leaving me standing in front of my home.

I breathed a sigh of relief as I stepped inside. The familiar surroundings were a comfort after the night’s ordeal. I collapsed onto my bed, exhausted but unable to sleep. My mind was too full of questions and fear.

The next morning, I tried to make sense of what had happened. I checked the news and local forums, but there was no mention of the mysterious bus or Hollow Creek. It was as if it had all been a dream.

But it wasn’t a dream. I still had mud on my shoes from the woods, and my phone’s GPS history showed the long route I had walked. I knew what I had experienced was real.

Days turned into weeks, and life slowly returned to normal. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me, waiting. Every night, I would peek out my window at midnight, half-expecting to see the bus again. But it never came.

I thought I had escaped whatever dark force had brought me to that deserted clearing, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t over. The bus was out there, somewhere, and it was only a matter of time before it came back for me.

And this time, I wasn’t sure I’d be able to escape again.
