Hades was always a strange mix of modern and the epitome of an 18th century lady. She always waited for me to open the door for her, but insisted on splitting the check. She complained constantly about how the old days were better but was also a lesbian. Not that I was complaining about the lesbian thing, not when I got her out of it. She may have dropped a couple more thous and thees in casual conversation than I was comfortable with, but she was also the funniest, most thoughtful person that I'd ever dated.

  
She made dinner for us at least once a week, and it was always something delicious but slightly strange. Hades would make little cookies that she told me came from the cookbook of an 18th century french chef that later ended up being beheaded. Or a stew that was, according to her, a staple of the medieval diet. Or a specific method of preparing fish that originated in the Edo period of Japan. I once mentioned a week into our relationship that black roses were my favorite flower because they looked badass as hell, and she got me them for our two year anniversary, without me ever saying anything else about them.

  
It was the flowers, ironically, that first made me suspect that there's something weird about her. I thanked her appropriately, gave her a long kiss to show my gratitude, put the flowers in an out-of-the-way, and promptly forgot about them for the next month. But when I finally remembered them, they weren't dead. In fact, they weren't even wilted. After a quick google, I learned that flowers can survive for around 12 days after being cut, at the absolute maximum. My first thought was that they were just a convincing fake, but after examining them closely, I ruled that out. They just looked and felt too real to be plastic.

  
"Hey, come here," I yelled across the apartment, poking the roses with the tip of one finger.

  
 From the shower, Hades yelled something indecipherable back. A minute later, she came out of our bedroom with her hair still dripping on the floor.

  
"You sound like a hyena when you yell, Clara," she said.

  
I rolled my eyes at her and pulled her over the flowers by the wrist. "Where the hell did you get these flowers? Look, they're still alive."

  
"Yeah, I guess so," she said, her tone totally opaque. "Do you want them to die?"

  
I laughed, dismissing them as just some unusually hardy flowers. "It'd certainly be less creepy if they did."

  
The next day, they had wilted over in the vase, and rot was creeping around their stems. When I brought it up to Hades, she refused to say a thing.

  
Hades would often go on 'business trips' that lasted for days at a time. I asked her over and over what exactly it was that she did for work, but she always found a way to dodge the question, or just changed the subject. When she came back from them, the first thing she would do was sleep for a full day. Then she would turn on the TV and watch the news, which was usually displaying some grim story about a freak storm that killed hundreds or a mass shooting or an unexpected explosion.

  
Eventually, I noticed that there was always a tragedy after her trips. Reliable as clockwork, if she went away, I knew that there was going to be death when she came back. Hades watched as bodies were recovered with the grimmest expression I've ever seen on a person.

  
I asked her, once, why she watched it, since she obviously hated it so much.

  
"It's my duty," she said.

  
The thing that made it all unravel came on a summer day, one of those where the sun felt like a physical weight. I could feel the sunburn forming on the back of my neck in real time. We'd just come back from the beach, after spending the day wading through the water and laying on the sand. The sun was just starting to set, and we were less than three feet from the door to our apartment complex. Hades had her arm hooked around mine and was singing the theme song for Big Bang Theory, making up new lyrics about the beach to get me to laugh.

  
"Sun, getting crispy, unraveling the mysteries, it all started with this beach thing," she sang.

  
The door to our place is sort of sectioned off from the rest with a brick wall, and the streetlight in front of it has been broken for as long as I can remember. There's an alleyway just beside the entry, and a man slipped out of it, setting himself solidly in front of us. His beard was tangled with dirt and crumbs, and he was wearing a scarf pulled up over his nose.

  
"Hey, darlings," he said, flicking open a knife. 

  
Hades pushed me behind her with one arm and told me to run.

  
"Hey!" he said. Suddenly he was right in front of me, grabbing me by one wrist and poking the knife into my chest. "You're not going anywhere."

  
Hades knocked his knife away, broke his arm, and put him on the ground in a movement so quick I couldn't even follow it.

  
"Don't touch her," Hades growled. Her eyes were glowing, faintly, in an unearthly red color that reminded me of flickering flames. She stood over that man, every inch the predator, and I knew that he was already as good as dead.

  
"Please, please," he begged. She didn't even acknowledge him.

  
The ground shook, and the wind picked up into a howl. Shadows gathered around Hades, or maybe they came from her, I don't know. There was a moment of total stillness, and then he was screaming and thrashing. Screaming like he was being tortured, like it would be a mercy to die. It lasted for an eternity, it lasted for seconds. But by the end of it, he was lying dead on the bricks. I’d never been scared of Hades before, but I was then. 

  
The rest of the night is... a blur. Hades called the police. She told them that he just collapsed, and when the paramedics arrived, they told us that all signs seemed to point to him having a heart attack. Hades tried to touch my shoulder, to apologize, but I shrugged her off and she seemed to understand. I checked myself into a hotel and she seemed to understand.

  
I spent the next week drunk in the hotel bed, trying to convince myself that I hadn't seen what I thought I had. Every time I slept, I remembered the way he had looked as he died. There was an article in the local newspaper the next day, about the unprecedented number of dead jellyfish that had turned up on the shore of the beach we had left.

  
At the end of the eighth day away, I called her with the shitty landline phone.

  
"Hey, Clara," Hades said.

  
I bit my lip, hard, and put the phone down in my lap for a moment. "Hey Hades."

  
We were both silent for several endless moments. I could hear the clock ticking past the seconds. I realized, eventually, that she was waiting for me to make the first move.

  
"You're going to come to the Starbucks on King Street in two hours, and we're going to talk about this," I said. Surprisingly, my voice didn't tremble.

  
She agreed, and I resisted the urge to flee the country as I hung up the phone.

  
Starbucks was, predictably, crowded as fuck. She was already waiting at a table in the corner when I came in, and I ordered some fancy coffee that I didn't want just to stall going over to her.

  
Soon enough, I couldn't put it off anymore, and I settled down across from her with my unreasonably large coffee. I slurped at it and tried to seem calm.

  
"So," I said. "You killed that man?"

  
"Yes." She didn't volunteer any more than that. I should've known; Hades has always been infuriatingly stubborn.

  
I sighed, and slurped my drink louder. "Why? How?"

  
"I'm Death," she told me, completely serious, "and he threatened you."

  
My straw fell out of my mouth and splattered hot coffee on her.

  
"Fuck off," I said. She was searching for something to clean up her shirt and cursing quietly the whole time; she didn't seem anything like Death.

  
She threw the stained towels into the trash can without looking. "It's true. I'm so sorry that I scared you. I was just so angry at Rob for trying to hurt you and I overreacted."

  
"Rob?"

  
She grimaced. "The man that I killed, that's his name."

  
Hades explained to me that she had limited omniscience around the people that she had marked for death. She was one of many reapers, all making sure that those who were supposed to die ended up dead, but she also had a bit of wiggle room in who had to go down below, so she could kill Rob without any consequences. Apparently she had done the celestial equivalent of becoming a part-time worker because she wanted to spend more time around living humans, which is how she was able to meet, date, and live with me. She had a speciality in mass death events, so she was often called in for those, and that was when she went on her trips.

  
"I need to think about this,” I said, hiding my hands in my lap so she couldn’t see them shaking. I was trying to get over my fear, to tell myself that she was the same person that I had known for years, but my instinctive reaction was still to get far, far away from the danger my lizard-brain sensed in Hades. 

She nodded, and told me to get in touch when I was ready.

  
It turned out that I was ready about an hour after I left the Starbucks. I knew Hades, I had loved her for years, and against my better judgment, I believed her about being a reaper. Furthermore, she only killed people that were already dying; if she or her coworkers did nothing, people would just live on in agony. A man with half of his body blown off or a woman that was suffocating because her lungs were collapsing would be forced to endure, with no hope of getting better and no hope of it ending. And she had only killed outside of that to protect me.

  
When I knocked on the door of the apartment, she greeted me with a bouquet of black roses.  
"Good morning, beautiful." She held out the flowers to me, hesitantly.

  
I took them. "I can't live in the same place as you right now, and I don't know if I trust you anymore."  
She nodded.

  
"But I still love you and I don't want to lose you," I said.

  
Hades grinned at me. "I love you too."

  
I leaned forward, holding the flowers between us. "You can take me on a date tomorrow, though. We'll see how it goes."

  
On the way home, I realized that the roses were made out of plastic. They would never die.
