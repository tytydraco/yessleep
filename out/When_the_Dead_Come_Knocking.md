This unending mystery began with a knock on every door one summer day. The knock that changed the world changed that day for me and everyone else on the planet.

The knock, the dead’s invitation, God’s mercy—it had many names. But I prefer “the knock” for its simplicity. It was night when it started: knocks and whispers of long-dead family members asking to be let inside.

Some scientists claimed it was mass hysteria, a collective hallucination. But it wasn’t, and it did happen. They didn’t take into account the disappearances. People all over the world vanished from their homes, and those on the streets met a more peculiar fate. It wasn’t discovered until later what happened to them.

But there were more pressing matters than the disappearances. It was what happened to the people who let in the things that presented themselves as family members. The people who reportedly let in whatever the hell was posing as their loved ones remained alive, but they lost their spark of humanity. They were left as husks of people in their homes. One officer who discovered a family said they looked like marionettes on strings, their movements no longer those of living, breathing humans.

Entire morgues were on the brink because they couldn’t handle the influx of dead bodies left in the wake of the knock. There were reports from morgue attendants that they would hear knocking on the refrigerated units holding the bodies. When they went to check, they would just see a body left in the same position.

The disappearances were the most perplexing part of all of this. Where did they go? That was the question on everyone’s mind. Entire countries sent battalions of soldiers to search the woods and comb the ocean floors with state-of-the-art technology, looking for a mass of bodies. The most disturbing part, though, was the homeless populations that disappeared. They weren’t really reported on until there were accounts of ungodly sounds coming from the tunnels under Las Vegas. The homeless were in those tunnels, and whatever the police found down there caused them to seal the tunnels off with controlled explosions.

My experience was, let’s say, unique. I was twenty-something, living with my parents and younger siblings. I was treated as a driver, always taking my family places and picking up food. I was out when it started, picking up food for the family at a fast-food place we liked. I was pulling into a parking spot to check if the order was right, not wanting to be yelled at for missing something. Then it happened. My car was suddenly engulfed in darkness.

I was confused at first, thinking it was a power outage. But then I took out my phone and turned on the flashlight. What I saw made my blood run cold. There were dozens of hands covering my windows, and in the center of them were eyes in various states of decay. I was horrified. I turned off the light, hoping what I saw was a figment of my imagination. When I turned it back on, the eyes were staring at me, and the fingers started writhing, scratching at the windows.

I turned off the light, and it stopped. I stayed huddled in the back of my car, curled up in the fetal position. My heart pounded in my chest, and I could hear the blood rushing in my ears. Time seemed to stretch endlessly as I lay there, too afraid to move or make a sound. Every creak of the car, every rustle of the wind outside, made me flinch.

The knocks and whispers that had plagued others had taken a more physical form for me. I could feel their presence pressing against the car, a malevolent force that wanted to get in. The hands and eyes were a grotesque manifestation of whatever was haunting us. I prayed they would go away, that this nightmare would end. But deep down, I knew it was only the beginning.

After what felt like hours, the darkness began to lift. The hands and eyes slowly disappeared, leaving only smudges on the glass as a grim reminder. I cautiously turned on the flashlight again, my hand trembling. The parking lot was empty, bathed in the cold light of the street lamps. I took a deep breath and forced myself to sit up.

I knew I had to get home, but the thought of driving through the dark streets filled me with dread. I started the car, every muscle in my body tense, and made my way back. When I finally reached home, the house was eerily quiet. I hesitated before entering, my mind racing with the possibilities of what I might find inside.

My family was there, but they were different. They moved slowly, their eyes vacant and lifeless. They didn’t acknowledge my presence, continuing with their tasks like automatons. The sight of them made my stomach churn. I wanted to shake them, to scream at them to snap out of it, but I knew it was useless.

The knock had taken them, just as it had taken so many others. They were alive, but they were no longer truly there. And I was left alone in a house full of shadows, haunted by the memory of those hands and eyes, and the knowledge that the dead could come knocking at any moment.
