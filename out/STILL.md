I wake up, and everything is... wrong.

No noise. No wind. No warmth. Just stillness—so absolute that it feels like the whole world has forgotten to breathe. I look around. There’s a house. Not mine. Not anyone’s. Just… a house. A road leading nowhere. A sky with no sun, no stars, no moon—just a blank, endless gray.

I take a step. The sound? Nothing. I jump. Land. No impact. Nothing.

I sprint. Full speed. As fast as my body allows. No exhaustion. No burning lungs. No ache in my legs. Just... motion without cost.

I don’t stop for hours. Then days. Then longer.

I should be collapsing. Should be dying of thirst. Should be losing my mind. But I’m not.

There is no hunger. No pain. No fatigue. Only me. Only this place.

I try everything. I walk to the horizon. It never gets closer. I carve symbols into the walls. They disappear when I blink. I scream at the sky. The silence eats my voice.

But there is something else. A light in the house that flickers—only when I’m not looking. A chair that resets to its original spot when I turn my back. A door that always faces me, no matter where I stand. Subtle things. Small things. Enough to remind me that I am being watched.

One week. That’s my limit. If I can’t escape in one week, I’m done trying.

Day one, I test pain. I punch the walls. Full force. My knuckles should be breaking, but they don’t. I grab a rock and slam it against my leg. Nothing. I climb to the roof of the house, take a deep breath, and jump. I hit the ground like a ragdoll—no impact, no pain, no bruises. Like the world itself refuses to acknowledge damage.

Day two, I try to starve. I don’t eat. I don’t drink. I sit inside and wait for hunger, thirst, fatigue—anything. But there’s nothing. My body doesn’t change. I don’t feel weak. Just... still.

Day three, I test the internet. Somehow, it’s there. Everything works. News, social media, messages—all of it, perfectly normal. But something feels... off. Am I actually talking to real people? Or is this just part of the trap?

I send messages. No one notices anything wrong. No one questions where I am. It’s like I never disappeared. That’s when I realize—this isn’t just a prison. It’s a perfectly constructed lie. A place where I have everything—except a way out.

Day five, I stop caring about escape and try destruction instead. I pick up a chair and smash it against the windows. The glass bends, warps—but never shatters. I try to set the house on fire. The flames flicker, but the wood doesn’t burn. This world isn’t real. It’s a loop. A cage with no doors, no cracks, no weaknesses.

The week is up. No doors. No answers. No escape. So I stop. I walk outside, find a spot, and sit. I do not move. I do not blink. I do not care. If they won’t let me go, then I’ll make sure they get nothing from me.

Time passes. Years? Decades? I don’t know. I don’t age. I don’t weaken. I don’t forget. I just sit. And as I sit, I wonder. Who built this place? Why? If they wanted me to live here, they made a mistake—because I won’t. I won’t talk. I won’t play along. I won’t be what they want me to be. I will wait.

After what felt like an eternity of stagnation, a subtle change began at the edges of my awareness. First, the silence fractured—a distant hum creeping into the void. I blinked, and the unyielding gray softened into the chaotic hues of dawn. The oppressive stillness gave way to a crescendo of sound and movement, and slowly, the world around me transformed into the real one I had once known.

People look at me, but I ignore them. No explaining. No dramatics. I just walk. There’s something I need to do first. I find a burger joint. Sit down. Order my meal.

The first bite is almost painful. Too much—too hot, too textured, too real after so long in nothingness. I chew slowly, letting my senses remember what food is. The salt, the grease, the warmth. I take another bite. Then another. Every flavor, every detail, hitting harder than anything I’ve ever tasted before. The meal is the first thing I’ve truly felt in longer than I can comprehend. I don’t rush. I let it sink in. The reality of it. The weight of being here again.

I finish my burger, wipe my mouth, and sigh. I stand up. I walk. But as I push the door open, a thought burrows into my skull like a parasite.

Was that burger... too perfect?
