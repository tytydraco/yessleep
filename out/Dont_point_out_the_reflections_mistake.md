I’ve never liked mirrors. They’ve always given me a weird feeling and I’ve always avoided them as much as I could. It’s always given me the uncanny valley feeling, like it’s not really *me* that I’m looking at.

I’ve recently moved out of my parent’s house and into a flat of my own. It’s just me and my cat. Living alone has been interesting. I get scared a lot by the little things. A creek in the hallway can no longer be explained away as a sound my sister made coming back from the bathroom or my father having a cup of tea before going back to bed.

I’ve gotten off track. What I meant to say is that I get scared sometimes partially, because I live alone and I wanted to get over it, because I am sick of losing sleep over something childish.

So I looked online and found that exposure can actually help in getting over a fear. Well I can’t expose myself to noises, but I thought that If I could start by easing one of my other fears then I would be less scared overall.

I made myself slow down my morning and evening routine. I spent more time in front of a mirror. Acted as if my face had become the most interesting thing to look at. And it worked a little. I didn’t lose my fear immediately, but I did stop rushing in the morning just to get out of the bathroom. It went so well that I started to smile at myself in the mirror.

I’ve always found smiling in the mirror the creepiest part. It just never felt real to me. Like there was someone or something on the other side mocking me, not really knowing what actual happiness feels like and just trying to copy it to the best of their ability. It feels fake. It doesn't look the same as it would on a photograph.

So that’s what became my new routine. Brushing my hair, brushing my teeth, washing my face and smiling at the mirror before leaving the bathroom and going about my day.

It took a week of me doing this before I spotted something. The smile on my mirror dropped a little after I had dropped mine. Just a fraction of a second later, but I could have sworn that I saw it. I freaked out internally, but I told myself that it was just my imagination. So I shook my head and tried again. Everything was normal this time not even a millisecond of delay, but the uneasy feeling did not go away.

I didn’t immediately leave the bathroom. It might sound stupid, but I didn’t want to tip the thing off that I had seen anything wrong, so I went about my routine as normal. And I did the same before going to bed. This smile was normal as well. I didn’t sleep well that night.

Nothing abnormal happened for two full days. Four times of me looking in the mirror and nothing out of the ordinary happened, but on the third day something did. It was too fast this time. It’s smile forming just a fraction of a second before mine did. It’s dimples appearing just a smidge before mine would.

I dropped my smile and it dropped its smile too. I kept looking at myself in the mirror. Hoping to spot another imperfection, but I didn’t find any, but I wasn’t done yet. I was sure of it by then. I felt vindicated in a way. That feeling that I’ve had since I was a child was correct. There is something wrong with my reflection.

I called a friend of mine that same afternoon. I’d already told him that I was going to try to get over my fear, but I hadn’t told him about my progress. He didn’t believe me. I told him to try and see for himself. Start smiling at his own reflection and actually look at it. He laughed at me, but he told me that he would humour me seeing as it’s not something that would take him just a few seconds every day. He laughed at me the first week. So much that I felt like an idiot. I started questioning what I saw and by week two I was fully convinced that he was right to laugh at me.

Your own mind can be the best gaslighter there is. I had myself convinced that I didn’t see anything. I started coming up with all kinds of excuses and convinced myself that I must not have gotten enough sleep beforehand and that I was just seeing things. Though I never managed to convince myself to smile at my reflection after it.

I stopped any and all fear exposure. I don’t smile in mirrors any more and spent the least amount of time as is humanly possible in my bathroom My sleep schedule is still horrible and I don’t get a wink of sleep sometimes when it’s windy outside and the house makes creepy noises, but things had over all been getting better.

That was until my friend, Tim, called me. He’s seen it too. It wasn’t his smile for him, but a movement. He moved his head to the left one time, but his reflection hesitated. It wasn’t long and you would never notice it you weren’t paying attention, but it was something.

Tim can be a little bit arrogant at times. So while most people would doubt themselves or question if they really saw what they did. Tim decided to question his reflection.

“What are you?” He asked. It did not answer. The reflection matched his every movement while asking it.

“What are you?” He asked it a second time. And again the reflection matched him syllable by syllable, but it didn’t answer.

He didn’t ask a third time, but he did try to get an answer out of it. He tried tapping the mirror, moving quickly to try and catch it in a mistake again, he tried closing one eye. Nothing  weird happened. The mirror matched his every move. He became frustrated.

So he did something that I cannot recommend anyone to do. He confronted it. “You’ve made a mistake, you hesitated. I know what I saw.” He told the reflection. The reflection didn’t do anything drastic. It still moved in all the same ways Tim himself did while he told the mirror this, but the eyes did change. Tim told me that they didn’t look like his eyes. There was too much hatred in them. That’s when he left his house. He came over to talk to me, tell me that I was right. He told me everything that happened. We were talking about what it could be and what to do about it when we heard it. The sound of glass shattering in my bathroom.

It's been about ten minutes since then. We’ve locked ourselves in my room. I could have sworn that I heard footsteps earlier, but I’m too afraid to ask Tim if he heard it too.

I’m too scared to open my door, but I don’t know what to do.

I thought reaching out to people who have experience with the supernatural might be a good idea. I was hoping someone might have experienced something similar and might be able to help. Any advice is welcome. We just want to survive.
