**Day 1 – Initial landing report – UTC: 9:32 AM – Transcribed audio log**

(There is a light static before the audio comes through.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Alright, one two, testing, one two. This is Lieutenant Hector, 2^(nd) in command of security on the S.S. Forager. All lights are green, audio’s receiving nicely, not peaking my mic. Perfect.

(Soft clap.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Hello people of Earth\~. Heheheh\~. We made it! We are on Sineen. The Hyper Drive Engine works and we got here in just 3 weeks. We’re here and…

(Hector takes a deep breathe.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** I really wish all of you could be here.

(There’s a sound of ruffling cloth, presumably Lieutenant Hector is shifting in place.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Uhhh… Sorry, professionalism (ahem). We’re going to be making daily, public reports. Mine will be presenting day to day exploration and construction of the colony base in layman terms. There’s doctors doing their own, more knowledgeable reports, for anyone interested.

We’ll be sharing these reports anywhere and everywhere. Humanity’s first journey to and settling of a new planet belongs to all\~.

Everyone, welcome to Sineen.

Not much to report for day 1 here but, I’m sure I’ll have plenty to say for day 2. Today I’m taking scout teams to search the surrounding area for any dangerous plants or animals.

See ya’!

(End of recording.)

 

 

 

 

 

**Day 2 – Flora and other surroundings – UTC: 6:30 AM – Transcribed audio log**

**Lieutenant Hector:** Morning everybody, reporting from the S.S. Forager’s cafeteria. Still eating and sleeping in the ship for now, until the scientists have finished their initial tests.

(Chewing can be heard over the microphone, it sounds like cereal. A young woman’s voice can be heard saying-)

**???:** Are you sure you should be chewing over the recording like that?

**Lieutenant Hector:** (Swallows) Oh, nuts. Uhhh… Everyone, this is Junior Astrobiologist Lin\~.

**Junior AB Lin:** Ahhh… Hello\~.

**Lieutenant Hector:** This one was really eager to join the expedition; I remember the campus we found you at. We advertised we were looking for fresh college grads to join us, had this HUGE crowd show up, and (chuckles) you were climbing on students’ shoulders and waving your arms to get our attention.

(Lin chuckles a little.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Alright, I seriously need to make these reports more professional. (Ahem) Serious time.

Yesterday’s scouting was good for us. No dangerous animals yet and we knew the air was breathable before we came here, but the environmental guys still need to run tests to see if there’s any pathogens in the air to worry about or if the plants are poisonous.

So, we’re still wearing our space suits outside the ship.

We should have reports by… When did they say we’d get it?

**Junior AB Lin:** Thursday or Friday.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Right, we’ll have a report in about 2 days, to see if it’s safe to walk around without suits.

On TODAY’S agenda, I’m taking my team back out again. We’re going to explore further and look for important land marks and/or natural resource deposits.

Work aside… It’s beautiful here… I feel like a kid sometimes; running into a garden, amazed by every plant I’d never seen before. The grass is BLUE in some areas, it’s incredible.

**Junior AB Lin:** Yeah, and the fin plants\~.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Mmmm\~. Would you mind telling the folks at home about them?

**Junior AB Lin:** It’s tall as a small tree, slightly rubbery in texture, and there’s only ONE main trunk going up; no branches. Then on the sides it splits off into these translucent, teal, fin-looking things that run the length of the plant. It’s incredible.

**Lieutenant Hector:** Mhm. And today we’re looking for more\~. See ya’ next time.

(There is a sound of something pressing and rubbing the recording device.)

**Junior AB Lin:** So, how far are you going out today?

**Lieutenant Hector:** 60 kilometers.

**Junior AB Lin:** I see… Be careful, ok? We still don’t know much about this place and it’d be bad if you got hurt far from the ship.

**Lieutenant Hector:** It’s alright, we’re taking a few buggies with us. If something happens, one of us will just turn around.

**Junior AB Lin:** Alright… Wait, the light’s still on.

**Lieutenant Hector:** What? Oh.

(End of recording.)

 

 

 

 

 

**Day 3 – Beauty and possibilities – UTC: 8:20 AM – Transcribed audio log**

(There is the sound of wind and a vehicle engine, both Hector and Lin are speaking in raised voices as they are riding in a moving Buggie.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** GOOD MORNING EARTH! Here with our Junior egghead again! What’s up Lin?!

…

**Lieutenant Hector:** She’s nervous, the buggie doesn’t have a roof!

**Junior AB Lin:** H-helloooo!

**Lieutenant Hector:** Ayyyy, there she is! SO, yesterday’s deeper exploration went pretty good! We found a river West of our Landing Zone and today we’re heading back down there with 6 buggies, security, and research teams!

We’re collecting samples of the water, looking for germs or whatever!

We’re also sending a couple buggies NORTH and SOUTH to do some more exploration!

LIN! Got anything to add?

... Pfft.

Y’know, if the buggie flips, it’s actually safer for you to hold the hand grip right here!

**Junior AB Lin:** Hey! You’re still recording! But, thank you for the tip!

(Hector and Lin laugh.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Sorry, sorry\~! Uhm, that’s it for now! I’ll report back in tomorrow with the results, barring something horrible happening to us!

**Junior AB Lin:** What?!

(End of Recording.)

 

 

 

 

 

**Day 4 – Helmets off! – UTC: 9:03 AM – Transcribed audio log**

(There is the sound of semi-trucks continuously passing by in the distance.)

**Lieutenant Hector:** Ladies and gentlemen, as of 7:18 AM UTC on Day 4 of our arrival, Sineen is confirmed to have perfectly healthy air to breathe.

First time feeling actual WIND on my face in about a month.

Yesterday we found some animals that can possibly serve as another source of meat. A bit smaller than cows, thick fur, with these angular heads; think of a humpback whale’s head except a little shorter… and furrier.

Water’s not gonna be a problem either, the scientists confirmed the river water’s good to drink.

Now for TODAY’S schedule, we found this wide incline that’s about 15 kilometers North and 12 kilometers West of our landing zone. It’s in the middle of a forest with pretty clear land on top. We’re going to establish a permanent colony base on that hill. The river’s 3 kilometers to the West of it too so, water’s pretty close.

We’ve got semi’s hauling resources and tools over there, to get started on the base and a water collection plant.

… Pretty overcast today, might be getting rain.

Alright, see ya’!

(End of recording.)

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Day 5 – MASSIVE DISCOVERY – UTC: 7:51 PM – Transcribed audio log**

**Lieutenant Hector:** Hey everyone, so, BIG news.

We did some more exploration today, 20 kilometers North of the Colony Base construction site, when we come up to this hill; about 40 meters tall. Well… Turns out the hill is actually hovering 3 meters off the ground. Trees, high dirt, and tall grass were mostly concealing the hovering.

We were no archeologists but, we just HAD to probe a little. So we grab our tools, the ladder, did some initial digging… and we discover stone slabs and bricks on the underside and stone wall on the side.

We look closer and see some parts of this “hill” are also a bit sunken and oddly straight, almost like you could line up a ruler on it.

So, we’ve got a floating, overgrown, intelligently designed structure, on a planet that humans made first-contact with 5 days ago.

We’ve just discovered aliens.

Some of the crew were a little spooked by the floating structure but, it’s been calmed down.

We’re heading back out tomorrow with archeology teams to give this thing a proper look. It could be totally normal, made of some kind of material we haven’t yet discovered, that… floats…?

Uhhh, something something repelling forces or what-not. I dunno, that’s for the physics guys to figure out.

What we DO know is, it’s clearly an intelligently designed structure. Popular theory among the eggheads is that there WAS intelligent life that’s now extinct.

The massive overgrowth lends credence to that theory, sadly… Y’know those documentaries and artistic depictions that show what cities would look like if we were gone for 100 years? This is like that, except even worse. Again, we thought this thing was a HILL at first.

And that’s it for today. I’ll bring you guys along tomorrow to the structure; see what the archeologists dig up.
