I brought Kylie's diary with me to college. The last lecture of the day was considered the most boring one by practically the entire class, so plenty of students spent the hour distracting themselves with their computers, playing videogames or checking social media. I opted to spend it reading a few entries of Kylie's dairy, desperate to find out more details about my cousin's fate, especially after the terrifying events I had experienced the previous night.

*December 28th 2005*

*Dear Diary,*

*I can't believe it! It's happening for real!  First of all, I've lost my second milk tooth this morning while I was eating cereal for breakfast, I've put it under my pillow so the Tooth Fairy can come to pick it up. But I'm also excited for another thing: My aunt and uncle have gone on a trip to another country together and have left Baby Jane with us in our house for a few days! Hooray! I convinced my Mommy and Daddy to let the baby sleep in my room with me. I'll ask the Tooth Fairy to bring me something I can give to Baby Jane.*

*Also, Jane the Doll cried again when Mommy and Daddy brought Baby Jane to my room in her crib. I think she wants me to put her right next to Baby Jane, so I'll do that tonight and the two Janes can sleep together! Isn't that cute?*

*December 29th 2005*

*Dear Diary,*

*I don't understand what happened last night. Baby Jane wouldn't stop crying. Jane the Doll was grabbing the baby's face and Baby Jane started moving her adorable tiny hands and feet because she wanted the doll away from her. I grabbed the doll and told her: "Bad, Jane, bad! Hurting babies is what naughty people do!". Mommy and Daddy came running to my room to see why Baby Jane was crying and they brought her to their room to sleep with them.*

*Maybe Jane the Doll doesn't like Baby Jane because they have the same name, I knew I should've named her Anabelle or something like that...*

My face went pale as I finished reading those two entries. For years, I had believed that Christmas Day of 2005 was the last time Kylie and I had ever spent time together, but apparently I was wrong. I had spent my whole childhood and adolescence asking my family about Kylie  and not even once did they mention that I had spent several days alongside her after Christmas Day right before her disappearance. It was a hard pill to swallow, but the diary confirmed that my family clearly knew more than they were letting out. But to what extent? Thinking about it send shivers down my spine, but I had to accept it was a factor I needed to take into consideration if I really wanted to get to the bottom of this.

"Hey, are you okay? You look concerned." asked Cindy, a classmate of mine who sat right next to me upon seeing my reaction to Kylie's diary.

"It's...nothing. I'm just reading a thriller novel with lots of suspense." I replied, discreetly putting the diary away so she wouldn't be able to see what I was truly reading. Cindy was really into creepy disappearances and paranormal experiences. One day, she told me a really weird story about a paranormal phenomenon occurring at a daycare, but I didn't really pay attention to her . I contemplated asking her for help in solving the case of my missing cousin and the doll, but I ultimately opted to keep investigating on my own, I didn't want to make this rabbit hole bigger than it already was by bringing in people who had nothing to do with it.

I arrived at my uncles' house after college and found myself alone for a while, since my aunt and uncle had gone to hang out with several other families they had met at their collective therapy sessions for  families who had lost their children, they were especially close with the parents of a little boy named Hugh as well as the parents of a teenage girl named Molly, both of whom had gone missing a few years earlier than Kylie in some incident I don't know much about.

My aunt and uncle had left lunch prepared for me, so I ate on my own and thought about what I would do later that night, since I didn't want to sleep with that Jane doll again. I figured reading more of Kylie's diary would give me a solution.

*December 30th 2005*

*Dear Diary,*

*Jane the Doll is behaving very badly since Baby Jane came to our house. I told my Mommy and Daddy about it, but they still don't believe that a doll is able to do all these things! Baby Jane sleeps in their room now, but Jane the doll is still causing trouble. Baby Jane and I were having a nap after lunch, but I was in my bedroom and she was in Mommy and Daddy's bedroom while they were in the living room. Jane the Doll was in my room at first, but then I fell asleep for a little while and she wasn't there when I woke up.*

*I ran to my Mommy and Daddy's room and Jane the Doll was in Baby Jane's crib and her hands were covering Baby Jane's mouth so she couldn't cry! I grabbed Jane the Doll and tossed her to the floor. Tonight I'll bring Baby Jane to my room and leave Jane the doll with my parents while they're asleep. They'll get mad at me but I don't care, I must protect Baby Jane.*

I was astonished, the experience with the Jane doll I had the previous night made it clear to me it was best to stay away from it, but I never could've imagined it had been after me since I was a literal baby! And Kylie caught on eventually and did her best to keep me safe! I had no doubt that accursed doll was responsible for whatever had happened to her.

It was then when I noticed there was only one last entry of the diary left to read, I eagerly turned the page in order to find out what secrets could Kylie's last testimony hold:

*January 2th 2006*

*Dear Diary,*

*The baby...the baby...where is the baby?*

*Did Jane take the baby? Did Jane take Kylie?*

*The baby is not with me...the baby...protect the baby...Kylie must protect the baby!*

*Kylie is here, Jane is here, but where is the baby?*

*Kylie will always protect the baby, ALWAYS!*

If the previous entries had impressed me, this last one simply left me speechless to a point I cannot describe with words. The things Kylie had written up to that point had described outlandish situations, sure, but the events they narrated at least maintained a certain degree of cohesion and structure. In contrast, this last entry didn't really narrate any events at all, and instead seemed like the ramblings of someone who had gone mad and was in the middle of having a mental breakdown! It was hard to believe a little girl who had once been so innocent and cheerful could have written something like this. But its disturbing content wasn't the only thing that felt off about this last entry, the date, it was supposedly written in January 2th of 2006, but the previous entry was dated December 30th of 2005...What happened between those two dates? It was apparent a couple of pages had been removed, but by who?

Just when I was starting to theorize about the mysterious last diary entry and the pair of missing entries, my aunt and uncle arrived home. For that night, I decided to follow Kylie's plan and get the Jane doll away from my room by putting her in the attic, I also locked my bedroom's door for good measure.

I was woken up in the middle of the night once again, only this time, it wasn't because of something coming from inside the bedroom, but from the outside. I could've sworn I had heard the attic's door opening at the other side of the hallway.

*tap,tap,tap,tap...*

Footsteps, someone was coming to my bedroom. It didn't take long before they knocked on the door.

"Who...who's there?" I uttered, but received no response.

They kept knocking, again and again...growing more and more impatient until what had started as normal knocking turned into aggressive banging.

I lay on my bed horrified as the entity at the other side of the door began to whisper some familiar words:

"The...baby..." a little girl's voice repeatedly uttered. I had no doubt it was the same shadowy child from the previous night.

*tap,tap,tap,tap...*

All of a sudden, the sound of footsteps echoed across the hallway once again, someone else was heading to the bedroom. I felt shivers going down my spine as the sound of rattling keys was followed by the slow and eerie creaking of my bedroom's door...whoever they were, it was evident that second individual had come to open the door for the Shadowy Child...for Kylie!

I frantically hid under the bed as the door opened and the outline of the two individuals became barely visible in the dark hallway, right in front of the bedroom.

Kylie stepped inside the bedroom as the other individual, who was much taller, began to walk away with a very familiar limp...

"You won't...take her away..." Kylie murmured as she aimlessly roamed around the bedroom. I had tried to talk to her last time, and that had only resulted in her attacking me, so I opted to keep silent under the bed.

After several minutes of roaming the bedroom filled with confusion and anger, Kylie crouched and crawled under the bed. My heart was racing as I thought she had found my hiding spot and was coming for me, but to my surprise, she curled into a ball and began weeping, seemingly unaware of my presence just a few inches away.

I held my breath as well as the tears that  were flowing from my eyes, trying not to make a sound as I slowly wiggled away from Kylie, who was still quietly sobbing in a corner. Slowly but surely, I began emerging from under the bed, the upper half of my body had made it out, but I was still struggling with my legs and feet.

*bump...*

My face went pale as I felt my right foot hitting one of the bed's legs. Kylie yelled as she reached out with her arms to try and drag me back under the bed. She tried to get a hold of my feet, but by that point I had stopped trying to be stealthy , I stood up and quickly sprinted out of the bedroom as I could see Kylie's blurry silhouette crawling from under the bed.

"Jane! What's wrong? Why aren't you in your room?" My aunt and uncle exclaimed in confusion as I ran to their bedroom.

"You know what's going on!" I replied in a combination of anger and fear.

"What are you talking about? Shouldn't you be asleep? You have to get up early to go to college tomorrow!" They said, continuing to act clueless.

"I'm talking about Kylie! I can hardly believe it myself, but Kylie's still in there and that creepy doll of hers has something to do with it!"

"Oh, Jane...we get that Kylie's disappearance has affected you ever since you were a child, we're the first ones who wish we could see her again. We also sometimes imagine that she's still with us, but we have to face the truth and press on, we can't let our lives be consumed by grief. You're tired, you should really go back to sleep. We can talk about this tomorrow if you need to, okay?" my aunt uttered in a soft motherly voice as she hugged me.

Seeing how trying to talk to them was futile, I ended up doing what they told me and going back to sleep...but not to Kylie's bedroom. I spent the remainder of that night sleeping on the couch downstairs.
