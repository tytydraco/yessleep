I always knew something was wrong with my sister, Amy.

Twins are supposed to be close. We shared everything growing up—clothes, a room, secrets. But somewhere along the way, Amy started keeping things from me. She had a love that she wouldn't share. A love that wasn't real.

It started small. We watched Inuyasha together, both of us crushing on him like any normal teenage girl might. But Amy... Amy took it further. She talked about him like he was real, like he existed somewhere beyond the screen. At first, it was innocent—sketching his face in her notebooks, whispering in her sleep about him. But then, she started saying things that made my skin crawl.

"He’s waiting for me," she’d say, eyes shining. "He just doesn’t know it yet."

I’d laugh it off, thinking she was being dramatic. But then she stopped watching the show with me. Instead, she’d lock herself in her room for hours, headphones on, listening to Inuyasha’s voice over and over. I caught her once, rocking back and forth on her bed, eyes glassy, whispering his name under her breath.

I should have done something.

Her obsession grew. She started dressing like Kagome, then Kikyo. She’d stand in the mirror for hours, practicing ways to say his name just right. Then came the notes—pages and pages of love letters, written as if Inuyasha could somehow read them. She left them on the windowsill at night, convinced the wind would carry them to him.

And then she started talking about the barrier.

"My soul is trapped here," she told me one night, her fingers digging into my arm hard enough to bruise. "My real body is waiting for me in the Feudal Era. This world isn’t right. It’s keeping me from him."

It got worse when Mom and Dad tried to intervene. They took away her Inuyasha posters, deleted her episodes, even threw out her Kagome uniform. That night, I woke up to her standing over my bed, just staring at me.

"You understand, don’t you?" she whispered. "We’re twins. You should feel it too."

Feel what? The sickness in her mind? The way reality bent and cracked around her?

Then came the night of the blood.

I woke up to a sound—dull thuds, wet and sticky, like meat being tenderized. When I stumbled downstairs, the house was silent. Too silent. And then I saw her.

Amy stood in the living room, drenched in red. The walls were streaked with it. The floor sticky. In her hands, she clutched something heavy—a kitchen knife, dripping. Her eyes shone in the dim light, wide and distant.

"I did it," she breathed. "I broke the barrier."

Behind her—God, I still see it when I close my eyes—Mom. Dad. Torn apart. Throats open, bodies slumped like broken dolls. The air was thick with the metallic stink of blood.

Amy turned to me, smiling.

"He’s coming for me now," she whispered. "I just had to free myself."

I ran. I don’t even remember how I got to the neighbors, only that I screamed until my voice cracked. The police came. They found Amy sitting in the middle of the carnage, humming the Inuyasha theme song, tracing his name in blood on the floor.

They took her away. Locked her up in a place where she couldn’t hurt anyone else. But sometimes, I still hear from her. Letters come in the mail, scrawled in her shaky handwriting.

"The barrier is still here."
"I see him in my dreams."
"He’s coming for me."
"And when he does… you’ll see."

I burn the letters. I try to forget. But I can’t shake the feeling that somewhere, in the deepest corners of her mind, she’s still waiting.

Still believing.

And I wonder… what happens if she’s right?
