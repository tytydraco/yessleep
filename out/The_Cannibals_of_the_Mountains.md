Renato and I were hanging by a thread. The fast-paced life in São Paulo had drained us: our patience, our humor—even our silence. Everything was noise, lines, traffic, pressure. So when we saw that ad on the vacation rental website, it felt like a sign. *“Rustic house high up in the mountains, perfect for those seeking peace and isolation.”* Exactly what we needed.

The drive there was long and bumpy. By the time we left the asphalt and hit the dirt road, the sun was already beginning to set. We passed through thick forest, a few abandoned fields, and then... nothing. No houses, no human sounds. Just the wind and the song of birds I had never heard before.

The house was older than the pictures had shown, but it had a certain charm—sloped red-tile roof, wooden porch, a collapsed fence on one side. I opened the door and the smell hit right away: damp wood mixed with something else... hard to describe. A musty scent, like cloth stored in a basement. Renato made a joke, calling it “the smell of peace and quiet.”

Inside, the house was simple. A living room with an old couch, thick rug, a small kitchen with white cabinets. The bedrooms were upstairs, but one thing caught my eye immediately: an old, solid wood cabinet that didn’t match the others, which were modern and metallic. The wall behind it stood out too. It didn’t match the rest of the kitchen. It was wooden, while the others were made of brick and mortar. I ran my hand over it out of curiosity.  
— “Weird wall,” I said to Renato.  
— “You and your horror movies,” he laughed.  
I let it go. It was just a wall.

That first night was quiet, which alone made the whole drive worth it. Used to horns, sirens, and street yelling, the forest silence was almost deafening. We went to bed early.

I woke the next morning with *that feeling*. You know the one—like someone’s watching you, even when no one’s there. I went to the kitchen to make coffee and stepped onto the porch in my pajamas, trying to shake off the weight in my chest with the smell of trees and earth.

That’s when I noticed the footprints.  
In the soft dirt by the side of the house—human footprints. They led up to the living room window... and stopped. They didn’t return. Didn’t go further. Just stopped, as if whoever made them had vanished into thin air.  
I called Renato. He tried to laugh it off.  
— “Probably the caretaker.”  
— “There is no caretaker.”  
— “Maybe from an old guest.”  
But the prints were fresh. The earth was still dark and damp. Hard to ignore.

That night, we locked everything up. I checked the doors and windows twice. A third time, just to be sure.

At two in the morning, I woke up to a low sound coming from the kitchen. A slow creaking. Like a door being opened very carefully.

I called Renato. He got up to check. Came back saying everything was fine—but I knew better. A small voice inside me told me to stay alert.

 

The next day, after breakfast, Renato and I decided to explore the area around the house. The mist still clung to the woods, but gradually, the sun tore through the white veil and revealed the landscape: hills covered in low brush, a few twisted trees, and a silence broken only by birdsong.

It was beautiful, I won’t lie. A silence that seeped into your skin. We walked slowly, hand in hand, saying little. It felt like the whole place was waiting for us to be quiet—to listen better.

After about forty minutes of walking, we saw the “neighbor’s house” the ad had mentioned—the only one for miles, according to the owner. An old structure with mud walls and a crooked roof. There was a low fence and a wooden gate hanging by one hinge.

That’s when I saw him.

A boy. Skinny, maybe 17 at most. Worn-out shirt, pants too big, dark hair falling across his face. He stood at the edge of the woods, about twenty yards from the house. Not moving. Just watching us.  
— “You see him?” I asked.  
— “Yeah. Is he... staring at us?” Renato squeezed my hand.

The boy didn’t say anything. Didn’t move. Just stared with an intensity that sent chills through me. It wasn’t curiosity. It felt like he was studying us.

I felt exposed. Like we were naked in that landscape. The discomfort rose so fast we didn’t even need to speak—we turned and walked back the same way. Not running, but not looking back either.

When the house appeared between the trees, my heart jumped. The door. It was slightly open.  
— “Did you lock it?” I asked, already knowing the answer.  
— “Yes.”

We approached slowly. The kitchen light was on. I swear I’d turned everything off before we left. Renato went in first. I stayed by the door, holding my breath.

Nothing seemed out of place. The living room looked the same, backpacks in the same corner. But something... I can’t explain.

Renato searched every room, opened cabinets, looked behind doors. Nothing. No sign of a break-in.

But the feeling didn’t go away. The same one I’d had the night before. Like something in that house was watching us.

And worse: now it knew we knew.

 

That night, I woke up with a start. The mattress was moving slowly. When I opened my eyes, I saw Renato getting up, stepping carefully on the wooden floor.

— “Renato... what is it?” I murmured, still half-asleep.

He paused for a second, then whispered:  
— “I think I heard something downstairs.”

My stomach dropped. I sat up, straining to hear what he had. Nothing. Just silence. But the way he said it killed any urge I had to argue.

We grabbed our jackets and went down slowly, one step at a time. When we turned the hallway corner, the kitchen light was on again.

Standing at the edge of the room, it took us a few seconds to notice. Renato pointed at the floor, eyes wide. The floor was full of marks. Footprints. He knelt down and ran his hand across the dirty tiles.  
— “Is this... mud?” I whispered.  
The muddy prints led straight to the wooden cabinet—the oldest one in the kitchen.  
The trail stopped there. “This doesn’t make sense,” he muttered. I said nothing, just scanned the room, feeling that deep, cold fear you only feel when something’s *really* wrong.

Renato slowly opened the cabinet, expecting... who knows what. But there was nothing—just plates, old pans, some cans of corn.  
Carefully, he began tapping the sides of the cabinet with his knuckles. Solid wood... until he hit the back. The sound changed. Hollow.

He looked at me. “There’s something here.” That’s when we saw it—a barely noticeable groove in the wall beside it. He pulled hard and the wooden panel creaked, revealing a short door with a rusty old latch. Renato reached for it. “Don’t open it yet,” I said instinctively. “Let’s think. Let’s call someone…”

Renato froze, hand still on the latch, as if struggling inside. I didn’t want to seem hysterical, but everything in me screamed *do not go further*. That’s when we heard it—a sound like a woman screaming.

 

Renato yanked the latch. It cracked like a dry bone snapping. The door opened a few inches with a groan, and a strong smell rushed out. Something between stagnant water and rotting flesh. I recoiled instinctively, covering my face. My stomach turned.

Renato turned on his phone’s flashlight and pointed it inside. It was a tunnel. Narrow, damp, the walls supported by wooden beams, lined with uneven stones and moss. The floor was dirt and mud, with fresh footprints mixed into the muck. It didn’t look like a basement—more like a coal mine.

“This isn’t normal, Renato.” My voice was trembling. He nodded, but looked hypnotized. He crouched and went in, and I followed. The light swung across the walls like it was revealing secrets that didn’t want to be seen.

The tunnel branched off underground. We followed the one that spiraled downward for a few yards, ending at a wooden door reinforced with beams and chains. On the floor were marks, as if something heavy had been dragged to that spot. The air smelled stronger there—almost unbearable.

Renato ran his hand along the doorknob. Locked. But there was a small gap between the door and the frame. He brought the flashlight closer, and I leaned beside him to peek inside.

And that’s when we saw, for the first time, proof that something horrifying had happened there.

There were remains. Bones. Some small, others far too big to belong to animals. Torn fabric stained with dried blood. A chain hanging from a hook in the wall. A rusty bucket in the corner. We had no idea how long we stood there, paralyzed. But when we finally turned to go back through the tunnel—guided only by the weak phone flashlight—we were horrified to discover the passage we came through... was now closed.

 

Something heavy was blocking the path. Renato pushed hard, but it was useless.  
"What do we do now?" I whispered, barely able to speak.  
Before he could answer, we heard voices coming from the dark tunnels behind us. Twisted laughter and the sound of footsteps in the mud. Renato turned off the flashlight, and we stood still in total darkness, listening to our own hearts pounding too loud.  
When they noticed our presence, they began to shout and run toward us.  
Without thinking, we bolted through the tunnel, stumbling and hitting the dirt walls. We ran blind, guided only by the instinct to survive, trying to escape the maddened voices that seemed to close in from every side.

That’s when we found another door. Old wood, the lock nearly rotted through. We knocked, pushed, but it seemed locked. Behind us, the voices drew closer.  
The door creaked and suddenly opened. A small room, stinking of mold and rot. And inside, almost invisible in the dim light, was the boy we’d seen outside — thin, filthy, eyes wide open. Without a word, he made a quick gesture for silence.  
We rushed inside, and he quietly closed the door, sliding a piece of wood across it to act as a lock. From the other side, we heard our pursuers arrive and start banging, trying to break it down.  
The boy pointed to another exit — a trapdoor hidden under a pile of torn clothes.  
With hurried gestures, he guided us. We crawled through a tight passage that led into the kitchen of the house. There, we saw a woman — his mother, I assumed — with her back to us, cooking something on a wood stove. She was humming a children’s song off-key, unaware of our presence.

With quiet steps, we crossed the room. The boy opened the back door. The cold night air hit us like a slap. And we escaped into the yard, running without looking back.  
He stayed at the threshold, motionless, watching as we disappeared into the darkness.

We ran through the yard, not looking back. The tall grass cut our legs, branches scratched our arms, but the only thing that mattered was getting out. Renato chose not to turn on his phone flashlight again so we wouldn't give away our position. The moonlight barely lit the path, but even in the dark we could see our car parked at the front of the house, just as we’d left it.  
Renato pulled the keys from his pocket and tried to unlock the car, but it didn’t work.  
"Damn it…" he muttered, pressing the button over and over.  
That’s when we noticed all four tires were slashed and the hood was slightly open — the battery was gone. They wanted to keep us trapped.

The voices and footsteps were getting closer. We could clearly hear more than one — several — coming toward us. They shouted nonsense, some laughing like kids playing tag.  
"Run! Run!" Renato yelled.  
We left the car and dove into the dense underbrush, heading the opposite way from the voices. The cold night air burned our lungs with each frantic breath. Thorns tore our clothes, but the adrenaline kept us from feeling any pain.  
After what felt like an eternity of blind running, we saw something ahead: metal structures reflecting the faint light. As we got closer, we saw what it was — an empty lot filled with old, abandoned cars swallowed by weeds.  
We didn’t think twice. We began opening doors, trying to find a vehicle that could still save us.

Most were just junk: rust, rotted seats, broken steering wheels.  
Then Renato whispered, "Here! This one!"  
It was an old car, but intact. And miraculously, the key was still in the ignition.  
Without hesitation, he turned the key. The engine coughed once, twice… then caught, sputtering but alive.  
As Renato revved the engine to keep it going, I saw through the broken windows of the junkyard — shadows approaching. Three of them, running, waving their arms like rabid animals.  
"Go! Go! Go!" I shouted.  
Renato floored it. The car jerked forward, bumping into old shells of metal and wood. As we reached the dirt road, we could already see some of the pursuers coming out of the brush, their faces twisted with rage.

We left that hell behind. The house, the tunnel, the pursuers — all disappearing in the rearview mirror, swallowed by the darkness. But the car didn’t make it much farther. The engine died, leaving us stranded in the middle of the woods and night. Still, it was far enough to get away from that nightmare.

After hours of walking through the forest, exhausted, filthy, and still terrified, we finally reached the main road. We flagged down the first car we saw, and the driver, seeing our condition, didn’t hesitate to take us to the nearest police station.  
Sitting under the cold lights of the lobby, we recounted everything we had been through: the isolated house, the tunnels, the pursuers, the mute boy who helped us. As we spoke, the officers exchanged glances — some serious, others with a mix of disbelief and unease.  
Despite everything, they agreed to go with us to the place, now in broad daylight, to verify our story.

We arrived at the house, now bathed in sunlight. From a distance, it looked like just another old farmhouse. But as the officers inspected the area, they began to find signs: trails, debris, fresh marks in the dirt.  
Inside, the scene showed signs of a rushed abandonment — still-warm pots, clothes strewn about, inner doors flung open. In the tunnels, the officers found disturbing evidence: personal belongings from several people, IDs, broken phones, torn clothes.  
One of the officers muttered while examining the items:  
"We’ve suspected that family for years... The Hobolds."  
They explained that the family, of German descent, had long been investigated for the disappearances of tourists in the region, but there had never been enough proof. Now, with our testimony and the evidence found, they could finally act.

As I got into the police car, I looked back one last time. For a moment, I thought I saw the silhouette of the mute boy at the window, watching us. I felt a bitter mix of relief and sorrow. He had saved us... but was still trapped in that nightmare.
