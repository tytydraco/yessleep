QUICK WARNING! I AM NOT THE BEST AT WRITING, SO EXPECT IT TO BE SHIT, EVEN THOUGH IT HAPPENED DOES NOT MEAN IT CHANGES MY ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO WRITE IT BETTER THAN MY CURRENT ABILITY!  
Hi there, first and foremost my name’s Snagglepuss, now obviously that’s not my real name, but, I’m going under the “Snagglepuss” alias for obvious privacy reasons, I’m also a big fan of anything old, if it came before I was born, I am fascinated by it, anyways, i’m here to talk about something that happened to me a good few years ago, and by a few I mean it happened about 8 years ago now, almost a decade, god why haven’t I said anything up until now, oh that’s right! It’s because I thought no one would believe me! Only time I’ve ever told anyone about this is when I went to a therapist a few days after it happened, tell me it was a dream or it was some hallucination or something and charge me my liver, half my hear, and both my lungs! Even here! Feel like people won‘t believe me and think it’s just a *spooky campfire story or creepypasta*.

And to be honest, I don’t blame you, I don’t blame anyone for not believing me, trust me, if I saw some stranger’s post on a random subreddit claiming they “broke into some old defunct studio that has literally **ZERO** online or pretty sure any information about it and there being a band of creepy crawlies“ i’d think it’s just some stupid cheesy creepypasta too, and trust me… I would too if I didn’t experience it.

I was about 22 when it happened, me and my 4 friends, who for privacy reasons, I will not be using their real names and instead be calling them by the alter-egos, Shaggy, Papa Smurf, Drooper and Casey Kelp.

Yes I am going to be referring to everyone (with the exception of the characters owned by the studio we explored) in the story, including myself by the names of Hannah Barbara characters from shows my dad had a couple vhs tapes of or i found out about via the garage sales the residents of my grandparents retirement home would have every couple weeks.

No i will not be changing what I am calling to them by to anything else because imagining a blue old white-bearded guy with a large ass nose wearing only a pair of red pants and a gnome hat, a skinny dude who may or may not be a stoner in a green shirt, a lion in nothing but a helmet, sunglasses and spats with a really long tail, a pink panther with a bow tie, cuff links and shirt collar despite not having a shirt or cuffs to put said cufflinks on, and some weird teenage pink thing with a snorkel on its head all breaking into an abandoned studio and all freaking out when something scary happens, it’s funny, rereading it in my head while imagining the voices of the characters in the lines is even funnier, and to be quite honest with you guys, while typing this I needed some chuckles.

Anyways, decided to do some urban exploring, film it, upload it to the internet, monetise it, and watch the money roll in, which, at first seemed like a solid idea, however, Kelp suggested we check out the abandoned tv studio 3 hours away from where we live, at the time it seemed like a great idea, of course if any of us had psychic powers, we wouldn’t of agreed so quickly, but since no one did have any psychic powers, we did and so a couple days later, we hopped into Shaggy’s van, and drove over.

When we reached the metal gates, the place was.. surprisingly in less ruin than we thought, and trust me, we all expected the place to be in quite a bit of ruin, sure nature had reclaimed the outer walls, there was some moss on the bricks, the gates were rusty and had some vines on them, and a window or 2 was smashed, all the signs for the studio either missing, or too faded or mossy to make out, but the place was in pretty fine shape all things considered, due to how old the lock was.

Drooper got a crowbar and whacked at the thing a few times and lock broke off, as the lock broke off the gates creaked open, we then got out our camcorder, flashlights, and everything else that we needed, locked the van up, opened the gates fully so we could go in, and went in. There were a good few sets and rooms to check out, Papa Smurf suggested we split up but Shaggy had seen one too many horror movies at the time to want to do anything like that, then Drooper chimed in saying there was only one camcorder and if we all wanted somewhat equal time in the video, we’d all need to stay together.

Of course Papa Smurf pulled his phone out and said and I quote “Have you ever realised there’s this magical little thing we like carry around in our pockets called a phone? Have you? Have you?”

In other words he had just told us we had our phones and we could just record on them and questioned why Drooper had even bothered to bring a camcorder in the first place, that’s when Drooper admitted he didn’t bother to bring his phone, stating that he thought the camcorder was all we needed to film, Papa sighed in exasperation at Drooper’s incompetence, he then asked why Drooper even thought that in the first place, Drooper then said that he asked Shaggy if we needed to bring our phones, to which shaggy told him no, Papa then asked Shaggy why he told Drooper that we didn’t need to bring our phones, Shaggy then told Papa that he asked Casey about it and she said that we didn’t need to, Casey quickly said that she asked me if we needed to bring our phones to which I said no, Papa looked at me and I told him that I asked him about it, to which he said no, Papa asked when I asked him about it to which I said I called him a couple days before.

As it turned out I had chosen a bad time to call Papa, as I had just woken him up when I called him.

After that we decided to just not worry about it since it was a little bit of everyone’s fault only Papa had brought his phone, as we didn’t exactly NEED to split up to explore the place, after some rather uneventful exploring in the other rooms and a couple sets, we entered the break room, this was where I found a vhs tape with a colourful but faded logo on it, with it reading simply “THE BOOGIE BUGGIE BUNCH ADVENTURE HOUR” I picked it up and inspected thoroughly, Casey noticed me looking at it and asked me why I was looking at it to which I responded I was just curious as to what it was, ”you do realise there‘s a vcr player here, right?” She said, pointing to an old box tv on top of a vcr, without a word I walked over to it and put it in, I’d press play before a theme song would play, the others would all notice it and go over to see what the hell that “annoying“ (according to papa Smurf at least) song was coming from, with footage (both animated and live-action), seemingly of the show would play, the characters were a bee, an ant, a spider, a rhino beetle, a mantis, and a ladybug.

According to the song, the characters names were Hunny, the bee, Charles, the ant, bingo, the spider, Bruce, the rhino beetle, Arnie, the mantis, and Maggie, the ladybug, who apparently wasn’t actually apart of the band and just lived with them, the inner-Hanna-barbera nerd in me quickly said how similar it looked to the banana splits and friends adventure hour, to which shaggy would immediately make fun of me for.

We’d decide to check out a bit of it and it’d seem as though the show had an animated half and a live-action half, but we could’ve figured that out by the clips in the theme song, After a good 10 minutes of watching the show would have a cliffhanger, a literal one at that, for a bumper then a commercial break, which made us all cackle like hyenas due to the editing.   


The animated bumper featuring Bingo and Hunny, but for Hunny’s involvement it was just barely, it was abiut bingo sending a film reel of his musical play pitch to a big theatre company, after a couple seconds a snail mailman gave bingo a letter from the company, upon opening it, the reel would be thrown at his head and an arm belonging to a stereotypical business man with a cartoon gun in hand would shoot him in the face, his sunglasses breaking in the process revealing the 2 tiny black beady eyes underneath, Hunny would walk over asking him what had just happened, bingo telling her the company had rejected his idea for the musical play, with hunny making the horrible pun, “Well you know what they say, I guess that’s showBUZZ for you!” Before bingo hitting her across the head with the reel for the terrible pun.

Suddenly, it freaked out, flashing and glitching, thankfully none us were epileptic, after a couple seconds of it glitching out, it’d cut to black.  
  
We‘d ejected it, hoping nothing had happened to it since an obscure, most likely lost show like this would be worth a good amount of money to be sold, heck uploading it would probably peak A LOT of people’s interests, and talk about monetary gains\*, thankfully the tape was still intact, drooper would put the tape in his backpack and we’d begin to leave since there was nothing else other than footage of the place and a tape of a probably lost show about a band of talking bugs and a ladybug that lives with them.

But when we were leaving, we’d start to hear the theme song again, this time sounding off, the vocals, sounding like a creature trying to sound human, but getting it ever so slightly wrong, the instrumental was much like the vocals, ever so slightly out of tune and offbeat, it was faint, yet noticeable.. and it sounded like it was coming from somewhere a couple rooms away from ours, we’d walk over to the source and the place it was coming from was a room with the faded label on it, “sound stage-05” with the quiet on set light being on 

“I thought this place went defunct?” Casey asked 

“Certainly seemed like it” drooper chimed in

”Well then let’s check it out” Papa suggested

“Why do we have to check it out? The characters in horror movies always check out the source of the strange noises, and we all know what happens after… CHOMP!” Shaggy said, clearly freaking out 

“Don’t be so dramatic, the place might still have power and the song probably started playing due to faulty wiring” Papa Smurf said, clearly trying to calm shaggy down when things weren‘t right but there was an obvious hint of doubt in his voice, he seemed to know that it probably wasn’t true, but he still wanted shaggy to keep calm in case it was nothing.

Slowly we’d open the door and enter the room, the room’s set looked as though it had been kept the way we’d seen it in the tape, like someone was still using the set even after the show had ended and the studio went defunct, but it wasn’t the set that really was the thing that caught our attention, it was what was ***on*** the set that gave us goosebumps.

It was a group of large humanoid bugs, each one resembling a character from the boogie buggie bunch adventure hour, all of their movements unnatural, like an unskilled puppeteer‘s shoddy attempt to make a marionette move, one was a large bee-like humanoid, with a sharp stinger, a ripped and dirtied dark yellow skirt and matching boots, it’s fur, striped a sickly-greenish yellow and charcoal black, it’s fur looked like an old rug, it was holding a microphone stand and singing the tune, it’s torn wings flapping in sync with the rhythm, it was seemingly supposed to be Hunny.

Another was a lanky humanoid ant-like creature, with a tattered brown open vest, it’s beady eyes were a pure soulless void black, the thing was playing a weird bass guitar shaped like a bass you’d see in an orchestra with 2 broken strings, each time it moved it’d make a cracking sound like it had not moved for decades, it looked as though it was supposed to be Charlie.

the next one was a humanoid spider thing, it‘s fur was a bright orange, overgrown, under trimmed, matted and mangy, on it’s face, there was no fur, instead it had this weird wrinkly human-esque skin on it, it’s mandibles being the same case, it had a large, human-teethed toothy grin on it’s face, it had a hunched stance, it was sitting at a set of drums and all of it’s hands had drumsticks in them, it wore a pair of broken sunglasses, revealing it’s grey fish-like eyes the other sets of eyes were black and beady, cufflinks adorned it’s arms despite the lack of a shirt, it was most likely supposed to be Bingo.

Another resembled a rhino beetle, playing a guitar, everything about it, from it’s stance to it’s body shape was was gorilla-like, it wore a pair of broken sunglasses much like the spider’s, it’s mouth opened, revealing it was full of a mix of long shape needle-like teeth and large human teeth, it was most likely supposed to be Bruce.

Finally, the last one visible on the stage, there was a mantis, playing a keyboard with it’s long, sharp mandibles, it wore a tattered, long-sleeve shirt and a comedically large ripped and dirtied yellow bow tie, it was lanky yet it wasn’t the most skinny, it also had a more feminine look then the rest of them, it‘s face looked as though it was dumbfounded, like something had just happened and surprised it so much it’s brain had been fried because of how surprised it had just gotten, honestly it was far less terrifying than the rest because of that, looking more goofy than menacing, that one was most likely Arnie.

a lidded hole in the wall popped open, out came a small, humanoid, blue-ish ladybug creature, it looked really angry, like, unnecessarily angry, it was seemingly Maggie, it was also the first of them to notice us, it let out a shriek, immediately alerting the other ones as the theme song halted, the creatures all slowly turned to us, after a facing us fully, the bee creature spoke, its voice nasally, and ever so off “Hey everyone! Look! A new audience! Let’s be sure to give them a show they won’t EVER forget!” We booked it as soon as one of them stepped forward, we kept running and didn‘t look back once, we didn’t know if the things had given chase and we didn’t want to.

We ran to shaggy’s van and floored it back home, after driving back to our town drooper realised something, he dropped the camcorder while he was running, needless to say we were all equally pissed, we had gone there to explore and film the place and had nothing but a vhs tape featuring a bunch of bugs to show for it, sure it was probably worth a lot and every lost media fan would freak out if we uploaded it online, but the main reason we went there was gone, we all went home after that.

The next day, shaggy had called all of us in a panic, telling us to get over quick, we all got there as fast as we could, we all lived a short 10 minute walk from each of our homes, when we got there, shaggy‘s van had been vandalised, with the words “Jeez, talk about a tough crowd!” written on it in a green, honey-like substance, needless to say shaggy was freaking out, we were all also rather freaked out, but Casey suggested it could’ve just been some pranksters, despite how impossible it seemed, for anyone else to know of our experience

and papa Smurf went to check to see if it was still locked as it was one of those old vans that could easily be unlocked by a lock pick, the door easily opened, shaggy seeming like he was on the verge of passing out, thinking something had been stolen, but thankfully, if you could say that, the only thing we found that was even remotely off was a poster of the show with all the characters having signed it, and in the middle, “You barely know us! Give us a chance! We don’t normally bite too much!“ we all were a little freaked out by it, but poor shaggy was taking everything that had just happened and what had happened with the van the worst, he was basically having a panic attack, poor dude always frightens the easiest when anything that can‘t be rationally explained happens.

And the rest of what happened is what I said at the beginning, but before I go I’d like to add, sometimes, when I’m lying awake at night, when it’s quiet, I hear the faint sound of the boogie buggie bunch theme song playing, when my eyes are closed and I’m slowly drifting to sleep, I hear a quiet murmur in my ear, I’d only just able to barely make out the phrase “C’mon give us a chance new pal! Haha!”

I will forever hope every time I hear that, it was just my mind playing tricks on me.

And I will forever beg to every god I know, I will wake up, with nothing there, instead of facing those THINGS ever again.

why do you think I haven’t said the name of the studio or where it is? I don’t want anyone seeking the studio or those ungodly beings out, I don’t want anyone to find out what becoming a new audience means, and I don’t want anything to happen to anyone because of me.

But if you were unlucky enough to encounter anything related to those things, please tell me, let me know your story, because the question that’s been haunting me for all these years, has anyone else ever heard of the boogie buggie bunch?

\*we haven’t gotten to uploading it yet even after all these years but none of us know how to convert a vhs tape to digital
