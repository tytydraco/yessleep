**I Have A Unique Ability With People**

For clarification, my name is James. I’m 20 years old and attend college as a junior (I won’t tell you the name for the sake of privacy, but it’s a pretty low-level college as far as colleges go). I’m studying for a master’s degree in biomechanics. I’m writing this as a journal to log the strange events happening to me recently and to get feedback and suggestions from you fellow Redditors. Please bear with me and excuse any grammar mistakes I may make, as I’ve never done this before.

I realized I have an ability at around 9 years old. I can scan a room full of people and memorize their clothes and faces in 40 seconds. That, paired with an exceptional memory, makes for a (good and terrible combo). I have learned to keep this ability a secret, as it made my younger years very awkward and troubling for me.

For example, in my freshman year of high school, I accidentally made a girl think I was a stalker when I was just trying to compliment her. It went a little like this:

***“Hey Tara! I saw that pink sweater you were wearing a few days ago! It looked really good on you!”***

***“What? I’ve never spoken to you?? Get away from me, freak!!”***

I probably should’ve set up an “accidental” meeting with her and met her before I called her by her name and complimented her on a sweater she wore the week before. As you can tell, I’m pretty bad with the ladies—and society in general. I’m a bit of a loner. Nine times out of ten, I freak people out with the amount of info I know about them before I even meet them (it’s amazing the kind of drama and secrets you can pick up on from people just by listening to them in passing). Thus, I never really made any friends, except for two.

**“Alex,”** who I met when I moved into my two-person dorm my freshman year of college. We instantly became best friends, often going out and partying into the wee hours of the night. And **“Roscoe,”** who I subsequently met when I barfed down her shirt at one of the said parties Alex and I attended.

Okay, now that you’re all caught up on my friends and my ability, I’ll tell you why I’m making this journal.

I’ve been seeing a man everywhere I go. He just stands there staring at me, always wearing the same clothes: a T-shirt with a dark trench coat, black pants, boots, and a hat. He always stands around 10–15 feet away from me and changes locations every time I look away. He has varying expressions on his face. Sometimes he’s sad with a large frown, sometimes he’s angry with his face twisted up, sometimes he’s happy with a sinister grin.

It all started when Alex, Roscoe, and I went to a park after a late night of drinking. It was around 12:30-ish. We plopped down on the swingset and gently swayed with the wind. Alex was engrossed in his phone, texting his girlfriend Emma (Emma isn’t her real name, but the one I’m giving her for privacy). Roscoe and I were engaged in a conversation about “Wardommer 50k: Green Marines 2,” which had recently been released.

We had just finished our conversation when a large “CRACK” sounded all around us. It sounded sort of like a glass bottle shattering, amplified by 100x. All three of us jumped out of shock. Alex was the first to speak up.

***“What the hell was that?”***

We all looked around, trying to find the source of the sound. Nothing had seemingly changed. I started to speak when it first happened.

***“I don’t know, man, but it was loud as hell. My ears are ring—”***

That’s when the wind picked up and blew my swing backwards. I slammed into an object behind me. I quickly turned my head and looked behind me. A man was standing three feet from my face; his face was twisted into a wide smile stretching ear to ear.

I screamed at the top of my lungs and leapt out of my swing, hitting the ground HARD. I landed on my elbows and backpedaled around 10 feet until I slammed into the large slide behind me. Alex and Roscoe jumped out of their swings and ran over to me. Roscoe quickly blurted out,

***“James!! Are you okay?? What happened!!”***

I didn’t reply, only staring at the man, still standing perfectly still behind the swings with that same wicked smile on his face. It seemed… inhuman. He hadn’t moved, breathed, or even blinked since I leapt off my swing. I yelled at the man,

**“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING, CREEP!”**

He didn’t respond…

Alex and Roscoe seemed concerned. They both looked back at the swings, then back at me, then looked at each other. I could tell they thought I was crazy.

***“Do you not see him? He’s right there!”***

Roscoe looked back at the swings, then looked at me.

***“What are you talking about, James?? There’s no one there. Seems someone forgot to take their meds again,” and laughed.***

The facial expression I made must have told her I wasn’t joking. Her face went from joking to seriousness in half a second. Alex and Roscoe tried to pick me up, but I brushed their hands away, making sure I didn’t look away from the man standing perfectly still behind the swings. Some kind of guttural instinct told me to run. Every fiber of my body told me to get up and sprint until my legs gave out, just to gain any kind of distance away from that man. So I did.

I’ve never moved faster. I didn’t even think of Alex and Roscoe. I just ran. I ran for so long my lungs felt like they were on fire and my legs hurt. After a while, I forgot why I was even running. I could feel my body starting to crash from the adrenaline. But I kept running because it felt like the right thing to do. I had lost track of time, only focusing on not falling over from exhaustion. My brain reminded me, in the form of short, quick flashes, of who I left behind—Alex and Roscoe. That’s when I stopped running and caught my breath.

I turned around, and to my surprise, standing under a dimly lit streetlight about 15 feet away from me stood him… the man. Except this time, he had a different expression. His face was gnarled. It looked as if a bear had attacked him, chunks of flesh and skin falling off of his head. All the while, his face was twisted in an expression of pure rage and anger. His eyeballs were missing, and yet I could still feel him staring into my soul. I was frozen in fear. I felt as if, if I looked away, he would get me and drag me into the pits of hell.

I don’t know how long I stood there in the dark, staring into the two black holes where his eyeballs used to be. It felt like days. Weeks even. My other senses had been dulled. I noticed that my vision was blurred; all except for him was visible. My hearing had been reduced. I couldn’t feel my body. I tried flexing my fingers, but they wouldn’t. I eventually gave up, just waiting for my fate to take me. That’s when he spoke.

In the deepest, most guttural voice one can imagine, he said,

***“It doesn’t matter how far you run, James. I’ll be there. Always around you. When you’re running, sitting, standing, eating, breathing… sleeping. I’ll be there.”***

That’s when I felt the impact. It felt like a thousand suns slamming into my body all at once. I flew through the air and hit the cold, hard pavement. My vision became engulfed in darkness.

That sums up the events of the past 24 hours. I awoke in the hospital, Alex and Roscoe by my side. They told me I had been hit by a sheriff on his way to Alex and Roscoe when they called the cops because I ran into the darkness. They searched for me for hours on foot because I had the car keys in my pocket. They said the sheriff hit me around 15 miles from the park.

The hospital sent me home with two broken ribs and a broken arm (America’s healthcare system…). I’m currently lying here in my bed, writing this on my laptop. I’m sore and everything hurts, and that damn man won’t stop staring at me from my closet.

I’ll keep you all updated if anything else happens.
