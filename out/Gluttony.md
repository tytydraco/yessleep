After I was done with my degree, it was difficult to find work. Turns out, the market for data scientists is over-saturated with ambitious nerds who suffered major burnout, me being one of them. However, I was one of the lucky ones, as I was able to find a job, albeit three hours from Oslo in a small little village in the middle of nowhere. Who could’ve guessed that for the same amount of rent that I was paying for my small, shoebox sized apartment, I could’ve spent on renting a nice family home in the countryside. It even came with its own pantry and compost bin! Take that city living!

Leo adjusted to the environment quickly. I always felt a bit bad for forcing him to stay inside, of course, I didn’t have a choice in the big city. However, here he could go in and out whenever he pleased, even though he spent most of the time sleeping, that lazy feline bastard. When Leo got back from one of his trips out in the woods, he brought something with him. A small, malnourished mouse. I quickly ordered him to drop it, and of course, he didn’t at first, but eventually he got bored and placed the mouse on the floor. It had a tear in its ear, most likely a courtesy of Leo. I presumed that the little guy was dead, but after Leo victoriously walked away to groom his long orange fur, it twitched back alive. I was always a bit of an animal lover growing up, to the point where I would cry when my friends stepped on ants, so I took major pity on the critter. I was eating an oatmeal cookie at the time, so I decided to split it in half, and give it to the mouse. He graciously accepted and started nibbling at the speed of light. It was late November, and a layer of fresh snow had just fallen with more to come, so I didn’t have the heart to kick it out immediately. I decided to let it stay until it finished the cookie, but I must have dozed off or something as when I came to, the mouse, its part of the cookie, and my cookie were all gone. I didn’t think much of it, how much trouble could one mouse cause around the house?

I didn’t think much of the interaction until the next day before I left for work when I saw the mouse again. It was a bit larger and didn’t look like it was starving anymore. It was, however, still on the hunt for more food, namely Leo’s leftovers. The animal lover in me struck again, as I didn’t see any harm in the little guy eating food that would have otherwise been wasted. I even got a tiny bowl, smaller than the one I had for Leo, and put some extra cat food out for the mouse. It had started to snow even heavier, so I didn’t have the heart to let it fend for itself against the elements. I thought to myself that I am doing a good deed, and that hopefully, in another lifetime, the mouse would do the same for me. It would not.

As the days went by, I fell into a routine. I wake up, fill the bowls, head to work, and come back home. It didn’t even occur to me that the bowl was always completely empty, and not only that, so was Leo’s bowl. I guess I rationalised it as Leo having gained a larger appetite as winter came around, he did tend to do that in the past. At this point, I had not seen the mouse for a week or so, to the point where I basically forgot about it, the only reminder being the constantly emptying bowl.

I met with the mouse again in early December. I got home after a long and tiring day at work and nothing was out of the ordinary. I went to refill the bowls, eat dinner, and decided that I would call it an early night. As I go to bed, Leo lays on my legs, his favourite sleeping spot, and I drift into sleep. I usually don’t dream, and when I do it’s incredibly tame and boring, like stapling documents at the office, but this night was different. I was alone in the forest, walking. I felt hungry, not as in “I could grab a snack” hungry, but true hunger, the kind of hunger that would force a man to eat his kin. In the dream, I stumble on a man laying on the forest floor. He was covered in blood and severely frostbitten, his clothes raggedy. I kneel down by the man, he did not even glance at me as he started chanting under his breath. “All mouths are waiting for you.” As I lean towards the man’s thigh, he chants louder. I bite into his succulent flesh, and then shoot up from my bed. The sound of Leo hissing combined with intense sharp pain I feel in my left thigh jolts me out of my sleep. And there it was, the mouse, but it wasn’t really a mouse anymore, more of a rat. And a large one at that. It had grown to a size comparable to Leo, however, I could still recognize it as the same individual by the bite mark on its ear. It bit into my thigh.

The moment I jumped up from bed, I sent the rat flying across the room. “That fucking bastard!” I thought to myself “I gave him all that food and this is how he repays me?” The rat scurried away faster than I could chase him, and I was still tired from the long day and now from a random rat nibbling on my thigh, so I decided to lock my doors and against my better judgement, go back to bed.

The day after, out of spite I guess, I decided not to fill the rat’s bowl. I was in a hurry that day as well, as I had overslept, probably because I was exhausted from the night before. I was planning on going into the local exterminator’s shop after work to get this little pest dealt with, however, mother nature had other plans. A blizzard alert was issued for my area, so everyone went into apocalypse mode. All the businesses in the small town centre had closed early, and everyone was rushing to the grocery stores. The blizzard was not supposed to last that long, only two or three days. Luckily, I got to skip the grocery store madness as I had just filled the pantry to the brim the day before, so I had enough food to be stuck in my house for a whole week! I had a cheeky grin on my face as I saw all the people at the supermarket, rushing to fill up their cars with groceries in the cold winter storm brewing while I was riding the last bus out of town.

When I got home, my grin faded.

When I got into my house, I heard a faint snoring sound. I followed the sound to the source. It was coming from the pantry. The door was ajar. I must have left it open when I was rushing out of the house. I opened the door wider, and my world shattered. Rows of empty shelves and opened cabinets, and in the middle of the room was the culprit, fast asleep. The “rat” had grown ever larger, around the size of a fridge, and large tumour-like growths decorated its body. Mucus-like saliva was dripping from its mouth onto its enormous gut, and it was snoring loudly.

I froze. The majority of my food supply had been devoured and there was a giant rat that had already tried to eat me once in my house. I closed the door and pushed the dinner table in front of it after I snapped out of the shock. Luckily, the rat did not get into my fridge, nor Leo’s food drawer, so we had food to last us at most three days. I thought about walking back to town, however the storm had already started, and I did not fancy walking for an hour to the store and back. I was stuck with the rat.

I went to bed anxiously, but there was nothing else I could do. The idea to kill the rat crossed my mind, but I was afraid what would happen if I failed. My thinking was that I could tough it out until the blizzard passes, after that, I take Leo and my most important stuff and leave this godforsaken house.

That night, the previous dream continued. I stood up from the man, his blood dripping from my mouth as he shouted his mantra in agony. Before me stood the rat, its tail reaching for me. His warm appendage wrapped around my neck, and I could feel the hunger worsen. It was as if my stomach was imploding. I dropped to the ground, writhing in agony. I looked up at the rat and though it did not verbalise anything, it put words into my head. Or rather just one.

“Feed”

I woke up, the word reverberating in my skull. I knew I couldn't feed it as well as myself and Leo. I looked outside and the storm had grown worse overnight. It was at this moment I noticed the loud banging noise that was coming from inside the house. I ran to the door of the pantry, and my suspicion was correct, the rat was violently crashing into the door, trying to get out. 

The door to the pantry was an old, rickety wooden door. It would definitely not be able to handle the weight of a gigantic rat for three days. I had to find a way to keep that rat fed without me starving to death. I needed to find food that I couldn’t eat but he could. Well, food that me and Leo couldn’t eat. And then it hit me, I could feed him the compost. The only problem was that it was in the outdoor shed.

After putting on my warmest winter clothes and boots, I stepped up to the front door with a plan. The blizzard had grown to the point where you couldn’t see two steps in front of you, but the compost bin was around twenty metres from the front door and in the opposite direction. My plan was to tie a rope around the handle of the door and around my waist, then I would hug the wall of the house until I saw the shed, then I would get the bin and bring it back.

The door opened, and a cold gust of wind hit my face. I had experienced cold winters before, but there is a difference when you know that the weather could decide your fate. I could feel the cold creep up my face and behind my ski mask. I pressed my body against the wall of the house. I could feel my temperature drop with every second spent out here. At that moment, I realised that I would rather be in the house with a blood thirsty beast than be outside in this weather. I needed to get that compost bin fast.

I managed to get to the other side of the house, and I could see the outdoor shed. I would’ve rushed to it if my rope had not been too short. Just three more metres would’ve been enough. I had to loosen the knot around my waist and let the rope drop. If I did not find it again, I would be done for.

I made it inside the shack. The compost bin is quite heavy, and its wheels would most likely not be very efficient in knee deep snow. I found some more rope in the shed, so I tied it around the compost bin to make makeshift backpack straps. I then noticed the axe I had used for firewood. I was hoping it works on rats too.

I put the compost bin on my back, and to no one’s surprise, the storm had worsened. I could barely see the end of my nose. That was the first time I prayed since middle school. I could not get lost now. I couldn't give up.

I marched forward, every step feeling like a herculean task, especially with my left leg, as with every step I took, the pain from the bite mark grew worse. I could see the end of the rope. I made it back.

When I got inside, I was greeted by unholy squealing, like if a pig smoked a pack a day for twenty years. It wasn’t surprising that the rat was making these sounds. I wheeled the compost bin to the pantry door entrance, where I saw that its disgusting snout had made it out of the door opening. Its saliva was flying everywhere, it was biting the air like a rabid dog. I wheeled the bin closer, and the squealing turned into a low growl. It retracted its face from the door opening. With all my courage, I pushed the table aside, and with my heart pounding in my throat, I opened the door.

The rat was sitting like a king patiently awaiting its luxurious meal, eyeing me up and down. I pushed the bin into the room, and it started ravenously tearing through the decomposing plants and food scraps. I closed the door immediately; I didn’t want to get caught in the crossfire. I then stacked all the furniture I could move in front of the door. I could still hear its voracious chewing sounds.

I sat down to have dinner. I didn’t eat anything. The sound was too much to handle. I imagined myself in the place of the compost bin. 

That night, when I went to bed, I stared at the ceiling for ages. Listening. The frigid winds outside. The crackling of the fireplace. The gnawing of the rat. There was nothing I could do anymore except pray that it will stay full for two more days.

In my dreamscape, I found myself in the woods again, but there was no man, or rat in sight. I was alone, sitting on the cold snow. It was numbing. The cold was creeping up my spine. I felt my blood freezing.

The morning seemed peaceful. Too peaceful knowing the situation. The storm was still raging outside, but I could not hear the rat anymore. When I went to check up on it, I could not hear anything. No snoring, no munching. Silence.

At first I was relieved, however, paranoia soon took over. What if it escaped? I could not keep still. I felt it could jump out at me at any moment.

I decided to set up a “base” in the kitchen. This way, I could keep an eye on the pantry, and if the rat attacked from any side, I had an escape route. I decided to lock Leo in my room with his litter box and food. One less variable to keep track of.

I sat there. For hours. Waiting. Waiting for something to happen. But nothing did. The sun started to set and I was getting suspicious. I decided to check if the rat was still there. I moved all the furniture anxiously, and checked through the keyhole. All I saw was darkness. I double and triple checked if the light was on and yet still pitch black. I put all the furniture back in front of the door. I couldn’t risk it lurking in the shadows.

The radio had been playing the entire day. I guess I needed a little distraction so I wouldn’t go mad. I was curious about when the buses would go back to normal. It seemed the storm was dying down. However, after I put the furniture back, I got the worst news I could’ve possibly received. The storm wasn’t dying down, in fact, it was just getting ready for round two. The meteorologists were expecting the blizzard to last for another day or two before it would die down for good.

My legs gave out. I could not keep it in anymore as tears started to roll down my face. I could not go another day with that thing in my house. It felt as if my heart was about to explode. I knew what was coming.

A weird sense of peace came over me, like that of someone who knows they are going to die. I went to bed with my gut turning and an empty smile on my face. I must have stared at the ceiling for hours with Leo purring on my legs before sleep finally took over.

I found myself in the woods again, where the dream had left off. There was frost covering my body now, and I fell over. I couldn’t move. I saw the man from the first dream walk over to me as I was laying on the cold snow. He kneeled down next to me. He leaned close to my face, and pressed his lips against my forehead. I could feel him licking down the bridge of my nose, and then he moved back. He looked me in the eyes and said: “Give thanks to it. It is good; for its mercy endures forever.”

My eyes opened wide. I was alone in the room, still dark outside. The door was wide open. Leo was missing from my legs. Then the sound of gnawing hit my ears. As I made my way to the pantry, I heard the sounds of the rat chewing. The sounds of bones cracking, of flesh tearing. I could only look in terror, with a blank expression as the door to the pantry was wide open. A mass of hairy flesh was flowing out of the broken door frame. The growths had turned into legs and tails and more growths. Then I saw its maw. It was dripping crimson red. With orange fur tufts sticking out of its teeth. I grabbed the axe. I slashed and chopped at the cranium of the beast with tears running down my cheeks. It didn’t bleed. The beast then raised one of its tails, and smacked me across the chest. I heard my bones breaking. Even more so when my flying body hit the flimsy wooden wall. I was knocked out cold.

When I came to, it was morning. A warm, pulsating mass was grabbing onto my ankle. It was one of the beast’s tails. I managed to kick off the tail and run to my room. And this is where I am now. I have nowhere to run, and little to no food left. I could run into the storm, but the blizzard is at its most powerful. I would die within the hour. I could continue to feed the beast, first the cat food, hoping that it’ll be fed long enough for me to get out of this hell. However, I don’t think I can live with that option. I am going to burn this place to the fucking ground, with it, and me still inside. It is the most honourable thing to do. I do not know if this thing can even die, but frankly, I don’t give a shit. There is no scenario where I survive. I wanted to post this as a cautionary tale: Don’t give the mouse a cookie.
