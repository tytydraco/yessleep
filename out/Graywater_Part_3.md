I’ve got a little bit more written down. Not as much, I get dizzy after so much of it. 

Here’s where to start if you’re seeing this for the first time:

For the first five minutes of the drive, we didn’t speak a word to each other. Silently trying to make sense of what happened at the hospital. I drove on auto-pilot, turning onto streets I shouldn’t have known. Muscle memory from a childhood I didn’t remember.

Ryan kept looking the photo over, turning it over, then back again. Expecting it to be different somehow, or maybe to finally remember when and who it was taken by.

“We grew up here, right,” he finally said. It’s not a question, but it sounds like one. “Right? We grew up in this town.”

“Yeah.” I answered, my voice rough.

“Why don’t I remember this house?” This time I didn’t answer, because I couldn’t. 

The town felt older as we drove along, almost like time had forgotten it just like we did. Not just in fashion but…older, wrong. We passed stores with names we almost recognized, a diner that we could have been to once, or maybe it was our favorite. Street names that I could recall, but only after reading them twice over. It was all so foggy.

“Jay.” Ryan’s voice was tight. “What’s Luke’s last name?”

“Morri-….” I stopped and frowned. “Wait, is it…Or…” The silence stretched. I’ve known Luke since I was a kid, I should know this. Ryan pulled out his phone and clicked the number pad a few times. He opened up his contacts and scrolled down to Luke’s name. *Luke*. 

“Fuck.”

I slowed the car as we pulled through a neighborhood. We were almost outside the city limits, on backroads no one could have navigated unless they’d done it a hundred times before. The street sign just ahead of us read *Scottsdale Road*. Fear and anxiety welled up in my chest, tugging me in opposite directions. Every instinct built into my frame was telling me to turn around. To go home. To forget this place again. But I pressed down on the gas anyways, my friend needed me.

The houses on Scottsdale were old, probably built in the fifties or sixties if I had to guess. Their paint peeling and yards overgrown and dead. Picket fences once adorned in white now cracked and rotted, slats missing and gates broken down. Windows broken and siding half hanging touched the ground. Complete and utter abandonment. Everything about them screamed at us to get away, to go back to our lives before we suffered the same fate.

Except for one. I stopped the car, and looked on in disbelief. The house that sat in the middle of the street was still old, still dilapidated. But the yard was cut down, and the fence was locked with a chain. It claimed two stories, and there was once fresh white paint. As I scanned, I could make out faint flowers growing in the garden. *It’s October* I thought. I looked over at the photo in Ryan’s hand. This was it. 1315 Scottsdale. There was no mistaking it. I cut the engine off.

“We don’t have to go in.” Ryan said even though he was  unbuckling his seat belt. 

“You’re right, we don’t.” The words left my mouth as I opened the door. Deep gray clouds began to swell in the sky as we exited the car. “But Luke’s in there.” 

“Luke might be dead, Jay. You saw the drawer—“

“Empty.” I cut him off sharply. “The drawer was empty.” We slowly began to cross the street together. The asphalt felt off under my feet. Soft- threatening to give way at any moment and drop us into an abyss. I kept expecting a car to come billowing down the street, for someone to call out from one of the many houses. But this place was dead. No birds. No distant sounds of traffic. Just silence.

I examined the lock on the fence. Old. Very old. Rusted shut after years of rain and snow. After a moment or two, I placed my hands on top of the fence and threw my legs over. Ryan followed just behind and, and then stepped to my right. We sat and stared at the house for what felt like hours. I looked over at the garden bed. Lillies. In full bloom.

“How is that possible?” Ryan asked. I didn’t answer. Approaching the front porch, I noticed three steps. I knew there were three, there had always been three. Every time I climbed them. Hundreds of times. Racing my friends to the door, our sneakers thundering on the wood.

“Do you remember this place?”

“No.” But my feet knew where to step to avoid a loose board. Second step, left side. And with each step closer to the door, the key grew hotter, almost vibrating even.

The porch was empty except for a single rocking chair, still moving slightly, like someone just stood up. There was a child’s drawing on the seat. Ryan picked it up, and held it out so I could see it too. Three little stick figures. *JAY LUKE RYAN*. 

“I drew this,” Ryan whispered. His hands were shaking softly. “I remember this.” He folded it up, and slid it into the back pocket of his jeans.

I tried to peer through the windows, but behind the dust I could only see through a tiny crack in the curtains. Too dirty to make anything out. The front door was made of dark wood, heavy and sturdy. There was a brass knocker shaped like a hand. No, not a hand - too many fingers. I pulled out the key. It was vibrating now, humming in my palm like something alive. The lock was old-fashioned, ornate. The key should fit. Will fit. Has fit before.

I placed my ear up against the door. Inside, I heard nothing. No voices, no metal grinding, no breathing. And somehow that felt worse. My hand shook as I brought the key up to the keyholes. I sat there briefly, the key inches away from the mechanism keeping us out.

“We can still leave.” Ryan said. But he didn’t move. Didn’t walk away like he suggested. I slid the key in, it was almost too smooth. Fit too perfectly. I slowly turned the tumblers. The click was loud in the silence. Final. 

I pushed the door in. It swung inward slowly, revealing darkness. The dreary daylight stopped at the threshold, afraid to go further. The air that drifted out was cold and stale and smelled like dust and something else. Something sweet and rotting. Just inside, I could make out a hallway, and a staircase leading upwards. The top of which was blocked off by furniture.  A doorway to a kitchen maybe. Faded wallpaper with a pattern I half recognized. Photographs on the walls. Children’s faces. There had to be dozens of them. From here I could only see faces in frames. I couldn’t quite make out any features. It sent the wildest chill up my spine.

“Do you see—“ Ryan started to ask.

“Yeah. I see them.” One step. All I had to do was take one step forward to cross into this familiar unknown house. As we stepped inside, the floor boards creaked under my chucks. The temperature dropped immediately, so far down we could see our breath fogging in front of us. We stood there, frozen, in the doorway for a moment. The wallpaper was a floral pattern. Roses that might have once been bright red, but now just dark red like dried blood. 

The floorboards were dark, scuffed and worn down the center as if generations of children walked this same path. But the photographs on the wall quickly grabbed our attention. I moved closer to one specific frame. A group of five children stood in front of the house, arms around each other. Happiness spread across their faces. Ryan walked a little further down.

“Jay,” he said, “Jay, look.” It was another picture of the three of us in this exact hallway. I was in a t-shirt I couldn’t remember owning. I could make out the wallpaper in the background. Luke in between the two of us, his arms around us. He looked so happy. 

“When was this taken?” Ryan asked. “I don’t remember this. Jay, I don’t remember being here.” I reached out to touch the frame, but fingers hovered an inch away from the glass. Ryan slowly moved down the hallway, examining more photos. “There’s more of us.” I made my way through each frame. One of us sitting at a kitchen table eating. I peered my head through the doorway into the kitchen. Same table. Same chairs.

A different picture showed us all laying in bunk beds, fast asleep. 

“What the fu….” The words drifted softly out of my mouth. One picture of Luke standing alone at the top of the stairs. He looked sad and a little afraid. Something was carved into the wooden frame. 

*CAME BACK CAME BACK*. 

As I examined further, I realized that these stairs weren’t the ones we passed on the way in. There was no wallpaper, just plain exposed brick. Wooden slats for stairs rather than ornate and decorative hand cut stairs. The only light in the photo was coming from behind Luke.

“Hey, take a look around. See if there’s a door to a basement or something.” I asked him.

“Yeah…sure.” He replied. While he looked, I walked into the kitchen. I scanned around, taking in familiar sights I shouldn’t remember. One of the cupboards called to me. I stepped over to it and opened it, revealing old 90s tableware. For some reason, one of them piqued my interest more than the others. It was white, with a red ornate pattern flowing around the inner edge. I picked it up and looked it over for a minute, running my fingers along the raised decorative design. A subtle warmth flowed through my body. A specific kind of nostalgia you’d only feel for something that held fond memories. But it left me as something fell from the counter, hitting the floor with a metallic *clinkclinkclink*. I looked down. 

A kitchen knife lay alone on the dirty kitchen floor tiles. The sight of it made my skin crawl. It beckoned to me, causing my head to spin. The discomfort of it forced me to turn away. I fell back into the warmth of the plate. I walked back to examine the photo of us at the table. All three of us ate from different plates. And I held the exact same plate I was eating from in the photo.  “Jay! Over here!” I walked over and set the plate down on the table, and headed over to where I heard Ryan calling from.

As I rounded the corner, he was standing in front of a wooden door, darker than even the front door. Old and in pretty rough shape. There was a  cross crudely carved above a latch. There was no handle to turn to gain entry. The latch was all that stood between us and whatever was behind the door. I raised my hand and lifted the latch. The draft from below pulled the door inward, revealing stairs that led down into a deep darkness. The kind that swallowed up everything it touched. Wooden steps, steep and narrow. The same brick walls from the photo enclosed the space, and the mast sweet smell grew stronger.

At the bottom of the stairs, there was a faint red glow. Flickering, like candle flames almost. My mind was trying to make out shapes in the darkness. Faces, full apparitions, anything to fill the void.

I took the first step down, and the wooden plank bent slightly downward and creaked loudly. Ryan followed close behind me. My hands trailed on the bricks as we descended - rough, cold and damp. For a moment I thought I felt lettering, and the soft glow from the bottom of the stairs just barely gave insight to what the walls had to tell me. *remember remember remember* As I traced further down the stairs, the handwriting changed. Different hands, different tools. *he did this he’s always watching*.

The basement itself was larger than it should have been. I traced the glow over to a small wooden structure in the corner. Three candles sat on it, burning bright red flames tall and still despite the cold air. Through the light I could make out what looked like a crucifix. I couldn’t help but feel pulled in by it. The longer I looked at it the more uncomfortable I became, but I kept walking towards it. I kept passing objects that sent ringing through my head. Toys. Sleeping bags. A mattress with an odd stain on it, blankets curled up at the bottom of it. And the smell. The chemical-sweet smell penetrated every receptor in my nose. My nostrils burned and my head spun, but I could only progress forward. Ryan stayed back at the bottom of the stairs, likely in shock from the scene unfolding before him. 

The crucifix at the altar was intricate and ornate. Ordained in red glow from the candles, I could make out exceptional craftsmanship. And the savior nailed to it, his expression of agony and silent despair cut through my soul. As I gazed, the proportions began to shift. An arm longer than it should be. Hands with too many fingers. Too many teeth inside of his gaping mouth. And the blood from the crown. The blood was actually flowing. Pumping in rhythm with my own heart rate. 

Tears welled in my eyes and slowly ran down my cheeks. Was I afraid? Was I soothed? The strangest concoction of emotions washed over me as I felt frozen by this thing. I noticed that one flame was burning significantly weaker than the other two. The wax burned down to its holder. That flame couldn’t burn much longer, but the wax surrounding its base made it look like it had been burning for decades.

“JAY!” Ryan screamed. My name pierced my ears and brought me out of whatever held me there. I turned quickly, only to see a figure standing behind him and a black gloved hand reaching around and covering his face. An abundance of fingers covered Ryan’s face from chin to forehead. Just one of his wide frightened eyes was uncovered, peering through the spindly appendages. He let out a short muffled screams through the hand as the other traced down his abdomen. Its wet ragged breathing, through some kind of cloth and deep red metal haphazardly wrapping around its skull, sent waves of fear through my bones as they echoed though the basement. It placed one hand behind his back. Barbed wire slithered around Ryan’s midsection and constricted. Barbs setting into his skin. As if he weighted nothingt heaved him easily directly over its head in one frighteningly swift motion. Ryan frantically kicked and flailed, trying desperately to escape. He let out fierce painful wails,

“LET ME GO WHAT THE FUCK!” The creature’s proportions were normal, but it stood at least ten feet tall. Ragged makeshift clothes hung from its musculature, metal bands seeping out of holes torn in the fabric. It looked up at him and tilted its head, studying him for a moment. Pitying him. I felt sick and my vision started to tunnel, but I sprang towards it, thinking maybe I could stop it. I had to do something. Anything. 

“LET HIM GO!” My voice cracked, raw with terror. But as I foolishly attempted to ram into it with my shoulder, it used its free hand to catch me by the throat. My feet left the ground as it lifted me up. Looking me right in my eyes, it leaned forward. Hot, wet and rotten breath flowed across my face as it loomed right in front of me. I balled up my fist, and launched a decent hook into its face. Pain splintered through my hand, and that thing didn’t even flinch. 

It reared me back like a major league pitcher. I felt the ground grow further from my feet. It launched me across that basement like a child angry at a doll. Time slowed. I could see the candles at the altar flicker at the sudden burst of wind. I soared an impossible distance, straight through the air. The crack of my bones colliding with the bricks sent bursts of bright hot pain through my body. I crashed hard into the dirt, the air knocked completely out of my lungs in one big gasp. Painfully, I raised my head, and tried to call out for Ryan. I could only let out a wheeze as I watched that thing drag Ryan off into the distance.

The darkness on the edge of my vision closed in and I felt my head hit the hard dirt. I tried to fight it, but I didn’t last long. That darkness in my eyes fully consumed me.

As I write this down, I still don’t know what to think. Has anyone else had any strange experiences? Like this? 
The weirdest part…I can’t find this town on any maps. I’m gonna do more research. Be back soon.
