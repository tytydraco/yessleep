My life was at an all time low when these events took place. I was in deep depression and my father had recently passed away. Dad had always been my caring parent… he always made time to talk when I had a pressing matter and needed his advice. He was always upbeat, offering practical advice and encouraged me. My mother, on the other hand, never had a good thing to say and would belittle me whenever she had the chance. Later in my life I came to realize she was probably jealous of me.

I was an honors student attending a well known university at the time. It took a great deal of effort to continue my studies and not dropout. I didn’t have any really close friends. The program I had enrolled was extremely challenging and took up all my time. While other students were able to enjoy a social life, I simply didn’t have the time. It was the end of my junior semester when I took a required course that my troubles began. I had been warned about the professor but didn’t really have a choice in the matter. It became obvious during his second lecture that this professor enjoyed making his students’ lives miserable. He told us he didn’t think any of us had what it took to be successful but he would do his best to enlighten us. He loved to give pop quizzes every week. On top of that his lectures and homework didn’t help prepare for his impossible exams. He spoke quickly during lectures, a piece of chalk in one hand and eraser in the other, as he quickly scribbled one long equation after another on the big chalkboard. We were also required to memorize hundreds of formulas.

When he was handing out our graded midterms I saw that I had received a very middling score but at least hadn’t failed. I was extremely worried how this class could adversely affect my scholarship, as I was required to maintain a high grade point average. I took the exam home and that evening looked it over. Quickly I grew frustrated, realizing many of my answers had been incorrectly graded. The next day I went to see the professor so I could bring this to his attention. I waited outside his office for over an hour. He was quite late to return and glowered at me as he headed towards me. "What do you want?" he asked briskly as he unlocked the door to his office. I explained to him my work on the exam had been incorrectly graded. By my calculations I should have scored a high grade. He sat down and rolled his eyes at me, then he invited me to sit down and explain that a graduate student had graded the midterms.

He listened in silence as I went through the problems and even laughed a couple of times. If I had only known a graduate student had graded my exam I could have avoided this meeting. The professor took my exam and put it away, inside his wooden desk. He looked at me for quite awhile, not saying anything. It felt extremely awkward as I sat there. Finally he said he’d speak to the graduate student. I thanked him as I stood up and got ready to leave. Just as I was stepping out the professor asked me if I was interested in doing some work for extra credit. Without hesitating I said yes, then he told me I could come to his home the following evening at a specific time and gave me his address.

I didn’t think about it that much right at the moment but over the course of the evening I realized that maybe what the professor had asked was inappropriate. I went to bed and did not sleep well. The next morning when I woke up I felt quite anxious. I really didn’t like how he had been looking at me while I plead my case regarding the midterm. It felt like he was looking up and down my body over and over as he sat there in utter silence.

I didn’t eat much that day nor had much of an appetite. I attended my classes and had a hard time concentrating. Many times I caught myself obsessing over having to meet the professor again. Finally it came time to go. I got my backpack and climbed on my bike. At least the weather was nice as I rode my way into the elite neighborhood. My professor lived in a large two story house located at the back of a long cull de sac. I parked my bicycle beside an expensive looking sports coupe and then walked up the driveway to the front door. I had to ring the doorbell several times then finally I heard the door unlock to be greeted by my professor.

He lead me into his living room and asked me to have a seat on a big leather couch. I smelled alcohol on his breath, although he didn’t act like he was drunk. He sat down across from me on another couch. "I’m glad you could make it." he said and grinned. "So I’ve had some time to look over your midterm. I’m aware you’re one of our honor students. That said are you aware it’s hard for women to succeed in highly technical roles?" He sat there with his big grin.

Immediately I informed him I had a xeroxed copy of my midterm and had spoken to the graduate student that graded the midterms. Suddenly he stopped grinning. "Well good for you." he finally  replied after a long awkward moment. He then told me my grade would be corrected and I left.

That moment felt so good. I ended up passing the course with the highest grade in the class and slowly my depression lifted by the end of the semester. Unfortunately that’s not the end of this story.  I ended up enrolling in summer school so I’d have a chance to graduate early. Summer is a time when there are few people on campus in the college town. Over the course of the first summer session I began to notice seeing the professor. I always kept my distance and avoided speaking with him. I should mention he was quite a big man and really stuck out in a crowd. He had a big round belly and huge muscled arms. Every time I spotted him, I caught him looking straight at me and he was always frowning.

One evening ,while I was passing through the small downtown area on my way home after leaving the library, I sensed someone was following me. I stopped at an intersection waiting for a car to pass by and looked back behind me. There he was, the professor, only a few feet back but now he had that evil grin of his again. Immediately I ran to a nearby coffee shop and went inside. The shop was empty except for one worker standing behind the till. I ordered a hot tea and sat down at a small table close to the counter.

hIn came the professor. He sat down close to the door, watching me the whole time. The server brought me my tea and then informed me she had to step out for a few minutes as she hurried out. The professor laughed as soon as she left then a Miles Davis song started playing on the speakers. The door opened again as another man entered the coffee shop. He looked at me but he had a kind reassuring look. "I need to speak to you right now." I heard him tell the professor. The professor broke his hard gaze as he looked up. "Right now!" said the man, grabbing him by the arm. There was a brief scuffle as he pulled the professor up and marched him outside.

I remained seated and listened. I could hear a commotion just past the closed door. I heard the professor yell but couldn’t make out what he said. Several minutes passed then the man stepped back into the shop. I could see he had a fresh bruise on his face but he looked quite calm. Again he looked my way with that kind smile. "He can’t bother you any more now." he said then left. I finished my tea then got up and left as well.

I never saw the professor again and was able to graduate that fall. I was never able to find out who that man was but affectionately call him Mr. Bill whenever I tell this story.
