Let’s just say things didn’t play out as expected.Peter came back. He looked... different this time. Instead of his regular fancy-schmanzy suits, neat hair, and leather shoes, he wore a baggy white shirt with stains on it. The stains were red and black, and it looked like he wiped his hands down his shirt on both sides. His hair looked messy and uncombed. His evil grin and “heh heh heh”-complexion were still the same, though. He also had some black smudgy stuff wiped down his neck.

As always, he came up to my desk and did his evil “heh heh heh”-grin. I knew he would come back, but instead of being scared, I felt nothing. My head suddenly started pounding with stinging sensation and the strange, sulfury taste in my mouth grew stronger. I just aggressively stared at him, trying my best to look unphased (as I do with most of my ER patients who tell me the stories of how they got their injuries) and asked, “What do you want.” with a deadpan face. It didn’t even sound like a question, more like a statement. He stood there, grinned in such a wide way that it almost looked like those creepypasta-grins you normally see in horror stories, or like the skeleton in that animated Halloween movie (I forgot the name but anyways). His breath stank so horribly of sulfur I nearly vomited.

I asked again: “what.”, sounding more firm, but still looking deadpanned. Then I slightly raised my eyebrows and tilted my head forward a little, in a way to show I was expecting an answer.He said “I want to make you an offer. One that you can NOT refuse.”I leaned back in my chair and crossed my arms. Then I raised my right eyebrow even higher then my left one. I tried to look very calm, but I didn’t feel calm. I wanted to strangle him.I said nothing but he continued. “You can have Travis back. when I get my dough, and my dope!”Oh right. Money. Why else would you kidnap an insurance broker. I guess that reddit user’s suggestion was right. He kidnapped Travis to get money. Or to torture me. Or both.

“What on earth are you talking about”, I said, trying not to show my frustration and anger.“*The devil inside needs his fodder! Give the devil his food right now*, and I’ll give your Travis another chance to sign. All he needs to do is to triple my life insurance.”The words in italics sounded deeper and more evil than the rest of what he said.Alright. So it WAS the money. But what did he mean by “devil inside”?I just decided to ask because what could possibly go wrong. “What devil?”Peter suddenly dropped to his knees like a wet sack. His throat made noises like a choking monster in a horror movie (again). At this point, he looked like a junkie who desperately needed his shot of heroine.Just then, Sam came around the corner. “Melissa, I need you to- HOLY CRAP.” He saw Peter and then flinched and stopped mid-sentence.

Peter turned to Sam and grinned at him. “That’s right. *HOLY.* Heh heh heh heh. Well well well. If it isn’t Samuel Conradson the great? The HOLY Doctor Who, who gave me my special abilities. My devil’s fodder” He then abruptly switched to a deeply serious face and tone of voice. *“I’m outta dope. Give me more.”*Sam looked at him. “Peter, look... I’m sorry. I can’t keep doing this. I CAN’T give you the evil potion injections anymore-“

Peter mockingly made a face. “I’m sorry. I’M SORRY. Beh.” during those last two words, he gesticulated theatrically and in a mocking way. “I’m sorry, eh. And who is sorry about my dear father? He’s gone forever. YOU jerks made him die! I didn’t sue your asses under ONE condition. All you had to do is provide me with my dope. And I want my dope NOW!!”Sam exasperatedly (but professionally) said, “I told you, I won’t keep doing this. I can’t make more of that squidge and keep giving it to you! I’ll risk my license if I do! If anyone finds out about that I’ve been doing this, I’m risking my neck!”Squidge? License?Did Sam know what the weird black stuff was that has been mysteriously appearing everywhere and where it came from?“Awwwww, you’ll lose your license? You know what I’LL lose if you don’t give it to me?”, Peter continued talking with the mocking concerned expression and tone. I’ll lose my home, my car, AND my will to live! And YOU, are going to lose your LIFE, if you don’t give it to me *this instant*!”“Peter... please. I can’t make more of that. I lied for you once, I won’t do it again. I said you had a psychosis and that I gave you a normal IV! I even removed you from the patient files so no one will suspect anything! I don’t have access to the dark web anymore!”So that’s why Peter didn’t show up in the records. Sam must have given him something other than an IV. And also... Sam never told me what was in **my** IV the other day.Wait. What did he give me that day I wrote about in part 2? ... I felt sick.It’s like they totally forgot I was there. I still had one thought, though: I had to grab Peter’s phone somehow. I noticed it was hanging out of his pocket halfway. Just one strong move or jump from him and it would fall out and I could grab it. He was still on his knees – actually it would be enough if he just stands up really quick.  Little later, my wish became fulfilled.“Samuel Conradson. You better do as I say. I have no problem doing to you what I did to this mouse...” He reached into his pocket and then pulled out a dead mouse. Its legs were missing. *“I chopped them off.”*

Suddenly I thought of the video again. He said that to Travis too.Peter got up and dangled the mouse right into Sam’s face to provocate him. This led his phone to fall out his pocket.Without thinking, I jumped up and grabbed the phone as fast as I could.Before Peter noticed, I was on my way. The security guard came running into the lobby to apprehend Peter and take the mouse away.“*NO, SAM! NO*!” my voice sounded weirdly deep, as if it wasn’t me. Like that “AAAAAA” that slipped out of me earlier the other, without me being able to control it. It felt like I was being remote-controlled. The same way it felt as I suddenly got up from my chair, walked across the hospital lobby (I didn’t want to, my body just started moving by itself). It was in a similar way as my arm just randomly pointed into a direction as I came here.

I impulsively jumped and grabbed Peter’s phone as fast and tight as I could and then ran away. I made my way to the exit. I didn’t think anymore. I just ran without thinking about consequences. I ran into the direction my arm pointed into earlier. I desperately looked for somewhere to hide, while feeling my other arm wanting to point in directions constantly. It was the same sensation I had the other day when my arm suddenly pointed into a direction, and I felt the sudden urge to run in that direction (I told you in part 3). It was like I was being remote-controlled.

I instinctively followed my sensations and ended up under an old chapel-like building. I saw a sign with toilet icons and ran towards the door to hide in the ladies’ room. A toilet would be the safest place to be right now.I locked the loo door and launched peter’s phone. Shit. I didn’t know his passcode. Maybe he’d use his dad’s birthday from the patient records? 3-3-1940. Bingo. It was unlocked. Now I opened the photo gallery to look for some hints for where Travis was. If he showed me videos, he surely would have them saved somewhere. ...

I tried my luck with his whatsapp. Surely he’d told someone about his evil plans at some point. To my surprise, the latest person he texted was “Sam Conradson”. I tapped on the contact and read the conversations dating back to 2018. My hands were shaking and I was hyperventilating as I scrolled. I first read the most recent ones.

*I got the insurance guy. His stupid ass sister doesn’t know where he is. Nobody will ever find him down there.Make sure the basement is locked and people can’t hear him. The old guy from the convenience store is already suspicious* (basement, alright. And wait.. I know that store. I think I know which one. There’s one by the mosaic – owned by an old man.)Thinking I finally had a clue, I decided to scroll up futher read more messages before heading off.Sam said *“I got it. Clay, mercury, sulfur, wax, - perfect devil’s mixture. I make the stuff and sell it on the dark web. I’ll give it to you when you need it.”*Peter replied: *“Fine. You get me this stuff every week now, and I won’t sue the hospital over Dad’s death. Deal?”*Sam responded *“Deal.”*To which Peter added: *“There’s one more thing, though. I bought a house last year. I can’t quite afford it. You have to help me.”*Sam: *“Help you? How?”*Peter: *“Your receptionist lady has a brother that works for the life insurance. He’s the one who handled dad’s testament case. And the one with dad’s life insurance. He said I would only get 50k. that’s not enough to cover my mansion and my car. I need more life insurance, but he refused. Do you ... know anything about that cephalexin stuff? The pills that I saw on his desk during our insurance appointment?”*Sam: *“It’s a strong antibiotic. Prescribed to treat infections. Why?”*Peter: *“Can you also... die from it?”*Sam: *“well, not per se. But it causes psychoses fairly often. I know Ms. Windwell’s brother took it and then had one.”*Peter: *“I got a plan.”*Sam: *“??”*Peter: *“If that insurance bloke doesn’t give me more money, I’ll make him. I can never pay off my debt with those lousy 50k he wants to give me. Insurances make enough money, they can give me more. I want 150k. If I make it appear like he’s dead, no one will look for him anymore. I’ll torture him until he does what I want. it can get me some more time to pay off my debts. How does that sound?”*

I wanted to throw up. Peter STAGED Travis’s death just so he could get his hands on more money? What a rotten thing to do.At least now I knew where Sam was in the plot. The sulfury black squidge. The same stuff that Jason had. Is Jason... also injected with it? and I am??? No. I can’t be, can I?I opened Peter’s photo gallery. The videos he showed me were still on it. Asshole. I clicked on the most recent one. It showed a basement with a latticed window. Through the window, I could briefly see an intersection with a recognizable mosaic next to it. wait. I knew where that was. I KNEW. I had to go there right away.I decided to make a run for it. But wait. I couldn’t just run off and go. What if Peter had left the hospital too and was looking for me? I waited a few minutes. Then I slowly opened the toilet door and went outside. I had to go find Peter’s dad’s basement.As soon as I exited the chapel toilet, suddenly I felt this stinging sensation in my head again. My arm moved on its own again and pointed in a direction. I followed the direction my arm pointed into. It kept pointing in different directions and something inside me made me run faster and faster. I couldn’t even do anything about it. I just went along with what my body told me to.There it was. After 5 minutes, I arrived at what seemed to be an old, abandoned mansion. It was right across the street from the mosaic. There was a green, wooden, tiny, Victorian style door at the bottom left corner of the building. Impulsively, I ran towards it. My body moved on its own. I didn’t even want to. The door handle was bolted from the outside. I removed the bolt and pushed the door open.It looked like a dungeon. It reeked of mildew. Old, white-grey walls. I closed the grren door behind me and looked around. No one was here. I slowly and sneakily walked through the corridor. Suddenly I jumped at the sound of a man groaning. I froze. I didn’t move for a while. Then I heard it again. This time, it sounded like wailing. I decided to walk towards the source of the sound. Suddenly I heard a man screaming really loudly and frantically. “MMMMMMMM! MmmmMMMMMMMmmmm!” The voice sounded familiar. I followed it. But I remained quiet, just in case someone else was there.I snuck across the putrid old corridors, which looked like a typical house basement. The type of basement you’d expect to see underneath a highrise. I went across a corner, and I came to a big, black metal door. I unbolted it and carefully pressed it open. “MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!! RRRRRRRRRRRHHHH!” Now the screaming was very loud.

I carefully and slowly pried the door open. It was dark. I saw the latticed window – it was the first thing I saw. I looked around for a light switch and just found an old lightbulb on a chain next to me. I pulled it, and the light went on. What I saw then made me want to piss myself.I saw a man tied up on a mattress, with a dirty cloth in his mouth. There was blood, sweat, dirt and ungodly liquids all over him and the mattress. But there was sth else.“Holy God, TRAVIS!!”, I exclaimed, running towards him. He cried and tried looking up at me through teary eyes. I could tell he wanted to talk to me, but his mouth was stuffed, and he was in shackles, so he struggled to only communicate with me through his eyes. I looked around for something to loosen the shackles. But first thing I did was take the cloth out of his mouth. It was soaking wet and full of dirt. “Jesus!”, I said and then disgustedly threw the cloth across the room.Travis then cried out loud and couldn’t stop crying at all. He couldn’t bring out any words. Who knows how long he’d been down here. He probably hadn’t been able to open his mouth for eternities.I noticed a sharp object poking out from under the mattress (which was full of blood, dirt, and even piss, it looked the kind of thing you’d expect to be sold on craigslist) I pulled it to the front and realized it was a pair of garden shears. I grabbed it and attempted to cut the shackles. They were super rusty. I had a hard time, but I somehow managed to cut them open. Eventually, I removed the shackles from his legs and arms. “Travis...” I didn’t know what to say. I was exasperated. He looked traumatized as hell. I didn’t want to know what he had been through and for how long. “M-Melissa. ...” he wanted to start saying something, but then he abruptly stopped. He was trying to find words. But instead, he just fell around my neck and started crying like a baby. Yuuuuuck he stank. He didn’t losen his grip at all for a good half minute, then he let go and my scrubs were all smudged. I didn’t even want to imagine what he had been through the last 5 years. I wanted to cry too.I was just about to tell him “let’s get out of here. I’ll get you to my place” when suddenly we heard steps from the corridor. Shit, I thought. He came back. Peter is back. When he sees this, he will kill the both of us.The steps came closer. They became louder. They came towards the door. They stopped at the door. I was still hugging my brother, with my back towards the door. I couldn’t see who was there. I didn’t want to turn around. But suddenly I had this stinging in my head again, and my body turned itself to the door. I saw the intruder.

But to my surprise, JASON stood in the doorframe.“What the actual fuck....?” That was all I could bring out of myself. I couldn’t believe it. What was he doing here and where the hell had he been the last days? “Jason!”He sure had some explaining to do.I didn’t understand anything anymore.Jason flinched when he saw me. “Melissa!”

Travis said “Jason?!”

Jason said “Travis!!”

It was like one of those movie scenes where people suddenly ran into each other and surprisedly screaming each other’s names.I had to clear things up. Right now. I nearly started crying. “Jason, what the heck’s going on? where have you been? What is this stuff you’ve been ? and why are you HERE?!”Jason grinned. But not in the way I knew him. It was no lomger a funny grin. It was an evil sadistic grin.“I never wanted anything bad to happen to you, Melissa...”, he began. “But I was forced to do this.”He reached into his pocket and pulled out a rusty knife. He grinned so widely that he almost looked like Jack Skellington.Travis let go of me and quickly crawled back to the corner of the basement, to run away from Jason. He extended one arm in defense, yelling "Get away!"I couldn't move. I felt paralyzed. Jason came closer to me, the grin still on his face. I could only sit there and not do anything. When he was right in front of me, he kneeled down to face me. He breathed into my face in a hyperventilating way. He reeked ... of sulfur. I had to do something. But what?Impulsively, I punched Jason on the nose as hard as I could. "Get away from me, you PSYCHO!!"

Blood came out of Jason's nose. But it wasn't blood. It was black, slimey stuff that stank of sulfur and clay.Jason blinked a couple times, then wiped his nose with his hand. He was shocked. "Huh? My... my nose!" he suddenly seemed normal again.He saw the black stuff on his hand and shockedly bounced his head back.He looked at me, then at Travis, then at me again. Then he saw the open door. "Let's get out of here! I’ll explain later!" without thinking, me and Travis followed, and we ran down the corridors towards the green door that I came in through.

But there was already the next surprise. From a distance, we could see Peter. Peter saw me, angrily pointed at me, and then came running after us. We ran back to the chapel toilet and squished ourselves into a ladies’ room cabin with 3 people.We all breathed heavily. None of us said anything. There were a few moments of awkward silence. Suddenly, Jason said “I sent that text.”

“What?”, I asked.

“It was me. I pretended to be your brother so you could call me at 3am. 3am is the devil’s hour. It’s when evil and paranormal activity are at their highest. I thought that was the best time to summon the demons and get rid of them.”

“So why did you ask me to call you?”

“Sam started it. He has been selling stuff on the dark web for years. He made this new... potion, that he injects that guy with every week. It included some demonic shit like sulfur and clay and some other stuff. I caught him doing it once, he said it was a novel IV treatment. I once tried it myself without asking because I had a really bad hangover. You know, being a nurse and all, I wanted to cure it that way. But since then... the hangover hasn’t gone away. I got these stinging headaches, and didn't feel like myself. I felt like I was... remote-controlled or something. I made an appointment with Sam because I thought I had a brain tumor. I mentioned that I scooped some black IV stuff and injected myself with it, and he completely flipped. He said that stuff was not meant for me, and that I should stay away from it. I asked why, he told me it was for this guy only and why. I didn't want any trouble with him, so I helped him inject that weird old guy regularly. and I... have done some other bad things." Jason ignored my shocked face and just continued talking.“

But there was something strange. At around 3am, the symptoms always got... worse. My breath stank extremely. I breathed on my roommate and he fainted from it. and I couldn’t control myself. I felt like ... someone else was inside me. I randomly dropped to the floor and puked black stuff. I wanted to do evil shit. It randomly stopped later and I could never remember it the next day ...”

I glanced over at Travis, who stared blankly at the toilet stall door without even batting an eye. It must have been the trauma. I thought it might be better for him to leave the stall. I would definitely take him home with me and give him a bath & clean clothes and get him a therapist, and take a few days off to take care of him now. But first, I had to know what was going on. I wanted to reach for Peter's phone in my scrubs' pocket for more information.

But I suddenly noticed I didn't have Peter's phone in my pocket anymore. I must have dropped it while saving Travis.

I also noticed my own phone buzzing. It had a new message. "Next time you will NOT wake up, Melissa."
