This is a short 100% true story. 
I was walking around in the forest, I'm talking real deep into the forest. Just me and my teenage friend. No way out. We were alone with no phone signal or any weapons. We walked for about 30 minutes. A hard to find, easy to get lost isolated place deep within. 

On the way to the forest, we saw a gothic couple making out on the grass. I got scared because I saw a man alone on the grass just sat there, watching us from afar. It turns out the goth girl is with him. 

After seeing many grafitti symbols on walls, I came across this strange "hangout" in the woods near the trees. A very quiet and silent eerie place. It turns out this place had been turned into what looked like a ritual circle. Not a sound could be heard, not even a bird flying over. It was a strange sort of silence. "What is this place?" I ask him. "I don't know. It feels like we shouldn't be here. Somebody doesn't want us here."

There were cigarette butts all over the floor, a ton of empty soda cans too and trash all over the place. It was being used to sit down, chill and have a drink. In the middle centre was a burned campsite fire and beside it a cars tire.

 There was a nail forcefully placed into the big tree in the middle centre, with what me and my friend suggested was or looked like real red liquid blood. Fresh, crimson and glistening like it had just been taken out of someone's body. My friend used his hand and without hesitance went to touch it, and said "Yeah. That isn't tree sap. That's blood." To me it looked real. He gasped in shock, telling me that he thinks this is real. Real blood. So we got freaked out by this. My friend tasted it. I thought to myself "What the hell?"  The blood pooled around the nail used for DIY projects, into the heart and dagger of the trees soul. It formed a dark and sticky puddle in a light red shade. The tree pained at the foreign object stuck into its dagger, begging me to take it out. I could not take it out, as I didn't want to catch a disease from the real blood. 

We saw bandages and ropes hanging all around the tree going from that tree to the next one. They were all criss-crossed as a X shape to symbolize something.
 In a loose row the ropes dangled from tree to tree. Eventually we started to get lost. 

We both felt a chilling presence in the air like somebody, or something, was watching us. On the opposite side, a similar hiding area of a smaller circle replica is what I could see, but there were birds nests at the top. It was much cleaner. I know that the Japanese suicide forest uses ribbons to get themselves out to know the way, should they decide not to die. 

My friend says "This place gives me the creeps. We should go." So I agreed and we both left in a hurry. "This could be a crime scene. We don't know who may of died here." He says to me. We ran straight out of there, down the easy to fall or die slope, and through many bushes with one steep river.
