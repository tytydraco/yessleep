cryptid town or **cryptid** town?

apparition on the 5th.

exit ramps lead nowhere.

when you turn a corner by the park, the city manor changes color.

be quiet between 11:50 to 12:10.

some cats speak in the park.

never listen to them after dark.

If you hear a siren, lock your door and smash all your mirrors.

The County Board provides mirrors every ten days.

Any reflection you see when you have no mirrors should be killed.

They replace you if you don't.

If you believe you know someone whose real safe got replaced, report to the town sheriff.

The town sheriff manipulates cases and hides the truth.

You do not have a dog.

No matter how many barks you hear at night.

YOU DO NOT HAVE A DOG.

Cockroaches can be killed again... but, wear ear protectors if you do not want your fears to be told. You do not hav-

They live in your house.

And they hate you.

THEY HATE YOU.

Sometimes you can pet them. Sometimes you can be them.

I know you.

Do you know the cove?

I saw you there last time, I think.

You were sad, though.

But, I get it.

The bone pile was not as impressive as last year's.

I just wish they scavenged more.

We left zombies to run our society.

But, thing is, they like the filth.

The filth is tasty.

The filth nourishes.

The filth is starving.

Dark filth.

Dark filth.

Dark fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-oh

You're still here. Sorry, the filth can give adverse effects to your spine. Some symptoms of derealization, here and there. General hopelessness and limbo.

You are stuck here.

With me.

On this town.

And, you have no escape.

The town knows that. We all know that. We all voted for it.

You can go to your terrace, though.

The night sky is wonderful.

It is so bright.

And, sunny.

And, so fresh.

So fresh... like the corpse you dig everyday. But, a zombie. 

A corpse-digging zombie. Some irony of the macabre. A **zimbo**. Not a zombie but, a conscious one.

That's why I stood by you when we were on top of the shrine.

You let me fall for that.

It hurt.

But... you don't bring pain to heaven, though.

Or, hell or whatever this is where we are.

I love it best when the mountains howl.

They sang Winter Sonata yesterday.

And, I swear to you. I swear - all the frogs disappeared.

They claim biology teachers used all of them for *lab dissections*.

But, you see dried frog legs in restaurant menus.

You see them pleading for forgiveness.

Forgiveness.

Please forgive us.

We never should have taken the siren.

We never should have taken your sun.

The empire is mighty, you know.

The empire is vast.

The empire... is airconditioned!

We hail from the same filth you called ancestors.

We made your cells.

You were never supposed to grow this fast. You were never meant to be evil. You, you were supposed to be terrified of your hair, your eyes, your muscles.

Those are vestigial. Military grade parts.

But, you were never supposed to be violent with them!

You were supposed to be gentle. To be caring. To be innocent.

Evil should not have gotten you.

But, here you are.

Filth.

Perhaps, I'll abandon you to rot.

But, I need a permit for that.

This quadrant is galactically quarantined.
