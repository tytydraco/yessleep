Okay. I admit it. I was rude. But I was tired. I’d just gotten off work and my sister, Jessica, called, panicking: “Please, can you watch Venny? It’s an emergency.”

I was exhausted, but I wanted to do my part. Prove that I was a dependable brother.  

My sister had just gone through a painful divorce, and was barely treading water. I figured, why the hell not? I’ll help.

So, that afternoon, I went to the park with Venny. Settled on a bench. Watched her play.

I could barely keep my eyes open as she ran around.

Out of the corner of my vision, I noticed a boy alone at the swings.

He seemed so miserable and dejected. His eyes pointed at the ground.

My heart ached just looking at him. So I waved, hoping to spread some joy into his little heart.

The kid noticed me, waved back. It was the first time I realized —

— he had clown makeup all over his face. It was old. Worn. Like it hadn’t been washed off in days.

“That’s odd,” I thought. Turned my attention back to Venny. She was teetering down a slide. Giggling.

A few seconds later, I heard footsteps.

“Will you play with me?”

It was the Clown Kid. He stared at me with deep, pleading eyes.

“Um…”

I craned my gaze for his parents. But no adults were paying attention to him. Everyone was busy watching their own children.    

“Sorry. I’m busy.”

“Pleeeeeeease.”

I pivoted to my phone, hoping to communicate that I wasn’t up for talking. But he just stood there, watching me.

This kid couldn’t have been more than five years old. He was adorable—little blonde with high cheekbones and a cute button nose. But his face was smeared in that old carnival makeup. It disturbed me.  

“Listen, I’m busy and I’ve got stuff to do. Why don’t you go find your mom and dad?”

“But I want to play with you.”

I pocketed my phone. Left the kid. Found Venny. Carried her to the swings.

I didn’t want to be rude, but my job was to take care of Venny and that was it.

Plus, I didn’t like it when random kids talked to me.

When Venny and I got to the swings, I glanced back to the bench.

The Clown Kid was still there, kicking the ground, like a lost boy without hope.

***

After a few minutes at the swings, I got a text from Jessica: “Interview’s taking longer. Can you watch Venny until dinner?”

“Sure,” I responded. “Hey, Venny. Want pizza?”

“Yes!”

I loaded Venny in the car. Moved for the driver’s seat.

“Shiiiiiit!” I screamed, clutching my chest with fright.

The Clown Kid was perched on the hood of my car, hugging his knees. Sobbing.

“You scared me,” I said. “Where are your parents?”

“Dead.”

What?!

I tightened my throat, a sense of unease creeping in.

“I’m calling 911.”

I yanked out my phone. Dialed the number.

“911. What’s your emergency?”

“Hi. I’m at the park next to the market. I have this kid that says he’s —“

I peeked inside the vehicle to make sure Venny was okay. She was playing with my tablet. Grinning.

When I turned back to check on the boy…

…he was gone.

“Sir, you still there?”

“Yes.” My voice cracked with confusion. “This kid’s —“

I raced around the car. Glanced up and down the street. Couldn’t find him anywhere.

“Hello?”

I peered inside the vehicle. Venny was still fiddling with the tablet.

“Hello—”

“Give me a second.”

I opened the door. Smiled at Venny. “Uncle Greg’s gonna go check on someone. Be right back.”

I locked the doors. Made sure the air conditioning was running. Hurried through the park.

It was a small area. I was shocked that I couldn’t see the boy anywhere. How far could a five year old get in a few seconds?

I asked an older couple, “Have you seen a boy about five years old? In clown makeup?”

They just stared at me like I was a psychopath.

I moved to a young mom, “Have you seen a little boy? Wearing clown makeup?”

She shook her head. “No.”

I asked everyone in the park. They all said the same thing. “Haven’t seen him.”

By now, the 911 operator was getting annoyed. “Sir, you said there’s a child —“

“Yes. There was a boy, but now he’s gone. I’m worried about him.”

“Stay on site. An officer is en route.”

I waited in the car with Venny. Praying for the police to arrive. When they finally did, I answered all their questions. Their interest piqued when I mentioned the boy’s parents were dead.

The officers seemed a little unnerved as they motioned me to go. “Thanks for all your help, Sir. You can leave now.”

As soon as I started to pull away, Jessica called. “Guess what! I got the job!”

“That’s wonderful!”

Finally, some good news.  

“Can you drop Venny off at my place?”

“Of course.”

I pulled away from the park. Drove Venny to her house. Then, left for my apartment.

When I got home, I tore off my clothes. Slipped into some shorts and a tank top.

I was tired and ready to put the day’s strangeness behind me. I flopped onto the couch. Opened my phone. Started browsing emails.

After an hour of relaxing, I heard knocking at the front door.

BUMP. BUMP. BUMP.  

Who’s that? I thought.

I wandered to the entry way. Peered through the eyehole.

No one was there.

Weird. I thought. Returned to the couch.

BUMP. BUMP. BUMP.  

“Hello?!”

I opened the door. Glanced up and down the hall.

Still…no one.

What the hell? I mused. Shut the door. Moved to my bedroom.

“Will you play with me?”

Jesus Christ!

I leapt back, almost suffering a heart attack.

There on my bed was —

— the Clown Kid —

— smiling at me —

“How’d you get in here?”

“I followed you.”

Followed me?!

By this point, I was so scared. Confused. I just wanted to get out of there.

“That’s it. We’re leaving.”

I took the Clown Kid by the hand. Led him towards the front door.

“Where are we going?”

“To the police station.”

I was so shell-shocked that I could barely utter any words.

I needed to find my keys. Get us in the car. And go.

I left the boy at the front door. Began searching. Where did I put them?

I ran to my desk. No luck.

Dove into the kitchen. All my regular key spots were empty.

“Looking for this?”

The kid’s voice came from the bathroom.

The bathroom?!

I dashed in toward his voice —

— found him standing at my toilet, dangling my keys over the bowl.

“Wait! What are you —“

SPLASH. He dropped them in.

I dashed forward. Yanked my keys out of the water.

“What the hell’s the matter with you?!” I screamed, my cheeks turning red.

The kid shrank back. Traumatized by my outburst.

I felt awful. This boy, even though he was strange and frightened me, still tugged at my heart strings. I knelt, softened my voice.

“I’m sorry. I just want to get you out of here and find help.”

The kid sniffed away a tear. “I thought you were nice. But you’re mean like everyone else…”

I wrapped my arms around his tiny shoulders. “I’m gonna get you some help. It’ll be okay.”

I patted his back softly, just like I always did with Venny.

I was too distracted to notice what he was doing with his hands.

As I embraced him, a burning sensation coursed through my body.

“Ahhh!”

I looked down.

A pair of scissors was buried into my ribs.

“What the —“

My eyes locked onto the Clown Kid’s furious gaze.

“You should’ve played with me.”

Frightened, I stumbled back. Slapped my hand on the wound. Blood seeping through my fingers.

I leapt up. Slammed the bathroom door shut. Sprinted to the kitchen. Poured peroxide over my cut.

“Oh god…” I gasped as the liquid ran over my wound. Stinging me.

BUMP. BUMP. BUMP. I could hear knocking on the bathroom door.

“Come on, Greg. Play with me!”

He knew my name?!

I pressed a rag to my side. Limped to the living room.

But somehow, the Clown Kid was already there, waiting for me. Screaming.

“My parents never played with me! I hated them! I hate you too!”

I sprinted for the door. I just wanted to leave. Climb into my car. Drive to the hospital. But then —

— a light hit me…my eyes spun…suddenly…

I was in another house. In another room. There was blood on the floor and furniture.

I was in a nursery. A man and woman were lying facedown in a pool of blood.

And a child, who looked like the Clown Kid but much younger, thrashed in his crib. Screaming at the top of his lungs.

“PLAY WITH ME! PLAY WITH ME!”

Another burst of light hit me. I fell back against the door.

I was back in my own living room —

— the Clown Kid was levitating toward me…scissors raised for a killing strike.

I pulled myself up. Burst out the door. Nearly tripping as I slammed into my car.

I leapt in. Gunned it down the road. Heading for the hospital. Delirious from blood loss.  

When I stumbled into the emergency room, I collapsed in a daze.

Hospital personnel swarming over me.

***

I was in the hospital for two nights. Now I’m at Jessica’s place.

I haven’t gone back to my apartment. Probably never will.

The police investigated everything. Didn’t find any signs of the Clown Kid. They’re not even sure he was real.

But Jesus…I know he was. I touched him with my own hands.

What was he? Demon? Human? Lost spirit sent to torment me?

Either way, I’m staying with my sister until things calm down.  

The only thing that keeps me sane is Venny. I care about her so much.

Now that Jessica has more hours at work, I get to help out more. Sure, it makes it hard to get work done, but that’s fine. I never liked my job anyway.

Besides, being with Venny gives me purpose. I take every opportunity I can to be with her.

Just this morning, Jessica offered me another babysitting opportunity, texting me:

“Can you watch Venny this afternoon? She’s really excited to show you her new playmate. She thinks you’ll like him.”
