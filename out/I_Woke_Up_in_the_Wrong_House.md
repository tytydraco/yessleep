Hey guys, I'm in a tricky situation right now that’s pretty tough to explain… or believe, really. I could use your help with something too unconventional for conventional help.

Well, maybe "help" is the wrong word? Honestly, I just want some proof. Proof that this post actually makes it to the outside world somehow, considering my strange circumstances. Forgive me if I’m a bit all over the place in this post. Still recovering from a very brain-frazzling day. I’ll be going to sleep once I post this.

If the title didn't already make things clear, I'll rewind a bit to elaborate some more. Last night I got home from the most boring videography job of my life. I didn’t have any weird dreams, at least none that I can remember right now. Honestly, it was some of the best sleep I’ve ever had in my life. (Don’t worry, the irony of where I’m posting this isn’t lost on me.)

I woke up to the sun peeling open my eyelids through my bedroom window. It took a few seconds, but I eventually realized I’d clearly *way* overslept. My window is on the westernmost wall, meaning the sun only shines through it later in the day. At this point all I wanted was some breakfast, so I left to do just that.

That’s when it became clear that I’ve arrived in a house that isn’t mine.

The hallway is shorter than the one in my place. What I assumed was my bathroom door was on the wrong side. There were different pictures on the wall than mine; these were just random nature photos. At the risk of sounding really crazy, I even think some spots on the wall where the paint dried looked… *different.* I can’t really explain how I know this other than it just felt really weird. Call it insanity or just intuition from getting so familiar with my home’s surroundings or whatever; for some reason it was just *wrong* on that deep a level for me.

Beyond the hallway’s end, I could see what I thought was a kitchen, but it definitely wasn’t mine. That wasn’t my kitchen. This wasn’t my house.

I turned back to my bedroom in fear that it disappeared as soon as I walked out of it. But to make things even more confusing, *it was still there,* completely unchanged.

I've made a thorough check to make sure there was nothing missing. Oddly, everything in my room is still in the right spot. Wherever I was now, it seems to have taken my bedroom – along with everything inside it (including myself) – right along with it. Even that one squeaky bit of floor that always annoyed me is still there.

The only thing to seem out of place in my bedroom is the view from my window. I can't see my neighbor’s roofs poking over their backyard fences. Instead, it's some kind of open field. From where I was looking, I can see the edge of some woods only about 100 meters away. To my right is the bank of what looks like a lake or pond – even though the nearest body of water where I live(d) is at least a twenty-minute drive away.

Before you ask, no, I didn’t explore the rest of the house yet. It took me maybe a full twenty minutes to force myself through that hallway. I got as far as the hallway’s end before hyperventilating and locking myself in my room.

I thought the familiarity would help. Honestly? It’s backfiring pretty damn hard. I know nothing beyond my bedroom door. Hell, I only recently noticed the time and realized I hadn’t overslept at all today. Meaning my bedroom window hasn’t been facing west since I woke up.

Not sure how, but the house does have power, so I was able to turn on my PC. Apparently, I somehow have an internet connection all the way out here… wherever “here” is. I *think* I can see a very faint, blinking red light outside my window above the trees? So maybe there’s a network tower out there? I tried calling the cops, but I don’t have any phone service here. Besides, I’m not sure what I’d even tell the authorities if I managed to get through to them anyway. I can barely believe it myself; how am I supposed to convince some random cop I woke up in a weird Bizarro house?

I haven’t left my room for a few hours now. Still haven’t eaten. Call me a coward all you like, I don’t care. I’m tired, I’m hungry and I’m alone. Part of me hopes this is just some kind of awful dream and I’ll wake up in no time, but the rest of me knows better. No clue why I’m so horribly certain that this is all real, but I do know that I won’t be able to sleep tonight unless I try *something.* Which is why I’m here.

I’m going to try looking through the rest of the house tomorrow. Guess I’m still hoping for the chance to wake up from this nightmare, even though I’m fairly positive that won’t happen. Feel free to leave a comment, even if you don’t have any suggestions or solutions for my situation. Any kind of human interaction would be insanely welcome right about now, so consider this post as a digital message in a bottle from a marooned man in a castaway house.

Sorry for the sudden downer tone, writing down everything about today really sapped what little was left of my energy. Going to bed now. I’ll look at the comments in the morning. Thanks for reading.



**UPDATE:** I forgot to post this last night and just passed out. Saved it as a draft instead. Just woke up a few minutes ago. 

This is not my bed.
