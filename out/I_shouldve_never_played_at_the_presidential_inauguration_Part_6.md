I stared down at the bottle.

“How did they get this bottle here?” I thought to myself.

I started sobbing, however, as me and my buddies have pretty much eaten Ethan, the kid who sacrificed himself for me. I looked at my phone, with the time being 9 AM. I called Aiden and Ernest to see what we could do next.

“Sorry, the person you’re dialing is not available” my phone said to me.

“Strange” I thought to myself.

I left them a text asking where they were, before leaving the room to grab a breakfast. But on my doorstep I saw a bag, with a note saying “Free breakfast!”

I figured it was a trap, but I was so hungry I grabbed it and took it inside, then I opened it, a big mistake.

A skull fell out of the bag, with glowing red eyes. I saw another note inside, I read it.

“Tom’s here!” 

I looked back, seeing the skull transform into Tom. I grabbed my things and ran out of the room, locking the door, but I heard my phone ring, I opened the notification, only to see a traumatizing image. Both Aiden and Ernest were bleeding blood from their eyes, with a huge smile. And one of those monsters were standing between them, and in the caption, it said “We got them, now Jonathan, we’re gonna get you too!”

I froze in fear. I was truly alone by myself, fortunately they left some money with me, so maybe I could make it home with the money they left me, so I did the math in the hotel lobby, looking at many charts, maps, and schedules, as well as seeing the price. I managed to find the most optimal path back home, as it barely managed to fit my budget. The path was this:

I would walk to Lexington, Kentucky, then in Kentucky I would be able to take a train to Chicago, then catch a connecting one to Madison. In Madison I would walk to Minneapolis, then take the final train back home. I know this isn’t the fastest way, but it’s the only way back home that fits my budget. So I started to walk to Lexington myself, but I suddenly felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned back and three new people were standing between me.

The first one was named Sam, who played baritone saxophone, you remember him, right? He was also quite tall, around 5’11 feet tall. Heck, he even knows how to use guns, as he was taught to not eat processed food, and just eat non processed food, so he learned how to hunt when he was 6. So out of everyone in my school he definitely knows best on how to use guns. 

The second one was named Morris, he was a percussionist just like me, and he was around the same height as me. We even have the same interests, mashed potatoes and gravy are our favorite foods, water is our favorite drink, and we even have the same birthday. We were pretty much long lost twins at this point.

The third one was named Ricky, he played Tuba, he apparently loved to make things up, saying that the gods sent him so he could play Tuba and constantly spreading fake news across the school, and he even got the nickname “Mr. Bad news Tuba” it became so popular even teachers were calling him it. But outside school he was  actually quite kind, constantly helping people reach things and paying for people’s meals when they didn’t have money. 

I asked them how they got here, and they said that when they were running from the bus they went up north and entered Pennsylvania without knowing it. Fortunately Ricky’s Uncle lived in a nearby town where they were, and he knew how to get out of the woods they were in, so they managed to leave the woods and find his uncle. Fortunately his uncle knew about their story and was able to drive them all the way here, and he was waiting for me to enter the car so we could drive back to school. I was excited, as we had a clear path back home, they said he was waiting for us at the train station, so we set off.

We headed back to the train station, but we all felt hungry. So we found a restaurant and entered it. But the restaurant looked the same as the one we went yesterday. But I figured it was just a coincidence and looked at the menu, but everything said mystery item just like last time. That was enough to scare me, but the others were thinking about what those items could be, and when they turned around, the food was there. So they left some cash and took the bag, and they opened it.

This time it was hamburgers, so they ate it, but they immediately puked. They said the meat tasted “Funky” So they looked at it. They then realized that blood was the sauce, and the lettuce and tomatoes was replaced by a human brain, with a piece of skin being the cheese. It was enough for me to vomit, too. And in our pool of vomit, I found a note. 

“Hamburgers, made out of Aiden and Ernest!”
