I stared down at the bottle.

“How did they get this bottle here?” I thought to myself.

I started sobbing, however, as me and my buddies have pretty much eaten Ethan, the kid who sacrificed himself for me. I looked at my phone, with the time being 9 AM. I called Aiden and Ernest to see what we could do next.

“Sorry, the person you’re dialing is not available” my phone said to me.

“Strange” I thought to myself.

I left them a text asking where they were, before leaving the room to grab a breakfast. But on my doorstep I saw a bag, with a note saying “Free breakfast!”

I figured it was a trap, but I was so hungry I grabbed it and took it inside, then I opened it, a big mistake.

A skull fell out of the bag, with glowing red eyes. I saw another note inside, I read it.

“Tom’s here!” 

I looked back, seeing the skull transform into Tom. I grabbed my things and ran out of the room, locking the door, but I heard my phone ring, I opened the notification, only to see a traumatizing image. Both Aiden and Ernest were bleeding blood from their eyes, with a huge smile. And one of those monsters were standing between them, and in the caption, it said “We got them, now Jonathan, we’re gonna get you too!”

I froze in fear. I was truly alone by myself, fortunately they left some money with me, so maybe I could make it home with the money they left me, so I did the math in the hotel lobby, looking at many charts, maps, and schedules, as well as seeing the price. I managed to find the most optimal path back home, as it barely managed to fit my budget. But when I left the lobby of the hotel I felt a tap on my shoulder, I turned back and saw three people, who recognized me and said their names.

There were three people: Ricky, Sam, and Morris.

I asked them how they got here, and they said that when they were running from the bus they went up north and entered the woods. Fortunately when they were wandering the woods, they met Ricky’s uncle, and he knew how to get out of the woods they were in, so they managed to leave the woods. Fortunately his uncle knew about their story and was able to drive them all the way here, and he was waiting for me to enter the car so we could drive back to school. I was excited, as we had a clear path back home, they said he was waiting for us at the train station, so we set off.

We headed back to the train station, but we all felt hungry. So we found a restaurant and entered it. But the restaurant looked the same as the one we went yesterday. But I figured it was just a coincidence and looked at the menu, but everything said mystery item just like last time. That was enough to scare me, but the others were thinking about what those items could be, and when they turned around, the food was there. So they left some cash and took the bag, and they opened it.

This time it was hamburgers, so they ate it, but they immediately puked. They said the meat tasted “Funky” So they looked at it. They then realized that blood was the sauce, and the lettuce and tomatoes was replaced by a human brain, with a piece of skin being the cheese. It was enough for me to vomit, too. And in our pool of vomit, I found a note. 

“Hamburgers, made out of Aiden and Ernest!”

I threw up again, since they ate two of my friends, too. 

But I knew we needed to move on, however, so we threw that burger in the trash and started walking back to the train station, ready to enter the car and head back.
