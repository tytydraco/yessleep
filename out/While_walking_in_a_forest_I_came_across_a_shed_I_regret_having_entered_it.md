I still can't believe this happened, but I wanted to share my story with the world. It might help me feel better. I had just moved into a new house near a forest, and I had been living there for about a month. I love taking daily walks in the forest, it was so peaceful and relaxing for me. The area wasn't completely isolated, there were other houses nearby and I had made friends with a few of the people who lived there.

One day, while on one of my walks, I stumbled upon an old shed. It was quite rundown and looked like it hadn't been opened in years. My curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to see what was inside, hoping there was something valuable. I opened the door and walked inside, but to my disappointment, there was nothing valuable inside. Just some old tools and a few cobwebs, I was about to leave the shed when I noticed something odd. The door that I had come trough was now gone. In its place was a completely different door. I was so confused and scared, but again, my curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to see what was on the other side.

I stepped trough the door, and what I saw was beyond anything I could have ever imagined. It was like I had entered another dimension. The sky was purple, and the trees were made of some kind of crystal. The ground was covered in some sort of thick fog, and I couldn't see more than a few feet in front of me. I started to feel really scared, like I was in a nightmare. But then I heard something. It was a low growling, coming from the direction I was headed. I knew I had to get out of here as fast as possible, but I had no idea how to get back to where I came from.

I started running, hoping to find my way back, but the growling got louder and closer. Suddenly, I saw a figure emerging from the fog. It was a monster, with red eyes and very sharp claws. I screamed and tried to run, but it was too fast. It caught up to me and grabbed me with its claws. I felt a sharp pain, and then everything went black.

when I woke up, I was back in the original shed, lying on the floor of the shed. I was so relieved to be back, but I was also really scared. I had no idea how I got back, or what that monster was. I went straight to my house and locked the doors. I stayed there for days, too scared to go outside.

I had to share this with the world, because I needed to talk about what happened. I know it sounds crazy, but I swear it's true. I still have scars from the claws. I don't know what that monster was, or where that other place was, but I never want to go back there again. I never walk in the forest anymore, and I've warned my friends to stay away from that old shed.
