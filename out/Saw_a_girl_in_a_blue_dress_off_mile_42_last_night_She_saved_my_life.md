People around here call her The Prom Ghost.

You'll hear about her if you stop long enough at any gas station off Route 19 — always from someone older, someone who swears their cousin’s friend's dad saw her back in the early 2000s. A teenage girl in a light blue prom dress, soaked to the bone, barefoot, standing by the guardrail after midnight.

Some say she's looking for a ride home.
Others say she's looking for him.

I didn't believe a word of it — not until last Thursday.

It was close to 1:00 a.m. when I left a late delivery run. Rain was hammering the windshield, my wipers struggling to keep up. The road out of town was empty, just miles of slick pavement and the rhythmic sound of tires on wet asphalt.

That's when I saw her.

She was standing on the shoulder near mile marker 42, right under a flickering streetlight — long black hair plastered to her face, wearing a light blue dress that shimmered whenever lightning flashed.

At first, I thought she'd been in an accident. I slowed down, rolled the window down just enough to shout.

"Hey! You okay?"

She turned slowly toward me. Her skin was so pale it almost glowed in my headlights, and her eyes — bright, icy blue — locked on mine.

"Can you take me home?" she asked. Her voice was quiet, but somehow I heard it over the rain.

I hesitated. She didn’t look hurt, just cold and lost. Against my better judgment, I unlocked the passenger door.

She slid in without a sound. The seat barely moved under her weight. Her dress was dripping wet, but the water never touched the seat fabric. I noticed that immediately.

"Where do you live?" I asked, trying to sound casual.

She looked straight ahead.
"Just past the bridge. You'll see it."

There isn't a bridge on that road. At least… there hadn"t been for years. The old one was torn down in 2007 after a bad flood.

I figured maybe she meant one of the overpasses near the highway, so I kept driving.

That's when I started to notice the air inside the truck — cold, freezing cold — like someone had turned the AC all the way up. I glanced at the vents. They were off.

Then she whispered, "You should slow down."

The tone in her voice wasn't scared. It was warning.

A second later, my headlights lit up a downed tree sprawled across the road — a second too late. I slammed the brakes, swerved hard, barely missing it. My heart was hammering in my chest.

I turned to thank her.

But she was gone.

The seat was empty, not even damp. Just a faint smell of lilacs in the air — old-fashioned perfume.

I sat there for a long time, rain still pounding against the windshield. Eventually, I turned around and drove back toward town, shaken but alive.

The next day, I stopped by a local diner I usually hit for coffee. I told the waitress what I'd seen — half joking, trying to make sense of it.

Her smile faded.
"You mean Sylvia?"

I blinked. "You know her?"

"Everyone does." she said quietly. "She died back in 2003. On prom night. Her boyfriend lost control of the car on that old bridge during a storm. They say she crawled out and tried to flag someone down before the bridge gave out completely."

I didn't finish my coffee.

Now, every time it rains, I can't help looking at the side of the road as I drive past mile 42.

Sometimes, in the corner of my mirror, I think I see a flicker of blue in the headlights — and I slow down, just in case.

Because if the stories are true, she doesn’t haunt people.

She warns them.

And maybe she's still trying to save the ones she couldn't that night.
