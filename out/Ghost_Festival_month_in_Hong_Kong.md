Attention: this is not a creepypasta or anything made-up. I’m telling it exactly as I experienced it. Maybe I was too impressionable, or maybe I really encountered something otherworldly.

Three years ago, I had a 4-day business trip to Hong Kong. Our entire delegation stayed at the Four Seasons. I absolutely loved the city. Especially since I live in Dubai, I was amazed that the whole city is built on hills. Like an Asian San Francisco. The weather was lovely, the food was fantastic, and the hotel was perfect. Work took up the first two days, and the next two were free. So, I booked a walking tour of Hong Kong to at least get a little familiar with the culture, since it was my first trip to China. We walked around the city with a guide, saw the sights, and the last stop was a Chinese temple and a columbarium. The columbarium looks like a library, with “books” from floor to ceiling, where each “book” is an urn with ashes, labeled with the name, date of birth and death, and a small black-and-white passport photo of the deceased. The urns at eye level are the most expensive; lower or higher ones are for those who couldn’t afford a “proper” burial. For some reason, that room really struck me. I even got goosebumps. We left the columbarium and continued walking to the end point of the tour. That’s when I started noticing small altars on every lamppost or pillar, with flowers, cigarettes, cookies, a little offering set for all occasions. I asked the guide what it was, and she explained that it was currently Ghost Festival Month in Hong Kong, the month of the Hungry Ghost Festival. I don’t remember exactly if the dates change each year, but it’s usually mid-August to mid-September. I was there in early September. In short, during this time, Hong Kongers believe that ghosts walk among the living, so they leave offerings for them. That was the backstory. Now, the actual story:

After the tour, I went to dinner and then returned to the hotel. Despite the time difference being only 4 or 5 hours, I was suffering from brutal jet lag, so every night I slept poorly and woke up at 4 or 5 a.m. That night, I woke up again at 4:30. I woke up, drank some water, checked the time on my phone, and tried to force myself back to sleep. When I sleep, I always cover my head with the blanket. It’s been that way since childhood; it makes me feel more comfortable. So, I’m lying on my back, blanket pulled up to my eyes. The blanket is thick, so all I can see is its edge and the ceiling. I’m lying there, thinking my thoughts, not wanting to sleep at all, and it seems like dawn is already starting to break. At some point, I felt someone sit on the bed. Actual weight. I got so scared that I froze. Unfortunately, my fight-or-flight response is “freeze.” I’m lying there, feeling the weight shift from the edge of the bed toward me. And then I saw a face above the blanket. A Chinese woman, looking at me. At first, she looked middle-aged, with black hair and smooth skin. And right before my eyes, she began to age. Her hair turned white, her face wrinkled. I stared in horror and started praying (I’m not a very religious person at all). A few seconds passed, and everything vanished. I was still lying on my back, staring at an empty ceiling. And the paralysis lifted. I’ve never experienced anything like it before or since in my life.
