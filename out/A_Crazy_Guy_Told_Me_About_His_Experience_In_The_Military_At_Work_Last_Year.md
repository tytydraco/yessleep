I had something odd happen to me about 14 or so months ago, and I’ve been thinking about it over and over again ever since. I figure the beginning of October is as good as any to tell this story, because it’s freaky, and best of all, it’s a real thing that happened to me. It’s a short story, so sorry to those of you who like longer reads. I’m also wondering if anyone else has ever ran into this. So I worked for a major retailer as a floor employee at the time. It’s a home improvement store, I won’t say which one because I’m sure you can already guess. 

I have a lot of interaction with customers because I’m a salesperson on the floor. My job is go around and bother people as they are shopping and try to push some product or service they don’t need and make sure I complete some quota. I talk to a lot of weird people. Everyone who has ever worked in retail and interacted with the public has so I know you all know what I’m talking about. Crazy religious ladies. Weird tweakers. Rude Karens. Old men who get confused about what you just told them. 

I met a guy one day, and he caught my eye because he was wandering around with this look on his face. We were near the front of the store. He was wearing camouflage, was pretty dirty, and his eyes looked wide open. He had this plain look on his face. Not like he was depressed or bored or out of it but just a neutral look. He was wondering aimlessly through the store and he didn’t seem busy so I decided I’d talk to him and see if I couldn’t get a name for my quota. I roll up and I introduce myself to him. 

He looks at me then looks out into space as I’m talking to him. He wasn’t really responding, but I do my usual pitch, and I get to the end and ask him if he’d be interested. I hand him a flier then ask him for his name and number. He takes the flier, still staring off into space, and without looking at me says “You know there are aliens right?”

I get really caught off by this and I respond by saying excuse me. 

“Yeah. Aliens. I was apart of the military. I’m a veteran. I’m homeless right now, but that’s because I wouldn’t do what they said.” 

I stare at him. He glances over at me. 

“They keep telling me not to tell people this. I’ve had military commanders and CIA agents tell me that they’ll lock me up if I keep doing it, but I don’t really care. I’ve seen them with my own eyes. It’s horrible.”

I am at a loss for words, but nod my head awkwardly. 

“Yeah. They control almost everything. I have seen things so terrible you wouldn’t believe me. I know I sound crazy, but it’s true. Our government has known for decades.”

I’m pretty freaked out at this point while he’s talking. You ever get that crawling sort of feeling in the back of your neck? The kinda feeling you get when you find yourself strangely, but deeply afraid? I’ve never felt it before that conversation. He continued. 

“They’ve been working with them. They didn’t have any choice. This way none of us suffers as much. Ignorance is bliss. But we soldiers are sometimes told about it. We have to monitor their ships.” 

I felt like I was gonna throw up. And I don’t know why. I think it’s the way he delivered all of this information to me. He was dead pan. Not an ounce of wavering or any hint he was messing with me. He’s just so upfront about it, and it’s clear he has nothing to lose. He just kept going. 

“Did you know, there’s a machine that can get us to Mars in 6 hours? 6 hours! They have a diplomatic base there. I know you think I’m crazy. I’m not crazy. I’ve never been the same since I saw it. I can’t keep a job. I’m on drugs now because of it. Mostly meth. Was kicked out of the military early because of my big mouth. But I don’t care. I don’t care anymore what happens to me. People need to know.” 

Now there are two distinct possibilities. Either one, based on him telling me he’s on Meth, he’s a homeless veteran dude who happens to be going through an episode of psychosis, or two, he’s telling me the truth. Or at least what he is absolutely certain is the truth. Either way, I have never been more unnerved by a customer interaction in my life. I’ve talked to crazy people before. My mother was an alcoholic and she used to say crazy shit all the time. My aunt is into conspiracy theories and has gone on rants. We have a family friend who is the same way and I’ve heard her rant. This was not crazy. Or if it was, it’s the kind of crazy where the person is dead certain of what they saw. Either this dude is 100% certifiably bat-shit insane, or he’s telling me the truth. There’s no other explanation. 

I tell him thank you for the story and that I’m not sure what I believe, but I hope things go ok for him. 

“It won’t get better for me. They’ll come for me at some point. Oh, well. My wife has left me. My kids think I’m insane. I have nothing left to lose. Everything is fucked.” 

He walks off and goes up to the cashier at the front desk area where they do the returns. He starts telling her the same story. 

I was thoroughly frightened by this guy. I told him the truth. I’m not sure what I believe. I ignored everything and tried to push my fear down and continue with my day. I kept working that day and filed it away under being just another weird interaction I’ve had at work. 

A few months after that interaction, a coworker tells me about how Congress had a public bi-partisan meeting regarding an apparent secret executive branch program that has intelligence and information about extraterrestrials. Apparently this project has been active for decades. I’ve read some of the files alleged by the former government workers who are attesting this, and it’s scary. The program apparently was called “Emaculate Constellation”. Apparently they’ve interacted with and met with several kinds of extraterrestrials. We’ve been monitored by them for years. UFO crashes. “Humanoid Non-Terrestrial Beings” were found. Detailed descriptions and investigations into real actual UAP incidents with the Air Force. Look this stuff up, it’s real. And this story, despite being on this area of this site, I promise you, is real. I really had an interaction with a customer like this. I swear to God. 

I think about some of the experiences I’ve had as a kid. Looking out into the fields in the countryside and seeing odd things floating in the wind. Odd shapes and metallic objects without explanation. One evening getting up and watching a bright blue metallic object fly over my house and disappear over the horizon. I always thought I just had a very active imagination and just saw passenger plane fly low over my house. 

And those videos the Biden administration released? There must be a logical explanation for it. Something we have yet to discover, or maybe enemy aircraft with advanced technology we aren’t aware of. And that guy? Well, I mentioned he was on meth. Dude was probably crazy. I hope.

At least that’s what I like to tell myself anyways.
