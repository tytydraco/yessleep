My mom insisted we spend the holidays at our cabin in the woods. She said it was the perfect place to **"become one with nature."** I never liked it there. The cabin was old and creaky, buried under fresh snow that made everything silent and eerie. But my sister, Tori, didn't mind at all. She'd sit by the fireplace, flipping through Mom's worn-out fairy tales, her eyes shining like she knew a secret.

One evening, as the shadows outside grew long and dark, Tori stared out the window. "Do you think Mom's stories are true?" she whispered, her breath fogging up the glass.

I looked up from my book. **"They're just stories,"** I said, trying to sound confident.

"But what if something's out there?" she asked again, her voice barely audible.

A chill ran down my spine, but I shrugged it off. "You're letting your imagination run wild," I replied, forcing a smile.

That night, Tori begged me to go into the forest with her. "Just for a little while," she pleaded. "I want to see if we can hear anything."

I didn't want to go, but the look in her eyes made it hard to refuse. Reluctantly, I bundled up, and we stepped out into the cold. The snow crunched under our boots as we walked into the trees. The forest was thick and dark, the branches above twisting together like a web. The paths we knew so well seemed different, like the woods had shifted when we weren't looking.

**"See? It's just trees and snow,"** I said, rubbing my arms to keep warm.

Tori didn't answer. She was listening intently, her head tilted to the side. "Wait," she whispered. "Do you hear that?"

I stopped and strained to listen. At first, there was only the sound of the wind sighing through the branches. Then, faintly, a whistle threaded through the air. It was a haunting sound, low and hollow, that sent a shiver through me.

"It's just the wind," I said, but my voice shook.

The whistle came again, clearer this time. It seemed to wrap around us, drawing us deeper into the woods.

Before I could stop her, Tori stepped forward. "Maybe it's someone who needs help," she said, her eyes wide.

"Wait!" I reached out to grab her, but she moved too quickly, slipping between the trees.

Panic gripped me as she disappeared from sight. "Tori!" I shouted, my voice echoing. The only answer was the whistle, now sounding like a mocking tune.

I stumbled after her, the shadows pressing in. The trees seemed to close around me, their branches scratching at my clothes. My heart pounded in my chest.

**Then I saw it.**

In a clearing bathed in cold moonlight stood a towering figure. It was like nothing I'd ever seen. Its body was thin and stretched, limbs bending at unnatural angles. Huge antlers twisted from its head, seeming to swallow the light and cloak it in darkness. Its eyes were empty holes, and from its jagged mouth came the haunting whistle.

I stood frozen as it turned toward me. "Brooke..." it whispered, my name distorted and echoing in the stillness.

Fear rooted me to the spot. My mind screamed at me to run, but my legs wouldn't move. The creature took a step closer, its movements smooth and eerie.

Somehow, I found the strength to turn and run. Branches tore at my clothes and scratched my face as I fled. The whistle chased me, wrapping around me like a cold wind.

I burst into the cabin, slamming the door behind me. "Mom!" I cried out, gasping for breath. The house was dark and silent.

"We have to... we need to... it's out there—" I stammered, tears blurring my vision.

A soft sound came from the back porch. Heart pounding, I crept toward it. Through the window, I saw her standing there, her back to me. Her body shook slightly, shadows swirling around her feet.

**"Mom?"** I whispered, my voice barely audible.

She turned slowly. Her eyes met mine, but they weren't the warm eyes I knew. They were hollow and empty, just like the creature's. A chilling smile spread across her face. **"You're home, dear,"** she said, her voice layered with that haunting whistle. **"We've been waiting for you."**

Behind her, Tori stepped into view. She moved stiffly, like a puppet on strings. Her eyes were vacant, and as she opened her mouth, the whistle filled the room, echoing off the walls.

I stumbled back, my stomach twisting with fear. The cabin seemed to close in on me, the shadows stretching into monstrous shapes. It hit me all at once—the creature wasn't just in the woods. It was here, inside my home, wearing the faces of my family.
