I work for NASA or at least used to.

We were making a satellite to explore the newly discovered ‘Floyd space hole’. A place in space where no stars seem to exist. Our team was very small due to the seemingly pointless nature of our mission; James, Mac, Joseph and I. We oversaw the launch. It went off without a hitch. As the satellite flew through space, some of our team went off to other projects for the time being. Joseph was smart, even for NASA standards. The Hubble telescope was his next job. Joseph led their team to find out what types of galaxies and cosmic dust clouds and what names to call them. Making sure that the satellite didn’t swerve off course or crash into drifting asteroid belts, Mac and James stayed on the team.  I took a well deserved break to visit family down south.

About three months later, Mac called Joseph and I back  to our long deserted posts on our team. Apparently the satellite found a solitary star within the hole and was currently joining the star's orbit  to take a closer look. We joined up in our small board room to look at live photos taken from the satellite. 

“Who is ready to make history,” Mac rubbed his hands together. 

“Not much history, it’s just a star”

“Come on, joey, don’t be a party pooper.”

James and I were just waiting for the pictures. Seems like all of us but Mac has lost interest in the project. He was always the excited one, believing in aliens and their possible intelligence and technology. Mac picked up the remote with giddy excitement and pressed the connect button. The TV switched from a blank, black screen to a partly clear image of a bright red planet with orange stripes sitting in a blank void. The planet was half lit by its parent star. The remote clicked again to show a similar image of the red planet with its stripes slightly altered as the planet spun. The next images left the room in a stunned silence. A dark blue, ringed planet came into frame, this one was much smaller than the red planet, seemingly in a collision course with the previous planet. Mac clicked the remote again after about ten seconds of odd confusion. This one showed the red plant dented and spilling magma like an open wound. The ringed planet had turned into a line of space rocks. 

I started to make explanations for the planet ending even "It's not abnormal for planets to crash into each other”

“Yes but we took some pictures before the satellite started entering orbit and it showed the planets approximately a few million miles away. Planet can move that far in ten days.'' James stopped my answer in its tracks.

“Rotate  the camera.”

Mac moved to a high powered computer hidden within a briefcase and moved a joy stick to the left. He clicked the remote again. This is what haunts me. There was a purple tentacle wrapped  around a large grey planet. A next image popped onto the screen showing the tentacle outstretched. letting the planet fly at another small Venus- like planet. Joseph clasped his hand over his mouth, Mac sat in pure confusion and terror, eyes sunk back in his head  as James and I found bins to unload our bowls. It was throwing planets like marbles, toys that could be replaced. No wonder there were no stars in the surrounding area. 

“What the ,uuggghhh,” I asked, badly timed with my vomiting.

“TURN IT OFF, PLEASE!”

With a click the godly hand turned to black. For the next half hour, all we did was vomit, quietly sob or ask what the hell was that. We weren’t powerful. We weren't special. We felt the full message punching us in the gut. After we gathered ourselves, we told our superiors and after some convincing ,the government rolled in. The mission was put under wraps. We were sworn to secrecy by threats and legal documents. 

It’s been a year. I don’t know exactly what else happened to the team. I think James went underground, Joseph was admitted to a mental home and Mac, I don't know what happened to him. He could’ve ended for all I know. I thought I would get this to the masses before I found out what to do with myself. 

If you are looking to be an astronomer, don’t look for the Floyd space hole. There will be a lot more than the government to worry about.
