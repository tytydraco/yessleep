Hello again all. I would like to vent more about my experience at Happy Harbor if you have the time to read I’m in a bit of a crisis and would like some more insight.

So, I’ve been working here for a couple days now, I forgot to mention in my last post that my aunt's shop is called Harbor Treasures. In the 3 days I’ve been here I’ve only had a few customers, can’t say I’m surprised as we’re moving into the off season and it’s really cloudy up here. I’ve caught a couple tourists that complained about the state of the bathroom, my fault. I’ve seen a few kids from the town that pick up things from the shop Snack bar, my aunt sells those little Halloween candy bits for a dollar a scoop, along with Kaprisuns with every candy purchase. 

Other than that though it’s been a lot of sitting and looking out the window, face to face with the grey beach and dark ocean. You see weird things on the beach when nothing's going on, especially on rainy days. Sometimes it’s the local kids throwing wet sand at each other and swimming in the ice cold ocean they’ve grown up next to. And sometimes it’s a bloated fish carcass that some men in a fucking car dump into a trunk and drive off with. I try not to stare at those types of encounters.

The most common sight however is the weird fisherman with the plastic shovel hand. He walks the beaches every day, digs a hole in the same spot, looks at my shop with his piercing yellow eyes, bites the head of a fish and moves on, like clockwork, almost as if he’s trying to tell me something, but my Aunt tells me he’s just some crackhead, seemingly the only one in town.

Speaking of, I haven't seen my Uncle since our introduction. Thankfully, my Aunt tells me he’s giving me time and that he apologizes, but I can only hope he gives me as much time as possible. I asked my Aunt about how they met and she once again got very cagey.

“Leonard? What’s it matter to you?”

“I-I dunno Aunt Lana I was just curious”

“Well you know what they say about curiosity and cats sweetie hehe.”

She then shut down the conversation and asked why I insisted on painting my nails so. I’m just not gonna push the subject I think. 

I met my Cousin Xander again, last time I met him he was a tyke, I was 6 and he was 4 and he was about the size of my length to my hip, he was a bit of a pushover that barked loud, always getting into fights with the kids that worked on the fishing docs with their family. I used to have to get him out of the fights he’d start by threatening to “cast spells on them” because they used to think I looked like a witch, just stupid kid shit. But he was now a 20 year old dude, our height roles have been completely reversed. He must be 6 '4, meanwhile I stopped growing at 5' 3, inheriting my moms height. Xander looks like 200 pounds of pure muscle, I remember my Uncle Danny being a strong guy but neither my Aunt or former Uncle were anywhere near as huge as he wound up… maybe my Aunt was sleeping around.

When I first saw him again he stumbled into the shop slamming his head on the wood above the door, he was dressed in a yellow Denim Jacket that read Harborside, he had bloody knuckles that were wrapped in bandages, he had a gold chain coming out of his left jacket pocket. He has a very baby face, and is blessed to not need to deal with facial hair, his hair is buzzed brown, and his eyes are a striking blue, he reads as a very tough manly man generally. He came into the shop while I was working, very excited, reaching over my counter and picking me up in an unwelcomed, but not unappreciated I guess hug.

“Dude Tanner! How longs it been!”

I tried to respond but his hug was extremely tight, and I am an extremely small person. 

“Oh sorry!”

He set me down like I weighed nothing, and I won’t lie I was thoroughly intimidated by this man I used to tower over.

“You're ok. 16 years I think, it’s good to see you, you look great!”

I remember him grinning in pride at that compliment, as if it meant more coming from me. 

“Well y’know, couldn’t keep scrawny without you around to scare the Docksiders off me.”

“Docksiders?”

My cousins proceeded to lore dump on the wack ass 80s gang warfare that was going on in this weird ass town. So to summarize. Dockside is the big ass fishing harbor on the eastern side of town, apparently since the 90s they’ve been trying to expand into the tourism district of Happy Harbor claiming their fishing industry meant a lot more to the town than the tourism industry, and Harborside is the west side of the town where the festivals happen, and the various beachside tourist trap building sit, like my Aunts shop. Harborside has been fighting against Docksiders advances into the Western side of town for years, bit by bit. Mostly because a good amount of Docksiders are in the small government of the town hall. And sometime in the early 2000s teens wanting to keep their summer tourism jobs began vandalizing and generally ruining Harborside fishing gear, boats, and general packing plants. This slowed down Dockside industry so much that teenagers from the Dockside began fighting back against the Harborside vandals, and since 2004 or so it’s been gang scuffles in the area as each gang demands allegiance from the local businesses on threat of general vandalism. It’s not like these gang fights ever end in death, usually, it’s mostly fisticuffs, scuffles and general vandalism on both sides.

This all came as a campy surprise to me, but it turns out Xander is the Eldest member of the Harborside Gang, mostly because unlike most members of the gang, he refuses to grow out of the general ruffian behavior, he’s kinda like a super senior for this gang of High School Kids, his age apparently commands a lot of respect for the gang though, as a couple more Harborsiders came into the shop to meet me, I couldn’t tell you the tubby ones name, but the skinnier younger kid looked jittery, his names Little Nick. While we were talking Uncle Leonard came up And that name brought a shiver to Little Nick's spine as it did mine which had us catching each others gaze for a second. Xander had a lot to say about his stepdad though.

“The fat Docksider is an alcoholic who’s sweating constantly. The only reason he married my mom is cus he was fired from a Dockside fishing plant. He refuses to spend money renovating the old shop, his previous kids hate his guts, he smells like death constantly! Just  a stupid balding wart of a human!”

…and he looks like a fish. Why didn’t he mention the obvious rotting fish appearance, the bubbly voice! I was so confused I had to say something.

“A-and he looks really weird right?”

I saw Little Nicky perk up as I said that but Xander and the tubby subordinate just stared at me confused. Xander spoke up.

“Wha-I mean like, sure. He’s a fugly looking dude.”

“W-with like a fish face?”

I watched Xander laugh along with his other subordinate at the suggestion of him having a fish-like appearance, but Little Nicky just stared at me as his breath got shallow, Little Nicky had the Harborside jacket, but he was clearly too small for it, his hair was red with curls, he had mocha skin, and his eyes were Grey like mine. He must’ve been 12 though ironically “Little Nicky” was about my height. He was thin and had bags under his eyes, his stare was as if he found another person in the middle of a desert and it unsettled me, but Xander continued.

“Yeah Well he certainly smells like it! I don’t know how, makes me think the guy’s a dockside spy or something cus he ”allegedly” hasn’t stepped foot in a fish plant for years.”

Probably because he’s a fucking fish! I decided to drop the topic, I didn’t feel like it was going anywhere. We talked more about general life, where I had to explain gender fluidity to all of the 3 boys from this town locked in time, but they seemed accepting of it which was cool. We all stayed and talked for hours before I had to start closing up shop. We said goodbye for now and Xander invited me to the Harbor, an amusement park on the old Dock on Harborside, he offered to get me in for free because he knew the owner and I didn’t have a reason to say no so I accepted and we parted. I closed up the building, cleaned the bathroom, and went back up to the loft where I started writing this up, but then I heard a tapping on the Loft window and nearly died of a heart attack as I saw Little Nicky’s face peering from the window, I fell off my bed and tried to get him to move off the roof, I don’t have the ability to open the Loft window.

We met in the main shop area where he pulled out a pencil and notepad, turns out Little Nicky is mute, he won’t go into why but I also haven’t asked, he wrote out.

“You see the fish people?”

I blinked a couple times reading the note. 

“Fish People?” 

“Your Uncle, Xanders Stepdad, he’s a fish right?”

I nodded as I shuddered at the implication of more fish people. Nicky continued writing.

“More fish people. I’ve seen them, since I can remember, people think I’m crazy. You don’t think I’m crazy, you see fish people.”

I won’t lie for a second. I began to consider that me and Nicky might be crazy, and I think he could tell from my facial expression, because he kept writing.

“Everyone else, broken eyes, can’t explain, many people can’t see. I’ve always seen it. Monsters are real, your eyes, not broken.”

I couldn’t help but notice his shaky writing and broken English even in his sentences. He began crying almost in relief as he went to hug me, I couldn’t help but feel a light connection to this kid. He was clearly scared and relieved, he hugged me for a minute before I spoke.

”Ok, calm down, yeah I see it. I’ve only seen the one but you're telling me there’s more?“

He pulled from me and nodded fiddling with his notepad to keep writing, but as he finished writing “more” a gross bubbly voice screeched through the evening.

“Nicholas! Curfew is 8 you brat! Get out here! If I have to find you it’s not gonna be pretty!” 

Nicky looked at me with panic in his eyes, his breath went shallow and he teared up, an experience I recognized all too well, I led him up to the Loft and told him to hide under the bed, but as I hid him up there I saw from my Loft Window a group of large people in heavy rain coats looked up at me with deep aquamarine eyes that almost glowed in the dark. I felt my own breath hitch as I ran down to the shop to lock it. I locked it right on time as a man towered over the glass door, covering all light that was left from entering through the glass door. His features were mostly obscured by the hood of his raincoat and the darkness of late Dusk, but his bright eyes pierced my soul as a bubbly voice emerged from the form.

“Your Lana’s new pet huh?”

“Pet?” I thought to myself, but decided to think about it more later.

“I-I work here yeah… hey man sorry we’re closed so I can’t-!”

He cut me off with a gargle of a yell.

“Cut the Shit Harborsider! Open up the shop, a rat snuck in your walls, one that belongs to us.”

Panic washed over me as I began crying, my breathing quickened, my fingers nearly broke as I clutched to the wooden shop floor for dear life. I had no idea what to do, but I knew I wasn’t gonna open this door, no matter what. I’d like to tell you I was heroically shielding Nicky, but I genuinely thought I was gonna die if I let this monster in.

“G-Get the f-fuck out of h-here m-man (sniff) I-ill call the c-cops”

He chuckled at that response. And my heart beat quickened.

“If you think cops are gonna save you, you clearly haven’t been here long enough…”

I went pale as three other of these men came up behind the main one.

“Last call Harborsider, open the door and you get to live another day.” 

My blood turned to ice, as my heart stopped. I sat on the floor, tears flowing freely, I've been given death threats plenty of times online, from people you can’t see, people who can only represent themselves with words, but being told you're gonna die in person, by something you know you can’t defend against… it’s a feeling I’m never gonna forget… my eyes went cloudy as I threw up on the floor. The creatures laughed at my distress as they ripped the doorknob off the shop door and began cracking the glass with ease, my mind was a haze and I couldn’t even react, I was going to die. I was going to die in this stupid attempt to fix my fucked up life, I thought about my dad, losing his last surviving family member, I thought about my mom and sister who lost their lives but 16 years before, almost exactly. Everything began to feel so poetic. I felt at ease, almost accepting, like everything that was about to happen was out of my hands. 

I was ripped to consciousness by a loud pop! It sounded like a firecracker hitting the ground, but like ten times as loud, I saw in a glimpse the large monster over the doors head being blown in half from the right side, his catfish like eyes, and tendril esc whiskers in full view, his gaping maw was wide, and green and blue gore spewed from the skull of the monster, it fell backwards and hit the ground with a loud thud. The two other monsters hissed and sprinted off as two more pops went off, missing the creatures but undeniably scaring the shit out of them. I saw the man with the gun make an appearance, it was the old fisherman I'd seen on the beach, with the plastic shovel hand. He looked at me with his bright yellow eyes and chuckled.

“Ya lose yer chum there?”

I was in a state I can only assume was shock, I acknowledged his words in my brain but I didn’t speak, id seen my mom die, it was the last time I’d ever seen her, but I was so young, I didn’t know how to begin processing it, this was different, I began to cry more.

“Ey, Ey, Ey. I need ya to breathe ok? Everythins gonna be alright ok?”

His words pulled me out of my state enough to nod at him.

“Ok, when ya find yer bearings, I need ya to help me drag this bloke to the beach ok? I’ll take care of it from there.”

I stared at him in shock only for him to chime in.

“I’m 70 lad, err lass? This ere weighs at least 150 kilos, it’ll be better fer everyone if we can get this lad to the beach”

I nearly threw up as I got to my feet. I wanted more than anything to run back to my bed and cry myself to sleep, but I'd be hard pressed to argue with a man with a revolver. 

“O-ok”

“Righto hehehe”

I helped this stranger net this creature and drag it to the beach after 10 or so minutes. I watched the old man pull a rusty knife out and gut the things stomach with a loud rip, I nearly hurled as whole raw fish spilled out of its severed belly. He picked one up and but it’s head off, chewed and swallowed before looking at me.

“They fish in the belly of beasts taste the sweetest… now go on back… figure out what you're gonna do with the lad, yer lucky I was around this time.” I’ll clean the blood, it tends to look odd to people with broken eyes…”

I just nodded as I walked back to the shop, but I heard the man shout behind me.

“Welcome to Happy Harbor Tanner. I hope ya enjoy yer stay!”

I swallowed and nodded as I rushed back to the shop, Nicky was looking through the loft window, he looked relieved as he saw me come back. I made it back to the loft only to see Nicky with his notepad, the word “Sorry” written on the notepad. I nodded and began panicking a bit more but swallowed hard and replied.

“I-It’s ok. You can stay the night ok.”

He enthusiastically nodded, call me crazy after that incident… but I’ve been as scared as that boy was before. And if it were me in that situation, I'd hope someone would have the ability to make everything ok, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to try and do that for this kid. I took my blanket and one of my pillows And set up a little Nook for him and finished writing this post.

So… I don’t know what to do… and need advice if any of you have it. I appreciate any response. And hope you all have a peaceful night, week, and hell. Life… goodnight all.
