I was eighteen when he came to me in the dead of night, scritch-scratching on the windowpane of my bedroom on the second floor of our house on York Street. We made a deal, and now I had to settle up.

When I'd met him the day before and traded him my soul for a favor, I thought that ended it. But there's no even-Stephen or all-square, not with him.

\*\*\*

It was 1986, and I'd been out hunting with Eddie Jobin. Eddie was driving deer toward me, down off Morrison Hill, which is where the big bruisers holed up in the dense poplar growth when they took a break from chasing does during the rut when the moon was full.

Eddie had flushed a monster - two sixty if he was a pound, at least that's how I remember it. But memory is a funny thing that way, isn't it?

You think things are bigger than they were, and when you revisit them, with the benefit of years, they seem impossibly smaller. The acres of your front yard were nothing but a twelve-foot patch of crabgrass from the curb to the porch.

I had seen the big bastard coming and lifted my father's old .30-06 to my shoulder and fired, and it struck flesh, but it wasn't the twelve-pointer.

The bullet sliced through Eddie's neck, and he coughed, choked, and wheezed as his blood spilled out onto the dying foliage beneath his body.

I had seen the buck in my scope. I was sure of it. But when I lowered my rifle, he was gone. I wrestle with that all these years later. What I can tell you for certain is this – I saw it.

I ambled toward Eddie, too shocked to cry out. Blood gurgled in his throat as he coughed out his last breaths.

"It's okay," a voice said, and at first, I thought it was Eddie. But the voice was placid, with a distance that sounded like it was talking to me through a thin wall, a couple of prisoners whispering so the guards couldn't hear.

I turned to find who or what the voice had come from, and it was a man seated on a log. His hair was white and slicked back with something as oily as the smile on his lips. He wasn't old because there were no wrinkles on his skin.

It was as if a surgical glove had been stretched over his head and vacuum sealed. The corners of his mouth appeared like invisible fingers were pulling them back into a slight grin. He wore a white apron over a flannel shirt and drab pants, and the apron was covered with blood splatters.

I asked him who he was, and he said, "You’re a friend, so you can call me Ulric.I'm from 'round here and make my living from what the woods provides, just as your daddy and his daddy and his daddy did, and just like you will. But that work is paper and mine is flesh."

He took a piece of leather from the apron's pocket and unfolded it. On it sat a plethora of sharp, rusted, and medieval-looking tools. I tensed, but I didn't want to step back and betray my fear.

Instead, I looked at Eddie, who had ceased moving, though I could still faintly hear that gurgling sound.

"I'm a taxidermist, and I cut 'em for a double sawbuck, a good old Andrew Jackson that's right, but that ain't the real price, no, no, no, no-siree, the price I charge…" he trailed off, then, lowering his voice conspiratorially, "what I charge it's not in money, you understand my meaning, dontcha, boy?"

I nodded slowly even though I didn't really understand. I licked my lips, but there wasn't a drop of saliva in my mouth to moisten them.

I thought of the consequences of admitting to what I’d done. It was an accident. You couldn’t get in trouble for an accident, could you? But what if…no one believed me?

Ulric took two short knives with hooked ends and scraped them together, creating a piercing, high- pitched sound. His eyes were a milky blue as if clouded by cataracts.

He rocketed violently up off the log to his feet, then was in front of me, sticking the tip of one of the knives into the blaze orange of my hunting vest.

"Now I'll take care of this for you, and the terms will be fair, I'm a square-dealer, understand?" he said and his tone was almost deferential.

I didn't respond because I wasn't exactly sure what our agreement would be.

"Call it a deal, bucko?" and now he wasn't so deferential. There were clouds in his eyes and they swirled like the animation of a winter storm on the six o'clock news.

Even though I was unsure I nodded, then he reached into the pocket of his apron and pulled out a pair of rusty crucible tongs and lifted them toward my nose, and I did my best not to flinch.

They poked into one of my nostrils and I wasn't sure they would fit, but Ulric didn't seem to have a problem stuffing them up there. It took some probing, but he started to pull at something, and out it came.

Pinched between the end of the tongs was a carrion beetle, the kind of bug that feeds on the flesh of the dead. He took it between his gnarled fingers, popped it into his mouth, and chewed.

"Oooh, that's a smoky one, coal-fired, oh you bet," he said.

I could taste it in my mouth too, and it was like eating sulfur. His yellowed teeth chomped and crunched the thorax.

Ulric walked over to the body and knelt, lowering his mouth until it was close to Eddie's. He parted his lips and the beetle crawled from between them and into Eddie's mouth.

Eddie's skin began to rise and fall, undulating as if something were alive inside of him, an infinite number of ripples across a pond. Beetles, hundreds, thousands, began to devour him from inside out, poking their heads out of his skin, and soon there was nothing left.

His body was gone. The only thing that remained was the mushroomed round I'd fired into him. I swung my head around and Ulric was gone too.

So I scooped up what remained of that bullet, then backtracked to find my shell casing. Then I went home, and when I got there, I went to my room, fell facedown into the pillow, and cried for Eddie and what I'd done.

\*\*\*

Eddie would often hunt by himself, and it was just as likely that he'd been out there alone as it was that he was hunting with me.

And wouldn't it be like some Masshole up here looking to get a real deer and not one of those jackrabbit-sized bucks they have down south to shoot a local and leave him for dead?

When the tears were spent, I went to Eddie's house with the rifle slung over my shoulder. I knocked on the front door, and Mr. Jobin answered.

I asked if Eddie was home and if he might like to go out looking for a deer before dark came, and Mr. Jobin said he'd already trudged out with his .22 shortly before legal shooting hours that morning.

He hadn't seen hide nor hair of him since, and maybe he'd managed to get himself a buck and was having trouble dragging it out on his own. I thanked him and went home.

It had only been an accident at first, but now, my wicked deeds were piling up.

At supper, my father's beef stew didn't go down easy. He was home for dinner because the mill was on strike that fall. My mother had taken the cancer and died fifteen months ago.

Taken it. That's what my grandmother used to say before it took her. As if it were a conscious choice, like plucking something off the shelf at Martin's Hardware.

At the table, my father looked at me with a suspicious curiosity. I thought he could smell it on me, just like I could smell the beer on him. I excused myself and went back to my room.

I crawled into bed, stared out the window across the river, and saw the stacks of the paper mill belching their relentless plumes that smelled of sulfur, the tallest of them with a blinking red cyclops eye, shrouded in smoke from the shorter ones.

The union workers weren’t there, but management had found people that were willing to cross the line and keep the lights on and the machines running and the money coming in.

I heard the hollow, rapid thumps of logs falling off a conveyor into an empty metal hopper without a discernible pattern, a pounding irregular heartbeat. And when the ten o'clock whistle blew at the fire station, I was still awake. It sounded like the bleat of a foghorn from a ship in dense fog.

My great-grandfather had come over before the Great War, as the old folks called it, and at first, had worked the log runs when the town was something out of the Old West. Gunfights and saloons, stabbings, brothels on every corner. When the paper mill grew, more immigrants came. Acadians from Canada, the Lithuanians, the Irish, and the Italians.

When he got home from the Pacific with a mangled leg and a 50% disability, my grandfather got a job on the number ten paper machine. When my father got back from the Ia Drang in '66, with no external wounds but plenty on the inside, he went in the mill too.

I had a legacy, and it was twelve bucks an hour, time-and-a-half on weekends.

\*\*\*

The *scritch scratch scritch scratch* at the window in the middle of the night woke me, the hooked end of the knife moving across the pane, beckoned me in blackness.

"Are you gonna play keepsies, boy? Or will you *passiton*?" he asked, the words merging together.

*Passiton.*

*Pass it on.*

I understood what the bargain was now. Would I keep the evil he'd given me? Or would I *passiton?*

Because that's how it works. Evil deeds beget evil deeds, and so on, and so forth, up and down, and back and forth through the ages. We swallow it and let it consume us. Or we *passiton.*

As I pressed the pillow over my ears to drown out his voice and the gurgling sound that never seemed to abate, I thought back to a Bible verse I remembered from Catholic grammar school about Jesus being tempted by the devil.

It was from Matthew. I knew that only because that was my name.

I wasn't being tempted. I had already given in. Still, I mouthed the words silently to myself:

*Away from me, Satan.*

\*\*\*

When Eddie hadn't returned that night, Mr. Jobin called the sheriff, and in the morning, the game wardens brought a dog in, and a search party formed up. Since the mill was on strike, there were plenty of bodies available to scour the woods.

I joined in to keep up appearances, even though I knew they'd never find him. This went on for days and then a week, the missing posters yellowing on telephone poles. Eventually, people lost interest. Kids just disappeared back then and we waited for their picture to show up on a milk carton.

At school, people mostly stopped talking about him. The general consensus was that he'd been taken by the Man In The Blue Van. You know what I'm talking about if you spent more than five minutes in the 80's.

There was that sound at my window each night, that voice hissing at me. "What'll it be, boy? Are you gonna keep it all for yourself like a fat little piggy? Or are you going to send it along?"

I started to see Eddie standing in the corner of my room in the dark. There was the hole in his neck, but inside there was no blood, only the hot, fiery glow of burning wood. It burned so hot that it glowed and crackled, producing that gurgling sound as it turned itself to dust.

*And to dust you shall return.*

A week after it happened, I was in gym class and my stomach churned and growled. I jumped out of the line to climb the rope up to the ceiling and sprinted for the bathroom.

I sat in the stall when I felt my guts shift and twist. Then, they exploded. I looked down and saw thousands of the beetles filling the bowl. I stumbled back out of the stall with my shorts around my ankles, and somehow and managed to kick the flusher with my foot.

The week before Thanksgiving, I started to grow weaker. I couldn't get out of bed and didn’t go to school. I hoped it was just crushing guilt, but deep down, I knew better.

There were headaches, and Eddie standing in the corner, and the scritch scratch at the window and the gurgling that was really burning grew louder and louder.

My father didn't notice what was happening to me because he spent most days on the picket line at the lower gate of the mill and his nights on a barstool at The Silvertone, which he and his buddies had unofficially dubbed "Strike Headquarters." Wink wink.

The night the vomiting started, I mustered as much strength as possible to get downstairs and try to eat something because there was nothing left in my stomach. Maybe we had some Saltines to settle things down.

I was maneuvering around the kitchen table when I saw yesterday's Buckton Falls Times and a headline caught my eye.

*KKK PLANS RALLY*

Rumors about this had been around since the late summer. My buddy Jesse – the only black kid in our grade – had nervously joked that he better lay low for a while, but I don't think he was really joking.

I choked down a couple of crackers and crawled back into bed. I laid there and my eyes fell on the spine of my dog eared copy of Elie Weisel's Night.

I wasn't good in school, but I'd always liked to read. Back in eighth grade, in Sister Rose's class, that one had stuck with me.

The possibility that such evil could exist had gotten deep inside me. It had changed me in the same way that whatever was inside me now had.

But looking at the book gave me an idea - what if there was evil in the world, evil that needed to be extinguished before it could spread?

I didn't think there were Nazis hiding in the trees, but we had the next best thing coming to town.

For the first time since I squeezed the trigger, I felt a jolt of something. Hope, or maybe it was inspiration, or maybe just desperation.

I went downstairs and pulled on my parka and boots. I grabbed a flashlight and shuffled into the woods behind the house, up toward Morrison Hill, only stopping to vomit along the trail.

He was waiting for me in the clearing, his apron fresh with blood.

"That's the look of a passer if I ever saw one, and I've seen my share, more often than not, that's the choice. But I didn't have you made for a passer, no-siree, no, no, no, I sure didn't. Thought you were like your mother, I sure did, you bet," and he cackled that cackle.

*My mother.*

He saw the look on my face and smiled, revealing those yellowed teeth. "You remember Charlie Ginoux, don't ya?" he asked with a knowing grin.

Of course, I did. He was a local guy who shuffled around town with a cane. Kids would whisper that his limp was because he'd been taken prisoner in Korea and the Chinese had sliced his Achilles.

My father assured me that the closest Charlie Ginoux had ever been to China was face down in a pupu platter from the Golden Dragon, #15, substitute fingers for wings, if you please.

Charlie was always out walking, night and day, rain or snow. He didn’t drive, which was probably a good thing for all concerned. It must have been eighteen months now since he'd been struck by a car out on Route 2 late one night and left for dead.

Eighteen months. Right around the time my mother got sick.

"Your father never told you, did he? He probably figured you couldn't handle the truth that your mother liked the bottle more than she liked just about anything else, including you. She liked that drink even more than she like strange men inside of her, you bet," he said, taking great pleasure in all of this.

"She thought it might be a good idea to go speeding through those notches up past the falls. Maybe she was just headed out to get her pussy filled up by Jake McDonald, or a little sucky sucky action. She liked all that on the side, she sure did, but she left Charlie Ginoux dying in a ditch, like a dog –"

"Fuck you!" I shrieked, cutting him off, "That's fucking bullshit!"

He stuck the hooked end of his knife between his front teeth as if trying to dislodge a piece of meat.

"Why didn't she bother to have the treatments if she had cancer? Why did she lock herself up in the attic and wither into nothing, turning away all visitors?" he asked in a sing-song voice.

"Why did you never go up there, but that one time?" he asked, his voice lowering.

I didn't want to believe any of this, but I knew it was true. He was a Master of Lies, but maybe they aren't lies. Maybe they are the things we can't face.

He saw that I was starting to accept the truth and nodded approvingly.

"Your daddy begged her to pass it. He threw himself on the floor and begged her. He even begged for her to pass it to him. But she wouldn't. She was strong…and you?"

I swallowed, mustering my courage. Though it wasn't courage, was it? It was merely girding myself to face my own cowardice for what I was about to do.

"I want to pass it on," I said.

After telling him I wanted to pass it, I felt better. My stomach stopped roiling.

"You got until the next full moon to bring me two," Ulric had said as left me alone in the woods.

"Two!?" I shouted as he slipped from the clearing, headed toward the thick underbrush.

He stopped and turned, looking back at me, eyes flashing.

"Oh you didn't think it was a one-for-one deal, did ya? It's the terms and conditions that get you, it's best if you learn that when you're young. The fine print. I don't do this on the arm, no-sir, no one-for-one- straight up, I sure don't. Charity is for the Little Sisters Of The Poor, I'm a businessman so it's a two-for-one kinda deal."

Then, he was gone.

\*\*\*

At home I looked at myself in the mirror and my color was better. I didn't feel the need to puke. But now I had other problems.

I needed to find two people that deserved to die. Two people that I deemed – as the newly appointed moral arbiter of all things – *had it coming.*

One of them wasn't going to be a problem. The headline that sparked my realization had given me that answer – the Klan was coming to town.

But I had until next Saturday for that one, which happened to be the night of the next full moon, which was my hard deadline for *passsingiton.*

So in the intervening days I needed a plan. But first, I needed someone as deserving as the Grand Dragon of the KKK. Since I didn't have any Nazis or Klansman handy at the moment, I went down the mental list of People Who Have It Coming.

There were murderers of course. But people we know are murderers are generally inhabitants of the state prison down in Thomaston.

This was in the days before online registries so I didn't have a handy list of sex offenders either.

I started going through people individually – people with reputations for dirtbaggery around town, even if it was only rumors. But bar fights and stealing out of the collection plate at Mass didn't exactly rise to the level of deserving to die.

There was Jake McDonald – the man Ulric had accused my mother of sleeping with. I didn’t know much about him other than that he was a loud mouth who stood behind the bench at football games and drunkenly yelled at teenagers for not performing better.

But did he deserve to die just because he was a loud drunk who had an affair? Probably not. It takes two to tango, after all.

I was getting to the bottom of the barrel when I saw Jesse coming up the front walk.

As soon as I saw him I had the answer.

\*\*\*

I didn't know Sgt. Paul Daley, but I knew his son, Tim. He was a couple years ahead of me in school. We'd played football together until he got kicked off the team.

I assumed the apple didn't fall far from the tree. And based off of what Jesse had told me, that was the case.

Two summers ago, Jesse and his father had been coming home from Old Orchard Beach shortly after dark. Daley had pulled them over on the old Milltown Road.

Mr. Cross asked why he'd been pulled over and Daley said he had a taillight out. Mr. Cross knew that was bullshit since he'd just had the car inspected two days prior.

Daley had told him to step out of the vehicle and Mr. Cross told Jesse to stay inside the car and not move a muscle.

Daley walked around to the back of the car with Mr. Cross and they began to argue.

Then, as Jesse looked into the rearview mirror he heard the crack of the gun and saw the muzzle flash in the darkness. His father died before the ambulance could get there.

*He made a move for my gun,* was all that Daley had to say.

That shit flies today, how hard do you think they investigated it in 1986? A black man being shot by a cop? It was a rubber stamp and Daley was back on duty in a couple weeks.

So now Jesse lived with his grandmother and he was knocking at the door asking if I wanted to come over and play the Nintendo she had just got him for his birthday.

I lied and told him I wasn't feeling good but that we'd play that thing until our fingers fell off during Thanksgiving break.

After he left, I knew I had to get Sgt. Paul Daley into the woods so I could pass it on.

\*\*\*

The next morning I called the police department from the pay phone on Middle Ave. I asked for Sgt. Daley. The dispatcher put me through to him

"Hello?" he said, and then I hesitated but finally spoke:

"I have some information on the disappearance of Eddie Jobin," I said, trying to make my voice sound deeper than it was.

There was a rustle of papers, like he was searching for a place to write down what I was saying.

"Ok, ok. Well why don't you tell me about that?" he said.

"I can show you where," I said.

There was a pause, and I could sense his bullshit detector was going off.

"Where - what happened – hold on – first you need to tell me what your name is."

"I don't want to say over the phone," I said.

"Then how do I know this isn't bullshit?" he shot back.

"It isn’t. I'm just…I was nervous to come forward because the other night I was out hunting. At night, with a spotlight. So I was afraid I'd get in trouble," I said, lying through my teeth.

"And I saw his body out there, and he'd been shot. And like I said, I was scared so I went home. And then next morning I went out to check on him again, 'cause I was gonna come in to the station and tell somebody, but I wanted to be sure it was him because I couldn't really tell. I knew him, but the crows, they'd pecked his skin and his eyes and it was dark –"

"Yeah, they'll do that," Daley interjected.

"But I went up in the morning and the body was gone," I said, trying to sound freaked out by the experience.

"And you're sure he was dead?" I asked.

"I mean, he looked pretty dead. His body was stiff and there was a bullet hole in his neck and like I said he was all pecked-"

"Ok, ok -  well, can you show me where this was?" he asked, now all of a sudden Officer Friendly.

"Yeah, but, like, I don't want to make a big deal out of it, you know? So maybe, like, just you?"

He sighed. I hoped he wouldn't call my bluff but I was banking on Daley being the type of guy who would want all the glory for himself.

And he probably figured this was just a kid fucking around anyway, so if he sounded the alarm and it ended up being a prank, no one would see him with egg on his face.

"Where can I meet you?" he asked, giving into the temptation of glory.

"You know where Lowell Street dead-ends at the bottom of Morrison Hill, by that old brick building?" I asked.

"The old Karlis' Taxidermy, yeah."

"I can meet you there in a half hour," I said and hung up.

\*\*\*

I stood in the bushes next to the remains of what had apparently been Karlis' Taxidermy. The bricks were crumbling and I could see inside the building. There were broken beer bottles from kids partying and graffiti covered the walls.

I waited, listening to the birds and then there was a crunch of tires on the gravel road. The brakes on Daley's cruiser squeaked as they came to a stop and I stepped out from the bushes.

He got out and didn’t go for his gun or anything like that.

"Michael Garrison's kid, ain't you?" he asked.

"Yes, sir," I said, wanting to be as polite as possible so he knew I wasn't fucking around.

"Shame about your ma," he said.

*Shame about Jesse's dad*, I thought.

He nodded toward the ridges over his shoulder that led up toward Morrison Hill.

"So up here's where you said you seen him?"

"That's right," I said and I could feel sweat on my palms.

"Why don't we take a walk and you can show me?" he said.

I nodded and started for the path that snaked into the woods, my eyes on the ground. He followed behind me.

"You know it's a serious crime to be out hunting at night. But…if you help figure out this thing, I think maybe the wardens will let you off with a slap on the wrist, community service, picking up trash on the side of route 2 or some shit."

*Uh huh*, was all I said.

It was maybe a fifteen minute walk to where we were going. Occasionally, Daley would try to shoot the shit about something or other – the strike or the weather or what I was going to do after graduation.

"Try to get on number ten paper machine, probably," I answered to that question. Daley responded with a oh yut because, of course that's what I was going to do. So was everyone else.

As we climbed higher, he huffed and puffed behind me, apparently Buckton PD didn't have a rigorous fitness regimen.

We were close to the top which meant the clearing was nearby. The ground grew steep and I could hear him laboring behind me so I stopped as his shoes slipped on some leaves. He grabbed the trunk of a skinny alder to steady himself and took a break.

It was unseasonably warm for November and I took my Red Sox cap off my head and wiped the sweat off my forehead.

Daley eyed my cap as I pulled it back down over my forehead.

"Still can't fucking believe they blew that. You know I don't blame Buckner, or Stanley, or Gedman, or Schiraldi, or even McNamara. You know who I blame?"

I shook my head no, but I had a decent idea where he was going. If you don't know what those five names have in common, allow me to explain -

"I blame Rice. Couldn't score on a fucking double that Evans hit to fucking Brooklyn, that lazy..."

Yeah. He went there. He pulled the ripcord on the big one.

The five guys he mentioned - who all share a good portion of the blame for the Sox losing Game 6 of the 1986 World Series to the Mets were all, in fact, white.

Jim Rice who made a base running gaffe way back in the first inning of the game, is of course, black.

It wasn't the first time I'd heard the word. You don't grow up where I did and avoid it. And maybe it was because I knew what Daley had coming that I had the courage to say something.

If some kid had used the word in the football locker room, would I have spoken up? No. No fucking way. Because that would have required real guts, and I was in short supply of those.

But I looked at him, dead in the eyes and said, "You killed Mr. Cross, you piece of shit."

Daley's jaw went slack and I spun around and kept walking.

"Why you little mouthy fucking cocksucking –"

"Fuck off," I said as we entered the clearing. I looked at Ulric's log and it was empty.

"I'm gonna-"

I whipped back around to Daley.

"You're gonna fucking what, Daley, you dumb fuck," I said opening my jacket, inviting him to have at it. Put one in me.

"You're gonna shoot me, is that it? Go for it. I don't think you have the balls," I taunted him.

He reached for his gun and I started to get a little nervous because Ulric was still nowhere to be found.

"You mouthy little weasel fuck. I'm going to shoot you and bury you like a dog. Because nobody fucking knows I'm out here with you and no one would give a shit anyway. And then I'm going to go home and jerkoff and think about the world class blow job your mother gave me to get out of a speeding ticket," he said and he laughed.

I balled up my fists and maybe I was going to charge him and maybe I'd end up dead. But then I saw Ulric standing next to him.

If he had eyebrows – and he didn't – they would have been raised at me saying, *well what do we have here?*

I realized Daley couldn't see Ulric next to him.

"Well boy," Ulric said to me, "What'll it be?"

"I want to pass it on to this pig fuck," I said.

"What the fuck did you say?" Daley asked, half outraged, half confused.

"I said, I want to pass-"

And then, Ulric had one of his hooked knives out and he slashed it across Daley's bloated stomach.

He dropped to a knee, bleating in pain. He wasn't long for that position as he flopped over onto his side and continued groaning.

Ulric pounced on him, crouching on his chest like a gargoyle. Then he looked at me.

"What are you waiting for?" he said. I took this to mean I should come to him, so I did.

Ulric had his forearm pressed on Daley's throat. The cop's eyes looked as if they were going to pop out of his head and I realized he could see Ulric now.

"Go ahead. Pass it to him," Ulric hissed.

There was a rumble deep in my stomach and I dropped to my knees. The taste in my mouth was as if I'd chewed a thousand matchsticks.

I lowered my head toward Daley's trembling mouth. I heard him whimper. I parted my lips and a beetle crawled out from them, and went right between Daley's teeth and down his fat gullet.

"Oh, that's a good one. A real corker, yes!" Ulric squealed.

He released the pressure from Daley's throat and I stood. I watched as thousands of little heads began to poke through his skin, burrowing outward. I watched as they consumed his big fucking murdering body.

Ulric laughed and so did I.

\*\*\*

The whole Klan part of this might surprise you since this we weren't some sundown town in Mississippi or Alabama. The 20th Maine saved the Union at Gettysburg for fuck's sake. That fact didn't give us some kind of lifetime pass for racial tolerance or anything. But still.

Or maybe it doesn't surprise you at all, given the last ten or so years of this great American experiment of ours.

I'd always thought we were different than those places south of the Mason-Dixon line. In my view, the Grand State of Maine had always been a bit more progressive, at least from my biased white man's perspective.

But maybe I just wasn't looking in the right places, or maybe I chose to ignore it. It's also hard to see it in practice when most everyone looks the same.

I thought maybe our casual racism was different than their practical racism. But after all these years, I'm not sure there was much of a distinction.

But in the eighties, the Klan was struggling to stay relevant, and any port in a storm, they figured. And believe me, there was a storm. The strike was ugly.

Family against family, union against salaried, union against scabs. The bars (and we had the most bars per capita of any town in the northeast, you can look that one up) were a bucket of blood. Most places stopped serving bottles and pint glasses and went to plastic cups.

The back issues of the Falls Times are littered with accounts of shotguns fired through pickup truck windows and Molotov cocktails tossed on front porches. Jesse Jackson mentioned our plight in his speech at the 1988 Democratic National Convention.

But when the Klan came, people pulled together. They lined up on Congress Street and watched them march through town, and everybody crowded the sidewalks to tell them they weren't welcome.

It was somehow the one decent thing that came out of the strike. The union certainly didn't make any material gains and management forever lost the trust of their workers.

The Klan did have about a dozen or so locals join up with them to march, but that was it. The rest of the people jeered them. Booed them. Spit at them. Some threw rocks. Now, I'm not saying that was the right thing to do – but sometimes it's the only thing you can do.

I wasn't there to see that part though. I had to watch it on the news and read about it in the papers. Because I was out at the Bowman farm, and I was waiting. And we'll get to that part soon, I promise.

But the fact is, Grand Dragon Homer Harlon Graves by way of Springdale, Arkansas had it coming just as bad as Paul Daley.

You don't rise up the ranks of the Klan in the Deep South in the 50's and 60's because you're competent manager of white supremacist personnel. No, you need a few lynchings notched in the old belt.

The night before the march, I had got in my beat-to-shit Nissan pickup and drove out to the only motel in town, the Purple Iris. I knew that's where they'd be staying.

I parked in the shadows with the rifle across my lap and waited. I wouldn't need it, but I had it along just in case. Shortly after ten o'clock, a caravan of trucks pulled into the lot. I slid down in the seat, peering over the dash.

I couldn't make out their faces in the lights outside of the rooms. But when the driver's side door of a big old Ford swung open, a hulking giant of a man got out.

That was him. I recognized him from the pictures in the paper and how he towered over the others, the motel lights shining off his bald head.

I watched him shuffle toward the main office, hauling a duffel bag. I felt my fingers run along the smooth, oiled barrel of my father's gun. Felt the urge to jump out of the cab and take him down right there.

But that wouldn't work. That's not how any of this worked. I couldn't do that and rid myself of this.

I had to pass it on.
