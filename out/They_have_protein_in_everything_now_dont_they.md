Ive been going to the gym every other day since it happened. I know it’s a tale as old as time, but what can I say? It’s a good and effective salve for heartbreak. The first couple weeks were great. I saw different muscle striations and all that pop up in my mirror and was quite pleased with myself. But like most other people, the progress eventually plateaued and I was forced to accept in resignation that this was as good as it would get for the next few months.

A few months pass and I saw no progress, but like a diligent little soldier I kept marching on. After about a year, I saw that I had made no more progress than I did in the first couple weeks of going to the gym. I’d watched every workout regimen on YouTube, followed every content creator, subscribed to a monthly protein powder delivery service but the results were frustratingly, incrementally tiny. It was to the point that all this work felt pointless, and the weights simply refused to go up even a few digits.

Eventually, out of frustration, I gave up for a few weeks as I felt like I was simply destined to be a non-responder to any kind of progressive overload. What changed my mind and forced me to back into that room full of soulless motivation was scrolling through Instagram and finding my crush fawning over this musclebound dude at some party. It looked like it was my only course of action, but I had to do something drastic to make what I wanted to happen, happen. Something back-alley. Now I know what some of you may have to say about something like this. Oh, the side-effects aren’t worth it! The roid rage would drive me nuts! My balls would shrink to nothing!

I simply didn’t care. In my hopeless ambition to be as sculpted as social media’s finest, I wanted to leave no stones unturned, even if it meant losing mine. Fortunately for me, a friend I made in the gym, a musclebound freakshow that inspired nothing but awe in me, told me that he had what I needed if I ever decided waiting two years to bench 225 was too much for me. He could make it happen in less than 2 months!

I saw him near the squat racks where he usually resided grunting in ways that would make anyone around blush. Ignoring the obnoxious display of strength, I walked up to him and waited for him to finish his set. I told him I was ready for the supposed back-alley super soldier serum he had mentioned a year into him watching me frequent the gym. He asked me if I was sure, as there would be no going back after I took the PEDs. I’d have to accept all aspects of it wholeheartedly, side-effects and everything.

At that point, I had researched this field enough that I felt like I knew everything I needed to know about PEDs. I was willing to accept the risks and a blood pressure, the magnitude of a firehose. Est quod id est and I told him to bring it on. I was a lonely, tiny man with not much to lose. He asked me to meet him at a friend’s place around 11 p.m. Thursday night later that week.

Come 11 p.m. Thursday and I was at this address he had given me. I rang the doorbell and Muscle Dude’s friend showed up to usher me in. He once again asked me if I was sure about this, as the side effects that he refused to elaborate on, to protect the experimental nature of their operation, could get quite demanding of my body. I had already made up my mind at that point and agreed to their terms and conditions, verbally of course. They also asked me about my sexual exploits which I thought was odd but I wasn’t going to make it seem like I was a loser who didn’t get none.

The dose was a one-time thing which struck me as odd, but like you can probably already tell at this point, I’m as water headed as the stereotypes about bodybuilders might suggest. They stuck me with the needle and sent me home. Their only instructions were to take it easy and do what I had been doing up to that point. Dang, this shit was easy! Why aren’t more people on this?

I woke up to an unnerving breathlessness in my bedroom the next morning. Wondering what might have caused it, I looked around to see that everything was as it should be. My hamster LeBron James had escaped his cage but that was nothing out of the ordinary. I’d find him eventually under the couch munching on a seed. Probably. I assigned my strange experience to the drug and went on with my day. After work I drove to the gym to find my buddy wasn’t anywhere to be seen. This was unlike him. Either way, those numbers shot up from the last time, and you simply can’t fathom the joy I felt. My tris and pecs also seemed to be leaps and bounds bigger than they usually are, and I was glad to see that the drug was working.

I went out to a nightclub later that week with a few of my friends and found that I actually had women eyeing me. That had never happened before and I wasn’t complaining! My new-found confidence had me chatting up a few women and before long I had found someone who wanted to do the horizontal tango with me. Pardon my phrasing.

I couldn’t make it happen. After all that work, it simply refused to answer my call. My new friend was sympathetic and after doing the deed, partially, we promptly fell asleep. I woke up to the other half of the bed being empty and the same breathlessness I had experienced the other day. I assumed she had left before I woke up and thought nothing of it.

Over the course of the week, I still hadn’t seen my PED buddy at the gym and despite my overwhelming naiveté, the thoughts in my head finally crescendo-ed to a sneaking suspicion. Ignoring the obvious red flags that this drug and my buddy had presented, I went about my week, till eventually I found myself at the same nightclub picking up another girl.

The same thing happened again. Whatever.

I still couldn't find LeBron and I was starting to worry I had a tiny little casket I needed to buy. I shoved the thoughts out of my head as I got up to admire myself in the mirror and how sculpted I was starting to look. Just 45 minutes today though. Have a tight schedule to stick to, you know. I installed a camera that gave me a good view of my studio in case LeBron decided to show up.

Fast-forward a week and I was bringing home a girl for the third week in a row. This was unprecedented but I wasn’t about to question my luck. Guess all it really did take was a sculpted body. I thought to myself, “Tonight’s the night. It’s going to happen again.” Seems like I self-actualized into an ED patient, but I had a pill that was going to help with that. Finally, having the done the deed in full, we promptly fell asleep.

I woke up next to the no one. The breathlessness now ever-present.

This was starting to take a toll on my mental health and I started to ponder whether drunken hookups were really my thing. I was curious how I did not notice her leaving and how my door was locked from the inside. Couldn’t picture her jumping out the window unless she could fit a parachute in the handbag she had. My mental acumen decided to surprise me and reminded me that I had a camera that overlooked my small studio and that it wasn’t pervy to have footage of a dalliance with a stranger if I wasn’t going to upload it for a quick buck.

Anyway, I played the footage from last night and what I saw was hard to describe. Around 3 a.m. I turned into an amorphous blob. My bones reached the consistency of jelly. My facial features stretched across a now featureless face and I spread over this woman whose name I did not remember and with a sickening crunch of what I can only assume was her bones, started to engulf and consume her. I could see the outline of her face pushing against my skin, trying to escape. All of this was horrifying to watch but I put myself though it with a macabre sense of curiosity.

If this was what it took to become just another generic Instagram model, then this was not what I signed up for. Regardless of what you say happened earlier in this story. Now guilty of manslaughter, I drove to the address Mr. Clean had given me, and I found that no one came to the door. Day after day, week after week, I found that no one occupied the property. I did not know what to do and in a bid to vindicate myself, decided to scrape it under the rug and forget it ever happened.

That was it for my sex-life I suppose. No more organic matter in my bedroom was my solution for a while. I guess I could just wait for the drug to wear off. I swear I’m not a psychopath. I just feel very little in terms of emotion and guilt.

As the weeks went by, my face started to look gaunter and hollower. People brought up my appearance and recommended I rest up as I looked like a live action Cruella. I took their advice and started to rest a lot more. The gym which started all of this was now the least of my concerns. I was worried I’d be a part of someone’s investigations but fortunately, I did not seem to have to answer for my crimes. Not that I intended to anyway. Id erased the footage of my midnight snacking, so I doubt I had anything to worry about.

A few weeks of taking time off from work and bed-rotting, I saw that I had started to lose the shape I had worked my ass off for. Thinking to myself, I decided I was ready to pay the price of what it took to maintain this figure. My apartment did not allow pets so I couldn’t exactly buy up the hamster section of a PetSmart to do this, so it would have to be another woman. Eh, I’d sleep on it and think about going at it tomorrow.

The Sun rose, and I tried to get out of bed. I say try because I couldn’t sit up. I had no bones. I was a shapeless blob draped over my bed like a bedsheet. I smelled putrid and had ooze oozing out of me. Was this going to be my fate now? Voice to text on my phone has helped me tell you about what has happened but as I type this, I hear clicking noises coming from my lock. My door's cracked open and I see my guy poke his hulking head through the door.

Heyy buddy, anyone coming around to look for you? Thought you said you’d have someone in that bed like every week. Did you work out what was happening? Ah well, if noones going to miss you, I sure hope you don’t mind if I take a quick nap on you, do you?
