I've experienced this unholy nightmare. It occurred a while back, almost 10 years ago, but I can never forget it.


 I've transferred schools, from a community college in Boston, to state college in Michigan. Instead of going through the hassle of looking for an apartment, I've decided to live on campus for the first semester. The apartment complex that I've chosen to stay in was spacious, a little more expensive, and very old. There were 4 blocks facing each other and they were due to be demolished shortly after that semester ended so a new science building is to be constructed in that space.


Once I moved and settled in my new apartment, the semester started and I went to my classes in accordance to my schedule. My classes were at odd hours that semester, I'd have a break in between my classes, so a lot of times I decided to go back to my apartment to nap since it's just a walking distance. What I do when I want to take a nap is lay on the couch and turn the tv on to watch something until I fall asleep. So after finishing one of my classes, which ended close to noon, I did just that, except this time after I fell asleep and opend my eyes, I didn't see my old apartment, I saw reddish space, and I couldn't move. I just realized that the couch that I was napping on was no more. I felt whatever my body was strapped to started to move. I couldn't see what that thing was, and I am glad that I didn't try to see it because it was embracing my back and holding my body tightly with its left arm. As this creature started moving, for some reason it tried to reach my groin area with its right hand. The hand was large and looked very old with long nails, not overly long but pointy, I tried resisting so I tried to pinch whatever my fingers were grabbing on to, which felt like old saggy skin. It seemed that did something because as soon as I started pinching, as hard as I could, the hand retracted and that unholy creature made that awful high pitched noise, similar to the noise cats make when they are being protective of their babies, then the body started moving faster. That when I woke up screaming while heavily breathing and my heart was racing, and later on it occurred to me did I fall asleep on my back? Because I don't remember if I was sleeping on the side while watching TV. 


Never in my life have I experienced anything like this. I must mention that I experience sleep paralyze a lot, which I'd take any day over this, but this vision was nothing like that, it felt real, and I can't forget how that skin felt. The only logical unlogical explanation I can think of is that this apartment was used in some unholy ritual to summon this thing, for sexual pleasure?, but it did not realize that the one who's currently living here is someone else, or it was testing the water to see if I was into this shit.


After this, as a religious person myself, and believe in the supernatural but in no way do I aspire to medal beyond what our vision can see, so please don't try to open your third eye. Anytime I would sleep, I'd have the Quran playing which we Muslims believe to dispel spirits that intend to harm you. I've been on panic mode like that for days, but the habit of playing something in the background never died even after moving twice. 


This seemed a bit silly as I typed it, but I can't think of a better place to post this. I've been meaning to write it for a while, but not sure why I decided to do it now and I wonder if anyone has experienced a similar thing.
