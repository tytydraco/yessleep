it started as a normal day full of apathy as usual I walked into school thinking about my stomach pains ever since I had my morning Cup of tea (Yorkshire tea gold of course) but enough of that, the day was mostly normal the odd shouting and screaming from the year 7s (for my friends in America that’s 6th grade) but in lesson 3 nature called and it was pissed I got to the toilet and opened the floodgates, 10-15 minutes later I finish cleaning myself up and walk out and there and there are 20-25 students (I go to a school with about 1000 students) they look like they have a few blisters on their hands and all of them no matter their heritage looked as pale as the moon but their eyes were bloodshot.

Chapter 1, the zombies

I did the thing that my brain and my body desperately warned me against, I left the toilets and wandered the school the fact that they didn’t give 2 shits about me really helped my courage to walk about, I found out it wasn’t just the students who were under the effect of the zombification and I saw Mr Barling just meandering down the hall like… well, like a zombie I crept down to the design and technology area and found something quite gruesome, a corpse half eaten with a pale face and blistered hands it was so horrific I almost threw up on the spot but I held it in, barley, I had to keep quiet because now there was a new threat for me to acknowledge a rattle echoed from the room next to me I, like a fool peered in through the window (I don’t know why but my school has these windows on the walls of classrooms so you can look in and out it’s weird I know) but what I saw was not nice it was another zombie but it was a different type an aggressive one it looked as though it was scratched and bitten it was less pale and had no blisters but it had claws, It was looking for something I couldn’t look away until it turned to my direction I ducked but I knew I was too late it had saw me.

Chapter 2, Run

I sprinted as hard as I could and from behind me I heard a door come flying off it’s hinges it didn’t seem too fast because it’s leg was clearly broken, it’s last meal must’ve put up a fight, I ran and ran, jumped up 4 steps at a time with my lanky ass legs and skipped 2-3 steps at a time going down the opposite side of the building but it could still keep up, after looping a couple of times I managed to get a big enough lead that I made the decision to grab a fire extinguisher and hide in the gym, it seemed to lose me so I quietly opened the door (thank god they’re well maintained so it didn’t creak) I swung as hard as I could bonking it over the head knocking it to the floor and I hit it over and over until it’s head was just mush, I placed the extinguisher on the floor and almost cried of relief I retreated back to the gym and sat their thinking about all this.

Chapter 3, the preparations

My stomach yearned for the sweet embrace of food and therefore I had to satiate it, the body laying outside the gym door seemed to have drawn in some unwanted visitors to investigate 2 more Angry zombie brained students looking like the last one, luckily the gym is directly above the Sports Hall looking down on it like a balcony, (like a basketball court but for more types of sports) I found some plastic skipping ropes and tied 8 of them together and tied 3 to the starting rope then tied them to the heaviest things I could find including, a stationary bike thing a rowing machine and another bike I toss the makeshift rope over the railing and began to descend, it felt sketchy as all hell but it functioned so it was fine for me I reached the bottom with some line left to spare, I walked through the P.E. corridor expecting more angries but no, silence, I made my way towards my goal but then as I entered a group of the docile and pale ones began eating each other I hid and grabbed as many snacks that could be eaten quietly as I could then took a different way back to the sports hall, I arrived at my shady rope and used all of my might to pull me up I reached the top then quickly pulled the ropes up after, then I barricaded the door with some skipping ropes by tying them around the handles then covered the windows with 2 crash mats and I then hid in the secondary room to the gym which smells like 3 things, fish, chips, and deodorant mixed with body odor, I have no idea about the sense of smell on these creatures but I can’t be too careful, I am currently sitting on a crash mat in the secondary gym room typing this leaving will be challenging because there are more angry ones outside the building, I will update when I can
