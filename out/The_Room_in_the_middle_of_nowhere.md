I woke up to the surroundings of the box I had become accustomed to, but not comfortable with. Four blue painted walls, and a white ceiling, with one window on the left wall. I was technically allowed to wander the rest of the house, and even outside, but it was mostly pointless, as escaping was impossible. There was nothing but road and trees for miles, and I had no access to any form of transportation. Supposedly I’d only been there for two years, but it felt like it’d been eternity.

BANG BANG BANG!!! 

I jolted up, flooding with adrenaline, feeling I was about to be attacked.

“GET YOUR FUCKING ASS UP!!!” He said.

I was scared to say anything, but also scared to stay silent. There was no right way to react.

“OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR BEFORE I BUST THE GODDAMN THING DOWN!!!”

“What?!?!?!?” I asked, trying to sound as if I just woke up confused.

“YOU FUCKING HEARD ME! NOW GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE, NOW GODDAMIT NOW!”

I was scared to open that door, and I was scared to leave the room. The room was like a prison for me, but also a sort of safe space, like a base. I had no real right to it though, even though I wasn’t allowed to leave.

“YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO GET THE FUCKING HELL OUTSIDE AND MOW THE GODDAMN LAWN, HURRY THE FUCKING HELL UP!!!” BANG!

That son of a bitch had to finish with one last bang, as if it were a gunshot, or the devil himself trying to force his way in to drag my soul to hell, which I seemed to already be in anyway.

I had no choice but to get up and go outside. To mow his fucking lawn. I had to do all this shit when I didn’t even want to be here. I was 20 years old, but I wasn’t a guest, I was a prisoner. Despite being legally an adult, I was not allowed to leave. They seemed to do everything in their power to prevent me from having any chance of gaining my own independence and going out to get my own life.

I had been pretty restricted my whole life, but nothing as direct or severe as these past two years, especially because legally I was supposed to be able to move out, hell, even if I was going to be homeless in some city, I had that legal right as an adult. But my captors wouldn’t allow that.

I had a phone, but it was one of those cheap pay as you go phones. Not that there was any Uber or Lyft service available out in bumblefuck nowhere anyway (a smartphone is required to use the apps).

They wouldn’t even give me a ride into town so that I could try to get a job, my first job, so that I could even start saving money. Yet, they paid for all of my necessities.

It honestly made no sense that they didn’t just kick me out, even if I were to die in the woods. Maybe I could jack someone’s car and get the hell out of this void. 

“Fuck this”, I said. “I’m just going to try walking into town.

I got dressed and exited the room. If I even tried to eat anything first, he’d explode into a goddamn rage. Whatever, I just wanted out of there. I had no idea how I’d commute back and forth if I got a job, but I was just desperate to try something. Maybe they’d give me a ride if I actually got a job.

I walked outside, straight down the dirt and gravel driveway, and into the surprisingly paved road. 

“HEY! WHERE THE FUCKING HELL ARE YOU GOING?!?!?”, He yelled like a psycho killer.

“I’m just walking first, since I just got up”, I replied.

“GET YOUR LAZY FUCKING ASS BACK HERE AND MOW THIS GODDAMN LAWN!!!” The maniac yelled.

“I’ll do it as soon as I get back.”

“GET YOUR LAZY FUCKING ASS BACK HERE RIGHT GODDAMN NOW!!!”

He always had to be so vulgar. Was that supposed to seem more intimidating? He must have thought yelling at the top of his lungs like a rage-aholic wasn’t enough. He had to use swear words to sound more aggressive and intimidating.

I just kept walking, trying to ignore him.

“YOU SON OF A MOTHERFUCKING BITCH!!!”, the psychopath yelled at me.

I expected him to run after me, but instead he walked back towards the house. But just a few moments later, he was driving in the car after me.

He pulled up right beside me before slowing down to match my walking speed.

“HEY! GET YOUR FUCKING ASS BACK TO THE HOUSE!!!”

I just kept walking, not saying a word.

“FINE! THEN YOU CAN PAY RENT!”

He sharply turned around and sped back to the house.

I needed a job to be able to pay rent, those dumbasses wouldn’t let me even try to get a job, they wouldn’t give me a fucking chance.

I was done being controlled though. I was done letting obstacles get in the way, and higher powers dictating everything. I didn’t give a fucking shit if it was “God’s plan” or what the fucking hell ever. Was I disobeying God? I was already in Hell anyway, and I didn’t really see any DEFINITIVE proof or evidence of a god. And even if so, what right did God have to do this to me? He had the right because he created me, and everyone and everything? I didn’t care, I had freewill and feelings, I wanted agency over my own life, I wasn’t a goddamn NPC.

I walked for over three hours, but I was STILL way out in the middle of nowhere. Nothing but trees and road, not even a single house or farm in sight. This couldn’t be right.

I was starving, tired, sweating, and burning from the sun. I was so thirsty. I felt like I was about to pass out any second. If I died, at least I died trying to get my freedom.

There had been dozens of calls from him, on my piece of shit pay as you go phone. I had minutes, but I wouldn’t answer, because I was done being held hostage. I was dead set on escaping into civilization now. I was even considering going to be homeless in some big city, just for a CHANCE, at life. 

I don’t know how there isn’t even a single gas station for over 10 goddamn miles.” I thought to myself. Driving a car was the only real mode of transportation around here, and they didn’t even have a fuel center for this long of a distance?

I wouldn’t go back no matter what though, I would escape into the world or die trying.

They were insane, absolutely insane. They demanded I do something, but blew up and got in my way to stop me when I tried. 

They didn’t want me to gain my freedom, they just wanted me to be their prisoner, their slave.

I could call the police to escape my captivity, but I had nowhere else to go anyway. I had nowhere else to go now, but I refused to stay in that prison for another second. 

I wish I at least brought some water bottles with me, but I had to leave the moment I got up.

BANG BANG BANG!!!

The banging on the door echoed in my head, and would haunt me for the rest of my physical existence. 

I’d pray, but I felt like God must want me to stay there, my circumstances were so severe and ridiculous. I’d go to Hell before I went back to that house, they’d have to drag my dead body back. Even if my soul was dragged to Hell, at least I’d be free from that house prison.

Here he comes with his BS apology to manipulate me back in. Maybe I’m already in fucking Hell, or Purgatory.

Out in the world, is better in some ways, but worse in others.

Existence is torture.
