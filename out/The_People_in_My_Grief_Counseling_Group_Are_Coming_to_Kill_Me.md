I used to have a post up where I explained how this all started, but I deleted it.

At the time, I thought I was just being paranoid — reading too much into things.

I was embarrassed. I didn’t want to look crazy.

I wish I hadn’t deleted it now.

If you missed it, this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/2E7E763PV5) covers some of what happened before, but things are different now.

Things have gotten worse. Way worse.

I didn’t want to go back to the grief group after what happened in my last post. 

I thought avoiding it would keep me safe.

I was emotionally exhausted and frightened. I had eventually confided in my parents about everything and told them that I needed space. 

I don’t think they believed me in the slightest but deep down, they knew something was genuinely troubling me. 

It was ironic that the place that was supposed to feel safest ended up feeling like a trap I’d willingly walked into.

I pulled away and for a brief bit, things seemed like they were returning to normal. 

But that’s when I kept seeing them — the other members — everywhere.

For example, I stopped off at the grocery store to pick up a couple of things last week, and that’s when I saw Mark. 

He was standing in front of the cereal aisle, staring at the same shelf like he’d forgotten what food was.

I was friendly enough and gave him a small wave, but he didn’t move or seem to register that I was there.

He just stood there with one hand outstretched toward a box of Frosted Flakes like he was stuck in a paused commercial.

It was like the lights were on, but nobody was home if you catch my drift.

Then I saw Lillian hanging out near the library. I didn’t say anything to her, but she was sitting on a bench with an orange popsicle melting in her hand. 

She kept repeating the same sentence:

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

It was like witnessing a computer malfunction in real time. 

I ignored it and went about my business; I didn’t want anything to do with the grief group after last time.

But that all changed when I saw Greg at the park where Eli and I used to hang out a couple days ago.

When I was walking past him, something was...wrong.

His eyes were glazed over, blinking too slowly as he tossed breadcrumbs to the birds.

Except… he wasn’t.

His hand moved in a slow, looping rhythm — but nothing left his fingers.

He was mimicking the motion.

And the birds? They weren’t eating.

They were just still —watching with heads tilted.

“Greg?” I called out, concerned at what I was seeing.

He turned, his movements stiff and his eyes flickering with irritation.

“Do I know you?” 

“Yeah, I’m Lucas. We go to counseling together.”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He tossed a couple more breadcrumbs to the birds near his feet.

“Sure you do, you lost your brother like I did. You said that your brother avoided spaghetti because the sauce smelled like pennies.” 

Greg shot me an angry glare and turned his back to me.

“I don’t know who you are, but you need to leave right now.” 

“I’m sorry.” I left in a hurry, not wanting to make the situation any more uncomfortable than it already was.

Something was deeply wrong.

Against my better judgment, I decided that I would go back to get answers.

I wasn’t going to go during a session though; I was going to go after hours.

I told myself it was just to calm my nerves, to prove there was nothing strange about it.

But deep down, I knew that wasn’t true. I wasn’t going there to be reassured — I was going there to find what had scared me away.

If there were answers to what was happening to them — to me — they’d be hidden there, in that circle of chairs where all of this began.



I left my parents’ house at around 8 p.m. 

They were off at some trivia night for a fundraiser they were passionate about.  I think they hoped I’d join them but I wasn’t really interested.

I had more important matters to attend to tonight. I couldn’t.

The sun had just dropped below the horizon as I circled the community center on foot to kill time.

The streetlights were slowly flickering to life one by one, and the traffic of people’s daily commutes were becoming quieter.

I watched my phone screen as the time grew closer to 9 pm, signaling the close of the community center and tonight’s session.

I waited for the place to clear out, for everyone to come outside so that I could sneak in before the doors locked.

But nobody ever came out. 

I stood outside and watched the time on my phone go from 9:05 pm to 9:45 pm. 

By 9:52, no one had come out.

I could’ve gone home. I told myself that more than once. 

But the part of me that needed answers — that part of me didn’t care how scared I was. 

The worst thing I could do would be to find out I was right.

Nobody had walked out yet.

What gives? Why was nobody leaving?

I tried the front door, but it was locked.

I looked inside the windows and was greeted with darkness.

I couldn’t see anything so I lifted on the window to see if it would budge.

Thankfully, it was unlocked, and I managed to crawl inside.

The air inside was stale with a mixture of old coffee grounds, paper, and like something had been left to rot inside the walls.

With a series of coughs, I stepped onto the floor and let the window fall shut behind me with a soft click.

The main hallway was lit only by a flickering EXIT sign in the distance. 

I passed the front desk and noticed the guest sign-in sheet was still out. 

I didn’t mean to look, but there it was — my name.

It had been written repeatedly on every line, signed in my handwriting. 

The dates went back years, even before I was alive.

The bulletin board near the front desk was still cluttered with yoga fliers, potluck invitations, and missing pet notices — but they all appeared to have had all the color sucked out of them. 

There was a new flyer tacked to the bottom corner — torn at the edge like it had been ripped from a child’s notebook.

I paused to read what it said:

“Grief Group – Tuesday’s @ 7 PM – Bring your most cherished memory.”

Beneath it, in messy, childish handwriting:

“He dotted his i’s with bubble circles.”

I blinked and saw that the flyer had vanished completely.

Had I imagined it?

I didn’t let myself dwell on it as I kept moving forward through the dark.

My phone vibrated in my pocket. A new text lit up the screen.: 

Mom: “Hope you're okay. Trivia just ended — we’re heading home soon. ❤️”

I stared at it longer than I meant to.

I could’ve gone with them, but instead, I was here pursuing something I didn’t fully understand.

I turned the phone’s light off and kept walking, not bothering to reply.

I strained my ears for any kind of sound — a creak, a whisper, a shuffle — but there was nothing, only silence.

I could only hear the sound of my own blood moving through my veins.

I crept farther down the hallway, my steps muffled by the old tile. 

The reeking stench of rot continued to grow stronger the closer I got to the counseling room.

I pressed my sleeve to my face, but it didn’t help. 

The scent was in the air, but also in the paint, the carpet, the wood…everything. 

It was like an infected wound left unbandaged.

I hesitated, my hand hovering near the frame, the door was already partially cracked open.

I pushed it open slowly…not sure what to expect on the other side.

I stifled a scream at the scene before me.

They were seated in a circle, the other members of the grief therapy group.

They were sitting silently in their chairs, completely motionless and seemingly unaware of my presence.

“Hello?” I called, my voice echoing.

There was no response. They didn’t even flinch when I stepped closer to them.

The eyes in their blank faces were open and fogged over, their limbs limp and slack.

They looked like puppets, staged for an audience that never came.

I backed up toward the window, my heartbeat hammering in my ears.

My breath hitched and I took a step back, but the silence around me thickened.

That’s when I heard her voice:

“Lucas.”

The voice slithered out from the far corner of the room as she slowly and deliberately emerged.

Jean.

Her green eyes glowed faintly in the dark, catching the flicker of the exit sign like an animal's. 

Her teeth smiled, but her skin didn’t follow.

“Who are they? What is this place?” The questions poured out of me as I met her gaze, determined to not let her see how scared I was.

She tilted her head, studying me like an insect under a microscope, her body looked half-sculpted out of shadow.

“They’re empty now,” she said, almost fondly. “Just… leftovers.”

She circled one of the group members — Jonah — and placed a hand gently on his shoulder. His head lolled slightly at her touch.

“Grief rots the soul in the most delicious ways. These?” She gestured at the others. “They were a buffet, nothing more than a tasting menu of sorrow. I’ve taken everything worth keeping.”

“You’re sick,” I spat.

She only smiled wider. “No, Lucas. I’m just very hungry.”

“What does that make you?” 

It was a question I most wanted to know despite dreading what I might hear.

Her eyes turned a darker shade as her features changed into something monstrous for a brief second.

“Are you sure you want to know?”

I swallowed the lump in my throat and looked at the group. Their heads remained still, but now I could hear a song playing in the distance.

Like a broken lullaby playing in an empty room, it echoed off-key and gradually grew louder.

“What else should I be... all apologies...”

I felt my blood turn ice-cold, not just because I recognized the song, but because it wasn’t coming from a speaker.

It was leaking out of Jonah’s now open, unhinged mouth.

He looked like a snake attempting to swallow its prey.

“Why do you know this song?” I asked, nervousness creeping into my voice.

Jean stepped closer, her features changing from human to monster and back to human in rapid succession.

Her pupils spread until they swallowed the green entirely and her skin thinned and tightened as if something beneath was pressing outward, desperate to crawl free. 

Her mouth stretched open widely, revealing a second row of teeth nested deep inside her throat, glistening like sunlight on glass. 

Behind them, I saw an eye blink.

It was Eli’s eye.

And it was watching me intently…

The air escaped my chest and my knees buckled…

Then it was gone, replaced by her human face again, as though nothing had happened.

“Because it’s yours, his, hers, and all of theirs.”

She pointed to each individual member in the circle as I stared at their lifeless bodies. 

 “What do you mean? None of this makes any sense. What do we and Eli have to do with you?”

Jean gave a small, pitying smile. “You mourn in a single thread, Lucas. But I walk the whole tapestry.”

She circled me like a shark that smelled blood in the water, methodical and precise.

“Do you really think you were the only one who had him? They all did — in places you’ll never see, in timelines you never touched. I’ve just consumed every drop of their pain until they became a husk of the person they were before. They only exist here, but everywhere else, they’re nothing.”

I felt all the color drain from my skin at the revelation.

“You’re lying.”

She didn’t flinch. “Grief is a powerful thing that tethers us to the most precious gift of all, memory. I show up where it pools and festers. I don’t create the pain — I just know how to find it.”

Her movements were unnatural, as though her body were lagging, catching up a fraction of a second too late.

Her fingers elongated, thinning into brittle shafts of yellow light and clicked against each other like insect mandibles.

I realized with dawning horror what they looked like.

Sun Sticks.

Eli’s Sun Sticks.

Except now they were splintered and curved at the ends like talons.

“I’ve worn many names and faces in the eons since my creation, but to feed on a pain as pure as yours Lucas... I had to be Jean.”

I wanted to cry, but not out of fear, but because seeing those beautiful, stupid little sticks we used to make had now twisted into weapons.

It felt as though Eli was being torn apart right in front of me.

“I need your grief to finish what I’ve started.”

Behind her, the others began to shift.

At first, just the slightest movements — a twitch of the hand, a slow turn of the head.

Then, they all began to murmur in soft, disjointed unison.

"All in all is all we are..."

The phrase repeated, growing louder and more distorted than the last, until the sound vibrated through the walls and crawled up my spine.

“It’s your turn to share.” Mark’s tone was flat and lacking any emotion. 

I watched them stand and approach me in small, jerky motions until they surrounded me in a loose circle.

“Eli’s gone,” Lillian whispered. “Share with us.”

“No, this isn’t real.” I closed my eyes, trying my hardest to convince myself that this was all just a nightmare.

Jean stepped towards me, her fingers twitched excitedly as they touched my cheek. 

“Don’t fight it. You’re the main course.”

She rubbed the tips together in a slow, circular motion — the same way Eli used to roll the Sun Sticks between his palms, warming them up before handing me one.

Seeing her mimic a ritual that was precious to me made something inside me snap.

“GET AWAY FROM ME!!!” I declared as I pulled away and ran towards the window.

I shoved past Shane and pulled the window open as I felt hands grip my ankle tightly. 

I could feel myself being pulled back in, but I thrashed around and kicked wildly until I was able to crawl through the window and fall to the ground outside.

As soon as my feet graced the sidewalk, I sprinted all the way home and locked the door behind me, gasping like I’d been drowning.

When I got home, the house was empty. 

I thought I’d beat them back from their trivia night at the fundraiser…but the car was in the driveway. 

All the lights were off, no note was left behind, and there was no indication that that they had been home at all.

After searching the house and not being able to locate them, I ran upstairs and immediately logged onto the computer. 

I’m typing this as fast as I can.

I need someone to know my story before I’m taken away entirely by something I can’t really comprehend.

Maybe this will be enough to warn someone, to avoid others from falling victim to…these monsters.

Wait…I hear something.

It sounded like the front door had opened.

I had locked it hadn’t I?

I called out and expected my mom or my dad to answer but nobody did.

I’m terrified right now.

I hear footsteps slowly walking up the stairs towards my room.

I hear inconsistent, strangled breathing from down the hallway — like someone trying to laugh and choke at the same time.

The footsteps have reached my door…they have stopped.

I don’t hear anything.

I can hear someone whispering as they jiggle the doorknob erratically. 

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

And then, through the crack beneath my door:

"All in all is all we are..."

I see Eli’s eye staring back at me from the reflection of my computer screen.

“It’s your turn to share, Rabbit.”
