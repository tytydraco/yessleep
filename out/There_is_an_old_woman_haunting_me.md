This sounds crazy—I’m not really a believer in ghosts or apparitions. Well, I *wasn't.* About a month ago, everything changed. My view of the afterlife and demons has completely shifted.

A little backstory: I’m 18 years old and I live in the middle of nowhere in Colorado. I mean, it’s a small town. It has a school and everything, but it’s tiny. It’s one of those places where if you do *anything,* every single person in town knows. Want a girlfriend? Everyone knows. Want to drink with your friends? Everyone knows.

I’m getting the hell out of this town as soon as I have the money. I think I’m going to move to New York. I want to live in a place where I can walk down the road and have *nobody* know my name or what I’m doing. That’s the dream for me.

Well, this story begins with me playing Xbox. I’m a pretty big gamer—my main games are *Call of Duty*, *Minecraft*, and some good old *Skate 3.* On this particular day, I was playing *Minecraft*. I was by myself, just in a survival world. Nothing crazy, just something to pass the time. It was about 1:20 a.m. My mind was wandering, thinking about my day and what I’d do tomorrow.

That’s when I saw something run across my screen.  
It snapped me out of my trance, and my heart skipped a beat. I felt the most bone-shaking shiver go down my entire body.

I sat there, endlessly staring at my screen. It really shocked me because *Minecraft* is a kids’ game—no jumpscares. After I gained composure, I just thought maybe something in the game went by the screen. That’s all I could really think. I called it a night and went to bed.

I woke up in a dark oak wood room. It was very eerie, and it smelled like something was rotting. I felt out of place, like I had just walked into something I definitely shouldn’t have seen. That’s when I saw her—an old lady standing in the doorway, directly across from the bed I had just “spawned” in.

Her skin was light gray, and her eyes were void—like I was looking into *nothing* at all—but they were so damn wide. *Unnaturally* wide. Her hair was so thin I could count every strand. She continued to stare at me with the most bone-chilling grin. I just laid there, staring at her, the silence absolutely unnerving.

I woke up gasping for air. Thankfully, it was bright out.  
I don’t usually have nightmares, and they’re never that scary—but I figured it happens to everyone, and didn’t think much of it.

I’m currently on a gap year between high school and college, so I have a lot of free time. I mostly just hang out with friends, play basketball, or play video games. Yes, I’m unemployed for now—I’m just getting settled in.

It was a very snowy day, so I decided to make some coffee and play *Call of Duty*. I was about five games in and two hours had passed—it was 3:00 p.m. Yes, I know I’m a bum, but can you blame me? It was 3 p.m. on a snow day. What else could I do?

I logged onto *Skate 3* and grinded some board sales for another two hours. I looked at my phone—it was 5:23 p.m. I finally decided to make some food. I walked out of my room and into the kitchen, and I *swear* I saw something dash across my hallway into the laundry room.  
This scared the living hell out of me.

I approached the laundry room and checked inside—there was nothing.

After making and eating my food, it was about 6:30. I decided to watch the new *Happy Gilmore* movie. I grabbed some blankets and got cozy. I almost went into a trance-like state—just zoned in on the movie. And just like that, it was over, and it was getting dark outside.

I decided to go play some *Minecraft*, so I logged into my profile and started playing. Thirty minutes in, I was working on my bunker in a survival world, when I saw something dash across my screen again. It didn’t scare me as much this time, but it definitely unsettled me. Maybe it was a glitch?

I turned off my Xbox and sat there, just contemplating—staring into a black screen.

Until I saw it again.  
A gray blob flew past my screen.

That was the moment I realized:  
That wasn’t in the game.

It was the reflection of what was behind me.
