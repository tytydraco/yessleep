Being a light sleeper has its problems. Waking up to the chirping of the crickets or when someone walks past my bedroom door. It’s almost a nightly occurrence, so I didn’t think any differently when I woke up in darkness.

I laid still, wondering why I woke up. Listening to my surroundings, I didn’t immediately hear the noise. I waited, expecting to hear the flushing of a toilet or a car beeping outside, but everything was silent.

After laying awake in bed for a couple minutes, I shrugged off the anticipated noise and closed my eyes, waiting for sleep to take over.

Then, I heard it.

It sounded like a faint wisp, a current of flowing air. It wasn’t constant, it came then stopped, came then stopped.

what could that sound be? 
I don’t have anything in my room that makes a sound like this.

I consider my options.

Could it be me breathing?

To test my theory—I hold my breath hoping the noise was simply me breathing myself awake.
The noise is still in my room.

What…the hell?

Not just because I still hear the noise, but because it sounds exclusively like someone breathing. 
I sit up, simultaneously hearing the air pockets escaping my spine, breaking the rhythmic breathing.

The first thing I see makes me choke on my breath.

At the right bottom corner of my bed, there’s a dark outline of a head. 

My eyes haven’t adjusted and I desperately want to rub them, hoping that would help them adjust, but I was frozen. It was the middle of summer, the nights never went below 75, but I couldn’t stop shaking. I couldn’t take my eyes off of the thing that stared back.

The breathing sound was the same pace as when I first heard it, in, out, in, out. 

After what felt like a lifetime, I forced my rigid arm to grab my phone. I missed the nightstand a number of times before I found it, refusing to look away from the head. After finally grabbing it, I quickly turned on the flashlight and shined it on the bed’s corner.

Nothing. 

I hastily shined the light all around my room, hoping that the head was somewhere to be seen. The more I found nothing, the more frantic I became shining my light around the room. Hyperventilating.

I couldn’t find it. 

Immediately I stopped.

Was that even real or did I imagine it?, I thought to myself.

That alone brought me down from my frantic state and I was almost back to breathing normally.
After doing one final shine at the spot where the head was and a final sweep around the room. I had to conclude that it was all my imagination.

“Thank god”, I breathed out as the crushing weight of terror left my body. I reluctantly turned off my phone’s light and put it back on the nightstand. 

Laying my body back down, I still felt a tingling of fear from what I’d saw. Deciding I’d rather see nothing than anything if I woke up again, I brought my head under the covers and tucked the blanket’s opening under my head. Turning my whole body away from where I saw the head, now I could be somewhat comfortable.

Finally, I was able to close my eyes and attempt to drift back to sleep.

That was until I heard the breathing again, louder than before—closer than before. 

I felt it. 
I FELT IT..

The hot, raspy breathing hitting the back of my neck. All I could do while frozen in terror, was whimper.
