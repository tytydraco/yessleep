📍 Original Post:

I know this is going to sound like nonsense, but please — someone confirm that I'm not completely alone in this.

My name's Grace, I'm 27 years old, I live in Newark, New Jersey, and to this day, I can't be in the same room as a radio without feeling nauseous.

When I was a kid, my grandfather had a giant brown radio that he called "my window to the world."

He would listen to games, the news... but sometimes at night, when I woke up to go to the bathroom, I'd find him sitting there, completely silent, listening to only static. And crying.

He never talked about it. Never.

Until he died in 2001.

Two weeks later, my grandmother gave me the radio, telling me to “keep listening to his world.”
I took the radio to my room. A dimly lit room with peeling blue wallpaper, where the only sound was the creaking of old wood.

The first time I tuned into 56.6 FM was on a Sunday night.
And that damn thing should NEVER exist.

It was a man's voice, halting, as if he'd just come out of a coma, saying:

“You're listening to… the frequency of the end.”
“There are no announcements here. There is no going back.”
“Here, your life ends before the sound.”

After that, there was a silence of seven seconds (I counted).

Then came the most bizarre thing I've ever heard: a sound of bones cracking, like fingers being broken inside a microphone.

And then…
A woman started screaming.
Not like in a movie.
It was real. It was a pure, primal scream, like someone was being skinned alive.

I shit myself. I turned off the radio and threw it under the bed.

But it turned back on.

Alone.

Volume turned up to full volume.

The woman was crying. Crying and repeating:

"It's not me. It's not me. It's not me."

After that, I couldn't sleep well for weeks.

Until the day the voice came back. But this time... it said my name.

"Grace Reynolds. Born at 6:44 p.m. Almost died at 9."

I NEVER told anyone this. Not even my family. But when I was 9, I choked on a piece of apple and passed out for 12 seconds.

HOW the fuck did that fucking thing know that?

And then, the radio uttered a new line:

"Your grandfather still listens. He's on the channel now. He wants to see you."

Grace, for God's sake, this is giving me the creeps.

I'm from Detroit and had a similar experience. I was doing fieldwork with old receivers at the university, messing with low-frequency waves, and I managed to tune in to 56.6 for a minute.

What I heard:
A baby crying.
But it was the other way around.
Like a baby being sucked back into the womb.

Then I heard three knocks. And breathing behind me.

I haven't been able to use radios since.
There's something on that frequency that shouldn't be there.

There's something waiting.

This isn't ordinary radio.
This is dimensional gap.

One of my army buddies (at Fort Lewis base) told me about a station that could only be heard at certain latitudes, at certain times, in complete solitude.

He called it "The Voice Between Worlds."

And he said that if you listen to the entire broadcast, you'll never come back the same.

Two months later, he disappeared during a simple patrol mission. He was never found.
They only found his radio.
Tuned in.
56.6.

Update.

I was recording the frequency's sound tonight, trying to show it to a friend. I recorded it on my cell phone.

When I went to transfer it to my computer, the file was 56 seconds long.

And it wasn't the original audio.

It was a recording of myself… sleeping.

And in the background, a voice whispered:

"She'll bleed out next Saturday."

Saturday is the anniversary of my grandfather's death.

I'll be gone for a few days. If I don't post by Tuesday, consider this my last message.
