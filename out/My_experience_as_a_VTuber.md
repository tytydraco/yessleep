“Real” doesn’t mean a lot these days, I know, but right now I need to hold onto whatever I can, whether it’s real or not.



People should learn that my career path isn’t sunshine and rainbows made of money. I wouldn’t wish the stress of this job on my worst enemy, but it won’t be long before I’m not even able to say *that* much. 



In just a few days every aspect of my life is going to be under scrutiny from a corporation. Every part of my day is going to be carefully monitored, recorded, then projected around the world. My beautifully animated avatar that the company spent around $10,000 to make will speak with a voice that sounds nothing like my own. My private life and my public life will be interchangeable forever. I’m not saying that to get pity or sympathy, but rather just to emphasize how dangerous this job can be if you’re even lucky enough to make money from it. Even as I write this and the clonazepam kicks in, I’m not sure of how much I want to tell of my own experience outside of the reason you’re seeing this post on this specific subreddit. From my perspective it’s the most horrifying moment of my life, but on the internet it’s barely even a bad day.

 

More than anything, I guess, I’ll just be honest with you. That's all I have. Just in case anyone out there can spread this and learn from my own experience.



The sad truth is that stalkers and creeps are just another occupational hazard of even being under any kind of social spotlight. That being said, I’ve put out so little on my main channel about my personal life that I don’t mind giving just a little run down on my life as a VTuber. 



It started a week after I began attending the community college I’d quickly drop out of. Along with deleting every email I’ve ever had, the company I’m signing on with has done a very good job of erasing my presence from the internet. Even if there had been a way to track me down? There isn’t one now.



The first question I’m going to be asked, a question I’ve always asked myself, is if I did it for the money.



The answer, the honest one, is yes. Back in the late 10’s VTubers were starting to go viral on YouTube. In no time, clips stolen from their channels were circulating with millions of views. I liked the idea of being a faceless personality. I’d spent most of my life watching and writing about the stuff you used to get stuffed in a locker for liking. Plus my voice was cute enough, why not try and use it?



When I told my roommates (Camilla and Aspen) my idea, very nervous and sure they were going to shut me down, they didn’t care at all. In fact they said they’d support me no matter what and that it was a good idea to hop on the gravy train before it took off. 



That night we sat in our living room and talked. The kitchen light was dim and cast shadows onto the blankets we’d draped up against the windows. The air was clogged with the haze of incense smoke and vapor from the dab pen we passed around.  After I’d told them my battle plan, they liked the idea so much that they wanted to try it with me. They weren’t as into anime or games as I was, but they were theater majors with dreams of making it big. It didn't matter if the stage was virtual, any stage was good enough.



We got our practice by making YouTube channels with shitty little avatars of our real selves playing games with each other. We didn’t  get more than a hundred views per video. It was still the most fun I’ve had in this “career.” 



Neither of my roommates have reached out in the years since I was signed on to a company. Maybe their messages were drowned out by the hundreds that are shoved in my inbox every day. My biggest fear for a while was that they were behind what’s happened to me. Camilla was never that toxic, but Aspen? 



Yeah, I can see her being jealous enough to make me jump at shadows. Let alone ruin my life. 



Out of the three of us, Aspen was the one that wanted to break out the most, and through any means necessary. And on the internet, especially to a barely-legal teen (as she advertised herself,) there was definitely a way to get popular fast. Before long she even had a facebook page for her strip show. Y’know, the ones you used to see in all the porn ads back in the day. 



I’ve always felt glad that I didn’t go the route she did. Every week me and Camilla could hear her gagging on dildos and playing up orgasms to a crowd that threw money at her. Both her and her audience ignored the way Aspen’s avatar looked ever-so-slightly disgusted at what she was forcing herself to do whenever she forgot to put a specific face on.



A few of her donors said they were going to find where she lived and “take her on an amazing date,” or some variation of that. Aspen bought a gun soon after, the rules of our lease be damned. That was the first time I felt like we could be watched. Not that someone *was*, but at the time it almost would’ve been better to rip that band aid off and just confirm it was happening. 



No, *feeling* like you’re being watched in your daily life is so much worse. Every time I went to class or went shopping at any store, the image of some creep changing the pitch of my model’s voice changer to find my voice, then find *me,* had me looking over my shoulder constantly. Every glance from someone on the street was a potential creep. But I put up with it, because the money was good.



Even mild success on the internet can change your life. It’s the gamble dozens of people make every day when they create a new social media or YouTube channel. Me and my roommates' bets paid off. We moved out of the dorms and into a pretty nice city apartment. The rooms were even spread out enough so that I didn’t have to hear Aspen’s constant gagging or Camilla’s nervous breakdowns.



She wasn’t having them for no reason either. Despite being the least popular of us with only a few hundred constant viewers, she was the first to have fan mail. Only it was sent to an apartment nobody should even know exists.



**Love you lots, keep doing your best!**



The letter was covered in hearts, smiley faces, and drawings of Camilla’s avatar. All of this would have been okay if our address, not our PO box, was printed on top left of the envelope.



We moved. As fast as we could, as quietly as we could, we found an even better apartment that me and Aspen mostly paid for out of pity for Camilla.



A week later an envelope was taped to the front door.



**Sorry! I’ll leave you alone, I won’t bother you, keep doing your best! I’m not a stalker, I swear, just your biggest fan. Love you lots!**



Camilla went to the post office and, through a year’s worth of legal trouble and moving heaven and Earth to see justice done, found and got a restraining order on the not-stalker. A week later he hung himself in his closet, but by then Camilla was jaded and on enough medications to handle the situation as well as she could: Doing monetized streams and videos warning other VTubers and their communities of what *not* to do. She made a lot of money. Even more after she made her face public and started dedicated social media to her “real” self. 



Me and Aspen had long moved out by that point. She’s been doing pretty good. She does regular streams where her fancy 3D model quivers and thrusts against something-or-other with horrible tracking and no expression. She makes thousands of dollars every week. Forget a button that shoots dopamine in your system, why not a button that makes a girl moan for the low price of ten dollars?



Then came an agent. Then a manager, then public events and collaborations and a circus that has me as the centerpiece. Or, rather, my human corpse stapled to my avatar. And all of the other girls in these collabs dance, sing, and play into the jokes of their respective chats. Behind all of the hefty breasts and exposed midriffs, though, are girls in empty apartments with cumbersome tracking equipment weighing them down. 



Our avatars wore revealing exercise clothes the last time this happened. We all made sure the cameras were pointed at the right angles and, as always, told our audience that we loved them with a virtual wink before we all signed off and were left standing, alone, in our empty apartments. Or maybe in their case, massive, expensive houses.



I’d assumed the letter I got a week or two ago came from her. Maybe even Camilla. They both resented me for being the first to sign on to the first English-speaking big-shot corporation emerging out of the VTube space. Funny thing about those companies, despite the tens of thousands of donations you get on stream, they almost never implement a donation limit. I didn’t have one, and never will, but it was always something you’d see some incel post about on Reddit. I’d actually just got done doing an anonymous dive into my own reddit when I thought I heard someone knock on my apartment door.



There was a pink envelope taped to my door, long after I’d quit using a PO box and *long* after I’d stopped giving any sort of clue who I could be.



**So proud of you! Been there since the beginning, love you!**



It was typed, not handwritten like Camilla’s letter had been. There weren’t any smiley faces or drawings of my avatar either.



I’ve only left my apartment once since getting that letter, after I’d run out of anything to eat. My apartment was my universe. I log into my desktop, edit videos for five hours, eat whatever food I ordered, and continue to edit or do my show for five hours, then sleep.



Walks to the gas station used to be part of that routine. So did daily showers and phone calls with my mom.



Anything outside of that is just screens and sleep. The few times I could hear my slippers slapping against concrete and hear the noise of the city were a treasure. I miss them. The last one I took was what really made me want to write and post this.



I hadn’t showered, shaved, or flossed in a week. But I wanted, *needed,* to get out of my apartment. Ignore your human instinct all you want, but eventually your impulses win. By then I was eating a few gummies any time I drew the shades open, so I got pretty fucked up before my last trip to the gas station. 



“Have a good day! Love you!”



It’s a fact that the cashier *didn’t* say this to me on the way out. I heard it anyway. As clear as the sound of my fingers hammering into this keyboard, I heard someone at the back of the store say those words. Maybe someone else did. At the time it was a lot easier to say I was having an episode and to get home as fast as I could.



So I ran back, the whole thing a mess of kaleidoscope eyes and idiot brain that I don’t remember at all.



The dull *thunk* of my doorknob refusing to turn snapped me back into focus.



*Oh shit.*

*Oh SHIT!*



My e-card came out of my wallet, which I just pressed to the door and usually worked fine, and I swiped it across the reader again. The light above the knob flashed red. I swiped it again.



And again.



And again.



I was crying when I finally let go of the doorknob. Drinks and food spilled out of the bags and we collapsed to the floor together. My sleeves were covered in snot and tears. Nobody had come out of their apartments to see what the commotion was.



All I could think to do was find someplace to sit and… I don’t know. Just sit. Nobody was in the complex’s lobby so I picked the closest faux-leather chair and sat. A few more tears came out but mostly I sat still, watching the cheap books on the cheap coffee table swirl in front of the unlit fireplace. But, for just a second, I was able to relax and look at the world as if it were a blurry painting that occasionally shifted colors. I could just sit still and wait for something to wake me up.



The elevator, stairwell, and front doors to the lobby were really loud. But I didn’t hear her open any of them. I blinked.



 There she was, sitting next to me.



She looked exactly like my avatar had in the early days.



Black hair, olive skin just a few shades darker than mine, and a white dress. More distinguishing features came later to make more of an attempt to stand out.



For a second she was really there. Then I felt something held against my ear, and she was speaking with my manager’s voice.



“I’ll be over in an hour. I’m so excited for you XXXXX.”



A *hisssssss* came from behind me. One of the complex’s staff was making a cup of coffee and more than a little had dropped and sizzled on the heating pad. I hadn’t noticed her come in either.



“I feel like I’m freaking out,” I said with a flat voice. The world in front of me was still swirling and I could hardly focus. “I swear there’s a stalker. You saw how similar the letter was to Camilla’s.”



A homeless man came into the lobby and warmed himself by the fireplace. The sight was a dark, grey, oceanic wave in my vision that seemed all at once scary *and* calming. No doubt my oversized t-shirt with a faded mouse and matching pajama bottoms made me look homeless myself.



“We’re already taking care of that with your apartment’s staff, I’ve reminded you a dozen times now. They’re just trying to identify him with the other buildings in your area. We’ll have a warrant for his arrest in no time.”



“But I feel so… watched.”



“You’re going to get that feeling every now and then, there’s no helping it. You’re a public figure, even if only a handful of your fans can even *guess* your identity.”



With some effort I made myself sound like I was reluctantly agreeing with her.



“Just take a deep breath,” she said through my avatar. Her voice sounded like mine now. “Take your medicine. It’ll be okay. We’ll talk about it when I get there. Love you lots.”



She was gone. The lobby was empty.



Nobody had touched my little pile of groceries by the time I made it back to my apartment. A bottle of diet soda helped wash down more of my panic attack medication.



“Excuse me?” Someone said from behind me.



The soda and medication going down hit a wall of air from my lungs trying to come out as a scream. When I turned around, I would swear that the guy was the same one that worked at the gas station I went to for quick food.



“I’m so sorry!” He said, backing away and putting his hands up to prove he wasn’t a threat. The hallway behind him was a mirage of brown and beige that undulated, forcing me to hold onto my doorknob to keep my balance. Vomit curled up into my already clogged throat.



With a reflex I’d developed for doing my online show, I smiled. It was the perfect mask for my avatar if I happened to feel any genuine sadness or anger. For everything pre-planned, I had many emotions programmed to certain buttons on my software.



“I’m so sorry,” the guy said again. He was almost shaking. “I live down the hallway. I just wanted to let you know that someone’s been watching you the last few times you were at my work, the, uh, gas station down the street. I thought you’d… Want to know?”



The asshole didn’t even give me the dignity of saying anything back. Just scampered off down the hall into one of the apartments.



“Thanks, I appreciate it,” I said to nothing.



That was okay. Is okay.



My e-key worked when I tried it again. My groceries went into the fridge and I went into the shower with a forty and my dab pen. I came out feeling calmer and ready to stream. I don’t know what was in that pen, but it gave me the most vivid experience with my show. I’m feeling a kind of callback high even writing about it.



My room looked like my avatar’s virtual one. Honey combs and golden hexagonal decorations of all kinds that dripped with thick syrupy liquid from a new “bee” theme I was trying out. The avatar on my screen was a short, pudgy girl with acne scars. The same girl that had accidentally appeared in a big streamers video once and was only noticed as a “butterface” in the chat. When I went live, none of my audience seemed to notice me and my avatar had switched places, so I kept the show going as usual.



In the middle of my show, during the easiest bit where I watch playlists of other people’s videos and react, I opened my window shutters to let some cool air in. Turning on my AC would have risked background noise that would have irritated enough of my audience enough to keep a few donations from coming. Right as the shutter went up, a donation came up on my screen.



*From someone special. Be yourself. Love you.*



My avatar and I froze. I should have expected this message to pop up on my feed, but it still made me numb with fear. I ran back to my desk to check the donation list, but it was gone. Nobody else in the chat had noticed it.



“Hey chat, I…”



I couldn’t find any words.



My room was my room again. Everything was normal. My avatar was in its place and I was in mine. The chat was flooded with jokes about my character being frozen. A few people were even concerned.



“Chat, I… I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry.



“I’m sorry for being me. For lying to all of you, even the ones that tell themselves that I’m just another talking head on the internet. For the last year my life has been spiraling and I can’t take it anymore, okay? I just want all this to stop. I don’t want to be looked at anymore, I don’t want to ask for money anymore, and I don’t want to be coy and friendly with any of you just to build a relationship that gets me retention. All I’ve done, all any of us have done, is sell you a lie.”



“I want to go home. I’m scared.”



My finger clicked on the “end stream” button. I deleted the recording of the stream, my subreddit, and any other socials I could find relating to the character I had been for years.



When I was done, I saw a stack of papers on my counter.



My new contract. All the papers were signed, everything was ready to go. My new life was going to start whether I liked it or not. So I called my mom.



Usually our calls were brief, she knew I was busy and I knew that I didn’t want to talk to her if I could help it. I don’t even remember much of the conversation, except that I did a lot of crying and she did a lot of reassuring.



“Oh, I forgot to ask, did you ever get the letters I sent you?” She asked.



“I don’t think so, what letters?”



“Really!? I made sure to leave them on your door! As a surprise! I even left a little donation thingy on your show today, I know it was your last one before you hit the big leagues.”



Whatever she said after that, I don’t remember. I don’t *want* to remember. I ended the call chuckling. I threw the phone against the wall in the middle of laughing fits. Then I was struggling to breath from laughing and sobbing as I destroyed all of the equipment I’d saved and worked so hard for. My sobs hitched in my throat while I washed the blood from my scratched fingers and knuckles in a shower that I sat in for an hour and a half. 



It doesn’t matter. In a week I’ll be in a big blue house with even fancier equipment.



What else could I ask for? What else do I deserve?



I guess you’ll see.



I won’t. In a week, I’ll be a distant memory, and I pray that the girl that is set to take my place can keep it together better than I could.
