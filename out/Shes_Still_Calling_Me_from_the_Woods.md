 When I was nine, I found the woods. 

Now, I know that doesn’t seem too impressive at first. 

The thing is, I think I was the only one who could see them.

I toddled over after church on Sunday, still wearing the pink bows in my hair and carefully skipping over any patch of earth that wasn’t covered in grass so I wouldn’t stain my Sunday shoes. 

There was a large field near where I lived that my mother deemed safe enough for me to play in with all the other neighborhood kids. It wasn’t a playground by any means, just a vast stretch of land that never sprouted anything worth picking. I was alone that Sunday, walking around the dead field until I could barely make out the wavering smudge of my house in the afternoon heat. 

I regret it now, but at the time, I decided to slip under the barbed wire fence and run off, hoping to find something pretty. I wanted a sunflower for my hair. 

That’s when I found the woods. I didn’t even realize there was anything out there; I lived in the last house on the block, and from there it just stemmed out into that empty field. No one ever mentioned the woods, not even the adults as a warning not to go in. 

Obviously, I went in.

The trees were black and gnarly, with thick knobs and protruding roots so overgrown, they reminded me of bony fingers with too many knuckles. Crisp leaves in all shades of brown littered the floor, and I loved the satisfying crackle underneath my Sunday shoes as I explored. 

Looking back, I don’t know what it was about the woods, but I was captivated. I was running through the trees, making tremendous leaps over streams, and just playing like the child I was. It felt like I was in another world when I looked up at the canopy of leaves and branches, sunlight glittering through the green. 

It felt like minutes, no more than an hour at most, before I noticed the sky was ripe and orange. The sun was setting already. 

I sucked on my teeth before sighing. Sundown meant going home. I made my way toward the direction I came in when a wispy breeze fluttered over my body, lifting the lace ends of my dress and sending my hair flying off my shoulders.

I shuddered, but kept walking. 

I made it home just as my mother stepped out on to the porch to yell for me. 

“Oh, there you are, Faith. Come insi—where is your bow? Little girl, I told you to change before you went playing in the field in your Sunday clothes!”

I reached into my hair and realized she was right, I was missing one of the ribbons meant to be tied around my plaits. 

“I wasn’t in the field, I—“

“Hush now, I don’t care for excuses. Go on inside and I’ll run your bath.” She tsked, shoving me inside with a rough hand on my back.

The next morning, I spoke to Jeremy at the bus stop. He was my neighbor.

“Jeremy, why haven’t you ever shown me the woods?” I asked.

“What woods?”

“The woods past the field. Don’t play stupid.”

“I ain’t playing stupid. I never seen no woods, and I lived here twice as long as you. You’re stupid.”

“I am not, Jeremy! The woods are over there,” I pointed past the field. “And I’ll prove it to you after school.”

“Fine, bighead, let’s see.”

The entire day I was antsy. Finally, we sat together on the bus ride home and I knew I would be proven right. 

We dumped our backpacks and lunchboxes on my porch and marched through the field. When we got to the fence, he hesitated.

“My momma says not to go past the fence because then she can’t see me.”

“Oh, you chicken, then?”

“Shut up,” he said. He looked back towards the neighborhood before rolling under the fence. I followed, ducking beneath the wire. 

I led the way, the same way as I had taken yesterday. 

Only this time, I couldn’t find the woods. We must have walked for ten minutes before Jeremy spoke.

“I don’t know why I believed you. You’re just a liar. I knew there wasn’t no woods.”

“There is too! You don’t know nothing.”

“Wasting my time for this… Loony, you are. I’m going home before my momma starts whining.” He turned around and I watched him until he went under the barbed wire fence again. 

Where were the woods? It didn’t make sense. 

I felt a cold wind wash over me, prickling at my skin. I rubbed at my arms and looked up.

My bow! 

It had become undone and was just a pink ribbon gliding through the air. I chased after it, but random bursts of wind kept it out of my reach. I spun in circles and scuffed my shoes and knees as I hurried, my eyes ignoring the ground.

It finally smacked against a tree, and I realized I was at the woods once again. I grabbed my ribbon and shoved it in my skirt pocket, distrustful eyes scanning my surroundings. I could still see the edge of the field, so I hadn’t gone far, but it didn’t make sense. Why weren’t the woods this easy to find with Jeremy? 

I raced inside anyway, gleefully crushing hard leaves under my feet. This time, I started kicking together piles of them in a path, jumping from stack to stack and relishing in the experience.

As I peered past the black trunks of the trees, I realized it was sunset. But that couldn’t be true, school had just ended half an hour ago. I hadn’t even had supper yet. 

I backed out of the woods and when I blinked, the sun was back up, shining down brightly on me. I went back inside, examining the stark difference in the sky. When I looked to the left, outside the woods and into the open, it was sunshine. When I looked to the right, into the depths of forest, the sun cascaded yellow and orange through the dark, black trunks, just like a sunset. 

I went back every day that week, and every day it was the same. It was always sunset in the woods, no matter if I went in the morning or afternoon. It was strange waking up on Saturday mornings and spending hours watching the sun frozen halfway down the horizon. 

After about a month of spending nearly every day in the woods, I heard a laugh. 

I think it was a laugh. 

The sound was a whisper in the air and I could feel it gusting around me. 

“Hello?” I called out.

Silence, just for a beat.

A round of giggles came from behind a nearby tree, but I couldn’t identify which one. It sounded like it was surrounding me. It was a guess, but I assumed it was little girl laughter. I had always wanted girl friends, so a spark of excitement shook through me.

“Hey, come on out!” 

She didn’t say anything, but I heard footsteps take off and I bolted after them.

There was no path of shoes in the dirt, no overturned leaves being kicked through, nothing but the faint ghost of a breathless laugh. 

“This isn’t funny,” I announced with a deep frown, clutching at my aching side. 

The laughter stopped immediately.

I sucked in a deep breath.

My shadow was dark, I noticed. Much darker than it had ever been in the woods. The usually orange sky was fading fast, cold navy overtaking warm citrus colors. 

“I’m going home,” I said. I don’t know why I did, I just had to let her know. “Play with me tomorrow.”

“Wait,” a girl’s voice. 

I spun in a circle, unceremoniously slipping on some of those crisp leaves. I couldn’t see her. 

“What?”

“Wanna see something neat?”

“Who are you,” I asked.

“A girl offering you something one last time. Wanna see something neat or not?” 

I stood up and patted my skirt, dusting the dirt off. 

“Show me.” 

A small hand waved from behind a particularly rotten tree. I grinned and chased after the figure, darkness enveloping any discernible features; she was only a shape running ahead of me. Her voice was youthful and she was no taller than me, and I was not a large child. 

We giggled in those little girl laughs as we went further and further in the deep thicket. The sunlight was nearly gone, I could barely make out my own feet as I chased after the girl.

“Where we going?”

“It’s a surprise.”

I groaned.

“Hush, we’re nearly there.”

I rolled my eyes, but obeyed. 

“What’s your name?”

“Nearly there now, Faith.”

I slowly stopped myself, fear ebbing its way into my chest for the first time. 

As if she felt my pause, she stood as still as the trees, unwavering in the growing winds. Her dress didn’t even flutter with the breeze like my skirt did.

“Why did you stop,” she asked in a strained voice. “Don’tcha wanna see? See the surprise?”

I took a step back, nearly fumbling over a thick root. 

“My mother must want me home by now.”

“No, she doesn’t.”

“You don’t know my mother.” 

“Oh,” she sighed, her head dipping forward, long hair covering her face. “I know a lot more than you, Faith.” 

She started laughing as she turned to face me, the soft sound morphing into an unrecognizable cackle. 

It was so dark now, I couldn’t see much else but her. Her skin almost glittered, but there wasn’t any moonlight. 

“How do you know my name?”

“You told me. You don’t remember?”

I shook my head, and though she wasn’t looking at me, somehow she saw it. 

“Faith Brown. You have a bad memory. I told you I know more than you.”

The whistle of sharp gusts of air pierced my ears, her voice barely floating through the sound. My hands were sticky, cold and sticky. 

“What’s your name? You know mine.” I asked again.

“You should go on home. Your mommy is really scared right now.” She said it so matter-of-factly, faint but sure. 

I hated her voice, I wanted to hit her. I wanted to reach my fists into her long, ugly hair and pull it out of her face so I could spit in it. Never in my life had I ever felt so much vile, abysmal hatred for someone. It frightened me. Most of my thoughts were on my mother, though, so I didn’t pause to reflect on these realizations for too long. 

I took off running in the opposite direction, praying I was heading the right way. I was sprinting like the fastest horse on the track, but somehow her laughter was right on my shoulder, cawing loudly inside my brain. 

“Bye bye, Faith! Let’s play tomorrow.”

Again, I felt that prickling feeling of disdain. I nearly turned around and chased after her again, just to pummel her. 

Instead, I focused on how the clearing was approaching. I ducked my head and let out a shaky breath of relief when I found myself out in the open. 

Slowly, tentatively, I peered back at the woods, fully expecting to see her standing there. 

It was so dark, I couldn’t see past the first couple of trees. They guarded the entrance, standing like ghouls with long, grotesque branches like bony fingers outstretched to me. 

The walk back to the field was brisk; I was on edge, a growing knot weighing in my stomach that I wouldn’t make it home. 

I had never been out so late. There wasn’t a cloud above to block moonlight, but even then, the moon was absent. I had no guide home, so I continued to trek in blackness, hoping I would see the streetlights soon. 

I wondered if I would see her again—

A crushing grip yanked my shoulder, spinning me around and sending dirt flying as my shoes scraped the ground. 

Large, strong hands shook me, and a white light blinded me. I was gone, I was dying in that moment, my soul fled my body. 

“Calm down! I need you to stop screaming, honey. Stop, tell me your name.”

I heard a click and the light was much dimmer. I hadn’t realized I screamed at all. 

My eyes adjusted, and I noticed the golden glitter of a badge. 

“Faith Brown.”

He sighed, genuine relief in the motion. 

“Let’s get you home, sweetheart.”

The night passed in a blur. I was holding his hand as we walked through the field. He said several things into the machine on his chest. My street was flashing with red and blue. My mom was smoking a cigarette on the porch. She shouted at me, but I didn’t hear a word until her icy fingers were digging into my arms, clutching me tight against her. 

I slept in her bed that night, I think. I didn’t go to school that next Monday. I don’t think I went at all that week. 

The next time I felt conscious, grounded back in reality, was when I accidentally pushed the glass of lemonade off the table. Shards went skittering across the kitchen floor, bouncing until they hit the walls. 

“Faith!”

“Sorry, mother!” I bent down to start picking up the pieces when my mother grabbed my wrist. 

“You dense little girl, don’t touch glass!” She hissed at me before her eyes softened. “Baby girl, it’s dangerous. I’ll clean it up, you — carefully — throw the bag outside. Can you do that?” 

I nodded absently. 

When my mother wrapped the glass in a towel and secured it in a waste bag, she sent me to the trash cans outside. They were in the backyard. 

I hopped down the steps, the feeling of being out of the house already foreign. A breeze nearly made me jump. 

Despite the wind being negligible, one of the bins tipped over. 

A single brown leaf fell out, gliding through the air and landing right before my feet. 

I don’t know how I knew, but it was obvious to me that this lead was from the woods. It fluttered at the ground a bit, the crisp corners pointing past the field, wanting me to follow. It was enticing me, urging me to just obey. I felt a strange pull in my chest, a physical tug that made my shoes scrape against the dirt and inch towards those cursed woods. 

I stomped on the leaf, my teeth grinding together as I used my heel to shred it to pieces. 

For a while, things seemed to be getting better. The wind didn’t call to me and I stopped having nightmares featuring a black and white figure. The girl. Jeremy even told the older boys to stop teasing me about it all.

I thought it was over. 

A month had passed, maybe two. Church had finished and all us neighborhood kids were playing tag in the field. Maybe it was all the others there that made me feel safe enough to go with them.

An older girl from the middle school was it, and I scurried away from her, but I tripped on a long, pointed stick. I skidded to the dirt without an ounce of grace, dust and pebbles digging into my clothes and skin. I picked up the wooden branch and waved it around. 

It was like a magnet, zeroing in on one specific direction: directly to the woods. Again, I felt that tug in my bones, my mind blank as I was almost roped in. It felt like my feet weren’t even leaving the ground, just that some unexplainable force was luring me in. 

None of the other kids saw me. Or they did and didn’t care. I would rather believe the former. 

I blinked. 

I was back. I was in there, alone, and the sun was setting fast behind me. Dread coursed through me and I spun around, my grip taut on the stick in my hands. I clutched it to my chest, my heartbeat rising rapidly. 

It was getting so dark so fast. It felt as if the blacker it got, the harder it was to breathe. Everything was so, *so* loud; my ears pounded, my shaky exhales were crashing waves, the rustling trees were windstorms. 

The song was excruciating. 

I strained my body to focus. The song—this ominous chanting that suddenly began, a crooning chorus of voices was somehow the faintest trace of sound and the most excruciatingly powerful racket possible. 

I couldn’t describe it accurately if I tried. The most I could say was that it reminded me of the choir at church, but the emotions it evoked were polar opposites. There was no unified comfort, but an unrelenting hymn, slow and mournful. 

With nimble steps, I inched away from the anthem, fearful of the voices stopping at hearing my footsteps. 

Bright red lights exploded like fireworks.

I saw them all.

Vaguely, but undeniable. A hoard of people, all just as ghastly white as the first girl, their sinful song louder and closer. Their faces were hidden being long strands of hideous black hair. They all looked the same, a crowd of the same kin. 

She stood at the front, closer than all the rest. 

The burning in my throat was agonizing, bile threatening to spill out as she lifted her head. Her face, the blankest white I had ever seen, was empty save for two black holes where her eyes should have been, and a carnivorous mouth lined with rows and rows of almost-humanlike teeth. 

Her face was flat, no curves or features anywhere but those haunting eyes. They were like craters, dark and empty. Still, I knew they were boring into my soul. 

I was petrified. I wanted to run off as fast as I could. I couldn’t do it backwards, but I simply couldn’t look away from the swaying mass of people in front of me. I couldn’t imagine what they would do if I turned around. 

I didn’t have time to make a choice on what to do next because she launched into action. She moved like a newborn animal, gangly yet purposeful, and she was heading straight for me. 

She couldn’t catch me. That was all I knew. 

I bolted, adrenaline carrying me with a strength I’d never have again. I was practically flying through the trees.

They were alive, leaning in and closing the gaps, making it harder for me to dart between them. Their branches scratched and nipped at my face and arms, but I could barely feel it. 

“Faith, we need you at the communion!” She screeched behind me, dangerously close. 

Her voice was loud, but the song from the crowd was fading. I was getting close to freedom and she knew it. 

I heard her pounce and then I was slammed to the ground. Her body was light, but cold enough that where her hands touched me, the skin felt like I was soaking in an ice bath. 

I couldn’t breathe, my lungs throbbing inside me. I was beyond afraid, my body acting in autopilot because my mind was mush. 

I screamed, a deep, guttural shriek that surprised her. With a swift movement, I stabbed the wooden branch I still held into one of the black craters on her face and she fell back, hissing and howling like a feral creature. 

I used the brief moment of distraction to shove the stake in deeper and run. I ran with all my might, the steady pounding in my ears protecting me from whatever curses she screamed after me.

My vision was going dark at the edges, my chest aflame with pricking pain building inside me. I was going down and I knew it, but I could see it then: the edge. With a final burst of speed, I catapulted myself out of the woods and as far as I could get.

I collapsed in the field.

Sometime later, my mother was shaking me to consciousness. I couldn’t move, but I bawled in her arms, scrapes and scratches riddling my body. When they changed me at the hospital, there were deep claw marks on my back. 

Within two weeks, we moved. I lost a lot of my childhood. Outside of this period, I can only remember bits and pieces of what should have been joyful times. It took a long time for me to feel safe. 

And I did. For a good while, I felt safe. I didn’t think of her or anything that happened for many years, the only reminder my scars on my back and the occasional flash of nightmares.

I was okay.

Until this morning. 

My daughter, my darling little girl who gave me hope and a warm feeling of peace just by being near her, was coloring beside me as I finished something on my laptop. 

I glanced down to her page and was nine years old again, looking right into the black abyss of two soul-sucking eyes above a sharp, dripping mouth.

“Baby,” I croaked, “baby, who is that?”

“Oh,” my daughter hummed. So blissfully unaware. “She’s a girl I met in the forest yesterday.”

I could feel every painstakingly difficult year of therapy slipping away from me. With a trembling hand, I ripped the page out of her notebook and crumbled it, ignoring her cries of protest.

We live nowhere near a forest. I can hear that song again.
