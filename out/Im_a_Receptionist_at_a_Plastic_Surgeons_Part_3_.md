Having Wilson with us stopped more of the patients from trying to kill me every time they didn’t get what they wanted. But I felt as if I was constantly walking on eggshells around him. He’s so cheery and friendly towards me and Rachel that I sometimes forget about what he is. But sometimes when it gets a little too hot in the office I notice that he starts to melt a bit. It was my idea to keep the waiting room at a cool 50 degrees to stop him from melting. The patients might complain a bit, but honestly, as long as it keeps Wilson from turning into a goop monster again, I’m all for it. 



I came into work the other day dressed in a cozy sweater so that I didn’t catch a cold in our freezing waiting room. I smiled and waved at Wilson when I opened the door to the waiting room and saw him standing dutifully at his post. His cheer is infectious at times, and I can’t help but smile back at him. He doesn’t seem ever to leave the waiting room, so I have to imagine that he just stands at his post the entire night. Props to him for his dedication! 



Sitting down at my desk I noticed that I had much less paperwork than normal. Pulling up the schedule for today I was surprised to see that only four patients were planned for today. I’ve worked here for almost an entire year and I’ve never seen Dr. Harrison have less than fifteen patients minimum. My first assumption was that it must have been some sort of mistake and that maybe my calendar was wrong. 



“Hey, lardass,” I turned over to see Rachel standing at my desk with her arms crossed and her usual bitchy expression staring at me. “Anything wrong with Wilson today?” she asked me as she tapped her finger impatiently against her arm. I looked over at Wilson, who had heard his name and was looking back over at us. 



“Besides never leaving that post? Nah he’s fine.” I told her. I wanted to talk shit to her but my curiosity took precedence over my pettiness. “Why does Dr. Harrison only have four patients today?” I asked her. She looked at me with surprise and then I showed her the schedule for today. 



“Oh, that’s today?” she asked as she yanked the sheet of paper away from me to examine it. “It’s nothing you should concern yourself with. These are just real important patients that need his full attention.” She tossed the schedule back at me and walked away, leaving me in a huff and with an itch of curiosity. So I decided to wait for him. It was another rare moment of him being late again, so I was worried something had happened to him. 



Dr. Harrison arrived close to opening time, and it was obvious to me that he wasn’t holding up so well. Ever since having to call whoever that old rotary phone was connected to, he had been in a deep depression. He approached my desk and gave me a half-hearted smile, but I could tell that he was still upset. The look in his eyes was enough to show me that. His beautiful green eyes didn’t have the shine that they once had. 



“Hey, doc. Can I get you anything to cheer you up?” I asked him, worried that he might mess up a surgery in his current state. He looked at me and shook his head before staring down at the schedule laid before him. 



“That’s today, huh?” He sighed and pushed his glasses up to rub the bridge of his nose. “Do me a favor, Maggie.” He started telling me, placing his glasses back into place. “The third patient that’s going to show up today, do your best not to interact with him too much. He can be, a little much.” He told me, grabbing the papers I handed him and making his way back into the back hallways toward the ORs and consultation rooms. 



I let out a sigh as I started working on my few pieces of paperwork. When the doors opened, I was surprised to see that a flood of patients didn’t come rushing in as they normally did. I looked over at Wilson to see if he was as confused as I was, but the blank look on his face with a smile on his face proved to me that he probably wasn’t thinking about much. I wheeled my chair over to the computer and decided to check something. A quick search showed me why there wasn’t anybody showing up today. Our clinic showed up as closed. 



It was probably the easiest day of work I’ve had since I started working here. To the point that I was even able to start reading a book, I had brought on my first day of work, thinking that I would actually have time to read it. Of course though, the moment I turned the first page the front door opened and I heard long heels clicking against our floors. I let out an annoyed exhale as I looked up from my book and quickly dropped it to the floor. 



In all my time working here, I’ve seen some people who are clearly addicted to plastic surgery. The kind that you immediately think of when you think of the phrase botched surgery. But this woman was the poster child of botched surgery. Her skin was pulled tight against her skull and was so thin that I thought any little cut to her skin would cause it to snap off her skull. Not to mention she looked like her face was made completely of plastic. 



“I have arrived,” she said, with all the superiority that someone like she imagined herself to have. “Oh God, has Dr. Harrison gotten desperate enough to hire pigs as his receptionist?” She scoffed when she laid eyes on me. I had to physically bite my tongue to stop myself from saying anything to her back. 



“Hello, ma’am. Dr. Harrison should be all ready for you, so you can go right ahead!” I told her in my best customer service voice, all the while scratching at my hand to stop it from wanting to punch her right in her stupid plastic face. She snuffed and walked towards the door that led to the rooms. Once she had finally left my sight and I heard the clicking of her heels retreat into one of the nearby rooms I let out a long and annoyed sigh and picked my book up from the floor. It immediately returned to the floor when I looked up and saw yet another patient waiting for me. He was just as plastic looking as the woman was. Lucky for me he wasn’t as big of an asshole as the woman had been. In fact, he was perfectly silent. 



“You can go right ahead, sir. Dr. Harrison should be with you shortly.” I told him. He nodded at me and started walking. It seemed like he could barely move his body, it looked like he was a living action figure with how he was moving. I watched him and shook my head, starting to question why I had decided to stay here. 



I gave up on reading the book and instead decided to just double-check all the paperwork I had done that day. Which took only a few minutes, and I found myself missing the endless rush of patients. Of course not the crazies but for them I had Wilson standing nearby. This time I was able to see the next patient enter the waiting room. He wasn’t like the previous two who had dressed like they were about to have a photo shoot afterward. 



He was dressed in a dirty hoodie and sweatpants, a face mask covering the lower part of his face, and his hands were planted firmly in his hoodie pockets. He approached the desk and stared at me with cold brown eyes, that just seemed hollow. Like there was no life behind them at all. I thought for a moment that maybe he was some junkie who was planning to rob the clinic or something, but with Wilson close at hand I held off any accusations. 



“Hello, sir. Do you have an appointment today?” I asked him, mostly for verification. He stared at me with those hollow eyes and I began to get uncomfortable with just how intently he was staring at me. I reached under my desk to get my pepper spray, but as I did he cleared his throat. 



“Yea. It’s under Spencer,” he told me. Even his voice gave me uncanny feelings. It sounded like the recording of a voice. I wondered if that was his last name or first. I looked over at my monitor and was surprised to see an appointment just under the name Spencer. That was it. I clicked on his name to see if he had insurance or anything at all like that. There was nothing under his name, just his name, and that he had an appointment at this time. 



“Yea…” I said as I took a look at him. While he was wearing a hoodie, his hood wasn’t up and he had a tangled mass of brown hair on his head. I drummed my fingers on the table as I kept looking at his sparse records. Should I just let him through, I thought to myself. I decided I needed confirmation before I was going to allow him into the clinic. “Can you just have a seat? I just need to have a quick word with Dr. Harrison. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes.” I said, giving him the best fake smile I could. 



He stared at me for a couple of seconds before looking over at the row of seats available to him. “Don’t take too long.” He told me as he turned and walked over to a nearby seat. I nodded at him and quickly stood up from my chair, and glanced over at Wilson. He had his eyes securely trained on Spencer and I was assured enough to go and ask Dr. Harrison. Walking over to the first OR room I didn’t hear any sounds coming from inside, so I knocked before just barging in unannounced. 



“Dr. Harrison? I need to ask you something.” I told him through the door as I backed up enough to let the door swing open. It took a few moments, enough time elapsed to where I thought he hadn’t heard me. But just as I was about to knock again, the door slowly opened and Rachel stuck her head out. 



“What do you want, fatass? We’re in the middle of surgery.” She scolded me from behind her face mask. I sighed and brushed past her annoying comment. 



“That Spencer guy is here. And I wanted to know if I should admit him. He seems really sketchy.” I told her, glancing back toward my desk just to make sure he wasn’t spying on me or anything. Rachel rolled her eyes at me and pulled her mask down. 



“That’s what you’re interrupting us for? Yes, let that asshole in. And don’t let him touch any of the equipment.” Before I could ask any other follow-up question the door was slammed in my face. 



“Dumb bitch,” I hissed at her and turned to return to my desk. I took a quick seat and made sure that Wilson hadn’t torn Spencer to shreds. Seeing that he was still sitting where he was I motioned for him to come up to the desk. Hands still in his hoodie pocket he stood up from his seat and walked over to me. “You can go right ahead, sir. Dr. Harrison did ask for you not to touch any of our equipment.” I told him, ignoring the fact that Rachel had told me that. 



“Yeah, yeah, as long as he fixes me,” Spencer said as he walked over to the door and entered into the hallway towards the OR. Leaning back in my chair I looked over at the clock and groaned when I realized that only an hour and a half had passed since we opened. Just as I was about to try reading that book again I heard a loud snap coming from the lost and found box.



“Gotcha!” I shouted triumphantly as I quickly wheeled over to inspect the mouse trap I had left inside the lost and found. I figured that maybe a rat or mouse had been getting into the box and stealing things to make a nest or something out of it. I peeked into the box and was immediately surprised to see that nothing had been caught. The trap hadn’t gone off accidentally though, as the cheese I had used as bait had been stolen. “Smart mouse…” I hissed, making a mental note to get more traps on my way home from work. 



As I was contemplating ways to catch this mystery creature that was stealing from the lost and found a loud screech ripped through the entire clinic. Followed quickly afterward by Rachel’s screaming. Standing up quickly from my chair I looked over at Wilson who had also looked on in confusion over what was going on. He quickly left his post and entered the door towards the hallway. I followed after him, making my way to the back of the receptionist area that led into the same hallway. 



Wilson was trying to enter the OR where Dr. Harrison and Rachel were, but the door was locked. He looked slightly confused like he’d never come across a situation like this before. Before he could figure out how to open the door, it flew off its hinges and set him flying into the wall, a sickening crunch and splat sounded out as Wilson was splattered against the wall like a mosquito. 



Quickly afterward, Rachel came sprinting out of the room and towards me, not even insulting me as she grabbed me by the arm and started running with me in tow. This so took me aback that I didn’t even know what we were running from. But I heard loud screeching behind us, and I ventured a look behind us to see what it was. And was immediately regretful that I did. Chasing after us was the upper torso of the woman. Her spinal cord had turned into a long tail and her ribs were serving as legs propelling her along with her elongated arms. 



“What the fuck is that?!” I screamed at Rachel as we rushed into the nearby OR room and quickly slammed the door behind us. We both pressed ourselves against the door to stop the monster from getting through the door. It slammed itself against the door and broke the top hinge, but failed to bust down the door. After a few more attempts the monster screeched at us and we heard it drag itself across the floor towards the nearby rooms. 



“Thank God, your fatass was actually useful in this situation,” Rachel said through haggard breaths. She looked at me just in time for me to slap her across the face as hard as I physically could. I slapped her so hard, I knocked her head into the door and dazed her something fierce. 



“Shut up you dumb bitch! What the fuck was that thing?!” I demanded to know from her. Grabbing her by the collar of her scrubs and shaking her back and forth. “Quit calling me names and answer me you dumb cu-” Before I could further swear at her, someone in the room cleared his throat and pulled both of our attentions to him. 



“Can you guys take this somewhere else?” Spencer asked us as he smacked a pack of cigarettes against his gloved hands. He had surgical gloves over his hands and I recognized them as the ones we had at the office. 



“Y-you can’t smoke in here,” I told him, tossing Rachel away like she was a sack of potatoes and looking over at Spencer as he laughed at me. “One, this is a doctor’s office and two smoking is bad for you.” I was in total mom mode since I hate people who smoke. It’s a nasty gross habit, and it's probably the biggest waste of money I can think of. Tangent aside, Spencer continued to laugh at me. 



“Lady, at this point in my life, smoking is the least horrible thing I’ve done to myself.” He reached his hand up to pull down his facial mask and I was horrified to see that the lower half of his face was completely skeletal. His nose was gone and replaced with the holes where it should have been. He flicked the box of cigarettes up and got one to stick out of the box. He leaned down and placed it between his teeth before he fished out a lighter from his pocket. 



“You lost more skin, you freak?” Rachel asked as she walked over, blood streaming from her forehead from where she’d landed after my smack had slammed her head against the door. “Dr. Harrison told you to stop testing on yourself.” She scolded, before looking over at me and tsking in anger at the fact I had fought back against her. 



“I don’t remember him telling me that. All I remember is him saying that I should stop testing on myself. Not that I have to.” Spencer chuckled as he lit his cigarette and began to take a deep drag of it. The smoke billowed from his jaw and his missing nose. Too grossed out to keep looking at him, I turned away and stared at Rachel. 



“What the fuck was that thing?” I asked her again. She looked over at me and rolled her eyes. “Either you tell me, or I’m smacking you again,” I warned her, and judging by her reaction she wasn’t too keen on that option. 



“That’s the patient. Something went wrong and Dr. Harrison lost control of her. And well…she turned into that thing.” She sighed as she crossed her arms at me. “She whipped Dr. Harrison with her tail and knocked him out cold.” 



“How the hell does she turn into that after a simple surgery?” I asked her, Spencer letting out another laugh, clearly enjoying all this. 



“This wasn’t a ‘simple surgery’. The three patients besides this jackass,” She motioned at Spencer who waved at the two of us. “Are meant to provide Dr. Harrison with more skin, and in turn get their skin replaced with silicone and plastic. He’s done this hundreds of times and this is the first time something like this has happened,” ahe told me, walking over to the medical cabinet in the room and opening it with her key. 



“Why would Dr. Harrison need skin for?” I asked her, Spencer let out some more chuckles as smoke poured out of the crevasses in his exposed skull. Rachel ignored my question as she pulled out a few vials of morphine and placed them on the counter just under the medical cabinet. 



“For me? You shouldn’t have Rachel.” Spencer said with fake surprise, it was then that I noticed that even without opening and closing his mouth he was able to talk at the same volume and with the same clarity as if he wasn’t smoking a cigarette. 



“It’s not for you jackass. It’s to sedate that thing outside,” she said, quickly checking the cabinets for any syringes. But she quickly came up empty, the entire room had been completely cleaned of syringes. “Give them back.” She ordered. I thought she was talking about me, but then her accusatory gaze turned to Spencer who was staring up at the ceiling. 



“You gotta fix that lightbulb,” he said as Rachel walked over and grabbed him by the hoodie strings. Almost as quickly as she did, however, Spencer pulled a gun out and pointed it straight at Rachel’s forehead. “Don’t touch me,” he ordered, and Rachel quickly let him go. 



“You had a gun the whole time?!” I asked him incredulously, which quickly turned to fear as he turned the gun on me. “W-who are you?” 



“Me and Dr. Harrison have an understanding. He stops my skin from falling off any further, and I keep him well supplied with whatever medications he needs to run the clinic. Simple business.” He took one last full puff of the cigarette and allowed it to drop to the floor, crushing it under his foot. 



“He can’t fix your skin if he’s dead, idiot,” Rachel told him, still insulting the man who had a gun trained on her. He looked over to her and then back at me before letting out an annoyed sigh. He lowered his gun and reached into his pockets, pulling out a couple of syringes. 



“How deep are those pockets?” I asked him, he looked over at me and I could just tell that if he had the ability to smile he would’ve been. 



“Wouldn’t you like to know?” He snorted as he handed the syringes to Rachel. “Just dope that thing up and I’ll finish her off with this.” He reached back into his pockets and pulled out a syringe filled with what looked like blue glowstick fluid. “Don’t ask what it is, 'cause I’m not answering that.” He told me before I could even get the thought into my head.



Rachel picked up the vials of morphine and started filling a couple of the syringes with it. She walked over to me and I half expected her to stick me with one of the needles but instead, she handed me one. 



“Don’t make me regret this,” she said, walking over to the door and cracking it open slightly. Spencer joined us at the door as he pulled his face mask back on and joined us out in the hallway. It wasn’t too hard to find the creature since it/she was currently busy eating the second patient who had arrived today. 



“What’s the plan?” I whispered. Watching as the monster chowed down on the poor man. He was a mangled heap of meat and plastic by the look of things. What was more horrifying was the fact that the creature was using his arms. Somehow it had just ripped them off from the joint and had placed them just below her own arms. Before I could take even more in of the monster, my ears began ringing with pain. I looked over at Spencer and my eyes went wide when I saw that he had simply pulled his gun out and shot the creature. 



“That oughta do it,” Spencer said as he waited for the creature. It screeched at the three of us, and left its meal alone, before pouncing towards us. Just as it was about to pounce on us and most likely rip us to shreds, something slammed us out of the way. I landed on top of Rachel and Spencer landed next to me. I looked over and was delighted to see that Wilson was holding the thrashing and screaming monster. He looked a little worse for wear, sort of like a melted wax statue, but he still had all that strength. 



Rachel mumbled and screamed from under me, and I climbed off of her. I could tell that she just wanted to yell at me but she let it slide for now. We didn’t even need to use the morphine, as Wilson finally managed to hold the monster still. Spencer simply walked up to the creature and plunged his syringe of glowing blue liquid into the monster. As soon as he walked away from it, it calmed down almost immediately. And then shortly after it began to dissolve and melt into a steaming pile of bones, guts, and god knows what. All of that was too much for me and it made me throw up, on Rachel’s shoes again. 



“God damn it! Not again!” She screamed. Before the two of us could start fighting each other again, Spencer loudly cleared his throat to pull our attention over to him. 



“You should probably check on the doc. I’ll be in my operating room if ya need me,” he told us as he walked past us. As he did he, reached down and picked up the syringes of morphine that Rachel had dropped when I had thrown up on her shoes. Wordlessly he plucked the syringe from me and walked away toward his room. I was blown away by just how calm this skeletal man was about this entire situation. I was just barely able to wrap my head around all this. But we quickly went to check on Dr. Harrison. Lucky for him the monster didn’t seem to show much attention to him, and we found him unconscious lying against the wall where the creature had tossed him. 



I wanted to help, but Rachel took one look at him and quickly shooed me away. She ordered me to man the front desk, and more importantly, call the person on the other end of the rotary phone and request his assistance. I was about to bitch at her, but I could tell that she didn’t need my help. So I made myself useful and returned to my desk. I didn’t exactly have a number for the person so I scratched my head trying to figure out how to call the person. 



“Just tap on it,” Spencer told me as he leaned against the entrance of my reception area. I looked over at him in confusion. In my mind, I was thinking I was going to have to tap it on the side or something. He noticed I was struggling with his instructions he sighed in annoyance and showed me how to do it. He lifted the receiver from the phone and tapped on the cradle that had been holding it. I mentally slapped my forehead and walked over to take the phone from him. 



The phone rang for a few seconds before I heard a click followed by crackling. I thought that it was going to be like talking through a tin can but the voice that came through on the phone was loud and clear. 



“James, what is it? Don’t tell me Spencer is getting into trouble again.” The voice on the other end of the phone sounded incredibly posh, like someone out of an old movie from the 30s. It took me a moment to even figure out what to tell him. 



“Um, hello sir. This is Maggie, his receptionist. I need your help.” I told him. He didn’t say anything for a few seconds. He wasn’t expecting my voice to be on the other side of the phone. I could hear a loud long sigh from him, and I could just tell he was rubbing his eyes. 



“What happened this time?” he asked, his posh voice clearly annoyed by this. I did my best to get him up to speed. He didn’t say much but did ask me a few questions for clarification. He told me that he would handle all of it and that I was to tell James (Dr. Harrison) that he should expect a visit from him soon. And with that, he hung up on me. I relayed this information to Rachel, she had laid Dr. Harrison down on an operation table and was tending to him. 



“He isn’t going to take the news well.” She sighed, rubbing her eyes and looking back at me. “You should probably actually close the clinic for today. This whole thing has gone tits up.” She sighed, shooing me away and going back to take care of Dr. Harrison. 



About an hour later I was getting ready to leave when I heard Rachel talking with someone. I assumed that Dr. Harrison was awake now. I walked to the entrance of the hallway and did my best to listen. But their voices were too muffled and I couldn’t make anything out. Rachel left the room and walked past me to check up on Spencer. I took this opportunity to walk over to check on Dr. Harrison. 



I carefully opened the door and poked my head into the room. Dr. Harrison had his face in his hands and was upset over everything. I was about to fully enter the room when suddenly he started laughing. Slowly at first but it picked up in intensity. He walked over to the mirror in the room and stared at himself. His laughter picked up as he reached up to grab his face. I saw from his reflection that a piece of his skin was hanging off from the bridge of his nose. And to my horror, he grabbed that piece of skin and began peeling it off of his face. I covered my mouth as I stared at him continuing to tear his face off, his laughter picking up in intensity as he stared at himself in the mirror. Blood started to leak down from his exposed skin. 



“What are you doing?” Rachel asked me, I quickly pulled my head out of the door and quickly pointed into the room. Rachel rolled her eyes and then poked her head into the room. And she quickly gasped and rushed into the room. “James, no! Stop that!” She shouted, slamming the door behind me and leaving me in the hallway as Dr. Harrison’s cackling picked up in intensity and volume. 



I couldn’t take it anymore and quickly ran from the clinic. I nearly forgot my things from how quickly I fled. I haven’t been back for a couple of days and I’m seriously considering quitting. All of this shit is not worth the paycheck, especially if I’m in danger of getting hurt or killed. I was nearly about to call the office with my resignation when I got a call first from Dr. Harrison. 



Inviting me on a coffee date to explain everything.
