I’m not sure why I’m even writing this down.
Maybe because if something happens to me, at least someone will know the truth.

My mom died two months ago.
Car accident.
She was coming home late from work when a drunk driver ran a red light.

It was sudden. Brutal.
No last words. No goodbyes.

I live alone now in the house we shared.
It’s too big for one person, but I can’t bring myself to leave yet.
Her stuff is still everywhere. Her shoes by the door. Her coffee mug in the sink. Her favorite blanket tossed over the couch.
Like she’s just out running errands, and any second now, she’ll walk through the door.

The first time I heard her, I thought I was dreaming.

It was around 3:30 a.m.
I woke up to the sound of her voice — faint, but unmistakable.

“Sweetheart? Can you come here?”

I sat up, heart racing.
It came from the basement.

I told myself it was just a dream.
Maybe I was half-asleep and imagined it.

The next night, it happened again.
Same time. Same voice.
Clearer.

“Come downstairs, honey. I need your help.”

I lay frozen in bed, staring at the ceiling.
I didn’t move.
I didn’t answer.

The basement door was closed — it always was — and I wasn’t about to open it.

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe grief does this. Maybe hearing her was just part of the process.
But it kept happening.

Every night.

Same voice. Same call.

And little by little, it changed.

At first, she sounded normal.
Then, the tone shifted — slower, heavier.
Like the voice was dragging itself through the words.

Three nights ago, when I didn’t respond, I heard footsteps coming up the basement stairs.
Soft, deliberate.
They stopped at the basement door.

And then… a knock.

Three slow, heavy knocks.

I didn’t move. I barely breathed.

The next morning, I found the basement door cracked open.
I know — I know — I locked it the night before.

Last night was the worst.

At exactly 3:30 a.m., I heard her again.

Only this time, she didn’t sound like my mom.

The voice was strained, broken, as if the words were too big for the mouth speaking them.

“Please. Come downstairs. It’s cold… and dark… and I can’t find my way back.”

I cried. I couldn’t help it.
It sounded so much like her… but it wasn’t her.
Not anymore.

I thought maybe if I ignored it, it would stop.

But it didn’t.

Tonight, it started early.
Not at 3:30 a.m.
It’s been calling since midnight.

And now… the basement door just creaked open by itself.
I can hear footsteps on the stairs again.

Slow. Heavy. Dragging.

The last thing I heard — just a few seconds ago — was her voice, closer now:

“If you won’t come down here… I’ll come up there.”

I’m sitting here, writing this, while the footsteps move closer to my room.

I don’t know if it’s her.
I don’t know if it’s something pretending to be her.

All I know is that whatever is outside my door right now…

It’s not my mom.
