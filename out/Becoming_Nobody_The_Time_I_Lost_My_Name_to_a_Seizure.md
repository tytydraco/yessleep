**Part One**

Hi, my name is Emilia. But it wasn't always this name. I was born with a different name, one I do not want to say, but my middle name was Emma, and that's my nickname now. I was known as "Emma" all my life, at least since I was two and started to hate my name. I'm 16 now. With my parents' permission, I was lucky enough to change it legally two months ago. I had used the name "Emilia" among my friends since the age of five, but my parents didn't know who it was. They didn't know that was me.

I was a normal kid, except for a few things. These few things made elementary and middle school some of the worst years of my life. I was diagnosed with ODD when I was six, ADHD when I was eight, and autism + anxiety when I was twelve. I was placed in the special-ed class just because of my mental issues. I felt isolated. Ignored. My whole life I was also shorter than my peers by a long shot. I was in the 6th percentile for height in 2nd grade. I was tiny. 3'8" and 47 pounds at the age of eight. Not even 4 feet by the age of nine. I was the size of a 4 year old. This made me an easy target. I was only 4'5" and 71 pounds by age eleven. I was behind everyone on puberty so I looked much younger. I also have epilepsy, and I would occasionally seize.This is where the story builds up.

I got bullied for my seizures, especially the grand mal ones. Everyone started to make fun of the movements and the foam coming out of my mouth. They didn't realize how bad it really was. I'd seize about once a week, nothing too severe, but I hated it. I was "the short kid who always has seizures".

One day in January 2020, when I had just turned thirteen a few weeks prior, I asked my parents if I could ride my bike around the trails, just for a mile or two. They agreed, as long as I bring my phone in case anything happens. I always thought they were over protective since they used to be very strict on me, but now I can see why they wanted me to. They still make me do so even to this day. The bike ride was going well until about a half a mile in, I started seizing. The seizure would not stop, and I entered what was called "status epilepticus". I seized for roughly 20 minutes. A bystander called 911 at the scene. I was already unconscious. An ambulance came to these bike trails in the middle of nowhere and found my tiny body lying there, with foam at the mouth and a bloody nose. My bike was covered in the foam and blood.

This is where I lost my name. Since I was 13, I had no identification. The closest thing I had was a purse carrying my phone with an E on it. They didn't know anything about me. Nothing. They took me there to the hospital, no questions asked. That's about it for now. See you in part two.

**Part Two**

Yup. they knew nothing... Except for a few details: White female, brown hair, blue eyes, about 12 inches long, in a braid at the back. Unconscious at the scene, but not deceased. Measured at 4'10" and 86 pounds. Based on pubertal development (remember, I was a late bloomer.) they estimated me to be about 8-11 years old, though most likely around 10. Later examination of my teeth at the scene determined I only had two baby molars left, 24 teeth in total. 

All 4 of my cuspids and all 4 of my wisdom teeth had been surgically removed (to make way for braces). They adjusted my age to roughly 12, but between 9 and 14. I had a 2 inch scar on the right side of my pelvis, a few other small scars in that area (from an inguinal hernia surgery), on my abdomen an appendectomy scar as well as a scar where a feeding tube was surgically implanted and later removed. A few hairline scars on the face as well as acne scars,  double pierced ears, many small scars on the calves and shins, as well as scraping scars on the knees and a 4-inch scar on the back of the thigh with remnants of stitches lining the scar. On the right knee there was also a well-healed surgical scar about 3 1/2 inches long. I also had a severe case of the deformity pectus excavatum, where the sternum caves in. The "crater" was around 3 inches into my chest. Both of my legs had healed tibia and fibula fractures.

I also had 2 crudely done homemade tattoos (that I gave myself) on my upper ribs of a Capricorn constellation and a goat head. They were well healed (I did them when I was 12).

I was wearing a blue short-sleeved shirt, size youth medium with a decal on it of Groot. I was wearing over it a red hoodie with the Gap brand on the front, size adult XS, and gray sweatpants, size youth large. I was wearing white socks and pink and black Nike shoes, size women's 5. I also had on a purple purse with a letter "E" on the front and a tag saying "Emilia" plus my phone number. Inside was a black iPhone 8 with a cracked screen and a power bank with a charger. I also had a wallet with cash and gift cards. I had studs in my ears and a necklace with a wolf pendant and a cross on it.

They said the details of the scars hoping someone in my area would recognize them. I was a pretty generic looking young girl, so nobody really recognized me. They put me in the hospital as "Jane Doe". I remained there for four days as "Jane Doe". I was in a coma for around 30 hours. I woke up and made a full recovery. I told them my name was "Emilia" on the second day. It's important to note this was also interpreted as "Emilie" due to me having handwritten my name on my purse tag inside. I was still listed as Jane Doe since they had no proof that was my actual name.

I just lay there waiting until someone knew who I was. No posters were shown around the city, but at the nearby middle schools and elementary schools within 5 miles of the hospital, they occasionally would send out flyers to the receptionists showing my face while at the hospital hoping someone recognizes me. They had some pictures of my scars if anyone knew them. There was a possible name listed as "Emilia" or "Emilie".

It sort of looked like this:

Possibly named "Emilia" or "Emilie"

Okay. We'll see where this leads us. These should give us some clues.

**Part Three**

And even with all these details, I still remained a Jane Doe for 4 days. My parents had called my phone looking for me. My phone was on 1% by the second day. I had just awoken from my 30 hour coma about 2 hours prior. I tried calling them back after 48 missed calls to tell them where I was. My phone died as I tried calling my dad. I plugged it in. I went back to sleep. My parents are luckily able to track my phone. The last place that they saw was our local ER.

They were deathly scared. What happened? All my friends were worried sick as well. I had over a hundred missed calls. They were all worried I did something I shouldn't have as well. I was always well-behaved, but the issue is I was easily influenced because of my special needs. Was it an OD? Did she die? So many questions, so few answers. Who is Jane Doe?

They had stopped calling me and then my mother called the hospital instead. She saw my flyer posted on the 4th day of me being hospitalized and recognized me by my tattoos and alias. She was so unlucky to receive it this day, she thought in the back of her mind. She called the hospital asking about an unidentified adolescent girl that she saw on a flyer. They said they knew of one but asked her more. She elaborated.

"Emilia.", she said. "I think that's my daughter Emma. I know she uses that name sometimes. Also the tattoos. She did those herself. You can tell that she did." She later hesitated. "It's her. It's her.", she said while in tears. There was more, but her crying made it unintelligible. She entered the hospital with my birth certificate and her driver's license. They quickly proved my real identity as A. (redacting birth first name, starts with an A.) Emma (redacted). They looked at my mother and her license plus the mother on the birth certificate. Sure enough it was her.

I had my name back after 4 days of being nameless. Emma, aka Emilia (now Emilia, aka Emma.), age 13, of <some place near Houston>.

This was one of the weirdest experiences I have ever had.
