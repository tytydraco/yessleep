In the early nineties, I got drafted for a war I neither understood nor wanted to wage. I didn't have connections or money to bribe the right people or get out of the country; lot of my generation didn't. We got loaded onto trucks and dumped onto training grounds. Most of us learned little to nothing from basic training. There was no time and no one cared. It was chaos, and even when we deployed, you got a sense that there was no plan followed, no structure, no real idea what we're doing and why. 



Little more than a month passed and we saw no combat, just shuffling in columns from one village to another. There were stories, and smoke on the horizon. Sometimes a unit would go by and we would see wounded, but to us, war was nothing more than endless exhaustion and repetition of meaningless tasks. Which was fine. After a while, we got settled. Our unit was in charge of a stretch of land between two villages, and we were split into defensive positions along crops of trees. We would get fired upon occasionally, and we would fire back. Even now I don't know who fired upon us or who I fired at - whoever it was, it never seemed like we hit anything and they never hit us. Still, in those days, it felt dangerous. Boring, too. Both at the same time, sometimes.



Weather was awful, and never seemed to change. It rained for days. Mud was everywhere. There were four of us in my little group, huddled in a trench we dug. Our position was in a grove. Towards the enemy lines there was nothing but farmland, so we could see far, and we felt fairly safe during the day. At night it was different. Clouds hid the moon most of the time. I remember standing at my guard post and straining to see in the dark before me. Looking for a shifting of shadows, or a flickering light where there should be none. Listening for something that was more than wind. God, I hated every minute of that. It never got easier for me. Others seemed to be more relaxed. I'm sure some even slept right through their stretches. To me, it was always a nerve wrecking experience.



Anyway.



At a time we had a few hard days. Rain poured, wind was relentless, and we were cold, hungry and nervous. Mud got into everything. Miserable time. We went from talking to snarling at each other, then to silence. I don't remember what I was thinking about, just that I was in sort of a daze. Maybe I even dozed off, in spite of weather. What snapped me out of it was an unfamiliar voice. I should have reached out for my weapon, but I froze instead. We had another person in the trench with us. It took me a moment to process. Laughter. Definitely friendly. C just got back from his watch and apparently brought someone with him. He wore the right uniform, although there was no mud on his. A tall, thin fellow, older than we were. In his forties, perhaps. Clean shaven, which was unusual, and with a wild mess of black hair that went against every grooming rule we had. I'm describing him the best I can, but it's probably wrong to do it this way, because when you first see him, you don't really notice anything other than his eyes. They were a mix of brown and yellow, and I swear that if you looked at them long enough, it seemed like they gave out a light of their own. I've never seen someone with that particular color before or after, and if I'm lucky, I won't.



This is the point where I want to say that I knew that there was something wrong with him the moment I saw him. That my instincts told me to stay away. None of that happened, though. I was just happy to have someone new around. His voice was pleasant to listen to, and he had endless stories to tell. I don't actually remember what he was talking about that first night; all I know is that we forgot our misery for a while and were sad to see him leave. From what he told C, he was tasked with delivering something or other and our grove was often on his path. It doesn't make any sense now, and it didn't make much sense then, but C checked him out with the command, and he cleared. We just accepted what he told us and didn't think of it. 



We had three more visits from him, all in all. Second time he came with two bottles of beer. We split them, giddy as children, but something was wrong with it or our guts and we spent the next two days sick and retching. His stories changed, or I started to pay more attention to what he was actually saying. He told us about setting fire to villages, of looting and killing, and I found myself drawing away. It was never something he did - it was always a buddy of his or a story passed around in another unit, or... I don't remember all of it, frankly. He told them with a hint of smile and as if it was all a big joke, with a wink or a chuckle here and there. I don't know. I didn't think it was wrong then, not really. I just didn't feel good listening to him talk, so I spent my time away from the group. That second time, before falling asleep, I saw him huddling with C and talking to him in a hushed tone. I couldn't see his face, but I could see C's, and he looked ecstatic, and I wondered what secrets passed between them then. He was gone by the time I woke up, and I realized how glad I was he left.



I stayed completely away next time. I had to, anyway; it was my turn to be on a watch. When I came back, he was already gone. M was still awake and staring into nothing. Others were asleep. I don't think M even realized I came back. That was fine. There was no part of me that wanted to know what was said that night, and I was happy to curl up and get a few hours of sleep. 



Next couple of days, or a week, I remember being uncomfortable and tense. C was twitchy and kept firing at something. I never saw at what, but I trusted him, and the thought we were harried kept me on the edge of my nerves. We were bickering now all the time. It never came to physical blows, but it was close, more than once. So, when he arrived, even I felt a sigh of relief. This time he had actual news about the war, none good for our side. I thought that it wasn't actually that bad - war had to end some time and sooner it did, we could go back to our lives. Others felt it wouldn't be the worst thing having to retreat from this mudhole; only C was angry about it. There was no alcohol this time, and tension made even chit chat uncomfortable. I withdrew again, willing myself to go to sleep, in spite of freezing wind.



I woke up, or I think I did, in the middle of the night. M was still awake and talking to our guest. I could see his face and those yellowish eyes, illuminated by a glow of a cigarette held loosely in the corner of his lips. You're not supposed to do that, to have a point of light at night, and I wanted to shout at him, to tell him to put the damn thing out. Yet I couldn't make a sound. It was all as in a dream, and maybe it was. His eyes locked on mine, and I swear I saw him raising his fingers to his temple, mimicking a gun, with a grin that was meant to be mischievous but looked grotesque.



Moments later, I jerked awake to the sound of a gun going off. The way I remember it now, no time has passed at all between when I tried to shout at the yellow-eyes and the sound. No time at all. I bolted up, then slipped on the mud, falling down and landing awkwardly on my left arm. I couldn't get up in that moment, but even from my position, I saw M's lifeless body in the mud a few feet away. In his right hand, he held his service pistol. C was there, as surprised as I was, and I could hear A shouting from the guard spot. I forced myself to get up. All I wanted to see was where that yellow eyed bastard went, to go after him, shout, take a shot, do something, anything. Instead, world around me went dark and I lost consciousness.



I wish there was a better ending to this story. I woke up in a field hospital, my arm broken in two places. C later told me that M took his own life. Our 'guest' was gone way before it happened - C was sure about it. Until recently, I thought my imagination got better of me that day. A mixture of exhaustion, dreams and my dislike of old yellow-eyes came together in that feverish, half dreamed event that never happened. For quite a while afterwards, every now and again I woke up in the middle of the night in my room, knowing  - without a shadow of doubt - that if  I turn my head to the left, I'll see the light of the same cigarette, of the same eyes. I never did turn my head, and if I dream of it again, I still won't. 



Life went on, hard and beautiful at the same time, and I forgot about what happened. Or, rather, didn't think about it as much. C became a mercenary, living life one pointless battlefield after another. We don't have anything in common anymore, and I doubt we ever had. Still, we keep in touch. He sends an email from time to time, I answer or I don't, depending on my mood.



Then, a few days ago, I got another message from C. He is still at it, still in mud and trenches, still killing and trying not to get killed. He also claims he saw yellow-eyed man again. C says he looks the same as he did all those years ago, that  he's telling all the same stories, this time in another language and in another land. I choose not to believe him. I choose not to look at the photograph he attached. 



Fuck him, and fuck his endless war.
