I want to share a moment in my childhood that left me disturbed for a long time. It started the day I lost my dog and found him.

We went on a vacation in my dad's hometown. My dog went missing for two weeks. I still remember the sound of his paws tapping against the floor, the way he’d wag his tail whenever I came home, and how his eyes seemed to understand me more than anyone else. Sometimes, I catch myself looking at the gate, hoping he’d come running back like he used to. I miss him more than words can say, he wasn’t just a pet, he was my best friend.

I still hold on to the hope that my dear dog was out there somewhere, safe, maybe living with someone kind who gives him belly rubs and treats like I used to. That thought helps me sleep sometimes.

I met a girl named Betty at the park while I was sitting alone, watching people walk their dogs. She had a small, scruffy terrier and a smile that made it easy to talk. We started chatting, and it turned out she loves dogs just as much as I do. We’d talk for hours about our favorite breeds, silly pet stories, and even dreams of opening a shelter one day. Somehow, being with her makes the sadness feel lighter, like maybe losing him led me to something good too.

One afternoon, we met up at the same park, our usual spot under the old apple tree. The air smelled like freshly cut grass. As we were laughing about her dog chasing a butterfly, we noticed a homeless old man nearby, standing oddly close to a tree. At first, I thought he was just lost, but then I froze. He leaned in and started licking the tree trunk. Slowly and gross. I stared deeply, not sure what I was seeing. When the man noticed me watching, his eyes widened in panic. He wiped his mouth quickly, turned around, and ran away.

I heard Betty laugh, she saw it too. I was young at the time, but even then I knew that a man licking a tree while a little girl laughed at the sight was just plain weird.

We decided to head home after that, each going their separate ways. The strange man licking the tree still lingered in my thought as I walked. It was unsettling, something about the way he ran off didn’t sit right with me. But by the time I got home, I fed the stray cat that sometimes waited by my porch, and settled into my bed, the memory began to fade like a dream slipping away.

The next morning was bright and quiet until a knock came at my door. It was our new neighbor, a kid around my age named Sammy, holding a game controller in one hand and wearing a hopeful grin. “Hey, wanna play?” he asked. And just like that, the weirdness of yesterday was pushed aside by the familiar comfort of games, laughter, and a new friendship.

The following day, me and Betty met again at the playground, our usual spot near the sandbox under the shade of a tall tree. With the sun high and warm, we decided to build a sandcastle complete with moats, towers, and tiny leaf flags. We laughed as Betty insisted her side of the castle needed more decoration while I focused on making the walls sturdy.

From across the park, Sammy stood silently, watching us. His hands were in his pockets, and his smile was gone. He looked bitter. He turned away, his face hardening, and kicked a pebble down the path. I didn't even noticed he was there.

The next day at the playground, Sammy showed up while me and Betty were finishing another sandcastle. Without saying much, Sammy walked straight up and grabbed my arm, tugging me away from Betty.

“Come on, let’s go play,” he said, almost demanding. 

I pulled my arm back, frowning. “What are you doing? We’re in the middle of something,” I snapped.

Sammy’s face fell. His eyes dropped to the ground, and without another word, he turned and walked away, his shoulders slumped. The mood had shifted, and I felt a pang of guilt, but I finished playing with Betty anyway. We said our goodbyes and went home.

That evening just before sunset, there was another knock at my door. Sammy stood there, holding the same game controller from before, looking unsure. “Wanna play?” he asked quietly. I hesitated, then gave a small nod. “Hey… I’m sorry about earlier,” I said. Sammy looked up, surprised but relieved, and smiled a little. “It’s okay,” he said. And just like that, the tension melted, replaced by the glow of friendship and the soft clicking of game buttons.

There were times where I stared at the photos on their wall everytime we paused the game. I noticed that his mom also loved dogs too much. In fact, she had more photos of her with the dog more than with her son and her husband.

As we played and our laughter filled the air, a sharp voice cut through the air. “Get home now!” It was my mom, standing outside with her hands on her hips, clearly annoyed. I jumped, startled, and stood up quickly.

"Sorry, Sammy… I have to go,” I said, already heading toward the door.

Sammy looked disappointed, his eyes falling to the floor. “It’s okay,” he mumbled, but his voice was heavy.

Before leaving, I turned and said softly, “I’m really sorry again… we’ll hang out soon, I promise.” Then ran off.

As soon as I reached home, still catching my breath, mom’s expression shifted from stern to excited. “You won’t believe this,” she said, smiling and excited. “He came back.”

Confused, I tilted my head. “Who?” Then I heard it, a familiar bark from the backyard. My heart stopped for a moment. I sprinted out the door and there he was, my dog. Dirty, a little thinner, but very much alive. I dropped to my knees as tears welled in my eyes. “You’re back…” I whispered. He barked joyfully and lunged into my arms as I laughed and cried, hugging him tightly like I never wanted to let go again.

The next afternoon, the park was full of life. Children’s laughter floated through the air as we all played hide and seek beneath the tall trees. Me and Betty were teamed up, giggling as one of us counted to twenty behind a slide. Everything felt normal, like any other carefree day.

But as the game went on, I noticed something strange. While I was hiding behind a bush, I saw Betty sit down on the grass nearby, right in the open. At first, I thought she was just tired. But then… she lifted her leg and began scratching the side of her head with her foot.

Just like a dog would.

My eyes widened. She kept going, not even noticing me staring, and when she was done, she smiled and went back to playing like nothing had happened.

I looked around, expecting someone else to react, but the other kids didn’t seem to care at all. Some even passed by her and smiled, as if it was completely normal. I stood frozen, heart beating fast. What did I just see? I thought. The air suddenly felt heavier, and the joyful noise of the park seemed distant, muffled. Something wasn’t right.

Later that day, I walked home with my thoughts still tangled around what I saw at the park. My mind kept replaying the image of Betty with that weird behavior. It didn’t make sense.

As I reached my porch, Sammy popped up from behind the gate, grinning and holding the game controller again. “Wanna play?” he asked, cheerful as ever. I nodded slowly, still shaken, and followed him inside. But as Sammy turned to lead the way, I froze. Swinging behind Sammy, just barely peeking out from under his shirt, was a tail.

A short, wagging dog tail.

My mouth fell open. “S-Sammy… what is that?”

Sammy stopped in his tracks. His body tensed. Slowly, he turned around, eyes wide with panic. “You saw it?”

I didn’t answer. I just pointed.

Sammy’s face turned red. “I didn’t mean for you to..." he stammered, then suddenly ran away quickly, out the door and into the yard, disappearing around the corner.

I stood in the middle of the room, stunned and speechless. Something strange was happening. I was starting to feel like I don't want to stay in this place any longer.

For days, I tried to move on. I forced myself to forget everything. I focused on school, helped around the house, and played fetch with my dog again, thankful to have him back, warm and alive. Things started to feel normal again.

One lazy afternoon, I wandered into the backyard to check on the small dog house we built, tucked under a tree. “Hey, boy,” I called gently, expecting to see my furry friend curled up inside. But as I peeked into the little shelter, my blood ran cold.

Inside the cramped dog house, wasn’t a dog.

It was an old man.

The same homeless man I had seen licking the tree trunk in the park.

He wore the tattered shirt my dog chewed last night. It blinked up at me, crouched like an animal. As I observed its eyes and its manners, it was indeed my dog! I screamed, stumbling back.

In a flash, it scrambled out, leapt over the fence, and vanished into the trees behind our yard.

Shaking and breathless, I ran inside. “Mom!” I cried.

I already sensed she wouldn't believe me. I was too embarrassed to tell her. But I told her anyway. Panicking, almost crying, I told her about our dog becoming a man.

Mom just stared at me, clearly annoyed.

“Soon, honey. Soon. It’s just one more week before we go home.”

I was never a fan of books, but I buried myself in reading anything to avoid going outside. 

Finally the day arrived, we were about to leave this strange town. By morning, we were on the road, heading back to our old home in the city.

I looked out the car window, the strange town growing smaller behind us. I didn’t know what I had witnessed. But I knew one thing for sure, I was glad we were leaving it behind.

But a quiet guilt began to creep up inside me. I felt a deep sadness for that old man. I was still young, and fear outweighed my compassion. I can only hope he found a kinder, more loving home than the one I could offer.
