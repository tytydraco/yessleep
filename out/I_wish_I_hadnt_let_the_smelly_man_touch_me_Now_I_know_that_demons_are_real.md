I thought that I was going to die, but for all the wrong reasons. It was a damp, drizzly Tuesday in my local train station, and I was getting ready for another damp, drizzly day at work.

Then the man showed up. 

He staggered forward, wrapped in a black raincoat. At first, I thought he was about to tumble onto the track.

Then he fell into my arms.

I nearly collapsed with the impact, but I managed to hold us both upright. He was so wet and slick that he nearly fell out of my grasp. He smelled like body odor and fear.

The man looked at me. His eyes were lime green. He pulled something from his pocket; before I could react, an open switchblade was touching my bladder.

My heart jackhammered as fear shot through my body. I considered running, but knew that he would disembowel me just a little before I could push away. I tried to ask what he wanted; my mouth was too dry to form words.

“Do you want to live?” he hissed. No one was close enough to hear.

“Y-yes,” I stammered.

“Did you think about how important that question was before you got out of bed today?”

I stared at him, confused and terrified. “What do you want, man?”

He licked his lips. They were very dry. “Take it and run,” he ordered, placing something heavy in my hands.

I took it. I ran.

I didn’t stop until I was back at home. Suddenly, going to work didn’t seem so important. 

Only when I was finally inside my apartment, dripping wet with the door locked behind me, did I look down at what he gave me.

It was an egg. Though much heavier than any other I’d ever felt, and pitch black, it was undeniably an egg.

What should I have done? What would you do?

The thought of throwing it away terrified me. I convinced myself that doing so would bring the man back to me, and that he would finish what he started at the train station. 

I decided to keep it.

I’m very bad at making good decisions.

I stayed in my apartment all day.  I watched the egg. Nothing happened.

Until it did.

The egg began to shake. Tiny cracks appeared on the obsidian surface; I leaned closer.

I shouldn’t have leaned closer.

A slimy, green talon whipped out, lightning-quick and covered in goo. I was able to shield my face with my left hand just in time to block its attempt to gouge my eye. Red-hot pain seared through my flesh. I staggered backwards and stared at the hideous thing.

The talon slowly withdrew, looking like a verdant slug with knuckles, and disappeared back into the egg. I stared as the broken shell patched itself up and became whole once more. It sat still, with no evidence of what happened other that the puddle of its unholy crimson yolk on my table. 

That, and my shredded hand. There was a claw mark on my flesh, and that patch of skin began to itch. 

Throughout the day, the itch became a fiery pain, which grew into paralysis. I can no longer move my left arm. 

I remembered the man in the black raincoat. How he staggered as though one of his legs wouldn’t cooperate. 

It’s not just my arm; this thing has gotten into my mind. I can’t eat. I can’t sleep.

And I can’t suppress the overwhelming compulsion that I need to give this damn egg to someone else.

To that person, I’m preemptively sorry.
