My close friend Austin passed away a few weeks ago. I found him at my place, or rather, at our place. Austin and I were college friends. We were actually living in a dorm, but after Austin and I became close, we decided to move into a separate apartment. We rented this apartment. It wasn't very big, but it was enough for the two of us.

We easily managed most things by sharing the work. Ironing, cooking, grocery shopping... That day, it was my turn to go to the market. I went out for shopping around 7 pm. Not long after, about an hour and a half later, when I returned home, I saw a scene that will be etched in my memory for the rest of my life.

Austin was in the living room. The living room was in shambles, everything was broken and scattered.  The full-length mirror was shattered. Austin was lying in the broken glass. His eyes were open, his hands and arms covered in cuts, blood flowing from his throat forming a small pool on the side, and strangest of all, there was a bloody mask next to him. It was a baby's face, with protruding cheeks and forehead, exaggerated eyelashes, and a grin covering half of the face. I actually noticed the mask after the police and ambulance arrived at the scene. Because the whole time I was focused on trying to bring my friend back to life. Austin was already dead when I arrived. That's why he was taken out of the house in a body bag. God... I collapsed onto the couch. Two hours earlier, we were joking around with each other. Now he was in a black bag and I was... a man left in a void.

It was definitely murder, so the house was now a crime scene. I was homeless. Luckily, my grandparents had a summer house in the same city as my university, and I moved there temporarily.

When my parents heard about what happened, they were very worried about me. I wanted to continue going to school, but my mom insisted that I see a psychologist and even made an appointment for me. I didn't say much during the first few sessions because I didn't think it would help. So what changed my mind? The visions that started two weeks ago.

My grandfather's house is detached and huge. Also, I haven't uncovered most of the items, so it can be scary at night. One night, I went downstairs from the upper floor to the kitchen to get some water. When I turned my head to the left on the stairs, I saw him. He was about my height, a rather overweight man wearing a bloody butcher's apron. His chin was visible under the mask. And yes, it was that mask. The mask next to Austin. I climbed a few steps up the stairs and hid. I thought about calling the police. Then, when I turned my head to look again... he was gone. Still, I called the police to come check my house, but they found no one. And I'm sure they thought I was crazy as they left. The thing is... at that moment, I felt that way too.

When I told the psychologist about it, he said I was having delusions. The human brain can see hallucinations after such ‘traumatic’ events. But it kept going. Sometimes it would walk past me while I was having breakfast in the kitchen. I would freeze in shock. Then I would get up to check, and he wasn't there. At first, it was so terrifying it kept me awake all night, but over time I convinced myself it was just my imagination. At least, I tried to. But it kept getting worse. There were moments when the killer, whom I had only seen wandering around, would stop and stare at me, sometimes following me. And then the voices started. While I was in the shower, I heard a knock on my door. A few taps. Then it stopped. And believe me, no matter how much the soap stung my eyes, I didn't even blink during the entire shower. It's all in your head, Caleb, calm down. These aren't real. I kept trying to calm myself down like that.

One night, I woke up with a sudden jolt. I was drenched in sweat. Because I was... tied to the bed. It wasn't just an illusion. Even though I pulled on the ropes, my arms and legs wouldn't move. I only noticed the man in the baby mask when he moved. He took a step toward me. Even if I screamed, my neighbor probably wouldn't hear me because the house was detached. With every second he slowly approached me, I struggled and trembled more. He positioned himself right at my head and, unbelievably... he touched me. When his hand grabbed my chin, I froze. He was holding me tightly. He was turning my head from side to side. Then he lifted my head and leaned over me. This isn't a nightmare, I said to myself. This isn't a nightmare. I could smell the dry blood on the mask. He leaned close to my ear as if to whisper, and then... I don't remember what happened next.

When I woke up, it was morning. My hands were free, and the man in the baby mask was gone. Still, I woke up feeling like I'd been beaten up that morning. I didn't see anything else all day. In the evening, I decided to leave the house for a walk. As I walked along the sidewalk in front of the house, I saw our neighbor Julia a few blocks away. I remembered her from a few summers ago. I had met her when we visited my grandfather, and we hung out together. She greeted me. I greeted her back. She asked why I had come here. I told her what had happened to my friend, without going into detail. While I was talking, she suggested we keep walking. I agreed, and we started touring the neighborhood together. I must admit, I hadn't had a normal conversation with anyone in a long time, and while talking to Julia, I realized how much I missed it. We walked together until it got dark. Then she went to her house and I went to mine. Before leaving, I said we should do this again. She agreed. Talking to her was even better than seeing a psychologist. So much so that the hallucinations began to subside to the point where I no longer needed medication.

Julia and I would meet outside and go for coffee. We talked about our hobbies. For example, she was studying at the conservatory. She told me about her dreams of becoming a musician. I played the guitar too, but obviously I wasn't as skilled as her. As I did things with her, I stopped going to my psychologist appointments. I was getting better. And also... I don't know. Julia filled not only the visions but also the void left by Austin. She had literally become my savior.

Once, she invited me to her family's house for dinner. Her family were sweet people, just like her. The warm family atmosphere... it was like a dream. It was something I had been looking for for a very long time. Since my university was in a different city from my family, I could only see them during the holidays. Julia and her family had filled that void for me. So I decided to invite her over. One night, she came to my house to watch a movie. With the lights off and a bowl of popcorn in our hands, we started a 3.5-hour action movie. Halfway through the movie, I paused it so Julia could go to the bathroom. When she came back a few minutes later, she had something in her hand.

“Where did you find that?”

I had actually forgotten it even existed. It was my grandfather's old guitar. Julia smiled at me. Then she took the guitar and sat down.

“Would you like to listen to a few songs?”

She might have been one of the most talented musicians I've ever seen in my life. Her normal speaking voice was beautiful, but when she sang, it took on a divine beauty. She became one with the song. I thought she would be a very successful artist in the future.

As I listened to her, spellbound, the sound of my phone broke the harmony of the moment. It was an unknown number. When I answered, a woman addressed me by my last name. She told me to come to the police station immediately.

“What's it about?”

“We've found a new lead concerning your friend Austin's murder.”

My blood ran cold. Julia could tell from the look on my face that something was wrong. I told her I'd be there in a few minutes and hung up.

“What happened?”

He leaned his guitar against the couch. I told him I had to go to the station and explained why.

–If you want to go home, I can drop you off.

–No problem, if it won't take long, I'll wait for you here. Besides, the movie's only halfway through.

The offer sounded tempting. I told him I'd be home in an hour at most and went outside.

How could I have known...

When I got to the police station, a police officer greeted me. We went to one of the interrogation rooms. It annoyed me that no one was explaining what was going on. Finally, when we sat down at a table, one of the police officers spoke.

–Caleb, we didn't want to call you back here, but there's been a major development.

–What is it?

He handed me a note hesitantly.

–Do you recognize this handwriting?

The note looked like it had been torn from a notebook. And it definitely hadn't been written with a normal pen.

–This... What's that on it?

–Blood. A note written in Austin's blood. It was just found at home.

I looked at the note again.

–Caleb, will you answer the question?

–No, I don't recognize it.

–Well, did Austin have any enemies who would do this?

–You already asked me that.

–I know, but maybe after this new detail, someone will come to mind.”

No one. No one came to mind. Austin had always been a somewhat introverted and polite kid. I was sure no one would kill him so brutally. When the police realized they wouldn't get anything out of me, they let me go.

I want you.

The words written on the little note. All night long, it was as if someone was screaming this inside my head.

I want you.

The police thought the note was written for Austin. But what if it wasn't?

I was a mess. I literally couldn't think. I was walking around in a daze, my head completely empty. I was like a zombie. All I wanted to do was go home and sleep. So I was going to tell Julia I was too tired and we could continue the movie another night. I called her. But she didn't answer her phone. I had called when I left the police station, and she hadn't answered then either. I figured she had already gone home since I was late, and I didn't think much of it.

When I was about 100 meters from home, my neighbor's voice made me turn my head that way. Mrs. Susan was walking her dog. When she called my name, the empty street echoed. She asked how I was doing. I gave short answers so as not to prolong the conversation and kept walking. But she stopped me again.

“Caleb, I want to warn you about something.” Or rather, I want you to warn someone about something."

“Who?”

“Your friend.”

I thought she was talking about Julia, but I was confused.

“What? Which friend?”

“The one walking around with that mask, for God's sake. Please tell him not to walk around with that damn thing. It's scaring my dog, Dexter.”

I couldn't respond.

I just froze there. Mrs. Susan said goodbye and left. I realized I was shivering even though it was warm. Hallucinations... Were they real? Only one name came to mind. Julia. She wasn't answering her phone. She... She was alone in the house with the killer. I ran home. I opened the door so hard I almost broke it. I shouted Julia's name throughout the house. I was afraid to find her dead in the house, but worse, she was gone. Julia had vanished into thin air. The house was just as I had left it. The only difference was that guitar, which she had leaned against the chair, had fallen to the floor. There was a note next to the guitar. This time it was a note written in pen.

I want you.

I called the police. The police searched the entire house and neighborhood. There were no signs of a struggle, no signs of forced entry, and no blood. So no one could figure out exactly what had happened.

Since I was involved in both a missing person case and a murder case, they took me into custody. But it was certain and proven that I was in a different place from the scene of the crime in both cases. So they let me go. Still, Julia's family blames me. I blame myself too. For leaving her alone at home.

I left the summer house and checked into a hotel. My mom and dad insist I come stay with them, but I won't go. Because I'm scared. More for them than for myself. This killer isn't a delusion; he's hurting people around me. I'm afraid he'll do something to my family too.

I checked into a boarding house. I hadn't been there a day. I fell asleep without even taking off my clothes, exhausted. I woke up to the sound of the door at night. Someone was trying to force my door open at the cheap boarding house where I was staying. I jumped out of bed in a panic, but there was nowhere to hide in the one-room place. As I ran to the bathroom and locked the door, I heard the sound of the main door lock being broken. I could hear his footsteps. He was walking around the room. I even heard him throw a few things.

My phone was left outside. There was nothing here I could use to defend myself. I was writhing helplessly inside the room. Then the footsteps stopped. There was no sound for a long time. It was as if time had stopped. Until a piece of paper slid under the bathroom door. I was startled by the sound of friction. I stared in horror at the randomly torn piece of paper. It had a single sentence written on it in capital letters.

I want you.
