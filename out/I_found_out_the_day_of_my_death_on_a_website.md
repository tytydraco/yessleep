I can’t tell this story to anyone, but I need to get it off my chest. So I will write it here. 

Names have been changed.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It all started in 1996. My parents had just bought our first home computer - one of those bulky machines that sat in the living room for the whole family to use. On the rare occasions when my parents weren’t around, I would turn it on and scour the Internet for things little children aren’t supposed to mess with. One afternoon, my dad was at work and my mom ran to the shop, leaving me home alone for just a few minutes.

I typed www . death . com into the search bar.

I often made up creepy website names. I was a curious child and I wanted to educate myself on the things adults were afraid to talk about. The website that popped up was a gloomy page featuring the drawing of a skeleton in a black cape. It read: ***Do you want to know when you will die?*** 

It prompted me to enter my name and date of birth. I did - then clicked on ***Submit***. As soon as a new window opened, I instinctively closed my eyes. Did I really want to know when I would die? No, I didn’t. Did I believe that a scary website could actually know the date of my death? No, I didn’t. But… you never know.

I nearly jumped out of my skin when I heard Mom’s keys turning in the lock. Mom would be furious if she knew what I was up to - she thought I only dealt in stuffed animals and Disney princesses. I grabbed the mouse and darted toward the little X in the top right corner of the window. In the process, I stole a quick, furtive glance. A tiny glance. 

But I saw it alright: ***August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AM.*** 

In the years that followed, I lived my life without ever thinking about that stupid website again. 

Did I, though? 

*… August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AM … August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AM … August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AM…*

That date was burned into the back of my mind. It sat there like a relentless ticking clock I never dared to speak of. It only left me with 26 years - which doesn’t sound too bad, but it really isn’t that much when you think about it. Although I would never allow myself to acknowledge it, I rushed to achieve my goals because I secretly feared time was running out. I wrote like crazy throughout my twenties until I managed to publish a novel. It sold decently well. Seeing my creation on library shelves helped some of the anxiety subside. At least I had made my mark in the world. A small mark. I needed to keep going to make it bigger. 

I wrote another novel that I was convinced would become my masterpiece. It was rejected by every single editor. 

I had never felt so hopelessly crushed. One night, in the midst of a panic attack, I opened my laptop and went back to that website. 

I landed on a grey, empty page. All it said was: ***This Domain Name is for Sale!***

Relief rushed through me. This whole death prediction thing was a hoax from the early days of the Internet - meant to attract traffic from credulous children like me. Obviously. Afterwards, I developed a more relaxed disposition. But only to an extent. I still had a lot of work to do on my way to greatness and I’d better not procrastinate.

I married Tim on a bright summer day. From the moment I met him, I knew he was the one. Sweet, dependable, down-to-earth. As a tax accountant, he had a comfortable paycheck, great benefits and a solid life insurance policy. Sure, he wasn’t the most adventurous man in the world, but who cared? He believed in me and was happy to support me while I poured my time into my literary endeavours.

August 20, 2022 came around. You may ignore the passing of time all you want, tell yourself that a certain day is still far off - but that day will come. 

Oh yes, it will. 

I pretended that there was nothing special about August 20, 2022. Still, I took some precautions. In the weeks prior, I’d put myself through a battery of medical checkups. Not that I had any symptoms - indeed, the doctors confirmed that I was healthy as a horse.

Even though August 20 was a Saturday night, I made no plans. I sat in front of the television and did not budge. Tim went upstairs at 10 PM. He always went to bed early. I wished I could join him, but for some reason I absolutely had to finish binge-watching some meaningless Netflix show.

*August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AM. What if I die in my sleep?*

At 11:31 PM, I started feeling a tingling in my nails. I wiggled my fingers - it went away. 

A few minutes later, it came back. As any sane person would do, I pulled out my iPhone and Googled it. None of the medical conditions associated with nail tingling could possibly apply to me. As I had already established beyond a reasonable doubt, there was nothing wrong with my body. The only condition that did match, was anxiety disorder. It was 11:40 PM on August 20, 2022 and I had to face it: I was really, really anxious to go on that website again.

My fingers flew across the touch keyboard. Hoping to land on ***This Domain Name is for Sale!***, I crashed back into that old webpage from 1996. But this time, the caped skeleton was pointing at a real-time clock: 

***11 : 44 : 01 PM***

***11 : 44 : 02 PM***

***11: 44 : 03 PM***

The room started spinning… the ground gave way beneath my feet. What kind of sick joke was this? That website was supposed to be down. How did it recognize me from 26 years ago? I didn’t use the same Google account! Google accounts didn’t even exist in 1996!!

Wait… I wasn’t being rational. What the screen was showing me was just a real-time clock. There was no actual piece of information tied to me. Most likely, the original creators of the website had bought back the domain name and decided to play a prank on anyone who had been on it back in the day. Sooner or later, someone would go on the website at an unfortunate time - and get scared out of their mind. 

*Why won’t this tingling stop?*

I tossed my phone on the couch and went back to watching TV. I refused to be intimidated by such nonsense. But I could not understand anything the characters on the screen were saying. 

I glanced at my nails. They looked a bit dark. Had they always looked this way?

Almost without thinking, my hand grabbed the phone again. I checked the timer: 

***11 : 48 : 05 PM***

“So what?” I told myself. “This is a night like any other night. It will pass and the sun will rise and the darkness will be forgotten.”

DRIIIIIIIIIN

I shot up from the couch. WHAT WAS THAT?!

The doorbell. Just the doorbell. 

Our house was pretty isolated but every now and then, bored teenagers would bike out to the edge of town and ring random doorbelles for kicks. I looked through the peephole: just the dark, empty street. I unlocked the door. Maybe I could catch them - give them a good scolding. As I pushed the door open, a gust of icy wind slithered inside, engulfing me in cold, lonely despair. I slammed the door shut and backed away into the warmth of my home. 

DRIIIIIIIN

Again?!

“Go away!!”, I shouted. I strained to hear anything outside. Nothing. No giggling. No footsteps. No bike wheels turning. Just dead silence. 

*August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AM*

I looked through the peephole.

I SCREAMED. 

But the scream didn’t come out. It turned inward - digging into my lungs - as I stood there breathless, my mouth agape like the corpse of a hanging man. 

Outside my door was the skeleton in a black cape, its unnatural grin and hollow eyes boring into me through the peephole.

I scrambled back to the couch, snatched up my phone, dialed 911 and started jabbering: “Help! Someone at my door - trying to get in -  help - they want to hurt me!” … Then I realized that the call hadn’t gone through. I had no reception. Zero bars. In fact, the reception symbol was gone altogether. 

Suddenly, the phone fell from my hands. I had finally noticed it. 

My nails. Black. Broken. 

Rotten. 

*August 21, 2022 at 12:05 AM*

It was real. It had always been real.

I lunged at my phone. Thankfully, it was still intact. I opened the browser and went back to the website. 

***11 : 54 : 58 PM***

DRIIIIN

My heart jumped into my throat. It tasted like blood.

11 minutes to go.

I took a deep, trembling breath. I was a smart woman. There had to be something I could do to save myself. Every problem has a solution, doesn’t it?

I brought my phone closer to my face, scanning every inch of the webpage, looking for a clue. A loophole. Some guidance from the devil himself.

There it was! At the very bottom of the page, almost invisible: ***Contact***

I slammed my thumb down. A chat window popped up.

***Sleepy Friend: Hi Suzanne!*** 

It knew my name. At this point, I wasn’t even surprised.

***Sleepy Friend: Congratulations on your upcoming death! How can we help today?***

***Me: I dont want to die***

***Sleepy Friend: How can we help today?***

***Me: i dont want to die!! please make it go away*** 

***Sleepy Friend is typing….***

My eyes snapped to the timer. 11: 58 : 31 PM.

Come on! I had no time to waste!

***Sleepy Friend: We understand that you requested a personal death prediction on October 13, 1996.  We are proud to say our predictions are 100% accurate.***

***Me: i dont care! i dont want todie!!!***

***Sleepy Friend: We understand that you requested a personal death prediction on June 13, 1996.***

***Me: IT WAS A MISTAKE***

***Sleepy Friend is typing….***

***12 : 00 : 00 AM***

***12 : 00 : 01 AM***

***12 : 00 : 02 AM***

My limbs were curling up, tightening into a sort of rigor mortis. 

***Sleepy Friend: I see. Don’t worry, Suzanne - all mortals make mistakes. We proudly implement a near-unlimited satisfaction guarantee.*** 

My body relaxed a little bit. Maybe there was a way out of this nightmare.

***Me: so i’m not gonna die??? is the mnster goig away??***

***Sleepy Friend is typing….***

***12 : 02 : 10 AM***

***Me: am i safe or not??***

***Sleepy Friend: However, since our operator has already reached your address and the scheduled pick-up is less than 3 minutes away, it is against company policy to send him back without a retrieval.***

***Me: wat does that mean?you said satisfaction guarantee!!!***

***12 : 03 : 02 AM***

***Sleepy Friend: We are happy to accommodate our customers in any way we can. You are welcome to enter the personal information of an alternative subject.***

***First Name:*** 

***Last Name:***

***Date of Birth:*** 

***Me: wat do you mean??***

***First Name:*** 

***Last Name:***

***Date of Birth:*** 

I tried to swallow but my saliva had thickened into gravel.

He was content with his life. He had lived a GOOD life. Would growing old and sick make him any happier? Probably not. Sure, he was a competent tax accountant. There were thousands others like him. Did the world need more tax filings from him specifically? Not really.

***12 : 04 : 23 AM***

I, on the other hand, had important work to do. I was creative, I was unique. My new novel was coming along nicely. It just needed time to mature. TIME.

***12 : 04 : 51 AM***

I brutally silenced my thoughts. Like a machine, I typed hard and fast. 

Tim’s first name, middle name, last name, date of birth. 

***12 : 05 : 00 AM***

I held my breath. Eyes fixed on the front door. Waiting for the Horror to come through.

DING

I jumped. 

It wasn’t the doorbell - just a notification. Sleepy Friend had responded.

***Sleepy Friend: Thank you, Suzanne. The team wishes you a long and happy life.***

***Sleepy Friend has exited the chat.***

That was it? 

The timer ticked on peacefully. 

***12: 05 : 59 AM***

***12: 06 : 00 AM***

***12: 06 : 01 AM***

And I was still alive. 

I looked down at my nails. To my immense relief, they looked perfectly normal. The thought occurred to me that perhaps they had always looked normal. Maybe the fear, bottled up for 26 years, had made me hallucinate.

With newly-found courage, I walked to the front door and peered through the peephole: only the empty street. 

For the first time that night, I suddenly felt clear-minded. It was like I had just woken from a bad dream into an ordinary, reassuring reality. 

It had all been an elaborate prank. And a very tasteless one at that. I didn’t know how they pulled it off, but after a good night’s sleep, I would figure it out. 

SWOOSH

As I turned around, the hairs at the back of my neck stood up. 

The caped figure was gliding down the stairs behind me. Its bony grin flashed in the dim light.

My legs were two pillars of stone. I stood still as the figure breezed right past me. The front door swung open in its wake. The figure blended into the night. In the blink of an eye, the door was closed again.

I picked up the phone and dialed 911. I did not bother checking the bedroom. I knew what I would find. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I buried my husband Tim three years ago. He died of a heart attack -  surprising for a man in his thirties, but not so surprising considering both his father and uncle suffered from heart problems.

He is sorely missed. As the wonderful provider that he was, he left me with enough money to support myself while I write full-time. 

I still haven’t finished my masterpiece. I am so damn close, but something always holds me back. Some days, I can’t focus on my manuscript for more than a few seconds at a time - I keep thinking that I might be about to die and the panic makes my brain go haywire. Other days, I simply stare at the wall, drenched in the weight of this never-ending existence.

I think the uncertainty is killing me. Maybe if I knew what to expect… Maybe then I would feel motivated again.

I did check the website. It looks exactly as it did in 1996. 

***Do you want to know when you will die?*** 

***First Name:***

***Last Name:***

***Date of Birth:***

***Enter***

Should I do it?
