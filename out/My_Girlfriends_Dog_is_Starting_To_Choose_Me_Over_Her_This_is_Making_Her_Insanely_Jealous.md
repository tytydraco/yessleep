Her name is Lola and she has the most strangely beautiful eyes that I’d ever seen. One of her eyes is a vibrant shade of glacial blue. The other one, a deep, warm brown that by no means was any less beautiful.  Apparently, the medical term for this condition is Heterchromia. It’s supposedly very common among Huskies.

Despite being such an ardent dog-person, I admit that I never actually knew that different colored eyes were so common with that breed of dog. My girlfriend Stephanie’s dog Lola was the first Huskie that I had actually ever seen in person. Despite being so huge, Lola’s cool eyes and permanently plastered doggie smile told everyone that she was a total sweetheart. Lola just seemed to love everybody. Unfortunately, in my case, that was especially true.

I guess I should probably start from the beginning. I met Stephanie six months through a dating app. Stephanie was absolutely gorgeous, but I’ll confess that the first thing that I noticed about her was her online profile picture of her alongside her dog Lola. I used to have a golden retriever and I’ve always had a huge soft spot for dogs. The fact that Stephanie was a dog person like me was a plus.

Stephanie and I started dating almost immediately after I messaged her. Normally I like to take things slow but with Stephanie it was quick and passionate. After two weeks of dating, we were already talking of moving in together. I don’t know what it was about Stephanie, but I just could not find one single flaw with her. She was perfect in almost every single way.

It was about a month into dating Stephanie that I noticed Lola was starting to really warm up to me. One Saturday, whilst eating at an outside table at a local café, Lola moved away from sitting next to Stephanie and sat down right next to me. It was a subtle move, but it didn’t escape Stephanie’s razor-sharp attention. She looked at Lola and then back to me and Stephanie’s mouth opened in a sort of fake display of shock.

Truth be told, it was actually fairly rare in my experience for a dog to do something like this. My previous dog, Winter, used to get really jealous around girls that I dated. Eventually Winter would begrudgingly accept them, which meant ignoring them totally, but Winter would never take her attention off me and put it on them. In this case, Lola seemed to focus on me a lot. I didn’t mind though. Lola was such a sweety that I gobbled up the attention.

Anyway, despite the situation being a little strange, Stephanie didn’t seem really upset at first.  It wasn’t just that incident though that got me thinking. When we took Lola on walks together, Lola would always want to walk beside me. If we ever threw her one of her favorite toys, Lola would always bring it back to me instead of Stephanie. 

I told Stephanie stuff like that didn’t mean anything. Lola still loved Stephanie the most, I assured her. It likely just meant that Lola approved of me. “My charm works on all woman, babe. Even Lola!”, I joked. Stephanie didn’t find this joke amusing at all.

Several months went by when one evening Stephanie wasn’t feeling too well. Because of that, I decided to take Lola on her walk solo. Stephanie didn’t object and Lola and I walked all throughout the neighborhood that afternoon. When we got back to my house though, my next-door neighbor Meredith was outside getting ready to go to yoga class. She ran up to me and started petting Lola energetically who playfully responded. Meredith and I got to talking and she asked about Stephanie and how everything was going with us. I told her that everything was going really well and I couldn’t be happier.  We were exclusive and things were pretty serious. Meredith said that she was really happy for us.

“Wow, I can’t believe that she might get someone like you to settle down, once and for all. She must be really something!”, she said and playfully shoved me.   

When I turned and started to walk up my driveway, that’s when I found Stephanie standing by the opened front door. She saw me saying goodbye to Meredith and how much I had been playing with Lola. She was staring at me in a way that I had never seen. Her body was almost visibly shaking with anger. She looked to Lola who whimpered slightly.

“Sorry it took us so long, babe. Everything okay?”, I asked. She ignored me and stormed back into the house.

Stephanie didn’t talk to me the rest of the evening. I just couldn’t figure out what was really wrong. She agreed for me to take Lola on a walk.  I asked her beforehand and she said that that was totally fine. I guess maybe that was one of those times where someone says ‘Sure’ or ‘Fine’ but whatever it was, it definitely wasn’t ‘Fine’.  

I resolved the next evening that I would make it up to Stephanie by taking her out to dinner at a fancy seafood restaurant called La Mer. It might have been a bit overkill, especially considering the prices of their dishes, but I couldn’t help myself. I wanted Stephanie to be happy. Plus, it was at that dinner that I did something that made Stephanie incredibly happy.

The restaurant, despite being so fancy and a bit pretentious, had a very rustic feel to it. Almost like a country French kitchen type of place. Along with that, they didn’t have traditional menus. Like many places nowadays, you have to scan a QR code that was at the table. I scanned the code from my phone to pull up the menu. Since it was just my phone, Stephanie and I had to pass it back and forth to decide what we wanted. It was during this that I suddenly had to use the restroom. I was stuck with a dangerous dilemma. Did I leave Stephanie alone, with my unlocked cellphone and use the restroom… or did I make up some wild and unbelievable excuse to get it back from her and head to the bathroom with it?

I took the plunge and said I’d be right back and left my phone alone with her. I left Stephanie, alone with my unlocked cell, for ten whole agonizing minutes. When I got back, Stephanie had the biggest, most beautiful smile that I had ever seen. I felt so proud of myself. If there was some perfect boyfriend test out there, I’m sure I just passed it…

The next few days with Stephanie were total bliss. Everything was going so smoothly until police sirens interrupted our Netflix binge of a new series that we had recently started watching. I live in such a peaceful neighborhood that the contrast of flashing blue and red lights was striking. Lola was barking like crazy and would only calm down if I petted her. Stephanie said she would go check it out. I tried to protest but Lola would just not calm down, so I agreed.

Stephanie went outside for about fifteen minutes and when she got back inside, she said that our neighbor Meredith was missing. Her poor husband had filed some police report and they were questioning him. Apparently, he had a dark past and a bit of a criminal record that I knew nothing about. Stephanie said she got the impression that the police heavily suspected that he was involved but didn’t give details. They asked Stephanie if we ever noticed any strange behavior from him or her recently, which she said that she didn’t know.

This news about Meredith left us a bit shaken up. I just couldn’t imagine that a guy like her husband would hurt Meredith. I guess you just never know what lies in someone’s heart, especially a neighbor you see for just a few minutes every week. Anyway, the next day the police formally arrested Meredith’s husband. He might have been locked up, but I refused from that point on to let Stephanie walk down the street alone until we were sure it was safe. 

A few more months went by and I decided that I might finally be ready to ask Stephanie to marry me. Well, at least I thought that I might be. A dangerous murderer living next door might have been scary but marriage scared me even more. At least it used to. I must have hid my fear of commitment pretty well though because Stephanie recently had been dropping major hints about rings and talking about her college friends getting married. Normally, when this stuff happens with girls that I date, I take it as a sign that I needed to break up or get out of the relationship. With Stephanie though, it just felt right. 

Maybe it was the fact we were both always so in sync that explained my willingness to entertain the thought. Her being the most beautiful woman that I had ever met certainly didn’t hurt either. Like when I had my birthday back in March, she knew exactly which jacket that I had searched online to buy for me. Or maybe it was the fact that we also seemed to think the same thoughts. For example, one day after work I was a bit late getting home. I had gone by the grocery store to buy her flowers and some dog food for Lola. I coincidentally bumped into Stephanie in the pet food aisle and we both laughed. She just looked so relieved that I cared so much to pick up some dog food right after work. 

Things had also settled down a bit between me and Stephanie surrounding Lola. Lola was still paying me way too much attention, but I think I managed to handle it a lot better. I always made sure Lola still went over to Stephanie when she started hanging around me too much. Things eventually started to look a bit more balanced when it came to Lola. 

The only other incident that I can recall that made Stephanie visibly upset was when I was watching a movie on the couch one evening while Stephanie was making us some drinks. I was pretty stressed out about an upcoming project at work, and I worried that I wouldn’t be able to make some deadline imposed by the new department head. I wasn’t really paying much attention to the movie when my phone rang. My coworker Laura’s voice immediately hit my ears and she was freaking out. She had some family emergency and wouldn’t be able to finish her part in a project that we were both working on. This news couldn’t have come at a worst time. Laura’s confession that she wouldn’t be able to finish her part meant that she was basically putting all the burden on me to finish everything up. 

Anyway, I tried convincing Laura to find some time to either work on it or help me convince our boss that we needed an extension, but I realized that it was pointless. After about ten minutes I said I would take care of it and Laura seemed relieved. “You’re the best, I don’t know what I would do without you!”, she told me before I ended the call upset. Lola could sense something was wrong and immediately jumped up on the couch to cuddle with me. It was so unbelievably sweet, but I found Stephanie glaring at me from the kitchen. As soon as I caught her staring, she smiled slightly and then walked in with the drinks. I could tell though she was pissed so I gingerly placed Lola back on the ground.

I spent the next few days finishing up my work project solo. Laura didn’t even bother coming back to work. The night before the project was due, she sent some very weird text message to me and our boss that she was quitting and taking a trip abroad alone to ‘discover herself’. This didn’t sound like Laura at all, who was very shy and hated traveling. It sounded more like me and Stephanie, who loved traveling and taking weekend trips. Finishing up the project myself was stressful beyond words, but my boss was so impressed that he gave me a promotion to team lead and gave me a significant pay bump.

I decided at this point to do what felt right in my heart. I stopped by Tiffany’s on my way home from work and bought an engagement ring for Stephanie. Despite how unbelievably scary getting married was to me, along with the anxiety-inducing price tag attached to the thing, I felt like I was ready. The stars seemed to be aligning and were whispering at me that now was the time.  

I was so excited and nervous about asking Stephanie to marry that I called my sister yesterday for advice. I had to sneak outside to make the call while Stephanie was inside working on her laptop. I had already mentioned in person to my sister the last time that she was in town that I was thinking about getting married. As soon as I called her, the first words out of her mouth were “Did you make a decision yet?”. I took a deep breath and said “Yes, I’m going to do it”. She asked whether Stephanie suspected anything, but I grinned and said that I hoped that she had no idea. 

My sister then asked about Stephanie’s family and whether I had asked her dad for permission, all that traditional stuff. I told her that I hadn’t, I wasn’t even sure how to get in contact with him. That’s when my big sis started asking all kinds of questions about Stephanie. How could I not know her dad and her family? Wasn’t this maybe a bit sudden? All that overly protective big sis type stuff. 

I started to get a little defensive. I mean, sure it was quick but it wasn’t too hasty. Half a year is no big deal to go from dating to getting married. Besides, who cares, I can find all that other important stuff out later.  We had a lifetime to finish getting to know each. The important thing was that we loved each other. 

I couldn’t quite seem to convince my sister that I was making the right decision, but she said she supported me. 

“I love you, sis. Don’t worry, I’ve got everything under control. Can’t wait to see when you’re back in town!”, I told her before we hung up. 

After our conversation I got a flash of panic in my stomach. Was I really ready to marry someone that I had just met? I looked up and saw Stephanie standing by the glass door that led to the back yard. She was staring at me and was holding a kitchen knife that she must have used to cut up an apple, her favorite snack. In her other hand was her cell phone. Her face seemed to emotionless but her eyes were locked onto mine. 

I immediately started looking around for Lola outside. To my relief, I noticed that Lola was standing right next Stephanie inside doing that “I have to go outside and do stuff” dance that only dogs can do. I smiled and waved to Stephanie, the woman of dreams and future wife. She smiled and then waved back, with the hand holding the knife.
