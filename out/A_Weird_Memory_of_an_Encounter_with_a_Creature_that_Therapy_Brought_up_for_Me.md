I can remember when I was 15, I had gone just off the path of Willow Road to share a joint with Earl and Steven T. The bus was set to arrive soon. We had tricked my mom. She thought that the bus would come fifteen minutes earlier than it did so that we could all ‘hang out’ and get high before the bus. Earl pulled out his god-awful weed, an array of stems and seeds barely held together by dried-up flower that made shake feel luxury. Back then, though, it was worth breaking the law for.

The screaming caught us off guard. It wasn’t wailing, like someone got attacked. It was more like an argument between people who had completely lost the plot. Senseless; could barely make out a word. Earl ran; we called him a pussy for that for years, but in retrospect it was probably the best decision. I made the oddly responsible choice to call the cops. Steve didn’t run but he also didn’t want to be around if any cops arrived. He went to meet Earl at the bus stop. 

I was so afraid that the cop would care that I was ‘smoking a cannabis cigarette ma’am’. Lol. It’s funny how little perspective we have as teenagers. 

The scene was still unfolding. The screams were coming from the church at the end of the road, Our Lady of Ketari. The dispatch officer told me to describe to her what I saw, and I did.

There was a truck there; big—larger than a pickup truck but smaller than a Mack truck, I said. It has a yellow light flashing on top of it, it might be some kind of forestry truck.

The officer said that I didn’t need to describe the truck so much—shit. That terrible weed got me so high back then.

The man from the truck had gotten out and was arguing with the people from the church. He was pissed, angry. He was an Indian man. Like, a Canadian-Indian man. Not that Indian people can’t be Canadian—like, indigenous kind of Indian, I meant. The cop almost seemed to be holding back laughter. What is the man doing? Why is he yelling?

He’s screaming and pointing at them. He’s got his hands in their faces and I think that the forester guy might hurt the church guy. 

He’s getting into his truck again. Oh no, I don’t like this at all. I don’t know what he’s doing but he’s in the truck, he’s starting the truck…

He’s driving forward now—oh my God, he’s driving into the church fence—what the fuck?

The cop tried to get me back on track, to snap me out of it. 

This was the part that has caused me so much trouble. 

The man drives this big truck right into the fence. Just barely misses the church guy; church guy had to jump out of the way. I caught a glimpse of something otherworldly, then. Something was behind the fence, and I think that maybe this thing was making the screaming noises, not the man in the truck. There’s more than one. There’s a bunch of those things.

What things?

What things? I don’t know. They’re owls, maybe?

Owls? The woman on the other side of the phone line grew soft in tone, as though she were comforting her son who had just had a nightmare.

I remember insisting to her that the owl things were real. And they leapt up over the truck and scurried away into the neighborhood. They were quick; they looked owlish but they ran upright on wily appendages, claws uprooting the earth at the apex of the nasty critter’s limbs. 

Send an officer. 

I was so sorry that I was high; I still am. I don’t know if they took me seriously after that, but the police did eventually respond. I didn’t know what to do and so I just waited there… I expected a cop to come speak to me, but none ever did. Eventually I walked to school.

I stood there for so long. 

When I googled this again recently, I re-read news about the lady who got mauled by the weird, unidentified animal. That must have been related. And I was just standing there, outside, like bait. What if it had just come straight for me instead?

I felt guilty about that for a long time—as though I had somehow wronged the woman who got mauled or that I made a mistake by not calling the police sober. I’m older now, and I know that that’s just not how life works. I probably did the best things available to me within my power and knowledge at the time. I definitely did better than Earl did. 

I’m still living with the trauma of it. I can speak about it now, but for the longest time I was afraid of getting in trouble for being high and so I never told my family. After years of forcing myself to ignore it, I just forgot about it for a while. Recent reflection on my life brought the experience to the forefront.

There’s no real information available on what I saw. Just vague articles about a woman being mauled by an unidentified animal on her porch. 

Maybe if I call the police, I can get an update because I was one of the reporting witnesses? I don’t know; it was so long ago now. I do not think that it’s really important anymore. Whatever happened was handled by animal control and the cops. 

I feel certain about what I saw but I’ve also had many people argue with me that it was just the drugs leading me to incorrectly perceive a puma or something. I don’t feel convinced about that. Marijuana doesn’t really work that way. I was light-headed and distracted and confused but I know that I wasn’t hallucinating. By then, I had already been smoking for months—I had a good grasp of the effects on my body and mind. 

I don’t know that I love how therapy has brought this memory to the surface again. I’m not sure how relevant it was to what I needed the therapy for in the first place. Now I am worried I might need additional therapy for this, lol. Really, though; this has created an upsetting set of questions and insecurities about my memories and the lasting impact of this very weird experience. 

The therapy is going well otherwise, if you’re wondering. I appreciate you caring.

It’s not very cohesive as a narrative, I’m sorry. I’m rediscovering this as I go. Sorry.
