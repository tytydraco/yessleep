A few weeks ago my roommate, Oscar, died while caving. I still remember how I felt the night he never came home, sitting with his parents for hours while we debated calling for rescue, or just hope to god he'd walk through the door with nothing more than a few cuts and a phone full of pictures. I still feel the tension in the room, the anxiety that he wouldn’t come back alive, and how much I hated myself for not doing more to help before it had got as far as it had.
Now I wish his body wasn’t found. The fear of not knowing what happened to him and the lack of closure were nothing compared to the anguish and pain I felt whenever my mind forced me to think about his death and the agony he must have faced.

To explain the events surrounding his death, I need to go back a few months, back to before he even found the cave and dedicated his life to it.
Oscar had been caving for years. His love for going down into the depths started during a school trip to Wookey Hole. I still remember walking through the chambers with him and seeing the wonder and awe in his expression, and how he had begged the teachers to let him explore some of the tighter caves.

By the time we finished our first year of university, he had explored a good number of the caves in the area, and by his third year, he was going out on a trip almost every week. At first, I found his hobby incredibly stressful to deal with, imagining him alone in the caves, rocks pressing in at all sides as he found himself stuck, not to mention the sections of flooded cave sections where he’d have less than an foot of space to breathe, or even just all the money he spent on equipment. But the more he came back, with at worst scrapes, cuts, and bruises, and the more he showed off the pictures he took, telling me the stories of his adventures… Well, I’d never gone down there with him, but I understood why he kept going back, and began to trust him to stay safe.

4 months ago, Oscar learnt about a cave system near the town we lived in. I’m not going to say anything in terms of location or the name of the system, as I still live close by, and I would rather avoid people trying to find where I live. It’s just better for everyone.

The cave system wasn’t well known, not even being officially mapped out yet. While, at the time, I thought this was weird, Oscar's reaction to me asking about it put me at ease, claiming it wasn’t that out of the ordinary, and at worst he could map it out himself and maybe get some cash for it. Within the week he was planning a visit, and on the weekend he was packing his gear and driving out. I still remember how excited he was, the permanent smile on his face as he got ready.
He returned home later that day. Typically, when he got back from a caving expedition, even the shorter ones, he would be giddy, showing me all the photos he’d taken of the cave. His camera roll full of mineral deposits he swore he knew the names of, or of tight passages he’d record himself sliding through. He’d tell me every detail of his trips in intense detail: the feeling of the pressure of the stone and rock around him, having to breathe in, using his entire body to progress inches at best. I hated the idea of being stuck down there with such little space, but the excitement in his voice as he spoke always had me listening with full focus.

Today though, he said nothing, simply trudging back into the flat with a groan, chucking his rucksack on the floor, and storming into the bathroom for his post-cave shower. When I had the chance to ask how it went, he just scoffed, “Barely had the time to do anything; don’t know why I even bothered going down there,” before returning to his room. At first, this confused me, but remembering about his work the next day and exam season coming up, I blamed stress and didn’t think much about it, even if I wasn’t sure how 8 hours of caving qualified for  'Barely had enough time to do anything'

I did try talking to him about the cave a few times, but all I’d get was some vague information about the journey down, not bothering to even describe the rocks or much of anything about the cave itself – it was all just very general and somewhat useless information. Since it was clear he didn’t feel like talking about it, I stopped prodding.
On the final day of exams, as soon as we left the building, he ran straight to his car. Straight back to the cave. I knew he was going to do this; hell, I was part of the reason, since I had sort of suggested the idea on a particularly sour night of late-night cramming. I remember watching him leave the campus, hoping he would find what he needed down in the darkness.

He was gone for nearly 2 days. I wasn’t a stranger to him being gone for a while; 16-20 hour caving trips weren’t common, but they did happen. Considering that he left relatively late in the day, when he wasn’t home the next morning I didn’t think too much. When he wasn’t back by evening, I was worried, and when I woke up in an empty flat, I started freaking out. He came home after just under 46 hours, covered in cuts and scrapes, and absolutely ecstatic. As much as I wanted to yell at him for scaring me, I decided to give him grace, and let him talk as much as he needed about what he had spent his time doing down there.

We talked for hours about the process of getting in, the exploration of the caverns, and his goals in going back. I will admit, even with the frustration I had felt for how long he took, I was happy for him.

I’m going to take a moment to describe the cave, how he gets down, and what he found, because I think it’s important to understand the situation he would find himself in later on.

The cave entrance was in a woodland outside our city, so not only would you need to drive out there, but also hike a good 30/40m into the forest to find it. It was a hole in the ground, a 10-foot drop which you’d abseil down with a rope tied around a tree. From there, it’s a tunnel that led, as Oscar estimated, around 15-20 feet down. Sloping down and around, the tunnel slowly constricts from walkable, to tight enough that you’d need to crawl. At the end of this was a flat, straight squeeze of about 30 feet, the ground of which was covered in small sharp stones that Oscar complained about heavily. 

This opened up into the main room. A few passages stemmed from here, and while I got explanations of them in detail, they aren’t relevant, so I won’t describe them here. On the first night he went, Oscar only managed to explore one of these out of 8, which is apparently why he had come back so upset; he just hadn’t had the time for the rest of the tunnels.
In the main room, aside from the passage in and the passages out, there was the funnel.
The funnel was a hole in the wall, leading to a small tunnel with an opening on the other side. He called it the funnel as at the start, the passage was a good 3 feet wide and 1 foot tall. But as you shuffle your way in, it slowly converges into a tunnel far too small to ever be able to crawl through.

At its tightest, it was barely 7 inches across and 8 inches tall. Not even enough room for his head, let alone his shoulders. It was impassable. As you can imagine, an impassable tunnel to a virgin cave tunnel was equal parts exciting and frustrating for Oscar. The allure of being the first person there was intoxicating, but being stopped from exploring by a foot of cave too small to progress through must have eaten at him constantly.

I remember the confidence in his voice when he said he would get through to the other side, and the conviction in his eyes as he detailed his plan. He would explore the other tunnels again, thoroughly, and if there was no way in through them, he would come back with chisels and hammers to break his way in.

I wasn’t sure if that was allowed, but I didn’t care enough to stop him. This clearly meant alot to him, and based on the lack of information about the cave online, it was unlikely anyone with authority would even care. Although, I did ask him why he wanted to get to the other side so badly. I remember his confused expression upon hearing me ask,but I don’t remember if he ever gave me an answer. I think he grumbled something under his breath, just quiet enough for me to not hear the words. I’m still not sure if that was on purpose.

For the next eight weeks, Oscar went down to the cave every Saturday, mapping the side tunnels of the main room out, trying to find any work around the keyhole. Unfortunately, he did not, returning home with plans already made in his mind to go to visit every hardware store in the city the next day to find the best supplies. A week later, he began his task that would soon become his obsession, to carve the hole wide enough to crawl through.

I joked about Ted the Caver a fair bit at the time, the story of two friends excavating into a section of virgin caves, trespassing into a place they never had the right to enter. Oscar just laughed it off, claiming that if God didn’t want him to explore, he wouldn’t have made the entrance so enticing.

Something told me Ted would have argued the same thing.

Before long, he deemed his progress too slow, that weekly trips would never be enough to get through the rock in a reasonable amount of time, and began going more and more often, to the point he was going to the cave nearly every day he wasn’t working.

I wasn’t concerned about this until he missed a shift at work. I hadn’t been paying much thought to his comings and goings, and although I was confused that he wasn’t going to work, I assumed he booked the day off. That was until a few hours after he left, when his boss called the home phone asking where he was. I asked Oscar about it when he got home, to which he just said he forgot he had work that day, “No big deal.”, before brushing me off and going back to his room. 
I didn’t think too much about this until a few weeks later. This was due to the fact that, every morning, I heard him when he left the house. 8am for work and 6am to go caving, and I’d hear him when he’d come back, either returning at around 8-ish if he went to work, having gone to the gym afterward, or 10pm if he went to the caves. It was admittedly lonely, never having my only other roommate around, but I just focused on getting ready for graduation, and the job searches to come.

3 weeks before his death, I decided to visit him at work. For context, he used to work in a sandwich store in the town centre, and since I was in the centre anyway for an interview, I figured stopping by wouldn’t be an issue.

That's when his coworkers told me he had quit. 2 weeks prior. The day after he missed his shift, he quit with no notice. In order to hide this from me, he had been pretending to go to work, wearing a uniform up to the forest before changing and going down into the cave.To his credit, he did stop at the gym after, but only to shower off the dust and rock before heading home.

I was livid. Not just from the idiotic decision of quitting his job for some stupid obsession, but also from him hiding it from me in the way he did. When he got back from that day's trip, I yelled at him until I lost my voice, demanding an explanation. 

I still remember what he said when I finished.
“This is why I didn’t tell you. I knew you wouldn’t even try to understand. All that matters to me is getting through the cave.”

I made a lot of mistakes throughout this situation. One of the biggest was letting my emotions control me. I was mad, upset, and I felt betrayed. Instead of seeing the situation with the concern that it deserved, I got angry, and stopped caring altogether. “If he wanted to throw his life away, that was his choice” I said to myself. “So long as rent and bills got paid, he could deal with this himself”. That's how I saw it at the time anyway.

I stopped paying attention, I didn’t listen to him in the morning, and barely paid attention to if he had come home or not, which he began doing less and less. I guess only to eat and sleep.
A few days before his death he came back home while I was grabbing a drink, and I could immediately tell something was wrong. His right shoulder dipped at an angle I can’t even recreate while trying to form the words to write this. It was close to a 45-degree slope. I called after him asking what was wrong, but he ignored me and went to his room.

I saw him the next morning, and got an answer after I refused to give him his car keys. He snatched them from my hand and glared at me.
“I just injured myself. It’s not a big deal. Stop acting like you care.”

After that, he stormed out of the house.
All day, I couldn’t get the image of his shoulder out of my head, and upon asking my nursing friend about how he looked and hearing that it sounded like a broken collarbone, I realised just how bad of a roommate I was being.

I know this realisation came too late; I know you are judging me for my inaction and for my passiveness, and it’s not like I don’t deserve it. I knew his obsession with the cave was bad, but to the degree of potentially breaking bones and still going down there? That was a level beyond.
I thought he was being stubborn and rude; I thought him quitting his job and hiding it from me in the way he did was out of spite. It wasn’t a secret he didn’t like his work, and the way he spoke to me when I called him out just told me he didn’t trust me to understand.

I guess in a way, I didn’t.

Later that day I finally called his parents and told them everything. It wasn’t a fun conversation, and to this day I know they probably blame me for his death. I know I do. I told them how he was going down there a lot, and after he was injured and kept going, I was getting worried for him.

The next day they came over, asking where Oscar was. He had already left for the cave that morning, so they waited at the house for a few hours, sitting with me in silence.

When it became clear that he wasn’t coming back any time soon, they made me tell them where the cave was, and then they went on their way. I offered to come alone, but they refused, saying that Oscar didn’t need “unwanted stress”.
I don’t know what happened that night specifically, but from what I was able to understand from the police report and his autopsy, it was this.

His parents waited outside the cave into the late night until they got worried, then scared, and then called the police.

They sent a cave rescue, who found his body immediately. It was tightly pressed into the funnel, tight enough that his body was crushed, bones snapped, and organs pierced. The skin on his face had ripped apart from the pressure on his skull and the friction he had fought against.
He had crushed himself to death.

The official cause of death was due to a cave-in, but I knew that wasn’t true. I saw the photos from the scene and knew it wouldn't have made sense for it to have been that.

A few days ago, I found his caving journals. While I’m not going to upload them verbatim, I’m going to explain the extra context they give.

The entries, at the start of his expeditions, were very similar. The more I read, the more unnerving they became; the handwriting got messier, and the descriptions of his actions went from deliberate and detailed to just short phrases like “I broke a bit off”.

As I read, the notes became logs of his progress to angry, unhinged rants. Scribbles on paper, full of rage at not being finished, full of expletives and venom. He began to insult me, his work, and his parents, constantly. When I got to the day he quit, half of the entry was celebrating, and the rest were tearing me apart for making him have to work so hard to hide what he did and limiting his newfound freedom, as he still had to keep appearances for me.

By the time he broke his collarbone, calling them journal entries would be entirely a lie. Each page was just nonsense rambling. Ranting about how he needed to keep digging, how he needed to not give in to the voices begging him to stop, and how he would get his reward even if it killed him.
Finally, I got to the final entry. It was written the morning of his death.

Pages of tearing me apart, of insulting everything I was, pure rage. How dare I call his parents? How dare I get involved? How dare I get in his way? After he turned back on his parents, insulting them for being controlling, for how they just hated their freak son, and for how they want to take away the only thing left in his life. At the end was a promise that no matter what, he wouldn’t come back until he got past the funnel.

Even if he had to kill himself to do it.

Yesterday I visited the cave. I don’t know where the compulsion came from, but as soon as I realised I was even considering it, I started researching what I’d need. Most of his stuff fit me, and most of it he hadn’t taken on his final day.

The journey down was surprisingly not as terrifying as I thought, even after trapping myself in one of the squeezes needed to get into the main chamber. I still don’t understand why I felt so comfortable; maybe I was just distracted.
I found the funnel without much effort. The rock was stained in his blood, and I once again didn’t react properly. It was like something about the caves just made everything feel so… normal?
It was identical to the photo he showed me the second time he came back from here. Save the blood.

Oscar had spent months to get through this passage; he had spent hundreds of hours on his dream and given his life for it. I imagined him in his final moments, pressing himself into the hole in front of me. I imagined how much pain he must have been in as his bones snapped and his skin stretched and split as his insides pressed and crushed. Did he even know he was dying? Something about being here made me doubt it.
I won’t even know what led him to doing what he did. Hell, I don’t even know HOW he did it, how he kept the strength to keep pushing forward, how he ignored the agony. Part of me doesn’t want to know. Nothing can be done about it now; even if I did figure it out, he’s still dead. And it’s still my fault.

I’ve been thinking a lot while writing this. About the events that caused his death, about how I reacted, and what more I could have done. And how I can make it up to him. I’m going to try and break through the funnel; maybe if I can get across and see what he always wanted to see, I’ll stop hating myself for letting him die.
No, I’m not doing this for my own comfort. I’m finishing what he started, what he gave his life for. I’m doing this for him.

For Oscar.
