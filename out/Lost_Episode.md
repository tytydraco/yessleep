I was and still am a huge Amazing World of Gumball fan. It may be childish and have some of the dumbest punchlines, but that’s why I like it. It takes me back to times where I wasn’t as bothered and stressed as I am now. AWOG has always been known for its upbeat kind of episodes (except for the insanely popular The Grieving lost episode) so when I saw this, I just couldn’t believe it.

In 2013, I remember this episode that I’ve seen only one time, and it lives rent-free in my head. It was called “The Terror” and started off with the normal catchy theme song and it looked like a normal episode, but it didn’t feel like one. Every single time Gumball would say something, it sent a sense of unease down my spine, but I brushed it away thinking I was scared for a test the next day for class. Slowly, the episode got weirder and weirder. All of the kids went to school (full backpacks and “normal” middle school stuff) but it was in the middle of the night. Once the bus came, a hideously terrifying entity told the boys to get on. It was an unexpected jumpscare but now it had me on the edge of my seat. They say nothing and take the ride to school.

 Once Gumball and Darwin arrive at school, they start to stalk Alan in the dark. They get closer and closer while Alan screams bloody murder at the top of his lungs. Once Gumball and Darwin catch up to Alan, the lights go pitch black and then turn on again. I’m excited because I’m ready for another jumpscare, but nothing happened. Alan was floating there, strictly alive without a look of emotion on his face. Gumball and Darwin were just laughing and talking about how they could’ve popped him and left him until the morning until the school janitor arrives. 

Afterwards, they started to stalk Tina. The same thing happens as they walk closer and closer while Tina’s roars get louder and louder. The lights go out and turn back on. I’m still ready for another jumpscare since we haven’t had one since the beginning, but no jumpscare was there. Tina was now sitting down crying silently while Gumball and Darwin were laughing at her. 

They then start to walk towards Anais and do the same thing, but this time Darwin backs out because she’s his sister. As soon as Gumball hears this, his neck turns 180 degrees, looks at Darwin, and spins back around all in about 5 seconds. At this point, I’m hating this episode but it literally feels like I can’t stop watching it. Basically, Gumball is stalking Anais and actually starts running towards her, but this time the camera is in a 1st person view and it constantly changes back and forth from Gumball running towards Anais to Anais running from Gumball. We can clearly see that Gumball is outrunning Anais and will eventually catch up and when he does, we’re put in the first person perspective of Anais. The TV turned completely off but I had assumed I sat on a remote or something, but looking back at it now, the remote was nowhere near me. Once I got up and turned the TV back on, we were still in the first person perspective of Anais. When she looked down, there was nothing but fire, melting faces, and screams of agony. I quickly turned the TV off again and kept it off for the rest of the night.

I wish I could find this again but unfortunately I think it’s lost forever. The strangest part is that it didn’t scare me. It was literally making me nauseous out of anxiety. It’s still one of the weirdest episodes of any TV show I’ve ever seen and the first episode of a series to make me anxious like that. If anybody finds this, do not watch it. There might be an audio distortion that made me feel like this but I don’t know for sure and when I ask someone about this, they say they’ve never heard of it and brush it off.
