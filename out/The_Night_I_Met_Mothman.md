Twenty-seven years ago, I was just an 11-year-old kid living in the quiet town of Gallipolis, nestled in Vinton County. Our home—a weathered red brick house, though time has dulled my memory of its exact hue—stood ominously across from an old cemetery, its crumbling gravestones whispering secrets of the past. The cemetery, overgrown and forlorn, had seen better days, with an abandoned barn nearby, its rotting beams and rusted nails a grim reminder of neglect. The playground at school was just a stone’s throw away, but my brother and I, along with our cousins, found our misguided adventures in the shadows of the graveyard.

 

We weren’t disrespectful—just hood kids from the city, playing tag among the tombstones, our laughter a thin veil over the somber atmosphere. I vividly recall rushing home every night, breathless and sweaty, as the streetlights flickered on, a warning that trouble awaited if I lingered too long, or worse, if I faced an inevitable ass-whoopin. You know, the kind that makes you question your life choices as you scramble for safety.

 

On one particular night, the familiar sound of my parents arguing pierced through the walls of our home, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife. Eager to escape the oppressive atmosphere, my brother and I slipped out to the porch. The full moon hung high in the sky, casting an eerie glow over everything, transforming the familiar into something unsettling. I turned to my brother and suggested we venture across the street to the cemetery for a little game of tag. He followed, though he wore a distant look in his eyes, still trapped in the remnants of sleep.

 

As we wandered, the peacefulness of the night was suddenly interrupted by a dark shadow soaring overhead. We exchanged bewildered glances but shrugged it off, thinking it was just a bat. However, a second swoop sent a chill down my spine. By then, we were near the far end of the cemetery, far from the comforting glow of our home. My brother, now visibly frightened, bolted back toward the house, and I, sensing something was amiss but driven by curiosity, trailed behind him.

 

Once inside, he muttered he was off to bed, but my adventurous spirit urged me back outside. I tiptoed back to the cemetery, glancing up every few seconds, the adrenaline coursing through my veins. Time felt distorted as I wandered around, lost in thought until a loud SWOOSH echoed, like a giant bird gliding in for a landing. Heart pounding, I looked up just in time to see a colossal figure silhouetted against the moonlight. 

At first, I was confused, remembering a character from a show I used to watch called \*The Tick\*, who had a sidekick with butterfly-like wings. But this creature was no cartoon. The figure was enormous, its wings spreading wide, casting a shadow that engulfed me. As it glided closer, I caught a glimpse of its face—an unsettling, moth-like visage with beady black eyes that seemed to shine with an otherworldly light. Fur or hair, a dusty gray, covered its body, and I felt an instinctive dread wash over me.



In a panic, I turned and ran, my heart racing as I sprinted back toward the safety of my home. SWOOSH! The creature swooped again, the sound echoing in the stillness of the night, and I could feel the rush of air as it passed overhead. I reached my front porch, gasping for breath, my mind racing with questions and fear. I stumbled inside and collapsed into bed, trying to convince myself it was just a figment of my imagination.

 

The next day at school, I couldn’t shake the feeling of dread. I told my friend about the encounter, and later that day, a teacher pulled me aside. "I heard you saw the Mothman," she said, her expression grave. "He’s been around since the ’80s. If you leave him alone, he’ll leave you alone, but if you’ve caught a glimpse, brace yourself for some bad luck." I told her what happened, and she just smiled knowingly, adding, "Make sure you stay out of that cemetery from now on."

“How did she know?”

Kids being kids, I ignored her warning and returned to the cemetery with my cousins. We were having a great time playing tag until I ran too close to the old barn and stepped directly on a rusty nail, the pain shooting through my heel like a lightning bolt. I was trapped, surrounded by boards with nails sticking out, feeling like the walls were closing in around me. My cousin ever vigilant heard my cries and rushed over, and in a panic, he stepped on the other end of the board, knocking the fear of the night before into me and the rusty nail in my foot out. It was a strange kind of fear, one that both intrigued and terrified me. The kids at school had been buzzing with stories about Mothman, but I hadn’t known anything about him until I asked a few friends during lunch. They filled me in on the legend—how he was said to be a harbinger of doom, a creature that appeared before disasters.

 

I listened, wide-eyed, as they recounted tales of sightings in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, just a short drive away. Some said he had been spotted near bridges before they collapsed; others claimed he was seen before fires or accidents. I had never been one for ghost stories, but this was different. This was real. I had seen him with my own eyes. 

As the days passed, I couldn’t shake the feeling that my encounter had somehow marked me. The shadows in the cemetery felt heavier, the rustling of leaves seemed more ominous, and even the playful laughter of my cousins took on an unsettling edge. I became hyper-aware of every creak in the house, every flicker of the streetlights outside. My brother, who used to be my partner in crime, now seemed preoccupied, his demeanor shifting as well. We no longer ventured into the cemetery, and I began to dread the thought of being outside after dark.

 

One evening, as I sat on the porch, watching the sun dip below the horizon, I felt an overwhelming urge to confront my fear. I told myself that I had to go back, to face whatever had terrified me that night. Maybe it was a way to reclaim my childhood, to prove that I wasn’t afraid of some myth. So, as the sun set and the shadows grew long, I made up my mind.

 

I slipped out of the house, my heart pounding as I crossed the street to the cemetery. The full moon cast an eerie glow, illuminating the cracked gravestones and overgrown weeds. I felt a mix of dread and determination as I stepped deeper into the graveyard, the cool night air wrapping around me like a shroud.

 

As I wandered, the silence grew deafening. I called out, half-heartedly, “Mothman! Are you here?” My voice trembled, echoing in the stillness. For a moment, I felt ridiculous, standing there in the dark like a fool. But just as I was about to turn back, I heard it—a low, haunting sound that sent a shiver down my spine. SWOOSH.

 

I froze. The unmistakable sound of wings slicing through the air. My heart raced as I looked up, and there he was, the creature silhouetted against the moonlight, his massive wings unfurling like a dark omen. The fear that had become a part of me surged back, overwhelming and paralyzing. I could hardly breathe as I stared into those beady black eyes, feeling like a moth drawn to a flame.

 

And then, just as suddenly as he appeared, he vanished into the night, leaving me standing alone in the cemetery, trembling and breathless. The night felt heavier now, the weight of that shadow more pronounced. I turned and ran, my instincts kicking in, propelling me back to the safety of home.

 

When I finally slammed the door shut behind me, I collapsed against it, heart racing. I had faced Mothman, and now I understood the true weight of his legend. It wasn’t just about the creature; it was about the fear that lingered long after the encounter, the knowledge that some things in the dark were better left undisturbed.

 

From that night on, I knew I would never play in the cemetery again. The laughter of my childhood had faded into a haunting memory, replaced by the weight of an experience that would stay with me forever. The world felt different now—darker, heavier, and full of shadows that whispered of things best left unseen.
