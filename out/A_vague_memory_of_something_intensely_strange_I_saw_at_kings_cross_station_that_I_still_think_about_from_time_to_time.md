As a young child, the world is forced to conform to your perception of it, and I still maintain that everything that can be perceived can be logically explained, although this still evades me. Perhaps I was too young to comprehend what I had seen, and perhaps still, I wouldn't have been able to make much sense of it. perhaps the world went mad a very long time ago and I'm just becoming privy to its decline from sanity.

So anyways, here's the best of what I can recall. My apologies for any grammatical errors, its quite late as I'm writing this. I can't sleep well until I finally write this down having thought about it so much recently.

It was a spectacular day. Tinted I'm sure, by the rose tinted haze of an oblivious childhood, but a wonderful day no less, especially when you consider how abysmal a country England is. The sun was blasting down its cancerous rays, according to my mothers recollection of that day, Though her main takeaway of the outing was a horrendous sunburn I got when we were walking around the Olympic park.

I had, or was eating some kind of ice cream by the time we were waiting outside the station. My mother was gabbling away on the phone while looking at something in the distance, either the Pret or the Mcdonalds across the street, which she maintained were a scourge on what would've otherwise been a serene location, but there I was, kicking my little sandled feet against the glistening metal of the weird over engineered benches that are neither beautiful or functional as a frickin bench, when I saw a man stumping along the hot, cracked pavement.

I'm sure many others would have been quick to dismiss this man as a mad person, or a junkie, but you didn't see him the way I did.

He was clean shaven. I didn't understand the potential implications of this at the time, and still don't today.

His head flailed wildly about its axis atop a substantial neck, about which hung a tie, in distressingly pristine condition when placed into the context of the rest of his state. His arms where packed firmly into his sides, and whatever shirt he was wearing (clearly my infantile eyes deemed this unimportant information,) seemed to be adhered to said arms. He walked with a heavy, thumping gate, one which bordered on obnoxious, and though heads were turned, no one seemed to give it a second notice. Such is the nature of English folk however. People are apparently to polite to give a solitary shit about anything.  

It was only as he drew closer to me that I noticed the state of his feet.

I didn't know my lefts from my rights back then, but I recall that one of the shoes was on, and the other was off. He was, or at least, had been, wearing boots of some kind. Why, I still remember shopping for walking boots online with my mum for a Duke of Edinburgh expedition just a few years ago, (its like a camping trip and a hike which for whatever reason counts towards resumes,) and seeing what I'm sure were the exact same boots, because I keeled forward on the chair and puked right between my own legs. I digress. 

one boot was attached not to the foot itself, but by the cuff from his ankle, the sole worn completely through, and a battered foot poked out from beneath it, which would slap the pavement in a sickeningly wet manner, one which still makes my stomach turn just to think about. The other foot itself was barely attached to the leg. It smelled something awful.

I remember being so fascinated by this figure, that I didn't notice until *far* too late that he was actually moving towards me. He drew closer, and closer, and as he did, the arms broke away from his sides, and joined the terrible jig of the head, swirling and swinging about his body. He shambled closer and closer, and as his head swung once about again, I locked eyes with the man.

They were yellowed, and sunk back impossibly far into his head. They were bruised with fatigue, and crawling with varicose veins that pleaded to erupt from the thin membrane of the eyeball. I still scream when I wake, when the eyes visit me in my darkest dreams, but it's far too late for that now.

He got closer, he got closer, he got closer, till I could feel the reek of the rotting foot in the back of my throat. my mother yanked me backwards over the bench and behind her, the call having presumably reached its conclusion, and the safety of her child resuming its place of number one concern. 

I don't know what really happened next, because my mother never let me see, but the man had turned sharply away from me, and continued his walk across traffic, much to the annoyance of drivers, who swerved and swore their ways around him. I was safe.

we walked over to the bus stop where we would continue our journey home, now that my ice cream belonged to the pavement, a detail I remember being bizarrely hung up about, and for a while my main takeaway from the whole event being that my mother ruined my ice cream. The curious mind of a child I guess. 

As we walked over to the bus stop, I spotted the other boot, stood upright, with its laces undone. 

It was in a far better condition that it had any right to be in.
