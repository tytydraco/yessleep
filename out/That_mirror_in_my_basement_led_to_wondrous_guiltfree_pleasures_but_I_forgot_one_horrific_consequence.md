I’m a wannabe sadist. I guess you could say I relate to those people they profile on the TV but can’t quite bring myself to take the actions required to become as famous as them. I’ve been blessed with a ridiculous contradiction. Genuine enjoyment from imagining other people suffering physically. But a deep moral inability to act out on such imaginings with real people. I want to cause people suffering and I cannot.

You might think such a situation quite untenable, but I have a friend – Sebastian - who is also a highly moral sadist. How could two such secretive people possibly find each other? Well – Sebastian is a domestic cleaner. People hire him to go into their homes and clean and tidy. He likes it – it appeals to his sense of order. 

On that day, he was storing some items in my basement without asking me (he has great initiative). Remember those movies people move into a house with a basement full of abandoned stuff? I thought they were convenient plot points. But no, they’re real. And mine arrive courtesy of 5454 Banquo Street.  

One day whilst seeking storage space, Sebastian opened an old wardrobe down there and found a grocery bag containing some rather violent magazines. I mean nothing real – don’t worry. But rather realistic digital images of extreme sadism. And right at the moment he was rifling through this bag, I came downstairs to see what he was doing.

My face immediately went bright red. I stammered, “What…what are those?”

Now, I’m not stupid. I’m a highly educated man. Some might say a genius. I knew that he knew that I knew that he knew instantly. And the rush of relief for myself was intense. I was no longer alone! “Charles,” he said, “may I borrow one of these?”

From that day forward we have been close friends. What a thing it is to no longer feel so isolated. My happiness grew but we often talked about how strange it was to relate so strongly to the serial killers or sadists we saw on TV or movies, but feel morally obligated to not repeat their acts.

And so we happily trundled along, glad to have someone to talk to, and trapped in our grey area. Until the chair. 

I loved the new chair from Ikea. And it was while making space to store the old chair in the basement that I found a hole in my wall. So when I bought that lovely new white chair from Ikea, I needed to store my old wooden relic in the basement. I clambered down the creaky wooden stairs, using a torch (I’d not sorted out the electrics yet). It was pretty packed with old gear – a wardrobe, old chairs, a trolley of tools, you know the sort of things. All covered with a fine layer of dust.

There was a small gap beside that old mahogany wardrobe that had brought Sebastian and I together, but not wide enough for my chair. So I wedged my body in and shoved. Dust fell onto my face and I coughed. I wiped myself, tried again and the wardrobe shoved across. I jump at a light flashing in my eyeballs. It was just my super bright LED torch hitting on a mirror that had been hidden behind the wardrobe. 

It was a simple person height and mirror, on a wooden stand. With one weird thing: a large X of gaffer/masking tape had been stuck across it, as if to block it. It seemed the most natural thing in the world to pull that tape off. It came free easily from the glass, leaving an X of dustless glass. I pulled the mirror forward to get a better view. As I did so, my hand splashed into a pool of water.

I pulled it back. It was soaking wet. There must be a leak, I thought. But then I noticed: across the surface of the mirror was what I can only describe as a series of ripples, moving out from where I pushed my hand.

I became very frightened for a moment – reality sorted of did that “in-out” thing and I wondered what was real, what was not, etc. But the most natural thing in the world was to touch the mirror’s surface and the same thing happened. The tip of my finger got wet. And small ripples came out from where I’d touched it.

What happened next was so fast and shocking it took me time afterwards to piece of all together. This is what I recall. A third hand, gloved in black, shot out from the mirror’s surface, grasped my nearest wrist. I probably shouted in fear. A fourth hand, black-gloved as well, appeared from the “water” and grasped my remaining free arm. I was pulled by tremendous strength that I could not resist in the mirror’s surface and then I was…

Sinking…sinking…terrified. Trying not to breathe in water. Blackness all around. I swam myself into reverse, but there was no entryway behind me. In my panic all I could see was a faint rectangle of light not so far away. I had hardly any breath left, but I managed to breast-stroke fully clothes towards the light. I reached into it and…

I fell collapsing and soaking onto a concrete floor. It was…well it was my basement. But sat there, on my old chair I had been going to store was a woman in black, with a black facemask.

As you can imagine, by this point I was freaking out. The water had not been cold, but I was gasping for breath. Nothing made sense. The woman spoke, “Welcome to The Reflection.”

I spoke, mostly to myself, “Am I insane?”

“No,” replied the woman, “we are the only two sane people here. Everybody else on this side of the mirror is a reflection of the real world.”

“What…does that mean?” I asked.

“It means, my dear, that they walk like a duck, quack like a duck but they’re not a duck. They laugh, cry, scream and moan, but deep inside they feel nothing. They are reflections?”

“Why are you telling me this…why am I here? Why...”

She opened that wardrobe. Pulled out the plastic bag and from it drew the magazines. It had all the same exciting pictures, but back the text in mirror image and unreadable. 

She lifted up a particularly exciting picture involving a cooking element used on a captive. “They feel pain and pleasure no more than a comic character.”

I have to say that I was convinced at this moment I was insane. I was terrified. “Is this permanent?” I said.

“For God’s sake!” The woman was so frustrated. She threw the pile of comics at me and stormed up the steps of the basement. I heard her clomp over the floor above my head. My front door opened, shut. 

I gathered myself. Had I been dosed? An accident? Malicious. I looked at my hands. Touched my face. Pinched myself (stupid I know). Slapped myself. I was still in my basement. So that was good. I knew schizophrenics could imagine people talking to them. 

I stood and headed to the stairs. Before I could rise, I heard my front door open upstairs, and footsteps clomp over the floorboards. The woman appeared in at the top of the stairs, carrying my particularly attractive neighbor, who I will call X for anonymity.

X was half-conscious. The woman dragged X down the stairs by their feet. CLUMP CLUMP CLUMP!

At the bottom the head made a particularly sickening thump. Next the black-clad woman pulled from a hidden pocket an implement (I really don’t want to go into details about these things. It’s not my purpose to explain how to do them. I’ll leave it to your imagination.)

Suffice to say, as she used the implement upon X the screams of agony were deafening. The woman quickly stuffed in a nearby cloth from the floor. X’s eyes were wide in disbelief at this sudden change in circumstances.

I was shaking. After years of fake images and thoughts, this was the real thing. I wasn’t sure how to feel. 

Then the black-suited woman did something that changed my life. She took the implement and repeatedly stabbed it into X’s crown. I watched hypnotized as the skull gave way beneath X’s hair and caved in. 

The woman lifted the head and beckoned to me.

Adrenaline and fear pumped through my body. When would the police come? Was I really seeing this? Was I an accomplice? Wasn’t this what I’d always wanted to see? Who am I? (Etc etc you get the idea – I Mean if I seem incoherent, please imagine yourself in this situation).

I hesitantly crept forward. The woman lifted the head so I could see inside. And I saw….nothing. The skull seemed empty? Then the woman did her thing. She grabbed my right wrist with her black-gloved hand and violently shoved it inside the skull cavity.

I tried to pull away but couldn’t. But I had enough sense to feel no resistance to my hand as I must have (subconsciously) detected. As I fell backwards…this did slowly register in my brain.

“When you come through the mirror,” the woman said slowly – as if talking to an idiot child, “the world is just like the one you left but people only act as if they can feel. They have no real sense. They are acting out reflections of the people in the real world. The other side of the mirror.” 

It seemed pointless to question the reality of something that felt so real to me. I decided, perhaps helped by the insistent adrenaline, to go along with things temporarily until something better came up. “So one here can feel anything, even if they act like they feel it?”

“Hurrah!” the woman cheered, “finally Einstein gets it.” And with that she was gone. 

I was alone in my(?) basement. With a brainless corpse of X. I didn’t want to be with the brainless corpse of X. I mounted my stairs. At the top I headed straight to my bedroom to lie down and clear my head. 

As I opened my door I heard a familiar voice, “Hello?” I peeked through the hinge crack in the door and saw (oh for God’s sake) myself, in bed, looking around fearfully.

I backed away. It all clicked. This was consistent. It was real. I might be creative in the sense that all sadists are emotionally creative relative to normal people, but I wasn’t creative enough to imagine a scenario like this. This was not schizophrenia. 

But I was not ready. 

I scampered down to the mirror almost silently. I pulled X’s body into a dark corner behind some stored items. Then I touched the mirror’s surface. Immediately the woman’s head popped out of it and I had to cover my mouth to stop me from screeching in surprise.

I won’t bore you with the return journey. But suffice to say I soon lay on the floor of my original basement. I grabbed the mirror and turned it to face the wall. I pulled open the wardrobe. My magazines had text all the right way round!

That night in my (thankfully empty) bed I pondered. Sebastian called for our regular evening chat but I didn’t pick up. 

All these years I had gained such joy from imagining the suffering of others. But was it really the suffering? Could it be that I could gain the same joy from watching the suffering of people who weren’t actually FEELING pain but were acting as if they did? 

It was certainly worth a try. 

And so it was that I found myself back on the other side of the mirror. This time there had been no lady in black. I had found my way into the door of light in the water with ease. On my back was a backpack of…”tools”.

I had a plan. Actually I’d had such plans for years. It was part of my rituals. When you can’t bring yourself to harm others, the next best thing is to hatch movie-like plans for how you’d stalk or capture or trap them, and what you’d do to avoid criminal proceedings. Of course I never did it – I’m too highly moral.

X had been one of my “pretend victims” but obviously X was not an option now. Thankfully I had others. Who presumably had mirror images here. I won’t bore you with the details of my stalking plans. But I found someone. 

I came through the mirror on a Saturday night, when all the pretty people go downtown. There’s a small lane there with a dark and hidden byway. I stood there as I’d imagined standing there so many times before. I know Sebastian had too. We had talked of how it could be our Yellow Brick Road.

But this night I actually smelled the wet rainfall left on the pavements. I actually heard the tinkling laughter of others, the music in bars in the distance. And I could feel the adrenaline as the footsteps of a lone person made their way up. And oh. They were beautiful.

But let me take a moment to explain something. 

I feel you’re judging me. I feel you need to know why I desire to watch suffering. It’s really not so evil. 

When I imagine cutting an attractive person’s throat, just a tiny slit with a razor blade, it feels like I finally can connect to the deepest part of myself, beneath my brain. Their imagined pain, fear, the destruction of their perfect skin I desire so much, it opens up a communication way. I am one. I am integrated with my own terror of suffering and rejection, and my childhood fears that I cannot bring to consciousness. 

I no longer have to fear the weed and tentacles that rise up from the depths to torture me in an eternal scream of unimaginable agony, because I am that creature now. I am safe. 

It feels so good. So what I need.

And that…pretty much sums up that night. Imagine my surprise when I realized I felt the connection doing these things to a person who had no feelings, a mirror person. Imagine my surprise when I realized I could do the things I’d been imagining for so long. That I was capable of such actions. Imagine my…

-

I am back on the other side of the mirror, where the magazines have text the correct way round. I am lying on my bed feeling at one and satiated in a way I never have before. I am complete. I am real. I feel so real. 

Sebastian calls, but I don’t need him anymore. 

I have a whole world.

And for the next few days, I spend every night in that world. Oh I can’t tell you. What I see in peoples’ eyes. Real or not. I feel so close to them at last. To myself. 

So is this a happy ending? 

It could have been, it should have been. But one evening, and a particularly beautiful evening, I stood in that dark lane. I had not even bothered finding anyone tonight. There was a light warm rain and few people were out on a weekday night.

But to stand there and feel free, was all I needed. I looked up at the clouds. The Moon just visible as a glow, it was a full moon. And everything went black with a flash of agony.

-

I have never been forcibly concussed before, so I was very surprised by quite how painful it was. My head ached so hard I almost vomited. I could hardly open my eyes with the pain the light caused me.

I was in the back of a motionless van. It took a while to recognize it, but I was so relieved when I realized. I must have collapses and been helped by….

Sebastian! My beautiful savior opened the back doors of the van and light streamed out onto him. Of course I quickly realised this was not Sebastian but the mirror Sebastian. However I knew he would still ACT as my friend, even if he didn’t feel it.
I tried to thank him. But could not. I only then realized I was gagged. Before I could explain Sebastian spoke to me. He sounded so happy.

“Holy shit! What joy! It is you!” he said, “I can’t believe my luck.”

I smiled beneath my mask. MMMMPH MMPH, I said.

Sebastian climbed in closed the door and took from his pocket a…well I’m sorry to say a tool. 

“You see after I hadn’t heard from your real self for a while, I came to his house and searched everywhere!” 

He inspected the tool, caressed it. I got a funny feeling. MMPH! MMMPH! I cried

“In the basement I found this mirror, and oh…I don’t know why I’m bothering to tell you this, except perhaps it might scare you more, I found a”, he giggled, “MAGIC MIRROR!”

I was indeed scared more. Horrified is perhaps a better word.

“You real self has a magic mirror. Jesus Christ! And then I touch it, and I met this woman in black, and blah blah blah blah…but you don’t need to know this. Suffice to say, my best buddy has found a way to act out what we’ve both imagined for so long!”

Sebastian was sweating with joy. I was sweating for other reasons. Trembling too.

“But I’ve gotta tell you a secret,” he leaned in and whispered in my ear. “My biggest fantasy’s been to do my best buddy. All this time! Can you imagine!? I’m so embarrassed. But, you won’t tell him will you.”

By this point I was crying with terror. I may have wet myself. I moaned. No words.

“And to be honest, I’m probably doing him a favor getting rid of his mirror self. It’ll free him up in here. We can have so much fun!” He sat back for a moment and a serious look came onto his face.

“But I want you to know, and I’m very serious about this, I never NEVER would do this to him for real, of in fact to any real human. But with you…”

He leaned forward and tapped my trembling sweating head, “She showed me what’s in these mirror heads, so you’ll feel nothing. Which…believe me is gonna be a blessing. Because…” he stroked his tool, “I’ve been imagining this for years. And you’re the only mirror version of him, so I am going to make this last a long long time, and I’m going to do things to you I could never bring myself to do to a human being who could feel the suffering.”

“I wish there was a God. A good. A happy ending. A heaven. But there isn’t- all we can do is try to connect, to ourselves. When I see an attractive person in agony, it is like an intimate moment. We connect. Why do you think people are embarrassed to suffer deeply? They did a study and found that the deeper the suffering one member of a couple saw in another, the more like the suffering person would leave the couple out of embarrassment. They never wanted anyone to see them that vulnerable. That animal.”

“If an attractive person won’t have me to love and be loved, a moment of intimacy, at least we can have the intimacy of them driven to unbearable animal suffering. Their fluids on the surface. Covering them with red. Proof of life. Proof of life.”

I think I’d peed and defecated myself by this point.

“My friend and I have raised this to an art in our imaginations. Let me tell you what I’m going to do to you. Because the suffering your face will show as you imagine your own future suffering is an exquisite aperitif for the rest of tonight’s physical exertions. Let me tell you everything that’s coming.”

And he leaned in, put his mouth to my ear, and told me it all.
