I’m crouched under the table, Ethan’s blood soaking into my jeans. It’s warm. Sticky. Metallic.

I don’t know how I ended up like this—trembling, breath caught in my throat, eyes fixed on the body next to me.

I peeked once. Just once. His eyes were still open. Staring.

And now I can’t stop seeing them.

This was supposed to be a fun sleepover.

Jake called me this morning at 8 AM, his voice crackling like static.

“Come to my uncle’s place. We’ll have a blast,” he said.

But something was off—not nervous, just… empty. Like he was reading from a script.

I ignored it. Laughed it off.

Stupid.

When I arrived, the house loomed ahead, a monstrous silhouette against the dim twilight, its windows glowing like dull, jaundiced eyes. The jungle pressed in around it, leaves whispering in the wind, the air thick with the damp scent of earth and something else—something waiting. Beautiful, but wrong.

A man in a crisp suit swung the door open before I could knock. "You must be Jake’s friend!" he said, his smile stretching a little too wide, voice smooth as polished wood. "Come on in." His eyes didn’t match his cheer—dark, unblinking. Like a doll’s.

I stepped inside, the floorboards groaning under my weight.

"Your friends are on the second floor," he said, gesturing toward the staircase with a gloved hand. "You’re the last one here."

I forced a laugh. "Well, I’ve got a great track record of being late."

His smile vanished. "Being late shouldn’t be a flex," he said, cold and sharp. The air turned heavier, like the house itself was holding its breath. Without another word, he pointed up the stairs. "Second floor, then left."

I followed him deeper into the mansion, the flickering yellowish light casting long, wavering shadows across the walls. It felt like stepping into an old painting—the kind where the air smells of aged wood and candle wax, where every creak of the floorboards whispers of forgotten stories. For a moment, the grandeur wrapped around me, and in my mind, I was a king striding through his palace.

Then I reached the room where my friends waited. I saw them—Ethan, Phil, Luke, Jake—lounging like nothing was wrong.

Laughing. Teasing. Grinning like they were still alive.

And for a moment, I grinned too.

I didn’t know it was the last time I'd see any of them smile.

"Hey!" Ethan called, his familiar grin cutting through the strange heaviness in the air. "We’re never on time, are you?" His voice, warm and teasing, tugged a smile from me despite everything.

Phil rolled his eyes. "Pretty sure we barely made it ourselves, so don’t even start."

"Jake," Luke chimed in, nudging our host, "you should’ve called them an hour earlier."

"Yeah," Jake agreed, smirking. "Then they might’ve actually showed up on time."

I glanced around the room—spacious, with a massive four-poster bed dominating the center. My friends lounged on it like lazy royalty, their laughter bouncing off the high ceilings. I dropped onto the mattress beside Ethan, the fabric cool beneath my palms. "So, what’re you guys talking about?"

Before anyone could answer, Jake’s uncle spoke from the doorway, his voice smooth but deliberate.

"You should play hide and seek."

Under normal circumstances, suggesting a game of hide-and-seek to a bunch of high school boys would’ve earned eye rolls or jokes. But his next words silenced us:

"You’ll hide. I’ll find you. The winner gets a prize from me."

A gift? That changed things. Maybe I’d judged him too harshly. The tension in my shoulders eased—just a little.

Then I noticed Jake’s smile never reached his eyes—it was like a mask, tight and unconvincing. But I brushed it off. Maybe I was overthinking things.

We all scrambled off the bed as his uncle announced, "Go! I’ll count to 100, then come looking for you!"

Jake added, his voice edged with something sharp, "Try not to get caught."

Ethan grinned, stretching his arms. "Catching me in this giant mansion? Impossible."

Luke nodded. "Yeah, let’s see who wins."

The uncle’s lips curled. "Don’t be so overconfident. I know this old building better than the palm of my hand."

I couldn’t resist. "Well, I’m pretty sure you don’t know exactly how your hand looks."

The others burst into laughter—except Jake. His expression stayed hollow, his fingers twitching at his sides.

"Alright, start!" the uncle barked, closing his eyes. "Go hide!"

Like children, we scattered.

I ducked under the massive dining table, its polished wood pressing cold against my back. Ethan was in the same room, tucked behind a door—his favorite trick. I’d known him forever; he loved hiding in obvious spots, then trailing the seeker the entire game. Risky, but it always worked.

The uncle’s counting boomed through the halls. "99… 98… 100!"

Silence. Then—footsteps. Heavy, deliberate. He was searching the second floor, his shoes thudding against the creaking floorboards.

Suddenly, a laugh rang out—Phil’s. But before the sound faded, a deafening bang split the air. Like a gunshot.

My muscles tensed, ready to bolt, but Ethan’s hand shot out, gripping my wrist.

"It could be a trap," he hissed.

But it was too late.

The footsteps halted. Then—running. Fast, frantic. Down the passage, down the stairs, straight toward us.

Ethan’s breath hitched. He hadn’t believed anyone could hear us from that far away.

The uncle strode into the dining room, his polished shoes clicking against the hardwood floor. True to his nature, Ethan crept forward, trying to slip behind him—but the man whirled around with unnatural speed. From my hiding spot beneath the table, I saw their legs twist in a macabre dance, then freeze.

Then—bang.

The sound punched through the air, and Ethan crumpled. His body hit the ground with a sickening thud, his face turned toward me, eyes wide and unseeing. Blood pulsed from the wound in his chest, a dark tide spreading across the floorboards, creeping toward my shoes. The metallic stench filled my nose, thick and suffocating.

He’s dead. Ethan’s dead.

My throat locked around a scream. I pressed my fist to my mouth, tasting salt and terror. The uncle didn’t even kneel to check. He just stepped over Ethan’s body, his shoes leaving scarlet prints as he walked away—back to the hunt.

I couldn’t stay in that room—not with Ethan’s body cooling on the floor, his blood sticky under my shoes. Every breath tasted like copper and dread. I had to move.

Crouching low, I slipped into the hallway, my knees trembling as I crawled toward the bathroom. The door was slightly ajar. Inside, I found Jake—the Jake, the one who’d invited us all here—curled in the bathtub like a frightened child, his face buried in his hands.

"Jake," I whispered, gripping his shoulder. "What the hell is happening?"

He didn’t answer. Just rocked back and forth, his nails digging into his scalp.

Another gunshot cracked through the mansion. Luke’s scream tore through the air—sharp, then abruptly silenced.

Now it was just us.

I shook Jake harder, my voice raw. "Tell me!"

He looked up, tears streaking his face. "I’m sorry!" he sobbed. "I didn’t mean it! I’m sorry!"

His wails were too loud. Too loud.

I barely had time to lunge behind the door before the footsteps came—heavy, deliberate. The knob turned.

Jake was still crying when the uncle appeared in the doorway. He didn’t hesitate. The gun roared, and Jake slumped forward, a dark hole blooming between his shoulders.

My legs gave out. I collapsed against the tiles, my vision swimming.

The uncle wiped blood from his cheek with his sleeve, then smiled down at me. "Congratulations," he said, cheerful as a game-show host. "You win!"

I couldn’t speak. My body was ice and fire, every nerve screaming.

He leaned in, his breath reeking of gunpowder. "Now," he whispered, "call your friends for a sleepover."

I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out. I just... nodded.
