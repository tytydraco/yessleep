The house looked.. Different from when I remembered it. It was clean, not lived in. it looked almost new, but something felt off. It was the complete opposite to what it looked like on the outside. We walked around for a while, and soon realised the house was completely devoid of normal household objects. No paintings, potted plants or books. Just brand new, unused furniture. Sam proposed we split up, but me and Aidan agreed that we were much too scared to explore on our own. The second floor of the house was even stranger. It was the same clean, untouched place, but this time there were odd things like doors that lead to nowhere, rooms with no roof that lead straight into an empty attic, rooms that looked identical and to top it all off, it felt so much bigger than it looked on the outside. We couldn't find anything of interest in the house, so we made our way down the stairs to leave. But as we got to the bottom of the stairs, I caught something out of the corner of my eye. There were scuff marks on the floor. There was someone else in the house. Aidan and Sam had seen it too, but Aidan had also seen something else. We were all frozen with fear on the staircase, trying not to make a sound. Sam eventually worked up the courage to walk to the back door to leave. We heard a gasp from the room he went to as we followed. The glass was no longer broken, and the door wouldn't open. Sam tried to bang on the glass, but it wouldn't break no matter how hard he tried. 



“Maybe we should try the front door?”



I proposed, trying to keep my composure. Aidan went to the front door to try it whilst me and Sam continued to try and break the glass, to no avail. Aidan came back a second later, fumbling with his pockets. It seemed like he forgot his notebook. He couldn't communicate. He dragged me to the door to show me that it was locked, and to make matters even worse, the windows in the room next to the door seemed to have disappeared. I started to panic, as we frantically began looking for an exit.



We all looked through different doors that led to different rooms which led to more doors. It was like a labyrinth. A maze with seemingly no end. We were split up, sorted into rooms that weren't there when we had first entered. The house seemed to be changing. The rooms inside were getting more and more deteriorated and dirty as I went on through the doors. I kept running. Desperate to find an exit. Eventually, I was no longer running through furnished rooms, they were.. Unfinished, tattered. The walls were stripped of plaster, showing the same pipes and wires from the abandoned house we had been at previously. I kept running. The floors slowly filling up with the rotten, muddy liquid just like the other house. Wading through the water, I fell through one of the doors into a large, open room with the walls covered in doors. The water spilled through the room I emerged from. As I got up to gather my senses, I saw 2 silhouettes sitting in the corner.

Sam and Aidan.

I began to walk over. Aidan was curled up in the fetal position, breathing heavily. His face had the stubble of a beard beginning to grow, and his eyes bloodshot.



“Is he okay?” I asked, my voice trembling more with each word.



“I've only been here about.. 5 minutes. He was like this when I found him. He can't communicate. Nothing to write with, or on. He looks.. Old. or at least older.”



Sam got down on one knee to get a closer look and said



“Torn clothes.. His feet are dry despite all the.. Stuff. He's been here for far longer than us.”



We helped Aidan to his feet and I noticed something. The skin under his torn clothes had been scraped. Something had clawed at him. We helped him to his feet and he shrugged us off. I looked around the room, only to find the doors me and Sam came through had disappeared, and there was an open door in between where they had previously stood. Aidan began to walk toward it. We followed closely behind, down the dark, misty, disgusting hallway that lay ahead. 



We walked in silence for what seemed like hours. I felt the presence of something looking over my shoulder the entire way, but I didn't dare turn around. It was cold. Cold enough to see my own breath. The creaking of the rotting pipes above us sounded like something was inside of them. Following above us. Waiting for the right moment. We came to a turn, then another, and another. Left, then right, then left again. It felt like we were walking through the same hallway over and over again. I began to leave torn bits off my shirt behind, just to be sure. Sam shot me a look of concern. I could tell he thought the same as me. Aidan kept walking and walking. His pupils dilated, head empty of all thought. We followed for as long as we could. It seemed as though days had passed. Eventually my knees gave out, I was broken. I couldn't bear to stand any longer. Sam waited with me, as we watched Aidan walk mindlessly off into the darkness. We called and cried after him, to no avail. He was gone. And it felt as though a piece of me was too. 



After I was finished sulking on the cold, stone floor, I built the courage to turn around. There was a door. The same door we set out from days ago. I broke down again. This couldn't be happening. I didn't even know what was real anymore. Sam began to walk toward the door. Pulling myself up, I followed behind him. The deafening silence that filled the halls was soothed as I entered. The sound of a single fluorescent light bulb shattering the unbroken quiet. Along with the sound of something that didn't belong. Crying. The soft crying of a woman. She was sat in the corner of the room. Dark, dirty, grey clothes. Long, dark, wiry hair. Her voice, her crying. It was familiar. I bent down and gently put my hand on her shoulder. She suddenly turned around in fear. It was May. Her eyes were not as bright green, her hair was longer, bruises and infected cuts lined her gaunt face. She lurched toward me and hugged me. We both began to cry. She hadn't noticed Sam yet, but when i looked over all he gave was a smile, just as i expected. We talked for a while about the things we've seen down here. May had only been down here a few hours, and she woke up like this. I asked Sam if he managed to get any supplies that could treat her wounds when he went into his house that time. He half smiled and said he didn't. I didn't believe him. His parents were both police, there's no way they just had an empty house. Eventually we gathered our strength and continued walking, hoping, praying to find Aidan. Or find his corpse at least.
