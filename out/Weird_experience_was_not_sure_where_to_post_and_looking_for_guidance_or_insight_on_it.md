I had a very strange experience recently that I cannot stop thinking about. 

Background: I have known my entire life that I am part Taíno (Arawak) from my dad and on my mom’s side I knew we were indigenous but never knew what tribe until recently. Growing up, my grandparents would say things here and there but would never go into deep detail about our history due to their own traumas. 

One of my aunts and I did the ancestry testing years ago and It said that I was \~30% indigenous - Mexico but mostly highlighted TX and a small portion of Northern Mexico. 

Also, maybe important just for the animals involved in this, I live in a farm town in western NY near Seneca Nation. Lots of land and some protected forests around so we do get a lot of deer/small game/occasionally a bear. The only dogs nearby other than our own are my neighbors but they are small and no one has brought in more dogs to my knowledge. We don’t really have strays around here either.

Last thing, my culture is very important to me, both sides. I am coming to Reddit in hopes to learn and make sure I am learning respectfully. I am spiritual and pray to God/The Creator and my spirit guides daily and grew up strongly connected to and respecting nature.

Side note: I have been trying to google more to learn about the Kickapoo and culture because I would like to pass anything and everything down but I am finding it difficult to find anything other pre - colonization (would love advice on a good way to go about learning more if anyone could help with that too).

So about a week or so ago I had a dream about my aunt who passed away unexpectedly last year. She came to me with a man who seemed modern but he was wearing orange and white beads and had a beaded headband with 2 eagle feathers sticking up in the back. He smiled at me, waved, got into his car and drove off. I didn’t recognize him and I do have other family who had passed but they were bald and this man had long beautiful braided hair. Anyway, my aunt gets into my car with me and I am just looking at her in awe like I really just couldn’t believe that I was seeing her again and it felt so real. Then I woke up. 

A few days later I was driving home at night and was crossing a bridge that had a little bit of brush overhang. Out of the brush, the most beautiful fox I have ever seen jumped out near the road. It startled me when it appeared out of the brush like that but it quickly turned and jumped right back into the brush as I passed. I only mention this because I have lived here a few years and drive around a decent amount but have never seen a live fox. I didn’t think much of this.

The next day I was sitting outside and a hawk/owl flew from the woods directly into a fence across the yard from where I was sitting. It was too far to tell what it was for certain but I did see the wide spread wings and belly was white with small black spots. It only stayed there for a second and when it flew up into a nearby tree I could see the back was more of a dark brownish color. I kind of thought this was weird if it was an owl just because I do hear an eastern horned owl a lot outside of my window at night but have never actually seen an owl, especially not in the middle of the day.

The day after that I decided to reach out to my mom to tell her my dream and asked her to reach out to my grandma to see if she could remember any tribe name. My grandpa passed away last year and I felt like my grandma has been more open lately to talk about our heritage and culture. My grandma remembered that her mom’s adoptive mom was Kickapoo. The fact that my grandma, biological great grandma, and my non-bio great grandma were born in the same place in TX + my DNA results make me assume that my biological grandma was also Kickapoo. 

That night I prayed for God/The Creator to give me signs or to help my spirit guides give me undeniable messages to see if I was on the right path. 

The next day I was outside all day sitting with our dogs. Around 6pm it was still daylight but cloudy and the one I call my familiar (literally my little shadow) runs to our back fence. Looking straight beyond the fence there are open farming crops, left side of the fence is thick brush and trees. He was barking and wagging his tail like crazy so I assumed a deer was back there. It was starting to rain so I didn’t hurry over but he was acting like he wanted to jump through the fence he was so excited so I sped up a bit to see past the brush thinking our neighbor was there. I start to walk back and about halfway I realize there’s what looks like a big, dark gray almost black, thing moving straight towards the fence slowly. I say “thing” because my mind was just not putting together what it was at first. I was about 10 - 15ft away and I just froze. I didn’t feel a sense of dread or scared really, more like confused trying to figure out if this was a dog or why it was so disorienting to look at? My husband had caught up and ran past me to grab our dog and as soon as he passed me, what I assume was a coyote, slowly but without pausing or flinching turned to the side with the brush and then we couldn’t see it since the brush it thick this time of year. It moved pretty normally just slow. I also need to mention that our other little dog had followed me and was standing right next to me the whole time and she is usually with our other dog or my husband but it was like she didn’t even notice the coyote or care that we were yelling. Very odd.

We grabbed the dogs and walked back inside. I immediately asked my husband what he saw and he said he wasn’t sure either but maybe a coyote. He was also very chill about it and wanted to go back out to see if he could still see it but I asked him to just try to look from the house, didn’t see it again. My first thought was that it was a Greyhound because that’s the exact coat length + color + lanky body it had but it was definitely smaller than that. Too big to be a fox or at least bigger than the one I had seen on the bridge. 

Later on I googled and found coyote/wolf hybrids are pretty commonly sighted around our area and the size of those would make sense but I think it may have had mange because the tail was very lean and the coat was not fluffy, all I remember was short gray on the parts of the body I could see.

The most unsettling thing is that neither of us can remember seeing the head/face. Not that it wasn’t there but it was almost like it was tucked between the front legs? Maybe it was tracking/smelling the ground and we just didn’t notice because we were focused on getting the dogs away or we just dont remember looking at it. All I remember was the body, legs, and tail because it was tucked between the legs the whole time. No wagging, no growling, just a slowly steady walk and turn to walk the other direction. Even if that was the case, why wouldn’t it react to our dog or my husband running towards it? I would think it would at least startle or pick its head up.

Anyway, I post this for insight because I’m not quite sure how to look at it. I asked for a sign. Is this it? If so, should I see it as good or bad? I know I said my first thought was a coyote but my second I won’t say. As I said before, I have not found a lot of the Kickapoo taboos or beliefs on the internet and I know different tribes have different point of views on certain animals/spirits. My gut instinct is that I was being checked on and given a nod to being on the right path but maybe not to take every sign too seriously? My second line of thinking is the fact that I don’t know Kickapoo good/bad medicine and spirits associated with it but I do understand how what I saw could be seen as a bad thing. Any possible insight or advice is welcome and thank you in advance!  


Update: We went on the other side of the fence today just to check around for tracks/hair/etc. Didn’t see much but I did find a small bone by the tree line. Just one and it was super clean and white. I’m almost certain it was a rabbit bone but not sure if the coyote dropped it there or what. There was nothing else around though.
