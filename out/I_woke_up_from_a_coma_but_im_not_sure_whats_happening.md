A couple of years ago, i was in uni. I had a bad habit of drinking, but i never thought it would cause any harm. I was wrong.

My parents are very conservative due to their religion. Good thing i was able to go to another city to start studying, but this led to me drinking even more. Beatrice, my younger sister knew it, but never told our parents since we always kept each other's secrets from them.

My memory is not very reliable here, so i'm mostly telling what people told me about this day, but i was at a party at a friend's house and drank more than usual. I had to go home, and went there with my car, so i started driving it even if i knew it was dangerous. I brought up a friend (Mike) with me in the car too, since he lived near me. I didn't really care about the danger, i did that before and it was fine, surelly this time won't be different. But it was different. We don't know exactly why, but i drove out of the road in a bridge, and the car fell in the river below.

That night i suffered permanent brain damage due to the impact and minutes under water. Mike managed to get out of the hospital in a couple weeks, but i wouldn't wake up, no matter what. Soon the doctors realized that i was in a deep coma, and could stay in vegetative state for years.

My family was told about the possibility of me never waking up, and needless to say it was a shock. Beatrice was still in high school and my parents have been putting a lot of expectations on me. They would make anything, i mean, really anything, to wake me up, but ironically they could not make anything, so i was kept like that for nearly 4 years.

My parents would visit me frequently, always with the same depressed mood. They didn't want Mike to visit me, but apparently he wanted to. There were several events where nurses caught him trying to sneak past everyone and enter my room.

That pattern was, however, broken down a single time, when my mom entered the hospital very happy, saying she found a solution, that she could make all of this end. At the time, my dad and Beatrice were worried that she could want to kill me, or that she was getting mad, but nothing really happened and very quickly things got to the normal. Maybe she was referring to another thing, but she refused to tell anyone what all of that was about.

We don't really know why or how, but i did wake up in a few weeks after that incident. I was really wierd at first, even for the doctors. I literally just woke up as if it was a regular morning. No previous signs of change. It was a sudden, unexpected thing.

I'm not sure that was a normal thing. The doctors said that sometimes people just wake up, just like me, but they still seemed a bit confused, as if i was actually expected to never wake up.

I had to stay in the hospital for some time still, to know if everything was really ok.

My family obviously was extremelly excited to know that i finally wasn't unconscious anymore. Beatrice started to tell me about all of the things she did in these 4 years in the first visit, even already telling me some secrets, like Vanessa, her girlfriend, that had to be kept away from our parents since they would try to find a way to separate them, no matter how good was their relationship. However, my mom didn't seem that excited. She did smile a lot, but I could feel something off.

While i was at the hospital waiting to be able to go back home, i started noticing a few things, but i initially thought it could be just me getting back to reality after so much time in coma.

Even if i spent years in bed, causing muscle atrophy, i didn't feel weak, instead i felt revigorated. I also wouldn't feel hungry when my meal was delayed. I didn't feel tired or sleepy at night, and often would just pretend to be sleeping.

My arms and hands would shake, slightly but consistently. I would suddenly feel a shiver down my spine followed by a strong sensation of cold, as if my whole body was being frozen, and my mouth would pick a terrible metallic taste, just for it to suddenly go back to normal after a couple seconds.

Eventually i got the pass to go home, and as soon as i could i tried talking to Mike, since at this point i knew about all the incidents. My parents didn't let me leave home at first, so i had to lie about going for a walk to see the city and what changed. I had already messaged Mike and he really wanted to see me in person, not just by the phone.

As soon as i got to the coffee shop he suggested, he jumped out of the chair and hugged me strongly.

\- "Oh my f\*\*\*ing God, you are actually alive!!!"

I don't know why, but i felt unconfortable with that sentence.

\- "I... I guess i am."

We spent the following hour or two talking, mostly about Mike's life and what happened during these years. At some point he asked me:

\- "Do you think you'll be able to ever drink again? I mean, I coudln't drink any alcohol after that day."

I didn't really know what to answer. My rational side agreed that after what happened i shouldn't drink anymore, but i didn't feel scared about it happening again. I thought for a couple seconds and answered, jokingly:

\- "Well, i didn't drink any alcohol during this time either."

He clearly noticed the delay, and me avoiding to actually answer the question, but laughed at the joke.

It started getting late, so we decided that this was enough for the day. He went home and i actually decided to go to a bar. Mike's question really left me wondering, so i wanted to see if i could drink.

I asked for a shot of vodka. After staring it for a while, waiting to see if any fear would emerge, nothing really happened, so i just drank it. Strangelly, it didn't burn as much as i expected. After a couple minutes, i didn't feel any effect. I asked for another shot, but again, nothing really changed. This was very wierd to me, since even before the accident when i was a heavy drinker, two shots were enough to at least start feeling something, but now, after 4 years of abstinence i wouldn't feel any difference.

After this i just decided to go home. I was reasonably far, and on foot, so i shouldn't waste more time.

At home, my parents were already worried, telling me i should have gone back earlier. While i was lying about what i've done, i said i went to Leo's Burgers, a crappy restaurant that we used to go when i was in high school. My dad interrupted me and said that the place closed last year. My mom took a deep breath and asked me if i was with Mike. I couldn't really answer, since i got nervous pretty quickly.

She just left the room and went to the bedroom. I was expecting some huge thing, yelling at me for that, but she didn't. She did seem very angry, but the lack of action was wierd. My dad did the discourse i was expecting, and decided to go to talk to mom.

Beatrice looked at me with what i can only describe as sad and sorry. She always did that when our parents were mad at me, as if she wished that it was her instead of me, so i could still be ok.

I also went to bed, and started pretending to sleep. After a couple hours, i heard my door opening, and after some time, closing.

After that, i heard whispers coming from the living room, that was in front of my bedroom. It was faint, but i could still hear it.

I tried to understand it, but it was hard to pick even a single word. I did noticed that it was my mom's voice tho. After some time she started singing, still very softly. I also picked up a smell i don't know exactly how to describe. It was similar to smoke, but also with a trace of rotten eggs and... maybe blood? I'm not sure, i never felt that smell before. However it was very weak. Maybe it was not even there.

Eventually she stopped. It felt akwardly silent after all that sh\*t.

I wasn't sure if that really happened. Doctors did told me i had brain damage. Maybe this means i could be experiencing things that aren't really real.

In the following morning, i tried talk to her about that, but before i could say anything about it, she was giving me "good morning", as if the Mike thing on the day before hadn't happened. I just decided not to bother talking about, since at this point i was not even sure about that whole thing happening.

My dad was still somewhat mad, and that actually made me feel a bit better. Maybe i wasn't hallucinating completelly yet.

I tried messaging Mike to ask him about this, but he didn't answer. I was not even sure he got the messages.

I decided to ask Beatrice about the behaviour of my mom, but she said she didn't notice anything like what i described.

After a few days a former uni colleague told me that Mike died. He had a heart attack. That's why he never recieved my messages.

I was deeply intrigued by that, and immediatelly remembered the wierd behaviour of my mom on that night. This was a Sunday, so she and my dad would go to the church. I decided to ask Beatrice to help me look on our mother's things. She wasn't really believing me that anything was wierd, but agreed.

After some time searching on her books, i felt sonething wierd about a particular one. The cover said "Alternative methods of prayer for the sick". It had a dark, brown cover, as if it was a bible or something.

\- "What about this one?" I said.  
\- "Seems extra boring."  
\- "Yes, but... I don't know, "the sick"? Like me?"  
\- "Ugh, ok then."

The pages were thin and slightly yellow. It seemed mostly like a book to get money from people in bad situations, giving useless advice for multiple sickness. However, as we passed for more pages, things started going increasingly daunting.

At some point it had an image with text written in a language i don't know. I tried quickly looking up online different languages and how they looked, but none seemed to match that.

After that, some paragraphs starting also be in that same script, and eventually the whole thing was covered with symbols i have never seen, and didn't seem to be from any language i could find online.

Later, there was a page with a drawing, almost a painting, of a group of people dancing around a skeleton. This skeleton is standing up, dancing too. In another, someone being stabbed in the chest by a unsettling figure. This figure didn't seem have a human head, but instead it was more similar to a goat.

Beatrice was visibly scared. She gave a few steps back after seeing this last image. I wasn't really sure how to do after seeing her like that. I tried to think about something to say, but all i could say was:

\- "Let's just... stop messing with mom's things."

She took a few moments to react. She just nodded her head in confirmation, and we started to pack things back to where they were.

I decided to make this message because i have no f\*\*\*ing clue what's going to happen. To me, to Beatrice, to dad. To mom.

I can't even fully understand what's going on.

I think i'm scared too.

This is my first r/nosleep story, so i'd like some feedback.

I'm not sure how obvious it is, but English is not my native language. I hope my mistakes didn't make it unbearable or break the imersion too much.

Also, i took some considerable inspiration from Hereditary.
