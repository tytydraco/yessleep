I’m posting here because I don’t know who else to ask.



I work in museum collections. Most of my job involves stabilizing items and not opening them. I had received a journal a while back; It was catalogued as an “unidentified personal notebook, early 20th century,” stored with a group of trench maps and ration logs recovered during a private estate donation. No name. No notes beyond “found among effects.” The binding is hand-stitched, leather over board, warped slightly as if it had been damp and dried several times. All of our testing says it isn’t a fake. The paper, ink, stitching, and wear all date to 1914. Nothing we can find suggests later alteration, which is why this is so strange.



It came onto my radar because a graduate student needed primary material for a project. That gave me grounds to request a non-invasive scan (angled light, multispectral imaging) so the contents could be transcribed without destroying the spine. I expected either something mundane or a clever fake. 



After reading the first transcript though I expected a novelty or a counterfeit. The language inside felt wrong. You’ll know what I mean when you read it. In disbelief I consulted the test results and put requests in for more, but they all said the same thing: All of our testing says it’s authentic. Every test we ran placed the materials firmly in 1914. Ink, paper, stitching; all consistent. No signs of later alteration.



The content, however, is confusing.



What follows is a transcription of the writing recovered from the initial scan. 

I’ve transcribed what the scans revealed as faithfully as possible so far. I haven’t corrected language or smoothed inconsistencies. 



I’m hoping someone here might recognize something I’m missing.



This is the first entry. I’ve asked for another scan to retrieve material deeper in the page stack but it will take a few days to get the results. This is what I have for now:  
  
  
  
"As soon as I’m healed up I’m going straight to my unit commander and letting him have it. This has been by far the most dangerous and unprofessional troop I’ve ever seen.

Before anyone reads this and assumes I’m confused, I should explain how it normally works. 

War reenactments, just like real war, aren’t about motion so much as position. You don’t charge and run around shooting your gun endlessly. You hold. You wait. You go over the trench when you’re told, and you come back when the whistle blows. It is meticulously rehearsed. The ground is measured. Even the mud is familiar after a while. 



You know where you’re supposed to be. 



We were reenacting the Ardennes, 1914. That was the hook this year. August 21st. Anniversary of first contact. Everyone was excited about it in a way I usually find tiresome. Early war is messy, poorly documented, and full of mistakes people like to romanticize after the fact. Still, the organizers had done their homework. Dense forest, uneven ground, limited sightlines. The real selling point, though, was the eclipse.

Total solar eclipse, scheduled to pass over the region mid-morning. Same date as the original engagement. Rare alignment. Once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. They’d advertised it heavily: *history under the same sky*, that sort of language. 

We’d been rehearsing the battle for weeks. First we’d hump through the woods, emerge onto a plain where a trench had been dug in front of an open recreation of no man’s land. That is where the true battle begins, and the audience would be waiting for us to emerge from the forest.  My unit always takes the same section of trench. There’s a timber brace halfway down with a crack that looks like a lightning bolt. That’s my marker. When we go over, I count the steps from there. We get about halfway into the charge when the eclipse is supposed to reach totality. We were all meant to pause and let everyone take it in, and then when the darkness began to break a German barrage would commence to startle everyone back. It was quite good theatrics in my opinion. 

I’d recently been reassigned to a new troop with a great reputation, and I was looking forward to fitting myself into what they’d already built. They were known for their discipline, tight spacing, clean movement, and no wasted noise. They took the work seriously in the way I respect, not just dressing the part but understanding the rhythm of it. I’d spent the week before watching recordings of their previous events, noting where they held too long and where they rushed. I adjusted my timing to match theirs, shortened my fall so it wouldn’t draw focus, practiced keeping my face slack so the moment would read as finished instead of dramatic. Integration matters. One bad performance can pull the eye and ruin the whole field. I didn’t want to stand out. I wanted to disappear the right way. 

When the day came, it went extremely well, and then it fell apart. We moved efficiently and convincingly, the way the French had in the opening hours of the real engagement, pushing through the forest in dense columns because that was what doctrine demanded at the time. The Ardennes had always punished that kind of thinking. Trees too tight, ground too broken, visibility too poor, but that was the point of choosing it. Early war mistakes are easier to understand when you can feel them in your legs.

We crossed a shallow stream meant to stand in for the Semois tributaries, boots sinking and slipping on the stones. I remember thinking they’d done well to include it. Men cursed quietly, rifles held high, line bunching and then stretching again as we climbed out. That sort of inconvenience sells everything else.

The soundscape was handled better than I expected. Distant artillery, intermittent rather than constant, with long quiet stretches in between. That matched the accounts. Short, violent barrages followed by nothing at all, as if the forest itself had gone deaf. I noted it approvingly. Too many reenactments drown the field in noise. War, especially at the beginning, is mostly waiting. 

By mid-morning we were exactly where we were supposed to be. The light through the trees was steady, late-summer bright, and morale, or what passes for it in these settings, was high. Men joked under their breath. Someone hummed. It all felt controlled, deliberate. Even the mistakes were the right kind. We made it to the trench just as the moon touched the edge of the sun. 

When the light began to go, it wasn’t how I expected. Shadows sharpened, then thinned. Greens dulled. Faces lost contrast. The world looked flatter, simpler. We were still moving and for a brief moment, no more than a breath, the Ardennes went utterly still, exactly as some of the men later claimed it had in 1914. Birds quiet. Wind gone. The colors drained away, sound carried strangely. I remember being pleased. They’d timed it well.

Someone laughed behind me. Someone else swore. The temperature dropped. I checked my footing, found my marker, and waited. For just a moment I felt the ground shake and settle, the way it does when a distant shell lands. The forest seemed to pull inward. Depth collapsed. Distance stopped making sense. I assumed it was adrenaline. People always underestimate how much the body fills in when the senses are disrupted. I tasted something bitter at the back of my throat and swallowed it down, convinced it was nerves. I’d felt it before, just not this strongly. Time slipped. I can’t explain it better than that. Movements came in jerks rather than flows. A man would be in front of me, then suddenly ahead, then back again, as if the moments between hadn’t quite resolved. I hadn’t felt dizzy or sick the whole day. I don’t know if it had to do with the eclipse, my nerves, or something else. I told myself this was just what stress did. This was the body narrowing its field, trimming excess information to keep you functional. If anything, it meant the reenactment was working. 



When the light returned, the barrage started, but things were all wrong.



The barrage started too heavy. Somebody loaded the blanks with way too much gunpowder. They don’t thud like that. They crack, they snap. These impacts had too much weight. The earth shook in a way that rattled my teeth. The smoke didn’t drift. It pooled, thick and low, and when I breathed it in my chest burned like I’d swallowed something sharp. A casing spun near my boot and settled in the mud. It wasn’t brass-colored the way the reenactment blanks were supposed to be. It was duller, darker. I remember thinking someone had mixed batches again. I added Danny the munitions guy to my list of people I was going to have strong words with. I’d expected much more out of this new assignment and to say I was disappointed was an understatement. 

Someone shouted a warning, but it wasn’t one of the calls we practiced. Again, a terrible decision. There was no room for improv in this line of work. The illusion is fragile and must be held with all precision. This troop did not have that. The words blurred together, swallowed by the noise. I was so annoyed that the timing was off; that the organizers had let the spectacle get away from them.



We made it to the trench for the charge, our commander gave the stand by order. Then the charge. 



We climbed the ladders and went over, and immediately the spacing fell apart. Men dropped too early. Others didn’t drop at all. Someone was screaming with way too much gusto. This had to be a rookie because he just let go as if he couldn’t stop himself. It wasn’t the right kind of scream, the kind people think of when they imagine pain. It went on too long without breaking, stayed too high, too loud. Real fear, if it’s done right, stutters. It catches in the throat. You hear it fall apart as the lungs empty. This one didn’t do that. It just poured out of him, raw and undisciplined, like he hadn’t practiced holding anything back.

I remember thinking he should have cut it short. Let the noise taper. Save something for the next pass. When he finally went hoarse, it sounded forced, like he was chasing an effect instead of letting it happen. I looked away, irritated. Overacting ruins the illusion.

As I moved past the amateur, I noticed a man down in the mud a few yards over, both hands locked around his thigh, the rest of  his destroyed leg strewn a few yards away. Fake blood was gushing from his leg and I could see bone shards sticking out. It wasn’t the most convincing prosthesis job I’d seen, but nonetheless I’d believe it ten feet away squinting. I was curious so I got down next to him and found he really didn’t have a leg. I didn’t know they’d started bringing amputees into the roster, but once the idea occurred to me, I had to admit I was impressed.

Someone already missing a leg saves you half the work. You don’t have to fake the movement of it, don’t have to choreograph the awkward fall or worry about the illusion breaking when the body lands wrong. The hard part is concealment before the event; long trousers, careful movement, keeping spectators from noticing the imbalance. If they’d managed that, it spoke well of the organizers.

I gave him a quick slap on the shoulder, half encouragement, half acknowledgment. By then I’d started to lose interest in maintaining the illusion myself. The whole thing was going badly enough that a small break in character didn’t seem like it would matter. Letting him know he was doing solid work felt like the right thing to do.

I tried engaging him but he was so committed to the role he just suppressed a scream and yelled at me to drag him back to the trench. That brought me back to the reality of the situation and I remembered I was still acting. I again patted his shoulder and told him my part was to keep going. I left him yelling curses at me, very committed to the part but I couldn’t indulge him. I had lost my place and I didn’t want to leave the man assigned to kill me hanging. Just because everyone else wasn’t doing their parts right doesn’t mean I shouldn’t. 

I remember thinking I should find him afterward. A performance like that shouldn’t be wasted on a sloppy unit like this. If he could keep that level of control under pressure, he’d fit in well with my troop.

I found my next mark and I moved forward. I counted my steps. I found my place in the churned earth where the earth hole dips just enough to cradle a body.



That’s where I die.



I stood there longer than I should have. The noise kept going. The barrage didn’t pause. I remember feeling exposed, upright while everything else collapsed around me. I wondered if the whistle had failed.



I waited. Nothing hit me.



I remember thinking, absurdly, that I’d missed my cue. That I’d drifted out of position during the push and my shooter had passed me by, hunting for someone else. I was calculating how long I could stand there before I broke the illusion, already convinced it had been too long, that someone had noticed me upright in the open like an idiot. Then a German infantryman stepped out of the smoke. It was so sudden and so clean it felt incredible. He appeared as if summoned, rifle already rising, and for a moment the symmetry of it struck me. I nearly smiled. For everything that went wrong in this reenactment I finally felt this would be a worthy end to my performance. I gripped the tether of the blood bladder on my chest, bracing myself to do it properly. He didn’t hesitate. The shot hit me hard enough that the world collapsed inward. The ground rushed up and knocked the breath out of me in a single violent motion, and everything went black before I could understand what had gone wrong.

The next thing I remember clearly is waking up in a tent with a burning sensation in my chest. My shoulder bandaged and my arm in a sling. In that moment I put together that the live ammunition they were using had made it into the German’s rifle and he had actually shot me. But if that is true, I shouldn't be in a field hospital. I didn’t even know we had a replica field hospital, and this was an odd way to stage it to boot. The canvas walls were fully closed. No sightlines. No access for spectators. What was the point of a medical display no one could see?  I was still deciding which part of this to be angriest about when a man came in wearing a uniform I didn’t recognize and started asking me questions that didn’t make sense.

I told him there’d been an accident. I said someone had used live rounds. I told him I needed to be moved to a real hospital, not whatever this was supposed to be. He told me I was in one. The best they could do.



That’s when I really lost my temper.



I told him to stop playing along. I told him this wasn't an immersive theater and people could get killed by indulging it. I demanded to speak to whoever was in charge. He didn’t argue. He just wrote something down and said he’d be back. That was some time ago. I don’t know how long.  I’m writing this so I have a record of my grievances but also to pass the time. Someone will come back and explain where the mistake was made. Someone will admit they let the realism go too far.



They always pull the curtain back eventually."
