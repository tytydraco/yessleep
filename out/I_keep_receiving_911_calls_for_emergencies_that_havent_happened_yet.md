I know that another call is coming today. I don’t know when and I don’t know why, but it will. They have been the only constant in the chaotic maelstrom of decision and consequence that has been the last few weeks of my life. Oddly reassuring knowing I can look forward to them, yet completely powerless to know exactly when they will occur or more importantly what I should do about them. Any doubt is gone, I have seen too many things to believe it is just some trick or coincidence. I don't want to believe, but I have to now. I know I have a responsibility to do something, I just don’t know what that is most of the time. I am tired and overwhelmed, but someone has to do something and that someone is me. I was chosen to know what will happen and given the burden of stopping it, or just bearing witness. I suppose I understand how ignorance can be bliss now. Sorry, I should elaborate and tell you what has been happening to me these last few weeks, I know it might sound crazy but bear with me.

The first call was two weeks ago. I was just getting off work and had to take care of something that was equal parts annoying and expensive. I needed to pick up a new phone since I managed to completely break my old Galaxy by dropping it the day before. The screen shattered of course, but worse some damage to the internal components completely broke it and it would not boot up or do anything other than display a blank screen.  As I was about to head out to purchase my new device, the seemingly dead phone sprang to life and started ringing. Not with my own ringtone but a strange chime I had not heard before and was not sure if it was even in the list of pre-programed ringtones. I was confused how it could still ring but was momentarily relieved since I figured it might still work after all. I could not really afford anything better at the moment anyway so if I could I would save the expense. Putting aside the decision to keep my shattered phone a while longer or not I answered the call. I was surprised and disturbed when before I could even say hello and panic-stricken voice cut me off.

“Help! Oh God please help someone stabbed him; they stabbed Michael please send help.” It sounded like someone was trying to call the emergency line and somehow it got sent to my broken phone. I was confused and I tried to explain to the distraught person on the phone that I was not emergency services.

“I am sorry, I know it sounds like a real emergency there, but you need to dial 911 and get help I don’t know who this is and I can’t track the location, this is a personal cell phone not 911.”

Before I could try and explain more, I was cut off.

“What do you mean? I did call 911, I need help! Someone stole our car and stabbed my boyfriend, Michael. We need help now! Get a real dispatcher or something please. He is losing so much blood; we need help now! We are near the park on, what was it?” She paused, likely confirming the address.

“We are on 4th Ave and Becket Street I think please send help.” I did not know what I could do. I had tried to suggest they call 911 but they sounded sure that they had. I did not know how to tell the panicked woman that I couldn't help. I finally decided on a plan and told her,

“Alright mam try and stay calm, I will try and call emergency services myself and send them there. Please try and call 911 again over there and see if it routes you correctly so someone can help. What can I tell them your name is?” There was a pause and the voice on the other line spoke again.

“It’s Kendra, Kendra --------Wa-----” Static interrupted her response and after a moment the line went dead. I tried to call 911 but after that call my dead phone had died once again and it was unable to make even an emergency call. I hoped that whoever that Kendra woman was got hold of emergency services. I had no idea how I had gotten the call but either way they really needed help and I sure was not an EMT. I thought they likely got through since I did not get another call, but the more I thought about it the more concerned and responsible I felt. I considered the location she gave. I knew that park, it was not too far from where I was so I figured I would go and check and make sure that they got through to 911 and someone was there on scene to help.

I drove out to the park and found the corner of the park by 4th and Becket. Not many people were around since it was fairly late in the evening. Certainly, no signs of a stabbing or carjacking on this street corner. Since no one was around I started thinking that maybe I had been the victim of a prank and that no one was here. It might have just been some elaborate crank call, meant to rile people up about emergencies for some kind of sick entertainment. I felt upset by being fooled, but also relieved that no one was really in trouble and I decided to head home. The Verizon store was closed by that point, so I would have to try again tomorrow. I stuffed the Verizon coupon I had saved and hoped would help discount a new phone for me back into my pocket. Having scribbled the address that Kendra had given me on the back of the paper I started to feel silly for having gone out there.

The next evening after work I was planning to go buy the overpriced replacement for my phone again. As I got into my car to leave, I fumbled in my pocket for the coupon I had received and had written the address from the prank call the day before on. It was not there. My heart sank, it was a coupon for one hundred dollars off on a new galaxy phone, which considering how much they cost was not a huge percentage and I would have to finance it anyway. Still a hundred dollars was a hundred dollars! I still had a while before the store closed so I decided to check back by the park. I thought maybe I may have dropped it there when I had gotten out to look for the so-called crime scene. It was a stupid idea, I knew that. I figured that unless someone was going to buy a phone, they might not have picked it up and it could still be there.

I drove back to where I had been the previous night. There were more people around this time. A few joggers, some bike riders and people walking the trail. I parked and got out of my car and started looking near where I had been standing the night before. The whole idea was stupid but if it could save me a bit of money I would go for it. As expected, after fumbling around for a few minutes I could not find the paper anywhere and I started walking back to my car. I saw a young couple walking hand in hand back to the parking lot as well. They had arrived back at their car and the gentlemen opened the door for his lady. I thought the gesture was very sweet, which made the next few moments even more horrifying. As he closed the door and started to the driver's side. A figured dressed in all black jumped out of the nearby bushes and shouted at the man. I couldn't make out the words from where I was but he was holding something and when the gentlemen reached into his pocket the figure in black lunged forward and attacked. He seemed to stab the gentleman several times and I heard a scream from the woman who had just emerged from their car. She was still screaming and rushed towards the fallen man and I thought I heard her shout,

“Michael no!”

I stood there frozen unable to act, I knew I should help but I was paralyzed by the sudden brutality and horror of the situation. Before I could move the man in black peeled out of the parking lot in the couple's car. They remained where they were, her screaming continued and she held onto him. The sound had finally snapped me out of my confused and terrified daze and I raced over to try and help. As soon as I approached the woman looked up at me. Her hands were covered in the man’s blood and she begged for help,

“Help call 911, he’s been stabbed my Michael he’s been stabbed!”

I fell back in confused shock; the voice was familiar the name was too. That was the woman from the phone call yesterday. It sounded exactly like her, there was no mistaking it, I couldn't understand how it was all happening in that moment. My confused reverie was interrupted by the woman shouting me back to my senses.

“Don’t just stand there, please we need help!” I did not know how to response but I managed to stutter out a meek,

“My, my phones broken I am so sorry maybe I can find help.” As I backed away trying to figure out what to do a jogger had happened by and raced over to help. She sat down with them and was assisting in stabilizing Michael. She had given her cell phone to the woman who seemed to be calling 911. As she finished dialing the number I felt an odd tingling in the air and suddenly my broken phone vibrated and a notification bell chimed. I sat there dumbly watching everything unfold is disbelief. After a brief delay I heard her speak and I was not prepared, though perhaps I should have been, for what happened next.

“Help! Oh God please help someone stabbed him; they stabbed Michael please send help.”

I felt an odd thrumming of electrical energy from the phone as she spoke and I knew what she was going to say next.

“What do you mean? I did call 911, I need help! Someone stole our car and stabbed my boyfriend, Michael. We need help now! Get a real dispatcher or something please. He is losing so much blood; we need help now! We are near the park on, what was it?”

I unconsciously mouthed the words that followed since I had heard them less than twenty-four hours before.

“We are on 4th Ave and Becket Street I think please send help.”

Another brief pause and then she would say her name. The buzzing and thrumming from the phone stopped moments after she said her name.

“It’s Kendra, Kendra Wallace. Hello? Hello!? Is anyone there? Please send someone, he is going to bleed to death, please!” She continued screaming into the phone and then went back to Michael prone form while the jogger who had come to help attempted to call emergency services again. It sounded like she had gotten through as was giving the location to someone on the phone. When an ambulance arrived, I left the scene. I couldn't handle the insanity of what I had just experienced. How in the hell did I get a phone call about all of the things that had happened that night, the day before?

I fell into my car and gripped the wheel and tried to process the insanity of what had just happened, I had no idea how any of this was possible. As I tried to keep from hyperventilating, I heard another notification on my phone. I had received a text message somehow, despite the messenger app not functioning it had a message screen displayed with one unread message. I tried to see if any other apps or anything would work and it would not navigate to anything else the only thing I could do was to open the thread. It left me even more confused than I had been before the message just read.

“Come on, were you even trying? Better luck next time. See you around  -M”

I had so many questions, chief among them was who the hell was M? And how did they know about what had happened? Before I had time to consider the madness of the situation my phone started to ring again in the same weird chime from yesterday. I had a feeling I knew what would happen if I picked up. Holding my breath and steeling myself, I answered the call.
