I had moved to lovely Brookertown, New Hampshire. It's about an hour from everywhere. As I followed the U-Hauls to my new liar, I noticed how desolate and alone the highway felt. Was I even on the highway anymore? I had not seen a car besides the truck in at least 20 minutes. I was zipping by giant foliage, trees as green as the Jolly green's pecker. Occasionally there would be a dirt road, or a rundown driveway sprinkled into it, but mostly I was surrounded by a massive Forrest.

If I don't sound thrilled about this move, it's because I wasn't. My brother had recently passed away, and I was now the only one able to take care of our ailing grandfather. Grand pappy had lived in Concord all his life, up till his eyesight started to fail. We decided to relocate him a nursing home before he accidentally ran a kid over. He flat out refused, and somehow managed to relocate himself to this middle of nowhere hillbilly town. My brother lived an hour away at the time and decided to move in with the old fart, keep an eye on him. This was five years ago. I had not heard from him since. We were never really that close so it's no real surprise, but when I finally got word of him, that he was dead? I admit my heart sank. So many things I should have said but didn't.

I was also surprised to learn my now 92-year-old grandfather was alive and kicking. He had requested that after the funeral, I come down and spend some "quality time" with him. I knew what this really entailed. I had read my brother's will after all. So, I quit my job and moved to fantastic Brookertown. God what an awful name.

Eventually, I limped into sight of my grandfather's cabin. It looked like something out of R.L.Stine. It was at least three stories; a chipped red paint stained the exterior of the house. The front porch was rotten, barely held up by three, count em, three cinder block support beams. There was even an old-fashioned weathervane on top of the roof. The perfect little lighting rod in the shape of a rooster. I was in awestruck at the state of this firetrap. My brother lived HERE for five years. Richie was always the sort of man to live well above his means, and he settled for this crap-shack? Pappy Roberts must have brainwashed him, that must be it, I thought to myself. I Parked just behind the U-hauls and exited my car wad of 20s in my hand. The moving guys had already begun to move boxes out and into the house. I could hear yelling with a suspicious Southern drawl coming from in the house. The voice was threatening to blast the intruders with his bazooka.

At the time, my grandfather's impossibly Cajun accent was the strangest thing about him. I had no idea why he put it on, he had lived in the north all his life. We were Italian for god's sake. In any case the movers were ignoring the incredulous bastard. Probably dealt with things like that all the time. I saw the driver smoking a cig up near the truck and rushed over to shake his hands and "thank him" and his guys. He took the money and, with a little smirk in his eyes, said.

"Your grand pappy don't really have a bazooka, do he?" He said in a mock accent more fake than my grandfather's.

"Not since the FDA raided the place." I remarked. This got a laugh out of the guy as the whistled to his men to run on out of there. They had really worked fast. As the dust cleared as they sped away from this condemned miss, I hear the *tap-tap-tap* of My grandfather's cane on the porch. I turned around and saw him. As a kid, I always thought pappy was 15 feet tall and had a beard black as coal and smelled like it as well. The man in front of me now completely assassinated my childhood idol. He was hunched over, barely supporting himself on his cane. His beard was patchy, unkempt. His hair snow white and his head covered in liver spots. He wore the same eyeglasses he had when he was a kid, those dorky looking turtle glasses. He was probably blind as three bats, yet I could feel his cataract blues boring into my soul.

"Boy, I know I told ya to call before coming up here. I'm an old man, those men breaking in here like that, I could have keeled over I could have." Pappy Roberts roared at me. I sighed internally and walked up the dirt path to the house to greet him. I couldn't help but noticed how decayed and full of crabgrass the front yard was.

"I did call Pappy, you said you didn't care, and you would probably be dead by the time I got here." I eyed him up and down. "Did you die Pappy?" I immediately regretted that snark as I felt the lighting fast *WHAP* of Pappy's cane against my shin. Ahhhh how I had missed that.

"Now don't you be getting smart with me boy. You get smart with me again you can sleep out here with the Winndys." He remarked, turning his back to me and hobbling back inside. I noted that he was wearing lumberjack overalls and the classic red and black pattern shirt to go with it. I followed him inside and expected to see the place a hoarder's wet dream. Imagine, to my genuine shock, that the place looked pristine. The floor was a beautiful hardwood, gleaming in the morning light. There was a 80, I shit you not EIGHTY inch plasma tv in the living room playing football on surround sound speakers. From the front door I could see the dining room, it looked like Martha Stewart's Garden of Eden. The Kitchen, oh Madone the kitchen was heavenly. He actually had cured meat hanging from the rafters, and a beautiful oven that could fit an elephant inside.

Pappy noticed my slack jawed expression and smiled, in spite of himself.

"You really expect ya old pappy to live like a crazed coon out here, Tyler? I have 18 different streaming services boys." Pappy beamed proudly.

"Why not just get cable at that point, Pappy?" I asked genuinely. He scoffed at that and waved his cane in the air. Ahh Pappy's cane. It was a three and a half foot long oak beauty. The handle was made of pure silver, carved into the shape of a snarling wolf pappy had killed when he was a burly young man. Or so he claimed anyway. I remember when we were kids, when he'd come visit us for Christmas. He'd gather us up around the fire and tell stories. The kind you don't usually tell to eight-year-old kids. He'd weave tales of hairy beasts and horned creatures wailing in the woods. He would always warn us to stay away from the woods at night,

". . .Or the Winndys would claim our voice."

He would always go on about "The Winndys." Tall, elklike creatures that walked like a man yet hungered like a lion. Scared the bejeezus outta me when I was young, now I knew of course that Pappy liked to have his fun with us. I'd probably scare my grandkids like that as well, be a hoot. But I digress. That first night with Pappy was uneventful, save the complaining that I had overcooked dinner.

My room, it turned out, was at least twice the size of my studio apartment and had a router right on the nightstand. It also had a king-sized memory foam mattress. I slept like a baby that night. Or I did, anyway, until I realized that my brother had slept in this same room for five years. Suddenly I felt ill. I sat up in bed and started to gaze out the window. Pappy's backyard was massive, enough room for a small kickball stadium. There was a clear divide between the yard and the woods, the trees just barely encroaching on the neatly cut grass. Why my grandfather tended the backyard so dearly and not the front, is beyond me.

I began to stare into the trees, those lumbering husks of wood, hoping to fall asleep once more. I tried to listen to the sounds of crickets and late night cicadas, until I realized there was none. That struck me as odd, and then I realized there were zero sounds around. No birds, no wind, not even a passing car in the distance. The woods were like an audio dead zone. Shivering a little at the thought, I turned over in my bed and forced myself asleep.

Like I said, first night was uneventful. Next morning I drove an hour and half to find the nearest grocery store and stacked up on about 300 pounds of food. I'm talking fruit, dried fruit, canned beans, the good, sliced cheese, and some good, powdered peanut butter. Pappy was less enthused by my dining choices.

"What is this trash you fill ya body with boy, you should be out hunting. A real man kills his dinner and hunts his desert." He said with a crooked grin. I ignored his oddly perverse comment at the end there and kept stacking the cabinets with the food I had bought. "

Old guy like your pap, still going hunting." I said absentmindedly. "Let me cook you some dinner tonight, I got the good peppers, the good steak." I waved it in his face like he was a bratty child.

"Course I go hunting, once a week. Your brother Jackie went with me." Pappy beamed. There was a glint in his eye, dare I say pride.

"Pfft, MY brother went hunting with ya? Pappy he was a stockbroker. Before he became warden up here anyway. . ." I mumbled that last part under my breath.

"It took some time, I'll admit it. But boy, your brother was one of the best hunters I had ever seen. His passing hurt. Hurt me in a way I hadn't been since ya mutha." There was a sadness now, and I could sympathize. To be 92 years old and outlive your daughter by 20 years has to sting you.

"Been a long time since mom Pappy. You didn't come around much after." I said, facing him now. I leaned against the pristine marble counter for support. I expected him to avert his eyes in shame, but the old bastard stood his ground.

"It was that damn husband of hers, he was always no good, thought he knew better. Forbid me from seeing y'all." He explained adamantly. My scowl still remained, but I had to grant him that dad did hate Pappy's guts. While it wouldn't have surprised me if dad really had tried to stop him from seeing us, I couldn't comprehend the grandfather I remember standing back and taking it.

"Well, past is past Pappy. Now what do ya want for dinner." Dinner was quiet that night, Pappy didn't even complain about the burnt stake. Then we sat in front of the TV and watched *Monster Quest.* I went up around 10pm, Pappy was still sitting there, almost like he was lost in a deep trance. I collapsed onto my bed, exhausted. I drifted off almost immediately, and I wish to God I had stayed asleep. I smelled it before I heard it. It was a rancid smell, like ancient sulfur mixed with decayed flesh. It was wafting in the air from my open window. I sprung up like a leaf and looked around. It was pitch black in my room, only a faint light from the moon outside. But that smell, God it stung my eyes, felt like I was cutting up a sentient onion. I rubbed them awake and stumbled outta bed. When I got up, I heard it then.

"Ty-ler." A voice out from the darkness croaked. "Ty-ler." I Perked up immediately. It....it couldn't be right?

"Richie" I whispered back. My heart clenched up in dreaded excitement. I Rushed downstairs half naked and sprinted to the backdoor. The door was a sliding glass, motion lights turning on from the outside as I approached. The Light was dim, I could just barely see the yard. Giant shadows danced in the darkness, and it took me a second to realize I was staring at the damn trees again.

After a moment of looking at the dead silence, I thought I had simply imagined Richie's voice.

"Ty-ler. Come out and C-Me bro-ther." It was his voice again, from the Forrest. It was almost a gurgle, like he was choking out the words, but it was him damn it. I reached for the sliding door but heisted. I *saw him. I saw him in the casket, his face all. . .*

"Tyler. He-lp Me. Help Me Ty-Ler." The voice groaned from the tree line again. I snapped back into insanity and tore the door open. I was about to run across the yard when I felt a warm but stern hand on my shoulder. It broke me out of my stupor, and I saw Pappy standing there. A somber yet angry look on his face. I was about to ask him if he had heard Richie in the Forrest, but he pointed a bony finger to his lips, shushing me. Then he pointed to the trees. It took me a moment, for my eyes to adjust. Or maybe I just didn't want to believe what I was seeing. At first all I saw were those giant oaks. Then I looked between them. It must have stood at nine feet tall, at least. It was lean and slender, emitting a godawful stench. I could barely make out its head, God help me its head was the shape of a deer, but larger, almost skull-like. It had massive antlers protruding out of its head. I could hear something else then, a warbling sound of some kind. Like a deer, but corrupted, mixed with some kind of reptile. It must have seen me looking at it, and when it discovered I would venture no further, it let out a horrific shriek. Like nails scraping the inside of a car muffler.

Just as soon as I had seen it, it crept back into its woods. More sounds followed it, I could make out three or four distinct sounds like the creature I had seen. I just stood there; it was all I could do not to collapse out of sheer fear. I turned to Pappy, who simply nodded, like he had been expecting them. I stuttered to find the right words to ask him what had just happened, and that old bastard, all he did was smile a toothless grin and say.

"Winndys, boy. There be Winndys in these woods."

I don't remember going back to bed, but I must have. I awoke in a cold sweat, curled in in a fetal position. My comforter scrunched around me like a protective cocoon. It must have been a dream, right? That horrific giant. I struggled to get out bed, my head suddenly pounding. I stumbled down the stairs like drunk sailor. The aroma of fresh bacon filled the air, and in my daze, I saw Pappy flipping that crispy goodness in the air. He was dressed for the day in fine clothing, standing upright even. He seemed enchanted in his cooking, barely acknowledging me at first. He must have noticed me out of the corner of his eye, because he paused, a grin forming on his face.

"Morning boy, eat up and get dressed. We have work to do." He said proudly. I blinked at him like a broken windup doll. The bacon and eggs he cooked were divine to say the least, put my rubbery steak to shame. Pappy ate with gusto, not a care in the word. Meanwhile I sat stunned and confused beyond belief. I swallowed the last of my eggs and pride and cleared my throat and asked a burning question. 

"Pappy did you also see it last night." Pappy nodded.

"Weren't no dream boy, I told ya there be winndys out there." He stated this so casually. "All those stories you told us as kids, they were real." I was flabbergasted. "You thought me a liar boy? I ain't tell a lie my whole damn life. The Grimm reaper would keel over dead before I got caught lying." Pappy proclaimed. He paused, eyeing me.

"It's not about believing me. It's about believing yourself. Come on now, follow me to the basement." he beckoned me, getting up from his seat with a speed one would not expect from an ancient man. I noticed the basement door was already slightly ajar. I blinked and Pappy was already skipping down the steps.

I followed this beckoning enigma of a man down the basement steps. The steps were shag carpet, a relic of a bygone era if I had ever saw one. I peeked my head out from around the corner and saw two leather chairs against a metal stove. I could feel the heat radiating from it from where I was standing. Above it, hung on the mantle with pride were serval stuffed heads. There were elk of course, dead eyed bucks staring out with glassy stares. There were a few fish of various sizes, a rather large black wolf head with beady yellow eyes and. . . What the hell was that?

There were three elk heads mounted in the center, at least I thought they were at first. Their faces were skinless, raw bone covering their heads like armor plating. They had massive antlers, almost cartoonish in length. They curled and coiled around each other like rutting snakes. Each jagged edge could probably maul me a thousand-fold. Their eyes were hollow, I could tell they were there though, buried deep in that skull. Their maws were open, revealing rows upon rows of jagged teeth and long feral fangs. I noticed Pappy had plopped himself down on the largest chair and began reclining in it. His eyes darted to the seat across from him and I limped over to it, more confused than ever. I noticed there were framed photos of Pappy and his hunting buddies. These frayed looks into the past barely caught my eye at first, until I noticed the one on my left. In it,

Pappy was holding up a rifle, a shit eating grin on his face. He was standing defiantly on the body of a hulking beat. Its fur was mangey and spotted, and it had antlers not unlike the ones hanging from the walls. 

"That was a good hunt." Pappy poked his finger towards the photo. " Me, Georgie Walker and Rodeny O'Hara took that photo in the Washinton state national park in 75." Pappy beamed. "Was Georgie's first hunt of any kind really. Took a while for me and Rod to show him the ropes but we taught him well. "I mulled over what Pappy was conveying to me here, and then it hit me like a sack of bricks.

"Pappy are you some kind of mons-" I started before I felt the sharp pain of Pappy's Cain stabbing me in the knee.

 "Now don't be putting ridiculous labels on anything boy. I'm a hunter, always have been. Sometimes the shit I hunted was just bigger than a bear and meaner than seven rabid wolves." Pappy scowled. 

"How does that happen. Whatever you want to call it; it sounds like you were looking for these things." I inquired. Pappy was silent for a moment, a dark expression dwelling on his face. 

"Suppose it started when I was around 15. My pa took me hunting, didn't have a whole lot of fancy gear like they do now a days. Height of buck season didn't see one all day. Darndest thing." He began. "It was dark when we headed back, I had insisted we stay till we killed something. My daddy did like to indulge me." Pappy became misty eyed at the thought of his dad. "I was the first to hear it, that eerie moan echoing in the dark of the wood. It sounded like a dying whale. I was excited, I practiclly ran to get my head chopped off buy my pa stopped me. He held me back and he listened. The wail continued, and stopped just as suddenly had I started. Then we heard a voice." Pappy was lost in thought; his eyes bore past me as he reminisced.

""Hel-p me. Help I been Sh-ot." A shakey voice had croaked out. My father ordered me back to the truck and before I could protest, he smacked me across the head and shouted at me once more. Well, I didn't say no to my pa twice, so I sulked back. It was a quick walk, maybe about five minutes. We both could have made it I think." Pappy pondered aloud. His gaze driffted away, a pained expression in his eyes. I leaned in and gently shook his leg. He snapped back and swatted my hand away, grumbling that he was fine. "Damn boy, can't let your pappy remember in peace, can ya?" He droned on.

"I waited by our old jalopy for what seemed like an eternity. Then a shot rang out, nearly shat myself it was so sudden. After that it was dead quiet again. I called out to my pa. Nothing. I started towards the wood once more, my gun cocked when I heard it. 

"Robert. C-ome here. I ne-ed You're H-elp." My father's voice was shakey and monotonous. It sounded like a broken record. I stood there frozen, as the bushes in front of me started to move. I could smell something rancid, like it had crawled through the septic tanks of hell itself. Once more it called out to me.

"Robert. Come H-ere. Ri-ght now. Listien to Y-our Fat-her." The voice ordered. I could hear malice in its tone now. I raised my gun and told it to stay back. I heard a low grunt, almost like it was mocking me."

I was leaning in now, stupefied by Pappy's tale. He was like a young man again, his demeanor wrapped up in passing on this story. As grim as it was, he was almost giddy to tell it.

 "Did you shoot it Pappy, get it in one blow?" I asked like a dumb kid would. Pappy bellowed with laughter at this.

"I started blasting at the woods, fired bout nine rounds into the brush. Should be dead by all accounts boy, pure luck I ended up hitting the thing." Pappy said sheepishly. "I heard a cry like a dying orca, and it slumped forward, dead on the ground. I had hit it dead center in its throat, thick black fluid pooled at my feet. It was still twitching as I inched towards it. It had a skull like head, antlers jutting out at least my height. Its skin was leathery and worn, patches of matted fur spotted it like it had mange. The skull plate reminded me of a fox, sort of square at the top with a narrow maw. The thing's jaw sported rows of thin teeth covered in dried blood. It turned it's foxed face to me and I could feel whatever eyes it had burn into my soul. I raised my riffle and aimed it at the creature's unholy head. It spoke up once more.

"Atta Boy, son." My father's voice purred to me right before I blasted the winndy back to hell."  Pappy let those words hang in the air, an eerie omen smacking me in the face. Pappy looked down; a mournful look crossed over his face. "Found my dad deeper into the woods. I won't churn your stomach with the details, but I could barely recognize him. I went for help, taking my daddy's cap with me back to civilization. My ma was besides herself of course. Took five men to get that dead thing into the truck when I came back. We took it back to my parent's farm and burned it. Not before I took something from it." He patted his cane affectionally.

For the first time in my life, I really studied the thing. It wasn't jagged or anything but looking at it now, I could see where the nubs had been whittled away. I could see how it was shaved down and painted with a fine wood coating, coating that had faded with time. 

"The handle came later, a gift from a friend, but it made a fine walking stick during hikes." Pappy beamed. "I could have left it at that, it killed my daddy, and I killed it, but ya know what really irks me about the winndys boy" Pappy asked me. I stared at him Blankley. "They took his voice, Tyler. His voice. What came outta that thing's mouth was a mockery. My daddy's voice was gruff, it was bombastic even. When he spoke, you know he meant business. That thing took a piece of his soul, and I will never fucking forgive them that." Pappy sputtered at me, the flame of fury burning in his eyes.

I nodded my head, taken back by his outburst. I leaned back into my chair as Pappy collected himself. "AIl in all I think I've killed about two dozen winndy's since then. Never went looking for them outright, suppose I just knew where they liked to lurk and got lucky. Made some friends over the years who were like minded but frankly, I always thought they were a bit nutty about it. I parted ways with them, kept in touch with one or two of the fellas and hunted with them once in a while. Could tell ya stories boy, but this aint the time for running my mouth any longer. Tomorrow night we go after it, today I teach ya to shot."

"Why would we go after it." I retorted, stunned at his demands. 

"They just don't go away boy. They linger and tear away at ya, just waiting for your guard to drop." Pappy exclaimed. I was about to protest once more when I finally put it together. A wave of guilt and fear washed over me as I looked Pappy dead in the eye.

"Why did it have his voice." I demanded, my tone quiet as a church mouse. 

"You know the answer to that already boy." Pappy replied solemnly, his stoney face vacant of paring my feelings.  I mulled his words over and sprung to my feet, leaping over to choke Pappy to death. I was screaming profanity at him when he calmly jabbed the cane into my chest, causing me to fall back to my seat. I coughed up a lung as I tried to repair my crushed chest, and Pappu just looked on. Bitter tears swelled up on my face, but I refused to let him see them.

"I didn't want him to hunt them. Your brother hunted game with me, and he was damn good at it. Then they came. Four months ago. They chortled at us at night, egging us on. Richard didn't believe my stories and I tried; Tyler I TRIED to stop him from going out there." Pappy croaked out. His voice was burdened with suffering. "He lied and said he wouldn't. I found him in the yard the next morning, he had snuck out. His voice called out to me that evening." Pappy took a deep sigh, like he had unburdened himself enough for the day. "You can hate me all ya want boy. Fact don't change that thing is still out there making a mockery of his voice. I can't. . . I can't do it alone Tyler." Pappy pleaded begrudgingly. I just stared at him, struggling to find the words. Finally, I found them.

"Fine. We go get this thing and that's it. I don't want to see you ever again." Pappy simply nodded.
