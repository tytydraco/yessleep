The next morning, I rose exactly like the last; hungover. I remembered the events from the night before and pushed my palm against my aching forehead in frustration; don’t piss off the barman! Why would you piss off the barman? And I lost a tenner!

It wasn’t the end of the world though, I’d apologise to him and buy him a pint, that solved most issues in Staylittle. And, with all hope, the kids would actually come into the surgery and weren’t going to spend my money on street drugs. Not that there was a way to get street drugs in my village, as much as I sometimes wished there was. 

I got out of bed, lethargically dressed and downed the pint of water I left by my bed the night before. I made crumpets, holding one in my mouth as I opened my garden gate, being careful this time to look left and right before exiting. I made the walk down to the surgery eating my breakfast, a crumpet. It tasted off. Leaves covered the ground, with few left in the trees along my walk.

Once again, I pulled out my keys to open the surgery’s door, but the lights were already on. I didn’t do anything untoward, I just thought I was late this day. I opened the door, took off my coat to place on the communal rack, and took a routine brief look around the empty waiting room. No unwanted visitors this morning, I thought, only my appointments.

I turned to my right towards the reception and wrote my name on the sign-in sheet. Dot was sitting at her desk but hadn’t said a word.

“Morning, Dot,” I said, not looking up from the paper.

“Morning, doctor,” she said, in a much softer tone than usual, causing me to look up from the page sharply. The fact that this startled me should tell you all you need to know about her character. She was the same old Dot, sat there with the same old mole on her face and peach-dyed grey and brittle hair, but she looked different; she looked worried.

“You okay, Dot, you don’t seem yourself,” I said, genuinely concerned. She looked like she could burst into tears at any moment.

“No.. it’s… it’s fine doctor, I’ll set an appointment,” she replied, unable to keep my eye contact.

“Oh, then I can help, I think I have a patient in about,” I checked my watch, “ten minutes, but after that I’m free, is that all okay, Dot?”

She didn’t reply.

“Dot?” I repeated, with inflection.

“Yes, doctor, I’ll see you after,” she replied with a slight waiver from her otherwise flat response, at the same time using her swivel chair to turn her back to me and find something across the reception area. Her hands searched pen pots and upturned papers strewn across the unkept desk. I believe she was just pretending to look for something, and this was confirmed as I stood, waiting for her to pick something up. She didn’t but didn’t turn round to look at me, knowing I was still there. For Dot, this was very, very odd behaviour. As much as the borderline sexual harassment kind of creeped me out, Dot was one of the old guard, a relic of the past, a dying breed. I liked her and wanted to help.

“Okay Dot, well… well I’ll see you then,” I said, placing the pen down on the desk as I did so. I picked up the apple with the same hand and started to walk to my office, but after a couple of steps, I turned back around.

“Dot, just take it easy okay? just tell the patient to come right in, no more hassle needed,” She didn’t reply, instead nodding slightly once, before finding the pen she was supposedly looking for. Clicking it, she turned slightly and gave me a half smile over her shoulder. I smiled slightly back and nodded my head. I turned on my heel and headed to my office.

Lime green walls once again greeted me as I pulled back my chair, sat on it, and pulled myself towards the desk. I booted up my computer and placed the apple on my desk. As Windows Vista greeted me on the screen, I leaned on my elbows, folding my hands together and resting the side of my face on them in order to get a good look at the clock face above the door. 9:07 am. My patient was late, but then again I was too that morning. 

I rested like this until 9:15 am, glazing over and watching the seconds tick by, before lifting my head off my hands, motivating myself enough to get the patient’s details up on my computer. I fully expected that the patient wouldn’t be coming in at this point and the normal process on this occasion was to get Dot to call the patient at home, but I decided to save her the job, as she was definitely not herself. I didn’t actually know who I was scheduled to see, as I usually waited until the last minute to pull up my patient’s medical records as people cancelled, or just didn’t turn up, often. The details popped up on my screen and I put my head in my hands.

“This bloody kid,” I rubbed my forehead with my thumb and index finger, leaning back in my chair.

“When I said “book an appointment next time”, I didn’t mean the next bloody day,” I said to myself, picking up the corded landline with my free hand and continued to rub my forehead.

I dialled the landline on the screen, his parent’s number, and scanned his medical record as it rang. There had been a new entry input this morning by Pat, probably from our answer phone last night. One word stood out to me. “Holes”. 

“This is Judy Tynsedale,” I snapped back to attention and was in the process of crafting a reply before the voice continued: “I’m sorry but I can’t get to the phone right now, please leave a message after the beep.”

I sighed and put the phone down. I couldn’t really leave a message on his Mum’s answer phone if she called back and asked why I called, I didn’t want to put the kid in a position where he’d have to tell his Mum that he had chlamydia. Instead, I returned to my natural position of leaning back in my chair and looking up at the clock above the door. Twenty minutes past nine. There was a quick knock which caused me to straighten with a start and the door opened hesitantly. I cleared my throat.

“Come in,” I said now sitting upright pretending to look at my screen with intensity. I heard the click-clack of someone walking in on the laminate floor before the door closed slowly with a gentle click. I fully expected it to be the boy that walked into the room considering how meek the entrance had been, but peeling my eyes away from the nothing that was on my screen, I instead saw Dot standing in front of the doorway.

“Oh Dot, my patient hasn’t arrived, I was just going to get y-,” I started, stopping when Dot started unbuttoning her blouse.

“Dot, Jesus Christ, what are you doing,” I stood up immediately and took a step back, covering my eyes with one hand and holding the other, palm out, in her direction.

“You have to see, you have to see, I don’t know what to do, I don’t know,” she was crying, and the words were pronounced with a painful wheeze as if she had a lump in her throat. Without me knowing, she had moved around my extended arm, clasping two strong hands onto my other, pulling it down in a swift motion, and exposing my eyes to her chest. 

Her bare breast sagged upon her gut, dangling towards her waist. At the centre of her left breast was a cluster of open white cysts, leaking a clear liquid slowly, but constantly, with each heartbeat. This mass seemed to act like a nucleus for an angry red rash that covered her whole chest and breasts, small blotches of those same white cysts speckled throughout. Her veins were pressed to the skin’s surface and looked to be throbbing.

“Oh my God, Dot, how long have you had this? How long have you been sitting with this?” My immediate thought was cancer, and at this stage, this looked fatal, it looked like it had spread through her bloodstream and, even if it hadn’t, large portions of her chest and both breasts would have to be removed if she didn’t respond well to chemo. You could say I was almost captivated for a few seconds, but I then drew my eyes away from her chest and to her face. Poor Dot was inconsolable, her heavily applied rouge ran down her face. A congealed mess of mucus and foundation formed under her nose and dribbled down her lips.

“Please help me, please, please,” she fell to her knees and hung her head, arms to her side. She was not wiping her face and a trail of drool and mucus hung from her chin. While I was momentarily taken aback by the wound, I snapped myself out of it quickly; I was a doctor, and I had seen much worse. Or had I? This wound was different… it just wasn’t anything I had seen before. It truly was awful. I knelt down opposite Dot, her face not visible when bowed. I fumbled in my pockets to find a crumpled-up napkin I had taken from the pub the night before. I reached my hand out to give it to her but she didn’t take it. I dropped it in her lap. She wasn’t crying so much anymore.

“This is what we’re going to do, Dot, okay?” I wasn’t sure if she was listening.

“Pick up the tissue if you’re listening, Dot, I need to tell you what we’re going to do to get you all safe and better,” I continued to kneel but her face was still not visible. After a few seconds, she reached and took the napkin from her lap with a trembling hand. She began to wipe her face slowly. I nodded in acknowledgment and continued.

“I’m going to call you an ambulance and get you checked out but it’ll probably be a couple of hours until it gets here. Until then I’ll get you bandaged up and we will do a few tests, okay?” she wasn’t responding but I carried on anyway. “I have other patients today so you’ll have to wait in Dr. Jameson’s room, but we’ll lay you down and you can have a rest. Like I said, Dot, only a couple of hours and we’ll get you completely looked over, and then no more worry, we will know, you will know.” I already knew but my rambling seemed to comfort her. She looked up at me and smiled slightly. Her make-up was still smudged on her face but what I fully noticed was how old Dot looked.

“Thanks, doll,” she took my hands in hers. We stayed like that for a few seconds before I gave her palms a squeeze and stood.

“Now come on, this is a respectable establishment, put that top back on,” I winked and turned my back to her. She laughed dryly, so dry it was almost a cough.

“You perv,” she replied and I laughed too. The air felt a whole lot lighter. She put her blouse back on and I turned back around. To see a dishevelled-looking Dot, but still Dot. I guided her to a chair and sat her down, then I took a seat and looked instinctively towards the clock. I stopped myself almost immediately and I don’t think Dot noticed; she was not wasting my time and I didn’t want her to think that she was. I refocused and picked up the landline to call the ambulance. It rang and I was put through to the operator. I described the situation and gave the address for the surgery.

“We will have an ambulance dispatched shortly,” said the operator placidly.

“Could you give me a ballpark figure on how long it’ll be until it gets here, please,” I replied.

“I shouldn’t really say-.”

“I know you shouldn’t say but I’m asking you if you could,”

“I… okay…” I could hear the keyboard being tapped rapidly over the phone. A few seconds passed. “Oh… there seem to be a number of ambulances already heading to Staylittle, are you sure that this hasn’t already been called in?”

“What? No, it hasn’t.”

“Okay...” I could tell she doubted me. “An ambulance will be with you within three hours.” She paused. “If not sooner.”

I ignored the dig.

“Thank you.”

I put the phone down and suppressed a sigh. Three hours. I didn’t know what to do with my hands; I went to rub my temples but I didn’t want to seem stressed in front of Dot. I forced both hands flat on the table instead and turned to Dot, straining a smile.

“Not long now, girl.”

The sound of smashing glass made me wake with a jolt. I looked around the room but it wasn’t my window, but it must have been in the same building. How long had I been out? I didn’t even remember falling asleep but checking my watch it had only been forty-five minutes. In my sleep-deprived state I had the strangest thought that the broken glass was my next very impatient patient hurtling whatever they could to get into the surgery and have their increasingly sore-throat looked at, but this thought left almost as soon as I thought it up; who could be that desperate, wouldn’t they just go to A&E? I looked to my right to see Dot was now led on her side on the examination table, back facing to me. She must have become tired and done this on her own accord, I admit the padded table had been a makeshift bed for me on occasion during a long-overdue lunch break. I decided not to wake her, instead, I stood to investigate the noise outside, I reached down to take the apple from my desk…

Rotten. It was rotten. Maggots crawled through the decayed mass that lay almost flat on my desk. It looked as if it had been there for weeks. I frantically pulled out my mobile phone to check the date, but it was the same day as before I had fallen asleep. I felt almost relieved until I noticed the dozens of missed calls I had received, which instantly gave me a cold sweat.

“What the fuck is going on?” I said to myself as I opened my phone and dialed 121 to listen to the first of the voice messages, opening the door out of my office and into the hallway, walking down to the reception and where I believed the smashing sound had come from. I was immediately aware of the sound of what sounded like a riot outside of the main entrance. The plants in the hallway were dead and rotten.

“Seventeen new messages… Message one…” my phone said to me as I entered the reception area. Shards of glass covered the floor as dozens of people banged at the door, at the windows, at the walls themselves, attempting to get inside. When they saw me, a collective scream tore through the crowd, one of relief, pain, anger, and fear; screams of “help me”, “help us” or anything else, the sound immediately made me piss myself in fear.

“…throwing up maggots” was the last thing I heard from my phone before I dropped it on the ground, rushing to the front door to unlock it. As I attempted to do so, I looked up to the figure behind the green door, the little window in the middle completely smashed through allowing me a clear view of the barman from last night. Except his eye was gone, replaced with dozens of maggots that swarmed around the empty socket, chewing through the flesh of his face, some deciding that the used-up flesh of his eye was no longer appetizing and deciding to burrow new holes around his entire face. He stopped banging the door and screaming for just a second, frantically taking both hands to claw at the clumps of larvae that filled his face; almost as if he was demonstrating how futile this act was, he pressed his face through the window in the door so he was less than an inch from mine, teeth in a clenched grimace and his remaining eye bloodshot and opening almost unnaturally large. I had a clear view of his eye socket that had been chewed down to the bone, the handfuls that he had removed already being replaced by the ones eating away at his brain, crawling back through the cavern left by his eradicated eyeball and into the artificial light of the surgery reception. With what looked like extreme effort, he unclenched his jaw and opened his mouth laboriously, as if his jaw weighed tons, spilling maggots from his mouth in the process, many falling onto my chest, trousers, and shoes. Maggots swarmed his gums and tongue.

You may judge me for what I did next, but I know that God will judge me, and with each word I write, and each day I live, I make myself accountable. 

I took a step back. I stepped away from the door, I did not unlock it. I instead looked around at each of the faces pressed at each of the windows, the bodies pushing at each other, people attempting to climb through windows far too small for them, breaking and dislocating bones in the process, ripping large cuts through the soft skin of their bellies along the broken glass of the window frames. Each of these people, covered in maggots, all the patients that had turned up with rashes in the last few days had these innocuous patches replaced by writhing swarms of flesh-eating larvae. I understand that I could not have helped them all, that I would have likely been ripped apart by a horde driven crazy by pain, but at least I could have tried. But instead. I took another step back. And another. As the faces screamed louder, the screams rose from anguish to terrific anger. Anger at me for daring to leave them as I turned tail and ran. I was not thinking clearly, I was terrified. I ran from the people that needed my help the most, to my office, locking the door behind me.

I faced the door and took a step back, unsure how to process what I had just seen. The general crashing continued before I loud boom notified me that the door had been broken down, torn completely from its hinges. I heard the sound of dozens of footsteps with accompanying screams racing through the reception and hallway to my office door where fists, feet, and bodies were flung at it, attempting to break it down. I threw myself against the door, attempting to brace it from the front, before turning my back to the door and bracing it from behind. Which is when I saw him. Joe.

“P-please help me.”

He must have climbed through the now open window leading into my office. He stood in the middle of the room, Dot led motionless on the table next to him, she did not seem to have moved. He looked relatively normal, clothed in jeans and a plain t-shirt but with eyes blood-shot wide with horror and tear-stained cheeks.

“Please… please… please.”

He kept repeating this phrase as he undid his belt methodically and went to drop his jeans. I could not draw my eyes away although I knew what to expect. His jeans fell down to his ankles and where his genitals previously were was a writhing mass of larvae, spreading also to his stomach and upper thighs. 

“Please… please… please.”

He moved closer to me, arms outstretched. He hugged me, maggots falling from his crotch onto my jeans. I was paralysed and felt like I could pass out at any second.

“Please… please… pl-.“

He dropped to the floor in a heap and the roaring sound from the other side of the door was replaced by a succession of thuds over the space of several seconds as my patients all collapsed as Joe had done. The silence was deafening. I waited several seconds before slumping to the floor, back to the wall, and knees to my chest. I couldn’t stop shaking. I focused on my senses: the smooth fabric of my trousers, the stench of my own piss mixed with the sickly smell of rot from the apple, an ambulance wailing in the distance mixed with the collective gorging of the maggots on Joe’s corpse, my knees directly in front of my face blocking my vision. I didn’t look at the boy as I unclasped my right hand from my knee and made its way to Joe’s neck. I checked for a pulse but could not find one, only the occasional maggot thrashing under his skin. I leaned back against the wall and placed my hands on the ground on either side of me, only to recoil them immediately after finding I’d placed them directly into a swarm of maggots. I stood quickly, wiping maggots off my hands and body frantically, only now remembering fully what sort of situation I found myself in. I moved over to Dot to check her pulse, moving her body on her back. Her chest and face were cavernous holes but the maggots no longer feasting upon her but seemingly leaving her body. I believe I threw up at this point.

I cannot continue for now, this recounting is making me feel sick. I will finish the story of my time at Staylittle tomorrow.
