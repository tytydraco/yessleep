Hi! 26 M here from NY. I went to church until I was about 7. I never enjoyed going, I’m not religious, and I still don’t believe in christ or the bible. For a long time I called myself atheist but now I consider myself to be spiritual.

I moved into a 1952 house in a beautiful neighborhood in Tampa, FL in 2021. The very first night I stayed at the house, I had my first dream that I have had in months, if not years. At first, I didn’t know I was dreaming. I felt myself slightly wake as it sounded like someone was in my house. I thought it could be my dog until my bedroom door opens, which my dog could not do. I immediately knew someone was breaking into my house (in my dream still). I’m a pretty big & manly man so I wasn’t really worried but I was prepared to fight someone that shouldn’t be in my house. I layer there stiff as I hear this “robber” move towards my closet. I counted to 3 in my head before attempting to spring out of bed and launch myself at this person. 1… 2… and on 3, I realized I had sleep paralysis BUT at the same time I could feel this presence (the robber) know I was going to attack. As they make their way towards my bedside, and I cannot move, I feel this darkness lurk over me and lips slowly approach my ear. “Devil” the dream robber whispers, as I immediately wake up after and spring out of bed & back to life. Though very shaken, I still hadn’t pinned this to our ghost, Harold, until later.

When I first moved into my house, I constantly would tell people “I think this used to be a very small school.” My house, despite its age, felt very youthful. Months after this dream, I began to witness just how youthful. It started with small noises that could be ruled off as the house creaking, to solid doors opening & closing, and even to my things going missing and ending up in very odd places (the fridge, in my shoe, etc.) I was constantly dismissing these things, as I did not believe in ghosts. Well, Harold refused to be ignored. One night, I had a friend over and we were cooking dinner & watching a movie. I hadn’t told anyone about the strange things happening, as I didn’t want to seem crazy. I left the kitchen for a brief moment and upon return my friend says “do you know you have a ghost?” And then goes on to explain something touched her before opening the fridge and several kitchen cabinets. This is something I would wake up to often, but I always thought I must’ve done it in my sleep. That night, I explained everything to her and we named the ghost Harold. We didn’t believe he was actually a devil or evil though. We felt Harold was a youthful soul, who died young and was enjoying playing tricks on us. 

Despite this all, I’m sure you may still be doubting Harold & his existence. I understand. I have one last encounter that will never leave my memories. After a morning of a drinking, I and 3 friends sat around my living room talking about the night before. As we talked, we ended up on the topic of Harold. As I explained to them what Harold does, a box full of books comes flying off of a nearby shelf. Everyone is shocked as the room goes silent and eyes go wide. Then a sound starts to come from the other room. It’s an air mattress that someone was sleeping on the night before. The MANUAL switch had somehow turned on to inflate. We all creeped towards the room and the second we entered the same room, WE SAW THE MANUAL SWITCH TURN TO OFF. I’ve owned this air mattress for years. You can leave it plugged in and that switch never turns unless someone does it with their hand. Everyone ran out of the room and had no issues believing in Harold after that. 

I hope Harold got a laugh out of messing with us all and I hope he rest his soul soon. ❤️
