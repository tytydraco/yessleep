Then woods. A place where all good scary stories happen. I went camping around 3 weeks ago, my second time ever, it has solidified that I will never go camping ever again. The first time I went camping, I was in a place where there were multiple people around, all camping in tents, cabins, and RV's, so obviously nothing would be around. But the last time I went camping, was in the middle of the woods behind my house. 

Before I talk about my experience where I saw this thing up close, this wasn't the first time I saw it. The woods behind my house are big, stretching about 3 miles across. These woods are big, and camping was the first time I really explored the forest. The first time I saw the thing was when I was in my bedroom, on the balcony. The balcony faces the forest, with it being about 20 feet away from the balcony. It was evening, and I was looking at the pretty sky when I saw something moving out of the corner of my eye, on a tree. I quickly turned, thinking to see a squirrel or even a cat, but I saw something else. A big man like creature, easily over 6 feet tall, skinny body with a darkish brown color. I couldn't see specifics because I only saw it for half a second and it was turned away from me as it jumped to another tree, to where I couldn't see it. 

I quickly went inside after that, scared of what I saw was real. 

A few weeks later, my friend, who I shall call Dean for this story, came over and said we should go camping in my woods, due to them being so big. Of course I thought about what I saw that night, but I excused it as the darkness playing tricks on my eyes because I really wanted to go camping with him. A big mistake.

2 days later, we got all our things ready, big tent, food, snacks, fire wood, chairs, all you need, and headed into the forest. We walked a mile into the forest, and set up camp after finding a good flat area. We set up the tent, put down the wood and got ready to set up a fire. I was bored so I decided to go for a walk and explore the forest because as I said, I had never really explored the forest. One thing I didn't mention to Dean is that I felt uneasy and the feeling of being watched during the whole walk there and at the campsite, but instead of staying in the safety of the campsite, I instead went out on that walk. While walking I stumbled on something I wish I didn't. A dead bear. This bear wasn't just lying on the ground dead from natural causes, this thing was fucking mutilated. The head was torn off, legs were brutally beaten up, stomach was ripped open with the guts thrown out, slashes in the body, and 2 large holes in the main body, like a vampire or spider bite. Multiple things from this find horrified me, not only are bear apex predators, not only can no animal, including humans, do this, the cuts were ridged, not from any cutting tool, this was from claws, most likely the same that were on the body. My mind went to the thing I saw that one night, but that thing was skinny, how could it take a bear, and mutilate it like this. 

I quickly ran back, screaming for Dean. Dean met me halfway, asking what was wrong. I told him everything, about the bear, about the thing I saw that night, and saying how I thought they were connected. 

"Ya know, I've been feeling unnerved this whole time as well, I just didn't want you to feel worried" Dean said.

It was too dark at that point to leave without risking getting lost, so we just stayed there and hoped whatever did that to the bear didn't come back. I was worried while we sat by the fire, making hot dogs. As we sat there, though, we heard branches snapping, movement in the trees, and just overall the vibe of not being alone. 

After what felt like forever, we went into the tent and went to sleep, but not for long. A bit later, me and Dean wake up to movement outside the tent. We realized it was a bear and relaxed for a second until the bear started making noises at something. Then we hear 2 very clear foot steps, and then a scream. This scream was very weird, I have never heard anything like it, I was not a scream of fear, it was like a war cry, it was like a mix of a lions roar and a quick repeating clicking noise (It probably sounded different but I can't describe it that well). The bear and creature started to make a conundrum while obviously fighting. We couldn't hear much but it was clear that the bear was losing horribly. After the fighting stopped, Dean and I looked out and saw the creature looking at the bear, equally mutilated as the bear from earlier. That's when the creature looked up, at us, and this is where I got to see the creature's full body. 

This thing was not just over 6 feet tall, but I'd estimate around 7 feet tall, it was skinny and was darkish brown as I saw the first time, but I noticed some things I didn't notice last time. This thing had long arms, around 5 feet, with 6 fingers, not 5, 6, all clawed with the claws extending to at least 5 inches, they were obsidian black and shiny. The legs were similar with the same claws but only 3 toes. It had to arm like things protruding out its back that were clawed with a single claw definitely over a foot long, kinda like the necromorph from Dead Space. But its head was the worst part. It was the head of not a deer, or wolf, or any normal skinwalker creature, it was the head of a spider. The fangs were huge, with 8 black beady eyes, with the 2 main ones on the front of the face being bigger, with a small red dot in each one. 

I looked at us for only a few seconds, but it felt like an eternity, as I stared into its dark, hollow eyes. After that it simply walked away, leaving us, probably not seeing us as prey. We didn’t sleep at all after that, and as soon as dawn hit, we were out of that forest. I have not been back since, and I do not plan to go back, it was the scariest night of my life. I don’t know what it was, it was skinny, but not pale like any skinwalker you would see, and the spider head just makes it worse, and it can even fight a bear and win with most likely minimal effort. 

I talked to my neighbor, who lived in this town for 50 years, about my experience, and he told me something that shocked me. He has known about this creature for a long while. He first encountered this creature only after living in the town for a few months, when he was camping, he saw it in the treeline, observing him, every time he saw it and looked at it, it quickly turned away. It happened a few more times until he went into his tent. He has encountered the creature multiple times after that, and the creature has never seemed hostile, just curious. 

Needless to say, I plan to move out soon enough, even though it showed no harm to us, I don’t want to see if it will, plus the thing is horrifying and I don’t want to risk the chance of seeing it every now and then.
