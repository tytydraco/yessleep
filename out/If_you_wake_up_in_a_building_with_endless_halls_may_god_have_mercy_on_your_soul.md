My memory is fading. As I get deeper in these halls, it feels as if im loosing myself. I have tried to turn around, it looks the damn same. There's only forward, and I'm afraid of it. I am trying to write everything down to try to keep sanity, not sure how this will get out there. If it does my name is..... wait.... what the fuck is my name. I can't remember, how can I not remember my own damn name. 

I don't know how I got here. Holy shit.... I don't even remember where I was before here. It feels like it's been hours. Everytime I feel like I'm getting somewhere, I find myself back in these same halls. Like I've said I tried to turn around, it feels like im in a real life mirror. 

I've started to hear scraping on the marble flooring. It sounds like something is in here with me. I am constantly looking back. The scraping is getting closer, and I am starting to pick up my pace. I will write a update as soon as I can.

I can't stop shaking. What is this, what in the actual fuck is this. The scraping eventually caught up to me. I peered behind, but what I saw... what that thing was. I ran as fast as I could, but it didn't waiver, it kept chase. It screeched as it pursued, and I thought that was my end. Until I saw the first thing other than walls, a door. I didn't think, I just ran through. My surroundings were a blessing, it was a change. It was what I could only describe to be a waiting room. There was a desk in the middle, and I hid behind it. I heard that thing enter the room. As it got closer, I was able to see what it looked like for the first time.

It was hideous, a tall figure that looked like a pig and a moose went through a blender. It wielded a large axe, and dragged it on the ground to its side. As it scanned the room, it snorted and left. I sighed with relief. There was another door to my right, and after attempting to calm myself down, I proceeded forward. What the next room looked like, I could only describe a playplace in a mc donalds. 

There was a large slide, leading into a ballpit. Connected at the top of the slide, was a tunnel leading into the walls, Tables to the right and left, and... music was playing?
It was faint, but it almost sounded like those children's songs you would hear in a daycare. Wait... I remember something. I.... have a brother, a younger brother. He is 3, and I am his guardian. That's all I could remember for now.

 There are no more doors, I think I might have to climb the slide. 

As I entered the tunnels, I started to hear crawling behind me. I didn't gave time to scream, I just crawled as fast as I could. After what felt like forever, I fell into another room. Then I heard that monstrosity again, it came around the corner and dead sprinted at me. My heart skipped a beat, and I bairly was able to dodge one of the strikes and I ran. I stumbled through double doors and found myself in.... daylight? As I turned around I saw a empty field where I came from. 

I remember now, I was investigating dissapearences at a abandoned daycare. 3 men went in and never came out. Those poor souls. Noone deserves to go through that hell. Somehow I survived but it doesn't feel like all of me did.
