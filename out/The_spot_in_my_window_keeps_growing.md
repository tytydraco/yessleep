Remember how, in 8th grade or so, they taught you evolution in school? Maybe your teachers taught you the phrase differently, or maybe just the concept itself, but, from my knowledge, it is mandatory in every school around the world (except maybe private Catholic schools or something): "Survival of the fittest."

The concept being that animals who have favorable aspects to survive will most likely survive enough to have a child who also has the same aspects, who will survive long enough to pass them on again and so on and so on. Effectively making the gene's sole purpose to survive. Common sense, right? Well what if i told you that has only been the truth because it's the most possible outcome of the many, many slides evolution could've gone through.

Allow yourself to imagine what would happen if a random microbe started exploding. Multiplying itself millions of times faster than a normal cell is physically allowed to for no discernible reason. On top of that, it evolving as if its purpose was to become the unrivaled life form. As if it wasn't obvious enough, I have found this... "Miracle" for lack of a better word.

It is currently 12 AM, Friday. At 3:35 yesterday, I woke up for absolutely no reason. The floors are not creaky; I live alone in a cabin 2 hours from the nearest farmer's market, and there are no rats. I was not thirsty, but I yearned for water. I stepped out of my room and walked seven steps to the door (not including me getting up from bed) and 5 more steps to my "kitchenette" counter, where there is a light switch on the right-hand side. I turned on the light and saw in front of me a light-gray spot on the kitchen window. I looked outside, expecting it to be a piece of a plastic bag. It was not. The gray was about an inch in length and a half inch in width.

I proceeded to stare at it intently, if I had to guess- because it was 2 inches in length and an inch in width.

I used to watch reruns of Dragon Ball Z on Adult Swim as a kid, and as many avid watchers of Adult Swim know, their anti-smoking ads were pretty gory. Looking back at them now, they were VERY funny, but 6-year-old me did not find Little Lungs getting mangled because he smoked humorous by any means. I, as you could guess, never smoked. Never did any drugs at all, even avoided weed, though it was legal in my state. This quickly ruled out me being high on hallucinogens. I also ruled out there being a gas leak since I have an up-to-date gas leak sensor (how fucking dare they make em 500 goddamn dollars, btw). After a few seconds of hesitating, I rubbed my eyes since being asleep was the only sane explanation for seeing a deflated balloon grow twice its original size in a blink. It was still there, and it was big enough to cover my hand if I tried covering it.

Smoothly, I raised my hand to it to feel its consistency and also prove to myself it was actually there. When my finger got about an inch from it, the gray immediately receded to an even smaller state than it was when I first saw it. At this point being about half the size of my pinky nail. I darted, now being more than fully conscious. Without missing a beat, the gray started growing exponentially faster than it did before I got closer. I slapped the window full force, hard enough to make my wrist hurt. The next moment, I pissed myself. Because then was when I realized I was facing something fundamentally more important than my existence. *It grew upwards*.

As if it had learned that I would try smothering it, and the only way to stop that from happening was to grow big enough so it would not fear being embraced. The last state I saw it in before running to the bathroom, was it now being circular and growing perfectly horizontal as to become a translucent cylinder. It did not start bending downwards; it didn't look like it was moving at all. The best way to describe what I saw was as if someone had made a hole through the window and was sliding a cup through. I slammed the sliding door and fell to my knees.

I think I passed out for a couple of seconds. Considered sleeping right there cause since my mind hadn't fully accepted what I had seen as the truth, this narrowed down my condition to 2 possibilities. I've gone mental, or i'm still sleeping. I left for a primal fear I still do not understand. It forced me to get up. I cannot remember how the lighter got in my hand... or me passing through the hallway. I would not have known what happened, in fact, if my conscious didn't pop in the last couple frames. This is all I remember. Exactly as I remember it. I was looking at my palms, my hands dragged in the bathroom floor. Then, I saw what I can only explain as the rudimentary elements of a Human.

Like a Picasso painting. 2 frustums touching the floor, another as the center, two acting as arms, and the part that most frightened me. A cylinder far too long to be discerned as anything, if it was not placed over the body, facing down, as if contemplating its body. It was not aligned with the rest of his body, instead facing outwards, terrifyingly showing its 3rd dimension. It was no longer translucent or gray. It was black and dense. A tone so deep my brain burns when I remember it. This was to humans, what we thought of ourselves to cattle. An abstract human.

Only remember seeing him for an instant, and afterwards, 2 more frames. The first was black, for I blinked. In the same, I felt myself turn on the lighter with my right pointer. The second is me and my arm holding the lighter outstretched, and the gray retracted into the window pane. In what was probably the biggest moment of ingenuity of my life, I slammed the lighter on the glass repeatedly until I chipped the piece where the gray spot went back to (Undeniably not a coincidence it was the same where I first spotted it). I opened my mini-oven, chucked the shitty glass in, and set it to 200 degrees. Thankfully, it was a relatively low heat. You will see why later. I saw the small, porous parts which had not yet regenerated fully attempting to grow, melt, hit the bottom of the oven, evaporate, and eventually dissipate over the course of a minute. I must have stayed there, looking inside, making sure it did not grow back for 30 minutes. I was completely immersed. My deepest subconscious was not thinking of anything else but checking for changes inside the oven. At around the 30-minute mark, I snapped back to reality. Just when I was gonna stand up and go back to bed with the oven on, I saw a tiny gray circle in the piece of ceramic. I decided to test something: Raised the temperature to 201 degrees, and sure enough, it disappeared once more.

When it started growing the 3rd time, I raised the temperature to 203 and immediately opened the oven and stabbed it with a knife. It did not grow back immediately as the knife was retracted from its flaky substance. I closed the oven just as fast as I had opened it. Thirty minutes later, I repeated the same process. Raised the temperature, stabbed it, closed the oven. From my experiences, I have learned 5 things.

1st: It always returns to the tile. Specifically the same exact spot it first appeared in.

2nd: The gray can only evolve to one thing at a time.

3rd: I can confuse it.

4th: It can only protect itself against things it has already had time to heal from before.

5th, and most important, I do not know how to kill it.

I have tried to keep a cool head. Trying to use the scientific method. Anything to reassure myself this is not invincible. For right now, my goals are simple. Find help; Keep it contained; Maybe send the gray to the government; Keep it from evolving most as possible; And above all, stay sane. I haven't slept in 20 hours, and the mini-oven only goes to 400. I set a timer to raise the temperature every 30 minutes so I could go to sleep, but I am having a hard time not shaking if I don't have my gun in my hands, and it would be comedically tragic to die to gun safety after surviving a... God Like species. I have 60 hours till I run outta heat. I hope it is enough. Please let it be enough. I'm currently getting ready to jack my oven to my car battery so I can transport the gray to the city, maybe call the police department, somehow prove that it's real. Make em call their higher-ups until they get someone competent. Someone who isn't me.

Will update.
