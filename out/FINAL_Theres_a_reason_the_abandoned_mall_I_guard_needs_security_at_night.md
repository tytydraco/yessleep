A firm hand grabbed my shirt and pulled me backward. I fell inside the room as the door slammed shut.

I clambered to my feet, spinning around wildly to see two figures.

An older man, tanned and rugged looking with a poorly kept beard, and Adam.

"I... wha..." I couldn't even begin to form sentences.

"Did you go inside a store?" Adam said firmly.

"I... she..." I stammered.

"ANSWER HIM DAMNIT!" The older man yelled, spit flinging from his mouth.

"Yes! To escape the fucking girl who..."

Adam threw his hands in the air in defeat and turned to the older man.

"He's fucked, right? There's no way."

I swallowed hard. I started to speak but Adam raised his hand, silencing me.

The older man spat into the small metal bin in the corner.

"I ain't never seen anyone actually do it."

Adam grimaced and turned back to face me.

"I SPECIFICALLY..." He saw the shocked look on my face and took a breath.

"I specifically told you to NEVER go into a store."

I jumped as a loud banging noise started on the door.

Adam cursed and pushed me aside.

"We need to un-fuck this. Now!"

The older man grumbled and sat down on the chair, looking up at me with a scowl.

"Where's the maintenance guy?"

"I... Chris?"

"Whatever his fuckin' name is." The older man grunted.

"I don't know, he was chasing me and I..."

Another loud bang on the door.

"Mark, what are we doing here?" Adam called back to him.

"Wait, you're Mark!?" My voice caught.

"That doesn't matter, kid. What fuckin' store did you go in!" His words dripped with anger.

"I don't know!"

Adam looked me dead in the eyes.

"If you went in there again, would you remember what store it was?"

I thought for a second.

"I... I guess?"

The door thumped so hard it bent for a second.

"We have to move. Now." Adam looked at Mark.

Mark stood up slowly and arched his back, stretching it.

Adam threw the door open, revealing nothing on the other side.

He groaned and grabbed my arm, pulling me back down the corridor. Mark followed behind us, walking at a casual pace.

"But... the thing at the door?" I asked, confused.

"Don't worry about the fucking mimic. Worry about where you are!" He answered.

"Do you see the lights and the people?" I winced as he pulled me along.

"No, because I stick to the damn rules!"

We made it to the main atrium when a store caught my eye.

"That one!" I yelled out, pointing to a clothing store.

Adam shot a quick look around and we dashed to the front of the store.

"Go back in and do exactly what you did. Hopefully it will fix this." He shoved me inside. I saw his hands hit something as he pushed me.

I stumbled inside, the worker tilting her head at me.

"Are you okay, sir?"

I ignored her and ran to the storeroom. Locked.

I turned back around to face the worker.

"Hey! Please, I need you to open this! It's urgent! I'm Security!"

The worker looked puzzled.

"I'm sorry, but that door hasn't worked for the last few days. I'll have to call the maintenance guy."

"No, no no, please don't!" I cried out.

Too late. She had lifted a little radio microphone cable to her mouth and began speaking.

I cursed and planted my foot right on the edge of the door near the handle, causing it to break inward, slamming into the wall.

Everyone inside the store spun to look at me.

I didn't care. I needed to get the fuck out of here.

As I entered the room, I felt a wave of nausea hit me, and the music over the speakers warped and stretched weirdly.

My head was throbbing just above my eyes.

I felt like I needed to throw up.

I heard yelling behind me. It sounded like multiple male voices.

I stumbled into the room, my body straining against the sudden change, like the air pressure around me had just plummeted.

I gagged, falling forward into the room.

Every second I found it harder and harder to breathe.

I grabbed the nearest object, a cardboard box, and dragged it under the vent.

The lights flickered, then went out, and the emergency flood lights clicked on, bathing the room in deep crimson.

My whole world was spinning, and I heard voices screaming and people crying from behind me.

I could barely fill my lungs with oxygen as I pulled my body onto the box and forced myself to stand up.

Still, the vent was just barely in reaching distance.

My fingers grazed the vent covering and I managed to pull it off, letting it fall.

With all my strength, I pulled myself up into the vent. As I slid inside, I felt bile shoot up my throat.

The headache had gotten ten times worse, and the vent felt smaller.

I pushed further and further through, desperately running my hands along the bottom of the vent to find the opening.

My vision started to blur. Light danced in my eyes and my arms started to go numb.

I closed my eyes, and the world stopped.



A sharp, cold sensation hit my face, causing me to jerk upright.

I was lying in the center atrium, the rain pelting my face, coming from a hole in the ceiling.

I sat up hazily, my body aching and fighting me.

I blinked and rubbed my eyes.

The center was in ruins again, shops closed, the only light coming from the overcast afternoon sky above me.

I coughed painfully as a spatter of blood hit my hands.

My head was still throbbing.

I rolled over, pushing myself off the wet tiles.

Slowly, I stood up, grabbing a nearby pillar for support.

I tried to feel my pockets for my phone, but I only had my security keys and car keys.

Walking up the escalators was extremely difficult. Every step caused lightning pain to shoot through my body.

The dim light of the afternoon storm barely lit my way to the front of the center.

I slowly produced the keys, unlocking the fire escape door and pushing myself out into the heavy rain.

I spotted my car and stumbled to it.

I unlocked it and threw myself inside.

I sat up and looked back at the center.

My heart sank.

I could just make out three figures standing behind the glass doors through the heavy rain.

Mark, Adam, and Chris.
