"City morgue, you stab them, I store them."

"That's...that's not how it goes, Eli. And you have a lot of freaking explaining to do. I just-"

"Was accosted by my brother and his silly goons?" I could hear his smirk through the phone, the slimy bastard. 

"Yes," I ground out after a pause, "among other things. I think I'm owed some answers here, Eli. I've been doing your bidding for 6 months now, and I've been a good little tech until now, but-"

He cut me off with a lengthy, long-suffering sigh.

"Okay, Witches. One question. Go."

I gaped.

"What, every six months, I'm gonna get one question, in between risking my life?" I spurted.

"Don't be greedy," his laughing voice mocked, "Do you really want more knowledge of me after what just happened?"

I grunted, my mind already racing at the dozens of questions I'd had over the months.

What was he? What was Nathan, his 'nephew'? Why did his brother resemble him, but Nathan didn't? Why didn't he warn me about the gelatin monster, or Keith Kline, or any number of other nightmares I'd walked into?

After several seconds of thought, I burst out, "Are you into me?"

A moment of silence, and then, an outburst of choked laughter. 

"Into you?" he asked, incredulously. 

I blushed, "Your brother said something about you 'caring' for me. I just need you to know I'm not Bella Swan, or whoever. I'm not trying to get with...whatever you are. Which come to think of it is a much better question. Just answer that one."

He was still laughing, "Oh no, little duck, you asked and I shall answer. I am a classic. Ah, how do you humans put this? I only like men. Even as a 'non-binary', as Nathan puts it, you don't have the right equipment for me. I just enjoy you, and you do good work for me."

"Okay," I began, still flustered, "then why was he all hung up like I was stealing his man?"

He quieted for a beat, then sighed.

"My brother is old-fashioned. He does not like the new world order and instead tries to necromance the old one."

"Are you a demon?" I blurted out.

His laughter returned, "That's three questions in total, but I'll let you get away with it this once since you just had to deal with Loster and Vernon. I am not a demon, Witches. I am something else, who's knowledge would simply put you in more danger."

Loster and Vernon must be the goons Sloane had brought with him when he jumped me in the alley. 

"There, paid up for a year and a half," he said lightly as I gaped and began sputtering, "Now. I have a job for you."

"You can NOT be serious right now." 

"Now, now, tit for tat, Witches. This time I have some ground rules that should help. I'll text them to you."

With that, he hung up and I was left staring at the phone, still embarrassed at the disaster that was that phone call. 

This is the text he sent me, along with the client information.


*Do not wear pink.*
*Do not lend.*
*Leave before 6pm.*

I went the next day, getting there early as to be out by the time limit. I was met at the front desk by a brunette receptionist with blazing blue eyes and a buck-toothed smile. She wore a bright pink blazer and clean white jeans. I wondered if pink designated something here, and that's why Eli told me not to wear it. I decided not to ask, glancing down at my all black outfit and wondering if black indicated something as well. Eli didn't exactly send me a full manual, after all. 

When I got up to the office, armed with my guest pass and my duffel, I tracked my way to the original offender, a printer in the main area. Next to it, IT inventory was stacked up, keyboards and mice, servers and phones, disassembled cubicles and assorted tools. 

The printer itself was a quick fix, and after I was finished, I leaned against the stack of keyboards and snatched my phone from my pocket, intending to call Eli and let him know it was done. 

Before I could dial, a woman walked up to me in a pink cardigan and chic black gauchos, her black heels clicking against the linoleum. I was instantly filled with a sort of liquid heat, and I flushed. Was this a siren or was I just down bad? I couldn't tell and I was still flustered thinking about Eli and I's conversation earlier, so I just tried to act casual, shoving my phone and my hand back in my pocket. 

She glanced over at me with bright green bejeweled eyes, stroking a long creamy finger tipped in pink across my jaw, and I froze in absolute shock. I noticed two of her nails were trimmed short and neat, and tried to gulp quietly. 

"Greetings, human. I am called Monica. Can I borrow one of those?" she asked sweetly, gesturing towards the stack of keyboards under my left palm. Her accent was thick, maybe Romanian or Transylvania? Something from the carpathians. It sent a trill of electric energy down my spine. 

"Oh, of course," I shook my head to clear my thoughts, firm in my belief that I would not and could not fall into a mystical thirst trap, grabbing one of the keyboards to hand off.

But as I held the keyboard out to her, she simply smiled, nodding her head and turning on a heel, blowing a kiss my way before making her way down the hall and around a corner. 

Shit, I thought as I plopped the keyboard back on it's stack. I completely forgot about the lending rule. Apparently, she'd let me off this time. Maybe she was just gently reminding me of the rules? Did this even count? It's not like they were *my* keyboards, I was just in the way of them. 

I wasn't sure, but as I turned back, I caught a glance at my hand and stopped dead, my acorn brain working at top speed trying to comprehend what I was looking at. 

When I finally figured it out, I gasped so hard I choked on my own spit and broke down in a coughing fit, not able to take my gaze off of my cartoon hand. The middle finger, of all fingers, was just...missing. It was GONE.

Completely flat like a Ken doll, the divot was filled with skin, like there'd never been a finger there in the first place. I flipped my hand around again and again, flapping my mouth open and closed like a fish.

I'm not sure how long I stayed like that, but eventually another of the office workers walked by, clearly noticing my state of horror. 

"Ha," he chuckled gently, cupping a hand on my shoulder, "don't worry, she'll give it back. She never keeps them for long."

All semblances of professionalism were gone from my brain. 

"Who takes a finger?!" I scream-whispered at him. Okay, I guess there was still some semblance, because if not, I'd have been full on screaming. I've been finger thieved. I *need* that finger, for flipping people off behind their backs and pretending they saw. 

He snorted into a full guffaw, folding over in fits. I just watched him, not able to even build up any spite at being made fun of, simply an eel in a human library, utterly out of my element. 

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," he wheezed out, straightening and wiping a tear from his eye. I noticed his eyes were the same brilliant green as Monica's, and pointed one of my precious remaining fingers towards him. 

"Are you-, Who is-" I sputtered before taking a hearty breath and letting it out slowly. 

"When?" I asked, simply. 

"Ah, I imagine when she's done enchanting it."

"WHAT" I squeaked, my hard-won calm splintering at the thought of receiving back a haunted digit. I wanted her fingers on me, but not like this. 

"I'm her...brother, I suppose would be the best word for it. Our kind normally has dozens of siblings, so it's not quite the special relationship you humans seem to have. Except those Duggar folks. Has anyone tested them for fae blood?" he tapped a finger against his lips in thought. 

I snapped my fingers, on the hand with which I could still snap, foregoing all thoughts of being absolutely smited by this being, pulling his attention back to me. 

"I'm called Charlie. I'm going to be honest, we haven't had an 'i.t. person' in this office for a long time. The last one was a reptilian, so you'll have to excuse the extra interest in you. Humans are very interesting to us, but we are discouraged from interacting with them, so when one traipses into our office, it's hard not to stare."

My finger was forgotten for a moment in professional curiosity.

"What did you do for the time you didn't have anybody?"

"Oh, we just printed stuff out and rescanned it, or wrote our passwords down so we wouldn't have to reset them, things like that. We're quite clever, so we always find a workaround," he winked.

I gaped this time in nerd horror. 

"You...print it out, and then...rescan it?" I asked slowly. He nodded happily, seeming to think I was praising him for his outside-the-box thinking. 

I sighed. The horror of my finger-less skin crotch was fading. She'd give it back, according to Charlie, right? So. No big deal. Regular Thursday, I thought manically.

"I'm going to be here all day," I grumbled.

I was in fact there all day, due some to the fact that my typing prowess was cut, but mostly due to the fact that being tech-less for seemingly years had crippled their offices. 

I fixed printers, internet privileges, multi-monitor clusterfucks, and rewrote their entire active directory tree. By the end of the day, I had somewhat of a following, two or three employees always by my side asking questions. 

"Uh, no, there aren't any Nigerian prince's that actually need money. I know you've probably got more than you know what to do with, but you should put that towards a charity or something."

"Ah, no, there are no creatures that live in printers," I paused at this one actually, due to an experience I had with my buddy Nathan a while back, "uh, normally. It's either laser or ink."

"Oh, no, Mailer-daemon isn't an actual demon. It's uh, kind of hard to explain but it's just a program running on a mail server."

At one point, I had a pointy eared accountant very interested in active directory 'trees', but after explaining there were no actual trees involved, they seemed to lose interest. 

I installed anti-phishing software and scheduled a meeting to discuss email security, buffed their printer processes and updated the firmware on all their servers. 

By the time 5pm had rolled around, most of them were looking at me with awed admiration, which I'm kind of used to from non-technical users, but not so much from one's who's eyes glow in the dark and who have the ability to THIEVE fingers. 

I hadn't seen Monica all day, despite keeping an eagle eye for her around my supernatural crowd of admirers. That might sound nice, but I could definitely tell half of them wanted to put me in a jar. That kind of admiration, I can do without. 

But finally, as I was packing up the last of my gear into my poor, abused duffel, I caught a red blur coming around the corner and leapt. 

"MONICA," I yelled. 

She flinched back, a surprised look on her face. 

"What is it, Dear?" she asked motherly, concerned. 

"My. Finger." I said through gritted teeth. 

"Yes, I'm bringing it back to you," she smiled sweetly, blowing another kiss elegantly in my direction.

I felt a slight burning and waved my hand around to cool it before clutching one hand with the other and squeezing like I'd been cut. 

I saw my original finger, right back where it was supposed to be. It didn't look any different, but the sizzling feeling didn't subsize, simply dulled a bit and began to travel. 

I cried out as the burning intensified at my wrist, burning it's way up through my veins and clutching it's intense grasp on my shoulder. In over my neck and down through my whole body, finally the heat subsided, seeming to settle. 

Monica seemed troubled by my cries, rushing over to hold my shoulders. 

"Oh, I'm so sorry, Dear! I didn't know it would hurt! It doesn't hurt us," she finished weakly. 

I was panting, trying to come down from the panic. The heat had felt so intense at one point, I thought I might burst into flames, melt into their corporate carpet. 

I straightened slowly, brushing my hands down my waist. I snapped my head back to give her a piece of my mind instead of a piece of my hand, but her peach lips were furled in a concerned frown, and I just couldn't bring myself to scold her. I came into their environment, after all. You don't reprimand a tiger if a kid falls in his cage. 

"Uh, it seems to be okay, now," damn her crystal eyes. I couldn't even be mad now, gazing up into their clear emerald color, "What did you do?"

"Oh, I just put a little magic in there," she smiled, "I only do this for those I like. You did wonderful work for us today, and I'd love to have you back."

I eyed her up and down. 

"Okay, but no more body part removal. I appreciate the juicing, but I'm just a person, I don't know what use I'd really have for magic. I don't even know how to use it, it could be dangerous for the people around me."

She smiled widely, the radiance causing my eyes to squint like I were looking into the sun. 

"Piper, you worry about others even as your body just becomes whole again?" she cooed in that Romanian lilt, "I think you're closer to our realm than you think."

"Ha, okay," I tried to compose myself, failing miserably, shaking as I scooped my duffel off the ground. 

She leaned in and I flinched, but she simply laid a plump kiss on my forehead. I felt my cheeks blaze and I stared up at her, my hand on my chest in some kind of southern belle modesty pose.

Her laugh twinkled as she walked away and I rushed outside, trying to calm my speeding heartbeat. 

As I loaded up and hopped into the bucket seat of my truck, I remembered the last rule and flicked a glance at my watch. 

5:58. Just in time, I thought, with satisfaction. I mulled over that rule, wondering it's purpose. No one in the place seemed too purposefully dangerous, even Monica seeming to think she was giving me a gift. Maybe vampires? Or some other kind of ethereal creature who got cranky at 6pm?

Shaking my head, I started up the truck, deciding I probably didn't want to know, when I head a loud snap of thunder. 

The tall grey offices I'd just come out of seemed to shine, vibrating slightly, a half-circle rainbow sparkling over the corners. 

As I watched, it simply fizzled out, slowly fading from reality, leaving a barren field in it's place, not even an imprint of the building. 

I was still gaping, swiveling my head around to see if anyone else was seeing this. But the parking lot was enourmous and empty, all cars that had previously been parked having fizzled out as well. 

Shivering, wondering what would have happened to me had I still been in the building when it flashed out, I put the truck in drive and sped away, still cradling my returned finger. 

As my senses came back and the panic died down, a question nagged at the back of my mind. 

How did she know my name?
