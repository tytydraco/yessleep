ALERT, ALERT we are going down’ the pilot screams. ‘Please Jesus save us, I am begging’ he pleads down the intercom. So the pilot was no help. 
‘WE’RE ALL GOING TO DIE’ shrieks a passenger, who if I hadn’t looked at I would have easily mistaken for a banshee. ‘JESUS SAVE U-’ THUD. Then all that was left was darkness. 

‘Erghhhh’ I stir, as I start to come to my senses, all I see is fire and sand, some sand had been super-heated into glass because the fire was blazing the sand to an extreme heat, which would explain the cuts I have, but wait why is there a fire? And why is there a lot of people sleeping on the floor. 
I ran over, shaking what looked like a businesswoman, but as I took a closer look her jaw had been separated from her body, and it looked like chunks and chunks of her guts where missing, I instantaneously gag and vomit. What happened to them? What happened to Us? 

I go around one by one to see whether there are any signs of life, all of them had, had chunks taken out of them, probably because of the fire. I go around at least 4 times checking to see whether any of them are alive to no avail, they are all ‘asleep’.

‘URGHHHHH’ I hear, I sprint towards the noise to see the half human half banshee woman waking up, ‘URGHHH’ she moans. She looks at me and I look at her as she says, ‘I told you we were all going to die’, she then laughs, coughs and dies once more. 

I was furious, was this some sort of sick joke, I do not know how I got here or where I am, all I know is that something happened, and a lot of people are dead because of it. Was it me? Did I kill them?

Surely not my poor weak muscles could not kill anyone, I can barely swat a fly, never mind a whole human. So that means something, killed us all, maybe a bear? No, that wouldn’t explain the fire. Maybe some sort of angry God? Who would be so cruel?  

I look around for clues, grasping at anything that might mean human life. All I had found was a twig that looked funny, it looked like a flute with no holes, like the hollowness of bamboo but with a normal stick.  

What felt like hours, I carry on walking, I see something, something that I had dreamed off, fire! There was a distant fire! Not the one near the mysterious dead bodies but a distant one in the centre of the island. I have no choice but to run as fast as my twig legs could carry me. 

As I get closer and closer, I hear a lot of loud drums, this could mean there is multiple people. I'm saved. 
When I get closer, I see a bright, beautiful, roaring fire and people dancing around it and singing a funny little song, on the fire there was meat and fruit getting cooked to be eaten.

It was almost too good to be true. 

I walked over and try to talk to one of the people, they were funny looking, they were not wearing normal clothes, they were wearing stuff made out of twigs and leaves and had face paint on. 

They said something in apparent gibberish, and everyone had stopped dancing and turned to look at me. My face went red as I told them to carry on. They all smiled and grabbed me and sat me down at a table. Basically, force feeding me delicious meat and fruit, I was going to ask how they made the meat, but they didn’t speak English. 

The people of this small village where kind and very inviting. They kept on feeding me and feeding me, until it felt like my belly was about to burst.  

Later on, they indicated me to the biggest hut there was, inside there where paintings of a man who looked like he had conquered around 50 people and had left them on the floor to die. He went round making sure each one was dead because he was the one to vanquish them. Later on in the paintings it shows him sharing some food with the village, sharing his strength, and then disappearing. I thought it was a beautiful story and thought that these people where caring.  

When I had turned back to the village people they had disappeared and closed the door behind them. I tried to open the door, but I was trapped I heard the word ‘Ignis’ be said outside before the whole room lit on fire. I'm guessing the reason why they’re meat was so good was because they like to slow cook it, I've been in here for two hours writing this story, I have barely any oxygen left, so if anyone reads this, if there is a strange village and you don’t know where you are or what is happening. 

DO NOT GO TO IT.
