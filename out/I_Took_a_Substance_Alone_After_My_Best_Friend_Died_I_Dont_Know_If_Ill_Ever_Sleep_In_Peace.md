A few months ago, my best friend died in a road accident. Just like that. One second he was alive, the next he was a name in a phone call and a framed photo on someone’s shelf. People told me to “grieve properly,” but no one tells you how to do that when your brain feels like it’s been put through a paper shredder.

I wasn’t sleeping. I wasn’t really existing—just floating in this dull fog where nothing felt real. A few weeks before, at a party, someone gave me a tab of LSD. I’d never done psychedelics before. I didn’t even know what I was saving it for… until one weekend, when my parents were asleep in the other room, I decided I’d had enough of the numbness. I took it.

It started out calm. Gentle waves. Music felt like silk on my skin. My walls swirled with color. I laughed for the first time in weeks. I thought I’d made the right choice.

But then something shifted.

It wasn’t a slow transition. It was like falling through ice.

I looked at my phone. I had opened the voice note my best friend had sent me the week before he died. Just him laughing about something stupid. I replayed it. And again. And again. Each time it sounded more hollow. Then slower. Then deeper. Eventually it didn’t sound like him at all—just this slow, wet, gurgling sound like someone trying to laugh while drowning.

I turned the phone off. The screen stayed on.

The voice kept playing.

I looked up, and that’s when I saw him.

Or something that looked like him.

He was standing in the corner of my room. Head tilted too far sideways, mouth open like it had been dislocated, teeth far too many. But it wasn’t just the image—it was the presence. My body reacted before my brain could. Every hair stood up. My chest tightened like something was being twisted inside me.

He didn’t blink. Just stood there. Watching me.

I tried to stand but my legs didn’t work right—they bent the wrong way. I crawled, literally crawled across the floor like some wounded animal. I kept blinking, hoping he’d vanish. He didn’t.

Then he moved.

But not like walking. More like frame by frame, glitching closer every time I looked away. And the closer he got, the more I saw—his skin was covered in what looked like road rash. Bits of gravel stuck in his face. Glass in his hair. His eyes… weren’t his. They were mine.

At some point I blacked out. Or maybe I just dissociated so hard I stopped being aware of time. I ended up under my desk, curled up, rocking back and forth. I bit my hand at some point—left a bruise that lasted a week. I kept whispering, “It’s not real. It’s not real. It’s not real,” but my voice didn’t sound like mine either. It was his. Or whatever that thing was pretending to be him.

I stayed under the desk until sunlight came through the blinds. Even then, I didn’t come out right away. I just stared at the wall, convinced it was still breathing.

It wasn’t a ghost. It wasn’t a demon. It was my brain, twisted inside out by grief and chemicals. That thing I saw? That was my friend, run through the filter of trauma and raw fear. A hallucination, yes—but also a mirror. That was how my mind interpreted what happened to him. And it scared me more than anything else ever has.

I’ve never taken another drug since.

Sometimes, late at night, when I catch my reflection too quickly in a dark room… I remember the way he stood. Tilted. Silent. Watching. Part of me is still under that desk, I think.

Don’t take LSD when you’re grieving. You won’t find peace. You’ll find pieces—of your mind, your fear, your guilt—and you might not be able to put them back where they belong
