The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was a vast expanse of white. The sheer geometry of the sight almost broke my mind. Impossible shapes spiraled and twisted out before me forming structures that defied all of my knowledge and instinct. There were rotating spirals confined to pure white squares. Buildings were rotating but at the same time staying still. All of the structures were massive and appeared in all directions neglecting the rules of the world I knew. The most strange sight of all appeared when my eyes met the horizon. Immense pure white pillars stretched up as far as the eye could see. They did not care about the idea of a sky and seemed to stretch beyond it. Their rectangular form constantly held the same width even though I intuitively knew that the further away parts should appear smaller. 

The white all around me seemed as absorbent as black, refusing to reflect anything. I wobbled my first few steps in this world but despite my awkward movements it felt as though I was being held upright. I continued to move but to me it appeared as if everything else moved at a rate slightly brisker than my walk. I continued moving through the ocean of white but my only reference for change was the writhing mass of impossible structures surrounding me. The pillars in the distance still retained a constant size. Even after I moved for what felt like hours, I saw them the same as I had when I first awoke. Every step changed nothing but the hypnotizing mass. 

I began to tire on my journey. To give myself credit, I had been going for what felt like days. My body didn’t seem to accumulate any strain and over the course of my journey I found that I had no need for food, water, or any of the other draws which my body once desired. I had learned that I could not fatigue but I felt drained nonetheless. This feeling was difficult for me because I could not place it. I thought of myself like water in a lake rippling in the wind. If I had to guess, I may dislike being water. That identity couldn’t possibly align with the concepts in this brilliant world. I moved for another few days playing on these thoughts when I finally took a rest. The pillars in the distance were still visually the same distance away, but I knew intuitively that they were closer to me now than ever before. When I finally stopped moving it felt unnatural, as though the force pushing me forward was still applied and I was resisting it. The resistance felt easy and the rest was still appreciated. For the first time on my journey I felt a deep sense of relaxation throughout my body. 

I may have sat there for years. The time didn’t really matter to me at this point. The relaxation was beautiful but after a time the flow managed to dislodge me and push me onward. The rest of my journey was largely unremarkable. The relaxation left me refreshed, and as I moved the writhing world began to make sense. I started telling the differences between some of the absolute whites, and identifying the patterns in some of the shapes. This understanding only grew as I continued to walk. 

After decades, I knew I had arrived. The pillars in the distance still remained at their place on the horizon but the force pushing me had completely ebbed. I sat for a while before the world staged its first abrupt interruption. A jolt of light coursed through my skin. My body tensed, urging me to look upwards. A beautiful face stared down at me. Its brilliant eyes were bright with impossible shades of color which again bent my concept of reality. I cannot describe the features as anything other than perfect. It was the ideal being born of this world, it didn’t care about myself or my concepts so it made its own, and they worked perfectly. I continued to stare until I was disrupted. The world spoke to me in a satisfying vibration. 

“I am what you called God, you have traversed my realm. All that is left on your part is to flourish in your eternal joy.”

I blinked once and opened my eyes to a vast expanse of white. The sheer geometry of the shapes almost broke my mind. My thoughts the deity and my travels quickly flitted away.

I surveyed my surrounding and my eyes landed on incomprehensibly dimensioned pillars looming in the distance. I began to unsteadily move.
