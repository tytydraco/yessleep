[Update](https://old.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dbbmm5/update_my_friend_was_being_ignored_and_left_out/?)


Sarah and Sandra dragged me back into the hallway. I begged to be let go, but they continued as the other three walked behind. After about a minute of being dragged, the girls stopped at a door labeled, 1-32. Jessica and the other two went in, then came back out, each holding two jars. Sarah and Sandra pushed me backwards onto the floor, then walked by the other three as they closed their eyes and smashed the jars onto the ground. They turned around and sprinted away, with Sarah and Sandra sprinting behind. Great. I closed my eyes and stood up. I wanted to run right after them, but a loud bang startled my eyes open, and I saw one of those bugs in the corner of my eye.


I jumped, instinctively looking at the thing. I noticed there were six of them crawling all over the carpet, lightly tearing it up as they moved. My heart sank, a deep chill overtook me. I turned around and sprinted for my sanity. There was no way those things would catch up to me, but there was also no way I was going to be allowed out of this place. I turned a corner, then another. Once I made it to the end of the hallway, the lights went out. My adrenaline shot up.


I felt around for an unlocked door, my nerves wracking more so each time a handle failed to budge. Eventually, I found a door I could push open. I sped into the room, then pushed the door shut. It wasn't long before a terrible stench hit me, like nobody had cleaned the room in weeks. It was my only choice. I sat down, back up against the door, burying my head in my arms and legs. I was worried for myself, but I was especially worried about my friend. Where was she? What was happening to her? I could only guess something terrible was happening.


This was the only time any girl had ever been cruel to me. It was odd to get such stereotypically feminine punishments. Well, the hammer thing was probably the only stereotypically masculine punishment, as anything done with the upper body is stereotypically masculine. Escapist processing aside, as I sat in the bathroom, I had no idea what to do. I sat in there for what felt like hours, having to endure the horrid smell. At some point, the lights switched back on. I looked straight ahead, noticing a line-up of four bathroom stalls. They all had writing on them. Bored out of my mind, I went over to read some of it:


“Not my friends.”


“I don't know why I have to be here. All I know is, my friends aren't my friends. I don't think they ever were.”


“They beat my friend into a coma. Why did they feel the need to do that? Just why?”


“I don't want to see those bugs again. I don't want to see those bugs again. I don't want to see those bugs again.”


“I hate this place so much.”


“I'm not a slut for wearing stuff I wear for comfort and self love.”


“They hit me with baseball bats and scratched my childhood DVDs right in front of me.”


“Do they do this to boys?”


“If I ever get out of this building, who do I call about the bugs? I know where they're from, but it sounds too crazy.”


Standing closer to the stalls, I noticed some drawings here and there. They all had repeated themes and were clearly drawn by different people. Black dots, five flaming people, and circles within squares with one horizontal line through the center. There were also a ton of scratch marks.


At some point, I used one of the toilets. As I flushed, I noticed a dried up reddish brown splatter on the floor, to the left of the toilet. I gagged. I've seen stuff like that before... whatever happened there could not have been pretty. I did not want to go mad, I just wanted to get out of this rancid building and be far away from the girls. I got right out of the stall, washed my hands and face, then contemplated my next move. Running while staring up at the ceiling was risky, as the bugs could be sitting up there. Running with my eyes shut would be worse considering how I am with implications. I had to do something, so I chose the second option. I reminded myself of the blood splatter, closed my eyes, then bolted out of the bathroom.


I felt along wall on my way through the hallway. I jumped and nearly froze at every bump. I put my weight on every step, ready to stomp any mentally deactivating bugs. Just after the first corner, the smell of gasoline hit my nose. I kept moving, but it wasn't long before I couldn't stand straight. My breaths were shallow. I was getting more and more disoriented. Eventually, I collapsed.


I awoke in a small room. It was empty, aside from one girl sitting to my left. It was Alice. Her face was bruised up, hands cut in a couple spots. Her eyes were pointed at me, watering up. A pit formed in my stomach. I wasn't going to let any of that happen to me.


“Alice!? Tell me what happened!”


Alice groaned. My blood boiled. I stood up, then walked over to the door. With every bit of anger, I body-slammed the door. Hopefully the psychopaths would come over, so I could persuade them to talk. After about 10 minutes, I was on the ground, catching my breaths. The door handle clicked, then Sarah stepped in.


“Are you tired?”


My adrenaline was too high for me give up. I picked myself up, then ran into her. I grabbed her arm, pulling her to the ground. I sat on her neck, then just let everything out. “Why… are you… doing this to us? Tell me what your problem is, you freak!”


She was struggling. “Get off of me!”


“Not until you tell me why you're ignoring us. We can fix this if you just talk!”


“Alice… she’s a toxic fake friend.”


“Is that why she's never been fake to me!? Let alone torture me like you clearly just tortured her!? I don't trust you. You're the one who's fake.”


“If she's responding like that, we know what their problem is.”


I looked over at Alice. “What is it?”


“They have some biased negative idea about me, I guess.”


That made the most sense out of any possibility. They just came up with some negative ideas about her, while she was minding her own business. I didn't want to know why they'd resort to everything they've done so far, so I got off of Sarah. I stood by her head as she stood up. I was at a loss about what might happen next. Was she going to retaliate? I noticed a bottle of pepper spray on in her back pocket, then saw Jessica turn a distant corner, carrying a hammer. I didn't care anymore. I grabbed Sarah by the neck, putting her in a chokehold, then bringing her back to the floor. I grabbed the pepper spray, then ducked into the room. I grabbed Alice by the arm and helped her up. As I exited the room, I sprayed Sarah in the face, leaving her covering her eyes in pain.


Walking through the hallway, Jessica was speeding towards us. I sprayed her, then she dropped her hammer and covered her eyes. I grabbed her hammer, then went for the double doors at the end of the hallway. Alice was nearly tripping over herself. I glanced at her, but she shook her head and told me she was okay.


Meters from the double doors, the lights went out. I slowed my pace, but felt for the doors, managing to bust through them and enter the lobby. I took a right, feeling around for the boards covering the exit doors. Once I felt the wood of the boards, I let Alice go, then struck the board again and again until light started seeping into the room. I smashed the board up, creating a hole almost big enough for me to climb through. As I continued, the lights came back on. I heard some voices. One of them sounded like Sandra. I kept going at the board. Once the hole was big enough, I grabbed Alice, then pushed the door open. All I could see ahead of me was a patch of gravel and a forest. Alice and I sped away. I still had no idea where we were, and I wasn't recognizing this place from the outside either. We ducked into the nearby trees, continuing our getaway.


Some time later, we reached a gas station. There, I called the police. Once they arrived, I told them everything. Alice got the help she needed, then we were brought back to my home. There was no word on what was happening to those psychopaths yet, and I was eager to find out.


Alice and I sat on the couch, settling down after all that had happened. Alice’s brows were furrowed. I told her to let it out. She turned to me.


“They told me to keep the videos from their old YouTube channel. I didn't know better yet back then, but I did know not to say the stuff they said.”


“What did they say?”


Alice showed me three videos. In the first one, Sarah is joking around with the others. They all refer to people they dislike as… well… the n-word… In the second one, Jessica and Sandra are walking along a sidewalk on a sunny day. They both talk about how they tripped a blind person for fun the previous day. In the third one, the girls were using transphobic slurs to mock each other. Alice gave a look of disgust and told me she wasn't aware of what those words meant at the time, and was glad she didn't end up using them herself. It was sickening, and it was on top of all the stuff they've done to Alice and I. Alice looked at me. “I kinda want to share these around the internet.”


I watched her post the incriminating videos, then send them to every one of her ex-friends’ friends. Her ex-friends commented on the videos, asking her why she'd do this… Alice responded with this: “don't pretend you didn't ignore and humiliate me, you psycho. Now that I've posted these videos, you're done.” She then blocked them. One managed to respond before getting blocked.


“You were calling me fat.”


Alice had a look of disgust on her face. “Why the… why would I ever do that?” She deleted the comment, then blocked her.


With no word on Alice’s ex-friends, I contacted the police to ask them about it. During some back and forth, I was told to be patient. The girls are being investigated, and if any incriminating evidence is found, the right actions will be taken.
