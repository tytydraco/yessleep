As I walked down the block, I saw Rocco sitting in front of the bar smoking a cigar with another friend of ours, Jack. The two of them saw me and stood up. 

I felt around my jacket, I still had a pistol sewn into my jacket in only a way I could access. Came in handy a bunch, and it’d come in handy now. 

As I kept walking closer, we just stared at each other. No one said or did anything. As I got to the door, Rocco stood in front of me. “Get the fuck outta here. You ain’t welcome here. You made your bed, fucking lay down in it!” 

I didn’t have the energy to push past him, but I still ran my mouth: “Then fucking move me.” 

Jack just stared at us, but Rocco shook his head. “Carlo, there’s orders on high not to touch you. Boss sent out a guy specifically for you.”

“Then let me fucking talk to him, goddamnit!” I stomped my foot on Rocco’s, and as he leaned over in pain, I quickly pulled the hidden gun from my jacket and shot into his abdomen. Jack started fishing for his gun, but I took him out. I walked into the bar, and was met by three men, each had their guns out and pointed at me. 

Then the boss, Georgie, came out from his his back room and told the guys to stand down. I followed him into the room. Two other big men were in there, muscle that I didn’t know the names of. 

“Carlo, you gotta lotta balls comin’ back here after what you did,” said the boss. 

“Georgie,” I started, “cut the shit. I don’t care anymore. What the fuck did you send after me?” 

Georgie started laughing and picked up a cigar. “I’ve been trying something new for the last year and it’s worked great. Had to make one payment, and now I got true power on my payroll.” 

“That doesn’t answer shit, what the fuck is this… THING?” I started shaking in the seat. 

“Carlo, you were always more than just a soldier. I trusted you with big hits. You were strong, pragmatic, and goddamned capable. You took out half a fucking crew from Philadelphia, those animal fucks. You put down some thugs that took a shipment from us. The cop. Your brother in law, Bobby. That son of a bitch took money from me. ME! I trusted you with it all, and you broke. You turned.” 

The boss lit up his cigar, took a few puffs, then continued. “I’m not gonna lie, I was afraid to send anyone after you, especially after that moron Rocco got his panties in a twist and made a scene. If he had coke to me quietly that’s one thing, but he alerted ya, gave ya a chance to run. That fucked things up more.” 

“Goddamnit Georgie what the fuck is this? I’m not asking again!” 

Georgie put his cigar down and pointed at the two men standing at the other side of the room. They pulled out guns. “No threats in here, you won’t be able to follow through. Now, where was I? Right, now that poor prick has a bullet in his gut, and the other one’s dead. I didn’t care for either of them, in fact Jack was cheating on my niece and Rocco was a useless drunk. Their capo was planning to take care of them anyway, you just made it easier and sooner.” 

Georgie picked his cigar back up and resumed puffing on it. I looked at the two other men, they had their guns pointed at me still. 

“Carlo, listen. I got a friend, a good friend of mine, who does some strange shit. Shit that opened up a new world for me. And this friend of mine got me in contact with this… thing that’s after you. That’s all I’m gonna fuckin’ say. Otherworldly shit.” 

The realization had flooded in me. The red skies, the torture, the decrepit look. This wasn’t a normal monster, it was a goddamned demon. “You sent a fucking demon after me, didn’t you? It sent me to hell, it showed me traumatic shit over and fucking over again. Is that it? Is that what that fucking thing is? You sent hell itself after me?” 

Georgie looked at me and smirked, then took out a bottle of brandy from a drawer in his desk. He placed a glass for himself on the table and poured some Brandy in it. He placed the cigar down and took a drink, gulping down the alcohol and shuddering after. “I needed something you deserved. Look at you now, nothing. Get the fuck outta my office.” 

The two men picked me up and tossed me out the front door. Rocco and Jack were left outside, their blood stained the floor. Civilians crowded across the street. I could hear sirens in the distance. I ran off towards the nearest Church, and got onto the steps, but the monster grabbed me. “Not in there, you slippery fuck!” The monster yanked me back and threw me to the floor. I heard the sirens, then the world spun. Then it went dark….

It’s been sixteen months since that day with my boss, and it’s been a goddamned blur. Arrest, charges, and speaking with the feds. I told them about the monster, demon, whatever-the-fuck, and they remanded me to a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane. 

After a year there, they saw how nicely I was progressing, and that I had no more mention of the monster. I was transferred to a medium security prison. 

I haven’t seen nor heard anything of the demon. Maybe I am crazy. But as I look at the scars along my back and arms, and remember seeing my brother get ripped in front of me, I know I didn’t imagine that shit. Even my boss admitted he needed to take me out in a special way. 

But with the lack of his presence here, and how much better I’ve felt, and everyone calling me crazy… I still got some doubts. Regardless, I’ve been trying to turn shit around in here. I got a lotta time to serve, and there ain’t a lot of connections from my previous life, so I feel relatively safe. I started classes in here, I’m getting my GED. 

Things have been nice and normal. Or, well, they were. Every so often now I’ll see that bastard in the corner of my eye, disguised as another inmate or a guard. But just for a split second. 

Then one day, I kept hearing the demon, his raspy laugh. As I finished my studying in the library, a guard came up to me to bring me back to my cell. As we arrived at my cell, the guard smiles, revealing yellowed, sharp teeth. His skin turns a sickly gray, and his eyes a beady black. 

“I told you Carlo, no one would believe you. Now it’s time to collect the rest of my bounty.” 

The demon reached in his back pocket, took a scalpel out, and plunged it into my neck. The world went black.
