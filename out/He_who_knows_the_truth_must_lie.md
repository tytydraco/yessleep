The 10 commandments of Derek’s Repairs:  

-Derek’s Repairs values its customers, and so should you.  

-It is forbidden to decline or hang up calls.  

-Employees may not make outgoing calls, including 911, except to the helpdesk.  

-Queries during work are to be sent to the helpdesk.  

-Unlabelled food items in the office are free for consumption. Label your own items.  

-In the event of an unusual emergency, contact the helpdesk and follow instructions.  

-Clean your desk after leaving. Leave it as you found it.  

-Keith may not enter the building. If Keith doesn’t leave, call the helpdesk.  

-Lucidity during work is paramount. Keep your head.  

-You will be marked for termination if you are found in violation of any commandment.  

  

These were the rules written on the whiteboard my manager showed me when I was hired. He sounded almost embarrassed, unsuccessfully attempting to supress his stuttering.  

“These a-are our 10 commandments, and you have to f-follow all of them as b-best you can if you’re on nightshift. Derek will be furious if you d-don’t.”  

As I read the “commandments” for the first time, I had a million questions.  

“Sir, if I may?”  

“You may, but stop calling me Sir. This isn’t the m-military.”  

“Understood. I was wondering why we’re not allowed to call 911 inside the building. And what is Keith all about.”  

“Quite f-frankly, I don’t know, but I wouldn’t risk angering Derek. He’s from another generation y-you know.”  

Asking questions seemed to make the man uneasy. It’s clear that he knows more than he’s letting on, but his fear of Derek sits deep, thus getting any more information out of him would be just as difficult as teaching a blind monkey how to manage a nuclear power plant by using sign language. The manager kept looking back at the door, clearly ready to leave, but too polite to just walk out. His mood quickly improved as I said  

“Got it. Should we move on?”  

“Yes, let's go. But remember that the commandments...”  

He paused for a moment.  

“Especially that thing with Keith... Derek will kill you.”  

With that, we left the room and quickly finished the office-tour.  

  

Over the next 3 or 4 months I worked the evening shift, taking calls from our valued customers with brains smooth enough to be used as hockey pucks for games on sandpaper instead of ice. I once had a guy calling for a broken siphon which would leak water. He’d put a bucket underneath, catching the water same as you and I would, but this guy was a special breed of Idiot. He’d take the full bucket of water, empty it into the same broken sink, and restart the process. He called after doing that 4 times and threatened to call a lawyer if we didn’t send someone “right now”. This was the call that convinced me to switch to the nightshift.  

As I arrived for my first night, I found the office devoid of people. The only sign of life; a single note on my desk, with a piece of chocolate on top.  

“He who knows the truth, must lie.”  

In a swift motion I ate the chocolate and pondered what the message could mean. Obviously, my mind immediately jumped to the conclusion that it was a prank and that the meaning of the message would reveal itself as the night went on, but which conclusion did the author want me to draw from it? They would probably call throughout the night to scare me hoping I'll go crazy, but if I’d figure out the meaning and wouldn’t let them get to me, I might earn some brownie points with the other night-shifters while avoiding the boredom of watching the clock tick by.  

I started my PC just as I would in the evening shift. I open MS Teams, open quicksupport and send Derek the code, and finally open notepad. 

I was just winning a clash royale match when the first call interrupted me. I sighed. 

“You’ve reached Derek’s Repairs where some guy does your DIY. How can I help you?” 

“I need a plumber.” 

There was a short pause. 

“Erm, what’s your address sir?” 

“Bunny Rabbit Drive 15-OX” 

As I was writing down the address, I noticed the far corner of my office growing darker and the light from my computer becoming almost blinding. 

“Just to confirm it’s Bunny Rabbit-” 

He interrupted me, his voice booming through my headset with a fury yet unmatched. 

“POR-TO-LE-VEL-DRIVE-15-0-6! I don’t have time for this!” 

“Got it sir. What is the Issue?” 

“The Issue is a century old waterpipe flooding my basement! Send someone NOW!” 

“Ok I got it sir, have a-” 

He hung up. Thank God. 

As I sent the notepad file to the technician's office, the walls around me began shift as if they were breathing. I sat there for the longest time, not sure if the movement was real. I blinked and the walls began to pulse in a frenzy, closing distance rapidly as I ran out into the hallway. From the outside, somehow, my office looked perfectly normal again. Was this a case for the helpdesk?  

“CLICK!” 

The deafening noise echoed from the main entrance. I turned to see the hallway stretch for miles, culminating in a black void. Going back into my office was impossible for now, the walls were probably still awake. A silly thought in hindsight, yet at the time it seemed like a simple fact, a law of nature. With nothing else to do, I began walking down the hallway and soon found the main entrance to our offices; A white, imposing, fireproof metal door. At this moment the door looked like a massive, indestructible gate keeping intruders out. I blinked, and I was at the other end of the hallway. Again, I walked back down, but it seemed longer this time, more exhausting. The door appeared out of the dark once more, motivating me to sprint like I've never before. As reached for the handle... back I was. 

An object in motion stays in motion, and so did I as I was wandering down that hallway for a thousand lifetimes, over and over again. If only I could remember the other part of that quote... 

It stays in motion unless... unless... unless... 

I kept moving on autopilot, thinking for years. 

Unless... motion... something else... 

I was drawn in by the end of the hallway, my vision zooming into a single, infinitely small singularity. My thoughts were now as loud concert and clear as day. 

A N  O B J E C T  I N  M O T I O N  S T A Y S  I N  M O T I O N  U N L E S S   A C T E D  U P O N  B Y  A N  E X T E R N A L  F O R C E ! 

And suddenly I ran. I ran for my life to reach that door, not daring to blink, not stopping until I ran into it, and my body collapsed onto the ground.  

I woke up in front of Derek’s office, a dim table light illuminating the workspace. I entered, my head throbbing, legs shaking. In an instant I sat in his chair, his laptop open in front of me, requesting a password. I looked down and noticed that my clothes were gone, replaced with the immaculate suit Derek keeps in his office wardrobe. I looked right, to a picture of Derek with his son at a football match. Then left to a trophy on the shelf. 

“To our greatest captain: Mason Brink” 

I typed in the name but no luck. Did I miss something? Another look at the picture revealed something scribbled beneath. 

“The Unicycling Unicorns (Class 6c) 7:1 The Slayers of Behemoths (Class 6A), 1999” 

As I did the math to figure out Mason’s year of birth, I felt like a quantum supercomputer attempting to uncover the greatest secrets of the universe, revealing an earthshattering truth upon completion of my calculations. I am the infinity machine, and Mason was born in 1987. The password is Mason1987, I typed it in, and it worked. 

There was only one thing to do now; call the helpdesk. I sat there for the longest time, terror, pain and boredom intertwining into a singular, desperate need for help as the dial tone kept reverberating throughout my mind. I jumped as Derek’s voice commanded the office back into normalcy. 

“Derek’s Repairs, Mr. Brink speaking.” 

Of course, the boss would be the only one not saying our stupid motto. 

“I need help... erm I'm TJ from customer support and something is wrong with the office! It keeps changing!” 

“Calm down son, what happened?” 

“It’s insane! The walls are awake and the hallway is infinite! I need to get out of here!” 

I kept rambling in a panic and Derek listened. 

“Did you break any of the commandments?” 

I thought for a moment, trying to figure out what I could have done wrong as Derek spoke again. 

“Tell me everything you remember from tonight. Start to finish.” 

“I saw your note on the desk, thought it was a prank but-” 

“What note?” 

“The erm... the one about liars.” 

Derek paused for a moment, not making a noise. 

“Was there anything else? Maybe a phone number you called?” 

“There was some chocolate.” 

“Don’t you dare tell me you ate that!” 

“Well... I don’t quite remember...” 

“Fuck! The note... you ate a labelled item, one not free for consumption. Anything else you did?” 

“I uhm, I don’t think so.” 

“Good, let's keep it that way, we don’t want a situation we can’t handle. How long ago did you eat the chocolate?” 

“I don’t know, it feels like I did it lifetimes ago.” 

Derek was thinking again. 

“That means he could come at any moment...” 

“Keith?” 

There was a pause, followed by a sigh. 

“He won’t leave, you already broke a commandment... Go into my office and open the top right drawer on my desk. You’ll be safe, trust me.” 

With that, he hung up. I opened the drawer to find a writhing silver mass in shape of a revolver. The way in which the mercury looking substance moved radiated elegance and power as well as entropy and uncertainty. The wooden grip felt comfortable in my hand, yet I couldn’t help but think about those who’ve held this gun before me. Who were these people, and what did they use it for? Was it just a rich man’s toy, or is this thing responsible for innocent deaths? Did these things even matter? Because ultimately, just like an employee, this gun was just a means to an end. 

I looked up and my eyes widened in horror; the walls were awake again. It looked like human faces and hands have fused into a single horrific mass, slowly consuming the office and everything within. I closed my eyes and dove for the open door, gun in hand, yet I never felt myself hit the ground. Instead, I opened my eyes to find myself back in my office with the gun on my lap. My screen only gave off a blinding white light, illuminating the room. Looking at the clock didn’t help either, I didn’t even know if it was running forwards, backwards, or if it was working at all. 

I froze as a shrill, high-pitched noise pierced my ears. It came again, sending me to the ground. Whatever was shrieking, it came from the back door. Ripping my headset out of my PC may provide my ears with at least a tiny bit of protection, so that’s what I did. Slowly I crept through the hallway, approaching the back door with utmost caution whilst sticking to the wall to avoid being spotted from the infinity behind me. At this moment I felt like a commando trying to keep a cool head, knowing perfectly well that the enemy was hiding just out of sight with malicious intent.  

Another shriek, I had to stop this thing before it attracted something else that may be bigger or stronger than both of us. 

The back entrance to our office had 2 doors. The first led from the hallway to the staircase, the second was up one flight, made of glass and led to our driveway.  

I opened the first door, and froze. Through the glass of the second door, I saw something resembling a human, but there were obvious giveaways that it was not. It smiled at me with an impossibly wide grin, its teeth glowing as bright as the north star, clearly well taken care of. Skin darker than a black hole contrasted his beige designer suit, radiating a sense of emptiness and false hope. It was saying something inaudible through the glass, never ceasing to smile, even as Derek’s gun appeared in my hand and fired at its own volition, damaging my hearing permanently. The thing fell to the ground and ceased all movement. Blood was streaming from the wound in its stomach, looking like lava flowing down an erupting volcano. I stood there for what felt like hours, watching the blood flow between the cracks of the pavement, moving and taking branching paths as if it were a representation of life itself; ceaseless and determined yet ultimately impermanent as more and more blood disappeared into the ground, eventually leaving a dried red spot behind.  

I turned and was back in my office, the walls still awake, but docile. There was this alien writing, a combination of geometry, faces, and abstract shapes. Somehow, I immediately knew what it said: “You’re a tool.” 

I knew that this text wasn’t just meant for me, but anyone unlucky enough to find themselves working here. Even in this impossible situation, to the world around me I was just some guy working in a call centre for a repair company with 1.3 stars on google reviews. If I had to be a tool, I’d be the best goddamn tool out there, with employers fighting their competitors to hopefully even get a chance of interviewing me, but if I wanted that, I had to start now and call Derek about the thing I assumed was Keith. This time, he didn’t let me wait. 

“Was he there? Did you deal with him?” 

He sounded impatient. 

“I’m pretty sure it was Keith. He stood by the backdoor and... the gun it... shot him... it... But I don’t remember pulling the trigger.” 

“Okay son, you did good. What happened with the body?” 

“Erm, it’s still there I-I didn’t want to touch it. It seemed evil.” 

“Figures... Keith was an evil man. I personally think he came from hell itself... I’ll send someone over to take care of him, there’s no need to worry. Stay in your office until sunrise, you don’t have to stay until 7 today. We’ll talk about that rule break on Monday, understood?” 

“Sir yes sir!” 

Derek hung up, leaving me with my final task of waiting, which I'd complete gladly. My termination was certain, but honestly, every single person, whether they’re of clear mind or not, would quit after an experience like mine, and tell Derek to go fuck himself. I spent my time looking out of the office window at the stars. They seemed more vibrant, more energetic than before, as if the lightbulbs just had to be changed. My ears were attacked once again, this time by the sound of shattering glass as the stars began to fall out of the sky one by one. As the fourth star fell, I heard a repeated banging on the back door, ending in the sound of splitting wood. Something’s here... 

My PC was finally behaving somewhat normally, but still burning my eyes. 

“17 missed calls.” 

Was this a rule break? Surely, I can’t be valuing our customers if I don’t talk to them, so probably yes. But did this count as one or 17 rule breaks? I didn’t have time for this, footsteps could be heard creeping through the hallway along with inaudible whispers; I needed to hide, but where? The actual place didn’t matter, I just needed something quickly. I stood up from my chair, and it squeaked. I froze, and so did the footsteps, leaving the office in silence. There was a sudden yell; “PLEASE! COME OUT HERE! MEOW!” 

It sounded human... almost. Whatever it was, it emphasised the word “please”, repeating it over and over again. 

“P-LEASE APARTMENT! WE KNOW YOU’RE HERE TO GUN OFF A FISH!” 

At this point I was hiding under a table, the nonsensical words waking some sort of ancient instinct to surrender to this creature. As the footsteps resumed, the voice closed in and the whispering became clearer. 

“What wood whirlwinds a man to mew lad?” 

“My goat flow. Get your bum out, don’t fake dances, property a lichen path.” 

There was a tension in the air unlike any other. These creatures were probably trained hunters, judging by the sound of their cold and calculating voices.  

A light shone overhead as the creatures entered my office, scanning the area for me. The last thing I remember from that night was someone shouting the word “DEEZ!”, my body constraining, bright lights, a buzzing sound, and the worst pain of my life.  

I woke in a small room made of concrete. A man stared into my soul through a tiny window in a door, speaking with a thousand voices at once. 

“It’s time.” 

The door opened with a click. I looked down at myself, two rings wrapped around my wrists, keeping my hands in place with a rigid steel bar connecting them. The same thing was also around my ankles, making my movements slow and awkward while I tried to stand up. The man entered my room, pausing before grabbing the bar between my hands and lifting me up. He was carrying a chain by his side, clicking it onto the bar. 

“Follow.”  

He commanded, dragging me out of the room and into a harshly lit hallway. We walked past more rooms like my own, some empty, some filled with horrors beyond my imagination. We walked throughout the building, taking sharp corners and going up multiple flights of stairs, until stopping in front of an office. The man dragged me inside, clicking the steel bar into place into something that looked like a climbing carabiner. 

“Wait” 

With that, he went to leave the room. As the door was about half open, time stopped entirely, leaving me stuck in place as some kind of transparent octopus slowly levitated through the window, stopping in front of me.  

I turned to look at the man again; He was gone and the door was closed. I turned back and another man sat across from me, also frozen in time. The octopus being was in between us, talking directly into my brain. 

“You took a wrong turn, yet your path remains undefined.” 

“What does that even mean? Why can’t things just go back to normal?” 

“What is normal anyway?” 

With that, the outside world became clear through the window. I saw the city, the river, and finally the sky, with clouds being held up by larger octopus like beings, all transparent and barely visible. 

“THIS! What you’re showing me! It’s not quite there but it’s getting there” 

“Is what you see true?” 

My mind was being flooded with only a single sentence. 

“He who knows the truth, must lie.” 

“Will you lie then?” 

I thought for a bit, not quite knowing what to say, so I stayed silent. 

“Let me ask you differently; What is the truth?” 

The lights in the room began to dim to normal levels. 

“I don’t even know anymore...” 

“Will you lie then?” 

I took a bit more time to think about my answer; If I don’t know the truth, I don’t have to lie, but I can’t say the truth either. If I know the truth, I must lie, but I don’t know the truth, so I don’t have to lie, but I can’t say the truth, because I don’t know the truth. 

“Your path is defined.” 

I looked up and the being was gone, along with most of the abnormalities. The only thing that remained was fluid movement on the wooden table and some kind of film grain covering my eyes. Time moved as I knew it before and the man in front of me stood up. 

“Thank you for your time, we’ll see what we can do.” 

The other man entered the office again, taking the chain off the carabiner and dragging me back to the room I woke up in. Everything seemed less imposing now, this was just some kind of police department.  

“Why am I here though? “ 

That is the question I tried to answer for the next 5 days. I came up with a bunch of theories, though I think that the most likely one is also the simplest; I broke the rules and someone got hurt because of it. Derek was probably the one who called the cops on me after hearing what I said over the phone. 

I spent around a month waiting for trial, finally getting to speak to a public defendant. I got lucky with her; her career just started and she was overly motivated to help me out after I told her everything that happened that night. When I told her that the film grain never went away from my eyes, everything clicked for her. She said that it sounded an awful lot like hallucinogen persisting perception disorder or HPPD. It is something you can get after using certain drugs, which causes you to still be tripping after the effects are supposed to have passed. It’s usually nothing drastic, maybe you see movements or patterns that aren’t supposed to be there, maybe the lights turn brighter on a whim, or maybe you get “grey fog”, which is what I was experiencing. 

We came up with a new theory and requested the CCTV from that night. Thankfully, Derek is an Idiot and backed up all footage on an external drive inside his safe. It all started when Derek asked everyone in the office to leave. He then planted the note and piece of chocolate onto my desk. When I ate that piece of chocolate, I was behaving normally for a good half hour before a call came in, that is when I became confused and started staring at the walls in fear.  

We now know what happened, but we don’t know why. I watched that footage over and over again, seeing myself walk up and down the hallway, then suddenly breaking into a sprint and running into the fire door. I saw myself walking into Derek's office, putting on his suit, cracking his password, then taking his gun. I saw myself shooting Keith mercilessly; He was ringing the doorbell and trying to show me his ID. I saw the police breaking the doors and entering the office, looking for me. I got tased and arrested. 

Eventually we found ourselves in front of a court room. Derek was there as well, cuffed to his chair much like I would be soon. We are well prepared to fight for my freedom, but I assume Derek and his lawyer are as well. All I know, is that only one of us will be leaving a free man today and that he who knows the truth, must lie. 

Wish me luck, TJ out.
