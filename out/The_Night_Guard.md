Back when I was studying abroad in Beijing at the turn of the century (okay, 25 years ago, but that doesn't sound quite as dramatic) my friends and I went camping on the Great Wall. We wanted a bit of adventure before the semester ended and we'd exhausted every corner of campus in Haidian, so we decided to take a taxi out to hike up to the unrestored portion of Mutianyu, bring along some packaged food and plenty of alcohol, and spend the night drinking under the stars.

Once we finished the treacherous hike up to the wall, which involved falling portions of stone that nearly crushed our femurs, mountainsides slippery with slimy moss and liquefied caterpillar bodies, and repeatedly losing our way from the nearly-vertical "trail" marked with nothing but water bottles and plastic bags tied to branches, we threw all of our stuff into a semi-sturdy watchtower and tore into our food.

My friend Xun turned to me in between bites of beef jerky. "Do you know the history of the guard towers we're sleeping in?"

I was the only foreigner in the group, and he knew very well I didn't hold a candle to his knowledge of Chinese anthropology or history. I looked forward to his explanation, and I shook my head indicating my ignorance. 

"All I know is they were used to send smoke signals to each other to let the other guards know of approaching invaders."

Xun nodded. "Yep. But that's while the guards were *alive*. What do you think happened once they died?"

Our group paused, caught off guard by Xun's escape from pragmatism. He was never one to indulge in deviations from logic - he was a robotics engineer who'd racked up first place trophies from competitions in seven different countries before he'd turned fifteen. The only reason I'd even crossed paths with him is because I'd gotten lost trying to find the bathroom in the engineering library during orientation week, and he'd given me both directions and pity in the form of a lunch invite where we bonded over our love of yangmei juice and hiking.

"Let me guess - their bodies were used as human shields?" asked Wenjun, another pragmatist, albeit of a more cynical bent.

"I mean...yeah, probably. But let me tell you about one in particular," Xun said, taking a swig of gasoline-scented baijiu and kicking off our festivities for the night in earnest. "My favorite one. Legendary man. Commander Li Ming. He was one of the most prized fighters stationed on the Great Wall, and there are ancient manuscripts detailing how he seemed superhuman in his ability to need so little sleep or nourishment. He kept watch day in and day out when he wasn't actively fighting or training or commanding his troops. His robotic persistence has been an inspiration of mine for most of my life, actually."

We all chuckled at that. Of course Xun's idol wasn't drawn from something as banal as pop culture; he'd somehow found a way to be deep and thoughtful even as a child. I admired the way that the things other people spent a lifetime learning how to do, came naturally to him.

"Anyway, as is the inevitable end to the warrior who fights one battle too many, he was shot down in combat. His final words, as recorded by the army scribe, were that he would never stop protecting his troops." One more swig of shiver-inducingly strong alcohol later, Xun continued: "That night, the invaders overran the portion of the wall he watched over. Troop morale was already down due to Li Ming's death, and after they were captured, things spiraled further. The scribe was, according to his own account, chained to a wall but allowed to record the goings-on so that 'posterity could remember how brutally the Mongols crushed us.'" Xun accentuated this phrase with air quotes.

"The scribe recounted how he was counting down the hours until his own tortuous death, and how difficult it was to concentrate while hearing the wails of his countrymen as they were beaten and tossed over the sides of the wall. He bemoaned the loss of their fearless leader Li Ming, and heard many of his friends crying out for Ming's watchful eye to guard over their surviving comrades before they were silenced.

Eventually, a dark night fell as quickly as his comrades had. The camp echoed with drips of blood against stone and the chirp of crickets, an assault on the scribe's senses that kept him awake and writing against his will, almost as if he was possessed. He wondered if this was the way Li Ming felt, and why he was so tireless. Despite the exhaustion, he just couldn't bring himself to sleep. As it turns out, that was for the better, because he began to hear a repeated *tik-scrape, tik-scrape, tik-scrape*."

Goosebumps traveled across my arms, no baijiu needed. Night was beginning to fall in our world, too, and back then we had no cell phones. Wherever we were, we were just *there, alone*. Kids these days will never know the same flavor of isolation we did; that much is evident in their willingness to bring it upon themselves with their screen-lit jails. 

"At first," Xun continued, "he thought it was the sound of the branches in the wind, beating against the guard tower. But the noise grew closer, and it sounded too sharp to be a branch. It was almost like a cat's nails, tapping as it landed on a hard surface, then scratching briefly as it dug in to prepare for its next jump."

Xun paused briefly. At this point, we were entranced, and had unintentionally huddled close together across from him, listening as if to a lecture. You can take the students out of the campus, but not the campus out of the students, I guess.

"The next part of the scribe's account includes some ancient Chinese that is a bit difficult to translate. Please have patience with me if the adjectives sound a bit nonsense. It's hard to find a direct modern equivalent for these words." We all nodded eagerly for him to continue.

"Don't worry, Xun. I can help you translate," Wenjun piped up.

"All right. So, the scribe heard the noise getting closer and closer. Since he was chained to the wall, he couldn't stand up to reach the window to look outside, nor could he crawl around the corner to look through the doorway of the watchtower without waking up the Mongol guards from the noise of his chains. He just waited as the noise got louder, closer, and--" Xun paused, consulted with Wenjun for a moment.

"--and more *foreboding*. Something about this noise was creating a dread within him, twisting his stomach into knots and cramping his muscles. Soon, he wrote that the noise began to be accompanied by a deep rasping, something that almost sounded like a cross between a gasp and a burp, but with the rhythm of slow breath. That made it ten times worse. He held his own breath and waited, as the noise made it all the way into the watchtower, right onto the other side of the wall he was chained to. One of the Mongol guards woke up and let out a brief cry - only about a split second - before it was interrupted by a muffled cracking noise. It sounded almost like ...uh," Xun thought for a moment about his next words. "Like a walnut cracked under a handkerchief."

Wenjun, Xiaowei (our fourth and only female friend - you know what they say about "the goods being odd but the odds being good" for women in an engineering college), and I burst out laughing, dispelling the creeping uneasiness that had settled over our group as a result of Xun's tale. 

"Is that seriously what the scribe wrote with his precious ink and paper?" I asked between peals of laughter.

"Come on, man, I told you the ancient words are hard to translate!"

"Okay, okay, continue! I wanna play the counting game after you're done!" Xiaowei shouted. I'd almost forgotten we'd come out here for a night of drinking and celebrating the end of the semester.

Xun continued obediently, the stars in the sky echoed in his eyes as he looked at her. "So the thing making the noise edged around the watchtower, making more muffled cracking noises as it went. As it rounded the corner, the scribe stopped writing. Something in him told him to stay as quiet as possible. What he wrote, he wrote after the thing left, and we are fortunate to have this account thanks to his bravery.

The thing came into view. It was a human skeleton, crawling on all fours, with two cloudy moons for eyes. The *tik-scrape* came as its elbows and knees hit the ground and it dragged itself forward. It was not naked, though - it was wearing Commander Li Ming's uniform. When the scribe saw that, he gasped, attracting its attention. The skeleton dragged itself towards him, painting calligraphy with its bones in the pools of blood on the watchtower floor. The scribe began to cry, assured of his horrible end. His neck would be snapped like the Mongols surrounding him.

'Chen?' rasped the skeleton.

At that moment, the scribe knew this had to be Li Ming.

'Li Ming? What has happened to you?'

'I promised I would always protect my troops. I'll never give up on my watch. You can count on me.'

The scribe was at a loss for words. He watched as Skeleton Li Ming dug into one of the corpses by its side and yanked out an arm bone, sharpening one of its ends on the stone floor. More scraping. More red seas on the floor parted, but rushing back to fill in the gap. The scribe watched with a mix of horror and gratitude as the Skeleton Li Ming approached his chains and picked their locks with the sharpened bone, freeing him.

'I won't let history forget you. I will write about you. Thank you, Commander. I don't know how to repay you.'

'Get back safely and deliver your story, so that reinforcements can come. I can't kill all of the invaders by sunrise, and my countrymen need help.'

'Yes, Commander.'

The scribe gathered his materials and carefully wrapped them in his shirt, which he placed into a Mongol's pack. He stole the clothes from a Mongol corpse and made his way down the mountain untroubled, bringing this story to the local townsfolk, who were able to alert the army to send reinforcements to the Great Wall. While nobody believed the scribe about the skeleton and figured it must have been a hallucination resulting from lack of food and water, and a sympathetic Mongol must have really freed him, they let him publish the story as he had written it. And no one could explain, once the reinforcements were sent, what had broken the necks of the Mongols in that watchtower. There wasn't a single mark on the outside of their bodies, but their heads hung limply on their shoulders, facing the wrong way."

Xiaowei's nails were digging into my arm, and Wenjun was slack-jawed.

"Xun, what the *fuck*, dude?" I said, zipping up my hoodie and stuffing my arms into it. "Who knew you had this in you?"

Xun grinned. "We couldn't come camping without a good ghost story! You're always going on about how that's a tradition in America!"

"All right, fair. You got me. But now can we get to the drinking games? That was so scary and I just want to party with you guys one last time before I have to go back home."

The next few hours was a trial-by-fire masterclass in Chinese drinking culture. I wish I could recall what we played or what the games were called, but none of that left an impact on me the way Xun's story still does all these years later.

Eventually there came a point in the night when the burn of the alcohol calmed into embers, and we found ourselves exhausted, but content. We set up our sleeping bags by flashlight in the dark watchtower we had chosen to set up camp in, the breeze keeping the air inside from getting too stale. 

"I can't go to bed without brushing my teeth. Will someone come with me to the bathroom?" Xiaowei asked, just as we'd all gotten comfortable. Of course. Xun and Wenjun were already snoring away, or at least pretending to so they wouldn't have to get up.

"I'll go with you," I relented. "I guess I could use a real bathroom."

We exited the watchtower onto the wall, and walked down a few flights of steep stairs until we hit a flat portion of the wall that met a properly paved trail. Lined on both sides with dense foliage, the path was more than a little creepy. Xun's story seemed to have wormed its way into both of our heads, as we instinctively edged closer until we were walking practically arm-in-arm to the bathroom. Thankfully, it wasn't much further down the path.

The bathroom consisted of three adjoining wooden booths raised a few feet off the ground on a wooden platform, each marked with an LED light indicating whether they were vacant or not. One of the lights was green, one red, and one apparently not working.

"You go first," I insisted. Xiaowei took me up on the offer, stepping into the middle booth under the green light and shutting the door. I reached over to the booth that wasn't lit up and tried the handle - or at least, tried to. The knob was missing. I leaned down and shined my flashlight into the hole where it should have been, forgetting all manner of decency and privacy in my drunken state. Instead of finding a bathroom, I was shocked to see a man in some sort of police uniform, sitting on a folded metal chair. He was turned facing the wall of the booth away from me, but when my light shined on him, he slowly began to turn around. Something about the movement made me really uneasy and I jumped back and switched off my flashlight just as the door to the third booth opened up. The man who stepped out of that booth gave me a friendly smile before taking out his own flashlight and ambling down the path. I was so grateful to see another human being at that moment that I didn't even stop to ask him what he was doing out here. I just jumped in the booth and slammed the door closed. I waited till my rapid breathing leveled out, used the bathroom, and cracked the door open the tiniest bit to survey my surroundings before stepping back into the open. Xiaowei was waiting outside, water bottle and toothbrush in one hand and flashlight in the other, foot tapping impatiently.

The sight of her gave me the courage to step out. 

"Xiaowei, you have to see this," I whispered, pointing to the first booth. 

"What?"

"There's a man in that room, and it's not a bathroom. He's in a uniform and he's just *sitting there*," I whispered urgently. "I shined my flashlight in there to see if the booth was open and I saw him."

Xiaowei looked to the booth and back to me, nervously. "Okay, I'll look, but I don't want to use the flashlight. I'll just peer in. Watch my back," she whispered back. I nodded.

She walked straight up to the knobhole and put her eye to it, then immediately recoiled. She walked back to me and whispered, "What are you talking about? I can't see anything. There's a knob there!"

Bewildered, I went up to the knobhole myself, and sure enough, there was a glassy white knob where there'd previously been a viewing point. It had been crookedly stuffed into the wooden opening and wasn't a perfect fit, so I figured the guy had just placed it there to prevent further snooping. A part of me was grateful not to have to see him and endure that gut-wrenching anxiety again.

I shrugged, walked back to Xiaowei, and we made our way back to camp where we collapsed next to the others until the sun woke us up. 

"Ugh, that stone floor did me no favors," Xun complained, rubbing his head as he rose. "So lumpy."

The rest of us grunted in agreement, too young to be plagued by hangovers just yet, but still in discomfort from a lack of adequate sleep and bedding. We collected our trash and packed up our stuff, agreeing to skip the hike and pay the entrance fee to take the tourist path back home. While we did so, I told Xun and Wenjun about the man in the uniform I'd seen in the bathroom booth. Xiaowei shrugged, only agreeing to corroborate the part of the story where we'd seen the glassy white knob together. I didn't blame her for being skeptical of my side of the tale.

As I finished up my story and we started down the flights of stairs, we ran into the man I'd seen in the bathroom booth yesterday. 

"Good morning!" I greeted him in my best Mandarin. "Thank you for giving me your bathroom yesterday; I really had to go and the first booth was taken by a man in a uniform."

He stopped dead in his tracks, his smile inverting to a scowl and his face turning as red as my favorite yangmei. He began yelling at me and pointing, finally spitting in my face. My Mandarin was not nearly good enough to keep up with his regional accent or his speed of speech, but naturally my first thought was that I'd spoken the wrong words and offended him somehow. I wiped the spit out of my eyes and shouted "I'm sorry" after him as he literally ran away from our group, then turned to my friends to help me translate what he'd said.

Xun handed me a napkin, his hand trembling. I noticed Xiaowei and Wenjun staring at him with expressions of dread.

"What? Xun, what did he say?!" I cried, the pit in my stomach growing deeper.

Xiaowei collapsed to her haunches, downing an entire bottle of water. Wenjun wouldn't stop shaking his head.

Xun gulped. "He said...he said..." He trailed off, took a deep breath. "He said that that first booth is reserved for the Night Guard. He's the ghost of a watchman who used to work at the watchtower we just stayed in. And that you should never, ever look into that booth or talk about him or you'll curse yourself and everyone you tell the story to."

"Xun. You said Commander Li Ming's eyes were like two cloudy moons. That's exactly what the knob looked like. A glassy, white moon. I was looking him right in the eye." The realization was enough to make me vomit.

We all wondered how much worse our neck pain would be the following night, or if we'd even survive it.
