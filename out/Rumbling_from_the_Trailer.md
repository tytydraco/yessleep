Grandpa and I were sitting in the living room when we heard the noise.

Grandpa had just finished a breathing treatment, which was why we hadn't noticed it sooner.

He'd been prescribed two a day until the remains of his cough were gone, and he hated them. The little machine was too noisy, Grandpa said. The medicine tasted bad, Grandpa said. It was all a lot of fuss over nothing, but I saw the difference in his cough. Ever since the doctor had put him on the treatments, I had heard him cough maybe once or twice, but never with the volume he used to. He was practically back to his old self, and that was good. With summer already upon us, Grandpa had been making plans that would take us out of the house and into the nearby woods quite often.

This also made for a great incentive to take his medicine.

If he wanted to go out adventuring, then he needed to get his treatments finished.

Grandpa had just put the little mask back on the machine when we heard an all-mighty rumble from just outside the windows. I looked at Grandpa, wondering what it could be, but after hearing it a second time, Grandpa laughed and picked up his crossword. I had put my book down, wondering if we should be concerned about it, but Grandpa just waved it away.

"It's nothin'," he said, "Just a bear sleeping under the back porch."

"A bear?" I said, my fears not dampened in the least.

"They do that from time to time. It's probably a young bear who's away from his den for the first time and just looking for a spot to sleep for the night."

It was getting dark out there, the sun dipping below the trees as Grandpa and I wiled away our evening. I had been thinking I might go out and call Glimmer so we could meet up for a walk, but the presence of a bear made me think better of it. The bears around her aren't usually keen on people, and I had little doubt that if I went mess around by the porch, I'd invoke his ire.

Grandpa looked up, snorting at my look of trepidation, "It's not like it's a big deal. At least it's outside. Heck, I once drove almost seventy miles with a real beast in the back of my truck."

"The one in the front yard?" I asked, skeptically.

"No," he laughed, "the one I drove in Alaska."

I was already on my way to the kitchen to hook us a couple of beers. We probably couldn't go drinking on the porch, but we could enjoy them, and a Grandpa story, right here in the living room. I had opened them as I came back in, and we clinked bottles as I took a seat and settled in.

"Well, if you insist," he said, pretending to be put upon, "It all started on my first trip to Nome."

John's younger brother woke me up one morning to tell me that Wayne was calling for me. I had been driving truck for him for about a year and a half, and I was pretty happy with the job. I got to drive all over the place, see all kinds of things, the pay was good, and there was a little gas stop on the way to Taylor that served a pretty good lunch and had a cute waitress I had kinda fallen for. I was hoping that he was calling to send me in that direction, but as it turned out, he had bigger plans that day.

"Jack, I need you to go to Nome to make a very special delivery."

My ears perked up. I had never been to Nome. I knew it was a pretty big city, a place a young man might get into trouble if he wasn't careful, and I was excited to see a new place. We were still using the old transport trucks, and I knew that if it was a long haul I'd be driving one of the nicer ones. The long haul trucks were always the best maintained and usually had a working heater too.

"I'm in. What's the job, Wayne?"

"There's a fella in town that wants us to take a load of expensive furniture up there. It's really pretty stuff, handmade from local wood, and this guy in Nome is paying him top dollar for it. He's offering to pay us some of those top dollars if we get it there on the quick, like within forty-eight hours."

I whistled. Nome wasn't a short drive, and to get there before the marker, I would have to drive all night to do it. It was doable, I had done it before, but that was going to be a hell of a drive. We talked a bit about pay and after settling on a special rate for a special job, I got up and got ready to head out. I took my thermos, a radio I had from my army days, and dressed warm in case the heater didn't work. This was early spring and there was still snow on the ground, so I wanted to be warm if something unforeseen should pop up.

Turned out something unforeseen was waiting for me up the way.

Wayne had Tuhlulla ready for me by the time I got there. Tuhlulla was our best rig. It was the closest thing to a semi-truck that we had, and the back was big enough to carry all the furniture and then some. Wayne asked if I wanted Scrap, but I told him it would be a bad trip to take the dog on. Time was of the essence, and Scarp was likely to slow me down this time. I checked the back, pulled up into the cab, and told Wayne I would see him in a couple of days.

"Once you drop your load off, feel free to stop for a rest. Don't be stupid and try to cruise all the way home. You're only human."

I told him I would be careful, and one thermos of coffee later, I was on the road to Nome.

The roads, like I said, weren't really roads like you'd think. If I was on concrete, I was in a big city, a major town, or a military installation. Most of the time I was driving on dirt roads packed tight by many wheels. The going was only bad in a few places, and the truck was heavy enough that the ice didn't really slow me down much. Breaking was always a harrowing experience, but it was something I had gotten used to. Even when you weren't trying to stop on snow, the ground was stony, the dirt was flaky, and you were just as likely to slide off an embankment in summer as in winter.

The trip to Nome was pretty uneventful, though I did get lost once and had to find a workaround. Luckily, a sign popped up before I could get too turned around. I made it to Nome in just over forty-two hours, and it was one of the first real cities I had seen in a while. It wasn't as grand as it would become, but given that I hadn't seen a big city since driving through Atlanta to get to basic, I was certainly impressed. It took me another hour to find the fella's address, but I soon had his furniture unloaded, with some help from his sons, and was on my way again.

I should have stopped in Nome, but after looking at what the hotels wanted for a night, I decided to head back out and just sleep in the cab after I'd gotten down the road a piece.

Turned out that a piece was only about an hour out of town, and by then, my eyes were trying to snap shut like cheap window shades.

I pulled over to the side of the road, made sure everything was as secure as it could be, and stretched out across the seat to catch a little rest.

I had slept about six hours when something suddenly rattled the truck. I was pulled awake by a sudden jolt, and as the wheels settled, I wondered how much of that had been a dream and how much had been reality. I looked around the cab and realized I wasn't going to get any answers there.

Stepping out into the cold march air, I checked the truck for damage. The trailer was fine, the wheels were intact, and everything appeared to be ship shape. I checked the inside of the trailer and saw that the big blanket we had covered the furniture with was still there, but whatever had jounced the truck had knocked the flap loose that kept the back covered. I re-tied it and got back in the cab, now fully awake and ready to roll.

I had driven a while, heading for home, when something moved in the back of the trailer.

It wasn't much, just a little shift, but it made me wonder if the blanket was the only thing back there. I thought about pulling over to check on it but opted against it. I could feel the way the wind was hitting the side of the trailer, and I just knew that it would be colder than a witch's tit out there. I was hoping to make some miles before stopping again, and as we rolled along, it seemed like smooth sailing. I had a few more hours of easy driving to go, but eventually, my luck ran out.

I was navigating some tricky turns, the roads narrow and icy, when I took one of them a little too hard. I heard something slide in the back, and when it connected with the side of the trailer, it loosed an angry roar that sounded huge. I was so surprised by the noise I nearly ran off the road. I wondered if I had fallen asleep at the wheel when something slammed into the other side of the trailer. It hit the walls, bouncing like a pinball as I tried to keep the truck from tipping over.

Whatever it was, it was huge.

It took everything I had just to keep from sliding off the edge, and as it roared again, I thought I had a monster in the back of my truck. It was heavy enough to jouncy the trailer, but not quite heavy enough to tip it over. I could hear the angry sound of metal as it grated long claws over the side, and I expected to see holes at any minute. I was terrified to stop, thinking it might get into the cab if it knew I was there, and finally just slowed down some so it could escape if it wanted.

I felt a cold draft a moment later and wouldn't realize till I stopped afterward why.

The thing had torn a gash in the back cab about as wide as my hand, and the claws it had used to do it had missed me by inches.

At the time though, all I felt was a sudden rush of air followed by a huge jounce that felt like something had hit the back of the truck.

I looked in the mirror and saw the length of canvas that covered the back of the trailer flapping in the middle of the road, and the body of an absolutely massive grizzly bear barely visible beneath it.

The paws, however, were on full display, and they were the biggest I had ever seen.

I could feel it watching me as I drove away, and I didn't dare stop until I had put many, many miles between us.

I was fully awake then and would be for the next twelve hours.

I made the trip back in record time, and when Wayne asked me what had happened to the back of the trailer, I told him the story.

To my surprise, he laughed.

"You gotta watch where you stop around here, Jack. You'll get all kinds of stowaways if you park too close to the woods for too long. Don't worry, I won't take the repairs out of your pay this time."

I was always careful where I parked for the night after that, but that furry fella wasn't the only passenger I ever had.

As I sat listening to Grandpa's story, the snores of the bear made a fitting backdrop.

"Sounds like an unbearable situation," I said, and Grandpa rolled his eyes as he chuckled in spite of the corn.

"I guess you could say it was a grizzly experience. He was definitely the worst guest I had in the truck." Grandpa said, covering a yawn as he sat back in his chair.

That reminded me of something else.

"Hey, didn't you tell me once that you picked up Santa Claus? I could have sworn you said you did, but you never told me if it was in Georgia or Alas," but when I heard a second snoring join the first, I knew story time was over.

I threw one of the thick blankets over Grandpa and went upstairs to get ready for bed.

Grandpa snored happily in his easy chair as he dreamed of frozen roads, great bears, and times gone by.
