  

I’ve been called many things, conspiracy theorist, crazy and lunatic. But I have evidence for my claims even if the government tries to shut me up. To get you understanding my beliefs I believe in the basic stuff, fake moon landing, the microchips in the vaccines and the aliens hiding in our government, but my main belief and the one I can disprove now, you see I don’t think this reality is real.

I think everything is made up; I know it’s not true now but it’s much worse. I found something recently and honestly it changed me when I found out, it all started on one of my normal evidence gathering activities, I had my telescope pointing to the north at night in Minnesota.

The cold wind blew up my heavy jacket and I shivered like never before, according to the records of a friend I made in a reality denying group there would be some sort of UFO causing a discrepancy and revealing what true reality looked like for just a second. My friend would get an amazing view in Greenland but I had to settle for my old shack in middle of nowhere Minnesota, after minutes passed of looking where I was told previously, I sighed and sat down with my metal cup of coffee.

“Not tonight I guess” I muttered to myself, it was another night without my wife and kids to try and find truth, I pulled out my half-used pack of cigarettes and that’s when it happened, the sky lit up for just a second and I looked up, in the sky was a string of colored lights moving across the sky. I whipped out my phone and took some pictures before running over to my telescope and getting a closer look, the lights seemed odd and they were getting bigger and, oh gosh. Was it coming towards me? it was, and it was fast.

I dived to the ground into the snow and heard the sound of something big going right over me only to smash into my shack, the sound of wood crunching and snapping with debris landing in the snow next to me, it took me more than a minute to get up, at some point the snow started to make me feel numb and tired but my body always pushes limits.

I groaned getting back to my feet as I looked back to shack, it was completely destroyed by the UFO slamming into it, the UFO was partly in the ground but no smoke or light came from the big object. Being hardly able to process it I could only record on my phone and run to the thing to try and investigate the mess, the snow crunched under my feet louder then ever only being drowned out by my voice giving an immediate response.

“Holy smokes” what laid in front of me was a UFO, but not your average silver disk with a glass dome or something, this was different. Best I can describe it is it was rows or rotating rings from biggest to smallest, guessing by the odd posing all the rings rotated around something in the middle, it appeared to be made of some metal that lightly glowed red in the stars light with the texture of the insides of a geode. But worst of all were the bulging eyes nonsensically distributed around the thing, the eyes looked around in a panic and seemed to be crying with one bleeding from a piece of wooden debris.

I was disgusted, but more than anything I was curious, just like a toddler faced with a kitten. I reached out and rubbed a finger across the rough material, that was probably the worst mistake in my sad life. A strong jolt of pain went up my arm like a static shock but much worse, I looked down and saw something inside my arm that horrified me, it was like a thin worm about six inches long, it slowly wriggled up inside my hand, I threw off my jacket to quickly track the thing, and there it was slowly crawling up the length of my arm sending huge bursts of pain through my whole body. I clawed at my arm as much as I could to get the thing out but I couldn’t stop it, blood dripped from my arm because of the scratches and I decided I needed to see a doctor.

The cold night wasn’t kind to my freshly torn apart arm, or my jacket-less self, it felt like it took hours of running through the heavy snow until I reached my big truck, I slammed the door closed and tried grabbing my keys only to have them fall to the floor, I grunted and yelped in agony but finally the keys were in the ignition and I was speeding down the lonely road.

I suppose that was my second big mistake, in incredible pain I felt my truck slip on the ice at a turn, before I could react my car was barreling towards the tree filled ditch and I crashed, the last thing I remember is the feeling of that unholy worm slithering up my neck, it’s a feeling I’ll never forget in my life.

Windows shattered, my truck bent like tinfoil and I hit my head bad, just lucky I didn’t die without my seat-belt.

Next thing I knew I woke up in the hospital, the cheap blanket rubbed against my body and my tired eyes were hard to open, around me stood a nurse looking down at my arm that was wrapped in a cast, I felt the absolutely disgusting sensation of something wriggling inside my head. I couldn’t believe it, I was in an absolute panic flailing my arms around and knocking down the IV attached to me, my vision was all messed up, every color was saturated and every noise echoed, but I got my wish, didn’t I?

I saw through our reality and saw the truth, I saw a tall thing standing at the end of my hospital bed, it was made of colors I can’t describe with lanky arms that dragged to the floor, it had large needles poking through its torso, I can’t describe its head, it was shapes I can’t describe and bulging eyes with colors I can’t describe.

This HAD to be because of that worm, so I begged them to help me.

“Get it out! Remove it! please!” I fell to the ground scratching at my head to get that thing out “help me!” the door slammed open and I felt my arms get restrained by a strong man. But by heaven, I realized it, how did I not see it sooner? This was reality, I was just seeing it for the first time, were these people trying to “help me” real? It was the government, wasn’t it? just like when they attacked me Las Vegas, or like when they called me out in a public speech.

I felt my arms slip away and I desperately got up and ran, my legs were tired, maybe injured? But I didn’t care, the adrenaline pounded through my body letting my legs carry me far. Deformed, small creatures crawled on the walls and balls of flesh laid on the ground, is this what the government had been hiding. Soon I was out the front door but still running as fast as my legs would allow me down the cold street in the cloudy weather, creatures and disgusting monsters were all over the streets, a creature with tall legs walked with the clouds, meaty bleeding trees sprouted meat sacks that dropped what looked like normal skinless people.

I wanted so much to believe it was all fake, that since nobody else could see it, it was a hallucination. But something I saw in the hospital and on the street conformed it to me that it was real, that this was just the reality nobody saw.

In the hospital I stopped for a second, an old lady talked to her family with the same thing that stood over me next to her, then the thing reached forward and its hand reached into her chest, the thing was like a ghost reaching in but when its hand touched her, she flat-lined instantly. And again, running in the streets when I stopped, I looked around, it was the big city and people laid on the sidewalk asleep. again, the same creature reached his hand into his chest and people started freaking out, because he had died.

I couldn’t handle this! I knew it was true now, I didn’t know how to handle it. I looked around at everything, and at the thing slowly walking towards me, it was the shape of a man except tall and it looked like a black foam, for a second I stared at it, it couldn’t be walking towards me, could it? but it was, it called out in a deep, distorted voice.

“He knows!” the black foam man began to run, and I ran away from it. my legs wanted to collapse but I was worried if I stopped running, I would die, the thing was fast but my massive amount of adrenaline was faster. I turned down an alley as did the thing but it nearly tripped over a pile of bricks knocking them over, and everybody saw the bricks fall.

I pushed people away in the alley but the thing was getting closer and closer, I made another sharp turn but I knew I would get caught If I didn’t do something, to my luck there was an open door to a store or a restaurant freezer. I ran in and slammed the door trying to lock it and when I heard the click, I knew I was safe.

Everything was cold again; the light was dim and boxes of frozen food lined the shelves but best of all there were no creatures here. I rested my head against the metal wall and closed my eyes giving me time to ponder.

The door slowly opened and I opened my eyes, the black foam man slowly walked with its head twisted towards me, its footsteps echoed in the room as I gave up, the thing looked down at me, my back slammed into the metal when the thing grabbed me by my neck and lifted me up.

“you’ve found the truth that you were never meant to see, the UFO, the parasite that showed you the reality you share, there is only one solution” the deep voice spoke.

I wriggled around, the hand around my neck burned like acid, but I couldn’t scream, my voice wouldn’t let me. I felt its other hand get shoved against my stomach, I didn’t understand what was happening, all I knew is it hurt and possibly blood dripped against my feet, everything felt like burning and the thing pulled its hand back. I felt weak, I felt tired, and I gave up. I got thrown to the ground like an old toy.

The thing left the room leaving me alone, I was left to die for seeing the truth, honestly, I knew I would get killed for knowing the truth someday, but not for this truth. I lived for longer than I expected, long enough to write and post this, but I can feel myself slipping away.

Just remember this, if you hear a noise behind you, somethings there you just can’t see it, if something falls randomly, they are watching you, if you feel like you are being watched you are. You are never alone, no matter where you are, and they will kill you if you see them.
