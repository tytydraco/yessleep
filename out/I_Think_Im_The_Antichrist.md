Everyone had been talking about the news. Pastor Jude had come out and said it. He said he spoke to God, and God told him that right here, in our little town, the antichrist was among us. Everybody knew everybody in my town; which meant everyone was suspicious of everyone.

That was when kids started avoiding me. They stopped sitting next to me in Sunday School, or playing hopscotch with me after church. Even my own brother avoided me. He would only say what he normally told me. He was the favourite because mom and dad only wanted boys. He even said if he had a daughter he would damn her to hell. I didn't know why everyone ignored me. Well, everybody except for Micah. He was the only kid in town who didn't avoid me.

One day, in Sunday school, as our teacher was babbling on and on about something or other, I was mindlessly doodling in my book as Micah sat next to me.

"Claudia," He whispered, nudging my elbow. "Psst. Clauds, cut it out. Stop drawing that creepy stuff." I ignored him, until Elder Greene was stopped in front of me.

"Claudia," He said in a warning tone. I switched the pencil to my right hand, like I was always told to do. "No, no, not that. What's that you're drawing?"

"Oh, nothing much really, Elder Greene. I was just doodling."

"Is that so, Ms. Keller? Well, let's see what this is, then." He picked up my book, and I gasped along with the rest of my class. Did I really draw that?

As I stared at my drawing, the pointed devil horns and sharp red eyes staring back at me, I couldn't help but think one thought. *I am a really good artist.*

Micah scooched his seat away from me a bit.

"Ms. Keller, I'm afraid you can't join us if you draw satanic runes like this." Elder Greene said, just as Pastor Jude walked into our classroom.

"Now what's this, little Claudia?" He asked, placing his hands on my shoulders.

"Nothing, Pastor-"

"This one here has been drawing satanic imagery in her book, Pastor Jude. It's really quite concerning." Elder Greene interrupted.

"Elder, you mustn't interrupt Claudia like that. Come with me, dear." He took my wrist, and led me out of class. We sat down in the spare room, the one with no windows and a lock on the door. None of the other doors have locks on them.

"Was I really bad, father?" I asked.

"No, no, my Claudia." He placed his hand on my leg, and tightened his grip when I tried to move away. "But remember, demons go after those who are weak in faith, the ones who have fought the hardest battles."

"The demons go after those who have fought the hardest battles? Are they protecting them, father?"

"No, no, my Claudia. Demons do not protect. Angels protect. Demons are horrible creatures, they feed off those who cannot fight back."

"But how do I know who is a demon and who is an angel, father?" Pastor Jude brushed his fingers through my hair.

"Well, my Claudia, we-"

Just then, Micah knocked on the door.

"Claudia? Claudia? CLAUDIAAA-" He started before Pastor Jude reluctantly got up and opened the door. He was holding a small chocolate egg in his hands.

"Sunday school ended. They were giving out chocolate eggs and I saved you one. It got a little melty, though." He reached his hand out to me, offering the melted chocolate that had been nearly liquified in his sweaty little palms.

"No thanks." I said.

"Well." Micah said, licking the chocolate off his hands. "Ready to walk home? My ma said I can walk home all by myself as long as I go with you. We can go to the playground on the way!"

"Okay. I have to go now, father. Goodbye."

As I left to walk home with Micah, Pastor Jude grabbed my hand.

"Goodbye, my Claudia." He said, kissing my hand. I pulled it away and hurried to catch up with Micah.

As we walked to his house, we talked.

"Do you really think there's an antichrist in this town?" He asked. "What even is an antichrist, anyway?"

"It's someone who does the opposite of what God wants."

"Oh. Who is it, then?

"I don't know. Maybe it's me. That's why everyone's ignoring me."

"I don't think you're an antichrist. You're only nine."

"I'm a whole four months older than you. Plus, I'll be ten in a week. April 3rd."

Micah shrugged. Just then, we heard a dreaded sound. The sound of Steven Shepard's old pickup truck. Steven Shepard was the meanest teenager in town, who loved to pick on kids. Especially me and Micah.

"Ooh, look who it is!" He mocked, stepping out of his truck. "Wittle Micah with his wittle girlfriend!"

"Shut up, Steven." Micah said. Steven picked him up with one hand and threw him to the ground. He tried to get back up, but Steven stepped on his face with his big dirty boots.

"And what're you gonna do about it, little girl?" He asked, as Micah tried to fight him off. He kicked Micah square in the mouth, making one of his teeth fall out. Then, he pushed me to the ground. He sat on top of me and pulled a pocket knife out of his jeans as I flew my arms in the air.

"Stop it, stop it, stop it, STOP!" I screamed, a sudden volt of energy soaring through me. Suddenly Steven was flung back like a ragdoll. I didn't know what happened. I was just so angry.

"Aw. fuck, man." He said, trying to get up. "I- yo, what the fuck is this?" He took off dirt stained white tank top to reveal three big scratch marks on his back.

"The rumours are right!" He screamed. "You're the antichrist!" He ran away, and I helped Micah up as he wiped blood off his face.

"Woah." He said. "How'd you do that?"

That night, as I brushed my teeth, I stared into the mirror. 

*The rumours are right! You're the antichrist!*

Could it be true? Was that why Pastor Jude always paid more attention to me? Because he was scared of me? 

Just then, as I looked at my reflection, I noticed a figure standing just behind me. The lights were off, so I couldn't make it out, but I knew what it was. It towered over me, staring at me through it's gaunt, sunken eyes, it's pale and bony hands resting on my shoulder. I looked behind me. Nothing. I looked into the mirror and there it was. But I wasn't scared.

*Demons do not protect.* Echoed through my head, but I ignored it. 

It inched closer towards me, and reached it's hand out of the mirror for me to take. I reached back, but as soon as I touched it, there was a sudden jolt of energy, and it was gone. 

Even as I slept, I couldn't get the imagery out of my mind. I had seen hell, and I wasn't afraid. Who really knew the difference between angels and demons, anyway? Where was the line between them? Pastor Jude didn't know. Elder Greene didn't know. Nobody knew. But I knew one thing for sure.

I was the antichrist. 

The next morning, I woke up in the back of my parent's car. My younger brother sat next to me, but he didn't look at me. 

"Where are we going, mom?" I asked.

"To church, sweetheart." 

"Church? But it's Monday." 

"I know. We have something else for you in store today." 

As we left the car, I noticed all the other townspeople staring at us. Some pulled their children away from me, others pointed and whispered to each other. I saw Micah, racing towards us on his bike.

"Claudia! Claudia! What are you guys doing!" I tried to turn to talk to him, but my parents pulled me away and carried me into church.

"The Keller family!" Pastor Jude said in a calm voice as we walked into the church. "I'm glad you got my message so quickly, Mr. Keller. Now my Claudia, will you come with me?" 

I took his hand, even though I didn't want to. He took me into the room with no windows and a lock on the door. 

"Father, am I the antichrist?" I asked as soon as we were alone.

"I-I don't know how to answer that, my Claudia." He said. "I always told you those weak in faith would be the first preyed upon by demons. You must have faith in the Heavenly Father, my Claudia. I'm afraid  you must be in this room by yourself for some time. Solitude is when we are best connected to God." 

"Please no, father. I'm afraid of this room, I don't want to be alone!" 

"You must be alone, my Claudia. I'm sorry." He said, and kissed me on the cheek. 

As he removed the door handles so I couldn't leave, I pounded on the door. I sobbed as the lights all dimmed, leaving me in total darkness. I tried to pray to the heavenly father to let me out.

*I am the antichrist.* I thought. If I really was the antichrist, why would He listen to my prayers? 

Hours must've passed. I had no idea how long I really was in there, I had no way to tell the time. I was so afraid and lost. Why was everyone scared of me? Why did I have to be born the antichrist? I didn't do anything. 

Suddenly, I heard voices outside of the room. Pastor Jude's. 

"This child is the antichrist! She will be the end of our town, the country, the world even! Do we just sit back and take it? It is in God's will to do anything to protect his children, and I say this child is only going to harm you! I say we kill the child, in the name of God!" He said, and I heard cheers and applause. 

"How?" A voice asked. Elder Greene's. 

"She's locked in a room, currently. If we burn the church down, she'll be trapped inside, and we'll be rid of the horrible sins that have been burdened upon this town!" Pastor Jude said, and I heard more cheers. "Well, what are we waiting for? Grab your torches, your pitchforks, whatever. Just be rid of the child." 

I wasn't sad any longer. I was filled with rage. They wanted to kill me? As the smell of smoke filled the air, I only got angrier. Then, I saw it.

The thing from the mirror. The demon with gaunt, pale skin, with sunken eyes and bony fingers. But this time it was right in front of me. I knew what he wanted me to do. In a fit of rage, I screamed, and the demon stood behind me. I reached my hand out, and the door blew off the handles. I didn't care if it made me demonic. I was too mad. I walked through the flaming building, and I wasn't hurt. But then I heard a familiar voice. Micah.

I rushed to the closest window, and saw him on his bike on the sidewalk across from the church

"Claudia! Claudia, come here! I'll help you!" He started pedaling across the street, when Pastor Jude appeared in front of him.

"Go, boy. Leave." He said.

"NO!" Micah yelled. "I have to help Claudia!" He tried to push past Pastor Jude, but he picked Micah up with one hand. With what looked like no effort, he threw him into the street. I tried to warn Micah from the truck that was coming his way, but I was too late. It ran over him, splattering Pastor Jude with blood. 

"Micah!" I yelled, which got Pastor Jude's attention.

"You! How did you get out?" He said, and started to run towards the church. I ran down the burning hallway as I heard his footsteps beside me. He chased me up the stairs of the bell chapel, the only part of the church that wasn't in flames. We finally met, face to face, his once clean and pressed suit dirty and bloodstained. 

"It's over now, demon child. Accept your fate." He said as the flames climbed up the stairs. He drew out a knife and approached me, when both of us snapped our heads around. There was a noise. 

Suddenly, I saw the demon who had been following me around. His head was bowed down to a figure beside him. I looked up, and saw the same horns and eyes as in my picture. The Angel of Death himself. Satan.

Pastor Jude looked scared. "Y-your satanic majesty! T-this child, she is the antichrist! You must take her away and punish her."

The devil scoffed. "I am aware of who Claudia Keller is. I sent my best demon out to protect her."

"P-protect? Demons do not protect."

He laughed a booming, loud laugh. "You really think? Demons protect those who need protection from evil. Angels don't do shit. They just sit in the sky all day and play their harps." The demon beside him wheezed, what I assumed was a laugh. "But you're right about there being the antichrist in this town. I've come to punish them."

"Really?" Pastor Jude said. "So you'll take her away?" He pointed to me.

Satan grabbed him by his white collar. "You really think, after everything I've told you, that Claudia Keller is the antichrist? You mortals really are stupid." 

"S-so... Claudia isn't the antichrist?"

"Of course she isn't the antichrist. She never was. You are." He said and snapped his fingers. The demon beside him grabbed Pastor Jude and opened what looked like a portal in the ground. They both fell through it, and I heard Pastor Jude's screams all the way around.

"Well." Satan said. "Now I can go tell God that's taken care of." He looked to me. "Now, my Claudia. I made a promise to God."

"Wait, you talk to him?" I asked.

Satan shrugged. "You mortals have a funny way of spinning things. We are more coworkers than anything. Well. I promised I would protect those who were mistreated by his children. These townspeople, they will never understand you. Things will only get worse. If you want to join me, my Claudia, you are welcome to. I have a special job for you, in my kingdom. What do you say?"

He stretched his hand out for me to take, and I thought about it. The people of this town thought I was the antichrist. They killed my best friend. They locked me in rooms with no windows and a lock on the door. But, what this the right choice? If I chose to be with the demon, wouldn't that only be proving their points?

But as I took Satan's mighty, giant hand in mine, I knew I had made the right choice. I was going home.
