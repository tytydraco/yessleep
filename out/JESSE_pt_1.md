This is the transcript of a recorded interview between Rick Beckett and someone who I will call ‘John’ for my own safety.

FILE-001

John: Welcome, Rick. My name is \[//EXPUNGED DATA//\].

Rick: Hi.

John: Why the long face?

Rick is silent for a second before replying.

Rick: I have many reasons, all which are valid.

John: I believe you are talking about your family?

Rick: How many times do I need to fucking tell you, I didn’t do anything!

John: I understand what you believe, Rick. But the facts stand: Your family is dead and you are alive. And you have yet to provide any other possible explanation, not even in court.

Rick: I can’t tell anyone what happened. What *really* happened. They would move me from this hellhole to somewhere even worse.

John: And why do you think that, Rick? What happened?

Rick is completely silent.

John: Rick?

He still doesn’t talk.

John: Rick, please talk to me.

Rick: It was Jesse.

John: Who is Jesse? What did Jesse do?

Rick: Jesse killed my family.

John: Who is Jesse?

Rick: (takes a deep breath) I… I met her last month. On vacation, at the beach. I saw her on the pier, sitting by herself on a bench. And she was beautiful. So goddamn *beautiful*. I walked over and sat next to her. We began talking, and she said we should hang out sometime. I agreed, and got her number.

John: Rick, I’m sorry to interrupt, but you were a married man a month ago.

Rick: So? You didn’t see her. She was the most stunning woman I had ever seen, and that I ever will see. Got any other questions, or can I continue?

John: Please.

Rick: A week later, after we had gone back to our respective homes, she called me about potentially meeting up soon. I said it would be great, and she said that she would come over to Chicago and meet me.

John: Did she?

Rick: The next day. We met at a fancy restaurant.

John: Did you tell her you were married?

Rick: I… I did, at the end of the dinner. But she wasn’t sad. Or mad. There was something else on her face as she left that restaurant. I didn’t know what it was then, but I do now. It was malice. Pure hatred.

John is silent.

Rick: I never told her where I lived. I never even mentioned a neighborhood. But as I drove, I kept seeing the same car ahead of me. Not behind me. Ahead, turning a corner just as I came to that light.

John: Was it her?

There is no response, but it can be inferred that Rick nods at this point.

Rick: Eventually, she got too far ahead. I couldn’t see her anymore. I began to panic. That look on her beautiful face… I wish I would have done something different. Not told her, maybe. Maybe then my family would still be happy. Alive.

There is a long silence.

John: What happened?

Rick: You know what happened.

John: Can you… tell me in your own words?

Rick: When I got home, there was blood *everywhere*. Neighbors had heard screaming and called the police. So there I was, sitting in a house full of dead, mutilated people, *my own family*, for fucking Christ’s sake, and I was arrested. You were there for the rest of it.

John: Why didn’t you say any of this?

Rick: Well, as soon as I could, I called Jesse. Some random lady picked up. She said that this number is hers and has been for quite a long time.

John: Could you have gotten the number wrong?

Rick: No. I knew it. I *still* know it.

John: If what you are saying is true, there has been a murderer on the loose for over a month, without us even knowing about it.

Rick: I swear to you, I’m not lying. I’m not!

John: I know… that you *think* you are telling the truth, Rick.

Rick: You piece of shit, you don’t believe me!

John: That’s not what I’m saying. Please, calm down.

There is a large crash, before the recording device cuts out.

&#x200B;

A few days after the date of this recording, John was reported missing, as well as Rick. Neither of them have been found as of now. They are both presumed dead.

I found this recording in the depths of a government archive, along with many other files, all titled JESSE with a file name. I tried to save as many as I could before I left, but I must have missed quite a few.

I will try to share as many of these files as possible before I am found out.

Sincerely,

Julius Klein
