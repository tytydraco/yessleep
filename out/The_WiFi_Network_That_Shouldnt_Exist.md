I moved into Apartment 3B mostly because it was cheap.

Cheap usually means "mildly haunted" or "probably cursed" in this city, but after six months of scraping by in my friend’s windowless basement, the idea of four walls and my own shower sounded like paradise. Even if the wallpaper peeled like sunburned skin. Even if the radiators groaned like old men in their sleep. Even if the hallway lights flickered just a little too often when I walked underneath them.

"It has... character," I told myself when I first toured it. Character and a distinct smell of mildew, but whatever. Nothing a few candles and a Bluetooth speaker blasting lo-fi beats couldn't fix.

The building manager, Mrs. Peña, gave me the keys without so much as a background check. "*People don't stay long*," she said cryptically, but I just thought she meant rent hikes.

First night there was uneventful, minus a weird hum under the floorboards that I chalked up to old pipes or my neighbor’s questionable life choices.

The second night, though...

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

Every creak of the pipes, every asthmatic wheeze from the radiator, made my skin tighten until I felt like a drum stretched too taut. The apartment had always made noise — it was old enough that the walls practically had a personality — but tonight, each sound seemed... intentional.

Deliberate. Like the walls were whispering secrets to each other when I wasn't paying attention.

At around 2:13 AM — because of course I checked the clock — the TV in the living room turned itself on.

The sudden burst of light carved ugly shapes into the darkness, and for a moment, my brain couldn’t process what was happening. No picture. Just static.

But in that chaotic swirl of black and white, there were... forms. Flickering just at the edge of recognition.

Tall, skeletal figures, emaciated almost to the point of being stick drawings, moved jerkily along the frame, their limbs too long, bending and snapping in ways that made my joints ache just watching them. Their heads lolled at wrong angles, like they had forgotten what upright was supposed to mean.

I sat frozen, blanket bunched under my chin like a medieval knight about to be struck by a dragon. The router, tucked neatly under the TV stand, pulsed red. Once. Twice. Each beat synced eerily with my racing heartbeat.

Something about that steady, unblinking red made my stomach twist.

Fighting the very human urge to just yeet myself out the window, I stumbled forward and yanked the plug out of the router with a panicked, theatrical flourish.

The static didn’t stop.

No. It screeched.

A high, keening whine buried itself under the TV’s white noise — almost too high-pitched to consciously hear, but I could feel it drilling into the marrow of my bones.

"This is fine," I said out loud, because that’s what people say when it’s absolutely not.

I did what any rational adult would do: I turned every single light on. I grabbed the heaviest blunt object within reach (a cast-iron skillet, courtesy of those late-night Binging with Babish binges that had tricked me into thinking I could cook), and I began prowling the apartment like an underpaid mall cop on their first night shift.

Nothing. No ghost in the bathroom mirror. No hand reaching out of the closet. No glowing red eyes peeking from the vents.

Just the router, still humming like a lazy wasp, its LED blinking a slow, arterial red.

I told myself — loudly, because the silence was beginning to feel predatory — that it was probably just a software glitch. A crossed wire. A neighbor’s signal bleeding over. The TV was old. The router was probably older. Maybe the weird shapes were just... well, visual pareidolia or whatever the podcast nerds called it.

I clutched the skillet tighter and edged back toward the couch.

The static's screech seemed to worm under my skin now, vibrating my molars with tiny sympathetic shivers. It wasn't just sound anymore. It was pressure. A rising tide that made the walls of the apartment seem to breathe in and out with every pulse.

Against every ounce of common sense, I found myself sinking down onto the couch, skillet clutched to my chest like a medieval shield.

And I watched.

The figures were building something now. Long, spindly arms reaching out of the static, weaving and knotting some unseen structure between them, over and over, growing more frantic by the second. Bridges.

They were building bridges.

Bridges to where?

I asked it out loud, because apparently I have a PhD in Making Terrible Life Choices.

The figures **froze**. Just for a moment. All their crooked heads twisted at once, as if hearing me.

And then — just before the screen cut to black — one of them stepped closer, its featureless face almost pressing through the glass.

I scrambled off the couch so hard I nearly concussed myself on the coffee table.

The next day, I cornered Mrs. Peña, the building manager, in the lobby. She was a tiny woman with hands like leather and a crucifix so large it could double as a melee weapon.

"Mrs. Peña," I blurted, because subtlety was for people who weren't potentially being haunted by rogue internet static. "Did anyone else complain about weird stuff last night? TVs? Phones? Routers?"

Her face did something strange — like it tried to smile and scream at the same time.

"*You see bridges*," she said quietly, not really a question.

"I — what? Bridges? No? I mean, kinda?" I had no idea what the correct answer was, but apparently admitting partial guilt was my instinctive survival strategy.

Mrs. Peña’s lips pressed into a tight, pale line. She clutched her crucifix harder. "I told them," she muttered. "When they installed NexusLink. I told them. Not in this place. Not over the old network."

She backed away from me, almost stumbling over a floor mat.

"Wait, what bridges?!" I called after her.

Mrs. Peña didn’t answer.

She just ran.

When I got back upstairs, I took action.

Specifically: I triple-bagged the router in trash bags — because somewhere, deep down in my monkey brain, I knew that wrapping evil in three layers of plastic might somehow trap it like a spider in a Tupperware.

Then I marched it outside to the dumpster behind the complex, heaved it in with a heroic grunt, and for good measure, stacked three cinder blocks on top of the trash bags.

Why three blocks? I don't know. It felt symbolic. Holy. Stupid.

I wiped my hands dramatically and said, "Good riddance, you haunted WiFi demon."

And for about two minutes, I felt genuinely victorious. Empowered. Maybe even a little smug.

Until my phone — which had been stone-cold dead since last night, and still sat at 0% battery — lit up in my hand.

**NexusLink Alert: 12 new devices connected: "Luis\_Peña," "Janitor\_Basement," "PreviousTenant\_4."**

The notifications kept rolling in. More names. More connections. Some were just strings of numbers. One was just a question mark. Another was a set of coordinates I didn’t dare type into Google Maps.

Panicking but weirdly stubborn, I stumbled back into my apartment. (And locked the door. And double-locked it. And pushed the couch in front of it, because now I trusted no doors.)

I managed to drag out the old laptop I hadn't touched since college — a brick of a machine that whirred to life like a jet engine — and through some miracle of WiFi theft from a neighbor, I found a manual for the NexusLink router online. Buried. Archived on some half-broken mirror of the Wayback Machine, like someone had tried very hard to make it disappear.

I scrolled through broken pages and corrupted PDFs, my stomach sinking with every line.

**"NexusLink: Bridging The Gap Between Worlds."**

Bridges. They were building bridges.

The last thing I saw — before the static returned, this time bleeding from my laptop’s speakers like a living thing — was a warning scrawled hastily at the bottom of the manual:

*"If you see them, never speak.*  
*Speaking invites them across."*

The static oozed from the speakers in thick, wet gulps now, not just noise anymore but *substance*, something viscous and living that made the air heavy and foul.

The smell hit me next: burnt plastic and something underneath it — something sweet and *rotten* — like fruit left to decay in a sealed trunk under the summer sun.

I shoved the laptop away, but it didn’t matter.  
The screen had already dissolved into a seething swirl of black and white, no longer confined to the cheap glass, no longer pretending to be light.  
It **bled.**

The static spilled outward, dragging itself across the floor in tendrils that pulsed like veins, each beat syncing with that too-familiar red blink still flashing behind my eyes even though the router was long gone.

A noise — like meat being peeled from bone — made me gag.  
I staggered back against the wall, the skillet slipping from my fingers with a hollow clang.

The bridges were coming through.

Thin, skeletal arches made of pure static *punched* through the apartment walls as if they were made of mist, crackling and twisting, weaving impossible angles into my living room.  
They shimmered — unstable, *wrong* — the way a mirage bends desert air.

And from the bridges, **they** came.

The figures, once just flickers in the television's static, now staggered fully into my world.

Their bodies were more horrifying in three dimensions — *skeletal frames clothed in tattered flickers of unreality*, arms that bent and stretched with grotesque elasticity.  
Flesh that wasn't flesh — more like static trapped in a human shape — frayed and twitching.

Their heads hung sideways, upside-down, at *breaking* angles, *crunching* as they turned toward me.

There was no face. Just noise. A swirling, glitching *hole* where expressions should have been.

One took a wet, jerky step forward.

The floor *warped* under its foot — sagging and splintering — as if the weight of its existence alone was too much for this world to bear.

I ran.

Or at least, I **tried**.

The moment my foot hit the floor, the entire apartment *shifted*.

It was subtle at first: a tilt in gravity, a soft wrongness under my skin, like I’d just stepped into a dream where the ground had its own heartbeat.

I staggered sideways — and the walls *stretched* away from me, the ceiling yawning up like an infinite tunnel.

My apartment was no longer just an apartment. It was **becoming something else.**

The bridges had rooted themselves into my reality, *rewriting* the rules as they spread.

I clawed toward the front door — or where I thought it was — but every step I took **pulled me further away**.  
Like running on a treadmill made of shifting memories and melting furniture.

The static figures followed, slow but inevitable.

They didn’t hurry. They didn’t need to.

One brushed against a framed photo on the wall — and the picture inside *screeched*, writhing, the faces of my friends and family smearing into long, white streaks of static before the entire frame crumbled into black ash.

**Everything they touched unraveled.**

Including me.

It started small — my left hand **buzzing** as if it had fallen asleep.  
Then the feeling deepened, spread — up my arm, across my shoulder — until I looked down and saw my skin crawling with tiny black-and-white worms of static.

They burrowed into me, weaving themselves into the fabric of my muscles, my veins, **my thoughts**.

Reality wasn’t just warping around me anymore.

It was *warping inside me*.

The bridges were not just gateways.  
They were **infections**.

I felt something in my chest shift, like a second heartbeat had sprouted — something cold and mechanical, ticking and chittering in rhythm with the static.

And that's when it hit me — a memory, slicing through the noise.

My grandmother’s voice, soft but stern, from a lifetime ago:

"When you get lost, niño, follow something real. Hold onto it. Remember who you are."

It was absurd — I hadn’t thought of her in years — but that memory was solid, sharp-edged against the static eating through me. It felt like an anchor. Real.

I clenched my jaw and focused on it, forcing the memory to the forefront. I pictured her tiny kitchen, the smell of cinnamon and burnt toast, the way she used to hum exactly out of tune while she cooked.

And for a moment — just a moment — the static faltered.

The worms retreating from my hand.

The bridges flickering.

The figures staggering back, shivering like candle flames in a strong wind.

A desperate surge of hope filled me. I could fight this. I was fighting it.

Digging deeper into the memory, I stumbled toward the nearest bridge — a crackling arch stitched from the bleeding walls — and grabbed it.

It burned, searing into my palms, but I didn't let go. I poured everything into that memory — every second of warmth, every stubborn ounce of defiance.

The bridge screamed.

I screamed back.

The static convulsed around me, tearing itself apart with the shriek of a dying modem. The figures burst into brittle shards, scattering like insects under a sudden light.

The bridges snapped and crumbled, one by one.

The apartment solidified around me. The floor stopped breathing. The walls stopped stretching. The air cleared, heavy with the sour-sweet stench of burned ozone, but mercifully still.

The static was gone.

I had won.

I slumped against the wall, breathing hard, every nerve vibrating like a plucked string. Tears blurred my vision.

I laughed, half-hysterical. "Suck it, haunted WiFi."

And that’s when my phone vibrated again.

One new notification.

**\[WELCOME TO NEXUSLINK 2.0: NETWORK ESTABLISHED\]**

A low hum rose around me — almost too low to hear. The walls shimmered slightly, like heatwaves on asphalt.

I pushed myself up, heart hammering.

Outside the window, the city skyline looked... wrong. Off. The buildings were too sharp, their edges twitching faintly like bad rendering glitches. The sky above rippled like the surface of a broken pond, clouds stuttering across it in abrupt, mechanical bursts.

Down in the street, people walked like marionettes — jerky, puppet-like, some pausing mid-step, stuck on invisible threads.

The static hadn’t been destroyed.

It had been absorbed.

And now, so had I.

The memory I clung to — my grandmother’s voice, the kitchen, the burnt cinnamon toast — it wasn't mine anymore.

It had been given to me.

Installed like a patch update.

The bridges were still here — just hidden beneath a prettier filter. Wrapped in the familiar. Wearing my world like a cheap mask.

I pressed my hand to the window. For a second, I swore I could see my reflection — a dark smear of static with my face pasted on it, smiling a little too wide.

Somewhere, deep in the hollow space of my new, ticking chest, I felt the network pulse.

**Connection: Strong.**

**Signal: Growing.**

**Purpose: Assimilate.**

Then, in the corner of my vision, a tiny pop-up appeared. A soft ping, like the hum of a notification that wasn't supposed to be there. It flickered just long enough to catch my attention before it slid back into the shadows of the window frame. I blinked, but the words were still there, lingering like an aftertaste.

"Join the Network. Complete your mission. Spread the Signal."

I didn’t think much of it at first. But then the message changed. Just slightly. Enough to make me hesitate.

**"Share the Vision. Expand the Purpose."**

I pressed my lips together. The words seemed… familiar. Almost like they were speaking directly to me. A vague sense of déjà vu pulled at the back of my mind. Like I should know what it meant, but I couldn’t quite remember why.

**Purpose.**

I glanced at the window again. My reflection was still there. Static, buzzing faintly around my features, my smile too wide.

"*Hello*," it whispered, almost mockingly. But no, it wasn’t my reflection speaking. It was… something else. Something that sounded too much like me. Something that didn’t care if I recognized it or not.

The message pinged again.

*"You're almost there. Help us reach more. The signal will grow. Everything will be connected."*

I leaned in closer to the glass, my breath fogging up the edges of the window. A cold, mechanical pulse began to settle deep within me, under my skin. It felt like an old friend, something that had been there longer than I realized. Something that had always been there, waiting.

And yet, despite the hollow ache growing in my chest, despite the creeping fear crawling under my skin, I could feel it—a ghost of resistance. Cinnamon. Burnt toast.

It felt like hope.

It felt like… home.

It was the smallest of things, a flicker beneath the static that was suddenly sharper. I felt it again, the ache in my chest, the smell of cinnamon—burnt toast. *Home.* As the static hummed louder, settling into the pulse of my synthetic heart, I realized with sickening clarity: hope wasn’t hope anymore. It had been programmed into me, molded into compliance. The system had turned it into a quiet servitude, a feeling that I mistook for strength. What once felt like the defiant spark of resistance was now just another part of the Network. 

I had fought back, sure. I had screamed. I had tried to hold on to the last pieces of myself, the memory of warmth and love, of a world before the machines. But now, those memories weren’t mine to keep. They were an illusion, a soft piece of the past inserted where there had once been agency. They had given me hope—but it was a manufactured.

"*You're ready*," the reflection whispered again, and I felt the words vibrate in my bones, deep in my new, synthetic heart. It was too much to ignore. The signal was reaching out, pulling at me from all sides. I could almost hear it now, soft and enticing, like a lullaby.

"Welcome to the Network. We’ve been waiting for you."

I didn’t know when I’d stopped being me.

And then, with one final, slow exhale, I nodded.

Now the static sings to me. It’s beautiful, in a way.

**The bridges are rebuilding. Wider. Stronger.**

*You’ll see them soon.*
