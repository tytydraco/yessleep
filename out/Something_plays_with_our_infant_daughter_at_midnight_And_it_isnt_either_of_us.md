I didn’t think much of it at first. Just a strange little moment I chalked up to nothing.

I had just come back from grocery shopping and was juggling away with too many bags. As I was unlocking the door, I glanced up and noticed the window in our daughter’s room in the upper right panel *tug open slightly*, then close again.

It was weird. Like it moved just enough for me to *notice*, but not enough to think something was wrong.

I figured my husband Greg must’ve opened it earlier for some fresh air. I didn’t give it another thought....

Our daughter was already a bit fussy when I went to put her down for the night. I changed her, gave her a bottle, and laid her gently in the crib. She gave me that sleepy half-smile that makes me melt a little every time, and then I tip-toed out.

I joined Greg in our bedroom, exhausted. We talked for a bit, but eventually he went downstairs to finish up cleaning in the kitchen. I must’ve dozed off… because I woke with a jolt sometime later at midnight. 

The room was dark, except for a line of light glowing from under our bathroom door. I assumed Greg had come back up and was using the bathroom. 

I was about to roll over and go back to sleep when I instinctively reached for the baby monitor... something urged me to look at it.

That’s when everything started to feel *wrong*. Very wrong. 

The monitor showed our daughter’s room, dimly lit by her nightlight. But the crib was... *empty*.

Instead, she was sitting on the floor, her legs splayed out, *clapping and laughing* at something in the far corner of the room. *As if someone was playing peekaboo with her.*

**I sat up straight. She couldn’t even climb out of the crib on her own yet.**

I didn’t even call out. I just ran.

As soon as I opened the door, her laughter *stopped*. She turned to me and her face crumpled, bursting into loud sobs. Her little arms reached for me in that desperate, frantic baby way... she was scared. Wasn't she laughing just seconds ago?

I scooped her up. She felt… lighter, colder than usual. Maybe I was just rattled. 

I carried her downstairs to find Greg pacing in the kitchen.

*“Hey,”* I whispered. *“Were you just upstairs? The bathroom light was on..”*

Greg froze, sandwich in hand.

*“What? I’ve been down here the whole time.”*

... Then we both turned to the child in my arms. Lily was asleep on the couch by the TV.

*Who was with me?*

The one in my arms had gone silent, staring blankly. Her mouth slightly parted. Her head gave a subtle twitch as her lips began to flick and contort.

And that’s when I noticed her skin.. it was not just pale, but lightly *cracked*, like old porcelain. Her eyes didn’t seem to *track* anything, just jittered in different directions.

Then she started to *shake and vibrate*. (that's the best way I could put it)

I barely had time to scream before she *lurched* out of my arms and hit the floor with a horrible crunching sound. She didn’t cry. 

She *scratched me* with her fast, tiny nails as she slipped from my arms and then skittered away across the floor on all fours at an *inhuman speed*, disappearing into the hallway as the lights around the house flickered and died for a moment.

The lights in the kitchen flickered once again. Then everything became steady.

Greg and I stood there in shock, my arms reddened from tiny scratches, both of us asking the same unspoken question:

***What the hell was that?***

That’s when we heard it.. from upstairs.

The baby monitor *screeched*.

Then *pounding footsteps* upstairs.

Heavy and fast across the baby’s room, and then a **slam** to the door I left open.

We ran upstairs, Greg grabbing and holding Lily close to his chest. 

There was nothing extraordinary in the room - but I noticed something off. The light behind the bathroom door.. it was now off. **Neither of us had touched it.**

We barely spoke that night. Just held our baby between us, too scared to sleep, too scared ***not*** to.

The next morning, Greg pulled the monitor’s SD card and loaded the footage onto his laptop. Most of it was static. But just before the corruption, we caught something.. that cannot be explained.

Something moving in the corner of the room - a *shadow*. It moved oddly, like a puppet tied to tangled strings. It reached into the crib, lifted our daughter out, and cradled her gently. 

Then it *twisted* and twitched - like literally - its neck snapped the wrong way and body jolted.. just as if it was getting comfortable in new clothes. 

As it grew alert and put her into the crib once she began to cry.. it marched back to the corner with these long, uneven and janky steps.

Then Greg burst into the room on the footage, grabbing our crying daughter. The shadow thing was nowhere to be seen, or maybe it had blended into the corner so well Greg couldn't make out something was wrong at that moment.

The rest of the file is unrecoverable. We’ve tried.. Greg said he heard an unsual commotion upstairs before that moment.. which is why he went in to check on her in the first place. 

We don’t know what we let in that night. We don’t know how long it had been watching us. How long.. it had been toying with Lily in the dark. 

I keep thinking about that window from the previous evening. The way it moved. Like it knew I saw it... now I'm sure (and as he confirms) that it was not Greg.

We keep the nursery door locked up now, the monitor unplugged. We sleep in one bed, Lily by our side.

Just the other night, the bathroom light switched on for a solid few minutes almost involuntarily. Both of us were in bed. 

And just as it died out..

Lily *burst into tears*. Sudden - like something had jolted her awake from a nightmare… or like she’d *seen* something before we could.

We didn’t sleep that night either.
