It was 11:30 PM when I ordered an Uber car. I watched on the app as the car approached, and I could see that it was a black SUV. I thought to myself that this was a fancy Uber for someone like me.

I got in the car and greeted the driver. I told him my address from him, and we started to drive. We drove through the brightly lit streets of downtown, and I started to relax.

Then we turned onto a dark road that I didn't recognize. I looked at my phone, and it said we were still on course, but something felt off. The driver didn't seem to be following the usual route, and he was driving faster than he should be.

I tried to speak to him, but he didn't respond. I started to feel anxious, and I could feel my heart beating faster. I looked out the window, and I couldn't see any streetlights or buildings. It was just darkness.

Suddenly, the car came to a stop. The driver turned around and looked at me. He had a creepy smile on his face that made me feel uncomfortable. I tried to open the door, but it was locked. Panic set in, and I started to scream.

The driver just kept smiling at me. He reached over and grabbed my arm. Then, he leaned in close to my ear and whispered, "Screaming will get you nowhere."

I was terrified. I tried to kick him, but he grabbed my other arm too. I felt trapped. I closed my eyes and prayed for it to be over.

After what felt like hours, the car started moving again. I opened my eyes to see that we were on a deserted road in the middle of nowhere. I looked at my phone, and it said we were still heading towards my address, but it didn't feel like we were.

The driver pulled into a dark alley and turned off the engine. He turned around and looked at me again. This time, he wasn't smiling. He had a look of anger on his face from him. I knew I had to do something to get out of this situation.

I unlocked the door and tried to open it, but the driver had locked it from his side of him. I started to scream for help, but there was no one around to hear me. I thought this was the end for me.

Then, the driver's phone range. He answered it and started to talk in a language I didn't understand. He seemed agitated, and he kept glancing at me. After a few minutes, he hung up and started the car again.

He drove me to my address, and I jumped out of the car as soon as he stopped. I ran into my house and locked the door behind me. I was shaking and crying, but I was safe.

I reported the incident to Uber, and they promised to investigate. I don't know what happened to the driver, but I hope he was caught and punished for what he did to me.

Since then, I've been scared to take an Uber at night. I know that not all drivers are like that, but I can't help but feel anxious every time I get in a car. I hope that one day, I'll be able to overcome my fear and trust again, but for now, I'll stick to walking or taking a taxi.
