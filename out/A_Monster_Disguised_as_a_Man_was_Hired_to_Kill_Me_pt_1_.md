To start things off, my name is Carlo Cremonesi. I was born 42 years ago on a date that doesn’t really matter anymore. My parents were abusive scumbags that had no business having me and my three siblings. They were both alcoholics with a gambling addiction, and they  fucked us children up nice and good, to the point where true success for us was just a dream. My oldest sibling, my sister Theresa, killed herself at thirteen. My brother Leonard overdosed on heroin at twenty-seven. Then there’s me. I’ll get to me in a bit. My youngest sibling, my brother Rocco, was ripped in half in front of me just four days ago. I saw everything spill out of his fucking body. Heart, brains, kidneys. All of it. I’ve seen my fair share of death. Hell, I’ve caused quite a bit of it. But to see your own brother’s entrails staining your feet is a whole different ball game. 

Now you’re reading this and wondering “Where the fuck is this going?”, and I sure as shit don’t blame you. Well, as I said, my name is Carlo Cremonesi, and I was in the mafia, La Cosa Nostra. This Thing of Ours. Now why did I do this shit, why did I join this organization that’s way past its prime? Well,  throughout my life, my drunken, gambling parents took loans from some wise guys in the neighborhood. They couldn’t pay back these fellas. So when the time came, a big man in a beautiful suit came by and took some shit from us. My parents were scared shitless, crying and begging on their on knees to be spared a beating. To see those two worthless bastards, the same ones that beat and tortured me and my siblings everyday, shitting themselves and reduced to begging was incredibly satisfying. That’s how I got a taste for the life. 

By the time I was sixteen, I was running little favors and scores for the guys in my neighborhood, earning some nice money doing so. By twenty nine, I was a made man, trusted to do incredibly important hits. I took down a mob boss - not that anyone really knew, that’s a big no-no for us. I’ve taken out a retired cop that had a big mouth, other fellas, and even my own goddamned brother in law. In a drunken stupor, one of my fellow members let it slip to his wife, and by some channel of fucked up gossip, it slipped back to my wife. She was distraught, and as she hit me and called me every curse word in the book, I realized how bad I fucked up, how much I had become like my parents. I basically neglected and mentally tortured my wife for whatever riches I thought I had. I couldn’t fully see the error of my ways until she hung herself with our unborn child in the womb. That was it for me. 

For seven more years I continued earning, but it became meaningless. The money and success I thought I had meant nothing. It wasn’t success, it was a goddamned nightmare:coked out whores couldn’t give me what I had with my wife, the money came in hand over fist but left twice as fast. 

The last hit I did was five months ago. Some prick owed the boss himself almost half a million, and started ducking him. I had next to no money, and I was desperate, so I took care of it but in the sloppiest way imaginable. Some bystander saw me and called the cops. I was questioned but folded under no pressure. I was tired and ashamed and wanted a clean slate and atonement, so I decided to cooperate. Yeah, I’m a fucking rat. I started talking to the feds, who agreed to put me in witness protection if I wore a wire. That lasted about two weeks before someone fingered that I was wearing a wire. 

I made sure to clean out my house and safe-houses, and started boarding with some whores I knew. But each one ended up diming me out for some smack and a few c-notes. Three weeks ago, I ran out of New York altogether and up to Connecticut to live with my brother in his apartment. The apartment was tiny, but no one knew I had siblings. I told everyone they were all dead. That’s when the bullshit started. 

Four days ago, I  woke up at around three in the morning to knocking on my brother’s door. I got my gun ready, and my brother looked through the peephole. He said no one was there, and it was probably some kids messing around. I fucking wished it was. The door fucking swung open and off of its hatches, knocking my brother back. Standing in the door frame was a man in a clean, three piece, navy-blue suit. He had to be about six feet tall, slim, and his hair was neat and slicked back, kinda like how guys did it back in the fifties. His skin was like a white guy’s, but a little too pale, and his eyes were dark brown. The fucker stood there in the door frame with an ear to ear grin, fixing his tie. 

“Sorry I had to kick the door down. Your brother took too long to answer”. He took a handkerchief out of his blazer breast pocket and wiped some dust off of his shoes. He places the handkerchief back in and began to chuckle. I was on the floor, shaking so hard I almost dropped my gun. 

The guy looked at my gun and started to laugh even harder, saying “That’s not gonna be of any use, Carlo”. I ignored him and shot six bullets into his chest. The bullet holes closed in front of me. 

“I told you it wouldn’t work, Carlo. You almost fucked up my suit. I don’t like that”. The man, creature, or whatever fuck he was, reached behind his back and pulled out a machete, picked my brother up against the wall, and cut my brother from his groin to the top of his head, then threw the entrails at my feet. Blood splattered along the walls of the apartment. 

“You’re a rat, Carlo, and the boss doesn’t like rats. I’m an exterminator of sorts, but with special tools that you ain’t ever seen before!” His normal human-sounding laugh became a deep, raspy laugh. His suit slouched off like a snake’s skin and burned up into nothing. His flesh began to tear, revealing his sickly, gray skin underneath, and his mouth opened up to my height as he chomped down right in front of me. I didn’t wait any longer, I picked up my gun and wallet and ran out through the fire escape. My heart was thumping so fucking fast that it felt like it was gonna come out of my goddamned throat. 

As I stumbled onto the sidewalk outside, the monster jumped down from the fire escape and landed on my back, digging something sharp into me. It felt like a hot iron was being pressed into my skin, and it reminded me of when my parents used to put out cigarette butts onto me. The monster flipped me over onto the pavement, and I stared into its dark, black eyes, then passed the fuck out. 

I woke up about a day later. The doc says I was found on the sidewalk and needed an emergency blood transfusion due to severe blood loss. The doc explained everything to me but I couldn’t listen. I just kept hearing and seeing that fucking thing. 

As the doc walked away, a nurse with a surgical mask on came into my room with some pills. As I reached for them, the nurse pulled down her mask, and revealed the face of the monster. The sickly, gray skin with the beady black eyes and sharp toothed smile. I froze in fear as the monster leaned over and whispered in a raspy voice: “This is just the beginning!” The monster put its surgical mask back on, and returned to looking human. 

I started screaming and passed out again, only to wake up a day later during the middle of the night with three silhouettes surrounding me.
