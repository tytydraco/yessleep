***I*** trudge the last few steps through the familiar gravel, the uneven path poked through my black flats. Ma’ always told me I could sleep on my own two feet—until now, I didn’t think that was possible. Maybe it’ll be different tonight. Though since my Mother's funeral, I haven't had a good night's rest, and now after Dad’s I don’t think I ever will. 

The barking coming from the house brings a spring to my step as Grandma struggles to balance the dishes in her arms, not willing to accept any help until she complains. Pongo—the fluffy black border collie rushes out of the house jumping with its full strength, almost knocking me off my feet. Border collies may not be too big, but they're still strong, and Pongo made that clear by knocking me on my butt. At least he seems pleased. I roll my eyes at him clutching my stomach trying to catch my breath.

“Come on, Abbie dear, help me set the table.” Grandma Cecil sighs into the dry air numbly strolling into the small kitchen. I don't mention that we ate only an hour ago. I stumble through the front entrance hurrying to take off my muddy shoes. Pongo follows me close behind.

The bay window facing the sunset fills the dining room with a warm light as I throw my itchy black wool coat onto the older-than-dirt coat rack, rushing to my Grandmother’s side. I withdraw the casserole dishes from her unsteady hands and quickly dump them on the counter. Grandpa, hot on our trail—big clompy stomps creaking against the old wooden floor, giving him away.

Grandma was angry all morning about this. He felt he didn’t need to bother dressing appropriately. He was barely willing to wear black, but him having a conniption from Grandma’s morning wails; a few hours before the wake he finally gives in. Grandma wins *most* of the time. Thankfully.

But he still kept his work boots on no matter how Grandma pleaded. Grandpa Henry Finch was no pushover and has been a stubborn bastard the day he was spat out of his mother’s womb. From what Dad told me he was an awful child and a more awful man, and would mumble that a lot, especially after a fresh argument with the so-called bastard. He would call him a bastard a lot too. Ma’ didn’t like it when he talked about Grandpa like that, so he usually did it on his smoke breaks.

Placing our old family silverware across our dining room table Grandpa grabs a cigar from his “special” silver case. That’s what he’d croak when asked any way. I knew it was just a regular cigar case, nothing special. The smoke cloud permeates the room quickly, beginning to stink up the house.

“Put that out or open a window Henry!” Grandma croaks, not having enough  energy to glare at the man, instead aggressively throwing a serving of miscellaneous casserole slop onto his plate. 

“Girl, get the window.” Grandpa orders cracking his jaw sliding deeper into the chair. Numbly jumping from the kitchen table I hurry to lift the bay window facing the front porch, the sunset’s golden light covers the open field with a warmth it didn’t have a day ago. “Stop taking all that fresh air!” He barks at me with a couple snaps of his dry wrinkly fingers. 

I quickly glue myself to my seat, my plate already filled with a Frankenstein mix of casseroles. I cringe away from the so-called dinner. I can’t hide my puckering lips and scrunched up nose fast enough before Grandma takes notice. Wiping her mouth delicately, not daring to smear her classic red lip.

“Eat up Abbie Ray, you don’t want to waste our neighbors well wishes, do you dear?” As she asks this in her most debutante forced demure tone, I dig my nails into the palm of my hand, leaving crescent shaped marks. 

I dig up a humorously large forkful of goo, chomping through it quickly, as my Grandma eagle eyes me the whole time. I smile, forcing myself to swallow it all down in one gulp. It had the texture of mashed potatoes and tasted as if the gravy came straight from an old sock. Looking away to try and grab Grandpa’s attention, as he reads today’s newspaper; I drop my plate on my lap letting Pongo guzzle it all down. It only takes a few seconds before he’s lapping up a clean plate. 

Jumping up from my seat I wash my plate at the large kitchen sink, Grandma doesn’t notice my new invigorated eating habits. I rush to flee the kitchen hopping to the stairs, hoping to be ignored. 

“Water the garden before bed.” Grandma quips before I’m up the second step. 

“Yes, ma’am.” I sigh, loud enough only for Pongo and me to hear. Not wanting to have my ears pinched for dawdling I grab my bright yellow raincoat–not as warm as my black jacket, but I don’t want to get the wool wet. The drizzling rain splattering the window sill, the gray clouds speeding over the horizon across the soon to be night sky told me everything I needed to know. Quickly weed, no watering necessary. Get it done and as a prize I can fall into bed. Maybe fall asleep for once. “Stay inside Pongo! I don’t want to bathe you all because you want to play in the mud.” I stuff my feet into my rain boots; Pongo sits at the backdoor’s exit with a weak cry. “Good boy.” I pat his head as he wiggles in place, happy in an instant.

The rain is still a whimper of a drizzle, making the cold chill from this afternoon feel ten times worse tonight. The damp wind flies through my bones and my teeth start chattering. Shivering off the back porch and onto the cobble path I plop myself onto the damp dirt. Starting the mindless work of weeding the kale first.

Looking up from the muddy weeds after feeling my fingers grow numb from the cold my mind and eyes wander. I glance up and see the small, cute scarecrow hanging above the personal garden—center of the well-worn cobble path, lit up by an old lamppost. We had very few lampposts around the farm, Grandpa never wanted to refill the oil even when he was young. Father and Grandpa argued over this topic *a lot*; Grandpa was too proud to forfeit and Dad was too level headed to continue the fight. Though, it's *way* less scary than the scarecrow out in the barren wheat field. It’s the size of an adult man, looked like it came straight from a horror flick with its button eyes and worn out burlap sack of a head.

*The tearing of flesh grows louder as the crows pick at Dad’s body right on the edge of our property line. The sounds; the gurgling squelches—the sliding of meat going down their throats was my Father’s dirge.* 

*His body was lying against their tree, but I couldn’t get myself to turn around and verify it for myself. Deep down I knew though, their initials were carved there, sadly the fresh blood was accompanying it.* 

*Instead of turning around and seeing it for myself, I mindlessly stare at the scarecrow and I swear it felt like it was looking back at me.*

I knock my dirty fist straight to my skull, and then again—*thud*, trying to get myself to stop that train of thought. My eyes beeline to the dirt, not wanting to see *it* anymore. Dad wouldn’t want me to remember that. He wouldn’t want me to remember *him* like that. 

The light from the back porch showcases the shadow of my grandfather gruffly grabbing the phone from the wall—right beside the small window framing the gray drab kitchenette. His shadow grows more expressive, aggressive; his voice so loud it could shake the whole house down. When Grandpa got angry everyone in a ten foot radius would know, that’s for sure.

“You have the gall to call after the wake Sonny? Hah,” Grandpa’s shadow’s arms waves wildly, a sudden wet cough hacks out of his mouth mid-tirade. “If you think you can claim any right on this land, you're kidding yourself.” Murmurs on the other side of the call is the only thing that stops Grandpa from continuing his tirade. “What do you mean by that, boy? David wouldn’t have done that without discussing it with me first…” He spits out through the shadows, and I flinch automatically at his tone.

The horn blared off before the silver metallic semi was visibly driving up across our fog filled property. It's shining, shimmering, and encased in a metallic chrome that is noticeable even in the dark. Seemingly awful to drive when brights are on, but maybe that wasn’t a big issue. 

Shaking myself from the mud that coated my rainboots and quickly throwing my gloves to the wet dirt I ran, following the cobble path towards the driveway.

The old rusted lamp post flickers before I stop right under its beam of light, not just a step behind my anxious grandparents. Grandma clung to Grandpa before he shrugs her away, slowly trudging towards the parked semi, the smoke clouds coming off it like it had its own personal fog attached.  As I run, quickly running out of breath, but still stampeding full ahead—I accidently, like that clumsy nitwit I am, slam myself into the flickering lamp post center of the gravel entrance way.

The light flickers and its pitch black, time stops.

Creak. The door bursts open and a tall lean shadow of a person emerges. The lamppost flickers, the beam of light comes to life illuminating us, making me feel more exposed than ever. The shiny metallic machine of a semi settles, rumbling like a hungry stomach—smog coming off of it, as the person manning it slinks towards us. Long shadowy limbs with a cap attached steps closer, just on edge of the flickering beam of light. 

Grandma’s bony hands glue themselves to my shoulders, her damp sweat seeping into my overalls made my skin crawl. Looking up, her thin eyebrows were scrunched up together, wrinkling her forehead. Something she usually admonished me for doing. Smacking Grandpa’s shoulder, who looked like a dying fish and cringing under her incessant little swats, steps forward to address the man of a shadow.

“What you doin’ here? I’ve signed off on nothing and you don't have any right trespassing on my property! What are you anyways, one of those *All and Sundry’s* minions?” Grandpa bellows, limping across the damp cobble path towards the trespasser. 

“We are only entering this property because we have the signatures on a contract giving us permission.” The lanky silhouette leaning against the metallic semi shrugs.  “We have every right to place this new equipment and feed here. The contract was signed off by the two co-owners Mr. David and Wayne Finch. They signed off on only using *All and Sundry* equipment and feed for their farms. Then in turn gaining all the free services by adding our label to your products, of course.”  

From some unknown cue, out from the semi, the equipment was being placed onto our property-brand new and worth more than our entire livestock. A new tractor for the fields and an extra to boot! They all had the same metallic shimmer the semi was coated in; a signature look of *Sundry and Co*. The brand new, sterile equipment seemed too *shiny* for something that's supposed to create new life. As if they belonged in a hospital rather than a ranch.	

Trying to evade Grandma Cecil's hands I peer into the darkness, the moving figures disperse out of the semi one by one. Squinting my eyes, barely able to make out anything under the flickering lamp posts; my only form of direct light, only able to see silhouettes emerging from the large vehicle. Dispersing with the tractor and loads of feed they were worker ants united as one big hive.

Grandpa scuttled forward, lagging behind the delivery man with yellow eyes, yelling he didn’t sign off on this. It's a mistake signed off by young fools. But…Dad wouldn’t do that. Uncle Wayne maybe, but definitely not Dad. Grandpa knew it too, the farm was *everything* to my Father. He wouldn’t give our rights away…he couldn’t have. 

“Don’t you dare put that shit in our farmhouse. I didn’t sign off on that! Neither did my son, you filthy liar! Piece of shits…” Grandpa’s bravado may be loud, but he certainly won't leave the comforting spotlight that the old light post offers. The silhouette shape of a man cackles, finally taking his glowing eyes off his apparently very important clipboard. They flash amber, so golden bright I swear they were glowing.

Grandpa flinches under the corporate agent’s direct gaze.

With little care the agent of *All and Sundry* offers my Grandfather that very clipboard. Grandpa grabs it from his hands with extra force, looking like he wanted to commit violence onto the man. Grandma tightens her hold on my shoulder, as if ready to grind me like pepper. 

“This…this can’t be.” Grandpa stutters, for once in his life he is not capable of arguing.

“Your sons signed off, sir.” Amber eyes shrugs again, seeming as unbothered as he did when arriving on our property. Scuffing his feet in the dirt he grabs a whistle from his purple jumpsuit, the shade of color barely perceptible in this thick dark smog.

With the blaring high pitched sound of the whistle going off, they all turn back to head to the large metallic semi. As if like worker ants in an easy monotonous tempo, they file in line. Most of the feed was left in large buckets on our front entrance porch, but at least the brand new equipment was put near the farmhouse.

Grandpa would surely make me put everything away by myself. The ringing from the phone residing in the kitchen goes off, the blaring sound fills the thick empty silence. Grandpa’s pale face grows ghostly white under the direct light, turning his head slowly. Blinking back his obvious horror he fumbles towards the house, readying himself. Grandma shudders, not able to hold up her facade that was barely holding up in the first place. 

“Go to sleep dear, it's past your bedtime.” Grandma Cecil commands clenching my shoulders before pushing me towards the front porch. Leaving only herself to say goodbye to the slowly dispersing crew of *All and Sundry*.

Pongo’s barking hasn’t stopped since the semi’s arrival. Now dispersing, glancing over my shoulder, I can see the amber eyed man slink towards my grandmother. As if to tell her a secret he leans in forward covering his mouth. She indulges, leaning toward him. Amber eyes flashing, and with a blurred focus they looked like they resembled slits similar to cat eyes. 

Gulping down my own scream I ran inside the house, almost missing a step up the porch. Skinning my knee I ignore the pain and throw the front door open, not caring that Grandpa’s on the phone. Wincing at my Grandpa’s tone, an argument was brewing on the other line.

“What do you mean you signed our rights away?!” Grandpa’s pure rage was soaked in every word he bellowed at the phone. “You have no right boy!”

Knowing Grandpa’s tone instinctually by now I decided to sneak across the kitchen, not wanting to get caught in his crosshairs. Pongo’s by my side, catching on he instinctively shadows me. Pongo doesn’t make a sound, and I pat him on the head as I sneak up the creaky wooden stairs. With each creek it is drowned out by Grandpa’s fury.

“You only have a quarter of the rights on this farm. How in the hell did the bank sign off on this insolent whelp?” Grandpa shrewdly snarks, holding in a cackle. “What do you mean your brother gave you the other percentage?!” Grandpa’s shriek grew distant as I creeped up to the second floor finally able to barrel myself into my room. 

Kicking my door shut just as Pongo enters I jump into my bed. Using my own feet to shove my muddy work boots off. Pongo jumps up, like he always does every night, spinning over and over making his own nest of blankets in the center of my bed. Sighing, I quickly throw on my heavier red and black plaid pajamas—knowing full well this cold fog won’t leave the property until the end of the week, at least. Grandma said so earlier this morning before the wake. She just knows things like that. 

I snuggle into my thick comforter and my sage green pillow. I turn in my bed and see their wedding photo framed on my nightstand. Her wedding dress and veil resembled a fairy tail’s dream, and Dad looked proud, confident with her draped on his arm. They both looked so happy. His deep dark eye circles are gone and he doesn’t have those crows lines he was known for. 

From what I know they were freshly twenty. They met in high school, Dad and Ma’ always recounted how they fell for each other quickly. They were each other's *best* friends before love was even on their mind, or so they told me. There wasn’t anything that they didn’t enjoy doing together, if separated one would wish the other was there, Grandma and Grandpa always complained, calling them ‘cheesy.’ 

Like what they had was some act, phony as a cheap local commercial. Shaking my head I straighten myself up. Pushing the covers away, Pongo huffs at my sudden movement. Taking one more glance at my parents, I push my thoughts buzzing to the back of my head as I open my bedroom’s door. 

Grandpa's booming voice could be heard from the kitchen, making me wince before bravely taking a step outside my room. Pongo runs into my leg full force, his cold wet nose sniffles indignantly at my abrupt stop. I peer down from the banister, Grandpa burns the wood under his feet as he paces back and forth, still angry as a rabid raccoon, screaming at the phone connected to the wall.

Looking to my left there my parents bedroom was untouched since both their recent deaths. I don’t think anyone’s entered their room since Dad got the rifle from his gun cabinet last Sunday. He went out to the edge of the field…and…well. I shake my head from continuing that thought. 

“Wayne, do you have any idea on what you’ve just done?” The bellowing echoing off the walls sounded desperate even in my ears. Grandpa rarely showed weakness, and it made me pause. “How dare you bring your brother into this! I certainly  didn’t see you at the wake!”

Ignoring Grandpa's growing tirade I continue to sneak down the hallway. With each bare step on the cold wooden floor I could feel sweat trail down my neck. Pongo barks at me, jumping, slamming into me and I clash against the banister. Wobbling as I quickly regain my steps, faltering to my parents room. Opening it quickly I pause, staring, gapping at its lack of change. A red and black flannel shirt was thrown on the bed as if to tidy later and my Mother’s jewelry box was left open—the ballerina frozen still; running out of turns. There were some necklaces and rings strewn across the vanity as if to choose from later. Dad never put her jewelry away. I should have guessed.

Throwing the palms of my hands flat on my face I grind them against my eye sockets, stopping myself from crying. I can’t cry. I need to stay strong for Grandma and Grandpa. Steeling myself and throwing my head back I can vacantly see the light on in the kitchen from the open door. I quickly grab my Dad’s flannel shirt and nab my Mother’s wedding ring. 

Pongo growls, upset at being ignored for so long. I shush him quickly, kneeling down before him, I gently caress his soft mussel.

“Good boy, now stay quiet. We don’t want Grandpa and Grandma upset, now do we?” I inquire softly, and Pongo's head turns as if confused at the question. Pongo growls again, but instead of sticking close to my side he is by the window facing our wheat field. At the edge of our property a dense forest took over, a lot of hunters like to go deer hunting there.

Dad took me a few times during deer season, he was a really good shot. Grandpa rarely gave out compliments but he would always hand one out to Dad when hunting season came. Dad didn’t love it, at least that’s what I thought, he  seemed to much prefer the art of butchering the animal itself. He said he would start teaching me next year.

Squinting my eyes and holding my breath I see a flicker of movement in the wheat field, as if something came running out of it. Blinking rapidly I open the window quickly leaning out trying to see from a better angle.

“You flush our family’s name—our ancestors’ livelihood down the drain for a quick check!” Grandpa’s shouts echo out into the night air. I quickly shut the window and scurry out of my parents room. With what I wanted in hand I quietly slink back to my room. I cringe, flinching at Grandpa growing louder with each sly step I take.

“Didn’t even come to the wake to face your family, not man enough to face your consequences, huh?” Grandpa didn’t give Uncle Wayne much time to respond, going off again. “Your brother isn’t here now is he? Can’t take the blame for you like always!”

I slam the door of my room, Pongo’ tail just barely making it, closing my eyes tight trying to block out Grandpa's words. Pongo’s cold wet nose rests on my back, oddly comforting. Thankfully my room is isolated enough where it's only muffled shouting that was audible now. I throw myself onto my bed and Pongo is not a second behind, curling at my back, muzzle laying on his big paws.

Shoving my Dad’s flannel shirt under my pillow and gently placing my Mom’s ring on my nightstand I bury myself under my fleece blankets. I cling to Pongo’s soft fur and close my eyes tight as I try to forget about the wake, about Dad…and Mom. I just want the memories of their coffins sinking in the dirt to disappear. 

Breathe in and out. I try to fall asleep, trying to remember anything *else* but the past few days. Just *try* to imagine...**try**; they're in their bedroom sleeping not a few feet away from me, right…there. Closing my eyes tight, I pretend; just for one night. 

Just for tonight.
