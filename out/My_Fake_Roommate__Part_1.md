Hello, Nosleep. I understand that scary stories are frequently posted here, so I thought I'd share an experience that has kept me awake deep into the night every night for nearly two years now. Even now, I don't understand how it happened or whether what I experienced actually occurred. I'm awake now actually, thinking about it again, I guess that's why I'm writing here.

Essentially I made someone up. I fabricated the existence of a nonexistent person for my own personal gain. I don't know how ethical that is but believe me when I say I was desperate then. Making up a fake person was the least of the wrongful things I did. I can't say I regret it all just yet.

Two years ago, my life was going nowhere. Fresh outta college with a degree in arts and not a damn thing to show for it. I am applying for jobs, but my degree seems to have just led me to jack shit, no matter where I applied. I tried writing a book, gave up on it after my first draft was rejected by multiple publishers. I had no money, no job, nothing, all I had to my name was this disgusting old apartment that, low and behold, I was to be evicted from if I didn't pay the damn rent.

I can't exactly remember how it started or when, or even what caused the thought to pop into my head. I decided I needed to make cash quickly, so I started selling stuff on the streets. Anything I could sell, I sold, and what I didn't I kept trying till I did for a little over a week before the day my rent was due. I'll let you take a guess at whether or not I made rent. I didn't.

The landlord came knocking on my door that very morning. I had fallen asleep on my couch after drinking the night before. I might've used some of the money I earned for rent to pay for those drinks. Anyway, I woke up, rolled off the couch, and nearly cracked my head open on the concrete floor. I probably would have continued lying there if the landlord hadn't started vigorously banging on the door. I half expected him to break it down with how he was knocking. I stumbled to my feet, nearly tripping on some underwear on the floor that had been wedged under the leg of the couch. By the time I got to the door, I had nearly tripped over almost every random object I'd left on the floor. I opened the door and was instantly greeted by my salty landlord, Mr.Wall.

"Boy, you look like shit. Have you been drinking?" He asked glaring at me intensely.

I might've also forgotten he had a very strict no alcohol policy.

"No," I said with a goofy smile on my face, still slightly inebriated. As if my stumbling around like an idiot wasn't a telltale sign.

"I know drunk son and I also know fucking stupid. Look at me right now and tell me you're not either." He said as he grabbed hold of my lower jaw forcing me to look at him.

"I'm not drunk," I said in possibly the drunkest way possible. "And I ain't stupid either."

"Okay so you're not stupid, just a fuckin moron. Where's my rent, slick mic?" He asked, his expression turning from anger to very visible disappointment.

I didn't know how to answer him. Every possible excuse I could think of played out in a scenario in my mind that ended horribly, no matter what. That is until my drunk ass blurted out.

"My new roommate is gathering their share now. They'll be back later." I said, instantly regretting my lie, but just before I could correct myself, Mr. Wall's expression changed once more from disappointment to pure and valid confusion.
"Roommate? Why is this the first I'm hearing of this?" He started glaring at me intensely again.

"Uh, well, you see I was going to tell you. It kind of slipped my mind. They're a friend of mine who asked if they could crash with me for a bit." I didn't think in that moment about whether what I was doing was right, but I didn’t care. If this lie could potentially stop me from being evicted then I'd let my nose grow forever to make up for it. "I forgot to tell them exactly what day rent was due."

The moments that followed were ones of awkward silence. The sheer willpower Mr.Wall had to have to not start screaming at me in that moment must have been interdimensional. Instead of doing that or anything else I expected of him, he simply took in a deep breath, exhaling as much anger as he could muster.

"Okay. A friend correct?" He asked.

"Yessir," I responded.

"I'll drop off forms for them to sign later. In the meantime make sure they get that rent. Got it?" 

I nodded my head in an unsynchronized motion as my head began to hurt from the bright hallway lights. He nodded back and left me alone as I shut the door behind myself. Despite my aching head, I began to bang my head against the door as I rattled my brain around why I'd made up such an obvious lie. All I'm saying is that the conversation may have begun with me as the idiot, but in the end, I somehow managed to literally flip the script on its head. Who's the moron now Mr. Wall?

To make this lie somewhat believable after taking some pain meds for my head, I got to work on cleaning up the apartment and making it look as if two people were living in it. I then collected what cash I didn't spend on booze, and after selling stuff for an entire afternoon, I was finally able to pay my rent. Looking back now I honestly don't know why I was so insistent on staying. Like the place was a literal shithole, yet to me, it was my home.

Knocking on Wall's office door, he opened it with an odd grin on his face. Almost Jack Nicholson in nature, which kind of gave me the creeps.

"So where are they?" He asked as I handed him a sealed envelope with my rent inside.

"Where are who now?" I stupidly responded.

"You're roommate dumbass. Where are they?"

"Oh, they dropped off their share and took off. Probably to a club or something, they party pretty hard."

"Oh really. Well, here I've prepared the forms for them, make sure they sign all of it." He grinned again.

I genuinely couldn't tell if he was calling my bluff or not, but if he knew all along then the bastard should have said something. Maybe he was just humoring me while also taking some pleasure from it himself somehow. I don't know.

When I got up to my apartment, I unlocked the door and stepped inside. A cold breeze hit me instantly. I checked around the apartment and even the thermostat to see why it was cold. That's when I spotted the open window in my bathroom. The cold autumn wind came rushing in from it. I quickly closed it and stood next to my heater to warm up. Funny, I don't remember leaving that open but let's be honest drunk me probably needed to puke.

I sat down once again on the couch and took out the forms Wall had given me. After thinking about it for a hard long time. I eventually signed on the signature line the name my roommate. Berry McCaulkiner.

Call me what you like but I've never laughed so hard writing a name in my life. If I was gonna let this lie run it's course then I might as well have some fun with it. I wrote his age as being close to mine, his height about 7'9, his weight 60 pounds. I essentially fabricated my own fucked up original character using those forms. All just so I could stay in that stupid apartment for at least another year. I know I'm going to hell, so don't remind me.

After having my fun I walked back to Walls office and slid the forms under the door. I would've knocked but I could hear strange noises coming from the other side of the door. I didn't feel like seeing Wall in a bathrob or something.

When I returned to my room I flopped onto the couch, turned on my TV and pretty much watched whatever was on while drinking the rest of the liquor I had. I felt I earned it for my successful bullshitting tactic. I think around three hours passed, TV was still on and I had completely fallen asleep drunk. 

That's when I heard it. A rustling sound coming from somewhere in my apartment. I remember my eyes going from shut to wide open in an instant, but I didn’t move. I laid there completely still and just listened. I'm not lying when I say I heard someone basically making themselves at home. The sound of bathroom shower being used, footsteps coming in and out of random rooms, my kitchen sounded like it was being raided, and it all culminated until eventually I heard the sound of the bathroom window opening. Slowly I could feel the cold breeze from the window. I sat up still drunk, looked around, but saw no one. The noises I heard, all just seemed like they were in my head. Everything in my apartment was normal that night, all except that window that was wide open again.

In those few moments, I've never felt more terrified in my life. Think about it, I mean really think about it. You hear noises in the middle of the night, especially ones like I heard, you'd be terrified too.

Anyway, I've got to get to work soon. I'll make another post some other time about my experience. Oh and feel free to ask questions, I mean it's not everyday you hear tell of someone fabricating a whole identity let alone admitting it.
