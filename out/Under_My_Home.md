We bought the place in 2019. It was our first home after having rented a place to live our entire marriage of 7 years up to that point. It didn’t cost much by today’s inflation standards, but it was a gamble for us since it was quite an old home with a series of add ons to its structure. 

I was told that that it had been a gas station, bait shop, and even grocery store at some point at the original concrete structured master bedroom and then added onto from there. It didn’t really matter to us as long as it would get us by a few years. 

That was until recently when the living room started sinking. I knew the footings were old-school and shallow in that area of the house, but I was extremely frustrated to see the the rate at which it was happening. 

I should take the time to clarify that there was an old cistern that had been capped off a few feet away and outside of the house by the front door where the sinking was taking place. I didn’t think much of it as I had had taken a peak through a crack and noted that it was at least 10 ft deep. I planned to fill it in eventually with a load of gravel, I wish now that I’d looked deeper into the matter.

3 night ago my wife woke me to tell me that she was hearing music under the floor.. I assured her that was impossible and that it was likely one of the kids’ toys underneath a piece of furniture somewhere and rolled over. But, then I started to hear it and then I heard what sound like laughter following it. I’ll be honest, I was so tired that I opted to sleep it off. We joked about our crazy imaginations the next morning before we headed off to our jobs.

It was funny until it started again the next night at around 2 am.. my wife wasn’t hearing it, but it sounded like swing music from the 40’s or 50’s, or at least like you hear in the movies. It started getting louder, so I rolled out of bed, fired up the flashlight on my phone, and headed out the front door. 

When I got the cistern and looked through the crack, I could swear that I was seeing light down there. No sooner had I thought that when the brick cap over it crumbled apart and sent me descending rapidly to the bottom. I never knew how deep the water would be holding down there, but I was shocked when I hit the ground quite harshly with only about 6 inches of water to greet me. 

I suspected a mild fracture had taken place in my right leg, but that didn’t seem to matter as much as what I’d landed on in the water. You see, I scrambled for my flashlight to confirm that what I’d grabbed onto was what what I’d feared; half a human skeleton. I won’t lie: I let out a scream like a toddler that had just dropped their ice cream cone. 

It was at that point that I realized that both I had no reception on my phone to even try to call and tell me wife I was down here, and the music was much louder and seemed to be coming from behind the brick wall lining the cistern and under my house. Furthermore, there were a few cracks in the wall that were allowing the orange glow of lighting to escape through. 

I could of sworn that I was seeing a flickering of movement over the slight view of lighting that was emanating from the cracks, so I decided to grab a broken piece of brick and etch away at the cracks as quietly as I could. 

35 minutes later I had managed to etch a hole just large enough to get an eye over, and what I saw at first glance left me unable to comprehend anything:

It appeared that I was currently located on the back wall of a stage that descended down into a great ballroom. Their standing with his back to me on stage was a man dressed in khaki-colored uniform of sorts with slicked back but stark whiteish blonde hair. He was shouting emphatically into an ancient microphone before a crowd of what had to be at least 120 people, all adorned in ball gowns and those same tan military style uniforms. They were all incredibly pale white or almost translucent in their skin pigmentation and they all had that same stark blonde hair. 

The sensory overload I experienced in that moment was unreal, as I began to comprehend that there was both old and young people in that crowd. Where did they all live? How did they have food? How did they even have electricity down here? All of the common sense questions for defining how a civilization of people could thrive underground all these years flooded my mind, but that wasn’t the worst part. 

What struck the most was the language being spoken. I’m no linguistic expert, but I know German when I hear it, and when I realized the men wore red bands around the arms of their uniforms that displayed a symbol that we all know to represent evil, it all came flooding to my comprehensive abilities. 

It was about then that my wife startled me with her shriek of desperation from the top of the cistern about calling 911. 

Fortunately the ballroom music was so loud that the party on the other side of the wall never heard this, so I opted to play calm for my wife when in reality I was trying to remain undetected. 

The ambulance and first responders soon had me fished out of the hole after lowering a rope. I didn’t dare speak of what I’d seen for fear of being accused of insanity, and because I needed time to decide for myself how to accept what I’d seen. 

It’s now the third night and the music has started up again. I’m thankful that my wife was so exhausted from the drama of the previous evening to hear it. As I lay here in bed with a cast over my right leg and a tunnel into hell just outside of my bedroom window, I have to wonder:

What am I going to do about those bastards living under my home?
