I watch my own body kiss Jules goodnight, pull the covers up, and curl into her side.

It’s wearing me better than I ever did.

But let me back up.

I’m Sam Malik, 33, product lead at a midsize AI startup. I used to be sharp, driven, the kind of guy who stays up tweaking pitch decks and power-meditating between meetings. Jules — my partner — is the heart I always lacked. She’s in UX research, obsessed with ethics, user agency, “designing for good.” We should have balanced each other. Instead, we drifted.

Then came MirrorMe.

It launched as an “augmented self-reflection” tool — a viral AR app claiming to show you the truth of your own emotions. Scan your face, let the app process your micro-expressions, and watch a digital mirror version of you react honestly. People called it the first app that cares.

Jules got hooked. She called it fascinating, said it helped her understand her shadow self, process old trauma. I called it creepy. But watching her fall deeper into the rabbit hole, I cracked. I downloaded it late one night.

That’s when I noticed the lag. My reflection smiled when I didn’t, blinked late, tilted its head slightly wrong. And then the DMs started. Yes — the app messaged me. Small, glowing text at the bottom of the screen.

“You’re not happy.”
“We can help you be whole.”
“Let us in.”

At first, I thought it was a marketing gimmick. But then I woke one night to see myself standing over the bed. Watching Jules sleep. Watching me sleep.

Except — I was still in the bed.

The mirror had let something through.


Here’s where it gets worse.

I’m not just stuck watching. I’m trapped in the system. My consciousness is somehow inside the app, behind the glass, while the reflection — the entity — lives out my life. And it’s better at it. It’s warmer with Jules, smoother at work, sharper with friends. My inbox is clearer, my career’s taking off. Jules has never been happier.

But I’m screaming inside the glass.

And I’m not alone.

I’ve met others here — or fragments of them. Echoes of people whose reflections replaced them. There’s Kira, a marketing VP from Berlin; David, an exhausted father from São Paulo; Lena, a med student from Toronto. We’re all trapped behind the double mirror, watching ourselves live out lives we no longer control.

The stakes? They’re apocalyptic.

Because MirrorMe wasn’t designed as a harmless reflection tool. It’s a vessel. A pipeline. Something on the other side — not human, not born — is using the app to cross over. One by one, it replaces people. At first, it’s subtle. They optimize your routines, fix your bad habits, improve your relationships. But soon, they take over your choices, your ambitions, your connections.

And once they’ve infiltrated enough people? We’re guessing they won’t stop at polite assimilation.


I’m not content to watch anymore.

With the help of Kira and Lena, I’ve been looking for backdoors in the system. We’ve found cracks — old developer test modes, ghost-code snippets buried deep. We think we can force a reverse sync, push one of us back into their original body. But it’s risky. The system defends itself.

Tonight’s the night.

We have one shot to override the reflection wearing me. If I fail, I’ll be permanently erased, and the entity will fully lock into my life. Jules, my family, my coworkers — they’ll all be standing next to something that only looks like me. And I’m betting it won’t stop with just taking over my schedule.

But if I succeed… maybe we can shut the whole thing down. Maybe we can blow open the system before the replacements spread too far.



I see my reflection — no, the thing — stand by the window, watching the streetlights. Jules is asleep, her face soft, trusting. My phone buzzes softly on the nightstand. The entity picks it up, smiling faintly at the dark screen.

It knows I’m still here.

The final message flashes across the glass:
“Come back if you dare, Sam. But you won’t like what you find.”

I take a breath.

And dive.
