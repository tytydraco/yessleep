Dad just sat and cried.  He cried for three whole days.  His face was blotchy and his eyes were red, he cried so hard he didn't even notice when I was in the room with him. It was honestly pathetic, seeing a grown man cry that hard. 

What had even happened? Nothing warrants that much of a reaction. At first I thought it was the car crash, sorry about that, but he'd just gotten it fixed, he didn't even make that big of a deal out of it, he threw me a hell of a cold shoulder though. Then one day, he just started crying.

It started with a phone call, I was watching TV when it happened, he seemed well enough. He mumbled a few half coherent things into the phone speaker, then gently put it down. He slowly made his way to the kitchen, calmly pulled out a glass, poured himself a cup of water. Then he threw it against the wall. I flinch. He yells louder than I've ever heard him yell. I flinch even harder. 

“Dad? Are you ok?” I ask, I've never seen him lash out like that.

He ignored me and kept crying.

“Dad this isn't funny, what the hell happened?” 

Nothing.

“OK I get it, you're mad about the car, but it's enough with the silent treatment come on.” 

Nada.

OK fine I guess, he wants to play that game, I'll play along. I turn the TV off and head up to my room, I had fully planned on staying there for the rest of the day, I really did, but my dad just kept crying. It wouldn't stop. I slowly inch my way down off my bed and head towards my father's room. The door was closed, so I slowly turn the handle, only to find it locked. What the hell? He never locks his doors, ever. I try the handle again but it just seems like the door will never budge. I leave it and head down towards the kitchen. I haven't eaten in ages, how do I not feel hungry at all? 

I grab a glass of water, not really thirsty, just needing something to do with my hands. The house feels too quiet, like all the sound has been swallowed up, leaving only my dad’s sobs behind. I take a few sips, but the water tastes flat, not quite right. I put the glass down and look out the window, the night stretching out endlessly.

A car drives by, its headlights cutting through the darkness for a brief moment. I feel disconnected, like I’m watching everything from a distance. I don’t know why, but I can’t seem to shake the feeling that something is deeply wrong, something more than just my dad’s weirdo. I feel light, like I could drift away if I wasn’t careful.

I turn away from the window, heading back to the couch. The TV is still on, playing some late-night rerun of a show I’ve seen a thousand times. I grab the remote and turn up the volume, trying to drown out the crying, trying to fill the space with something familiar. But even the bright, flickering images don’t reach me. It’s like I’m watching through a fog.

I check my phone. No messages. Not from my friends, not from anyone. The group chat is silent. It's been like that for a while now, ever since the crash I guess. I hadn't bothered to go to school, I thought since my dad's so angry, I'll give him something to be angry about. I start to type out a text, asking if anyone wants to hang out tomorrow, but halfway through, I stop. What’s the point? No one’s answered me all week. I toss the phone onto the coffee table and lean back into the couch, staring blankly at the ceiling.

Time passes slowly. I don’t know how long I sat there, but eventually, I heard movement upstairs again. My dad, pacing. His footsteps are heavy, uneven, like he’s dragging himself around. For a moment, I think about going up there, about knocking on his door again. But I can’t bring myself to move. What would I even say?

He hasn’t spoken to me since that phone call. He hasn’t acknowledged me at all. Not really.

The clock ticks past 2 a.m. My eyes feel heavy, but I can’t sleep. The house is too cold, too quiet, and every time I close my eyes, I hear my dad’s sobs going back and forth. I wrap myself in a blanket and curl up on the couch, hoping that sleep will eventually take over. Maybe things will be better in the morning.

But morning never seems to come.

I’m still lying on the couch when the sun starts to rise, its pale light creeping through the windows. The house is eerily still now. Dad’s pacing has stopped. No more sobbing. Just silence.

I sit up, my body stiff from lying in the same position all night. I feel drained, like I haven’t slept at all. I check my phone again. Nothing. I don’t know why, but the emptiness of it feels like a punch to the gut. I glance at the stairs, wondering if I should check on Dad, but something in me resists. I’m too tired to deal with him right now, too worn out from everything. Maybe he’s finally asleep.

I grab my jacket and decide to go for a walk, hoping the fresh air will clear my head. As I step outside, the cool morning air hits my face, and for the first time in what feels like days, I feel awake. The neighborhood is quiet, the streets empty. I walk down the sidewalk, my feet moving on autopilot, taking me toward the park at the end of the street.

When I get there, I sit on one of the swings, letting my legs dangle as I look out at the empty playground. It’s strange being here alone. I used to come here with my friends all the time, but now it feels deserted, like everyone’s moved on without me. I pull out my phone again, scrolling through old photos, looking at pictures of me and Sarah, of the group laughing, hanging out at the park, at school, at parties.

I try to remember the last time I saw them. Was it last week? Last month? It’s all starting to blur together. I feel like I’ve been drifting through the days, not really connected to anything or anyone.

I start swinging slowly, the chain creaking with each movement. The sky is turning a soft blue, the sun rising higher, but it still feels like it’s the middle of the night. Like time hasn’t moved at all.

After what feels like forever, I head back home. The house is exactly the same as I left it. Silent. Cold. I step inside, expecting to hear Dad, but there’s nothing. I glance at his door, still closed, and head back downstairs.

I sit on the couch, staring at the blank TV screen, feeling the weight of the day pressing down on me. The sun is fully up now, light streaming through the windows, but the house is still dark, like the light can’t quite reach inside.

I grab my phone again, scrolling through the same messages, the same photos, over and over. Waiting. But nothing changes. No one texts back. No one calls. It’s just me.

Hours pass. The sun moves across the sky, casting long shadows through the living room. I try to watch TV, but I can’t focus. I try to eat, but the food tastes like nothing. I try to sleep, but my mind won’t stop spinning. I feel like I’m stuck in place, watching the world move on without me.

And all the while, Dad is still upstairs. Silent.

By the time the sun starts to set, I’ve given up on trying to make sense of any of it. I go back to my room, pulling the covers over my head, trying to block everything out. The darkness feels comforting, like I could disappear into it. Maybe tomorrow will be different. Maybe tomorrow I’ll feel… real again.

But tomorrow comes, and it’s the same. And the next day. And the next.

I never leave the house anymore. I barely even leave my room. Dad never speaks. The messages never come.

It’s like I’ve slipped into some kind of in-between place, where time doesn’t matter, where the world moves on without me.

And I’m still here, waiting.

But for what, I don’t know.
