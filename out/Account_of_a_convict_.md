My immediate intention in recounting this is to expose to the world, in a direct and succinct manner, these events laden with dire consequences that haunted, tortured, and consumed me. I am a Nervous Man, but I haven't always been this way. Even in my youth, I was already a man on the fringes of sanity. From a young age, I was treated with a degree of indifference by both people and my parents, but I learned to cope with it.

I was there at that time, just over 18 years old,  playing with my younger brother. We played everything we found amusing: hide and seek, cops and robbers, among others. Despite being 18, I still found joy in playing with my younger brother. The innocence of those moments is something I will never forget. It was on this day that tragedy was about to unfold, changing our lives forever.

Tired of playing, we went to find something else to do. My brother suggested playing hide and seek inside the house. That day, everything seemed peaceful, but you can't imagine how that scene became etched in my mind, even in my nightmares.

My brother hid so well that it was hard to find him. It seemed like he wasn't even in the house - "Surely the little rascal cheated, so neither I nor anyone else would find him," I thought at that moment.

Oh, if only that were true! It would have been better if he wasn't home that day! I looked for him in the backyard where we used to play, but there was no trace of him there. After scouring the yard, I searched the tree, behind bushes, and behind the house, but nothing. I thought he might really be at home, hidden very well. I returned to the house and searched every possible hiding place, but the search was fruitless.               

 I heard a noise coming from the upstairs bedroom and thought he might be there. I went to the room slowly, but he wasn't there. The room was well-lit, and from the window, you could see the backyard outside. Frustrated, I shouted his name, claiming I had found him. It wasn't true, but it was an idea that might make the little troublemaker reveal himself.

When I heard a laugh, I looked around but saw no one, only a large old cedar wardrobe in the room. I thought, "Ah, he's in there." I decided to give him a scare when he opened the wardrobe door. I went to a dresser nearby, grabbed Dad's shotgun - obviously, that would frighten him. I approached the wardrobe slowly, opened the door slowly, and said, "Found you," pointing the barrel of the gun at his face, just to scare him.

I opened the door quickly, and there he was, frightened by the gun. He screamed, I got scared, and I pulled the trigger. A fatal shot hit his head, and he fell bloodied inside the wardrobe. Panic consumed me; I dropped the gun and ran away. My parents alarmed, my mother called from below, "My God, Jack, Billy, what happened up there?" Disturbed mind, heavy steps like a specter haunting me, I descended to the lower floor. Even in that state, I tried to calm myself, washed my hands in the nearby bathroom sink, my mind flooded with a thousand thoughts, but I quickly went down the stairs.

My parents greeted me with fearful looks, asked what had happened, and I just sobbed, placing my cold hands over my mouth. My father widened his eyes: "Jack, what the hell have you done?" approaching me. He went upstairs; my frightened mother followed immediately and witnessed the terrible scene. Hearing a scream of despair from my mother, followed by crying, they stayed there, and I didn't know what to do.

I went upstairs, where I saw my father consoling my mother. They didn't notice my presence when I arrived, but soon my father realized, his expression changed, seeking revenge. He pulled his belt from his pants and hit me hard. I felt like garbage, but amidst the belt lashes, I entered the room; my mother pleaded for him to stop, but he paid no heed. I fell to the floor, already in a lot of pain, and he kept hitting me even harder. I felt a coldness in him, and while crying and sobbing in pain, I also felt a mix of emotions: resentment, despair, remorse, and even more anger. I turned my face and saw the pistol on the floor. There it was, revealing the heinous crime. Full of resentment, my father punished me mercilessly and insulted me. So, I turned my attention to the pistol, and on impulse, I crawled as fast as I could to it. My father tried to wrest it from my hands, delivering more belt lashes, hurting my hands to make me let go. Filled with hatred, I raised the barrel and pulled the trigger, hitting him in the chest. He put his hands on his chest in shock, and I fired another shot that struck his shoulder, making him fall sprawled on the floor, forming a pool of blood.              

I struggled to get up. My mother looked horrified, staring at me as if I were a criminal. Yes, I had undoubtedly become a criminal that day. I looked at her, turned away, and stumbled away. I stopped on the lower floor, tripped on the stairs, rolled down. Even though walking was difficult, I thought the neighbors would soon realize what had happened from the sounds of the gunshots. I got up and ran as fast as I could down the street, aimless, without family, without anyone, just away from anyone close.

I ran for a long time and stopped to rest almost at dusk, in a smaller town nearby. I spent the night there, recovering. I stopped to rest in a clearing nearby to catch my breath and think about what to do. I thought, and ended up crying; I was paranoid that day when I thought about finding somewhere to stay, so I thought about my friend Carl's house. He was an old high school friend, so without thinking twice, I headed to his house about 3 kilometers away from where I was.

Carl greeted me with surprise; he didn't expect me to visit him that night. He saw me in that deplorable state and asked what had happened. I replied that I had been robbed and beaten on the way while coming by motorcycle. He still didn't know what had happened, so he believed it, and he welcomed me into his home. Carl was a nice guy, good-looking, physically fit, and quite sociable, but he was addicted to smoking, having acquired that habit in the 1st year.

He quickly helped me sit on the sofa, gave me a glass of water, and then went to get some medicine for my wounds. I declined him seeing my wounds better despite his insistence, so I asked to take a shower, which he allowed. I entered the bathroom and turned on the water; I had many belt marks, and as the water hit my body, it changed color, as if even the bathroom was stained with strawberry juice. After the shower, he gently took me to his room— "Man, it looks like your situation was really bad, but don't worry, I'll inform the police about what happened. Where were you attacked?" I was immediately filled with panic when he mentioned the police— "Don't do that," I said in a loud tone, making Carl scared— "Oh, okay then," he said somewhat awkwardly. I asked to be left alone, which he respected. Poor Carl, I didn't deserve his help; I was almost falling asleep when I started to think that Carl might find out what had happened. I would certainly be arrested! This disturbed me. After thinking, I decided it was better to just spend the night there to recover; surely, Carl wouldn't go out at night or call the police. So, I slept despite the difficulty caused by the pain and slept deeply.

At dawn, I was awakened by a beam of light coming from the window. I saw Carl with a paper in his hand in front of the TV. He told me to leave the house, saying I shouldn't have come. I tried to explain, but he was nervous, asking me to go away and that he would call the police. This terrified me. He wanted me to be arrested. I tried to leave, but Carl still threatened me. I lunged at him, mad with rage, but he countered with a punch. I went to the back door, which was locked. Carl seemed like he would grab some weapon to defend himself. Near the kitchen, I grabbed a sharp knife, and when he approached, I struck the blade in his neck. The gun fired a shot into the wall, and he fell lifeless. I no longer felt remorse, just resentment for being unjustly treated throughout my life.      

 I took the gun from the body, stole a shirt and pants from Carl, and then left. I lived as a fugitive for two years, getting arrested in Las Vegas when the local police discovered my hideout. Since then, I've been in this prison. Maybe they think I'm crazy. Well, maybe I am. But look at how I talk about all this perfectly. I spent some time in rehabilitation, but it didn't help much; it just made me more withdrawn and paranoid. I shared my story behind bars, just to expose how much I regret everything I did. I'm not a monster. I'm a sick man; I'll probably die in this cell, rightfully for everything I've done. May God forgive me.
