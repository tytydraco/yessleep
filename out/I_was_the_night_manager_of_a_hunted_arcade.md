You don’t expect to get haunted working at a damn arcade. Sticky soda floors, screaming kids, busted ticket machines, yeah. But real ghosts? No one trains you for that.

I was the manager of **The Pit**—a local mega-arcade that used to be an old strip club owned by some gangsters before they turned it into a flashing, buzzing kid-trap. Everyone in town went there. Birthday parties. First dates. Sad divorces, probably. It was always busy. Loud. And underneath that noise? Something else.

It started in **the laser tag arena**.

The arena had this swinging black door, no lock, just one of those push-to-open types. But every now and then, it wouldn’t open. You’d slam into it and it felt like someone was holding it shut on the other side—*pushing back*. And there was no one else in there. I’d be alone.

We all joked about it at first. Called it “Frank,” after the tall shadow figure we’d seen more than once. He’d stand beside you in the laser tag office, watch from the loft above the arcade, arms crossed. I’d glance up and there he’d be. Still. Watching. The second you looked straight at him, *gone*. The employees started clocking sightings like it was normal. Like: “Yo, Frank’s in the ticket counter again.” “Cool, let him know we’re outta Tootsie Rolls.”

But it wasn’t funny for long.

There was also **her**. We didn’t give her a name. She didn't want one. A *little girl*—long black hair, dirty dress, eyes that didn’t shine under the fluorescents. She mimicked voices. That’s how she got you.

“Ash... come in here…” It would echo out from the laser tag maze. Like a coworker was calling me. Like someone needed help. But I was alone. Every. Time.

I started bringing gear. Stuff I bought after falling down ghost-hunting YouTube rabbit holes: spirit boxes, those cat ball toys that light up when touched, a cheap EMF detector, even a REM Pod. I convinced the night shift crew—Zach and Josh—to help me. We’d wait until the place was slow and empty and try to talk to whatever was there.

The spirit box would sputter, and sometimes—*sometimes*—a voice would break through.

“Don’t... leave...” “Stay...” “Demon…”

I never told the others what that last one meant. Not really.

See, **I already had something attached to me**. Stupid teenage me, trying to impress my friends in a graveyard. Ouija board. Candle circle. Some Latin we read off a Tumblr post. Classic cursed starter pack. Ever since then, I’d feel watched in mirrors, hear my name whispered in static, dream about black dogs with too many teeth.

So when things got worse—when the hauntings started bleeding into **our homes**—I knew I was the problem.

 Zach said his lights would flicker and he would see shadow people in his house when he was alone. And his pet birds would start talking to things that weren’t even there.

And me? I’d wake up to the sound of *my own voice* calling from the hallway. “Ash… Ash… Ash…” Then silence. Then the sound of something breathing just behind the door.

Eventually, corporate let me go. “Budget reasons,” they said. Sure. But I saw the way they looked at me. Like I was *bringing something with me*. Like they were scared of *me* now.

It’s been almost 2 years...

I moved. New job. No arcades. No graveyards. But the hauntings never stopped. The shadows still stretch wrong in the corners of my bedroom. The cat balls still light up at 3AM, rolling toward my bed. My name still gets whispered by a voice that sounds like mine.

And sometimes, when I glance in the mirror…

It’s watching.
