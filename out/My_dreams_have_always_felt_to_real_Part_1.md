Now my dreams have always felt too real, not the situations. Because we’ve all had dreams where if you think about it for a minute, you’ll be lost. Like you're in a random city fighting a monster, or you're in the middle of the ocean learning karate, I had one where I was fighting Russian paratroopers with my little brothers. Like sometimes nothing makes any sense, but it’s not the situations that make it real, it’s how everything plays out, like if the wacky situation were real, this is exactly how it would happen. And it’s not just that, the people in my dreams play the situation completely straight, like they act as if it was really happening. It freaks me out sometimes, As if maybe the woman who lost her son in the woods, actually lost her son in the woods. 

(Dream 1)

Before we begin, I like to call the first few dreams (The Rainbow Dreams). This period of time lasted from when I was six to eight years old, and these dreams were crazy vivid, like 1:1 with actual reality. they could both be good and bad. The reason I call them rainbow dreams is that to get out of the dreams, I would have to find a small rainbow with clouds at the ends floating two feet above the ground, and if I didn’t find it I would be stuck in the dream. I don’t know who told me to find the rainbows but all I know is that someone did, and that I listened to them. 

Now to the dream, from what I recall the floor was made of such a beautifully dark gray smooth cement, and that I was shoeless. Around me for all I could see, was white sheets clipped to clothing lines, all of them just barely touching the ground. It kinda looked like those liminal spaces, but cranked to eleven. There was nothing bad about the place from what I remember, the only odd thing there was, is that no one there, not a soul. but I couldn't be there for long, as I would be stuck there. I walked through the place, lifting up sheets and just looking for the rainbow. After a short while I found the rainbow hiding behind a sheet, touched it and woke up, that’s usually how most of these went. But when they were bad, they were bad. 

(Dream 2)

I was with 8 members, my mom, some aunties 
and cousins. We were walking in the most colorful forest ever. Like if you told me it was a magical forest I would 100% believe you, the forest had biggest trees I’d ever seen, they looked exactly like the German Sherman trees, just not as tall and with darker green leaves. There were also mushrooms everywhere, ranging from about ½ to a full foot tall, they were unbelievably vibrant, looking at them would cause the surrounding environment to shift colors. All was fine as I was kind of enamored by how beautiful everything looked. But as we continued walking through the forest, my mom got a bit curious about the mushrooms, and picked one up, as soon as she did, one of the trees bent over and ate her, the sound it made was horrible, it was like if someone was in a hydraulic press and you heard each and every one of the bones breaking.

I don’t remember being scared as I was more shocked, I stood there like an idiot with my family screaming and yelling at me to get away from the trees, but it was like the trees were attracted to noise, and every time one of us would yell another one of us would get eaten, the faces my family made while the got eaten were so real, like if I was about to get eaten that’s the face I would make. This happened until it was just me and two of my cousins, we all started running through the forest looking for any place that didn’t have trees. But as we’re running I saw a rainbow to the left of me, and I immediately bolted towards it, when I did, my cousins started screaming my name and said “where are you going” and “please don’t leave us” a little personal belief of mine is that whatever happens in a dream actually happens, maybe not to you but maybe an alternate version of you and to an alternate version of that person your dreaming of, so when I left that dream, apart of me thinks that I actually left them in that forest. 

(Dream 3)

Now we’ve all had dreams where something is just out of place, like a bookshelf in your house is missing, or you're eating something you know you would never eat. For me the messed up ones were when your family wasn’t your family. I remember being outside my Kukom’s house (Kukom cree for grandmother) I walked up to the door and knocked. While waiting for the door to open I noticed how quiet the street was, and how dusty everything in the distance looked. When the door opened I saw, there’s no word that can describe what I saw, but it was wearing my Kukom’s skin, the closest resemblance I could find were the pictures of blobfish that get depressurized when they come to the surface. it was like a monster who didn’t have any skin stole my Kukom’s then put it on and pretended to be her. The monster itself was too big for her skin so where my Kukom’s belly would be there was just the monster's red flesh spilling out. And the head and face of my Kukom was hollowed out and worn like a hat. Where the arms would be, there were red tentacles. I was petrified, I couldn’t speak, and I wanted to run, but whatever was in my Kukom’s skin grabbed me by the shoulder and invited me inside the house.

As I went inside I saw my Mushom (Cree for Grandfather) his body and face were so elongated that the skin was ripping apart, and there was no way he could stand in the house. He was sitting on the couch waiting for me to come and hug him. And when I looked to my left I saw my aunt whose head was stretched from side to side so far she could only keep it in one place inside the house. None of them had my family’s voices, but they were all acting as if they did. Telling me to come sit, and eat. I started crying and asking for my family back, then the thing that was in my Kukom’s skin hugged me and said “we’re right here” I slipped away and got outside the door and frantically started looking for the rainbow. Thankfully it was in the dust, but the closer I got to it, the thicker the dust became, it was like walking through water. But I eventually touched it and woke up. Sadly for my mom I woke up crying and screaming, fun times.

(Dream 4)

As I remember this was the last rainbow dream I ever had, and it sucked. It started off fine, I was in my room playing with hot wheels cars when my door slammed open, when I looked to see who it was I saw two men in business suits just standing there, looking at me. They looked pretty normal from what I saw, no oddities with their faces or anything. But as soon as I was about to say something they turned off my light and slammed my door shut. It was the hardest I’ve ever seen a door shut, it made it seem like I was in a cellar. After that my room was pitch black, and I just sat there waiting. 

I don’t know what the feeling of knowing that you’re about to die is like, but I assume it’s fairly close to what I experience, so when that feeling of death came, it wasn’t something you could just say no to. And I guess I kind of just accepted it. Once I did my wall ate me, usually today when I have dreams that I die in, I wake up, think about it for a minute. Then just go about my day. But in this dream once I died I just appeared in my papa's house (papa is my grandfather on my moms side). Now my papa's house has two floors, you could use both floors to get outside of the house because the house itself was built on a slant. I appeared at the bottom of the staircase on the second floor, and immediately felt something coming for me. If you’ve ever felt dread or had a dream of being chased you know exactly what I mean. As soon as I knew something was coming for me, I looked around to see where it was coming from, what I saw when I looked towards the living room was the most physically darkest thing I had ever seen, whatever was chasing me was completely black, the darkness around the humanoid figure was warping and contorting to try and match the figures own emptiness. and it was slowly making its way towards me, I tried running up the staircase, but dream logic kicked in, and as I tried running I just couldn’t move. I wish I knew why I kept looking back at it, because every time I did it got closer and closer. it eventually grazed my shoulder with its finger, then I saw its face.

Its face was completely empty, just a black void, no life, no death, nothing before or after, I could never describe how scared I was. But as it touched my shoulder I was able to bolt up the stairs. As soon as I did, I opened the door to get outside. But outside was a nightmare too, the blackness the figure had was in the sky, all the stars were gone, and whatever brightness was left was fading away. it became much more difficult to move, not because of the dream logic, but because of the wind. I've never seen a tree bend like that due to wind, but most of them were in 90 degree angles. As I slowly moved on the side of my Papa’s house step by step. Until I saw a rainbow floating at the bottom of the slope next to my Papa’s shed. When I say it took forever to get down there I mean it, dreams for me don’t necessarily last that long, but this was the longest dream I had ever had and nothing has ever came closer. but that wasn’t the worst part, because  it was getting unbelievably dark, like everything around me was slowly being consumed by a void. As I was so relieved when I touched the rainbow, I can’t describe the weight that was lifted off my shoulders. Once I woke up I was exhausted, like I just fought a bear or something, when I went to my mom, she said I had slept for 12 hours. Then after that I never saw those rainbows again. I like to imagine that I finally escaped the cycle of whatever I was dealing with, but I’ll never know. 

(Dream 5)

This next dream isn’t scary at all, but it really changed my point of view on what I want from life. It happened pretty recently too so I got a better recollection of it. I was talking with a girl with the most dark beautiful hair imaginable, and instantly knew she was my wife, it felt like I’d known her my whole life and knew everything about her. Sadly I can’t recount what it was, but I always find it strange when you're in a dream and you just know something, like no one told you but you came to the dream prepackaged with the information that this version of you was dealing with. In my dream wife’s  arms was the most adorable looking baby girl on the planet. and I didn’t realize it at the time but I was the happiest I had ever been, like a war could happen tomorrow and I would still think how great life was. 

Turns out the baby was mine and I was going on a business trip. I was saying goodbye to them and kissed both of them. You know how sometimes in a dream you just skip to something else for no apparent reason, as I was saying goodbye, the dream skipped like a cutscene and I was aboard the plane to wherever, but the entire time I was thinking of how much I missed seeing them, I called my dream wife over the phone and talked to her, her voice was calm and soothing, and felt like pancakes. then the dream ended. When I woke up I was mad, and so damn jealous. Like why does that version of me get to be so damn happy and have a perfect wife. But now it’s something to look forward to. I just think how crazy it is that how some dreams can impact you, I have a lot more fucked up dreams that I will be sharing like sleep paralysis, and shit that could be turned into right up horror movies, but it’s getting late so goodnight and let me know if you come across a small rainbow.
