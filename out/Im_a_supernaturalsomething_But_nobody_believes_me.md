I've been able to see ghosts since I was little. Mama always thought I was making it up, but I could see them clear as day. 

At least, I thought they were ghosts for a while. Once I got to about 9, I realized some of them were... something else. Something more evil. 

Demons. 

Then when I hit puberty, I got my power. 

It started with my eyes. My irises were brown before. By the time I was 14, they were nearly pure black. 

Then came the fire. 

Mama was constantly telling me I had a fever, keeping me home from school, stuffing pills down me.  I can stand outside in the snow at 10^(o) wearing shortsleeves and jeans, and not feel cold. The heat doesn't affect me - I can work in the sun at 110^(o) and barely break a sweat. Fire burns brighter when I'm around, it's very hard for me to be burned by anything - even hot metal, and I can stand so close to a bonfire that the flames lick at me and not feel the heat. 

When I'm wounded, it heals entirely within a couple days. I have super high endurance, and can stay up for days without being tired, although that might be the programmer part of me. Except for when I kill a demon, that drains me.

Oh, I left that out? 

Yeah, I can control the demons now. Although usually they're trying to kill me, so I have to kill them. 

Take last night as an example. 

It was midnight.

 I was still awake. Like usual. I rarely fell asleep before 1am anymore.

Since lying in bed staring at the ceiling was doing no good at all, I silently crept out of my bed and went outside. It was pitch dark, but I didn't mind.  Darkness had always comforted me. It made me feel even more alive - my senses were heightened, my heart rate went up a little, and I felt... peace. Peace and adrenaline at the same time. Paradoxical, yeah I know. But I loved it.

Sitting there on the wooden steps with a cat on each side of me like palace guards, I leaned back and looked up at the starry sky above me. It was beautiful. I loved the sheer dark openness of space. Made me feel free, like I wasn't being crowded.

I got to enjoy my peace for a while.

Then, I felt it.

Something was watching me, and it wasn't good. I know an evil presence when I sense one. I, very slowly, turned my head to the right, where I sensed the presence.

A pair of bright yellow eyes blinked at me from six feet off the ground.

"Fuck..."

I snapped upright, jumped off the stairs and stood up, shifting to a fighting stance. My cats ran to hide under my car - they knew they were no match for this thing. I looked into its yellow eyes and growled - a deep, rough, dark, strangely inhuman sound. It blinked again and moved toward me, then stopped. I advanced towards it, now able to see its outline - it reminded me of an alien, like one of the Grays, but it wasn't an alien. It was something darker. A demon. 

It looked confused now. Its eyes turned darker, almost orangey-red. 

And my eyes turned black with flecks of flame-orange. Almost as if they had fire behind them. 

I growled again, louder. The demon stepped back and I took another step forward. Now I had it backed up against the wall of the house. It had nowhere to go. 

I could feel my body heating up, my power getting stronger. I waited, the orange in my eyes burning brighter, until I was at full strength. It took only a few moments. 

I touched the wood of the porch. My fingers left char marks. Excellent.

In a different voice than my natural one - deeper, more primal - I said, "Time for you to go home." And I reached out and tapped the demon's chest, where its heart should be. Its eyes turned dull black, like burnt wood, and it vaporized with a grating, eerie scream.  

I was exhausted now. I went back into the house and fell into bed, passing out as soon as my head hit the pillow. If these demons don't stop trying to get me soon, I'm gonna go into a coma. 

Oh well. I suppose exhaustion is a small price to pay for keeping the world, or at least my town, safe from the creatures of the underworld. And having this cool fire power is a definite plus. 

I still sometimes wish it wasn't me, though. It's a lonely existence, everyone telling you that you make things up when you know damn well that however unbelievable it is, your life, and your power, is real.

  


  
I'm posting this here in hope of finding someone who will believe me... and maybe finding out what I am. If you understand this any more than I do, I'll take any help I can get.
