Zombie like outbreaks  but instead of a virus, it's an alien or mutated species of ant that turns its victims into a mobile nest having cleared out the body of all but the necessary organs and muscles and filled the interior of the carcass with sand and dirt and other nested building material. You're nothing left but muscle skin bone tendons a heart lung and brains completely dependent on the colony to keep you living as you travel from City to City infecting more people increasing the hives population

Scenario 1.

You see a withered looking husk shambling down the road and as they approach you begin to notice black dots crawling or trailing all over their body. Once they're close enough that you should be able to see details on their face you begin to realize that their bugs but as they get closer and the details get finer you begin to realize that they're not just bugs but that these bugs are crawling in and out of this person's mouth and nose and ears in trails and groups like an active ant hill.

You begin to stumble backwards and start to turn around but before you break your line of sight of them, their mouth drops as a black mass flows out of their mouth in a large swarm of ants pour out into the street and engulf you and you feel them working their way into every hole cutting and chewing and knowing away at you. Your innards, you're intestines, your kidneys and testicles and ovaries devoured or dragged out of your mouth and other orifices, dragged out of their new nest like unwanted drapes and carpeting until you too have been turned into a nest.

Just the sound of them crawling and scratching around inside of your skull and inside of your ears and behind your eyes.

Sometimes they pour out of your mouth to swarm it straight dog or cat, other times you find yourself going to vomit in a trash can only for the ants to come out instead and to drag into you anything they think of as food.

Scenario 2.

You have your dog outside at night when the pandemic first started, you're sound asleep until you hear your dog bark and Yelp but when you go outside, it's gone.

2 weeks pass by until you see your dog again; excited you are up to it and you immediately go to hug it but after a moment when the incitement has cleared away just enough, you begin to realize something is wrong.

Your dog reeks of death but that's not the worst of it; Tuffs of fur keep falling off of him every time you go to pet him order rub at him, there's no breath no panting not even the sides of his chest seem to be rising or lowering giving signs of breathing.

The dog just stands there staring at you with a blank expression but that's when you feel it, the crawling across the back of your hand end up and down your arm hair. 

You pull your hand away to see it covered in ants as they March rapidly up your arm you go to brush them off but that's when you hear a low dry Dusty growl coming from your dog. You look at them only to see them jump at you and as they give you one massive lick across the face a swarm of ants come charging across like knights upon A drawbridge!

You scream and try to wipe them away as they burrow into your sockets and your dog lunges once more at you taking a large bite out of the side of your chest. The ants pour into the gaping wound and just as quickly begin to patch the hole making quick work on your insides as they construct their new home within you.

Scenario 3.

Perhaps this random person has found themselves kept alive being farmed by these human ant colonies.

Humans are forced to farm food and reproduce while elderly population are used to feed the colony and people deemed unfit for labor or those who are deemed too dangerous to be kept alive are turned into new nests.

Of course they may also occasionally turn children or parents or your loved ones into nests as a form of punishment or just as a cruel way to remind you they are in charge.

There's no bright side to this movie and it just keeps getting worse.

Maybe the plot ends with this person inevitably being turned into a nest and finding to their horror that they are still conscious even after the prcoess has been completed.

The ants control everything in him yet they preserve his consciousness and if it's not just insanity, it seems as if their scratching in his ears is being done in a rhythmic manner to sound like Whispers tormenting and mocking him, narrating all the Terrible Things they are making him do to his loved ones as he eats his neighbor's kids to sustain The Colony or infects his son to keep his wife in line after she tried pleading with him.
