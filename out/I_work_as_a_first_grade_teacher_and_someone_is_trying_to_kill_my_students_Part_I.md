[Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z7j5rw/i_work_as_a_first_grade_teacher_and_someone_is/)

Three of the students in my class all happened to have the same birthday, so I asked everyone to bring in candy so we could throw a party in their honor. The candy was then set aside in the far corner of the classroom, to be devoured at the end of the school day, when our party was set to take place.

Between the beginning and end of the school day, the only time when the classroom had been left uninhabited was during lunch hour, when its door had been left unlocked. But by the time we had noticed the unexplained disappearance of most of what had been brought in just this morning, it was the end of the day. Just five minutes before the start of the party. It was Caleb, the bespectacled redhead sitting in the back of the classroom, who first raised the alarm, turning bright red upon noticing the absence of his Twix.

His cries were soon joined by that of others, after they noticed the sudden disappearance of their own candy. After ten minutes of tantrums and accusing each other of stealing it, the kiddos settled down for what was left over—some Swedish Fish, Jolly Rangers, Candy Corn, and Smarties.

Since all the chocolate was now mysteriously out of the picture, they had to make do with what remained. It was only later that I realized that this had likely been the reason the chocolate had abruptly vanished in the first place. Not necessarily just for the sake of stealing, as it was to make the kids eat something they might have skipped out on otherwise.

Looking back, the dots all connected quite well. From what remained, there had been only one package of Swedish Fish (grabbed immediately by Kelly, who had been the one to bring them in), a smattering of Jolly Rangers (which some of the kids made faces at—all except for Mitch who enthusiastically grabbed a handful), some Candy Corn (which some kids made faces at), and stationed prominently in the center…Smarties candy rolls, wrapped in colorful plastic and loosely tied on both ends. It was only later that I would find out that the real manufacturer had long since switched to recyclable paper packaging.

Sara was the first one to reach for the Smarties first, bumping hands with Henry. Later, I would find out that sugar was banned in her house, so she was only too happy to grab on to anything she could get, with the colorful packaging attracting her attention. As for Henry, it was a process of elimination. While he had previously tasted Jolly Rangers, Candy Corn, and Swedish Fish, his taste buds had never before been exposed to Smarties. And, as a “candy connoisseur” (his dad’s moniker for him after Henry regularly cleaned out their junk food cabinet), this was something he was only too happy to correct.

And so while Sara paused to add a Candy Corn to her haul, while calculating her chances into talking Kelly into sharing some of her Swedish Fish with her, Henry went right for the Smarties. As he unwrapped one of the flimsily wrapped candy rolls, a bunch of the kids belatedly joined him while complaining about the “stolen chocolate.”

I still remembered the exact moment it all happened. As Henry popped one of the Smarties into his mouth, sucking on the candy tablet, Cameron and Barry began unwrapping it as well. Meanwhile, a bunch of the girls cornered Chaney and began accusing of her of taking all the chocolate for herself. There was no evidence at all to this accusation, but it didn’t matter to them. They had long since disliked her goody two shoes demeanor and were only too happy to find someone to blame.

It was just as I came to the defense of Chaney, who looked like she was on the cusp of getting beat up, that I heard a loud gasp, followed by a scream. I promptly forgot about Chaney for the time being, feeling suddenly uneasy.

And that’s when I saw Henry on the floor, as pale as a wall. My first instinct was that he must have choked on the candy. Panicked, I kneeled down beside him and started giving him mouth to mouth. But a closer investigation revealed he had not choked after all. While I was still figuring out what happened to him, I heard another scream behind my back—only to see Barry on the floor as well, with the remaining Smarties candy tablets rolling around on the floor between them, after having been dropped. The rest of the class froze, torn between Henry and Barry, as the realization slowly sunk in.

“Allergies?” Sally asked hopefully.

“Everybody, DON’T touch anymore candy!” I yelled. “Especially the Smarties! Jerry, can you watch over the class while I call for help?” I asked, purposely addressing the most popular kid in the class. The one with the most authority. He raised an eyebrow, but nodded, unable to hide his own shaken expression.

The incident led to a full-fledged investigation, after Henry and Barry were both taken away in an ambulance and the fake Smarties were sent to a laboratory for testing, revealing that the colorful tablets were in fact illegal drugs made to look like candy.

The entire school staff was quizzed by the police, and separate interviews were conducted with the families of each of the kids in the classroom. Jack had brought the Snickers. Cameron the Mars. Jill the M&Ms. Chaney the Hershey’s. Leon the Kisses. Henry the Twizzlers. Harriet the Kit Kat. Barry the Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. Jerry the Milk Duds. Kelly the Swedish Fish. Sara the Jolly Ranchers. Caleb the Twix. Sally the Butterfingers. Mitch the Candy Corn. Fourteen children. Fourteen varieties of candy. So who was responsible for the fake Smarties? No one had any idea what happened to the original candy that had been brought in, and denied having any knowledge of how the fake Smarties ended up in the classroom.

Two days after the incident (Henry and Barry survived, but both refused to return to school), the school employees were rounded up and forced to undergo a drug test. One custodian failed and was immediately fired. The school administration celebrated finding their guilty party (though he adamantly denied planting the poisoned Smarties) and the police arrested him before he could leave the building. A mass e-mail was immediately sent to the parents, letting them know that the perpetrator had been caught and assuring them that their children were safe. Free counseling was offered to the rest of the children in the school, and a push was made to move on.

But it didn’t end there.
