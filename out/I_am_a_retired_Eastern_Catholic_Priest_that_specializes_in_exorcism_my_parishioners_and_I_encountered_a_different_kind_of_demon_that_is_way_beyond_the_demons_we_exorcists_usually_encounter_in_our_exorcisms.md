Hi Reddit, as you can see the topic of this subreddit is about creepy stuff and being a priest for the last 20 years was filled with these kinds of stuff and I have to get it out of my chest.

•May 16, 2011•

I was already a priest for ten years at that time and I was made an exorcist priest, I've had exorcised many people and it's not like in the movies where the ritual of exorcism are exaggerated, normally these ritual of exorcism is lighter than what you'd expect but some do get very bad that they are similar to what happens in the movies but those are the most extreme of all circumstances which I have rarely seen but those are not the ones that terrified me the most.

I was doing the Divine Liturgy on a Sunday afternoon and there was nothing unusual with the day, my family, my wife, my children, and my parishioners all seem to be fine like usual, there is no drama or issues surrounding my congregation but I was still unaware of what was to come next.

The four hour liturgy was finished and I headed back to the sacristy when a teenage boy had approached me because he wanted to confess his sins and being the spiritual father of my parishioners I agreed to grant him the sacrament of confession. The boy looked depressed and horrified, his movements speak of wariness and he often looks back as if he's looking out for someone

I wouldn't tell you the details of his confession due to the seal of confession but there was one thing he told me about and it's that he has been seeing a tall man in black suit for these past 2 weeks, I asked him what does his face look like and the boy was silent, he did not answer immediately and then he spoke softly to me, "father he has no face." At first I was confused and asked the boy if he's joking.

He looked me in the eye and I said, "father, I am not joking, I summoned him and he's not coming after me, help me", I was still confused about it and asked him about the summoning. He answered me straight with an answer that today I find it horrifying, "father, I summoned him because I want to have a friend like him because I have no friends".


I asked him about how he summoned this faceless man, I already know that he has already interacted with demonic elements and that this is a case of demonic oppression but I still wanted to ask him about it because of all the years in my experience I have not encountered something like what the boy is describing.

I will quote the best from my memory but what he said was like this:

"Go into the mirror and chant Slender Man for thirteen times, turn the lights off and on for eight times and turn around, you'll see him but he'll disappear quickly. Ever since that day I kept seeing him everywhere except when I go near this church"

I told him to return the next Sunday and I'll give him deliverance but I told him not to go outside often and I'll visit him from time to time.

A week passed and I did not see him in my church and I wondered where he went but I kept on with the liturgy and returned home after, an hour later two cops knocked on my door and asked me about the boy, I told them that I did not see him and shared a few details of out interaction last Sunday and they left.

The following week was uneventful and 2 weeks passed, news spread around town about a dead body belonging to a teenager. The police reported that the body was found hanging on a tree with strange symbols carved around the skin.

They added that the body was releasing black liquid and the official autopsy reported that their are no internal organs found inside. I looked into the newspapers and I recognized the face, it was the boy that confessed to me, I was saddened and I attended the boy's funeral. I did not know much about the thing that took the boy back then but I was determined to find out what that thing is.

Two years have already passed since the boy's disappearance I met a young woman by the name of Elizabeth, she told me that she was a recent convert to Catholicism from occultism.

By that time I already knew a lot more about the creature that took the boy and I was shocked to know that Elizabeth knows about this thing and was even more knowledgeable than me about it but I did not really put my mind into it and welcomed her in my congregation, she was an energetic parishioner that often participates in the liturgy.

She was the hiking loving type, she loves hiking in the mountains with friends and she's the one to not miss a liturgy before going hiking, a very good and healthy individual that inspires many of my young parishioners to explore nature and not just be stuck in their computer screens, she's very helpful and very active in our parish and she does all this without asking for payment.

I asked her once about why she does this and offered to pay her for her services but she refused and told me that it was reparations for her past life of being involved with the occult, she confesses often and it was a good sign of change

Until one day she came knocking on my house at 8:00 PM asking me to let her in, she was in a panic and I immediately let her in and my wife gave her water and calmed her down, she was breathing heavily and she has a few scratches on her arms and parts of her clothing was ripped by either the branches of whatever that's come after her

We sat her down on the sofa and asked her about what she saw and she told us about a moving tree that is after her, I was puzzled and confused as to why a tree would move and chase her unless she's hallucinating but she swore to me that what she told me is true, I listened to what she has to say.

She told us about walking in the woods as she was on her way home from her hike but the night came fast and it was dark when she was walking alone in the woods, she suddenly saw strange symbols carved on the trees and she felt the feeling of being watched.

She told me about hearing the whisper, "do you think you can turn away from us?" In the wind and she looked around the area, she saw a moving creature with branching arms rushing towards her and she ran as fast as she can.

She ran until she saw the road leading to my house and ran in the direction of my house until she arrived at my house in a panic, we tried our best to comfort her and offered her to rest in our house for the night which she agreed to and in the morning I dropped her off at her house.

One night I received a call from her asking me to go to her house because she was seeing a strange looking creature outside her house, it was pure black as she described and I immediately rushed to my room to get my stuff

I took a gun, a rosary, a bottle of holy water, and a crucifix necklace with me and rushed off to go outside, I told my wife to stay at home with the kids while I go and check on Elizabeth

Her house was a fifteen minute drive from mine but I pushed on the pedal and I arrived there ten minutes after, I noticed that the street light was turned off and her house's door was wide open, I had a bad feeling about it and I reached for my weapon and aimed it at the door as I walk slowly towards it

I called out, "Elizabeth!", A scream from the upper floor was heard and I immediately rushed to it with weapon in hand, I arrived at the scene with a creature in pure black was grabbing a hold of her neck, I shot it in the head from behind and blood spilled from it.

The creature then turned it's face towards me and what I saw was a blank white head with no features, it's branching arms was all over the room and it spoke, "your presence disgust me."

I spoke back, "let go of her."

"What makes you think I will obey a mere human like you? I know your weaknesses and sins, and I can spread it around the world to make you fall" it spat back, "one human for my thirst for blood and flesh and one soul to be damned, can't you priests leave us alone?"

I crossed myself and grabbed a rosary from my pockets and started praying the Hail Mary, in a quick reaction it tried to swat me away but I evaded it quickly, "oh stop! Your prayers annoy me more than your entire kind!" It spoke

"Release her demon" I spoke back to it and it looked at her, it moved it's arms and wrapped around her neck, I quickly used the Holy Water against it and it twitched in agony and pain, I went for the thing and whipped it with the rosary and it let go of Elizabeth, and disappeared.

I quickly went for Elizabeth and held her up, she was unconscious so I carried her off to my truck and drove back to my house but it wasn't gonna be an easy ride like I thought, the creature doesn't give up and tried to take us into disaster

It appeared in the middle of the road in front of us and I immediately stopped, I did the sign of the cross and pushed on the pedal, my truck went off in crazy speed and it disappeared as soon as my truck came near to it.

We arrive home and my wife was worried, we took Elizabeth to the hospital and told them a different story as they wouldn't believe what I saw in her house, the police investigated and concluded that a robber broke into her house and tried to kill her

Elizabeth was on a ten day coma and I anointed her head with oil as the sacrament of anointing the sick, she recovered pretty quickly and started to live with us on our house due to the trauma, until now Elizabeth lives with us and we became like a family to her.

That's all I can tell you right now as I am now heading in head, I'll post more of my experiences in the next coming days but I have to leave it here right now as I am getting sleepy and drained. Good night.
