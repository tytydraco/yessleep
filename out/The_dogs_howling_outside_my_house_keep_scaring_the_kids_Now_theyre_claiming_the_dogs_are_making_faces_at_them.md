I am a single mother taking on the challenge of raising two children in the middle of nowhere. My youngest, Ruby, is 4, and my eldest, Jade, is 7. Sometimes, I feel like our presence isn't enough to fill the two-story farmhouse we live in, surrounded by never-ending fields, pierced by a single road, our connection to the town nearby. I could never leave the property - the family business relies on the farm, and my job is to keep it alive and going.

I did feel stung by fear from time to time, when it came to managing business and my two kids, especially because I had no support from anyone, but time passed and I stopped feeling lonely or insecure.

We had plenty of dogs around the house, some sort of precaution I subconsciously took for me and my girls. I felt like, if anyone were to come near us, the dogs would keep us safe, since they'd be trained to bite, scratch and scare away anyone but the three of us. Their barking was our alarm, but we usually had nothing to worry about apart from animals or friends passing.

We'd just come home from a road trip to my mother's house, and were exhausted. Our car had broken down halfway through the woods and we had to stop at a random couple's house to call for help. By the time we managed to get on the road again, over 6 hours had passed and Ruby and Jade were irritated and tired beyond measure.

I unlocked the door and they sprinted up the stairs. I remained behind them in the doorway, key in hand, taking in the creaking of the house and the humid air. It was 11PM and darkness and coldness had suffocated the building and its hallways, and sometimes I felt uneasy even if I'd practically grown up on that farm.

Something rattled behind me, and I turned around facing the porch and my car, barely visible in the night. I remained waiting, my back straight, until I heard the first rain drops, then I shut the door behind me and locked it.

That night, the rain fell and fell on our rooftop, the wind shook our home to the bone and the walls trembled under the storm. Our dogs howled - their barking was so unnatural, almost fearful, tearing down through their throats, hoarse and desperate. They'd never howled like that.

Ruby and Jade slept in my bed that night.

The storm hadn't done too much damage, and yet it left a looming presence over us. Almost as if we were waiting for another one to finish the job. The next night, as I was tucking Ruby into bed, the silence of the house was pierced by a long howl. We froze, then barking followed, sustained only by one dog.

"Is someone outside?" Ruby muttered, stretching. "Some cat or what?"

"Yeah, probably. It'll shut up soon." I replied, annoyed. I threw a glimpse out the window, and saw nothing.

I went to bed, but the howling continued. I hated those occurrences when one of our dogs decided on a random night to just go nuts at whatever the hell he fixated on. *Shut up, shut up, shut uuuuup.*

I tossed and turned, but the goddamn dog would not stop. Finally, I went downstairs and through the back door, and there he was. One of our dogs, Samson. Barking like a lunatic at... nothing.

"Sams, honey, what are you doing?" I mumbled, searching for anything in the night. "Who's there?"

Samson, stopped barking the minute I opened the door and just stared at me. I thought I couldn't stand his howls, but now the silence triggered me in a different, unexpected way.

He was a tall, lean dog of no particular breed, with dark eyes, sizzling like pieces of charcoal. His quietness surprised me, and I stared into his eyes for a few moments, but sensed no fear. I looked up to the distance, the vastness of the fields, so far away that the kitchen light couldn't reach. The silence was heavy, and Samson was as still as stone, looking straight at me.

I suddenly felt very little, and just wanted to get to my girls, so I stepped back to shut the door. The moment I swung it, Samson leaped towards the entrance of the kitchen, but I'd been faster. I shut it and locked it, hearing his body slam against the other side. Then, he let out a long, hoarse howl. It sounded vulnerable. Human.

I sat there trembling in disbelief. Took a sharp breath, bit my lip, then shook my head and went upstairs, up to the last floor, to my girls' bedroom, and slept on their floor.

I couldn't show them I was afraid of our dog, who was supposed to protect us.

Days passed after that incident and I almost forgot about it. Even though I found myself to stare a bit longer at Samson, he didn't follow up with anything peculiar after that night. I dismissed the whole thing and focused on other problems, since I had plenty to pick from.

I think two weeks had passed after that, when a cold, slippery hand woke me up in the middle of the night. I opened my eyes to greet Jade, on her tiptoes, looking down at me, unsure of what to say. Why was she still on her tiptoes, and whispering? She'd already woken me up, and Ruby was right behind her.

"Mom, the dogs are howling again."

This time, it wasn't just Samson. The howls formed a hoarse, crying mess that bounced off our walls and echoed into the darkness, and it wasn't just annoying, the way you'd throw a shoe at a dog barking at the moon, but plain disturbing. They were desperate, eating into the silence, hungry for screaming, for crying, for mourning. I stood up and rushed to the window. Something had to be around our house, passing, or maybe a burglar had studied our farm for the past weeks and was slowly making his way in. Our home was big, and dark thoughts began racing into my mind - thoughts of shadowy figures looking for my girls, my money, my home.

"They've been howlin' for *days,* mommy," Jade mumbled. "You can't hear them 'cause you're sleeping all the time, but they're there and they won't stop. It's scary. I can't sleep."

I hushed them and told them to sit still in my bed, as I closed the bedroom door and tiptoed to the ground floor. Our dining room had two large sliding glass doors, and at night it felt like our whole wall was missing, and you could see straight into the cornfields. It was moments like these where I was fully aware of how small we were, and how isolated. Around us, acres of land spilled and spilled into the woods, blending into the pitch black sky, and a never-ending darkness surrounded my home. 

What could I even do? Even if someone was trying to break into my house, could I just call the police and tell them that the dogs are barking, without even identifying an intruder?

As I approached the doors, my head spinning, I made out the silhouettes of three out of 8 of my dogs. Among them was Samson, and they were barking like crazy. I slid one of the doors open and, just like the other night, they stopped barking and just stared at me. 

I stared back like a fool, not knowing how to react. Other dogs were still howling around the house, but Samson, Penny and Jack were still, looking at me calmly, their eyes too human, too... tamed. Almost as if they knew something I didn't.

Before I could close the door, Samson let out a low, hoarse growl, and stepped back, then all three of them left. I heard their howls from the left side of the dining room, and I sat and listened for a few seconds, shivering in the cold night and holding onto the glass door like holding onto a lifeline.

I was hoping I'd hear something else, like footsteps, or a voice. Something human, that would justify my animals acting so strange.

I closed the door and locked it, my eyes half closed from the tiredness and my throat dry. I had no idea what to do, and I felt the pressure of my actions as a mother, aware of them affecting my children's lives too.

As I got to the second floor, I noticed my girls had shut all the doors and found them sitting still in my bed, wide-eyed. 

"Are you ok? The dogs are just going crazy at these cats outside. I'm sorry, I know how scary it can feel, but it's all right, I promise. Do you want to watch some TV?"

They didn't answer, but stared at me. I took it as a yes and we eventually fell asleep hurdled together.

The next night, I was awoken again. This time, by Ruby. Her tiny silhouette was shivering from the cold, and her eyes were bloodshot.

"Ruby, are you crying?"

"Mommy, we looked out the window."

"What did you see, honey? Were the dogs being bad again?"

"The dogs were making faces at us."

A long pause followed, where I shifted my gaze from Ruby to Jade, raising my eyebrows. I understood the howling scared them, but I didn't know it had slipped into their dreams, too.

"Did you have a bad dream, Ruby?"

"No, mom," Jade replied, "we heard the barking and I looked outside for the cats, and Sammy and Max were out there, and they raised their head and looked straight at us."

"... Yeah, and their eyes were really wide and..."

"... They were *laughing at us...*"

What I managed to understand from their overlapping descriptions sent a shiver down my spine and my neck tensed up all of a sudden, as my throat began to dry up.

Jade had said the dogs had raised their heads up to look at their window, and their eyes were really wide. Their teeth were bared as if they were smiling, and they looked, um... as Jade said, like "funny masks". Ruby, on the other hand, chose to mimic the face they'd made. She grinned at me, then raised her eyebrows as high as the could, then let her head fall back, lifting her face toward the ceiling. 

"I didn't want them to see me like that, mom. To look at me like that."

I didn't want to alarm them more than I already had, so I told them that it might have been the moonlight hitting weird and that I would check it out.

I followed them to their room and looked out the window but saw... nothing. The ground was bare, and nothing moved outside. Not even the wind.

I barely managed to get them to sleep again. The next day, Samson and Max had gone missing. I went around our yard trying to find them, but to no avail. It was as if they'd never existed, and I never saw them again.

I'd decided to take matters into my own hands - I was going to pull an all-nighter and look out for anything dangerous or weird that would occur outside. My girls' bedroom was facing the fields, while mine, the road, so that night I waited for them to fall asleep, then tiptoed inside and sat still at the window, waiting.

I was sitting on my phone, one headphone in my ear, so as not to wake the girls. After midnight, my neck and legs went numb, and after 1AM, I began to blink mechanically and yawn every other minute. I was about to give up, when I heard a teasing, low howl right under that window. 

I looked down, and what I saw jolted me awake.

Jack was looking straight up, to me. His blue eyes were bloodshot, but I could still see the whites glistening in the moonlight, and he... smiled. His 'smile' looked grotesque, a mockery of our human smile, a grin bearing all teeth, and the skin of his face was stretched to make room for all those teeth, white and sharp, teeth...

That, and he looked... taller. Almost as if he was standing on his hind legs, looking up at me, and grinning.

Panic filled my bloodstream as I couldn't help but sit there, frozen, staring at that awful image that is now engraved onto my brain forever. After what seemed like centuries, I turned to Ruby and Jade, and to my phone, hoping he'd go away. I knew there was no way he could get into the house, and I knew that the next day I would call the police.

When I looked back outside, he'd disappeared. 

The next day, he'd vanished off completely. I'd been left with 5 of my 8 dogs, and I was beginning to fear that the three missing had never truly gone away. I feared they were nearby, waiting. 

I didn't know what they waited for, and I didn't want to give the weird shit that was going around my farm the chance to hurt us. I called the police.

When they came, they looked everywhere. My house, my barn, the stables, the basement, the attic. They had found nothing, and were now looking at me compassionately, as if I was some crazy lady who got spooked by living alone. 

I had nowhere to go and I couldn't leave the farm, so I stayed.

Last night, I was downstairs, playing with Ruby, while Jade was watching TV. Ruby asked for a glass of water, and I went to the kitchen to get one for her. When I came back, I told them that that night, they had to go to sleep earlier. They complained, but I managed to get them upstairs.

"Mommy, why are you sleeping with us here? There's no *room.*"

"I'm just cold. Come on, we'll fit into the bed!"

As I lay with them, my mind raced through the events of the night. How I'd double checked the locks on all doors and windows.

How I'd texted my mother, telling her we'd leave first thing in the morning.

How, when I'd gone to the kitchen to get some water, I'd seen Jack's face outside the window, smiling at me.
