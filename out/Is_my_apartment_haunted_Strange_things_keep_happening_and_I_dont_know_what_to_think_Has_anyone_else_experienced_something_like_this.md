Lately, I’ve been experiencing some really unsettling things in my apartment, and I’m starting to wonder if something paranormal might be going on. For the past few nights, I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night with my heart racing and this overwhelming sense of fear, like something’s watching me. It’s not a normal feeling, and it lingers for a while before I can calm down enough to fall back asleep. I’ve never had issues like this before.

The strangest thing happened yesterday. I know I closed the back door to my apartment before going to bed. I’m certain of it because I have this habit of double-checking all the locks before I go to sleep. But when I woke up, the back door was wide open, and the room was freezing. I don’t mean slightly chilly—I mean *ice cold* like someone left the freezer open. I immediately shut the door, but the whole thing made no sense to me. When I told my parents about it, they weren’t even surprised. They mentioned they’ve seen the door open on its own in the past, even though it should have been locked. And just to clarify, in case anyone is thinking it could’ve been a gust of wind, my lock is an Alrop—look it up. There’s absolutely no way a breeze could have opened it. It’s designed to stay secure.

But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. There’s also this strange thing that happened when I first moved in. I was on a call with a friend while gaming, and out of nowhere, he asked me, “Why does he keep calling your name? Go check on him.” I was confused because no one else was in the house with me, so I asked him what he meant. He insisted that he heard an old man calling my name, and he thought it was my grandpa. But here’s the thing—there was no one else in the apartment, and my grandpa doesn’t live with me. The whole situation left me creeped out, and to make matters worse, I’ve also heard someone calling my name when I’m home alone. It’s usually faint, like it’s coming from another room, but when I go to check, no one is ever there.

As if all that wasn’t strange enough, the street dogs outside my building act really weird too. They howl like crazy almost every night. I’ve lived in places with street dogs before, and this is not normal behavior for them. It’s this constant, frantic barking and howling that goes on for hours, and it always seems to start around the same time, late at night. One time, my dad even went outside with rocks to scare them off because they were being so loud, but it didn’t seem to make much of a difference.

Then there’s the strangest thing of all. One night, I was on the top floor of my apartment building, which has an open roof, just hanging out and talking to the same friend who heard the voice. I was taking pictures of the sky, trying to capture the stars. After I went back inside, I looked through the photos and found one that I definitely didn’t take. The image wasn’t of the sky or stars at all. Instead, it was full of strange lights and colorful orbs, like something out of a ghost-hunting show. I have no idea how that photo got there, and it really freaked me out.

At this point, I’m wondering if all of this is just a series of weird coincidences, or if there’s something more going on in my apartment. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Could this be paranormal, or is there some other explanation I’m not thinking of? I’d love to hear your thoughts or similar stories if anyone has had any experiences like this.
