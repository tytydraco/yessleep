I had an uncle with thirteen fingers. While he was a strange man, I don’t believe he was guilty of the crimes the townspeople later accused him of. In fact, I know with absolute certainty that he was innocent, regardless of what the police and media would later say.

Regardless, I was always afraid to go to his rural mansion when I was growing up nearly twenty years ago. It had dozens of rooms spread out over four floors, and sometimes, the rooms seemed to move around on their own. On the fourth floor, there was one mahogany door in particular at the end of the hallway with a painting of a robin on it that gave me the creeps. The door usually opened onto a small closet, but sometimes when I opened it up, there was a room that looked like it was at least the size of a football field, despite the fact that this was physically impossible based on the dimensions of the house. The fourth floor perimeter would have had to extend hundreds of feet past the other three floors, and yet I knew that, in reality, a massive lawn followed by a never-ending forest of pines and oaks stood beyond this spot.

The secret room was so big that I had never found its far wall; rather, it just faded into darkness. And it wasn’t empty. There was always something in there.

When the room was there, I had gone inside a few times, though never very far. I felt eyes on me and saw the silhouette of something huge and black slithering in the darkness far back in the chamber. The silhouette I saw looked about the height of a tall man, but the way it moved was anything but human.

While I knew my uncle was a wealthy man, the amount of precious stones and metals hidden throughout the room when it did appear was astounding. There were desks after desks covered with ancient-looking leather tomes, some of them in Arabic, Tibetan or Sanskrit, and one time, I swiped a couple rings I found in one of the dusty drawers of the desk closest to the door. My dad looked at them and told me they were nearly pure gold with small diamonds and opals embedded in them. The gold and diamonds alone were worth a large amount, not even taking into account the potential historical value of such antique jewelry.

“Where the hell did you *find* these?” my father asked me, raising one eyebrow. His lined face looked down at me with suspicion. I averted my gaze.

“Someone just dropped them on the sidewalk, I guess. Near Uncle Lawrence’s house.” He stared at me for another few moments, as if trying to read my thoughts, then nodded.

“Well, we’ll ask your uncle if he knows who they might belong to,” my dad said, taking the rings from me. As expected, my uncle had no idea whose they were or where they came from, and my father just ended up keeping them as family heirlooms to pass down to me when I was older.

One time, I had asked my uncle about the mysterious shifting rooms and the one room on the fourth floor in particular, and he just smiled.

“There are more secrets in this house than you could ever imagine, William,” he said to me, rubbing his thirteen-fingered hands over his face and sighing. “You should avoid that room on the fourth floor. There isn’t enough money in the world to convince me to go through that door, and I tell the maids and staff members the same thing.

“I would block it off with a wall if I could, but I doubted it would even work. A handyman I hired once tried putting a padlock and chain around the handle and attaching it to a fastened metal anchor on the wall one time ten years ago. By the next morning, it looked like something had *chewed* through the metal. The broken chain and padlock were hanging off the door, with twisted metal and what looked like teeth marks marring the entire thing. From then on, I just told everyone to avoid it. And that’s what I’m telling *you.* Stay out of there.”

That was all he would tell me. Being just a kid, and a curious one at that, I mostly ignored his warning, though I never went more than ten feet or so inside before running back to the door in a childish panic, as if something would grab my foot from under the desks one time if I stayed inside too long.

We went to visit my uncle during Christmas when I was eleven. Despite all his wealth, my uncle was a very private- and lonely- man. He had never married and never had any children. He lived in this massive mansion surrounded by miles of woods, generally all by himself, except for the staff he would hire to clean, cook or maintain the property. He often seemed sad and would drink himself into a stupor at nights with bottles of Cognac, sitting in his library and study room, sometimes shouting at people that weren’t there or crying himself to sleep at his desk. I wanted to ask him what was wrong on occasion, but when he got in those kinds of moods, I felt somehow afraid of him.

The guest room I stayed in was above his study, and I couldn’t sleep. He usually seemed far worse during the holidays, so my father insisted on bringing me and my mother to spend time with Uncle Lawrence. But I heard him yelling at ghosts or memories from his youth in his study, and personally, laying in bed in the dark staring at the ceiling in the huge lonely suite was giving me the creeps. So I got up from bed, sneaking upstairs in my cartoon pajamas to explore, wondering if the secret room on the fourth floor would be there.

As I sneaked past the room where my father and mother were sleeping, I heard the loud snores of my father which told me he was deeply asleep. He generally shared a few nightcaps with my uncle on the holidays, and had passed out early tonight.

I walked down the long hallway of the fourth floor, past the endless doors on both sides. The carpet had a pattern of vines and ivy that intertwined all the way to the end of the hall, looking almost hypnotizing as it disappeared hundreds of feet in front of me next to the door of the closet where the hidden room liked to appear.

I put my small hand on the bronze handle. It felt almost warm beneath my touch, as if it had an inner life to it. Taking a deep breath, I turned it and opened it up. The endless chamber revealed itself behind the mahogany door, disappearing in shadows far away. A musty, antique smell emanated from the room, along with something harder to identify- a smell like sickness, vomit and copper.

I looked at the old grandfather clock ticking away the seconds at the end of the hallway. My heart was racing, my adrenaline pumping. I felt more nervous than I had the other times I entered, but I didn’t know why.

“Don’t be a baby,” I whispered to myself, walking quickly through the door and looking around.

The room seemed to change slightly every time I entered. Ancient-looking writing desks would be moved around, sofas that looked like they were from the time of Al Capone would be arranged in a line one visit, then pushed against the wall facing each other and covered in sheets on other visits. Someone or something was moving the objects around in the room, but who? My uncle? For some reason, I doubted that.

I went to the nearest desk. I saw leather-bound books covering the desk, stacked neatly in piles, with a couple daggers and some silver goblets behind them. I read the titles of the books quickly, seeing “The Tibetan Book of the Dead,” “The Gospel of Judas,” “The Book of Lies,” “The I Ching”, as well as other more esoteric spiritual or religious texts I had never heard of in my short eleven years on Earth.

“Weird,” I said to myself, lifting the Gospel of Judas from its place on the bottom of the pile and blowing a cloud of gray dust off of it, which got me coughing. Once I had recovered, wiping my teary eyes and trying to ignore my asthma, I looked back down at the tome. “I’ve never heard of this.” My parents had taken me to church my whole life, and I had even read parts of the Bible and all of the Gospels, and I had never heard of such a thing as a Gospel of Judas.

As I flipped through the first few pages, I heard a slamming sound behind me. I jumped, nearly pissing my pants as I spun around. I expected to see some huge monster standing there, grinning at me.

But instead, I realized the door had simply shut behind me. This had never happened before. I ran over, feeling that strange warmth in the handle again as I put my small hand on it. I tried turning it and pulling frantically, but it felt like it had been welded shut. There was absolutely no give, no matter which way I turned the handle or how hard I tried pushing or pulling on it.

Then I heard the slithering sound, and it was much closer than I had ever heard it before. I turned around, raising the large leather-bound book that I still held in my hand up over my head like a weapon, and whispered into the air, “Hello? Is someone there?” No reply came. I heard something wet and slimy running along the hardwood, however, but with all the shadows and the dim lighting, I couldn’t see where it was coming from. I was truly starting to panic by this point.

Then I remembered the dagger next to the piles of books. I sprinted towards the desk where I had picked up the Gospel of Judas, knocking the rest of the books aside in blind fear as I reached for one of the daggers behind it. I had only just grabbed it when I heard something directly behind me.

I turned instantly, raising the Gospel of Judas in my left hand above my head like a shield as I gripped the rubies and emeralds of the dagger’s handle in my right. The weapon felt cold, the stones hurting my soft palms as they dug in deep. But there was nothing behind me.

Then I heard hissing from under the nearest desk. Without the light coming in from the hallway, the room had become darker and harder to see inside, with many spots around the far walls and around the furniture being so dark that I could see nothing at all. But as I squinted and focused, I saw white glowing eyes under the desk, like the eyes of a possum with headlights reflecting off of them- though these were far bigger than any possum or racoon eyes I had ever seen.

Then the hissing grew louder and became a gurgling, choking sound, and something huge began to crawl out. It stood taller and taller, towering over me, looking down with black eyes. Shining scales covered its entire body, and its mouth unhinged like a snake’s, sending out a spray of dozens of worm-like, writhing tentacles that began to unfurl towards me.

I instinctively raised the book in front of my face as the one closest shot out like a whip. It hit the hard leather covering, sending my hand flying back and smashing the edge of the tome into my nose, which immediately began to gush blood all down my face. Now screaming in horror, I began to swing the dagger back and forth in front of my face in a frantic effort to keep those tentacles away. Most of them stood hovering, winding in the air in an S-shape like flying snakes.

One tentacle shot out under my raised arm and, moving faster than my eye could see, hit me right in the gut. I saw only a blur, followed by a burning pain as I felt dozens of tiny teeth bite into my skin, then the tentacle retreated like a slingshot after being fired. It took a circle of my flesh with it, and the pain galvanized me. I stopped screaming, shocked and horrified as I felt a torrent of blood rush down my stomach, then ran forward and plunged the dagger into the bottom of the creature’s mouth with an uppercut motion. I had lost the book somewhere in the fight.

The rest of the tentacles retreated immediately and the thing began to shriek, an ear-splitting noise that almost made me drop my weapon and cover my ears. It sounded more like a machine than an animal- almost like a high-pitched tornado siren. It felt like it would never end.

As it closed its mouth, it ripped the dagger, which was still stuck in its chitinous armor, right out of my hands. With a swift slithering motion, it flew away from me at an incredible pace. I saw it had no legs, but only the body of a snake on its bottom half. It stood upright as it moved, however, its long, crooked arms and razor-like chitinous claws held close to its body as it disappeared into a dark corner of the room.

I wanted to cry, to yell for help, to bust the door down, anything to get out of that room. I knew that evil things lived in there now. Quickly and without thinking, I grabbed the second dagger from the top of the desk. This one had an obsidian handle and a silver blade with an eye engraved into it. Underneath the eye, in small letters, there was a stamp in Latin: “Vincit qui si vincit.” I would later learn the engraving meant, “He conquers who conquers himself.”

Sprinting over to the door, I threw my entire body weight against it. It didn’t give at all. The shock reverberated painfully through my shoulder, traveling up the entire length of my body.

Turning, trembling, I started to walk deeper into the chamber, a small boy with a small dagger fighting unknown eldritch abominations.
