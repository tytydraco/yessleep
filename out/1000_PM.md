I swear to God, I’m not crazy.

I had a normal upbringing. Graduated high school with good grades. Went to college for chemical engineering. Got a job working at a large company with a department focused on crystal growth.

My company promoted me to lead engineer at their branch in the DC area. I was all for the new experience, and I was only a few hours’ drive away from home.

My new job started off well. I moved into my new apartment—new appliances, nice countertops. Life was looking good. Then the noises started.

It began with little noises here and there inside my apartment. Most I attributed to the usual apartment sounds—a slight creak in the walls, doors making noises due to temperature changes.

One night, while I was sitting in my living room, I heard a single knock on my window. It startled me. I got up and looked outside. There was nothing. “Probably just a bird or something,” I thought.

The next night, I heard it again—this time more knocks. I counted four knocks. I got up immediately and peeked out the window. Nothing there. I checked the time—it was 10:00 PM. I was a little freaked out but shook it off and went to bed.

The following night, I was sitting in my living room around 9:00 PM, wondering if the knocks would happen again. I closed my eyes for a brief second when my phone went off. It startled me. I turned it over—it was my mom. She texted asking how I was settling in after the move. I replied, saying everything was fine, just adjusting to the new place and that wonderful DC traffic.

We exchanged texts for a while, and eventually, I stopped thinking about the knocking. All I was filled with in that moment were happy memories back home in Ohio. Then, there it was again—four knocks, a slight pause, and one loud knock. I froze for a second and dropped my phone. I got up from the couch and slowly walked over to the window, uncovering the blinds. Nothing there. I stood in disbelief for a moment, then ran back to my phone. It was 10:01 PM.

I didn’t sleep well that night. I know it’s not some kind of animal—the timing is way too consistent. Maybe it’s some neighbor kid messing with me, or a homeless guy or something.

The next night, I was prepared. I stood a few feet from my window, looking down at my phone: 9:56 PM. My hands were shaking. I both wanted to and didn’t want to see what was outside. 9:57 PM—I felt my chest tighten with anxiety. 9:58 PM—my whole body was shaking. Cool goosebumps ran up and down my arms. 9:59 PM—I stared intensely at the window, ready for what was next.
At 10:00 PM, I heard the knocks. This time they were quicker—nine fast knocks. I lunged toward the window and uncovered the blinds. My heart sank. Nothing. Nobody was out there. I dropped to the floor, my head leaning against the bottom trim of the window. Before I could even process what had happened, four more knocks came. I quickly turned around—still nothing.

At this point, I was in full “F this” mode. I left my apartment carefully looking over my shoulder and got in my car. I drove to a nearby hotel and spent the night there. Lying on the hotel bed, staring at the ceiling, a thought struck me: “Four knocks, four knocks and a single knock. Nine fast knocks followed by four fast knocks. Is it a code or something?” I loaded up ChatGPT and typed in what the knocks could mean if it was a code. At first, it spit out the phrase “Deid.” I didn’t think that was it. I kept asking for more possibilities. Eventually, it came up with “someone outside, knock pattern to identify a friend, or emergency/code.” I asked ChatGPT to elaborate, but it didn’t help.

Morning came. I barely slept again. I had to know what the knocks were. I called in sick to work and drove to Best Buy to buy an outdoor motion light detector camera. I mounted it on a tree facing my window. The rest of the evening, I anxiously paced around my apartment, waiting for the dreaded 10:00 PM.
My clock hit 10:00 PM, followed by the knocks—four knocks. This time they sounded firmer, louder, malicious. I loaded the app tied to my motion camera. No video recorded. Whatever was out there did not trip the motion or light sensor on the camera.

I decided to cut my losses. I packed a bag of essentials and drove back home to Ohio. I called work to cash in a week of personal sick leave. I called my mom and told her I was coming for a while. I wasn’t going to sit in my apartment and play the stereotypical horror movie victim.

It’s about a six-hour drive to Columbus. I drove straight through the night. I knew I was close when the terrain flattened and cornfields popped up everywhere. I pulled into my mom’s house around 5:00 AM and went straight to my old bedroom, passing out immediately.
I woke around noon and came out to the living room. My mom asked worriedly, “What’s wrong? Why are you home?” I kept it brief, sparing the details: “I’m being harassed and needed to get away.” She tried to press, but I didn’t want to give her the details. Saying them out loud made me sound crazy.

I spent the day relaxing around my childhood home. I felt safe here. Night came, and I was lying in bed when I heard a noise that nearly gave me a heart attack—four knocks, a pause, then one knock. It had followed me home. A million thoughts flooded my mind. It knew where my mom and sisters lived. It had followed me 400 miles home. I panicked. I called 911 and told them I needed police ASAP. I ran downstairs and waited for the cruisers. I told them everything—about the harassment, the knocks, being followed. They gave me a “you’re crazy” kind of look but filed a police report and said they’d contact the DC police.

At that moment, I decided I wasn’t going to put my family at risk. I grabbed my essentials, hopped in my car, and drove off. I left my phone behind, just in case they were tracking me through it. I pulled into my childhood friend’s property just outside Dayton and asked for a favor. We swapped cars—he let me park mine in his barn and take one of his beaters he was working on. I didn’t want this thing tracking me. 

From there, I drove west. Eventually, I hit Indianapolis and pulled into a gas station. I asked to borrow the landline and called my mom to explain the situation in more detail, promising to stay in touch with a different phone. She was worried but seemed to understand. Everyone around me must think I’m crazy.

I kept driving and eventually hit Kansas City. It was close to noon. I walked into Walmart and bought five prepaid phones. The cashier probably thought I was some kind of drug dealer. I called my mom to update her and told her I’d be in periodic contact. After the call, I snapped the phone in half and kept driving west.

At night, somewhere in Colorado a couple of hours east of Denver, I heard something that sent me spiraling—nine loud knocks from my back window. I jerked the wheel, and my car spiraled out of control into grassy fields. I started hyperventilating and got out, shouting, “Who are you?!” No answer. “What the fuck do you want from me?!” Still no answer. I collapsed on the ground, not knowing what to do next. Then I heard it again—four knocks from the other side of my car. I ran around. Again, nothing.

After a few moments, I collected myself and got back in the car. I pulled out one of my burner phones and was about to dial 911 when I looked at the number pad. My eyes widened. The number of knocks, put in alphabetical order on a flip phone, spelled “GHZ.” It wasn’t much, but it might be something.

After getting assistance pulling my car out of the field, I drove to Denver. There, I went to a local library and searched what GHZ could mean online. At first, it said hertz or gigahertz. Useless. Then I looked up acronyms: “global hardware zone,” “graphene heat zone,” “green hill zone,” “galactic hyperdrive zone.” I sighed, “Great. Another red herring.”

Months passed. The same thing every night at 10:00 PM—the same sequence of knocks. If I was in some run-down motel in Oregon, the knocks were there. On an overnight train to Vegas, the knocks were there. At one point, I drove out to the outskirts of Albuquerque, walked a mile away from my car. Still, 10:00 PM. Knocks came from miles away, tapping against some rocks.

I’m at the point now where my savings are depleted. I cashed out my 401k. I’m stockpiling guns and ammo. “I will not become a victim,” I keep telling myself. I smuggled my car and weapons across the Canadian border and made my way to a town out in the middle of nowhere called Slave Lake, Alberta. I’m biding my time. I’ve long gone no contact with my family. I’m standing on the banks of Lesser Slave Lake, waiting. For that dreaded time to hit. I wait. 

Eventually, 10:00 PM hits. But this time, it’s different. There are no knocks. I stand there, shocked. I look all around me. “Is this it?” I think. “Is this where it ends?” I’m scanning the area when I see a man in the distance, wearing a dark hooded cloak. He’s looking in my direction. I yell, “Who the fuck are you?” No response. I grip my gun and point it at him, hands trembling. This is it.

The man starts walking toward me. It’s so dark I can’t make out his face—just blank. As he gets closer, his frame becomes clearer. He’s unnaturally short—can’t be taller than four feet. His head is disproportionately large compared to his body. He stops no more than 10 feet away. I look at his hands. He’s wearing clean white gloves. His shoes are blood red. I drop my gun and collapse to my knees. This thing is not human. I’m ready for it to take me. He looks at me, battered and mentally broken on the ground. He shuffles his arms, and his cloak drops. My mouth drops. What I see is not human.

Standing in front of me is Sonic the Hedgehog.
Sonic looks at me with intensity. “I need your help,” he says.
My mouth, still wide open, can’t get any words out.

“Doctor Robotnik has gotten ahold of one of the Chaos Emeralds. He’s hell-bent on using it for world domination. I need your help.”
