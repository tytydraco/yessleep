Everything happened without warning. I walked into the fitting room, holding that silk dress—an off-season clearance sale, surprisingly beautiful dress—I would never love dresses again in my life. As I started to take off my sweater, the rustling noise was mingled with screams, which were too loud even for a Thursday evening at the mall.

I just wanted to crack open the fitting room door to see what was happening outside. The moment I unlocked the door, that guy rushed in, and it felt like... he slammed me against the wall? I wasn't sure. My whole body hurt too much to tell.

I know I'm not a good person, but I certainly don't deserve to end up like this.

The sticky blood made it nearly impossible to press down on my thigh, and I could only pray that the main artery hadn't been hit. There was so much blood, and I couldn't tell how much was mine and how much belonged to the lunatic next to me... I really hoped he was dead.

I couldn't feel the pain from the stab, maybe due to the blood loss or the adrenaline, and I even had the presence of mind to feel sorry for my pants—expensive blue and white patchwork jeans that I'd only worn twice.

Damn it, that psycho wasn't dead. He looked even more energetic than me. In the mirror of the fitting room, I saw the man grab the knife that had fallen to the floor, his eyes seemingly glowing red, like the red-eye effect in old film photos. He approached me, muttering some short, garbled words, his voice shredded by the bubbling blood in his throat. I couldn't make out if it was English or Chinese.

Fuck.

Before everything went completely black, I reached out to him, determined to make sure he was dead before he could do anything else.

"Did I say that at the time? Sorry, I wasn't quite myself then and I used some bad language."

As I scribbled my name—Dai Li—in wobbly letters on the line, I apologized. But honestly, I felt that under the circumstances, a few swear words were understandable.

"It's okay, Miss... D..." Officer Dell, stern but sympathetic, couldn't quite read the surname of the girl who had just been on the brink of death. "How are you feeling now?"

I almost habitually pulled out my passport to prove it was my real name. "I'm okay, the wound hurts a bit, which is normal. If you don't want to say my last name, you can call me Li, or Liv—that's my Starbucks name."

The policewoman visibly relaxed, her voice soothing as if she were comforting a child. "Liv, while you were unconscious, we contacted your mother..."

"She already has a new family. I don't want to bother her with these minor issues."

Thinking of the increasing numbers in my bank account and the message "Take care of yourself," my mood even lifted a bit.

"Did I cause any trouble that requires a guardian's involvement?"

"No, of course not!" Officer Dell quickly denied it, afraid to scare the only survivor. "I assure you, you're not in any trouble. I just want to confirm some details with you if you can remember."

It was time to show fear and confusion. I recalled the differential equation from high school that had caused me to fail an exam and feel like an idiot.

"Uh? Oh... I'll do my best to answer your questions."

Just waking up from an unknown length of coma made my voice naturally dry, which helped express emotion. The anesthesia made it hard to focus, affecting my thinking ability.

But the most perfect deception contains no lies. I was eager to face the most thrilling challenge of my life.

"Can you remember where all this happened?"

My anesthesia-addled brain creaked into motion, memories slowly resurfacing. This part didn't need embellishment. I tried to sort out the timeline from the jumbled mess of my memory. "I think... I was at the mall. There was no class that day. When was it... Thursday, right?"

"Don't worry, take a deep breath. You don't need to force yourself." Officer Dell poured a cup of ice water, placing a straw to my lips. "This isn't a formal interrogation. If you feel uncomfortable, we can stop at any time."

"I'm fine. Remembering it once is bad enough."

"Alright, alright, just some routine questions—do you remember where exactly the attack happened?"

I managed to sip some water, finally making talking less painful. "Mirrors... there were mirrors all around, a fitting room? I'm not sure."

Actually, I remembered it all too clearly.

The heavy smell of blood instantly enveloped me, and a twisted face suddenly appeared in the crack of the door. That face, contorted like a frenzied wild animal, was almost unrecognizable, covered in a sticky, rancid pink liquid.

Unfortunately, I could tell it was a mix of blood, saliva, and sweat from someone with poor hygiene who hadn't bathed in at least a week.

"It's okay, don't force yourself. What did the attacker do?"

My breathing quickened, fingers spasming, voice hoarse and sharp. "He... he lunged at me like lightning, trying to tear me apart!"

That disgusting mess didn't use a knife initially but tucked the blood-stained dagger into his waistband, grabbed my neck, and pressed me against the mirror. It's strange—both his actions and my ability to think in such a situation.

"And you?"

"I... I... fought back! He got hurt!"

Fortunately, this country rarely has a "excessive self-defense" charge, especially when facing a knife-wielding, blood-soaked maniac. Asphyxiation made my face look dreadful, not needing any acting. Using the remaining strength, I pulled out the wooden hairpin, stabbing it accurately into the nearest eye.

Oh, I seemed to have pushed the 13-centimeter round-headed stick—the kind allowed on planes—deeper, stirring it in the gooey hole like fishing out aloe chunks from a bubble tea.

As he let go of my neck to cover his right eye, I knelt on the ground, gasping for air, never realizing the mall's air could be so sweet—pure instinct. Rationality stopped me from indulging in the delightful oxygen and grabbed the belt at my waist.

In hindsight, it's a bit embarrassing, but I really just wanted to grab the knife tucked at his lower back.

Then I and the blood-covered, foul-breathed lunatic rolled into a tussle.

Damn, I should have worked out more.

"Yes, he was injured. You defended yourself well. Do you remember any other details?"

Next came the exhilarating performance. I imagined a swarm of tarantulas crawling up the sheets and IV tubes, onto my body, into my mouth, screaming as I tried to shake off the furry little monsters.

Genuine emotions are the key to captivating an audience. I was so engrossed in my performance, unaware of how the frantic beeping beside me alarmed the poor, diligent officer until the nurse pressed the cold liquid into my vein, consciousness fading back into darkness.

God bless, I hope this unknown officer doesn't get into trouble because of this. I just need to pretend to be normal.
