Music is, and has been my life. It's been my escape. It's been there for me through my pains, sorrows, victories, and so much more. Listening to music- and making music (a new hobby of mine) is a huge creative outlet for me. It's fun and occupies my thoughts. The lyrics I write and then turn into a song- that's my way of feeling. That's my way of coping. And it may not be healthy, but my mental health isn't what I'm writing this about, right now. And I don't have enough time to delve into that stuff.

While scrolling through my music app, looking for new mixes and shit, I came across a new playlist, or compilation. My most listened to of 2024. It being the new year, I was and had been curious. The top songs weren't surprising to me, being my own personal favourites along with songs that calmed me, or songs I screamed my lungs out to.

But at the bottom, hiding inconspicuously between other tracks, was one song I can't recall ever listening to. It's name was ''I'm here'', and the artist name was blank. I'm not even kidding- the band, or artist, or whoever sung/produced this song called themselves blank. Pretty weird, right? Well, it didn't stop there.

At first, I thought this was some unknown singer who somehow hacked themself into my most listened to, to boost their song, or something? I, too, was dubious about this. Stupid way of thinking and all, but I was still curious. I went to the artists bio, expecting nothing. The bio was empty, but something caught my attention. And brought chills all down my spine.

This mystery person- whoever they were- had a profile picture. And it wasn't normal, as it was legitimately MY house. At this point, I was freaking out. Confused and scared, I screenshotted it and went to my gallery, only for my whole phone to crash and shut down. It must've died. I charged it immediately, and the moment it turned back on, I checked the artist again, but, the search couldn't find it. 

Trying to calm myself, I convinced myself it was a glitch. I went through my most listened to, but I didn't find it. It was nowhere to be found, so naturally I took to the Internet. No information.

It was pretty late, so I assumed hesitantly that I'd made it up due to lack of sleep or anxiety, which I had a lot of. Feeling a bit restless, I decided to turn on my headphones and soothe myself with the familiar and calming videos I listened to often. My favorite YouTubers screaming over horror games! It was a bad idea, since, y'know, this creepy ass shit happened to me. I did it anyway, and was almost about to fall asleep until a stupid ad burst through my headphone speakers, startling me into awareness. 

Annoyed, I turned over and grabbed my phone, getting ready to skip the ad until- 

"Do you feel like you're being watched? Feel unsafe in your own home?" A cliched, enthusiastic man said through my headphones. Typical ad. Promising and guaranteeing pointless shit. I was getting really tired, so decided to close the app and turn my phone off. 

After closing YouTube, the voice was STILL loudly going in my ears. What the heck? This was getting more annoying than it was weird. I listened anyway, because, y'know, I was curious! I wish I hadn't been.

"Well, if you are, we have the perfect product for you! It'll watch, er, observe and protect you through your sleep, just don't tell the Government!"

Did this thing know I'd been trying to sleep? What the hell?

"Don't be scared, now! This is Project Blank, and we're here for you!"

Wait.. that sounded a bit.. familiar. Project Blank? Like, that blank? The mysterious artist? And the song called I'm here? Speaking of, that suddenly reminded me then to check my screenshots. Surely the screencap I'd gotten would be there. I wasn't crazy. But, as you've probably already guessed, there was nothing there. Except for something in my camera roll. 

With the ad STILL going off in the background, I locked in, focusing on the photo. I didn't remember taking any photos recently, so I tapped on the photo. It was just a black background, with what seemed to be a link in the center. Small, but still readable. But whatever the hell was going on, was anyone really dumb enough to go to a shady-ass link? I certainly wasn't. Just to be safe, I ignored the ad and shut down my phone. 

Sighing, I fell asleep easily afterwards, and besides a bad dream or two (which is quite normal for me), I slept fairly well. Especially considering what had 'happened' last night. I put that in quotes, because I'm probably just crazy and hallucinating.

When I awoke, I got dressed, brushed my teeth and did my morning routine. I'd completely forgotten about the events of last night, grabbing my headphones and turning on my favorite playlist while doing chores around the house. After a while,man unfamiliar song started playing. Weird. Maybe I'd reached the end of the playlist and it was playing recommended tracks.

I let it play, as the beggining was interesting. It sounded like footsteps accompanied by a light guitar, plucking offbeat with a slight fuzzy sound. The song was like this for a few more seconds before it changed. The footsteps became louder- so loud I could've sworn they were right behind me. Then, the sound of a doorknob turning in the 'song'- if that's what you could even call it- creeped me out, so I closed it. 

Then, I heard a knock. Oh hell no. No. Nope. I turned my headphones off, holding my phone close to my chest. Then the music started playing again, in sync with an unfamiliar voice behind the door.

"I'm here."

I'm writing this while hiding in my closet. I've dialed 9-1-1 and explained that there was an intruder. But the music is getting louder and louder. I hate this music. I swear the noise will give away my hiding spot- considering blank can (or hasn't already?) come inside of my house.

The lyrics of the song have been eerie. They keep saying 'listen to the music'. It sounds like a fucking cult. So, to whomever is reading this. Please, be wary. You never know when music can turn on you.
