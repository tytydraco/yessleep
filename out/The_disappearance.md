There was a young man who suddenly gets adamant on sleeping on the terrace of his house. This goes on for months but his family starts noticing that as days progress, he's going on to the terrace a bit earlier each day.

It had started of where he would go up to the terrace when it was time to sleep but progressed to the point where as soon as he would go up right after sunset and not be seen until morning. His family asked him why he prefers going to the terrace and he just gives a vague answer about wanting some time to himself to clear his head from the work tension and all.

Anyways, time passes and one day right after sunset, the young man goes to the terrace as per norm. His mom has made his favorite sweet dish and asks his sister to give a bowl to him on the terrace. The sister goes up to the terrace and hears her brother talking with someone. She only hears her brother's voice; doesn't hear anyone else. It's also some romantic talk. The usual that couples talk about when they're in a new relationship.

The sister doesn't want to overstep by hearing her brother's personal conversations but is also curious as it looks like her brother got himself a love interest. She thinks he's talking to someone on the phone so her idea is to catch him on the act and tease him about it. Siblings love! So the sister suddenly enters the terrace and sees that her brother is just staring up at the night sky. She clearly sees the phone away from him.

She asks him who he was talking to and he says no one. He must have been just talking to himself to clear his head. The sister knows what she heard but can't tell her brother that she was eavesdropping and heard some romantic conversation. She lets it be. However, in the coming days whenever another member of the family went to the terrace unannounced, they would hear this guy talking but also only hear his voice and see that there's no one there. Everytime when asked, he would be adamant that he's not talking to anyone.

Come one morning, everyone is at the breakfast table and this guy won't come down. When it's late the sister goes to the terrace to check on him but sees that the terrace is empty. There is no one there. The house is locked from the inside so the family members figure out that he didn't leave from the front door. Did he get abducted by someone climbing on to the roof in the night? The terrace is pretty high so he couldn't have jumped of, even if he wanted to for whatever reasons.

Police are involved, hospitals are put on alert. But there is no trace of the young man. No one has seen him, no one knows where he is. He's just vanished. A couple of months after the disappearance, a neighbor comes in to speak with the household. He says he saw something the night when the boy disappeared. It looked odd so he didn't want to tell everyone then but given that a few months has passed since his disappearance, it's only right he shares the information with them now.

So the neighbour says that in his home, from his washroom window, he could clearly see the terrace of this house where the young man lived. The neighbor wakes up before sunrise for his work and for quiet some time, whenever he woke up and went to the washroom to get ready, he used to see the young man talking excitedly. He could see the young man moving his hands while talking, could see him smile, could see him laugh. Problem was that he was doing it all by himself. There was no one else on the terrace with the young man. 

The night of the disappearance, the neighbor woke up as usual and when he went to the washroom, he noticed that the young man looked nervous. He was fidgeting. Obviously, this is someone seeing a terrace from his washroom window, so at that time he didn't realise it was fidgeting or that the young man was nervous and dismissed it as something else. But then suddenly, a bright light appeared and he saw apparation of 2-3 women on the edge of the roof. 

He remembers seeing fear in the young man then but they quickly grabbed him and disappeared as soon as they had appeared. The next second, the terrace was empty.

Now the first thing that the family of the young man thought was that this neighbour had something to do with the young man's disappearance and was just covering his tracks now by making this story. They reported the neighbor to the police who arrested the man. But obviously, nothing came out of it and they had to release him.

The relatives of this household then asked them to not believe the neighbour but atleast consult with a religious scholar to make sure that they've covered all bases. So they did that. The religious scholar listened to the habits of the young man going up to the terrace right after sunset, how his family members heard him speaking when there was no one and then finally what the neighbor saw. The religious scholar was convinced that a female djinn had fallen in love with him. The young man had reciprocated and there was no doubt in his mind that she had taken him.

His sister who first heard him talking with someone is now about 30 years old and she is the one who narrated the story. 20 years have passed since that incident. And there has been no sign of her brother as if he never existed in the first place!!!
