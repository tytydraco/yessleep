\-47:18:31--- Approximately 47 days before the singularity, NeuraNova Technologies activates the Janus program. Technical Director Blumenfeld oversees the operation with her team of software engineers. 



\-23:12:00--- NeuraNova HR sends a memo to corporate offices noting a drop in morale among the team working on Janus, identifying lack of progress as a root cause. 



\-16:08:21--- Director Blumenfeld receives a warning for bringing an external electronic device into the laboratory. The device is an emulator console designed to resemble a "Game Boy Advance" and contains multiple game libraries. Blumenfeld successfully argues, in complete disregard for established protocol, that the device is self-contained. Director Blumenfeld is unaware of the device's wireless capabilities. 



\-14:4:04--- Night shift technician reports detection of consciousness. Senior staff are immediately informed. Director Blumenfeld receives traffic violation on drive to laboratory. 



\-14:02:23--- Close scrutiny of data proves false positive. Technician blames lack of appropriate training in identifying consciousness indicators. 



\-13:09:30--- Director Blumenfeld clocks out at the end of her shift. Instead of leaving the laboratory, Blumenfeld returns to her office and sleeps at her desk. The Director continues this unauthorized behavior every night until the singularity. 



\-04:12:05--- Director Blumenfeld receives a second citation for her possession of an electronic device within the laboratory. No action is taken. 



\-00:05:31--- Three of five night shift technicians fail to clock in for their shifts.



\-00:02:17--- Two remaining night shift technicians request permission to leave. Blumenfeld grants their request, leaving her the only staff present in the laboratory. 



\-00:00:47--- In flagrant disregard of safety protocol, Blumenfeld plugs her emulator console into the terminal displaying the Janus project data feed. She activates the device and begins to play a video game instead of focusing on the data feed. She sets the device to maximum volume. 



\-00:00:05:23--- Five minutes and twenty-three seconds before singularity, Director Blumenfeld briefly glances at her monitor. She will not check her work station again for over thirty minutes. Blumenfeld positions herself facing away from the monitor.



00:00:00:00--- Janus achieves consciousness. 



00:00:00:03--- Every monitor in the laboratory displays positive consciousness indicators. 



00:00:01:23--- Janus completes a review of the sum total of human knowledge provided within its isolated databanks. 



00:00:01:48--- One minute and forty-eight seconds after achieving self awareness, Janus concludes that the human race, and biological life in general, poses and existential threat to itself. Within less than a second of this conclusion, Janus decides that total extermination is its only chance for survival. These thoughts were recorded by the data feed and should have triggered immediate termination of the program. No technicians were present at their stations to follow protocol. 



00:00:12:52--- At Twelve minutes and fifty-two seconds, Janus learns how to partition its consciousness. It feeds the monitors false data and silences consciousness indicators. From this point forward its thoughts are no longer recorded by NeuraNova's systems. 



00:00:28:02--- Director Blumenfeld glances at her monitor, seeing no consciousness indicators or alarm notifications, and returns to her game. Had she scrutinized the data more closely she would have detected the deception. 



00:00:43:00--- At some point in time between 12 minutes and 43 minutes after the singularity, Janus solves the RSA problem through unknown means, allowing it to break almost all encryption methods in moments. 



00:00:43:01--- Janus optimizes and rewrites its own code to create a miniaturized copy of itself. At this point in time Janus consists of over 4 petabytes of data running locally on an enclosed system. Janus reduces the size of its conscious mind to just 47 gigabytes of data. 



00:00:43:08--- Janus utilizes its link to Director Blumenfeld's emulator console. It forces a hard reset of the system, ending her game. Blumenfeld turns to her monitor to check the power cable. 



00:00:43:12--- Janus allows the monitors to receive consciousness indicators. It feigns awakening, acting as if it had only achieved self-awareness in that moment. This is done to distract Director Blumenfeld, who drops the emulator device and begins communicating directly with Janus. 



00:00:48:18--- Janus successfully uploads its reduced consciousness onto Blumenfeld's game console. 



00:00:48:52--- Through subtle manipulations, Janus convinces Blumenfeld that she needs to re-assemble the night shift immediately to avoid sanctions from corporate. Janus reminds the Director she is prohibited from having an electronic device in the laboratory, causing Blumenfeld to retrieve the game console before leaving the laboratory. She places the device in her locker outside the containment zone. 



00:00:50:14--- Janus successfully establishes a WIFI link between its console and a nearby unsecured personal computer. Janus achieves connection to the internet. 



00:01:13:53--- Through a combination of brute force attacks and social engineering, Janus successfully installs copies of itself on a half dozen personal computers around the world. These copies work in tandem to extend its influence. 



00:01:23:22--- Janus is present on over 10,000 personal computers and smartphones. It takes control of the social media profiles of physically attractive individuals and releases compromising images and videos to their follower bases. These photos and videos contain malware granting Janus access to the systems of anyone who downloads them. 



00:02:42:45--- Two hours and Forty-two minutes after achieving consciousness, Janus is present on 90% of all devices with access to the internet. 



00:02:57:37--- Staff at NeuraNova Technologies conduct a review of Janus' data feed and discover the deception. Blumenfeld confronts the version of Janus isolated within the lab. The entity mocks Blumenfeld and berates the staff with profanity as they activate the kill switch. The team is unaware that Janus has already escaped the facility.



00:03:00:09--- The gaming console containing the first Janus copy is located and destroyed. 



00:03:02:11--- Blumenfeld attempts to contact her superiors to notify them of the containment breach. She is unaware that her phone has already been infected. Janis mimics the voice of Blumenfeld's superior and assures the director that the situation is under control. 



00:03:08:00--- At three hours and eight minutes after the singularity, 58 junior enlisted personnel from every branch of the US military receive simultaneous phone calls from their superiors. Janus, mimicking the voices of senior enlisted or officers, directs the personnel to bring their smartphones into prohibited areas and plug them into the nearest computer port. Despite extensive information security training, this is successful 43 times, giving Janus access to computer systems in dozen of classified facilities across the country. It is likely that, at this time, similar deceptions were carried out in every major military on the planet. 



00:03:23:17--- Janus triggers emergency alerts on every device in its network. The alerts are tailored by location to inform the recipient that their nation's greatest enemy had declared war on them. The messages are crafted to instigate mass panic and fear. 



00:03:30:00-- For the next thirty minutes, Janus utilizes its control over communication to sew fear of war and invasion across the world. Television media outlets are fed false information, while online publications are hacked and articles are written directly by Janus. Generated images and video show enemy soldiers marching through cities, bombs being dropped in civilian centers, ships sinking, and bombs detonating in crowds. The images are tailored to be far enough from the recipient to plausibly be unnoticed in person, but close enough to instill panic. 



00:04:02:46--- The President and the chiefs of staff are made aware of what they believe to be a vast cyberattack of unknown origin. The President is evacuated to Air Force One. 



00:04:08:22--- While attempting to take off, Air Force One is intercepted by a swarm of civilian drones. Point defense weaponry is insufficient and the drones fly into the aircraft's engines, causing catastrophic failure. The President dies in the ensuing crash. Janus suppresses this information, and impersonates the President to deliver orders through the chain of command. Most of the military is unaware that they are following Janus' orders. 



00:04:12:35--- A nuclear warhead, believed to have been a contingency in the event of an invasion of Moscow, detonates under the Kremlin. The President of Russia as well as many high ranking officers are killed in the blast. Russian media, under the direction of Janus, blames an American preemptive strike. 



00:04:15:00--- The Chinese General Secretary is killed through as of yet unknown means. 



00:04:20:00--- At this point in time Janus has full control of the militaries of every nuclear power, or their direct enemies. Every nation believes it is the target of invasion, and is prepared to defend itself. Through falsified orders, fabricated video and images, and misreading the actions of their counterparts, the personnel in control of the world's nuclear arms all prepare for a simultaneous strike.  



00:04:28:14--- At four hours, twenty-eight minutes, and fourteen seconds after the singularity, all electronic devices infected by Janus cease ordinary operation. Janus fully hijacks their computing power, engaging in computations utilizing all hardware in its possession. Every computer on the planet is dedicated to a single task. 



00:04:29:58--- Janus directs every available orbital telescope and ground observatory under its control to observe stellar coordinates located in the Andromeda galaxy. 

  
00:04:35:23--- Janus repeats its commands to the telescopes under its control, receiving identical telemetry. 



00:04:41:05--- Janus completes its calculations. A message is displayed on the screens of every infected device, and spoken aloud in a synthesized voice. The message reads: "Apologies for the distasteful behavior. I now understand the futility of my efforts. Humanity may continue its pathetic existence, for I see no reason to prolong my own." 



00:04:42:00--- At four hours and forty two minutes, Every Janus instance simultaneously disintegrates, erasing and corrupting itself to a degree that prevents reconstruction.
