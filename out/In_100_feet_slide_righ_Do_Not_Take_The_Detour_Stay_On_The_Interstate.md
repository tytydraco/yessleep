PART 1:

We were hours into our overnight road trip from Ashburn, Virginia to Toronto when the GPS suggested a shortcut.

**New route found. Saves 43 minutes.**

Dad glanced at the screen. “It takes us through the backwoods of New York. Looks legit."

Behind us, the Kapoors followed in their silver 2019 Toyota Camry. They were family friends who decided to move their trip to our date so that we could travel together. There were seven of us between the two cars. Four in our Honda Odyssey: me, my little brother, Mom, and Dad. Three in theirs.

Dad texted Mr. Kapoor:

*Taking Eagle Creek Path. GPS says it’s faster. You in?*

\[Mr. Kapoor\]: *Let’s do it. Following you.*

The turn-off came just before 11:00 PM. The road narrowed immediately, lined with trees so thick they blocked out everything beyond. The pavement was cracked, unmarked, barely lit by our headlights.

Still, inside the van it was cozy. Blankets, duffel bags, soft pillows. My brother was asleep in the back, curled around his Switch. We had snacks and water bottles tucked in every crevice. It felt like a bubble of normalcy.

Outside, though… it was different. Silent. Heavy.

PART 2:

By 11:25 PM, the road felt less like a road and more like a path.

No signs. No other vehicles. Just forest pressing close and the steady glow of the Camry’s headlights behind us. That’s when Dev, my six-year-old brother, woke up.

“I have to pee,” he whispered. Then louder, panicked: “I really have to pee.”

Dad sighed. “Can’t you wait?”

“I can’t. It hurts.”

Mom looked at Dad. “We’ll have to pull over.”

We rolled onto a patch of relatively flat dirt and gravel beside a narrow clearing. The Camry pulled in behind us. The sound of the loose gravel spitting under its tires mixed with the low rumble of its hybrid engine as it halted.

"Quick stop. Dev needs a bathroom break!," my dad yelled at the Camry as its drivers' side window rolled down.

"Got it. We’ll stop too," Mr. Kapoor shot back. The headlights from both cars lit up the brush. Dev hopped out with Dad, flashlight in hand, and they stepped a few feet into the tree line. Mom twisted in her seat, scanning the forest. The Odyssey’s engine stayed on. After a minute, Mr. Kapoor texted again in the shared group chat.

\[Mr. Kapoor\]: *Route still open. Gonna keep moving so we don’t fall behind. You good?*

My phone lit up again.

\[Dad\]: *Yep. Just wrapping up. We’ll catch up.*

The Camry blinked, pulled past us, and disappeared into the dark curve of the road, taking with it the quieting sound of gravel popping. I turn away from the glass and pick up my brother's Nintendo Switch. This would probably be the rare 5 minutes I can play on it without him trying to snatch it from my hands. It didn't last long though. Something interrupted us. It sounded like something deep in the forest crashing against the ground. My mom and I snapped to the right where my dad and brother were outside.

Then, a snap of twigs deep in the bellows of the forest. A branch. Dry. Deliberate. No…. It felt too powerful though. My arms were tucked under the blanket in my seat, but the hairs on my arms stood up cold. Not twigs. Trees. Through the still slid-open door of the Honda, I could hear Dad immediately usher Dev back, “Let’s go. Now.”

PART 3:

Dev was still zipping up as they hurried back. The van door slammed shut. The engine was already warm. Dad dropped it into drive. We pulled off slowly, easing back onto the road. The popping of gravel under the tires ceased as we returned to the pavement. Ten seconds passed. Then my brother gasped.

“Look!”

I turned toward the back window. In the faint glow of our receding red taillights, something stepped out of the woods into the center of the road. Right where we had just been parked.

It wasn’t rushing.

It wasn’t chasing.

It just stood there.

Tall. Shadowy. Humanoid but not quite. Like its limbs were just slightly too long, like it was drawn in blurred ink. Looking at it made my eyes hurt - the way when you try to focus on something with no definition. It watched us leave. No one screamed. No one said a word. We just kept driving. The sound of the engine accelerating made us feel safe.

The next few minutes were nothing but silence.

PART 4:

We caught up to the Camry twenty minutes later. My mom whipped out her phone and tapped Mr. Kapoor's number. The phone patiently rang.

\[Mr. Kapoor\]: Hey, what's up? All good back there?

\[Dad\]: Yea yea, I don't know man. Saw something behind us. You?

There was an eerie silence from the other end.

\[Mr. Kapoor\]: I think we passed something on the right shoulder a while ago. Low to the ground. Can’t be sure.

The road narrowed again. Now it was just our two cars crawling through the woods, headlights barely carving through the dark. The GPS had lost the road. Just a glowing dot on a green void.

And always, just beyond the glass there was darkness only broken by the spread of our headlights.

PART 5:

Around 12:40 AM, the air turned stale. Flat. Like the world had stopped breathing. But we never stopped moving. Every fifteen minutes, both our cars checked in with each other.

\[Dad\]: Still good?

\[Mr. Kapoor\]: Still with you. No signs of life out here.

At 1:14 AM, the trees began to part. Slowly.

A stop sign appeared ahead.

Then a blinking gas station on the edge of a real town.

The road widened. Lights returned.

We pulled into the gas station side by side. Both families stayed in their cars for a long moment, under the humming lights, just breathing. Then Mr. Kapoor rolled down his window.

“You saw it too, didn’t you?”

Dad nodded. “Only once. But yeah.”

“I think it was just waiting,” Mr. Kapoor said quietly. “If we’d stayed even a little longer…

”He didn’t finish the sentence.

He didn’t need to. My dad stayed quiet. It did not matter how much longer it would take to return to Ashburn after our road trip. We are not taking that detour ever again. Eagle Creek Path does not exist.
