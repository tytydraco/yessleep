Roger said I was his melody once. His song. His muse.

The first day I walked into that office, I felt his gaze like the warmth of sunlight on my skin. He introduced himself, his voice deep and smooth, the faintest hint of a stammer that made him seem endearingly vulnerable.

“*I know talent when I see it,*” he told me during our first meeting, his hand lingering just a second too long on mine. “Y*ou’re brilliant, Mary. The whole team’s going to love you.*”

But it wasn’t the team he cared about. **It was me.**

He promised me the world. Late nights in his office turned into stolen weekends at boutique hotels.

“*Forget her*,” he said once, his voice low, his lips brushing against my ear. “*Willa and I…we’re done. You’re all I see now. You’re beautiful, Mary.* ***So beautiful.***”

It had been years since anyone called me that. The reflection I avoided in mirrors was of a tired, middle-aged woman, softened by stress and the comfort of too many meals alone. But when Roger looked at me, I felt radiant, desired.

For a while, it was enough.

Until his trip to India.

Priyam was fire to my quiet warmth—bold, young, with a sharp tongue and a presence that demanded attention. Roger was entranced. I tried to tell myself it was just admiration, that she was simply another talented hire.

But the looks lingered. The laughter between them was too intimate. And then came this audio I heard of him and Priyam one late night.

“*I’m nothing like her!*” Priyam said in a sing-song way, her voice almost challenging and yet seductive . “*That explains why she is your favorite, you always take her side...*”

“***No!***” Roger’s voice was frantic, pleading. “*You’re wrong. Priyam, you’re everything to me. She’s…nothing. A mistake. You’re the one I want.*”

Her silence was cutting, and when she finally spoke, her words dripped with venom. “*Then prove it, Rog*”. That's what I used to call him when we were still sleeping with each other, his face so radiant after the evening ends with a kiss.

Roger began to change. The late-night texts stopped. He became distant, cold. At first, I thought it was guilt or work pressure. But then the videos and pictures of the company event in India began to surface on people's social media, his hand on her back, his gaze locked on hers like she was the only person in the room. That's the same look he gives me after he's made love to me. That's the look of wanting more.

Priyam looks so innocent. A smile hidden by her gorgeous black silky hair and her baby pink trademark colored clothes, but with a knowing smirk tugged at her lips. She leaned closer to Roger, whispering something that made him laugh.

Weeks passed, and I spiraled. I wasn’t beautiful anymore; I wasn’t his melody. I was just *there*. Priyam played the victim to perfection, pulling him in and pushing him away as it suited her.

One week, she’d go on leave, disappear, refusing his calls, leaving him desperate and unhinged. The next, she’d return, her pout turning into a triumphant smirk as he dropped everything for her.

“*Why do you always take her side?*” I overheard Priyam during one of their spats. “*You’re supposed to love* ***me!*** *I'm supposed to be your favorite and not her, why is she even still allowed to work from home?!*”

“*I want you,*” Roger said, his voice breaking. “***I’ll do anything to keep you, Priyam. Anything.***”

I tried to talk to him once, to remind him of what we had. He looked at me like I was a stranger.

“*We're not going anywhere, Mary,*” he said, his tone dismissive. “Y*ou need to move on.*”

“*Move on to what?*” I snapped. “*You promised me, Roger. You said I was beautiful. That I was your melody!*” He just walked away and quietly told me things needed to end, like I was nothing, no one. He didn't make his life with Priyam that big of a secret. Priyam got the best projects, best schedules, and he was like a rabid dog protecting Priyam from anyone else. Meanwhile, he missed meetings and important client discussions because Priyam needed attention. 

The emails from "The Stranger" began not long after that.

The first was a photo of Priyam’s face, laughing as Roger kissed her cheek. Then came the recordings—their whispered conversations, his promises to her, her triumphant laughter.

“*She’s pathetic,*” Priyam said in one. *“I don't care that she was your favorite, Rog, but make it clear to her that* ***I am your queen.***”

“*Forget her,*” Roger replied. “*She’s nobody.*”

Then, more videos came. The Stranger never identified who he was. Was it Christian? Was it Priyam herself? I don't understand who was taking all this. But "The Stranger" left me no note, just file attachments. 

This...was the video that broke me.

Priyam, on some hotel bed, naked, radiant and smug. Roger, stripped bare of the man I thought I loved, groveling at her feet.

“*She doesn’t matter,*” he said. “*Mary’s nothing compared to you. She’s just…old and tired. I never loved her.* ***You’re the only one.***”

Priyam’s laugh was a dagger to my chest. “*Good,*” she said. “*Because if you even* ***think*** *about her again, we’re done.*”

The knock on my door came as the video looped endlessly on my screen. I didn’t answer. My heart ached, my breaths came shallow and fast. The images blurred as my chest tightened, and darkness crept in from the edges of my vision.

The knock grew louder. "*Did you hear them, Mary?*", came this disembodied voice. "*Did you hear them think you were a pathetic nobody?*"

I can feel my chest tightening.

The door burst open, The Stranger from the internet in a hoodie looking at me with static for eyes. "*Who the hell are you?*"

"*I'm the justice that needs to come for you. You slept with a narcissist and you thought you will keep him? You have a lot of nerve, Mary. You will not hold on to a man that was already cheating to be with you.*", The Stranger let the hoodie off and it was my face staring back at me. 

This isn't happening! My head is spinning. I grabbed my chest. It started to tighten so hard around my throat now. "*Rog loves me, Priyam just poisoned him...*"

"*Your Rog was poison to begin with...*", The Stranger's voice boomed, mocking me. "*You have been loving a man that can never love you because all he ever loved was himself!*". The Stranger grabbed my shoulder with such force that I figured I would pass out. "*You were supposed to disappear in the background, Mary and you thought you* ***could*** *seduce Roger. It's only right that you fade into oblivion, exactly how it was meant to be...*"

"*No!*", I screamed, my throat now closing as I fall to the floor, the pain and heat unbearable as it burned through my chest to my mouth.

I thought I’d hear someone call for help. That Rog, someone—anyone—would come. But no one did.

I died as I had lived: forgotten, alone, a faded melody.
