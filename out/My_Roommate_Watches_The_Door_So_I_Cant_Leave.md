I'm a university student and two days ago, I began renting a room in this apartment downtown. Sure, it's pretty far from the campus, but rent was remarkably cheap, so I thought that would even it out. It would've, if I didn't have this particular roommate who's name I dont actually know. I'll just call him John. 

John is quite skinny and very tall, he has pale white skin, and black soulless eyes. He spends most of his time in his room, and only ever leaves to go to the bathroom. Weirdly enough, we only first interacted this morning, when I tried to leave the apartment so I could go to the local supermarket. The moment I had opened the front door, I felt a cold hand grab me from behind. I was quite shocked, so I turned around and saw John standing there, a wide creepy smile etched on his face. And then he spoke, his tone threatening.

"Where are you going?" 

"Uh, supermarket..." I replied, taken aback by his question. 

Suddenly, he pulled me forwards by the shoulder, and I fell to the ground. He did it so effortlessly. Then, he loomed over me, and spoke again, before retreating to his room. 

"There's food in the fridge. Don't attempt to leave." 

I lay on the floor for maybe half a minute, dazed and confused. Then I went back to my room, wondering what all that was about. At around 3pm, there was a knock on my door, and when I opened it, John was standing there, holding a piece of paper and a pen. He spoke, but this time his tone was softer than it was earlier.

"I'm going to the supermarket, what do you want me to buy?"

I was happy, thinking that this was his way of apology for his behaviour earlier, so I told him everything I wanted him to buy. However, as soon as he left, I realized that maybe he didn't want me to leave, and that was why he was going to the supermarket, not me. The realisation sent chills down my spine. 

I had to escape before John returned. So, I went to the balcony of the apartment, and I watched John enter a black van in the parking lot outside, then speed away. The moment I saw him speed away, I ran towards the front door and opened it. Then I started running down the corridor of the building. I was fast. Too fast.

As I turned the corner towards the stairwell, I bumped into an old man, and he fell to the ground. He had such a sweet face, and I instantly felt bad. It was entirely my fault, I should've not been running. I helped the man up as I apologised, and he smiled warmly at me. But I noticed he was limping, and I was worried for him, so I did the sensible thing and offered to help him to his apartment, as I assumed he lived in this building. He did. In fact, a few doors down from John's apartment. 

As he unlocked the door and entered, he thanked me and welcomed me inside. I was inclined to decline, considering I wanted to be as far away from John's apartment as possible, but the man had such a sweet face, and I figured he could help me. So I went inside and sat down on his couch in the living room, whilst he prepared some tea for me. 

A couple minutes of awkward silence passed, until he brought me my tea, and sat down next to me. I didn't realize it at the time but now, looking back at it, I realized that he wasn't limping anymore. In fact, his leg looked perfectly normal. 

"Again, I'm sorry about bumping into you, and thank you for the tea, it's very nice." 

The man chuckled and said, "No worries, we all make mistakes." 

"It's a stupid mistake, I shouldn't have been running."

Suddenly, the man's demeanour changed from warm to cold, as he spoke, "I wasn't talking about that mistake. I was talking about your mistake of stepping foot into my apartment."

That was the last thing I remember, before I woke up in my room, in John's apartment. Now I'm writing all this, hoping someone will read it, and get me the help I need. Whatever you do though, don't rent a remarkably cheap room. It might just save your life.
