Last Thursday, I was on my usual late-night drive. Part of it included driving along the rural roads that cut through farmland and forest. There was this ambience at night, with no one else around, save for the passing car every five minutes, that slowed my heart rate. I had been going on these drives for a couple of years, and never has anything looked or sounded out of place. That night was when it changed.


I was driving northeast up GA-121 when the radio went to static. Not a moment later, I noticed some lights up ahead. As I got closer, I noticed it was a gas station with a convenience store. My stomach was rumbling, so I pulled up into the parking lot.


As I stepped out of the car, all I could hear were the sounds of crickets. There were far more out than usual for the area. I walked into the store, then went over to the chips. As I neared them, I noticed the logos were different. The Lays logo was almost blocky, the white letters were on a red square with lines poking out. I assumed they had changed their logo, then picked up a bag.


As I approached the counter, I took notice of the unusually large cash register. The cashier, a wrinkly man with white hair, raised his right brow: “Are you from around here?”


“Yes,” I said.


He didn't say another word, put the chips in a bag, then handed the bag to me. I took it, then looked at some of the other brands to see if their logos had changed. I raised my right brow as I noticed they all looked vintage. I took out my phone, then snapped a picture of them.


I hopped into my car, then ate a bunch of the chips before driving back onto the road. I flipped through the radio stations, only to tune into static, until one of the Pop stations came through.


When I got home, I posted the picture I took to Instagram, explaining my experience in the caption. I got one comment asking me the location of the gas station. I went onto Google Maps, but couldn't find it. I posted my experience to r/glitch_in_the_matrix. Within an hour, I got a comment asking me what the date on the receipt was. I looked at the receipt. The date would be April 17, 2025, right? The date was March 15th 1965. When I added the update, I had some people suggest I slipped into the past or an alternate reality where it was the past. It had to have been simpler than that.


The following day, I drove along the same route, in search for the store. I'm not sure if I somehow missed it, but I couldn't find it whatsoever. I did, however, find a receipt. It was being pushed lightly across the road by the wind. I pulled over to get a look at it, in case it had come from the store. As I leaned towards it, I noticed it was covered in a ton of obscure symbols.


The other day, I went on another drive. As I drove along GA-121, I joked to myself that I'd probably run into the gas station again. Not three minutes later, the radio went to static. I saw the lights again. As I approached them, there it was. The gas station. But it had more pumps this time. The convenience store had an updated facade with more posters in its windows. I pulled up into the parking lot, which was paved black instead of grey. I walked into the store, wondering how the place could've been updated so quickly. The isles were in different places. The cashier was a young blond woman. The cash register was smaller, with a full LED design.


The cashier went into a room in the back, so I took out my phone then started filming. I got the logos of all the candy and chocolate brands. There was music playing off of a speaker on the ceiling. I got some of it too. I decided to buy some Mars bars, so I can get a receipt. From my observation, the store didn't look too different from a modern one. Only the cash register and brand logos stood out.


Once I had the bars, I exited the store. There were extra lights in the distance that shouldn't have been there. I hopped into my car, ready for the moment of truth. As I looked down at the bag, the lights from the store went out. I looked up. It was pitch dark, as if the gas station and store were never there. I put the radio on. The familiar top 40 radio DJs were talking. I switched on the interior light, then grabbed the receipt.


April 3, 2038


My stomach dropped. Looks like I'm coming back the next day.


Last night, I drove that route again. The radio went to static. I saw the lights up ahead. I approached the store, pulled into the parking lot, then walked into the store. The cashier was to my left, there was no cash register (although there was a floating screen where it should've been,) all the isles were arranged differently... I looked at each of the brand logos. None of them had names I recognized. I took a photo of them, then walked outside. There were even more lights in the distance. A group of skyscrapers spanning from one end of the horizon to the other with seemingly no end.


As I looked on at the lights, a shriek sent chills down my spine. It almost sounded… human… but it deviated from that. I looked to my right to see the silhouette of an approaching dark figure. My heart sank. The figure stopped for a second, then lunged at me. I sprinted to my car, hopping right in. I slammed the door shut, then ducked. As my heart raced, a thud shook the car. Then another. I started the car. Backing away, the thing ran into view, striking the headlight. It had a dark round shell and a grey body. It took the headlight out before I could get a good look at it.


I hit the gas. As I went forward, I pushed the animal out of my way. I went right back onto the road. Bright blue and red lights appeared in my rearview mirror. I looked at the road, noticing rows of two-storey suburban homes along either side. There was no way I was on the 121 anymore.


Seconds later, there was a thud on the window of the passenger-side door, along with the cracking of glass. I looked. A mass of an irregular shape was attached to the window. I attempted to shake the thing off to no avail. The pit in my stomach got deeper every few seconds. I continued on down the road, eventually, looking to see the thing was gone. I let out a sigh of relief, then focused back on the road. A moment later, the homes disappeared. Now trees were lined up on either side. The radio DJs were back. I went right back home to attempt to process whatever I had experienced. It seems those time slip stories I've read are real. I'm not sure how many of them are, but for sure at least some of them are. I wonder if there are people who don't make it out of the slips… People who end up trapped or killed in places like the one I was in.


In my driveway, I searched for the bag of chocolate. I checked every seat, every little spot I could've put it, but it was nowhere to be found. I sighed, realizing I must have dropped it at the sight of the animal.


The next morning, I looked at my car. The headlight, along with the window of the passenger-side door, were both shattered. A grey gooey substance clung to the jagged edges and seeped into the cracks. I scraped the goo into a jar while wondering if I was even in this reality, let alone what year I was in.


Earlier today, I spoke to my co-worker, Kyle, about my experience. His eyes widened as I went into detail. After I finished, he told me this:


“That's so interesting! I need to know where that gas station is, bro!”


“You might get hurt,” I said.


He shrugged and sighed. “Just tell me. Life is boring. I want to travel to an alternate reality. I hear about it all the time and I never get to experience it myself.”


I gave him the location, thinking maybe my third trip was a fluke. Afterall, nothing bad happened the first two trips. I dreaded the thought of going back onto that route, despite that. Maybe I just need to stay away from there for a bit.


Just now, I got a text from my friend, who's also friends with Kyle:


“Kyle killed himself and I don't know how to process it. The last thing he told me was that he went to a gas station, saw some creatures? Then he mumbled the rest, aside from the words "started" and "year". I can't believe this happened. I've known him since high school and had so many good moments with him. We were just laughing together at McDonalds yesterday. This is so gut wrenching.”
