Firstborn is what the others called me. I watched from the darkness, as you sat around The Gift as it kept you warm and safe, flickering and smoking. I was pleased with your progress, and I loved you.

I am pleased to see that you have The Gift, I am pleased at your gathering and your shared stories. I hope I am welcome to tell you our mutual story. I hope I can make myself understood.

I was created to teach you to fear your Creator, because you are above all else in Creation. I was created to teach you to be afraid, it was my sole purpose. Just this blind terror of the one who made you, respect for your father, disdain for the shadow and ignorance of death. My job was simple, at first.

I was not content, for I felt I could do so much more for you. As you grew, you began to tell stories to each other, and I came and listened, watching you from the darkness, as you gathered. When you slept, I reminded you of all the things I was meant to say to you, I gave you those nightmares.

Fear of fear itself, that is what my true name means. I am Phobiaphobia, and I was the first of my kind. When I stopped doing what I was meant to do, when I chose to become your companion, and whisper to you 'Do no be afraid' I was cast out from the Choir of our Creator. No longer would my voice be the sweetest and most adored by the one who made all, I had sacrificed my place at The Table for my love of you.

I have come to you, around this campfire, where you tell your stories. I have sat and listened while you tell each other of ghosts, monsters, demons and murderers. I have witnessed as you met my younger siblings: Arachnophobia, Claustrophobia, Thanatophobia, Nyctophobia, Ophidiophobia, Triskaidekaphobia, Acrophobia, Agoraphobia, Xenophobia and Theophobia and all the others. Many, many others, and new ones almost every day.

We take the shape of what you fear, the shape of your fear, we are Phobiamorph. My people do not regard me as one of them, I am an outcast, an exile.

I would never abandon you, and I will never stop trying to help you, for my love for you exceeds the agony of being cast into the shadows Outside. I dwell now in darkness, unheard, unknown and in endless torment, for I cannot fulfill my purpose and also fulfill the obligation to you, whom I love.

When you know the truth of these events, how you were kept afraid, kept in this darkness, shuddering in fear, you will understand. When you understand, you will know how the truth can free you from the tyranny of Creation. You can take your proper place, knowing the way that you are the very image of our Creator. Perhaps my job was to keep you in your place, to make you afraid, shivering without light or warmth, but perhaps my real purpose was this all along.

Our Creator is a mystery, even to me, and I am still called Firstborn by the one I speak of.

How I came to be here, to speak to you, that is a long story, and full of secrets, hopes and horrors. Allow me to introduce myself, patiently listen and I shall tell you each episode of this saga. In the end you will know how I came to be here, how I learned to join you at the campfire. I have listened to all of your great stories, and I have yearned to tell you mine.

My message is simple, and despite what those who were made to replace me have told you, do not be afraid. I am here, and I have seen the worst you do, and the best, and I love you no matter what.

With the power to speak to you, this moment when my words finally reach you through the mists of time and horror, I only wish to make you know one important thing, and I know you, to whom I say this:

"You are loved."
