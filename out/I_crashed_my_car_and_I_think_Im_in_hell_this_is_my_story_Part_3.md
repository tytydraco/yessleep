**TW: SELF HARM**

I shot straight up, it felt like I sat up before I even woke up. It was unlike anything I had ever felt. Growing up with a younger sister and relatively strict parents, I was no stranger to being woken up in the most annoying or abrupt ways imaginable, but this was different. I sat up and adjusted into a legs crossed position, trying to catch my breath, it felt like I had been out of breath in my sleep.

“Wait…” - The voice in the back of my mind echoed clearly, piercing through every other thought in my head that was buzzing around in there.

I wasn’t in the hardware store, I was outside, on a field of grass. I ran my hand through the long, damp, brown-green-ish blades of grass that covered the ground as far as I could see. The low-hanging mist that surrounded me felt like it was getting closer by the second, although this was most likely due to paranoia. I slowly stood up and - realized that, Russ was nowhere to be seen. I contemplated whether or not I should call out to him, so many thoughts went through my head, so many reasons not - to do it.

“What time is it? What if any of those freaks are around? Has Russ even woken up yet? Would those things hear me?...” - And so on.

I couldn’t take this anymore, I didn’t even know how many panic attacks I had gotten these past few days. I had never been an anxious person, this place was messing with my mind, making me convince myself that danger was always nearby, that’s what I believe at least.

“Russell!” - I called out, so loudly I could feel my vocal cords vibrating and stretching.

Despite the sharp, scraping pain in my throat and chest, I kept calling out for Russell. I must’ve called out at least 20 times, but I never got an answer. Part of me gave up, once again. Ever since I ended up in this place, it was like I had lost my will to survive; to fight. I sat down and closed my eyes, scrunching up my face in frustration and pain. I opened my eyes again and in the distance, I saw a figure in the mist. My heart dropped before starting to race, had a monster heard my screams and come to hunt me? No, the figure was… human. I could clearly see the outline of a fishing hat and a jacket.

“Hello!?” - I called out

“Can you help me!? Where are we!?” - I called out again, before this person had a chance to answer me.

I still didn’t receive an answer. I decided to give this person the benefit of the doubt, I thought that maybe, they were just old and had bad hearing. A pretty long stretch now that I think about it. Nonetheless, I started slowly inching towards this person that stood completely still, my gaze completely locked on to them with laser focus. As I got closer, I realized this person had their side towards me and wasn’t facing me. I was a little reassured, figuring my hypothesis must’ve been correct. But just as that thought crossed my mind, the figure turned to face me. I was a little taken aback but, I had no other choice but to keep moving towards them if I wanted help, it was my best shot.

“Hello?” - I called out again, with a more passive tone this time.

The person raised their hand up over their head, so as to show me that they see me. I started walking towards them at a normal walking pace. It took a surprisingly long time to start to see the actual features of this person, until I was about 10 feet away from them. It was an old man, not “old” like Russell, this man was actually old, must’ve been older than 80.

“Hey, do you know where w-”

Before I could finish my sentence, the man had brought his right index finger up to his lips, so as to tell me to be quiet. My body tensed up, figuring that someone or something was nearby, considering the old man’s gesture. However, the old man didn’t look scared at all, his face was completely neutral.

“Young man, I would advise you to lower your tone.” - The man said in an oddly calm tone.

I nodded my head in understanding.

“We can not see them, but they can see us. You are… lucky, to have survived your walk over to me. Perhaps it may be that… he does not wish for your death.” - The man continued.

“He? Who is he?” - I whispered.

“The structure you entered earlier, it has phased.” - The man ignored my question.

“Phased? You mean it has disappeared?” - I asked.

“Were you alone in there, young man?” - He ignored my question again.

“No, no, Russ was in there with me.” - I answered.

“I understand. I assume you were not conscious as the building phased, young man.”

“Yeah, no. I was knocked out.” - I answered, confused as to how he knew that.

“This man, you were with, what is his name, young man?” - He asked, in a slightly more serious tone.

“Russell, his name is Russell Cook.” - I answered without knowing why I even did.

“Close your eyes, young man. I shall put your worries to rest.” - The man said as he started walking towards me.

“Weren’t we not supposed to move!?” - I whispered frantically.

As the man was now standing right in front of me, he looked up into my eyes. I could see… something in his eyes. It wasn’t like a glow, it was like they were dimmed but also still bright.

“Young man, of this place you do not know a thing, but I do. Now, I ask you to trust me and close your eyes.” - The man said in a calm tone.

I hesitated for a moment before doing as he said. I closed my eyes and a moment later, I felt an ice cold, rough hand on my face, followed by a blinding blue light that pierced through my eyelids.

“Head north and tread lightly, young man.” - The old man’s voice echoed as the sharp, blue light faded.

It went dark again, my eyes were still closed, it wasn’t like I couldn’t open my eyes, rather something was making me not want to. Suddenly, I felt dizzy, like I was on a rollercoaster. I opened my eyes in panic, I was in the woods again. I stumbled and fell on my back and groaned in pain. My eyes were closed, the damp, cold forest floor pressed against my back, slightly easing the pain. I didn’t know how I was here or what that old man did to me, but I decided to relax for a moment.

\*\*\*

“So uh… kid, you gonna tell me what in the world that was just now?” - A voice called out from beside me in a voice of confusion and fear.

I jolted up and turned my head as I did so, it was Russell. Without answering his question I jumped up to my feet and hugged the old man. He awkwardly patted me on the back to soothe me.

“That hurts kid.” - Russell said as he strained his voice in pain.

“Oh right, sorry.” - I said as I let go and stepped back.

“So… what was that?” - He asked with an intent gaze directed to me.

“What was what?” - I asked even though I did have an inkling as to what he was asking.

“Maybe the fact that you just appeared outta’ NOWHERE, floatin’ a FOOT over the ground?” - He said, like he was dumbfounded as to how I didn’t know what he was talking about.

“It’s gonna take some time to explain, why don’t we head back to the cabin first?” - I answered, not because of the reason I gave him, rather I didn’t even wanna talk about the strange encounter I just had.

“Yeah that sounds great n’ all, there’s just one problem. I have no idea where we are.”

“How about we just head north?” - I said as I remembered the last words of that strange old man.

“And why would we do that?” - Russell asked with one eyebrow raised.

“Just, trust me, I’ll explain later.” - I said, hoping Russell wouldn’t argue further.

“Alright kid, you’ll have hell to pay if you’re leadin’ me the wrong way though.” - Russell said, obviously still not being convinced.

We did as the strange old man had told me before he - presumably - sent me to Russell… Somehow. I brought out the swiss-army knife, realizing I got more and more thankful for the little tool each time I looked at it. I turned until it pointed north and started walking, Russell picked up his rifle from the ground and followed my lead. When I heard him swing the rifle sling over his shoulder, I realized I no longer had the hatchet Russell had lent to me - but - I didn’t wanna risk making him mad over the fact that I had lost it, since it was his son’s and all.

\*\*\*

After a long walk, thankfully devoid of any terrifying, traumatizing monster encounters we were back. As soon as I saw the cabin in the distance, my body started relaxing on its own. I realized how beat up I really was, the wound on my back, a strained ankle, bruising all over my body; it felt like I had fallen down from a cliff. Nevertheless, I kept pushing the last hundred feet or so. Both of us were way too tired to talk, so we just said goodnight and headed to bed, even though we didn’t know if it was night or not. The feeling of laying down was pure ecstasy, laying down in an old, hard bed with a thin mattress, barely deserving of being called a mattress, had never been so comforting.

\*\*\*

I woke up in the middle of the night, there were no sounds, it was completely dark. I just sat up in bed with my legs crossed, hunched over, barely being able to keep my eyes open. Until I heard a rustling sound coming from outside the window to my left, it wasn’t right outside of the window, it sounded more like it was coming from the edge of the clearing that the cabin stood on. I slowly pulled the thick, white curtain away and peeked outside. It was the strange old man, I couldn’t realistically know for sure, he was more than 30 feet away - but - I knew it was him. He was still wearing that oversized coat and his fishing hat, only this time, he was holding something in his right hand. It was a long, crooked stick with a blue-glowing lantern hanging from the top of it. I wasn’t scared, I don’t know how to describe the feeling, it was like a mix between a sense of awe and itching curiosity. As my eyes fixated on the man, it felt like I was looking at some sort of deity, like this man had infinite wisdom. Instead of feeling an uncomfortable feeling of being watched, I felt a sense of safety, of security. It felt like this man, this deity, was here to protect us through the night. Suddenly, I heard a knock on the door behind me, it startled me but I quickly realized it couldn’t be anyone else other than Russ.

“Kid, you awake?” - Russell quietly called out, sounding like he didn’t expect an answer.

“Y-yeah, I’m awake.” - I meekly answered, still thinking about what I had just seen from my window.

“Oh, alright. Well, you wanna have a cigarette? Havin’ a hard time falling asleep.” - Russell said.

“Yeah sure, let me just get dressed and I’ll be out.” - I replied.

I turned my head back to the window, but the old man wasn’t there anymore. I looked around for a few more seconds but I couldn’t see him. I got up and got dressed and headed out. Russell was sitting at the table in the dim light of the living room, fiddling with his lighter.

“There you are.” - He said with a smile.

“Haha, yeah.” - I awkwardly answered.

“You couldn’t sleep either?” - Russ said as he stood up and pushed the chair back under the table.

“Uh… I just woke up out of nowhere.” - I answered as I rubbed my face.

“Oh okay… Anything strange happen?” - He asked as he stood still while looking at me.

“...Nope.” - I said after a pause.

“Okay, that’s great.” - Russ said, although I could hear he didn’t believe me.

\*\*\*

We sat down on the porch, just like we did the first time we shared a cigarette. Without giving me time to take even a single drag of my cigarette, Russell started asking questions, which was understandable to be honest.

“Alright kid, time to explain, what in the world was that earlier? I’ve been thinkin’ about it since we got back, it’s why I couldn’t sleep. Sure, I’ve seen my share of weird shit since I ended up in this cold hell but I ain’t never seen anything like that!... That’s for sure.” - Russell ranted without giving me time to answer his questions.

“Okay, let me start from the beginning. So, you know after we got… attacked by that thing?”

“Yeah?”

“The hardware store “phased”... at least that’s what the old man told me.”

Russell just looked at me with his mouth open and a confused look on his face.

“No, that’s impossible, that building had at least a few weeks left before disappearing.” - Russell tried to convince himself.

“Yeah, you’re right. But, maybe it doesn’t always follow the same rules, maybe they can disappear spontaneously.” - I suggested.

“I’ve been here for years kid, never seen it happen. I don’t even know how many of those uncanny buildings I’ve waltzed into.” - Russell still wasn’t giving it a second thought.

“Yeah, you’re probably right.” - I gave up, I hadn’t known him for long but I knew Russell wasn’t gonna fold.

“So anyway, about the old man. Who is he?” - Russell interrogated me.

“To be honest, I have no idea. After we got attacked I passed out and just woke up in a field and saw him in the distance. I walked up to him and he just started talking all mysteriously and telling me I was lucky to survive the walk to him from where I woke up.” - I said to try and prepare myself for the more weird part about the old man.

“What did he look like?” Russell asked.

“He was really old, had a long beard and fishing clothes on… and his eyes, they were weird.”

“Okay so what happened next?” - Russell asked eagerly.

“He asked me if I was alone in the building, I don’t even know how he could’ve known I was in there in the first place.” - I said as Russell nodded his head, urging me to get to the point, so I continued.

“I told him you were with me, then he told me he would “put my worries to rest” or something. Then he told me to close my eyes and then he put his hand on my face and… it was like a… blue light, a really strong one. I think I blacked out and when I woke up I was in the woods and… then you were there.” - I tried to explain the whole thing as fast as I could.

“A blue light? So it was him after all…” - Russell said as he turned his gaze away from me and down to his feet.

“You know this old man?” - I asked as I turned my whole body towards Russell.

“I don’t… “know” him… I’ve just seen him. With his blue lantern.”

I paused for a moment, part of me feeling relieved because I thought that somehow, maybe I was going insane and just seeing things, but now that Russell had confessed that he too, had seen the man I felt a bit more at ease.

“I saw him outside my window earlier.” - I broke the silence.

Russell just shot me a disappointed “oh…” look, and didn’t respond or talk at all for a while.

\*\*\*

After we both headed back to bed, I had a hard time falling asleep. I spent most of the time just thinking about the old man and what Russ knew about him. Everything just kept getting weirder in this place. Though, eventually I did fall asleep.

\*\*\*

I woke up the next day with a sore body, which was normal at this point. I stayed in bed for a while, trying my best to keep my mind clear of this place. I got up and got dressed and headed out into the living room. Everything was going as usual. But as I was sitting by the dining table, it hit me. I hadn’t seen Russ, this wasn’t normal, he was always up before me no matter what. I knocked on his door and got no answer, I figured he was just sleeping.

\*\*\*

Noon came and I realized I was wrong. Russ still hadn’t come out from his room. I was too scared to enter his room so I just spent the rest of the day hanging out in the cabin and looking for things to entertain myself. When evening came, I decided to head to bed early, hoping I would wake up to Russell being back again. I woke up in the middle of the night just like the night before, the eerie silence was something I still hadn’t gotten used to, there were no sounds, at all. The first thing I did was look outside my window, hoping to see the strange old man again but, he wasn’t there. I went back to sleep instead.

\*\*\*

I woke up the next morning and this time, got dressed and went out into the living room a little quicker to see if Russ had gotten back. I was convinced that he would be back, there’s no way he’d travel far without me and especially not without telling me. He did tell me “four hands are better than two, son.”. But lo and behold, he wasn’t back. I even called out to him this time but I never got an answer. Russell’s absence was starting to weigh on me, so to distract myself I decided to wander around the clearing that the cabin stood on. Despite the thick, never ending clouds above, it was quite bright outside so I wasn’t that scared. To no one’s surprise, there wasn’t anything interesting in the clearing so I headed back inside after an hour or so. I’m not gonna lie, I was getting more and more anxious and paranoid, it did feel a little embarrassing to be a grown man and relying on another man so much but what was I supposed to do? I spent the rest of the day fiddling with anything I could hold, pacing around the cabin and looking out of my window. When night came I had a much harder time sleeping, which was unsurprising considering how stressed I was becoming over Russell’s disappearance. But after a few hours, I did fall asleep.

\*\*\*

Another morning came and I did the same thing again, got up, got dressed and headed into the living room to wait for Russell to come out of his room. But he never did. I must’ve waited for at least an hour but he didn’t come out. At this point, I’d had enough, so I knocked on Russell’s door one last time before entering. What I saw was worse than any monster or any other weird things I had seen in this place. It was Russell, or rather his body. His head was gone, the only thing that was left was his lower jaw, barely hanging on. I’d never seen so much blood, so much gore, not even on the internet. As I looked at the bloody stump that stood atop Russell’s shoulders, I felt my stomach churning. I stumbled out of my room and out through the front door, I leaned over the porch and threw up for minutes. My whole body was shaking, I was mortified. What was I going to do without Russell?

\*\*\*

I spent the whole day sitting on the porch until it got dark, but I wasn’t scared of monsters this time. I felt completely empty. It was like I had expended all of my emotions in a few minutes. I was getting tired so I headed inside again, as I closed the front door behind me I looked to my left, into Russell’s room. My heart did skip a beat for a second, but the same empty feeling - or rather - the lack of any feeling at all, quickly came back. I slowly walked towards his room, I stopped in the doorway and looked towards Russell’s body, leaned up against his wall. As I looked at his body, I didn’t feel anything, I didn’t even feel bad for not feeling anything; it was just empty. I looked towards his bed and I spotted a dozen pieces of paper. I walked up to them and grabbed them, they were notes. I walked out of Russell’s room and closed the door behind me.

\*\*\*

As evening came, I was sitting on my bed, thinking about why Russell had done this. I mean sure, I just happened to come into Russell’s life, if you can even call living in this place a life, but was it really necessary to do this? Didn’t he have any hope of getting out of here? What were the supply-runs for then? I just couldn’t comprehend it. I felt a tear streaking down my cheek which surprised me since I wasn’t feeling anything. I wiped my tears and looked over at the stack of notes Russ had left behind. I decided there was no reason not to read them, it was the only thing I could do to try and understand him, it would probably give the reason for Russell’s suicide.
