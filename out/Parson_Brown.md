Yeah, it’s Christmas in July. I should have posted this months ago, but I didn’t. I wanted to make sense of it first. 

I can’t. Tess is gone.

December was the last time I saw her, and I’m starting to think it was my fault. 

—————————————————

Most days, I felt more like her parent than her sister. That’s what a twelve year age gap will do to you.

But I wasn’t. I wasn’t her parent.
Every time I tried to step into that role, it only made it clearer — I’d never be enough to fill the space our Mom left. If anything, my efforts only drove home how unqualified I was. We were both grieving, and she didn’t want anything to do with me. She wanted *her Mom*, her real mom. And I don’t blame her. So did I.

It took the promise of a new phone to goad Tess onto the bus home — and no wonder, she’d been dragging the same Nokia around since high school. Which, to be fair, wasn’t that long ago. She skipped a grade, landed in University a year early and liked to act as if that made her grown. Like she knew better. 

There was so much she didn’t know. So much I kept from her.

You’d think she was here for a root canal, not Christmas vacation. She dropped her bag on the floor and beelined for our old couch without so much as a glance in my direction — couldn’t even look at the tree. Just stared at that brick of a phone, which I’m sure as shit wasn’t that interesting. It was better suited for self defense than communication. But looking anywhere else might’ve reminded her of the wrong things.

I got it. I’d been here alone since it happened, living with it.

In light of that, neither of us were feeling festive. I burned the gingerbread and the smell stuck around, an acrid and stubborn perversion of Mom’s recipe. The trailer felt empty. It was a tight fit for the three of us. Now, the space between Tess and me was vast.

The trailer park had been swallowed up around me, a graveyard of empty lots and sleeping bulldozers. Crescent Lake was a ghost town. I stayed out of habit, mostly. Or to help Mom, or — the memories, maybe. But I wanted out, bad. I *needed* out, had since I was fifteen. It’s just that — for whatever reason, I never made it happen. 

Tess got out. She was the youngest child; I’d tried my best to make sure she had the means. Or maybe, she *was* the means. 

First to go to University. Full ride. Thin and tall and blonde, completely unlike me in every way. But she worked hard, really hard. 

And I waited for something to happen.

There was an implicit understanding that this would be our last Christmas in the home we’d grown up in. The neighborhood gave up on me way before I was ready to give up on it. Looking back, I’m ashamed of how long I stayed.

Tess wasn’t even nineteen, but she didn’t blink when I poured her a rum and eggnog. We both needed one, I told myself — though maybe I just didn’t want to drink alone. And still — even seen through the bottom of those heavy, dimpled glasses — the old kind, the ones you could knock someone out with if you aimed just right — the Rankin-Bass specials just weren’t hitting. No magic, no goodwill or joy or peace on earth. Just one burnout, one golden child fresh off her first semester at Dalhousie. A dead mom. A shitty trailer that smelled like scorched molasses.
We needed to do something spontaneous. 

About half way through Frosty, it hit me. I clapped my hands to my thighs like a sitcom character about to turn the whole episode around. 

“Right!”

Tess flinched, eggnog up her nose.

“We’re making a snowman,” I said.

“Mm. No.”

I half-stumbled from my seat, already telling myself this would be the turning point — every holiday special needed one. “No, no, not a snowman,” I continued, still riding the high of impulse and eggnog. “A snowmom.”

Mom’s black duffle coat and her summer sunhat. Neither seasonal, both iconic. I looked like a magician mid-reveal as I proudly unearthed them from the back of the closet.

Tess just stared. A long, disbelieving look that sparked with rage then fizzled into pity. “You need therapy.”

“Can’t afford it.”

“You’re drunk!”

“Cheaper than therapy.”

She rolled her eyes, but the fight had gone out of it. “Jesus, you’re such a mess.” A pause.

 “Fine. Quick, before I change my mind.”

We crossed into the empty lot across from ours, where the snow laid untouched — smooth and unspoiled by boot prints and tire tracks. Our own yard was too churned up with slush and old salt and half melted garbage bags. This side felt serene, like it held real potential for Christmas magic. I bent down and started rolling the base, grunting with effort. Tess joined me with slow, reluctant resignation.

“I’ll do her ass,” I said. “You do her middle.”

“You’ll be rolling for a while,” she muttered.

I laughed, but my body looked just like Mom’s. Same wide hips, same soft slope of the shoulders.

We built her, quite literally, larger than life — Mom was 5’ on a good day, and this thing towered over us both. A big, heavy, looming presence. We had built her how she seemed when we were small — a mythical figure.

From the kitchen, I grabbed the leftover icing and decorations I’d meant for the cookies — still sealed, still a failure. We gave her smeared eyelids, a hooked nose sculpted from a bent twig, a raisin beauty mark. But the colors bled fast in the snow, and the borders of her mouth collapsed into something else. Less of a lipstick smile, and more like a wide, yawning pit.

I dressed her before I could think too hard. The coat helped. The hat turned her into a preacher. Tess said she looked like that old print Mom used to hang every year — the one of the solemn pastor skating alone in a frozen lake, hands clasped behind his back. I suppose it was meant to be charming, but all I could see was the loneliness in it.

I wondered where it went. One of the boxes stuffed in her closet, the ones I hadn’t been ready to open, maybe. Afraid of what I’d find.

She would have hated the outfit, wouldn’t be caught dead in *that* coat and *that* hat. But we couldn’t leave her bald. Even sick, even when the treatments took her hair, we never saw her without makeup and a cheap— an *affordable* wig. No, there were parts of her she never let us near. 

Sometimes I wished she’d died back then, when it made sense. 

Tess didn’t say much, but she helped — that was enough. The snow was cold and dry and hard to shape, but we packed more into the cracks as if stuffing a wound. Our faces were red, bodies drenched with sweat beneath our coats by the time it was over.

I always wondered why Tess humored me that night. Maybe it was guilt — she’d skipped Thanksgiving that Fall, and it must have weighed on her. The last time the three of us sat for a meal was the day before she left for school. She’d been too excited to eat.

Neither of us saw it coming. She stayed sober through every round of chemo. Tess didn’t need to know what came after — that slow undoing. She wasn’t there when Mom clawed herself down the hall, like it was liable to fall away beneath her, leaving behind a modest trail of acrylic nails. She never made it to the kitchen phone.

Honestly, neither did I — she was cold when I found her, frothing at the mouth. I was clutching a six-pack in one hand and my keys in another. That was me to a tee. 

There were painkillers in her system. 
Leftovers, probably. 

We finished the snowmom in silence. It didn’t look like anyone, least of all her. An essence that was hard to capture.

“Well,” Tess said, tugging her coat closer. “It’s getting kinda cold.”

“That’s right,” I said. “Santa’s almost here.”

She didn’t laugh, just headed back inside. I trailed behind. Even her boots prints were soft and even, compared to mine. We didn’t say goodnight. We didn’t say Merry Christmas. I let her take my bed and poured another eggnog.

Then I lingered on the porch, sentimental, contemplative. Also, I needed a smoke. 

The snow made everything quiet. I knew the neighbors had been gone for months, but it felt — it felt more like all the sound and life in the park was trapped beneath the ice, just waiting for a thaw.

I took a sip.

From this angle, the adjacent lot looked less enchanting and more like what it was — abandoned. The snowmom stood ominously in the darkness, cast in shadow where the trailer’s light couldn’t quite reach. She was lopsided, her features muddled — but I could see her face was already beginning to slide, icing pooling at her chin like drool.

I stood there for a while, as if something might happen.

Nothing did.

Crouching, I poured a bit of my drink into the slush beyond the porch and watched it soak into the snow like piss. “Merry Christmas, Mom.”

The snowmom wasn’t the worst I’d seen her. Neither was the kitchen floor.

She’d collapsed on Thanksgiving. It had taken hours for someone to come get the body. No one was in a rush to drop their plans and drive out to an empty trailer park. 

Her body, it’d started to change.

I never told Tess about that. Or the scratch marks on the hallway floor. She’d passed over them on the way to bed without knowing. 

I hadn’t told her there’d been a Turkey in the oven. How Mom splurged, just in case she showed up. How the table was set for three. 

How she was sitting there when rigor mortis set in, and the looks of quiet disgust the paramedics gave me when they finally came to take her to the morgue. As if it was my fault they’d waited for her to grow stiff.

I had to eat those leftovers for weeks.

The snowmom wasn’t the worst I’d seen her, but I couldn’t bring myself to look up again before butting out my cigarette and going inside.

*The Year without a Santa Claus* was well underway. I assumed my position on the couch and drank until I passed out.

The night wasn’t done with us. The next part is hard. Even to think about. I’ll get to it when I can.

If you’ve heard of any unsolved disappearances near Crescent Lake Park in Nova Scotia, Canada, please let me know.
