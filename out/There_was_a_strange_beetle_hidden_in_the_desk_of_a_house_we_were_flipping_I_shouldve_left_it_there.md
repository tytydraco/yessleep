My Uncle Joe is a house flipper. He buys distressed or abandoned houses, fixes them up, and sells them for a profit. He's been doing it for years, and he's pretty good at it. Sometimes I help him out. It's not a bad way to make some cash over the summer, and I get to hang out with my uncle. The work is tough, but it beats flipping burgers or answering phones.

We've found some wild things over the years: an old moonshine still, dozens of clay statues scattered through a crumbling artist commune. But mostly it's junk. Furniture so rotten that it's not worth saving. Toys cracked in the sun. Forgotten photo albums. All of it gets tossed.

Eventually, everything meaningful to us becomes someone else's forgotten trash.

Out of all the strange things I came across while working with my uncle, I never kept any of them.

Until last week.

We were working on a split-level house out in the county. It was in decent shape. It just needed a deep clean, a coat of paint, and a few new cabinets. The only furniture left inside was a broken cabinet-style TV and an antique roll-top desk.

I've always had a thing for antique furniture, so I had to check it out.

I was going through the drawers, cubbyholes, and hidden compartments when I jumped back, startled.

There was a huge bug. Not a real one, but some kind of carving.

I'd never seen anything like it. A beetle, carved from a greenish-gray stone, maybe green lapis or serpentine, with metallic veins running through it. The veins looked like tarnished silver, aged to a purplish hue. The surface was polished smooth, and the craftsmanship was uncanny. It looked way too lifelike. If it weren't for the strange coloring, I might have expected it to crawl away the moment I blinked.

It was also heavier than it should have been.

Look, I know. I should have left it alone. That's one of my uncle's rules: “Dump everything, keep nothing. Get it cleaned and sold.”

But I couldn't resist. I felt drawn to it. Like it was meant for me.

So I slipped it into my cargo pocket and went back to running the Rug Doctor over the stained carpet. Uncle Joe's a great guy, but he expects you to work hard.

I felt a little guilty about taking it. But seriously, if it were important, someone wouldn't have left it behind, right?

After a long, sweaty day of lugging that 50-pound machine up and down stairs, Uncle Joe dropped me off with a fat envelope of cash. Probably not IRS-approved, but I'm not asking questions.

I placed the beetle carving on my desk, between my Dr. Doom figure and G1 Optimus Prime. Then I settled into my usual summer night routine: greasy pizza and way too many video games.

That night, I dreamed of skittering. Something tapping, clicking, just outside the edge of sleep.

The next morning, the beetle had moved.

Not shifted. Moved. From one side of the desk to the other. It was now sitting beside my wireless mouse.

I told myself I must have moved it while playing, or maybe I just didn't remember where I placed it. Still, something felt off.

That day, I had another eight hours of dragging the Rug Doctor through what looked like the aftermath of a war crime. The carpet was soaked with something thick and greasy. It came up in globs, like someone had poured motor oil and stomped it into the weave.

By the time I finished, the machine was choking on sludge, and I couldn't scrub the smell off my hands. It clung to me, oily and metallic. Even after a shower, I kept catching whiffs of it. I told myself it was just in my head. Just the job, sticking with me.

I collapsed into bed, more tired than I had been in a long time.

I woke up to a soft clicking sound.

Rhythmic. Precise. Like a metronome.

Click. Click. Click. Click.

At first, I thought it was coming from the hallway. But when I sat up, I realized the sound was in the room.

I turned on my bedside lamp.

The beetle carving was gone.

I hadn't touched it. I hadn't moved it.

But I had.

I looked down and saw it in my hand, clenched so tightly that a thin trickle of blood had leaked between my fingers.

I slowly opened my fist.

It looked almost alive.

Its legs, six thin, jagged limbs, had unfolded. Each one looked like a tiny blade, curled outward and still twitching slightly.

Then, without warning, they retracted. Smooth and quiet, as if it had never moved at all.

I wanted to scream. To throw it. To run. But I couldn't move. My entire body was frozen. My heart was pounding.

I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. It didn't do anything else after that, but just to be safe, I put it inside an old thermos I had lying beside the desk.

So I'm sitting here now, rolling the carving around in my fingers. For some reason, it feels relaxing to do so. I'm not saying I don't want to put it down, just that it fits so well in my hand.

Wait.

When did I take it out?

I don't remember opening the thermos.

I'm not sure what's going on here, and I'm starting to get [worried.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lrth5x/there_was_a_strange_beetle_hidden_in_the_desk_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
