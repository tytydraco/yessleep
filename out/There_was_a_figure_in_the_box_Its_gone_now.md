I work at a GameStop-type shop in my local mall. It's as empty as you'd imagine, given the current gaming landscape. Most people only come in to window shop, pick up an online order, grab a book or maybe a record. Or they stop by because they’re around and figure they might as well take a look.

We have a merchandise section with shelves full of the usual: plushies, Funko Pops, and a glass cabinet in the middle displaying statues, figures, and Amiibo-type critters. The kind of stuff most self-respecting people just order on Amazon nowadays.

While stocking inventory in that section, a figure caught my eye. It wasn’t from any recognizable franchise, or even one of those cult classics that get revived as TikTok sensations. There weren’t multiples of it either, only the one I held in my hands.

It was a magical girl - or boy - I couldn’t tell because the hair was rather short. Pink hair, pink eyes, and seemingly part of a trio with other minimally designed characters with distinct color motifs, two of which were sold separately. The figure stood upright, completely stiff, with its arms behind its back in a bland pose. The box said 'weapon included', probably referring to a wand, but I couldn’t see one. It wasn’t pictured either. The only image was only a group illustration on the front of the box. It was manufactured by a studio whose name I didn’t recognize and don’t remember.

I checked the system, slapped on a price tag, put it with the others, clocked out. End of day. I don't /watch 99% of the shows I stock merchandise for, so needless to say I forgot all about it and even struggled to even recall it, whenever a coworker called me over about that same figure. Something was **glaringly** not as I remembered.

The figure had disappeared, but the box was still there. Normally, that would mean someone stole it, except the box was completely factory sealed. Mint condition. No dust, no signs it had ever been opened. The plastic casing molded to the figure was still inside, complete with the little paper cuffs still tied as if it were still holding something together inside.

Now that the figure wasn’t blocking it, a sticker was visible stuck to the background. The text was tiny but bold:

"WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU AFTER PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT.

IF 'BEAR' IS ABSENT FROM THIS BOX WHILE UNOPENED, CALL A MEMBER OF THE STORE'S STAFF IMMEDIATELY.

IF THE FIGURE GOES MISSING WITHIN THE PERIMETER OF YOUR HOME, WE WON'T BE ABLE TO REACH YOU IN TIME.

CALL THE NUMBER IN THE PAMPHLET AND WAIT FOR OUR ARRIVAL FROM A DIFFERENT LOCATION. THANK YOU."

My coworker was just as confused as I was, but I couldn't show it, because that box had not been empty when I was last seen shelving it. I don't know if it was smart of me, but I told her it was like that when I found it, hoping she wouldn’t press me further.

When she turned to put the box back, I took it from her and said I’d take a closer look — maybe I’d made a mistake, I said, more honestly than I’d like to admit. I marched to the back room and ripped the box open, looking for the pamphlet the sticker had mentioned.

At first, it just contained information about the character and the show, but then I found a section labeled 'Possible Occurrences':

\- If "Bear's" face has changed (facial expression or features), **call \[REDACTED\] immediately.**

\- If "Bear's" scythe is gone, **call \[REDACTED\] immediately.**

\- If "Bear" moves, the doll has no joints. **Call \[REDACTED\] immediately.**

\- If "Bear" "speaks", the doll has no voice box. **Call \[REDACTED\] immediately.**

\- If "Bear" has been misplaced but not by you, **call \[REDACTED\] immediately.**

With No further Instructions, I called the number. The person who answered barely gaVe me the opportunity to speak. They asked for my location as soon as they picked up and asked if the figure had seen anyone’s face. After I told them it disappeared at a store and told them the address, they hung up. Presumably after gathering all the intel needed to act.

A couple of guys showed up about twenty minutes later. They had the same logo from the boX on T\_heir jackets. They spoKe with the manager and left with the box, which was still emPty.

I wo n deR if any of those “possible occurrences” had happened while I wasn’t lookin g . I asked the manager what the guys told him, or even if he'd seen anything. According to him, he hadn't seen, nor had been asked, anything particularly unusual. The only strange thing was that, during the time this all happened, our store’s computer system sent out a ton of spam emails with a virus attached. There’s no clear connection to the figure obviously, but I’m not ruling any anomalies out from now on.

I’ll update you if anything else happens.
