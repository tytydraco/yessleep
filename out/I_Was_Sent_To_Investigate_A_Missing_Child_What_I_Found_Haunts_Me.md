I took early retirement two months ago.

They say it was voluntary, but if you read between the lines, the transfer, the psych eval, the months of leave before I resigned, you'd see the truth. I never told anyone what really happened in that village. Not the chief superintendent, not the shrink they assigned me, not even my wife, who thinks it was just burnout.

It wasn't burnout. I know what I saw. And more importantly, I know what I heard in that cellar.

But I'll start at the beginning.

The village is a speck on the map in Northumberland. Two rows of cottages, one pub, one post office, and fields that go on forever. The kind of place where time folds in on itself. I was stationed nearby and sent out to assist local police when a girl went missing.

Her name was Abigail, 12 years old. Disappeared on a Tuesday afternoon between school and home. She should have walked back with her friend Lucy, but told her she was cutting through the woods to take a shortcut. Except there was no shortcut, just miles of dense forest and farmland.

Her parents were frantic. Understandably.

I met them the night she vanished. Good people, salt of the earth types. Her father was shaking so bad he couldn't hold his tea. Her mother kept glancing at the clock every few seconds, like if she stared hard enough, time would reverse.

The local constable, a man named Pritchard, was already out of his depth. No CCTV in the village, no reports of strangers, no signs of struggle.

I took over coordination and brought in dogs and drones by the next morning. We combed every square meter of woodland for three days. Nothing. Not a footprint, not a thread of clothing. She'd vanished like smoke.

Then on the fourth day, we found something.

It was a dog walker about two miles from the village near an abandoned farmstead. The dog had gone ballistic near the collapsed barn and started digging at the earth.

That's where we found the ribbon. Pink satin with a tiny silver bell. Abigail's mother confirmed it was hers.

The barn itself was unsafe. Roof half caved in, floor rotted. But below it, there was a trap door sealed with rusted iron bolts.

And this is where things get odd.

The floor above the trap door hadn't collapsed. There was no way the dog could have smelled anything through solid oak beams and a foot of earth, but it did. And it led us to that exact spot like it had been called there.

We broke the lock. The air that came up smelled like old stone and wet iron. We descended.

The cellar was far too large.

Carved into the bedrock with old tools. Pritchard said the farmhouse had no records of underground storage, no history, no maps, not even local gossip. But here it was. Fifteen feet underground with stone shelves, iron hooks, and something that looked a lot like restraints bolted to the wall.

We searched every inch. No girl. Just one small shoe tucked behind a broken crate, and carved into the wall six feet up: Alive, written in chalk, still fresh.

That word stayed with me.

We brought in forensics. They lifted Abigail's prints off the shoe. The ribbon, too, but nothing else. No DNA, no signs of anyone else. We interviewed every villager twice. I walked the woods alone some nights, flashlight in one hand, recorder in the other.

That's when it started.

At first, it was small things. My mobile would turn on in the middle of the night and start recording. Voice memos I didn't make, just static and faint whispers I couldn't make out.

Then came the knocks.

Three times over the next week, I woke to a faint knock on my guest house door at precisely 2:11 AM. Each time I opened it to find no one. On the third night, I stayed up and recorded the hallway.

When I reviewed the footage the next morning, my stomach turned.

At 2:11 AM, the camera shook slightly, then captured my own voice whispering: She's in the orchard.

Except I never said that.

I didn't tell anyone. Didn't want to be pulled off the case. Instead, I went back to the farmstead. Daylight this time.

I paced the area around the barn. Found nothing.

But the feeling, that pressure behind the eyes, that wrongness in the air, it stayed with me.

The next night, I got a call. An old woman who lived alone at the edge of the village nearest to the farmstead. She'd seen something, she said. Her voice trembled over the line.

"Two nights ago," she told me when I got there, "I saw a girl running across the field."

"Did you recognize her?"

"She looked like the missing girl, but she wasn't right."

I frowned. "Not right how?"

"She was barefoot, mud up to her knees, but her clothes weren't torn. And her face..." She hesitated. "It didn't look scared. It looked calm, like she was walking in her sleep."

"Where did she go?"

"Toward the farmstead. Toward the barn."

I stayed out there until dawn. Nothing.

A week passed. The official search was scaled down. The press moved on, but I didn't. The case got inside me. I barely slept, ate standing up. My wife said I talked in my sleep, muttering about cellars and chalk and ribbons.

Then one night, storm rolling in over the moors, I returned to the farmstead one last time.

The barn was creaking in the wind. The trees swayed like they were trying to whisper to each other.

I descended the cellar steps with my torch and recorder.

Everything was as we had left it. Empty.

But the word Alive was gone, scrubbed clean.

In its place, one word newly written in shaky chalk: Colder.

I turned, heart pounding.

A sound behind me, soft, delicate. A giggle.

I spun and caught it in the beam. A girl, pale, dirty feet, wearing a nightgown.

"Abigail," I whispered.

She just stared at me, smiling.

I reached out, but she stepped backwards into the darkness and vanished.

I ran to the spot. Nothing, just stone wall.

I don't know how long I stood there, torch shaking.

Eventually, I left. Didn't sleep that night. Didn't go back the next day.

They found her three days later, wandering along the roadside near a neighbouring town, disoriented. Clothes clean, no bruises, no injuries. Dehydrated, but otherwise unharmed.

The doctor said she'd been fed recently. No signs of trauma.

She didn't remember anything.

She just kept repeating the same thing. The man in the cellar was nice.

They assumed it was a coping mechanism, a way to process fear, but I knew better.

I asked to see her one last time. Off the record. I just wanted to ask a single question.

I sat across from her in the hospital room. She looked at me calmly, swinging her legs off the side of the bed.

"Abigail," I said. "Was the man in the cellar old or young?"

She tilted her head. "He didn't have a face."

They closed the case. Everyone celebrated a miracle. The girl who came back.

But I know what I saw in that cellar. And I know what I heard because the night after she was found, I played one of the voice memos from my phone.

It was my own voice again, muttering over and over: 

She's not the same. 

She's not the same. 

She's not the same.

Then silence.

Then a child's voice, soft like it was speaking right next to the microphone.

"Neither are you."
