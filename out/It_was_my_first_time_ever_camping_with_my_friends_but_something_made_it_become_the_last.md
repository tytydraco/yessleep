I've always been someone who loved adventures, who enjoyed exploring the unknown. When I decided to go on my first camping trip, I was both excited and nervous at the same time. Nothing could prepare us for what was about to happen.

- C'mon dude we're gonna be so late.
Said Nate as he finishes packing his travel bag.

- Don't be so dramatic man, we have time, it's just 5am and the traffic isn't that bad.
 Micah replied while packing some snacks in a cooler.

- And besides, the girls that are coming to get us, If anyone is late here, it's the fancy nancys that are taking too long.

As I also finish packing my stuff, we hear a horn coming outside their house, it was Theda and Sue arriving in the doorstep.

- WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG, WE HAVE A SCHEDULE TO FOLLOW .
 Sue shouts from the window.

Nate put his baggage in the trunk alongside with mine and Micah's, we enter the car and as everyone puts their seatbelts on and the roadtrip starts.

We kept taking turns in the driver's seat so everyone can rest a little, the camping local was in another city, it wasn't a very long road trip but everyone was looking very tired, it was also their first time ever camping, everyone was pretty excited with everything.

- I think it's here.
Theda exclaims while parking the car.

The place was like looking at the old Windows 97 wallpaper, it was filled with grass, trees and ponds. Further ahead there was a beach that connected to the city, in the distance there were some old cabins where other campist were housed but it wasn't very close to our shack.

- It looks very.... artificial??
Said Nate. 

- WHO CARES, THEY HAVE NATURAL POOLS.
 Micah shouted excitedly before jumping right into a pond near the shack.

- At least you could have helped us with the luggage Micah.
Sue said while entering the house.

The shack looked old but surprisingly cozy, almost a "generic Christmas calendar-like" shack, it has a fireplace, two rooms with bathrooms alongside with a social bathroom, the kitchen was small but it had room enough for the stove with an oven and the fridge near the cabinets. But something caught our attention, one big trumpet that seemed to be made of bones hanging on the wall with a print that says "צליל אחד הנפלט מהחצוצרה הזו יציל את כל בני האדם" 

- Hey guys, check this out.
Micah said as he walks in.

- Whoa that's such a beautiful horn, I used to play one of these in my old highschool band.
 Said Nate while admiring the instrument

- That's not a horn dumbass, that's a trumpet, and as it seems, a very very VERY old one, the kind that should be in a museum, not in a old Airbnb shack. Wait, it has something carved in the frame, but I think it's in... Hebraic? this trumpet must be older than my grandparents.
  I said while analysing the trumpet trying to read what was written

As the night falls we decided decided to sleep the first night in our tents outside the shack, Micah and Nate gathered a bunch of wood to make a bonfire.

- So now what?
 Asked Nate 

- I have an idea. 
 Micah said as he grew a smirk.

- We should tell scary stories.

- Oh wow how original you are Micah.

- Well it's not my fault you're such a scaredy cat Nate, everytime that we had a sleepover at my house you always cried watching horror movies.

- W-well that's not the case, I think we should do something else.

- Oh I like the scary story idea.
  I said while looking at everyone

- I think we should pick randomly someone to start.
   Theda exclaimed 

- I know how we can do it.
 Sue finished drinking her beer, spinned the empty bottle and it stopped at Nate 

- You start crybaby.

- I'M NOT A-. 
 Nate took a deep breath, threw some water at the campfire dimming it

- Fine, I'll tell a scary story.

- The clock struck midnight. Sarah heard a knock at the door. She opened it to find... no one. Suddenly, a voice whispered behind her: "I'm in front of you." She turned around, but there was nothing. Then she realized: she was the one knocking all along. The end.

 We bursted out laughing non stopping after hearing that terrible story.

- YOU CALL THAT A SCARY STORY??
 Sue shouted as she laughs

- HOW DID YOU EVEN CAME UP WITH THIS
   I said mocking Nate 

After a while we calmed down and Micah stood up

- You guys wanna know what's really scary??
 Micah pulled out the trumpet while a grin started to grow on his face.

- Wait Micah I don't think we're allowed to touch this.
 Theda exclaimed fearful 

- Yeah you crossed the line there Micah, put that back in the wall, that's not funny.
 Said Nate

- Oh so I came on a trip with a bunch of chickens, it's just a trumpet, don't tell me you guys are afraid of a musical instrument.

- It's not like that, it's because this trumpet doesn't look like it can be taked from its place like it's a toy or something.
 I said while backing off a little.

- Well if it's not that so you guys wouldn't mind if I...

Micah brings the trumpet to his mouth and blows it, a loud and thunderous sound came from the trumpet, a sound that resembled the roar of ten leopards echoed throughout the camp area and frightened the group of friends.

- Woah for a old ass trumpet this was a huge sound.

- I think we should go to sleep, that's enough for today.
 Theda said while tucking herself in the tent 

- Goodnight everyone.

The night has passed but the day looked different, the sky was no longer blue. It was not just red. It bled, like open flesh set ablaze. The sun, once majestic, now looked like a black hole amidst the fire. The stars we're slowly blowing up one by one, we woke up with a terrified look, we've never had seen something like that before.

- What... THE FUCK... IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.      Nate shouted when he got out of his tent 

- GUYS WAKE UP WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE NOW.

A loud siren could be heard through the speakers alongside, everyone is panicking, the other campists were running to their cars wanting to get out of there as fast as possible, people started to push each other, step over each other, a newsflash transmission can be heared in the radio and in the televisions all over the state.

- Attention citizens from the United States of America, it looks like we're We are going through a catastrophic situation never seen before, scientists and meteorologists from all over the world report that several celestial bodies are exploding throughout outer space, we cannot explain why this is happening and we do not have a concise explanation for the current color of the sky, what we can recommend today is not to leave your house, Stay with your family, say your prayers and repent for your sins, God save America, this is reporter Morales talking to you possibly for the last time.

Due to the gravity of the situation, this news must have been transmitted worldwide, everyone started to run for their lifes but we entered the shack to wait for the chaos to ease a little.

- DID YOU GUYS JUST HEARD WHAT I HEARD???         Micah screamed after grabbing his stuff and shoving in his bag.

 - THAT'S NOT FUCKING NORMAL, THAT'S SOME HORROR MOVIE FUCKED UP THING, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO???

- Cursing everyone and everything isn't gonna help Micah, we need to calm down, you heard the reporter, we have two options, stay here and wait for something to happen, or we pray for a miracle.
 Sue stated while sitting on the couch and turning the TV on

- Besides, What are four dysfunctional adults going to do in a situation like this huh? call 911 and wait for them to do absolutely nothing??
 I said while sitting on the couch with Sue

I took a look to the corner of the room and I saw Theda starting to shake and cry out loud.

- I don't wanna die, I just got accepted in college, I have so much things to do, I don't wanna lost everything, my family, my girlfriend, my friends, I
can't handle this.
 Theda falled on her knees and started to sob with her hands on her face.

Sue got up from the couch to comfort her.

- Hey, hey it's ok, everything's gonna be ok, don't worry we're here for you.

We heard a knocking on the door, Nate who was near the entrance opened it, it was a ranger that works in the camping area.

- Yes?

- I'm so sorry to do this but I need you four to leave our establishment as soon as possible, we were ordered to get rid of everyone, we do not have idea of what's happening here so it's for your major security.

- I'm sorry what?? can't you see the chaos that's out there, we're safer here than in our own car, everyone is going crazy running out of that beach, the city is a mayhem, do you see that stars are EXPLODING???

- I know, and I'm really sorry but you guys need to evacuate right now, orders from the boss.

- You know what I'm not arguing with you right now, let's go everyone.
 Nate grabs every bag he can and just shove it all on the car

We entered Nate's car and we drove across the beach as a shortcut to the capital, I looked through the window and I saw the image of living hell, people were crying and screaming in fear, nothing seemed real right now, it feels like a nightmare, but unfortunately I wasn't dreaming.

When we arrived at the coastline a citizen pointed at the sky and started to scream, several meteors were entering Earth's orbit, ready to collide. 

Tons of meteors started to hit every building, cars, houses and people, everyone was running around in panic, hugging their parents and begging for a miracle. We looked around and none of us had no idea of what to do, until Theda saw a car that pulled over in the center of the chaos but it looked kinda... familiar.

- THEDA??? MY BABY
  It was Theda's mom, she had a teary eye while her family was getting out of the car

- MOM!!

They did a terrible mistake parking in the middle of the street, someone accidentally pushed Theda's mom while running and as everyone was running for their lives a car was coming in full speed

- MOM WATCH OU-

The car smashed Theda's mom's head, there was blood and gushers all over the street, everyone that saw the accident started to scream even more, not just because of the accident they just witnessed but also because of the meteor that was about to hit that area. 

The meteor hit near the car where Theda's family was, the impact and heat were so strong that boiled the car's gas to a extremely high temperature that made the car explode. Everyone in that area and in near parts died because ouf the impact, including Theda's family.

- NO NO NO NO NO NO

The shock hit like a lightning—paralyzing, brutal.
Blood spilled, flesh torn, Theda's chest tightened, air refused to enter, every breath a sob, every second was like a knife. Hands clutched her face, her hair, anything to keep from shattering. The ground swayed beneath her, heart pounding, vision tunneling. A scream built in her throat but never came, choked by raw terror. Tears burned her skin, the world blurred into panic and agony. She wanted to wake up, to undo it, to go back.

Beyond the chaos that consumed the entire city, tremors began to come from the ground, and they started to get stronger and stronger, I turned around looking at the beac and the to see what was happening untill he saw something that he'll never forget.

- Guys... GUYS WE NEED TO RUN RIGHT NOW.

I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name.

The beast had a deafening roar, teeth sharp as knifes, and claws big as swords. The monster didn't have no mercy it destroyed everything and everyone that was in his way, the city that once was a peaceful and a place fulfilled with joy and happiness now it was a victim of the greatest slaughter that ever happened.

 We manage to hid under a viaduct praying for no meteor to hit them. Theda didn't have no more hope nor happiness in her body, after everything she saw she just wanted to give up while Sue was comforting her, Nate was curled up in a blanket that he found.

- I can't believe this is happening, but I can't understand why this is happening.
 Nate said as he looks to the pictures of our first night that he took on his phone 

- OH HOHOHOHO I KNOW WHY, I DO I DO
 A beggar suddenly appeared from his tent and started to talk to us

- I ONCE WAS A PRIEST, AND I KNEW THIS DAY WAS NEAR AND GUESS WAS??? I WAS RIGHT, YES I WAS RIGHT ME ME

- What are you talking about?? you're just a crazy man who lives under a road 
  Micah said while wiping up his tears

- DIDN'T YOU JUST HEARD WHAT I SAID, I WAS A PRIEST, WE'RE WITNESSING THE FINAL JUDGEMENT DAY, THE SALVATION, THE APOCALYPSE, SEE, IT SAYS RIGHT HERE IN THE BIBLE 
  He pointed to the versicle that tells all the apocalypse story

- DO YOU CHILDREN REALLY THINK ALL THAT BURNING FORESTS, FLOODING AND THOSE DISASTERS WERE ONLY OUR FAULT, OH HOHOHO NOOO NO, THOSE WERE THE TRUMPETS, EVERY DAY SINCE THE DAWN OF OUR WORLD AN ANGEL PLAYED A TRUMPET AND SOMETHING HAPPENED, AND NOW THE FINAL ANGEL FINALLY PLAYED THE LAST TRUMPET AND WERE BEING SAVED

When the beggar said the word "trumpet" we froze, our faces turned pale, Micah started to tremble non-stop, Sue looked at Micah with such anger that she could killed him.

- YOU MOTHERFUCKER I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THIS
   Sue jumped into Micah's neck but Nate and I held her preventing from doing something crazy.

 - SUE WAIT IT'S NOT WORTH

- NOT WORTH??? CAN YOU HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING NATE , THIS FUCKING SON OF A BITCH IS THE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE END OF THE WORLD WE KNOW, HOW IT'S NOT WORTH??? THEDA DID YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FAMILY, IT'S ALL HIS FAULT

- GUYS, GUYS PLEASE I DIDN'T KNOW ALL OF THIS WOULD HAPPEN, I JUST- I WAS JUST PLAYING HOW COULD I KNOW A TRUMPET WOULD UNLEASH THE END OF THE WORLD, I'M SORRY I'M SO SO SORRY

Micah went down on his knees and started to cry his eyes out until seven shining beings appeared on the sky in a parable, everyone started to look at the sky terrified again, the beings started to talk in unisound

- Seven trumpets, seven angels, seven heavens, the human kind has been corrupted by sins and filled with pernicious and profane actions and thoughts. But be not afraid, the purification time is finally here, He's gonna set everyone free, THE SAVIOR IS COMING THE SAVIOR IS COMING THE SAVIOR IS COMING THE SAVIOR IS COMING.

The last words of the seven angels echoed through the whole world everyone heard it like thousands of loud voices inside their heads and it didn't stop, the humanity was doomed, the final omen has came to the planet earth. When we finally understood what was happening we finally understood what was about to happen, we hugged each other, but when I looked at the sky I've saw something I've never thought I would see in my whole life, It was God Himself.

He descended, the sky tore, and the earth rotted beneath His steps. His form was a shifting delirium, impossible to comprehend. The air buzzed with whispers that tore sanity apart. His gaze didn’t see—it consumed. He didn't said a word, the only thing He did was snap His fingers and the Earth was ripped in half, a massive crater emerged and from that crater an unimaginable amount of fire and lava began to spew and gush. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.

But as the seven angels said, humanity was filled with profanity and wickedness, no one on earth had their name written in the Book of Life, nobody could be saved and live in heaven. God shook His hand over the entire planet Earth, and every single human being fell into the lake of fire as punishment for their evil deeds.

That was the end of the whole human kind, all the wildlife and vegetation burned for centuries without ceasing, the whole world was doomed, Because of human actions. But now, no evil shall ever reign in the Kingdom of God again, the world was saved and purified through the glory of the Lord.
