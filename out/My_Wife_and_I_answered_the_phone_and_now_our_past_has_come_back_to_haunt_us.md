Part I: The Phone Call

Humans are creatures of lingering regrets. We constantly think of the things that we didn’t do, the opportunities we missed out on, the alternatives to the choices we have made, and the haunting question of “what if”. I am no different. I have a “what if” that persists in my head like a broken record. It lingers in the darkest recesses of my mind like a cockroach. It is a question that comes with a burden that rivals Atlas maintaining the weight of the heavens on his shoulders.

What if we had just come forward with the truth? 

The answer to that question is buried in a story that is not for the faint of heart. What I am about to describe is just as much a detailed recollection of events as it is a confession. Allow me to wash my hands of these sins and repent for I have seen Hell, and I need you to believe me that I have seen it.


The room was painfully quiet, almost as if time itself had stopped entirely. Darkness cloaked the room like a massive blanket as I lay next to my wife Jane. A faint light creeped in through the window, allowing for little visibility of the various pieces of furniture in the bedroom. My eyes scanned the room for a moment for any anomalies before resting my gaze upon her. She was still sound asleep, her breathing rhythmic as she continued to dream in peace. Her arms were wrapped around me lightly like vines on a tree trunk. I slowly wiggled free from her grasp and rolled on my side. I was still in a dazed state, my eyelids fighting a losing battle to stay open as I became self-aware of my heart beating against my rib cage. It thudded rapidly, like I had just been engulfed in a nightmare. 

I couldn’t remember if I had been dreaming or not but it must not have been important if I couldn’t remember, right? That’s what I told myself as I closed my eyes and wrapped myself back into the sheets like a cocoon. 

I lay still for a while, waiting for sleep to overtake my conscious. When it seemed as though I was about to doze off, my cell phone that was on my night side table began to ring, lighting up like a Christmas tree. The vibration of the device buzzing on the table grated my eardrums as I let out a groan of frustration. I sluggishly reached out and silenced the phone without even acknowledging who it was. I turned to my wife to see if she had stirred at all but thankfully to my delight, she had not been ripped from her slumber. I breathed a sigh of relief as I looked at the time, 3:03 am. 

“Give me a break.” I muttered irritably to myself as I turned back over hoping to get some sleep. The idea of having to go to work on just a couple hours of sleep was not a pleasant thought. The last thing I wanted to do was daydream about dreaming. I closed my eyes and tried my best to silence my thoughts but not even a moment after I had nestled into the warm embrace of the sheets, the phone rang again. My eyes shot open and I lunged out into the void of darkness to silence the phone. 

“Good God, can I just get some rest?” I buried my head under the blanket and face planted into the pillow, not wanting to think, see, or hear anything until 6 am sharp when I absolutely had to be awake. The sound of my phone going off seconds after my face connected with the pillow indicated that someone was still trying to get in touch with me. I begrudgingly lifted my face from the pillow and squinted to look at my phone which shone like a beacon of light on the bedside table. 

I exhaled angrily as I yanked the phone from its place on the table and stared down at the screen. My heart immediately sunk as I read the name of the person who was vehemently blowing up my phone. Grace. Surely this was a different Grace, but then again, how many Grace’s did I know that would be calling me at three in the morning? I hit decline on the call and not even a second after I did, the phone began to ring again. 

This person doesn’t give up, I thought as I pressed decline call. The phone lit up and hummed violently as Gracie continued to call again and again. I promptly kept declining the calls as they came through and I was able to eventually block the person, resulting in a blissful silence falling upon the room. I gently placed the phone back down and was about to lay back down when I noticed Jane sitting up, looking at me in pure confusion.  In the midst of all the chaos, I neglected the fact that the constant noise of my phone and I would have woken her.

“What is going on?” She asked as a yawn escaped her lips. 

“Nothing Jane, it was just some stupid scam caller or something. I took care of it.” I reassured as I returned to my place beside her in the comfort of our bed. As soon as she and I began to get comfortable, the familiar humming sound filled the air indicating that my phone was going off.

“Apparently you didn’t.” She quipped as I snatched the phone from its resting place and messed with its settings. 

I was perplexed. I had blocked this person, so how was the same number calling? I decided to take matters a step further and turn my phone off. I held the power button on my phone and watched the brand logo light up on the screen before dimming and blacking out completely. 

“There. Now I did..” I breathed a sigh of relief as I returned to Jane’s side and gave a light smile. “That was way more complicated than it needed to be.”

We shared a laugh as we both lay on our backs and snuggled together under the sheets. 

“I noticed. Seems like you got a stalker.” She teased as she wrapped her arms around my torso and placed her head on my chest. 

“Who wants to stalk someone like me though?” 

“I don’t know, you tell me?” She raised her head to look me in the face and raised a slight brow jokingly. 

In that moment, I wanted to tell her the person’s name but decided it was better to withhold the information. The name Gracie was all a coincidence, there’s no need to bother her with something as small as that in the grand scheme of things.

Before I could give a reply to her question though, my phone rang yet again. This time Jane and I both sat straight up in bed, immediately alarmed at what we were hearing.

“You…you turned that off right?” She asked with a  concerned tone, her face peering over at my bedside table.

“Yeah! I…I turned the phone off. Did you not see me turn the phone off?” I felt like my arms weighed a thousand tons and my fingers shook as I took the phone and brought it to my face. I stood there and just stared at the brightly lit screen, the name Grace striking fear into my heart. 

“Gracie? Who is this Graceand why is she calling you? It’s three in the morning.” Jane said, clearly agitated and suspicious of the fact that another woman was calling me in the early hours of the morning. 

“I don’t know, but I’m going to answer and figure out what the meaning of this is.” I pressed accept on the phone call and brought it it up to my ear.

“Listen, I don’t know who you think you are but-“ I was interrupted by a burst of static that sounded like a radio trying to find a proper frequency. 

“Hello? Is anybody there?” I asked as I glanced over my shoulder at Jane who appeared to be a nervous wreck. She looked how I felt internally, I needed to be strong for her. I didn’t want to look scared, but it was hard not to be. This whole thing was certainly strange..

“Put it on speaker.” Her voice trembled with a worried tone. I nodded my head and pulled the phone away from my ear. I pressed the speaker button and we both listened with racing hearts as the static continued to blare. This noise persisted for a while before a faint voice crept through.

“Hello?” The voice was weak but there was no mistaking it, someone was on the line.

“Yes? Hello? Who is this? How did you get my number?” The questions poured out of me at a rapid fire pace as I was trying to rationalize the scenario we found ourselves in. There was no response to anything I asked and instead we were left to listen to the static deafeningly sounded from the speaker. The moments we spent waiting for a response seemed to drag on in dog years but eventually the voice returned, this time much clearer.

“This..is…Grace.” I felt my blood turn to ice. Every word pierced my skin like a hunting knife as I looked over at Jane who shared the same horrified expression as myself. I felt my grip loosening on the phone as the world seemingly spun around me. This couldn’t be real, none of this is real.

“Leave us alone!” Jane’s voice broke the silence between the two of us. She seized the phone from what little grasp I still had and tried to decline the call. No matter how many times she attempted to hang up though, the call would not end. If anything, the static sound got louder and louder forcing Jane and I to cover our ears. As quickly as the static noise raised itself to ear-piercing decibels, it stopped. 

Jane and I were afraid to breathe as we listened to the phone for any signs of life besides our own. I could feel my limbs trembling from the fear and adrenaline and I was afraid to move in any capacity. I clenched my eyes shut and prayed for this to end. I could feel Jane’s face hovering above my shoulder and I could hear her trying to stifle cries of terror. This silence on the other end of the line was somehow more deafening than the static coming through just moments ago. It was not to last however as the voice returned and spoke clear as day from the other end of the line.

“I want answers.” The voice demanded in an aggressive rasp before the phone call suddenly ended and the screen went to black. Jane and I sat in the darkness, paralyzed by our own fear. We weren’t sure of what to make of what had just happened. It was like a piece of fiction had come to life. There was nothing fictitious about this however. This was the gravity of the situation coming crashing down upon us. There was a reason why that name sounded so familiar and the voice on the phone all but confirmed my suspicions. Jane and I locked eyes in horror and I felt myself shiver at the revelation. 

It was Grace, our daughter we had killed ten years ago.
