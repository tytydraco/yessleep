Hey, so… I don’t even know how to start this. I’m not a writer or anything, and I’m honestly not trying to make this sound dramatic. I just don’t know who else to talk to. Maybe someone here has experienced something similar?

My partner (Emma) and I have been together for like 4 years. We live together, things are mostly good. But we fight, you know? Nothing abusive or anything, just regular couple stuff. Miscommunications, little resentments, stress. But we noticed we kept forgetting how arguments actually went down. Like, one of us would say the other twisted things or misremembered what was said. It was getting frustrating.

So a couple months ago, we had this idea, kind of from therapy podcasts, I think? We agreed to record arguments when they got heated, so we could listen later and talk it out more calmly. Not in a creepy way, it was mutual. No editing, no deleting. Just… being accountable. Seemed smart at the time.

It actually helped a bit in the beginning.

Then, about two weeks ago, we had this fight about laundry. I forgot to switch loads again (yeah, I know), and Emma got mad, said I “always do this shit” and leave things half-done. I got defensive, she got more upset, whatever. I hit record on my phone around the halfway mark and we just… kept arguing for like 20 minutes. Nothing wild, just tense and kinda mean.

Next night, we sat down to listen back like we’d been doing.

I swear to God, what we heard on that recording was not what happened.

My voice was off, like it was me, but… flat. Cold. I sounded weirdly calm the whole time, even when I know I was pissed. And Emma’s voice… I can’t explain it. It wasn’t how she talks. It was so harsh. Like she hated me. She said stuff she’d never say. Things that don’t even make sense.

At one point she said something like, “You’re just like your father. Weak.”
She doesn’t talk about my dad. She knows he left when I was a kid. We’ve never talked about it in detail. She wouldn’t say that. She swore she didn’t.

I thought maybe I opened the wrong recording or something? But it was timestamped correctly. It was the right one. It was the only file recorded that day.

I tried to forget it. Chalked it up to stress. Bad memory. Glitch? I don’t know.

But a few nights ago, it happened again.

Different argument. This time I recorded the whole thing from the start. It was about work stuff—Emma was venting, I gave advice, she snapped at me, said I always try to fix instead of listening. It escalated. Not yelling, but close.

When we played it back… it was even worse than the first time.

The voices on the recording were us, but not. My voice sounded… condescending? Like I was talking down to her. Saying stuff I’d never say. And she just sounded broken. Not angry. Just… detached. Repeating the same phrases over and over like she was stuck. Stuff like: “This isn’t the first time,” and “We agreed. We agreed. We agreed.”

And there was something else. Background noise. Like whispering. Really faint. I thought it was interference, but when I scrubbed the file and boosted the volume, I swear it sounded like breathing. Or footsteps. Like someone walking in the room.

But we were alone. Just the two of us. No TV on. Nothing.

Emma left the next morning. Said she needed space. Went to stay with her sister. She’s barely texting me. I think she’s scared. I am too.

Here’s the part that’s really messing me up:

Last night, I found a new recording in the folder. It wasn’t there before. Timestamped two nights ago after she left. It’s over three hours long.

I didn’t record anything. I didn’t even touch my phone that night.

But when I played it…

We’re both in it.

Fighting again.

Saying the most hateful shit. Stuff I can’t even bring myself to type here. Like whoever’s talking wants to destroy us. And at the end, right before it cuts off, I swear to God, there’s another voice. One I’ve never heard before.

It says:

“Now we’re all caught up.”

I don’t know what the hell is going on.

I don’t know if I’m losing it, or if something’s messing with us.

I haven’t slept. I keep checking my phone. I’m scared to hear my own voice again.

If anyone’s ever heard of something like this… please say something.
