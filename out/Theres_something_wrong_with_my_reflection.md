It started small. A tiny flicker of doubt.

The first time I noticed, I was brushing my teeth before bed, half-asleep and running on autopilot. I turned my head to spit into the sink, and for the briefest moment, I thought—no, felt—that my reflection moved a fraction of a second too late.

It was so minor that I brushed it off. Maybe I was tired, maybe I had zoned out. But the next morning, it happened again. This time, I was shaving. I swiped the razor along my cheek, and out of the corner of my eye, I swore my reflection was just slightly behind. It wasn’t an obvious lag, just the faintest delay, like a poorly synced video. I tested it, waving a hand, shifting my head side to side. Everything seemed fine. Still, something felt wrong.

By the third day, I started paying closer attention. That’s when the little details started piling up.

My reflection blinked, but I was certain I hadn’t. I leaned in, studying my face, my pulse quickening. I tried to trick it—moving fast, then slow, making sudden gestures. Nothing. It was perfect. Too perfect. But every now and then, I’d catch it—an extra blink, a hesitation, a moment where its expression wasn’t quite mine.

Then, one morning, I caught it smiling.

Not a full grin. Just the ghost of one.

And I wasn’t smiling.

My stomach turned to ice. I stepped back, heart hammering in my chest. I stared at the reflection, willing myself to believe I had imagined it. I forced a grin, testing myself against the mirror. It copied me exactly. No delay. No smile of its own.

But I knew.

From that moment on, I avoided mirrors. I turned my bathroom mirror to face the wall. I kept my phone screen dimmed, barely glancing at it when I texted. Shop windows, darkened TV screens, even the gloss of my coffee table—I avoided them all.

But the more I avoided them, the more I felt it watching. Waiting.

On the fifth night, I woke up gasping, heart pounding in my throat. The room was dark, silent, but something felt wrong. A heaviness in the air. A pressure, like a pair of unseen eyes drilling into me.

Then I saw it.

My bedroom mirror had moved.

It was no longer bolted to my closet door. It stood, impossibly upright, at the foot of my bed. Angled just right so I could see myself lying there.

No. Not myself.

The thing in the mirror was already sitting up.

It wasn’t mimicking me. It wasn’t frozen. It was awake. Watching me. Smiling.

The terror that gripped me was unlike anything I’ve ever felt. My body locked up, every nerve screaming at me to move, but I couldn’t. I was paralyzed, staring at it, as it stared at me. Then, in the dimness, I saw it lift a hand.

I felt the cold rush of adrenaline, but before I could react—

The light flicked on.

I gasped, my body jerking as if I had been yanked from a nightmare. The mirror was back in its normal place. My reflection looked normal. My pulse thundered in my ears as I scrambled out of bed, chest heaving. But I know what I saw.

That was two days ago. I haven’t slept since.

And now? Now I think it’s getting stronger.

This morning, I forced myself to check the bathroom mirror. Just a quick glance. Just to make sure.

My reflection didn’t move at all.

It just stood there. Watching me. Smiling.

I don’t think I have much time left.

If you’re reading this, check your mirrors.

Make sure you’re still the one on the right side.
