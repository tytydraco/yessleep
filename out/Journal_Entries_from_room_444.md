Entry 171:
It happened again

Crash! The tsunami wave hit the hospital on the island, swallowing it with Poseidon's relentless hand surely taking it now with it to the depths. The memory haunts me again for another night still. I'll never know what took me away from my home, and the more I see. I will die here.

I ran from the storm. We all did. I don't know where they took us. The doors. Or why they even showed up with that storm in the first place. I haven't seen any of the others, my neighbors since being sent here. It's felt like years in this place. Maybe it takes all of us somewhere different? Different floors?This weird, endless hotel. But it's not a hotel. It's more like some island in-between what's wrong and what shouldn't be.

The center is an endless void. All the way up. All the way down.  I've seen countless jump down from their rooms over the railing. Who knows what happens to them. 

There's a population of its own in here. Some sort of weird grey people. All chanting weird things. Never sleeping. Sometimes yelling and screaming. Copulating. They congregate nightly on the bridge below on the 398th floor. My room is on 400's. 444. 

And the sickness. It infects the mind and body and soul and... everything I wreckon. Bloody slimy diarrhea like constant liver cirosis. Vomiting. And the TV. The programming. Nothing normal here. The last movie I watched was a monkey fighting the Kool aid man and ripping the juice mans nuts off. I miss home. I miss Pensacola. 




Entry 172:

My neighbor woke me up. The disease has created teeth like growths all over his body. His cirosis like symptoms already have his skin past the yellow stage. I  have small deposits of bloody baby teeth growths happening in the corner of my room now. I'm still the newbie but It really has been a while. 

I guess his TV went out during his show. His everyday. Every night all the time show. Some gorey deranged version of sesame Street. Big bird was about to finish the stigmata on Ernie when he said it just snapped and cut out. I don't know his name. But I can tell he was probably a nice older guy back home. 

I got dressed and went over to his room, I could tell it was after 10 pm because the folks down on 398 hadn't started their business yet. When I walked into his room, just like Ive done so many times before, my Spidey senses went off. Something new

There, in the kitchen was a figure. A weird, black, long long thing. Like it was trying it's best to keep every inch of itself hidden behind a corner but still peering just enough to make sure I caught it eyes and its smile, teeming with excitement. It was tall. Dark. And it had these weird three eyes. And such long long fingers. 

GIt's body was like vibrating static from its suppressed giggles. That long. Long. Smile. It struck my soul like the storm. Like it remembered it and was mocking me. 


Entry 173:

I'm thinking about jumping tonight.

 I ran out of my neighbors room and jetted down the hall. It turned my same adrenaline as if it were water under my feet.. Endless vibrating black. It felt like I ran right into its mouth. The hallways it's tongue some swaying water slide. Throwing me about it's halls like my legs were drunk but my mind was right. 

The laughing. It's mocking laugh like it was above me and below me and behind me all at once in that endless vibrating void. The Cheshire cat playing with alice.


I could see the other halls but it was almost like I was in this dark impossible water. Mocking me. My mind. 


Entry 174:

It's been a few days. I got back to my room somehow. I didn't know how long I was running. But I made it. My neighbors a good guy. His name is Randall. Hes from some town called Peoria. He told me about his time here. This is what I can jot down. I missed his voice. I'm sure I'll grow to miss it more. 

"I was a banker." Randall said.

"A damn good one. See where I'm from everyone knows each other. I helped folks get houses, then their kids and even sometimes their kids kids. It was a nice town.

Then it came. That awful storm. Those black things that ain't quite shadows. They drove us out. They drove us to those damn doors."

"You saw them too? I thought it was just us...what they hell are they? What is this place?"

"I don't think it's a place. It's a sick body and we're it's medicine. Some dying space that needs us. Our minds. Our bodies. We become the sickness in here."


"This has to be a dream man. It has to be."

"This dream has lasted 395 days for me son...and Ive grown accustomed to my food. The shows. The sickness. To these god awful things that don't make sense about this place. I'm becoming one with it just like you."

There was a loud growing sound. A thunderous rumbling shook us from our conversation. We ran out of the room. Every 4 walls of this tower. This hotel of sin and all that is awful began to come into itself. Like a closing throat all walls contracted and constricted close and the void started to create a pull. Like a vast flowing river. Poseidon's hand yet again calling. 

"Swallow me now!" Randall said...then jumped into the void. I could almost make out the black vibrating hands pushing him in. Smiling. Those never blinking three eyes. 


From below on 398 the bridge collapsed in on itself tossing some of the grey members into the voids vast current. They looked so happy. 
I ran back into my room. I will stay in here. I can feel his glare on me now through the blinds. I can feel the low hum at my door. 


Entry 175:

He finally left after 3 days or so.  Its like I can still feel his vibrations in my my bones. Shaking the sickness out of my backside. I've been living off all the leftovers from the daily food delivery. For some reason he never stops me from eating. Stranger still he hasn't been back at all. Just the low humming of the void outside my door.

The survivors of 398 have started making movements up and down the floors now. I'm not sure what they want but their mad ramblings and antics have turned into one concise laughter like chant. Like a pack of hyenas that only use one yip. Excited. Gurgling. 

I heard them break into a room near mine. Their choices seem random. I hear the screaming of their victims from hundreds of floors up. And hundreds down. And I hear their never changing bloodthirsty yowls. 


Just like I know the walls around me are collapsing on themselves and the void tightening, I too know that they will eventually come for me and they will hum like the big black monster that has haunted me and hunted my friend.


Entry 178:

The void has become thin like a small copper pipe. Everything is on top of everything the throat of the hotel closing. For some reason my door never opens when they pull and yank. They're thunderous in their delivery every time they try to break in to get me. Something in this place is helping me or maybe that's just The sickness taking me past the yellow stage now. To the greyness. I can feel them like my own heartbeat in my door. My window. My bed. It's like our eyes are both peeping over the curtain and meeting. I'm starting to laugh now. Because I know what my room means. And I know how to get out. Soon. I will jump. 


Entry 444:

Today. I jump into the void. Back home. 

Today I jump

This is a phenomenon being taken into scientific lense, and I believe it will be worth the investigation.
