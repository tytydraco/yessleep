You wanted to dig a hole to bury something in.

You're out in your backyard. It's snowing. The air shrinks your lungs and sticks your nose hairs together. It's a terrible day to be doing this but you read somewhere that the best way to age the piece of cheap metal in your pocket is to expose it to the elements. Bury it. Let the metal do what it does naturally. If you can pull it off, it'll be used in lots of projects to come.

You're about half a foot down when you get that weird sense that someone just spoke to you. You pause, foot on the heel of the shovel, and look around.

Someone is standing in the tree line about fifty feet away. You squint. You can't quite make them out. Their general shape is familiar, but not specific enough to attribute to anyone.

You try to remember if the neighbors were going to be out of town this week or the next. It's just you and them on this little dead end offshoot of the main road. The next closest home is on the other side of the copse of trees that the figure has, presumably, emerged from.

It must be someone you know. You raise the hand that's not ice cold around the shovel handle and wave, smiling.

The figure waves back.

"Morning!" you offer. "I can't tell who that is! Is that Rich?"

The figure is dressed warmly. Blue windbreaker. Snow pants.

They wave again.

Odd. You get a bad feeling. Are they scoping you out?

"Rich?" You call your closest neighbors name again.

Nothing.

"You okay?"

The person -- are they even male at all? you just assumed -- appears to open their mouth to speak. They cup their hands on either side.

And right next to your ear, as if spoken directly into the curved shell, you hear a voice.

"I'm not Rich."

You drop your shovel and sprint toward the house.

You can't hear it but you can feel it right behind you.

It's going to touch you.

You pound up the porch, skid inside the mudroom, and slam the glass door home, whipping around to yank closed the swinging plastic blinds.

The face pressed against the glass, staring back at you, is warped. Distorted beyond recognition. The eyes are melted and stretched and the irises, horse-brown, as long as those centers of those fucked up daisies you used to find, are focused right on you.

You force your thousand-pound arms to yank the curtains shut.

You sprint down the hall and as you do, you swear it's echoing back two sets of footsteps.

Did you remember to lock the door?

You fly into the coat closet at the end of the hall and slam-lock the door.

You bury yourself under mounds of stored goods. Ancient boxes gone floppy and coats and a beanbag chair and the vacuum.

You close your eyes, slam your hands over your ears, and wait.

Almost 24 hours later, your brother arrives, looking for you after a missed lunch.

He calls your name. He announces that your back door is wide open. He's scared.

How do you know it's him?

How can you be absolutely sure?

You hear him approaching the closet. You shrink back and the vaccuum topples.

He opens the door and says your name again, baffled. "What the hell are you doing? Are you alright?"

It's impossible to explain. The light flooding in is stark and cold and there is no one in this house except the two of you.

You pretend to wake up. You feign astonishment.

"What are you doing here?"

"What are YOU doing here?"

"I have no fucking idea. Did I sleepwalk?"

Your brother shrugs. He's staring at you.

You find yourself studying the shape of his eyes.

Maybe they're different than you remember.

You allow him to help unearth your gone-tingly body. Everything is cramped.

As you gather new clothes, change, prepare to leave with your brother, you cannot find a trace of any intruder. The back door open doesn't alarm you. The latch has been shot forever. It could have opened on its own. It doesn't have to mean anything.

Wouldn't it be easier to pretend nothing happened?

On the way to the car, you glance, with great trepidation, into the back yard.

The snow has erased any trace of what happened. No footsteps, no scuffs.

Your brother pulls out of the drive.

"Can I crash at your place tonight?" you ask.

"What? Why?"

"Dunno. Guess I could just use the company."
