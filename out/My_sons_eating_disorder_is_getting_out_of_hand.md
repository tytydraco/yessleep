The first time I noticed my son Theo was different was when I caught him eating a dead bird he found in our backyard. 

I pried open his bloody hand and discarded the remains, while he sat on the grass, unfazed by my horror. 

He was eight, and was losing his baby teeth. Kids normally have strange eating habits during this period, but not *this* strange. 

My wife and I took him to the pediatrician, who assured us that there was nothing unusual about his development. 

"Every kid expresses this phase differently," the doctor told us. "It’s just a matter of making him understand what’s appropriate and what’s not. He’ll learn." 

Well, he didn’t, despite our constant reminders of what was food and what wasn’t. 

One day, my wife couldn’t find him in his room and panicked, searching every corner of the house. She found him in the basement, eating what looked like a dead mouse, his expression blank and innocent. She noticed he was chewing carefully, as if adjusting to the gap left by his missing teeth. 

A week later it was another bird, this time larger. 

My wife, ever the optimist, accepted the pediatrician’s reasoning and took extra precautions to keep him away from animals. And it worked for a few weeks, but then we got an urgent call from his school asking us to come immediately. 

When we arrived, they informed us Theo had bitten a classmate’s shoulder so hard that he had nearly torn off a strip of flesh. 

To make matters worse, as the injured child was rushed to the infirmary, Theo remained motionless in his chair, indifferent, licking the blood from his hands. 

He got suspended until the school knew what to do. This incident left no doubt in my mind—something was truly wrong with him. My wife, now in tears, and I took him straight from school to a series of medical evaluations, from psychiatrists to neurologists. 

We needed to find out why he was doing those things. I even called the adoption agency that had placed him with us to check if his file had any listed conditions, but strangely, the number kept returning as nonexistent. 

We stayed at the hospital until late at night, with many of the test results expected the following day. 

Back home, we didn’t even know what to say to Theo. Should he be grounded? Lectured? Medicated? We had no idea. In his room, he went to play with his toy cars, appearing every bit the perfect little angel, unaware of any harm caused. 

His mother made him dinner and put him to bed, and even though he barely ate, his actions seemed just like the sweet and well-mannered boy he had always been. 

The next morning, I needed to get something done at work, agreeing with my wife that I would return as early as possible to help with Theo. But as I was driving, I got a call from one of the doctors who had examined him the day before. 

"Sorry to call you this abruptly. Can you talk now?" he asked, his voice concerned. 

I pulled over and said that I could. 

"I just sent you an email with the X-ray we took of Theo’s face yesterday, and we found something very peculiar. Can you open it?" he asked. 

On speakerphone, I opened the file on my phone and scrolled through a few images, not quite understanding what I was seeing. 

“Look at the second image,” he instructed, revealing an X-ray of my son’s teeth.

He explained most of them were embedded deep in his gums, unseen from the outside—normal for a child losing baby teeth, except they were far longer than they should be. His developing canines, in particular, were unusually large, extending high into his upper jaw, resembling something predatory, something… inhuman.

"You should bring him here now," the doctor warned. "I’ve gathered several specialists to understand what this is. We’ve never seen anything like it." 

I told him I would go right now and rushed back home, calling my wife repeatedly, but she never picked up. 

I burst through the door to see a scene I would like to one day be able to erase from my memory. 

Her body was laid on the floor, white as snow. Theo was crouched beside her, his mouth smeared with red.

He had bitten into her neck, tearing away a chunk, and was chewing it with the same innocent delight of a child enjoying a crisp apple.
