I am often reminded of the sweet smell of cotton candy, and children laughter filling the air on a crisp cool autumn night when that special day in October approaches yet again like it does every year.

Although 15 years ago on a cool October night that sweet feeling was quickly turned bitter, as that was the day I met him for the first time.

Halloween has always been my favorite time of the year, candy, trick or treating, more candy!! it's like a kids dream. It's funny how quickly dreams can turn into nightmares in a blink of an eye. It was 10th period and as always, I was counting down the final minutes to the last bell of the school day.

Gym had always been my least favorite subject in school which is why I am glad I always had it the last period of the day. I was drawing in my notepad while sitting on the bleachers when my friend Chirs bumped into me, "Hey man did you see how all those kids have been going missing in the next town over do you think our parents will let us go out this year" I looked up from my notebook and placed my gaze on to his.

"I don't know man where did you even hear that anyway it sounds made up" I said shaking my head going back to my drawing. "No man I heard some parents talking about it with the sheriff at town hall" I raised my head up again "Town hall what were you doing at town hall" He went to answer me when I placed my hand up to dismiss whatever he was about to say.

"Hey Chris, who is that over there" Chris turns away from me to set his attention on to the weird guy wearing a top hat and grey coat that was now just standing outside the school fence. "I don't know man why are you asking me" He replied "Because he" I stopped dead with my sentence as the man was now gone.

Me and Chris looked at each other and shivered as the school bell rang signaling the end of the school day. It was now Saturday and like every Saturday morning I was up bright and early, watching tv and eating my grandma's bacon and eggs that she took so much pride in making for me.

I was mid bite of a strip of bacon when the phone began to ring. "Honey, can you get that" my grandma said from the kitchen, "sure grandma" I said back mouth full of bacon. "Jackson residence" I said into the phone with a muffled tone. "James first of all stop talking with your mouth full and" "Oh hey Chris I began to say cutting him off" Chris sighed for a second "Are you done cutting me off" he said laughing.

"yes, I'm done" I said back now with a much better sounding tone as I had finally swallowed the piece of bacon I was chewing on moments before. "Ok and second have you checked your bag" "my bag, no?" I replied sounding confused. "Put the phone down and check it then come back and tell me what you found" Chris said now sounding anxious. "Ok hold on" I replied setting the phone down on the stand to go open my school bag.

I unzipped my bag and sorted through all the folders and books I had just tossed around in there before coming across something I did not recognize, it was a flyer but not just any flyer this flyer was an advertisement flyer.

I held the piece of paper in my hands for a few moments before reading it to myself, "Come one, Come all, Come and have a night you will never forget at Mr. Kline's Scare Fest. A one night only free scary experience for you and all your friends. And the best part is free admission."

I laughed out loud cursing myself for being such an idiot, I jogged back into the kitchen picking up the phone and placing it to my ear "Nice try Chris very funny you will have to try harder than that if you want to scare me."

There was a pause before I heard Chris's voice on the other line, "bro I did not put that in your bag I got one too why would I prank myself just to get you to believe it was real." For some reason the sound of his voice made me believe him. "You got a point alright so what do you think should we go?"

He paused again before responding, "the heck with it let's go what else is there to do right" "right see you tonight 8 o clock" I replied hanging up the phone. "Grandma!!" I yelled from the kitchen "can I go to a carnival tonight at 8 with Chris".

She looked at me as she strolled on into the kitchen hands on her hips "and who else is going to this said carnival" I thought carefully about my response "His dad will be there so it will be okay grandma" I said lying through my teeth.

"Well as long as there will be an adult with you guy's I don't see a problem with it" my eyes lit up with joy as she said this "thank you grandma you're the best". I said hugging her while pushing past her to the stairs to go get ready "You are welcome be home by 11:30 please no later" "Yes grandma" I yelled back from the top of the stairs.

7:30 came and I found myself sneaking out the backdoor with my cruiser bicycle, as I pedaled into the night towards Chris's house cool air beating down on my face, I could not help but feel so guilty that I lied to my grandma.

I arrived at Chris's house by 7:45 and he was already outside with his bike ready to go as I cruised up to the front of his house. "You ready" I said with a smile on my face "oh yeah it's going to be an awesome night" he replied back sounding more excited than me if that was even possible at this point.

As we got closer, we could see the lights and hear the music of the carnival. Me and Chris looked at each other and smiled as a rush of excitement filled our bodies. We approached the front gates where a man in a beat up looking striped shirt and baggy pants greeted us with a smile.

"Hello" he said with a smile "Hello" we both said in unison our excitement being replaced with a feeling of being a little creeped out. "Please, please, enter right this way we are so thrilled you have come to see us on this oh so special evening." the weirdly dressed carney said motioning us forward.

We proceeded through the gates to be met with almost a thousand screaming kids laughing, joking, and running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Me and Chris wasted no time running to the first ride which really did not have a long wait.

We boarded the Ferris Wheel with excitement all over our faces. "Wow look at that view." I said to Chris who was shoving his face with popcorn. "Yeah, I like it nothing but woods and streams for as far as the eye can see its truly peaceful" he said with a mouthful of popcorn.

"Dude how did you even get popcorn up here, more importantly when did you even grab it this is the first place we stopped" I said elbowing him in the ribs. "I just grabbed it right off the display when we came in." Chris said stuffing more popcorn in his mouth.

"You are ridiculous you know that" I said laughing as the Ferris Wheel came to the end of its cycle. "Where to now" I said glancing in his direction. "Bro I really got to go to the bathroom" I looked at him for a second and rolled my eyes "really man really" I said chuckling "Just go I will be right here."

Minutes went by and there was no sign of Chris I pushed open the bathroom door and walked in, "hello anybody home did you fall in" I said jokingly as I walked further into the bathroom. However, as I got to the last stall he was not there, now panicked I said, "man this is not funny if you're trying to scare me it worked now come out."

I turned to leave the bathroom when I heard the sound of a stall door creaking open behind me. "Chris?" I said turning around slowly. And there as I stood in that barely lit bathroom stood a man in a top hat, grey coat, and skeleton mask staring back at me from the end stall. I screamed as I turned and bolted out of the bathroom into the cool and loud night of the carnival outside.

"Ladies and gentlemen, may I direct your attention to tonight main event great extravaganza special."

Are the words that filled the night as I sat on my butt still staring at the bathroom, I just practically threw myself out of just to escape the uncertain death that awaited me if I stayed. I turned to face the main stage of the park where the same man that I saw on the other side of the school fence and bathroom was now standing proudly as if he just won an award.

"Ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining me tonight for this special occasion I am Mr. Kline" as he said this his eyes locked with mine and for the first time all night I was scared. "We have a very special guest tonight we want you to put your hands together and give it up for Chris Morison".

My eyes shot up to the blanket Mr. Kline was pulling off the object that I soon realized was a cage holding my friend Chris inside.

I turned away in disgust as I saw my friend's face slashed with tiny cuts and his clothes riddled with blood. "Chris here has been a very bad boy you see he decided to deface our beloved carnival didn't you Chris" Mr. Kline said turning towards the cage.

My heart sunk when I heard Chris's plea for help echo through the night unanswered. "But you weren't alone were you Chris, no, no you had help oh and would you look at that I think I see the culprit right there." Mr. Kline said pointing through the crowd and directly at me.

My heart sunk as everyone's gaze turned and met mine, "I didn't do anything" I screamed turning around to run for the gates. "Get him he must be held accountable." Mr. Kline said still pointing his finger directly at me.

I ran and ran until I finally collapsed hitting the ground hard as I gasped for air. I rolled onto my back and sighed in relief as I realized they were no longer chasing me, my relief was soon over when I realized Chris was still with those freaks and I just knew I had to get to the police.

I forced myself to my feet and began walking until I heard the all too familiar sound of police sirens approaching from behind me. I spun around panting for air as I told the sheriff everything that happened.

The police arrived where I said it was but there was no carnival when they arrived just another empty lot with no signs of life. I got home well past 11:30 that night and of course my grandma had already heard but I do not believe she actually believed me.

The sheriff's department and neighboring police departments searched for Chris for days, but no clues were ever found on his where abouts, or where he could have gone. They called off the search for him about 2 years later when they found his shoes and his bag in a dumpster outside of town where according to their police department a similar kid under similar circumstances went missing as well.

I spent the next few years searching the web for Mr. Kline's Scare Fest of course I never found anything but an old blog from 1922 with a newspaper clipping reading,

"Man dies after a tip led police to Mr. Kline's Scare Fest Sunday afternoon alleging the man behind 22 kidnappings in 5 county's was held up there, a shootout with police soon began after they arrived, and Mr. Kline was shot dead on scene."

It has been 15 years and I still see his face in my dreams those hollow eyes no soul shakes me to the core even thinking about it. I still miss you Chris and hope you come home one day but I know deep down you're gone forever stay safe my friend.
