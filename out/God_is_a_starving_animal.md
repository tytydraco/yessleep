I'm a man who has spent a lot of life with my nose in books. I have learned the philosophies of man and the storied religions from every corner of the globe. I've devoured the words of the prophets and the doctrines of guidance. It is all total horeshit. Organized religion, Spiritual practice, witchcraft and even whack job fringe cults. Not a single one of them got it right. I found the truth and It wasn't written on paper.

An icy road and a drunk driver catapulted me into my hunt for the truth. The car's blaring horn faded into the steady beat of a heart monitor. When I woke up I was an orphan, when I managed to walk again it was into Saint Katherine's home and school for boys. There was no one to mourn my parents but me. There was no funeral. Only a priest to give me two boxes full of ash. What the sisters attempted to teach me with the flat end of a meter stick was beaten out of me by the older boys. I wanted my parents. I needed to know why they never came back to see me.  

I would be fetal on the cold ground, crying for them to come back and save me. I was told repeatedly that 'My parent are up in god's kingdom.' or "In the ugly boxes under my bunk.' Neither was an answer. My parents were dead and they never came to check on me. Not as ghosts, and not as dreams. They weren't in those boxes. All those were, were two cardboard boxes full of grey powder. My years of abuse in that place turned  me from a jaded young boy to a bitter man. I found the truth in my early thirties. I spent many years as a crewman aboard cargo ships. The pay was mediocre but I didn't want the money. These jobs took me far and wide and I was able to interact and learn from various diverse cultures and every teaching they'd be willing to give me. 

It was winter, and we were docked in the North Atlantic. The rest of the crew and I had a few days of downtime due to a catastrophic failure in the anchor's chain winch. I returned from a service with the local faith healers. They taught nothing. I prattle of nonsense, combined with the excision of a handful of chicken gizzards from a sick elderly woman. I returned the ship disappointed, but used to the bite of being left empty-handed and still hungry for answers. On my return, I was offered a valuable experience.   from a fellow crewmate and almost friend. Zayven. He was from Singapore, He and I shared a similar upbringing. While I turned my tragedy into a hunt for answers. His turned him towards drugs and other means of stimulus. 

He handed me a half-crumpled water bottle full of random-looking roots and dark amber liquid. it was the color of piss after a night of binge drinking. Ayahuasca he told me. If I wanted to find heaven, and see god he told me this was how. I was not against using psychedelics. I tried mushrooms and even LSD in the past. I spent time in a Children of Mycelia branch for a while and they loved their psychedelics, I still get flashbacks from time to time. I drank the disgusting liquid it tasted of licorice and cat shit. It wasn't long before I began what they call "The Purge." 

My stomach convulsed and my head spun. I began to vomit and vomit and vomit. Everything inside me, followed by everything I ever thought of eating. I began to feel the colors of the world around me. I felt them rush through me into the center of my skull where it began forming a violent heat till it pierced through to my forehead. My third eye tear itself open to see the evening light.  At this moment My body contracted one more time, and I fell overboard. 

I couldn't feel any sensation besides cold. I didn't know I was drowning. Hell I didn't even know I was wet. I Took a back seat to my own body, it was surrounded in murky darkness. But I was free. The colors of light that penetrated my mind gave way and danced around me  till they were almost tangible and pulling at me. My physicality sank further and further and further. I realized I was being pulled from it, but it was okay. I knew it was I was calm and at peace. I thought what could be to come. I thought of my parents. 

The muddied depths gave way to light as my spirit broke through the water's surface. I saw the ship, and seconds later I witnessed  my fellow crewmates diving into the water after my body. I rose above ship, towards the horizon. It was beautiful. No better place to die than a sunset. I scanned around me I saw the dock, I saw the cities, across the water and the land I could see other gorgeous ribbons of light all heading towards the sky. Some were close by and others had to be thousands of miles away. Other souls all making the next steps in their journey. 

Quickly now, past the birds, above the mountains, and beyond the clouds we arose until we pierced through the day into the eternal night sky. The stars were  beautiful at eye level.  Thr ribbons of light penetrated through the entire globe. They began to twist and converge into a single braid. I could almost make out other faces in the ribbons. They all looked so at peace. I was excited to finally have answers. I looked ahead towards where the trails of light terminated. I gaze forward to the heaven man was never meant to see. 

I saw god. 

There above us. He was a writhing mass of energy and color. Fleshy tendrils of light that weaved their ways through it's form. Slithering  and enveloping eachtoher amassing this continent sized behemoth. the ribbons of color our souls were locked in were being pulled into it's spiraling Maw of eternity. I would have cried if I was able to. The closer I got to the other souls, to their energy. That Their faces had not changed. They held blissfully ignorant smiles of solmenity. They could not see the monster before us inhaling us into it's celestial gaping throat. Man was not meant to witness god. Not a single teaching of faith spoke of the animal we were about to feed. 

I was suddenly tugged to a halt, my energy stood still as I watched the  others continued towards their end. I didn't know what net caught me but I was grateful  for it. I was being pulled away from this nightmare. I was grateful and I was so happy. I cared not if I was being ripped to straight to the river styx. Anywhere that wasn't being consumed by this entity's gullet. The further I got from him the more thankful I was. I began to pray and thank a god for saving me. That's when it turned one of it's texas sized eyes to mine. God looked directly at me, with a gaze of hunger. 

It's eye never left me the entire way I was wrenched from him. I was being pulled faster and faster and it watched me the whole time. All at once everything went white. My ears ringing was the first sensation that returned to me, before the burning in my lungs and taste of salt. I choked up water, and could hear everyone around me cheer. As soon as air reentered my lungs it came out as a scream that didn't end for hours. 

I saw god, and it's starving.

I quit my job  and persued a new field of study. My parent's were gone and digested by it. I accepted that truth and began the hunt for what this god above really is. I came up with nothing. Books, libraries. Priests, shamans, and forums. Not even the internet had a single answer or experience close to mine. Not a single fucking thing. I researched for years and came up short on every avenue I searched. I came close on a forum I can’t disclose here. They described the ribbons to me, the feeling of the pulling. It was close. When I went to answer his comment the post was removed. I tried to repost it, I tried to find the commentor, but it was all lost. 

A few days later is when I met the men who want to kill god. They told me everything I had ever wanted to know. It came to our planet from beyond the stars and made us in it’s image. It made us out of it’s own energy and bits and pieces of the creatures that already existed below. It created mankind as a vessel to foster the right energy to sustain itself. The human soul. 

An entire history of violence, breeding, and war kept it nice and fat for a long time. It’s existence was discovered by taiwanese researchers in the middle of world war two. Which also led to the biggest observable change in it’s form to date. All of that manmade pain and suffering made their spirits plump and greasy. All those poor souls made god bloated and strained. This led to plans. This led to ideas. The first try was to starve it out. This was done with the advent of television broadcast and even more effectively the onslaught of the internet and wifi, they create a wave like net that captures escaped souls and shreds them to nothing. This has done tremendous work in phase one to start starving it out these last decades.  

Phase two is to begin in four years time. The next step is to overfeed it all all at once. On april 30th 2029 all broadcast signal on the winter half of earth will cease. Two million lives will be lost in a mass casualty event scheduled at 06:00 hours UTC. Their lives will be all be lost at the exact same instant sending god the psychic gravy train that’ll rupture it’s being and set our species free. We are going to put an end to the Godhead, and save our souls.
