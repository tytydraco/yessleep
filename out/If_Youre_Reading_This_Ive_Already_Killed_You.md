You ever get one of those chain e-mails; the ones about a girl named lucy who hung herself and if you don't send it to thirteen other people then she'll appear in your room at 3am and kill you? You probably shake your head and laugh it off right, who even comes up with that stuff.

Yeah I thought that to.

 It began as any other workday. I was sitting in my office hunched over my computer scrolling though the web. It had been a slow week; I had gotten ahead on my paperwork by three. So now I was just running out the clock until I could drink myself into oblivion for two days. 

Clearing out my spam folder was about as close I could get to actual work that day, so I decided what the hell. After clearing out countless phishing emails and invites to chats with single moms, I came across an email with the subject line:

**If You're Reading This, I've already killed you.**

Now it wasn't the title that piqued my interest, it was the sender. It was Sam from down in accounting. Sam was a decent enough guy, a real whizz with numbers and he had joined me once or twice on my weekend binges. He never struck me as a chain-mail prankster, especially one as morbid sounding as this.

Curiosity got the best of me, and I opened the e-mail. 

Immediately I was hit with a black screen, and my blood boiled over with annoyance. I was getting ready to call the IT desk when my screen popped back to life. The email was full screen and said this:

**If You Are Reading This. I Have Killed You.**

**Maybe you would have been safe had you deleted the email.**

 **Billie will come for you tonight**

**She likes to play with her food**

**Survive her games for three weeks and you'll be free**

**Or send this to thirty people and share your fate**

**The clock is ticking**

**And she is coming.**

The text was crimson red and the font dripped and oozed; like it had been written in blood. The borders of the e-mail were styled to be crinckled and torn, someone had spent a lot of time slaving away on it. 

A bit more foreboding than I am used to, that's for sure. I deleted the e-mail and sent one to Sam asking what the hell he was smoking. Within 15 minutes I heard a faint knock on the door. 

"Can I come in?" Sam's voice meekly crawled from outside the door. 

"Course," I said bewildered. Sam wandered in, quietly shutting the door behind him. He was disheveled to say the least. His shirt was untucked, a patchy five o'clock shadow puckered his face, and he looked like he hadn't slept in a month. He quietly sat across from me, clearing his throat.

"Scott did you-uh-did you read that whole thing?" Sam squeaked. 

"Of course. Did you send that to anyone else, I think it's kind of amusing but if Benson finds out he'll have your ass." I laughed. Sam didn't join in, a look of guilt hung over him. My chuckling died down as I began to shift in my chair. 

"I'm so sorry. I didn't think you'd actually read it; I was desperate," Sam proclaimed. I scoffed at him, he was being dead serious.

"Your commitment to the bit is impressive Sam-" I began but was quickly cut off by his sudden outburst.

"It's not a fucking bit!" He shouted. Office drones from the outside perked up their ears and looked in. I got up, quickly shutting my blinds. Sam continued his ranting. 

"You'll think I'm nuts but it's real. I see her everywhere; I've had to barricade my bedroom door at night. She waits outside taunting me, saying it won't stop her for long. Last night I woke up with this on my arm." he rolled up his sleeve to reveal a deep gash running up his forearm.

"Oh Christ, that looks infected." I gagged. 

"She could have killed me, she got into my room somehow, but she let me live. She wanted me to send those e-mails, she wants to spread it was the only way," He continued to plead. 

I looked down on him with pity. We have had a busy quarter, and I know he's been working like mad to meet the deadlines. I put a hand on his shoulder, and he flinched away like I was a leper. He got up, backing away slowly.

"Sam just calm down," I ordered.

 "Just send it to thirty other people and you'll be fine." He forced a smile.

"I already deleted it. Hate those dumb things you always get a bunch of spam cluttering up your inbox if you do it." I explain. The smile faded away from his face and was replaced by a look of dread.

"Then lock your door at night, stay awake and look out for her." He finally replied. He rushed out then, muttering another slew of apologies under his breath. 

He got a bunch of strange looks as he ran out my door, tanking his office rep for sure. I threw my hands up in the air, flabbergasted at it all. Thinking he had just lost it a bit, I went back to pretending to work.

In hindsight, I should have listened.

That night was the first, and it was the worst. I got home around 530 and heated up some microwave dinner slop in lieu of a homecooked meal. I parked myself in front of the tv and watched *Sopranos* for the 50th time. 

Tony was yelling something about a bird feeder when I heard a massive crash from my room. I sprung up like a jackrabbit; hurrying to find the source. I came to my bedroom to find my bookshelf had collapsed, novels and trinkets strewn about everywhere.

I sighed, thinking that maybe I had just overstocked it or something, when I heard a cackle behind me. It sounded like a little girl sniggering at some schoolyard prank. 

Bewildered, I turned around to see something sprint down my hall; the pattering of tiny feet following it. I rushed out to find nothing, the noise ending as suddenly as it began. Two rooms away; I heard my tv click off with a sudden thump.

The only sound that remained in my apartment was the lowly hum and rattle of my fridge. I made my way back, listening for the pitter-patter of little feet. 

*SLAM*

I jumped, twirling around. My bedroom door had slammed shut.

*SLAM*

The bathroom door.

*SLAMSLAMSLAM*

The rapid-fire beats of playing the cabinets like percussion instruments. Panic began to sit in as the rational part of my brain struggled for an answer. The only thing I could think of was someone was playing an elaborate joke on me. 

The more I thought about it, the more sense It made. Some sick practical joke Sam and his account buddies had cooked up. I was going to slap him upside the head next time I saw his sorry ass-

That train of thought was derailed as a sharp pain slid across my thigh, a shrill giggling ringing out as I cried.

I buckled under the weight of pain and clenched my thigh. I took my hand away to reveal the crimson stain of red that was beginning to pool. I limped to the counter scrambling to find some sort of cloth or paper towel to stop the bleeding. 

I rummaged around my kitchen sink, a slight snickering hanging in the air. It was a teasing laugh, playful yet full of venomous intent. I looked up, facing the window overlooking the street. Out of the corner of my eye I saw it.

It was a little girl hunched over onto of the fridge. She was perched there like a gargoyle, Eyeing me though dirty bangs. She wore a long yellow raincoat, and her skin was pale and ghostly. 

She was twiddling her thumbs, a blood covered razor dripping my life onto the floor next to her. Her face was black and white, like it was covered in soot. I looked closer, and I saw it was actually black and white grease paint. She had painted it like a skull, a little reaper right out of a fairy tale.

She saw me standing there, a blood-soaked towel clinging to my leg. She broke out in a Chesiree's grin, and I felt an icy sting in my chest. The rational part of me still wanted to believe this was a prank.

"Who are you, what are you doing in my house?" I squeaked out. 

"My name is Billie. I just want to play with you for a little while," The girl retorted. Her voice was shrill and playful, like how a toy doll would sound. 

"Billie. Like the-god damnit I knew it, what are you like Sam's psycho niece or something?!?" I screeched at the snot noised little brat. Billie put her hands to her chin in a thoughtful expression. 

"Hmmm Sam, Sam- hh yes the last man I played with. He got boring and finally followed the rules." She pouted. "No one ever sees my letter anymore, it can get awfully boring." She broke out with another case of the giggles, and as the pain in my thigh throbbed, I was starting to get more than a little unnerved. 

"What do you want from me?" I questioned the demon child. She was all smiles now.

"How about hide and seek. You go hide, and I'll seek," She boasted. "Better not let me find you or-well why ruin the surprise." She cackled and readied herself. She eyed me like a predator and began counting down from ten in a monotone voice. 

Suddenly the whole situation felt very real, and I broke out of my stupor and ran out of the room as she got to a drawn out six.

 Where could I hide, realistically? I was six feet tall and kind of burly, we shall say. 

I thought back to what Sam had said this morning, lock my bedroom door and stay awake. I ran back to my bedroom door, closing it behind me in a hurry. It didn't lock on its on, I had to struggle to push the fallen bookshelf in front of it. 

I leaned onto of the thing, bracing myself against the door as well. Putting my head to the door, I heard nothing from outside. The only sound was my own ragged breathing.

Jesus I was out of shape.  It seems pathetic to be scared of a little kid probably playing a joke. Though if it was one, it had gone too far already. 

*taptaptap*

A soft knock on my door made me jump out of my skin. I repositioned myself as Billie let out an impatient sigh from outside. I hadn't even heard her walk around; she would have to make a noise when she leapt off my fridge. 

How the hell did she even get up there to begin with?

*taptapTAP*

More knocking followed by an exasperated thud against the door. 

"Gee Wizz I wonder where he's hidden," Billie brayed loudly from outside. I held my head in silence, foolishly hoping she wouldn't think I was in here. 

THUD.

The door shook with rage as Billie kicked it. A powerful show of force for someone her size. The doorknob started to rattle with anticipation. Again, I stood silent. 

"This is a pretty pathetic attempt at hiding Scott. It's like you don't even want to live. Then again, no family, no friends; alone in the dark watching old tv on a Friday night? Maybe ya just have nothing worth living for." Billie mocked cruelly. 

My heart sank as I slumped back against the door. She was hurtful but not too far off I suppose. She gave another halfhearted kick and the door shook limply. I heard thumping noises leading away from the door, Billie muttering angerly to herself. Sighing a breath of relief, I put my head in my hands.

I was going to murder Sam, I thought. I would take him out for a beer, slap him on the back and say there were no hard feelings. Then strangle him in a dank alley.

 Even then, I clung to the notion that it was "just a prank bro." It was naive of me to think that, stupid even. The alternative was too horrific to ponder. 

*clung-CLANG*

My head shot up. Dishes smashing to the floor it sounded like. 

I heard Billie laugh to herself, squealing and wooing like a drunken partygoer. As she broke my dinning ware I heard scurrying around the walls, scratching sounds. Like claws being sharpened as they skittered around. 

Then silence, like someone had placed a vacuum in my apartment. Foolishly, I put my head against the door, looking for any sign of my unwelcome guest.  Nothing, not a peep. 

*snikt*

A sharp pain in my left hand. I came away from the door to see a bloody kitchen knife busting outward from the palm of my hand. I yelped in agony and tore my hand away, scrambling away from the door all together.

 Billie was giggling on the other side; she slowly slid the knife out of the door. My hand was trembling, a clean cut but it ached like nothing else.

 I looked to the slash on my door. Billie's dull hazel eye stared back at me. It was a look full of loathing and disgust.

"Look at you. Curled up in a ball, cowering like a little baby," She spat, venom oozing with every word. "Killing you will be a mercy. We just can't have that, not yet anyway." She giggled. 

"What the fuck do you want from me?" I cried out in terror. 

"I want new friends, people who are fun to play with," she said plainly. 

"But-but I deleted the e-mail," I whimpered. 

"You'll figure it out. You're a clever little middle manager. If not, then well. . ." She trailed off. She disappeared from view, letting her threat linger in the air like a bad smell. 

A piercing sound, like nails rubbing against a sandpaper covered chalk board sprung up behind me. I winced, and turned around to see the sound was emitting from my bedroom window. 

I wished I hadn't.

Billie clung to the outside window. Her hands were curled like talons as she hung outside. Her face was almost the same; her smile contorted, full of jagged teeth. Her eyes were slit like a cat, yellow as the rising sun. 

She saw me gawking there and waved at me, then disappeared into the night. I stayed up the night balled up under my blankets like a child. The light in my room was on, and I jumped at every knock and noise in the night.

 I fell asleep briefly around 4am; and awoke to find a sticky note pasted to my head. It was a little smile with the words "*See you tonight*" written on them. 

Sam was right, she could have killed me any time she wanted. She just wanted to break me first.

I found the kitchen to be awash with debrief and glass. It was an absolute disaster zone.

That was the first night.

It has been a week since then, and it has only gotten worse. The following Monday I arrived to work to find the office drones gathered and chattering like old hens. The news around the watercooler was grim indeed.

Sam had been found dead late Saturday morning. He had hung himself. 

Ricky, also from accounting, claimed his brother-in-law was a cop and had told him they had found a note next to the body. The note claimed that Sam was overwhelmed with grief and couldn't live with his crimes any more.

 A bit dramatic I thought but I had lost my chance to gain any info on Billie.

The workday came and went, and I dreaded being home alone with her. Billie's torment continued, it was as mundane as a knock on the wall; to something horrid like throwing things at me or trying to stab me. 

Sometimes she would just enter the living room and collapse to the ground without saying a word. She would watch Tv, draw obscene pictures with crayon. She would show them to me like I would be proud. They would often depict a yellow eyed thing with fangs that was jumping rope or dismembering a family.

She would get this pouty look in her eye, kick me in the shin then run off to God knows where when I didn't respond to her drawings.

I haven't slept in a week. At night I sleep with one eye open, glued to the ever-growing barricade at my door. When I do doze off I find cuts and bruises on me. The cuts are getting deeper, the bruises more swollen.

I can't do another two weeks of this. I need it to stop. She just wants new friends, maybe even someone who will love her.

Yeah I'm full of crap for that last one, but she isn't going to take me.

I won't let her. 

So, I came up with an idea. What if the e-mail didn't have to be an email? What if I set her lose just by sending out a mass text or something like that. 

This might work. If it does, well better you than me.

So, remember:

**If you are reading this, I have killed you**

**Billie will come for you tonight**

**She likes to play with her food**

**The clock is ticking**

**She is coming.**
