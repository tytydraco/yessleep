Let me start by saying I grew up in a rather large town. It wasn’t the sort of place where everybody knew everybody, but it was the sort where you knew a fair few people. Oh, by the way, my name is Sarah.

In my town, people would go missing pretty frequently. I’d see missing posters plastered to signs, to poles, to windows. Every time the case went cold, every time the ones that went missing were never seen again.

As I got older, I noticed a more disturbing pattern to the missing posters. The ages of those who were missing always ranged from late teens to early twenties. So around seventeen to twenty three.

Now, when I was a little girl, I had the same thing drilled into my head time after time, “whatever you do, whatever you hear, DON'T go in the basement.” It was the one and only rule I had, and my parents made sure I knew it well.

I grew up scared of the basement, especially as a little kid. I didn’t even want to break the rule and see what was down there, because I’d hear muffled noises or banging. I went out of my way to stay as far away from the basement door as possible.

My fear was increased when I was playing outside one day when I was seven, and from the tiny, four by eight window in the basement, I suddenly saw a pale hand press against the glass. I freaked out, thinking that the basement was haunted by ghosts, and that’s why I wasn’t allowed into it. But the day would eventually come when I would find out what really was the case.

As I got older, into my tweens and then my early teens, a nagging curiosity started to develop. I was still pretty scared of the basement, as it was unknown, and odd sounds could be heard at all hours, though they had intermittent silences. I was still scared, but now a nagging curiosity took over me.

Well, one day when I was fifteen, my parents left me home alone so they could run errands. As usual, before they left, they told me that no matter what I heard, DO NOT go in the basement.

Knowing the errands they had to run, and that they wouldn’t be back for at least an hour and possibly two, I set my mind. Today was the day I was going to finally figure out what was in the basement.

As I approached the basement door, my hands started to sweat, and I felt the intense urge to run away. But, I knew that if I didn’t finally see once and for all, what was in the basement, I was never going to be able to make myself look. So, with trembling hands, I unlocked the basement.

The smell hit me first. There was a coppery smell, layered over the scent of bleach, ammonia, and other cleaning chemicals. Then the sounds. There was a muffled whimpering that had me almost abandon the basement altogether, as I didn’t think there should be anyone in there. I mean come on, my parents were out running errands, and I was an only child.

Gathering up the thin threads of my courage, I flipped on the light and slowly made my way down the steps, my heart pounding. What I saw still haunts me. At first, I noticed that the floor was covered in plastic, and there was a cross next to a photo album on the table, visible from the staircase.

As I reached the bottom step, I screamed. Tied to a chair in my basement, was a young woman. She wasn’t much older than I was. Clad in nothing but her undergarments, her body was littered with infected cuts, dried blood, and filth. As she looked at me with fear, I realized with dawning horror that I recognized her. She’s the eighteen year old from the current missing poster.

Next to her was a metal table, covered in all kinds of scalpels, knives, and other torture devices. Swallowing back the bile rising in my throat, I made a silent promise. I was going to get her out of there, before it was too late. The last thing I did before leaving the basement was check the photo album.

As I opened it to the first page, I leaned over and threw up, making a puddle on the ground. Inside were pictures of the torture my parents had inflicted. At first I didn’t want to believe it was them, but they stared out of the album with smiles on their faces, wearing black aprons and plastic cleaning gloves, blood splattered on them as they stood next to their victims. Every page was filled like that, with their victims in different stages of being tortured. And every victim was from a missing poster over the years.

I ran out of the basement and after throwing up again, I called the police. I was barely able to dial the simple three digit number due to how badly my hands were shaking. My parents arrived home moments before the police showed up. I watched as they apprehended my parents before going into our basement.

After seeing what all was in the basement and coming back out of it, they took my parents away. I ended up living with my grandma, a kind old lady.

I’m an adult now, with my own kids. To this day, I wish I had gone into the basement sooner. I could have saved so many lives.
