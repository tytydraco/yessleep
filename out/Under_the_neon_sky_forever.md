 I chose violet. The soft purple filled the sky. It was accompanied by a light brushing of amber that peeked in from under a dense arc of clouds. It was just as magical as I’d remembered, and if I was being honest, the vibrance and vividness of the hues made it all the more extraordinary.

The cabin in the middle of nowhere sat alone in the rising summer mist. The calm waters of the lake snaked around the home, nestled amongst the family of trees that followed the thin metal fence line.

It was all there, just as I’d requested. Just as I remembered.

“How does everything look?” The man’s voice crackled from above like static.

“Exceptional.” I felt a thin trail of drool running from my mouth. “The accuracy…it’s eerie.”

“Would you like to tour inside?”

I felt both the dew from the grass between my toes and the clammy leather cushion clinging to my back. The duality of being in two places at once was rather unsettling. 

“That won’t be necessary. I trust it’s just as expected.” I swallowed, “But can I see her?”

I stepped toward the rocky shoreline adjacent to the home and half-heartedly chucked a pebble into the stream. It sunk with a *bloomp,* and after a half-second of lag, the waves spread atop the surface. 

“I can show you her, yes.” 

I heard the cabin door creak open from behind me. Even from this distance, her smile radiated from the entryway, and as she took two steps onto the porch, I recognized her at once. I ran, the coarse pebbles of the beach pounding at my feet until the slick grass of the meadow carried me into her outstretched arms. 

“She feels warm!” I declared with a silly grin. Our heartbeats collided. She gazed back at me with her innocent green eyes, her sun-kissed cheeks, her golden hair gleaming and bouncing off her shoulders. “She is perfect.”

“I’m glad everything has sufficed.”

“Ava—what do you think, love?” I asked. “ It’s the old summer cabin in Whistler. Do you remember?”

She remained in my arms, her soft porcelain skin against mine. I pulled her away, temporarily. She blinked, her lips unmoved, her warm smile still plastered to her face.

“Ava?”

Still locked in our embrace, we glanced at the flock of birds gliding into the canopies of the nearby maple trees. They chirped a cheerful tune.

“The dialogue is not yet ready,” the voice said. “There are still some matters to address with your account. Once those are settled, the system will need time to analyze the data and formulate the proper speech patterns accordingly.”

“But…it will be ready?”

There was a pause before the words and the static sparked again. “If everything is addressed, it can be arranged.“

I took a deep breath as a wave of relief washed over me. “Okay. I’ve seen enough.”

In a matter of seconds, the world spiraled into an endless, black oblivion. I plunged into its twisted, inky depths with silenced screams of terror. After an agonizingly long period, I resurfaced on the other side—to the grey room and the leather chair. Chandry was removing the various cables and tubes, the adhesive still caked to my sweaty forehead. A steady hum reverberated from the walls. 

Once my breathing returned to normal, I asked Chandry what was next.

He rubbed his forehead. “On your end? There is still the matter of paperwork. I also require the proper reassurances.”

I rose from the recliner and followed the man to his desk. “As will I.”

He nodded as he rummaged through the top drawer of his desk. There was hardly a free space to write on with the stacks of file folders and binders collected on top. 

“Go on then, ask away.”

“How can I know for sure…regarding the longevity.”

He peered up from the pile of paper he was compiling. 

“It’s all in the contracts. A portion of the payment will cover the maintenance costs.” He nudged the stack towards me through the narrow avenue of empty space. 

I flipped through the papers, skimming through the documents and providing my signature in the appropriate areas. “And...security?” 

“The data is backed up and stored offshore. The servers are housed in one of our crypto-mining facilities. Off the grid. Untraceable.”

“And the data being compiled, will—”

“All cultivated to your liking.” 

When I reached the end, I slid the stack of papers back to him. He skimmed the pages quickly, signing the remaining empty slots. 

“And the trial?”

“Two weeks to the date,” I confirmed. 

“Understood.” He tidied the documents and placed them into a black folder. “Everything looks in order.” 

“Is there anything else?” I asked.

“Yes,” he responded, standing up from his chair and offering his hand. 

I grabbed it with a firm shake.

“I need to see it in your eyes.” He wouldn't let go. Instead, he pulled me closer. “Once we go through with this, that is it. There is no next times. No do-overs.”

I matched the intensity of his gaze. “I assure you, this is what I want.” 

We locked eyes a moment longer, then he released his stiff grip. “Very well, John. We will be in touch.”

\*\*\*

The next week slipped away like sand pouring from an hourglass. I tried my best to indulge in all of the simple pleasures that one could. The comforting touch of a woman. The view of the skyline from the tallest tower. The salivating taste of a Michelin star steak. The watching of people, busy, walking through the cobblestone streets of the plaza, hand in hand, laughing. Living life. I took in all of the things one takes for granted when ignorant of the harsh reality that their days are numbered. 

There still loomed the uncertainty and precarious predicament of it all. All of the regrets and indiscretions I had buried away all my life suddenly clawed their way back to the surface. The sour taste jostled me awake in the wee hours of the night. Something felt wrong. Could the process be trusted? While everything had seemed satisfactory, there was little guarantee of what was waiting for me on the other side. The path ahead was winding. 

But I would be free, I told myself. We would be free.

A couple of sleeping pills put me back at ease, and before long, I was back at the cabin.

\*\*\*

The call came in the dead of the night. I wiped the sleep from my eyes and relished the long, slow sips of my freshly brewed coffee. 

My hands trembled once they arrived. The three men were dressed tidily in dark suits. They strode in and inspected the place before collecting the sealed envelope I had prepared as well as a set of my apartment keys. I followed the group outside into a black van. 

Back at the office, Chandry welcomed me with a firm grasp. 

“Everything is set. Are you ready?”

I mumbled a feeble yes.

“Are you sure?” He looked worried. 

“Yes,” I repeated firmly.

He motioned to the familiar sofa. “Very well, then. Take a seat.”

I sat silently as he strapped me in, my teeth chattering uncontrollably. I watched the various apparatuses and tubes being inspected, connected, and inserted inside of me. The pricks from the needles caused me to wince, forcing me to look away. I focused on the humming from behind the walls. One man was monitoring the screen, the others clasped their hands together, patiently, standing at the far end of the wall. Waiting. 

“Okay, Mr. Billington. We are ready,” Chandry beckoned.

I studied the dark room with the blinking lights. The strange men stood emotionless. Everything felt so precise, so efficient. While I wasn’t ready to say goodbye, I doubted I’d ever be fully ready. After a moment of hesitation, the words fell from my lips:

“I’m ready.”

A flip of the switch and the humming of the fans intensified from the backroom. The motors roared like a turbine engine of an aircraft. A script of code began to dance on screen. The man at the computer fought to keep up, typing feverishly. Suddenly, a sharp, piercing sensation seared at my temples. The wires that sat on my head in a squishy, delicate membrane began to illuminate. They began to ignite. 

“As discussed, the interweb neural link has been set up,” Chandry said. “Full access to the internet. You know how to get in touch.”

There was a flurry of final thoughts that flooded my mind. Most I managed to stifle, but a question remained that had nagged at me that final week. It was irrelevant given the time frame, but the very idea made me shudder:

*What do they do with the body?*

I sunk into the black abyss. The rapid fall brought with it a hellacious, dipping sensation in my stomach that made me writhe and howl with terror. When I’d thought it would never end, I awoke with my back in the soft grass of the meadow. The fixed sunrise stared back at me,  glowing in its glorious purple. I sat up and watched the trees sway peacefully with the breeze. The cabin was only steps away. I approached, noticing that I was here and only here–the splitting of my consciousness had vanished. I was left with just the feeling of the soft gust of wind and the cool grass under my feet.  

The bear pelt rug stretched from the wood fireplace to the sofas. The ceiling fan rotated above in a slow twirl. Blankets, throw pillows, and board games were piled on the ground close to the fire. It was just how I remembered it. 

Ava was asleep in the master bedroom. She laid with her back to me, in a curled-up ball underneath the comforters. I lifted the corner of the sheets and slid underneath the covers next to her. The bed felt toasty and the sheets were silky-smooth against my skin. With my arms wrapped around her, I gave her a gentle kiss.

“Honey, I’m here. I’m finally here,” I whispered into her ear.

She took a deep breath and turned toward me. Her smile gleamed back at me as she wiped the sleep from her eyes.

“Should I make us breakfast?” I asked. 

She nodded. Her mouth opened to speak, but what came out of it was a ragged shriek. 

“*Help! Someone, please help*!” Her shrill voice pushed me backward to the other side of the bed. It didn't match the cheerful smirk across her face.

“*John? Why are you doing this? Stop*!” The words bellowed out of her in sheer panic. 

I darted out of the room, and Ava followed. She approached slowly at first, calmly. The straps of her nightgown barely clung to the edge of her shoulders.

With a pleasant grin, she cried: *“You’re killing me, John! You’re killing me!”* 

I yanked the cabin door open and sprinted out into the open field, the neon-painted sky above. I glanced back at Ava standing at the doorway. She took three slow steps down the front porch. 

Her voice echoed through the quiet open field, desperate screams and howls that resembled a wounded animal.

I tried to steady my mind and brought forward the neural link connection to the dark web. There was a warm sensation like I was experiencing a fever, and something clicked in my consciousness. I wrote a message to the contact address at MetaLink through my mind. 

“*Fuck you, John!* *Somebody, help*!” 

I kept running, the periphery of the forest closer and closer.

URGENT: EXPUNGED MEMORIES 

Ava followed, chasing me at a now alarming pace. She looked like she could almost be giggling, like we were playing a game of tag. 

“*Let go of me, John! Let go!*”

My lungs heaved in and out. Time was hard to pinpoint in this plane of existence, but the stitch in my side and the aching in the soles of my feet indicated that we had to have been running for a long time. Possibly hours. 

The cabin was out of sight now, the lake long gone. There was only forest now—a suffocatingly dense gathering of trees that surrounded me from every angle. The evergreen trees, the light dusting of snow, it all felt misplaced. This was scenery that differed from the summer cabin. It was pulled from another grim location, one that was never supposed to exist *here*.

Ava had covered much of the distance now. The way she pumped her arms, she did not appear to be tired or out of breath. She was nearly at my heels before I finally received a response:

*AUTOMATED: We are currently experiencing technical difficulties. Please remain patient as our experts work to fix the glitch.*

I have received nothing more, and Anya’s screams still slice across the never-ending forest. By the dim glow of the neon sky, I pray that a response is received soon. These issues go against the terms of service; I was promised full control of the data and twenty-four-hour support. This whole experience has been a nightmare; it has felt more like punishment than freedom.

I keep running, glimpses of her smile poking through the rustling branches of the snowy forest. But I’m not sure how much longer my bloodied feet can [take](https://www.reddit.com/r/aproyal/comments/kpu2co/please_read_if_you_enjoyed_any_of_my_stories/)...
