The golden days for me were by far ages 9-10. Life was simple, I’d go to school and when I got home I was able to do pretty much whatever I wanted to. I was lucky enough to grow up during a time when you could tell where all your friends were by the bikes that would be piled in the front yard.

One of my friends was well known around the neighborhood and his house was the go-to hangout spot for all of us. We’d always gather there for makeshift gaming tournaments which almost always consisted of either 007 or Super Smash Bros.

That’s how I ended up meeting Paul. Paul was a couple years older than me, but we were both by far the better gamers in our little group. With us both being major gaming nerds, we quickly became best friends.

Eventually we both stopped hanging out with the others as they started to take interest in other things like playing “war” outside. Instead, I would go over to Paul’s house nearly every weekend, almost always staying the night and would spend nearly all of school breaks over at his house too.

Paul’s house was always a mess, and you had to watch where you stepped so you wouldn’t knock over piles of paperwork, scattered junk and endless cardboard boxes. His parents were definitely hoarders or something, but it never bothered me otherwise I wouldn’t have been there just about every day.

The days at Paul’s house were always the same consisting of us playing Super Smash Bros. and trying to best each other. It was like a ritual for us to gather in front of the TV screen gaming for hours and eating nothing but S’mores Pop-tarts and chugging Mountain Dew.

Paul’s mom was really nice and soft-spoken, so was his dad. His mom was usually the one to greet me and let me inside. I don’t know what either his parents did for work, but Paul’s parents were always home. His mom’s office room was right by the front door when you went inside and that’s where she would always be, glued to her computer.

I had always assumed that Paul’s dad was a blue-collar guy of some sort due to his normally dirty appearance. He was much older than other parents and if I had to guess, was probably in his late fifties or early sixties and had already gone gray and mostly bald. He never spoke much but other than that he was just a typical dad.

As time went on, I noticed that Paul’s dad would make his way to their basement, and I never once saw him come out after doing so. The bedroom belonging to Paul’s parents was right by the basement door, so I never thought much of it and figured his dad always went straight to bed without us ever taking notice.

Paul and I inevitably grew out of Smash Bros. and our ritual changed to playing Mario Kart 64 in the basement where a makeshift living room was set up with old, but big and comfy recliners. The basement stretched the entire floor plan of the house and almost every square inch was piled to the ceiling with boxes and old furniture. There was a narrow path amid all the junk that led around the entire space in a giant square.

The only light for the basement by the time the sun would go down belonged to a single bulb leading down the stairs and the glow of the TV screen. Around that time Paul would always chicken out and call it a day and I’d head home.

Staying over one night, I decided to stay behind and play a while longer after Paul had already chickened out. I stayed up for a couple more hours practicing the “Rainbow Road” course on Mario Kart (Paul always won on this course and it infuriated me.)

Growing bored of numerous races against the 150cc computers I decided to call it a night. Turning off the N64 and the TV, the only light left was the faint glow of the lightbulb on the basement stairs.

As soon as I turned to walk towards the stairs, I was met with a pair of eyes stuck to me from inside one of the massive piles of junk. My eyes slowly adjusted to the dark and I could make out a small portion of a face. Paul’s dad was staring at me at about chest-level like he was sitting down in the midst of the pile.

I stared back for a grueling minute waiting for him to pop out and say, “Ha! Gotcha’!” like a joke or something, but he never did.

I left Paul’s house without a word and went straight home. The next morning, I got into a lot of trouble with my mom. Paul's dad had called making sure that I got home safely.
