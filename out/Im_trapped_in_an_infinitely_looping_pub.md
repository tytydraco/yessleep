If this post goes through please for the love of god let me know. I am posting it everywhere I can but so many websites don’t work or look weird. I’m trying to remain calm but I’m starting to lose it. DO NOT ACCEPT AN INVITATION FROM “MARTIN SMITH” TO PLAY THE PUB ADVENTURE GAME. He’s on a lot of online forums and seems super chill but I promise you he is not. I don’t know what the hell he is. Okay. I’m new to my area and don’t know many people so I looked online to make some new friends, a pretty normal move. I like to drink so thought a pub quiz team or something like that would be cool. Then I found the pub adventure game. Worst decision of my life so far and I have made plenty of bad ones.



The pub is called Tail-Eater. Weird name I know but it wasn’t showing up on google maps or anything so I had to get Martin to share a pinned location. He was really friendly online and seemed to share a lot of common interests with me. Part of me worried he was looking for a date but I don’t swing that way anymore but luckily it is a five player game. Cards and dice games can be fun in the right pub environments. The Tail-Eater was a basement pub in a quiet part of town far from the centre. That should have been a red flag. I always get nervous before meeting new people and was sweating a bit and had the urge to shit - I don’t care about tmi here because I don’t know if anyone besides me will ever read this. I think I have IBS but I don’t know. Walking down those steps filled me with apprehension which I now realize might have been my soul warning me to gtfo. Inside it was quiet and had a haphazard interior design with ancient sofas and well-worn wooden tables and chairs strewn about at random. The walls were exposed brick and screamed hipster but I liked it. Not anymore. 



There is a man in a business suit on his laptop in one corner with a half finished pint next to him, he is sitting on a leather sofa. A couple are having a quiet conversation at the bar with colourful cocktails in front of them. The bartender is tall, wide and bald with viking-esc tattoos on the back of his head. He is friendly. The people I came to see were sitting on two sofas facing one another with a low wooden table between them. Martin, Amanda, Jon and Eleanor. Martin was just how I imagined him to be; exactly how I imagined him to be. His smile put me at ease immediately and his outfit was casual but stylish and damn he was handsome. Amanda was a short woman with blonde pigtails; she looked nervous. Jon is lean and wearing a quarter zip fleece that screams project management. Eleanor is a goth approaching thirty. I got to know them on the surface level over a few drinks before Martin clapped his hands together very dramatically and said we should start the game. 



From his pocket he produced a twenty-sided dice and handed it to Amanda first. She turned it about in her fingers and remarked that all the sides showed the same thing. A snake eating its own tail. Martin laughed and told her to roll it. She complied and to nobody's surprise it landed with a face showing the snake. Everyone else took a turn rolling the dice before me and when I picked it up for my turn a bit of bile leapt up my throat. I wasn’t that drunk but my body reacted that way. The game had started. I rolled the dice and got a similar result to the rest. Martin smiled contently and said that was it. The rest of us shared looks of surprise and disappointment. This shit was worse than snakes and ladders. What were the rules? How did we win? Martin said it would all make sense soon and ducked outside to make a ‘phone call’. He didn’t show up for an hour.



I continued chatting with the others pleasantly enough. They were not my typical crowd but we were all similar ages and could relate about certain things. Time ticked by and more drinks were drank but Martin still did not return. I tried messaging him online but there was no response. Eventually we chalked the whole thing up as a weird evening but not an altogether unpleasant one. Amanda had to leave first and departed with a wave. I stayed with Jon and Eleanor for a while longer but we decided to leave soon after, it was a Thursday night after all, is it still Thursday now? We all exited the pub at the same time. I could see the outside world and the stone steps leading back to street level. I felt the breeze on my face and I started to think about work tomorrow. Then I was walking back inside the pub with Jon and Eleanor beside me. Everything was as it had been. The other patrons had not left before us. The business man was sitting in his corner and the couple were sitting by the bar. I now know that the bartender had hair this time. We laughed awkwardly before turning around and walking out of the pub again. Again we reentered it. This time the business man’s shirt was pink. I don’t know how many times we entered the pub, pivoted about and exited in sequence. Five times? Ten times? Our awkward laughter turned nervous. By the time we stopped and acknowledged what was going on the pub had changed quite a lot. Jon was the one to recommend we go back to our seats to have a chat. My brain wasn’t accepting what had happened but hearing Jon speak out loud forced me to confront reality. We couldn’t leave. Eleanor’s hands shook violently by her side and I lost control of my breathing. I don’t panic quick but fucking hell this is a situation you can panic in. 



Now we are sitting in the pub in silence on our phones trying to contact anyone but something is wrong. We have no idea if Amanda somehow got out. I hope she is okay. I have no phone signal and the wifi is dodgy as hell. We’re trying to figure out what to do next but I’m worried something bad is going to happen. If this gets out anywhere please let me know. DO NOT ACCEPT AN INVITATION FROM “MARTIN SMITH” TO PLAY THE PUB ADVENTURE GAME. I fear we’ve walked right into a trap.
