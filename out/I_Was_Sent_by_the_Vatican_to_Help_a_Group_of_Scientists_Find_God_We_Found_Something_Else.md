Hey everyone.

My name is Matteo. I am a priest, but after last month, I can’t step inside a church without hearing that hum again.

\---

About three weeks ago, at the end of September, My Bishop handed me a letter. A red wax seal with the Vatican crest. Two keys crossed. Three sentences.

“***You will assist a cooperative research mission in Sweden. Your task: to help them find God. You leave tomorrow.***”

I thought it meant evangelism. I even joked with my Bishop that I should bring pamphlets. He offered me a grim look; his parting words were: “Pack warm.”

\---

The next day, I discovered that I wasn't alone; they had sent three of us.

Father Gabriel, a sixtyish ex-professor with a pocket full of theology quotes and nicotine gum.

Sister Lucia, late twenties, part linguist, part scholar, fully devoted to the Word. She wrote notes on everything.

And me, the token optimist.

We landed in Sweden when the sun clung to the horizon, and the first snow was fresh on the ground.

Three men in black coats met us, no introductions, no smiles. They took our passports and cell phones, and then we drove north for what must have been hours.

Somewhere out there, the snow began, and the mountains grew. About fifteen minutes before we stopped, I could just barely make out the words of a sign on the side of the road:

***“Welcome to Heaven, permanent population: 0.”***

Gabriel leaned over. “Population zero. Maybe they’re hiring.”

Lucia rolled her eyes. “You joke now. Watch us get reassigned to purgatory next.”

“This is north Sweden,” Gabriel said. “Feels like we already did."

The driver joked, almost to himself, “Purgatory would be warmer," then continued: "Heaven is the name of the mineshaft where the site we're going to is located. The sign is an old joke from the mining days. Mostly."

Carved into the side of one of the mountains was a black steel gate: engraved on the front in bold lettering:

***"Site Theta-7 / ACCESS RESTRICTED"***

A tall fence, topped with spotlights and barbed wire, caged off the perimeter of the mountain around the gate.

Lucia muttered, “Looks more like Hell than Heaven.”

Gabriel said, “Yeah. Or a prison.”

The hum started before the doors even opened; a pressure you felt in your bones, not your ears.

\---

We were given no time for rest, as it was already early in the morning when we arrived. Inside was all glass and metal. Everything vibrated as if a massive engine was idling somewhere in the heart of the facility.

That’s when we met Erik. Tall, rumpled, coffee thermos welded to his hand. He looked like he hadn’t slept since the late '90s. He spoke, gesturing grandly to the facility around him:

***“Welcome to the edge of Heaven,” he said. “Or what's left of it, most of it's buried in rubble.”***

Gabriel raised an eyebrow. “You’re the boss here?”

Erik grinned. “Engineer. But I'm your designated *handler*, so don't expect anyone other than me to even acknowledge you around here.”

He led us through corridors lined with lights that buzzed just off-tempo with the hum, then into a glass chapel suspended over a chasm filled with ice.

“Don’t let the décor fool you,” he said, gesturing to the rough metallic pews and screens displaying various graphs. “It’s got great acoustics!”

Lucia squinted at the floor. “What’s under there?”

“An old mineshaft, flooded over and frozen solid,” Erik said. Then, after a beat, “And plumbing. Try not to drop anything!”

\---

Later that night, we were finally informed we'd be able to rest, if rest was something we could manage in this place. Erik walked us down a narrow hall that vibrated like a struck bell.

“Quarters are this way,” he said. “They used to house lab staff before the most recent updates. Since then, staff refuse to stay down here for longer than a few nights."

“And why would that be?” Gabriel asked, almost grumpily.

“Lights flickering, doors opening by themselves, disembodied voices whispering Bible passages. Typical *haunting* behavior.” Erik said, making the "jazz hands" gesture and trying his best to make it sound like a joke. He failed.

He swiped his badge and pointed to three gray doors labeled with our names.

“Rooms are sanitized, but not sanctified. Try to sleep anyway.”

Lucia glanced back toward the chapel. “Does the hum ever stop?”

“If it stops,” Erik said, halfway down the hall, “wake me immediately. That’s the only thing worse than it getting louder.”

\---

The next day was the beginning of the "Calibration Cycle." Erik explained it as a three-day period where our *harmonics* would be tested, but didn't explain exactly what that meant. We assumed he meant vocal harmonics, and moved on.

We spent the entire morning reading scripture into microphones while various people in lab coats watched graphs and field readings flash across their monitors.

Every verse made the tone shift slightly.

Later that day, at dinner, Lucia asked: “You’re measuring belief?”

Erik shook his head. “Reaction. The Field reacts to conviction. Yours happens to be louder than most.”

Gabriel muttered, “So we’re loudspeakers for God?”

Erik grinned. “Yeah, or something that speaks the same language, maybe.”

Later, in the cafeteria, Erik sat with us, poking at mashed potatoes that looked lab-grown.

“Just how long have you worked in this field?” Gabriel asked.

Erik responded, "About twenty, but specifically at this site for ten. This site is pretty unique; most sites just monitor the Field. Theta-7 is... different. We try to interact with it. There were other Theta-designated sites with similar goals, but most of them don't exist anymore.”

Lucia tilted her head. “Interact?”

“Think of it like a conversation,” he said. “You speak, the Field answers. Sometimes in words, sometimes in pressure waves, sometimes in ways we can’t translate.”

I frowned. “And you’re saying faith changes it?”

Erik’s grin grew almost sinister. “Faith changes everything it touches. We just happen to have the instruments to measure it.”

Gabriel grimaced and started sarcastically, "Penumbra Foundation, huh? Sounds like the best name ever for a shadow organization."

Erik's smile widened. "You're not *entirely* wrong. Penumbra was our precursor organization, though. There used to be three branches, and at least two had to agree on a plan before any decision was made. Too much red tape and bureaucracy. We split up back in the early 2000s."

"And what do you call yourselves now?" scoffed Gabriel.

Erik's smile vanished at this, and his posture went stiff. "We don't. That is, we don't call ourselves anything as a collective... not since what happened in Ireland."

He did not elaborate any further.

\---

On the second day of our calibration cycle, during our scripture reading, the lights flickered in perfect rhythm: three pulses, pause, three again.

Gabriel joked, “If God’s knocking, I wish He’d call first.”

Erik said cryptically, “That wouldn't be God knocking. That would be the door remembering how to be opened, if anything.”

At dinner, Lucia asked him why we were chosen.

“Faith, or rather, *conviction,* is a signal booster,” he said. “It clears the noise. The Field hears you cleaner than it hears us. There are... *other* aspects that set you apart, which we confirmed with yesterday's calibration exercises.”

"And why does that matter? What in the Field 'hears' us, or even cares what we say?"

Erik started, "Because whatever hears you can have a very real effect on our reality, and can *manifest* if the right conditions are met." He hesitated, then chose his next words carefully, “We classify what comes through based on its composition. Incorporeal Entities, shorthanded as IE, are pure resonance, energy without definite form. Corporeal Entities, shorthanded as CE, are when an Incorporeal Entity decides to put on a body. There are two distinct types, based on the method of manifestation. Type A forms itself from energy; bright, short-lived. Type B *borrows* a host. Those are usually weaker, but models show they are biologically immortal. With a constant food source, that is, if they're starved, they'll eventually revert to an Incorporeal Form."

Gabriel grimaced. “You’re describing possession.”

Erik gave a genuine chuckle. “It's an older term, sir, but it checks out.”

Lucia, who seemed irate at the entire conversation up to this point, said coldly, "And how do we know you aren't just making this all up? We haven't seen any documentation to support... well, *anything* you've said so far."

Erik's grin from before returned, "That's the neat part, you don't."

\---

On what we were told was the third and final day of our calibration, we performed our usual morning routine of prayers and passage readings and had lunch and dinner as usual. Before we could retire to our rooms for the night, however, Erik called us all to a meeting in the Chapel.

"Tonight is the night, everyone!" He started, more cheerful than usual, "Take your places, and wait for my signal over the intercom to begin reading. We only get one chance at this."

We weren't sure exactly what we were only getting one chance at, and we weren't exactly excited to find out.

At midnight, almost to the second, Erik’s voice came over the intercom: “Field stability confirmed. Begin sequence.”

Lucia started with the Psalms, Gabriel followed with the Creed, and I read from 1 John: *“That which was from the beginning, which we have heard...”*

The hum deepened. The glass trembled.

Then something started whispering under our words, faint at first, then unmistakable:

***“And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon.”***  
***“How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning.”***

Lucia faltered. “Erik... someone’s...”

“Keep cadence!” Erik barked.

The ice pulsed light in perfect rings.

Erik’s voice crackled over the intercom: “Amplitude spike. Crossing threshold.”

Then the Field spoke again, weaving through our voices:

***“I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.”***  
***“The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.”***

Gabriel whispered, “It’s quoting Scripture.”

Erik, over the intercom, static growing: “It isn't ... scripture, it's ...-membering it's ...”

The intercom cut out entirely at the last word.

\---

Only a moment after Erik's voice cut out completely, deep beneath our feet, we could see and hear layers of ice splitting apart.

Light rose through the ice and through the floor of the cathedral, like molten glass, forming something that hurt the space behind my eyes to look at; six wings unfolding, feathers made of glass, fire, and shadow. Too many eyes.

“CE-Type A manifestation!” Erik shouted, now bursting through the door to the chapel, “Lock the lattice!”

Several personnel stationed at consoles around the room simultaneously flipped levers and began tapping furiously on their monitor screens. Blue arcs snapped into place, caging the light.

I could feel a searing heat in my hand as the beads of the rosary I was clutching began melting into my palm. Lucia dropped to her knees and began praying loudly in Latin. Immediately, the figure turned toward her, and the hum became words that passed straight through bone:

***“See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren…”***

Lucia wept. “It’s beautiful.”

Then the figure turned towards Erik, and its tone changed; not to anger, but to grief.

***“The light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.”***

The creature folded its wings in upon itself and leaned close to the glass, voice rumbling like thunder across an open field:

***“The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars.”***

The hum peaked, and the light imploded.

Then nothing.

\---

I woke in a medical tent. My right palm was bandaged, the rosary beads had fused into the flesh, but there was no pain. Erik sat beside me, sling on his arm, eyes hollow.

“They said it lasted six seconds,” he murmured. "We weren't ready for a full Type A manifestation... but with the data gained from yesterday, we will be next time.

“Was it an angel?” I asked.

He stared at the tent wall. “Yeah, or something that remembers being one.”

A voice I recognized, and its typical sarcasm, came from the cot to my left:

"I guess we didn't help you *find God.* Mission failed, we'll get *Him* next time."

Erik looked at Gabriel like he'd just kicked over a gravestone.

"We lost three technicians yesterday. Those stationed around the chapel, controlling the containment field. Nothing was left of them to recover but biological films on the ground where they were standing. And... no trace of Lucia was discovered after the incident at all."

"No trace at all?" I said grimly.

"Not even enough to get a DNA sample. We believe she was, for lack of a better term, *consumed* by the Kyrie Field; transformed directly into resonance energy at the moment of the bright flash."

"Kyrie Field?" Gabriel's mocking tone rose from his cot, "Your lot really are on the nose with your naming conventions, aren't you?"

For a moment, Erik's smile returned. "It's a carryover from the Penumbra days. It gained favor with all three branches, so nobody felt the need to change it after the schism."

He turned to walk away, but looked back, as if remembering something, “Don’t pray for a while,” he said. “It probably still knows your voice, and we don't want it wandering too far from *Heaven*.”

"I'll see you again soon," he finished.

That was the last time I saw him. One of the men who brought us to the gate handed me a packet with a red wax seal. A circle with a triangle in the middle of it. I was instructed to give it to my Bishop when I got home.

\---

I'm back home. It's been a little over three weeks since what happened in Sweden. Church bells still make my ribs ache and my head swim. Some nights, the hum returns in the same pattern as before. Three pulses, pause, three again. When it happens, the lights flicker in sync, and I smell burnt copper and coffee, and under it, I hear his final words to me repeated:

“***I’ll see you again soon.”***

I have a feeling he didn't mean I'd see him again *before* I left Sweden. If you don't hear from me again, I may have joined Lucia...

***In the Field.***
