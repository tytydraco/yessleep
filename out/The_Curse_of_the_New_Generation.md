I’ve heard it said before that every house has its own traditions and that every family is its own culture. My Aunt Tina’s house and family perfectly illustrated that truism by their drink of choice—Pepsi.

When my mom needed someone to watch me after school, she usually dropped me off at my Aunt Tina’s house. And at her house, they drank Pepsi like it was water. They always had a fridge packed full of tall, frosted bottles that seemed to glisten with condensation, their coolness radiating from across the room. Everyone always seemed to have one in their hands or sitting on a nearby countertop. On hot days, I half-expected them to water the lawn with it.

The fridge seemed to have a magical quality, opening whenever a family member strolled by. Bottles of Pepsi would practically leap into their hands, carried on a misty cloud of chilled air. They leapt into everyone’s hands but mine, that is.

But—and here’s the rub—Tina wouldn’t let me have a Pepsi.

It made sense to me that since everyone else in the house had as much Pepsi as they wanted, I should get at least one bottle. But Tina had an ironclad rule: you could only have a Pepsi if you didn’t ask for a Pepsi.

It was very zen. A baffling conundrum. It was also a rule that only applied to me.

I tried everything. Mentioning I was thirsty just got me a warm, cloudy glass of water that smelled vaguely of old pipes. Saying I wanted something sweet disqualified me entirely.

So I got creative.

I’d stare fixedly at the fridge, where the Pepsi waited, its icy promise shimmering behind the glass. When Tina came into the kitchen, I’d try to catch her eye and jerk my gaze toward the fridge. When that didn’t work, I added dramatic gestures, twitching my head and shoulders as if my body were being magnetically pulled toward the fridge.

Still nothing.

I resorted to art. I drew Pepsi bottles with loving detail—the curves, the bold logo, the sparkling fizz. Once, I even drew Tina offering me a Pepsi and showed it to her. She squinted at it, frowned, and asked why I hadn’t drawn any breasts on the woman in the picture.

That was a dead end.

I tried other tricks. I’d straighten the fridge magnets, sending silent telepathic waves of longing. I clasped my hands and prayed, mouthing the word “Pepsi” as often and as clearly as possible. Tina, frustratingly, never seemed to notice—or worse, she noticed but didn’t care.

By this point, Tina’s blank stares and twitching mouth suggested she might be holding back laughter. Meanwhile, I was practically vibrating with desperation.

One day, having exhausted all other options, I decided to try something more drastic.

I whispered my plea, directing it to… well, the other guy. “Whoever’s out there on the… other side, if you’re listening, no matter what it takes, I just want Pepsi. Please.”

For a moment, nothing happened. The kitchen was still, the hum of the fridge the only sound. I sighed, figuring I’d reached a new low: begging the devil for soda. Then, with a sharp click, the humming stopped. For a moment, there was total and complete silence.

Then, with a sucking sound, the fridge door opened.

I froze, staring as a single frosted bottle of Pepsi slid forward from the perfectly packed rows, glinting in the dim kitchen light. Slowly, Tina walked in, as if in a trance, pulled the bottle free, and placed it in front of me without a word.

“Uh… thanks?” I said, my voice trembling.

Tina said nothing. Her eyes didn’t quite meet mine as she shuffled back out of the room.

I drank the Pepsi greedily. I was cold, sweet, and delicious. Then Tina came back and handed me another bottle! Then another. By the time my mom arrived, I was working on my third and starting to feel a little nauseous.

When my mom pulled into the driveway, she opened the trunk with a flourish.

“Guess what? I got us a great deal on Pepsi!”

The trunk was packed to the brim with bottles of Pepsi, gleaming blackly. Their bodies seemed strangely wasp-like in the dusk.

After that, it seemed like Pepsi was everywhere.

The school installed a free vending machine in the cafeteria. The machine hummed softly, a single, hypnotic note. Its glowing buttons blinked faintly, like a row of heavy-lidded, flickering eyes. My classmates, one by one, abandoned their usual drinks for Pepsi. By midmorning, they were jittery, their laughter sharp and frantic. By afternoon, their movements grew sluggish, their faces pale and slack.

At home, my mom switched to drinking nothing but Pepsi. Bottles crowded the fridge. Cases filled the closet floors. Empty cans spilled out of the trash and clattered to the floor in every room. The cloying, sugary scent of spilled Pepsi seeped into the carpet and the furniture, filling the air with a sticky sweetness that made me nauseous.

They disconnected the water fountains at school because of lack of use. At first, people laughed about it. By the second week, no one even commented. It was as if water had never existed at all.

The dreams started soon after.

I was standing in Tina’s kitchen, staring at the fridge. The door creaked open, releasing a sickly yellow glow. Black, bubbling liquid spilled out, flooding the floor. It crawled toward me, its tendrils fizzing and snaking toward my feet, moving in fits and starts, like some stop-motion nightmare. It fizzed against the linoleum, the sound sharp and insistent. I woke up screaming, drenched in something sticky. My mom thought I’d wet the bed, but I recognized the stains, the smell—it was Pepsi. Somehow, it had crossed over, spilling into the real world.

Avoiding Pepsi became impossible. The logo was everywhere—seemingly plastered on every billboard, every bus, every screen. It wasn’t just a logo; it was a presence. A heavy-lidded eye, pulsing with malevolence, and seeming to follow me everywhere I went.

It tormented me for years.

Socially, I became a pariah. Friends drifted away, confused by my disgust and my inability to participate in what had become the lifeblood of their routines. “Join the Pepsi people,” they’d say, smiling faintly, their decaying teeth exposed, their eyes glassy. When I refused, their smiles would falter, as if I’d betrayed some unspoken pact.

At work, my boss fired me when I refused to stock Pepsi in the breakroom fridge.

“You’re just… not a team player,” he said. “Come on, you’ve got a lot to live, and Pepsi’s got a lot to give!”

I retreated further into myself, becoming a recluse. But even in solitude, I couldn’t escape. The woodgrain of my desk seemed to ripple into the faint outline of the Pepsi logo. Books I tried to read blurred into nonsense, the words rearranging themselves into slogans: Live for now. The joy of Pepsi-Cola.

Meanwhile, the world outside crumbled.

Landfills overflowed with empty bottles and cans, their plastic and aluminum corpses choking the landscape. The oceans became graveyards of microplastics. “Every generation refreshes the world,” the ads still claimed, oblivious to the ruin they had caused.

Obesity rates soared. Children waddled into school clutching Pepsi-filled thermoses, their faces red and round. Dentists reported tooth decay at epidemic levels, the enamel of countless children’s teeth eroded by acid. “Be young, have fun, drink Pepsi,” the commercials chirped, as if mocking us.

And then there were the health complications. Studies linked aluminum from the cans to neurological disorders. My mom, perpetually clutching her frosted glass bottle, began complaining of constant headaches and numbness in her hands. When I begged her to stop drinking it, she just smiled faintly and said, “Why would I stop? It’s the choice of a new generation.”

Eventually, unable to bear watching my family and friends poison themselves, I drifted west, hoping to escape. I took back roads to avoid the billboards, averting my eyes to avoid the Pepsi displays at gas stations. I hoped the ocean, vast and eternal, might wash away the madness. Instead, it became the final straw.

The ocean looked wrong—black, glossy, and churning unnaturally. As I watched, a wave rolled in, hissing and fizzing at the edges. It crashed at my feet, leaving empty plastic bottles and streaks of brown stains behind.

Further out in the water, enormous bubbles rose and popped, releasing sprays of carbonation, plastic bottles, and sticky black liquid. The black water crept closer, eroding the sand and shore.

Unable to bear it, I turned away. Suddenly the ocean surged up. Before I could move, I was underwater. The ocean roared in my ears, and in the roar, I could hear a voice. It was deep, sickly sweet, and oozing satisfaction.

“Your generation chose this. The new generation is mine,” it said, stretching out the last letter into an endless hiss of escaping carbonation.

The last thing I felt was my throat and nose burning as the black tide pulled me under.

I woke up on the shore, surrounded by empty plastic bottles and tangled six-pack rings. A sticky film clung to my skin and hair. My lungs and eyes still burned, my body felt heavy, and the faint hiss of carbonation still rang in my ears.

There’s a horrible taste in my mouth. Sour. The sickly sweet chemical taste of the black water. Even now, as I tell you this, I can still feel it inside me—burning, bubbling, and threatening to come up. And I know the ocean of dark carbonated water, filled with chemicals and plastic, is out there too. Rising up to drown us all.
