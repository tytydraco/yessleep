The fridge at my Aunt Tina’s house was alive, opening whenever a family member strolled by. Bottles of soda would practically leap into their hands, carried on a misty cloud of chilled air, and glistening like forbidden treasures. But not for me.

When my mom needed someone to watch me after school, she usually dropped me off at Aunt Tina’s house. And at her house, soda wasn’t just a drink—it was a lifestyle.

Their fridge was always packed with tall, frosted bottles, their coolness radiating across the kitchen. On hot days, I half-expected them to water the lawn with it. Everyone had a bottle in hand or perched on a nearby countertop, the condensation leaving sticky rings on every surface.

The fridge door opened like clockwork whenever a family member walked by. Soda bottles practically leapt in their hands. Everyone’s hands but mine, that is.

But—and here’s the part that still baffles me—Tina wouldn’t let me have a soda.

It didn’t make sense. Everyone else could drink as much as they wanted, but Tina had a strict rule: you could only have soda if you didn’t ask for soda.

It was maddening. A zen riddle designed specifically to torment me.

I tried to follow the rule, but no matter what I did, I always seemed to fail. Mentioning I was thirsty got me a warm glass of water that smelled vaguely of rusted pipes. Saying I wanted something sweet disqualified me entirely.

I got desperate.

I stared longingly at the fridge, trying to will it open with my mind. When Tina walked in, I’d shoot meaningful glances at the fridge, adding dramatic sighs for effect. Nothing.

I tried art. I drew soda bottles in excruciating detail—the curves, the bold logos, the sparkling fizz. Once, I even sketched Tina handing me a bottle and showed it to her. She squinted at it, frowned, and asked why I hadn’t drawn any breasts on the woman.

That was a dead end.

I resorted to silent telepathy. I’d straighten the fridge magnets, clasp my hands in prayer, and mouth the word soda like a prayer. Tina didn’t seem to notice—or worse, she noticed but didn’t care.

By this point, her blank stares and twitching mouth suggested she was holding back laughter. Meanwhile, I was practically vibrating with frustration.

Finally, in a moment of desperation, I decided to try something drastic.

One afternoon, when Tina wasn’t looking, I knelt in the middle of the kitchen and whispered my plea to the unknown: “Whoever’s out there… on the other side… if you’re listening, no matter what it takes, I just want soda. Please.”

The kitchen held its breath.

The fridge hummed faintly, the sound worming its way under my skin. Then it stopped. Silence fell, heavy and absolute.

Just as I turned away, the hum returned, louder—a low, guttural growl. The fridge door creaked open, releasing a wet, sucking sound like lips smacking together. A single frosted bottle slid forward, shimmering in the dim light.

Slowly, Tina entered the room. She moved stiffly, her eyes glassy, and pulled the bottle free. Without a word, she placed it in front of me and shuffled out of the kitchen.

I stared at the bottle, my hands trembling. “Uh… thanks?”

Tina didn’t reply.

I drank greedily. The soda was cold, sweet, and overwhelming. Then Tina returned and handed me another bottle. And another. By the time my mom arrived, I was working on my third and starting to feel sick.

“Guess what?” my mom said as I climbed into the car. “I got us a great deal on soda!”

The trunk was full of bottles, their black-and-red labels gleaming in the dusk. They looked strangely alive, their curves insect-like.

After that, soda was everywhere.

The school installed free vending machines in the cafeteria. They hummed with a hypnotic tone, their glowing buttons blinking like half-lidded eyes. My classmates abandoned their usual drinks, one by one. By midmorning, they were jittery, their laughter sharp and frantic. By afternoon, they moved sluggishly, their faces pale and slack.

At home, my mom drank nothing but soda. Bottles crowded the fridge and filled the closets. Empty cans spilled out of the trash, rolling across the floors. The sugary scent seeped into the carpet and furniture, clinging to everything.

They disconnected the water fountains at school, claiming lack of use. No one even complained. It was as if water had never existed.

The dreams started soon after.

In my dreams, I stood in Tina’s kitchen. The fridge door creaked open, spilling black, bubbling liquid across the floor. It crawled toward me, tendrils snaking over the linoleum. It smelled of sweetness and rot, fizzing softly as it crept closer. I woke up screaming, drenched in something sticky. My mom thought I’d wet the bed, but I recognized the smell. It was soda. Somehow, it had crossed over.

The reoccurring dream continued to haunt me.

In the waking world, avoiding soda became impossible as well. Its brand names and logos seem to appear on every billboard, every bus, every screen. A malevolent presence, following me everywhere.

“Join the soda society,” my friends said, smiling faintly, their teeth decaying and their eyes dull.

Even at work, soda was unavoidable. When I refused to stock the breakroom fridge, my boss fired me.

“You’re not a team player,” he said. “Soda’s got a lot to give, and you’ve got a lot to lose.”

Around me, it seemed as though soda was everywhere, poisoning everything.

Landfills overflowed with plastic bottles. The oceans became graveyards of bobbing plastic bottles, straws, and microplastics. “Every generation refreshes the world,” the ads claimed, oblivious to the ruin.

Children waddled into school, gripping 32 ounce plastic bottles in their hands. Dentists reported epidemic levels of tooth decay. And still, the commercials chirped, “Be bold, stay young, and drown in soda!”

And then there were the health complications. Studies speculated about the effects of consuming massive quantities of caffeinated beverages, linking them to headaches, fatigue, and neurological strain. My mom, perpetually clutching her frosted glass bottle, began complaining of constant headaches and numbness in her hands. When I begged her to stop drinking it, she just smiled faintly and said, “Why would I stop? It’s the taste of this generation.”

Diabetes rates surged silently, like a shadow spreading over the population. The signs were everywhere: sluggish movements, shaking hands, and the dull haze in people’s eyes as they reached for yet another bottle of soda.

Eventually, unable to bear watching my family and friends poison themselves, I drifted west, hoping to escape. I took back roads to avoid the billboards, averting my eyes to avoid the soda displays at every gas stations. I hoped the ocean, vast and eternal, might wash away the madness. Instead, it became the final straw.

The ocean looked wrong—black, glossy, and churning unnaturally. As I watched, a wave rolled in, hissing and fizzing at the edges. It crashed at my feet, leaving empty plastic bottles and brown stains behind.

Further out in the water, enormous bubbles rose and popped, releasing sprays of carbonation, plastic bottles, and sticky black liquid. The black water crept closer, eroding the sand and shore.

Unable to bear it, I turned away. Suddenly, the ocean surged up. Before I could move, I was underwater. The ocean roared in my ears, and in the roar, I could hear a voice. It was deep, sickly sweet, and oozing satisfaction.

“Your generation chose this. The next generation belongs to me,” it said, stretching out the last word into an endless high pitched hiss of escaping carbonation.

The last thing I felt was my throat and nose burning as the black tide pulled me under.

I woke up on the shore, surrounded by empty plastic bottles and tangled six-pack rings. A sticky film clung to my skin and hair. My lungs and eyes still burned, my body felt heavy, and the faint hiss of carbonation still rang in my ears.

There’s a horrible taste in my mouth. Sour. That sickly sweet chemical taste of the black water. Even now, as I tell you this, I can still feel it inside me—burning, bubbling, and threatening to come up. And I know the ocean of dark rising water, filled with chemicals and plastic, is out there too. Rising up to drown us all.
