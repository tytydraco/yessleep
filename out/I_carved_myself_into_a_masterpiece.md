I used to be a happy kid. Life was simple, even bright. I was good at school, good at sports, people liked me. It wasn’t anything extraordinary, but it was enough to feel like I belonged somewhere.

Then puberty hit, and everything changed. Around fifteen, I started developing cystic acne—deep, painful, and relentless. At first, it was just a few spots, but within months they grew, merged, and multiplied until nearly forty percent of my face was covered. People reacted like I was diseased. Friends stopped talking to me. Strangers stared or looked away. Rumors spread that if you touched me, you’d catch whatever was “wrong” with me. Even when I tried to speak, nobody would meet my eyes; they stared at the craters instead. It crushed me. By the end of high school, I barely left my room. In college I became invisible, my head always bowed, my voice always quiet.

That’s when I finally found the only thing that mattered to me: food. Cooking gave me control. It gave me a way to create beauty with my hands, even if my face was a ruin. I spent thousands of hours perfecting every cut, every cooking method, every plating technique. It didn’t matter if everything else about me fell apart. I would at least be the best at one thing. That’s how I became a chef.

Now I work in a kitchen where the heat, sweat, and grease make my skin flare even worse sometimes. But I don’t care. It’s the one place where I feel proud of myself. The plates I send out are tiny little masterpieces; they’re the only parts of me people will ever admire.

That’s where I met Edina. She wasn’t like the others. She stood next to me on the line, asking questions, watching how I sliced, plated, seasoned. She listened when I spoke, really listened. She met my eyes when she talked to me. She asked about my life, about my memories, about what brought me to cooking. She shared her own stories. She laughed at my jokes, even the bad ones, and smiled when I explained something carefully, like a technique or flavor. I felt something I hadn’t felt in years: trust, understanding, and warmth. She genuinely cared about me, not just my food. I started staying after shifts to talk to her. I looked forward to those moments more than anything else.

But then came the little things.
“You’re so quiet,” she’d say with a laugh. “You’d be so handsome if you took better care of your skin.”
Or: “You’re so talented; it’s such a shame no one sees you.”
Or: “I feel bad for you sometimes. You’re like one of those tragic geniuses in movies.”
She said them lightly, like they weren’t daggers. Maybe she didn’t even realize they were daggers. But they stuck. They twisted. Every time she said something like that, I felt smaller, uglier, more monstrous.

Five or six months passed. Slowly, I started to feel confident again. I felt like maybe I could belong in the world, like maybe I wasn’t a monster. And then one evening, outside after a shift, I finally asked her to go on a date with me. My heart was pounding, my palms slick with sweat. I told her, seriously this time, that I wanted to be with her.

She froze. Her face shifted, her eyes tightening. I Then she said no. She said she could be my friend, but that’s all. She told me people would judge her if she dated me. She said she couldn’t feel attraction for me, not with the way I looked. She half-joked that maybe I could get a complete plastic surgery and she might reconsider, but mostly she just said no. I felt all my trust and hope crash around me.

I thought she was different. But she was just like everyone else.

Faced with that rejection, one of my happiest memories of the past few months surfaced: the way she had praised my knife skills in the kitchen, how precise and careful I was with every slice. That’s when the idea formed—how I could finally put those knife skills to use for me, not for the people I made food for.

It happened on a Tuesday night after close. I stayed behind, locked the kitchen door. The fluorescent lights flickered like an old hospital. My hands shook as I took off my apron and unrolled my knives. Their steel gleamed like teeth.

I don’t know how long it took.
I don’t remember the pain after the first cut.
I only remember the wet, squelching sound, the smell of iron and sweat and something like burnt hair. I carved, sliced, peeled. Layer after layer, like trimming fat from a roast. My face burned, skin sticking to the knife with a sticky, warm snap. Blood ran down my chin, dripped onto the floor in dark pools. I could feel the raw edges of my cheeks pulling, curling, separating. I smelled the coppery, metallic stench, felt the heat of the raw flesh against my fingers. Slice after slice, my own skin giving way.

When I woke up on the kitchen floor hours later, the tiles were slick with blood. My hands were trembling, my vision hazy. But when I dragged myself up and found a mirror, I gasped.

I was perfect.
No more cystic acne.
No more scars.
My face was raw, red, and glistening—but smooth, symmetrical, alive. It was art. I was art.

There was only one person I wanted to see.

I drove to Edina’s house, still grinning ear to ear, still dripping. I could barely hold the steering wheel from how badly my hands shook. But all I could think about was her expression when she saw me—the real me, the beautiful me.

I knocked on her door.

When she opened it, there was a heartbeat of silence. Then she shrieked—louder than I’ve ever heard anyone scream—her voice tearing through the night like an alarm. She stumbled back into the hallway, eyes wide, her face twisted in something between horror and nausea.

“What did you do to yourself?” she whispered, voice breaking.

“I fixed it,” I said, smiling so wide my lips trembled. “I fixed everything. I made myself perfect—for you.”

“Stay away from me,” she hissed, her voice shaking, eyes glued to my face. “Stay the hell away from me.”

Then she slammed the door.

I stood there on her porch, hands trembling, the cold night air biting through my clothes. In the glass of her window, my reflection stared back. My new skin was already curling at the edges, peeling and sagging like overcooked meat, blood still dripping from the seams. My cheeks twitched slightly with every pulse, raw flesh trembling, a sticky, dark sheen of coagulated blood catching the light.

But all I could see was beauty. My masterpiece. My perfect work.
I smiled at the reflection, at the stranger who looked back at me.
I was right all along.
I am the best.
I am beautiful.
I am my own masterpiece.
