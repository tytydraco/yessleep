At first, I thought it was a scarecrow. A lone figure in the distance, standing in the middle of the tobacco fields. It was all white, vaguely human-shaped, and swaying languidly back and forth as if caught in a gentle breeze. That was strange in and of itself, given that it was a breezeless, stiflingly humid afternoon in the swampy lowlands of North Carolina that I called home. 

It struck me as strange, but not concerning. The more I looked at it, the more “un-scarecrow-like” it looked. It didn’t look like it had legs, or clothes, and from this distance, there was no way I could tell if it had a face. My second thought was that it was one of those floaters that appear in your eyes sometimes. 

I rubbed my eyes, expecting it to disappear, but the thing was still there, twisting its thin white torso and waving its long, billowing arms in some kind of dance. It was clearly humanoid, but there was something distinctly serpentine about its movements, which were random yet slow and deliberate. 

I’m not sure why, but I felt the urge to walk towards the thing. I suppose I wanted to figure out what it was. The field it stood in belonged to the neighbors. I use that term lightly, given that their actual house was several miles away. They’d never put up anything in the field before. 

The loose dirt of the field coated my sneakers as I walked towards the white figure, trying not to trample the tobacco plants. I knew the field was bigger than it looked, but I didn’t seem to be getting any closer to the thing. Perhaps it was just the muggy heat, but I felt as if something was physically pushing me back. I began to wonder if the thing’s motions were merely the result of a heat mirage, until it lowered its arms. It stopped waving itself around and instead began to pulsate. With its arms by its side, its whole body repeatedly constricted and relaxed. It reminded me of a beating heart, although the rhythm was slightly off.

With each pulse of its tube-shaped body, a wave of intense nausea washed over me. I felt as though I was walking in place, unable to stop the movement of my legs, but incapable of getting any closer to my destination. I was walking for eternity in the span of a few moments. My head pounded, the throbs increasing in frequency as the white thing undulated faster. 

In an instant, I sat up in bed, sunlight filtering through dingy floral curtains. It was morning again. I could hear the familiar sound of songbirds outside my window and the serene hum of the old AC unit. It must have been a dream. 

I flopped my head back down on the pillow in a mix of relief and uncertainty. My head still hurt a little. It was then that I noticed something on my ceiling. A ring shaped mark, just above the headboard. It looked like rain damage. I wasn’t sure if it had been there before, but for some reason, it stuck out to me. 

That experience happened just a few months ago. Since then, things have been strange. Nothing nearly as crazy as my “encounter” as happened, but I’ve just felt… off. Somewhat disconnected from everything, as if viewing reality from an outsider’s perspective. My family has pointed out the fact that I often stare off into space lately. 

I’ve noticed a couple of more outwardly unsettling things, too. There’s something wrong with the dirt. 

A few weeks after the initial incident, in an attempt to distract myself, I decided to go fishing with my cousin. I hadn’t told him, or anyone, about what happened. At that point, I was still convinced it must have been a dream. We were trying to dig up some nightcrawlers to use as bait– we usually had a lot of those crawling around in the soil on our property, and we’d never had any trouble finding enough of them for a few hours of fishing. Until that day. 

We found worms, alright. But not nightcrawlers. No nightcrawlers at all. Instead, each chunk of dirt we dug up was teeming with these skinny, white, long worms I’d never seen before. They were absolutely everywhere. I probably saw thousands of them, multiplying every time our shovels severed their threadlike bodies in two. We ended up trying to bait a hook with one, but it was far too skinny to work. My cousin didn’t seem particularly freaked out by the unfamiliar species of worm, and he told me I was being weird for being hesitant to touch them. 

  
Not only that, but the dirt smells fucking awful too. It's difficult to describe. Something between mildew, sewage, and raw beef. It's got a weird, doughy texture. At the time I had no clue as to what it could be, but now I think it might've been mucus from those skinny worms. 

That’s far from the only bizarre occurrence that’s happened to me recently, but if I’m honest, I’m scared of sounding crazy. These things probably aren’t connected at all, and I’m just paranoid after having a particularly weird nightmare. That’s what I’ve been telling myself, anyway. 

Every time I stare out at the tobacco fields, though, I get this weird sensation. The back of my neck feels strange, and I get slightly nauseated. And if I look at just the right spot, I see these “cracks” in my vision, with bright light and color pouring through. My best guess is that they’re migraine auras, but I can’t help but wondering if they really are cracks– cracks in our world, or reality, or something. Jeez, I sound schizophrenic even to myself. I can’t decide what’s worse– I’m a total nutjob, or these “experiences” are real and connected. For now, you can decide what you think is going on.

I’ll try to keep everyone updated if anything like this happens again. If nothing else, I hope this is entertaining to someone out there.
