I’ll start by telling you what has been going on since my last post. It’s been a lot. So, I’m going to struggle. The blanket of fog in front of my eyes and enveloping my mind is getting thicker. I like to believe that it’s a good thing. I don’t want to think coherently anymore. Thinking means remembering and remembering is pain like I’ve never felt before. Like my body is being ripped limb from limb  just like my paper doll.

Several days ago, the note my psycho neighbor left me was scrunched in my fist while her paper replica of my mother sat on my kitchen table. She had kidnapped my mom after revealing her so-called children were nothing but brainwashed flesh puppets under her control.

If something were to happen to your mom, do not worry. I will take you in. I want you to remember that.

Love,

[Mrs Wilder.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10a975k/ive_been_talking_to_the_boy_next_door_through_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

PS: I can’t wait for you to (not) meet my newest son! 

I was still seeing what had happened the night before. I was seeing her plunging the blade of the knife into a squirming body bag until it went still, and then throwing it over her shoulder like they were nothing. Just doll pieces. Spare parts. That’s what she had said, kneeling next to the body bag where scarlet had started to pool, staining the sidewalk. I had watched her reach out with an almost motherly-like touch, grazing her fingers over the body. Her fifth victim. Mrs Wilder already had Casper and his siblings. Her four ‘original’ children. So, what did she need with another kid? Scrunching the letter into a ball, I held myself. Kidnapping my mother because of my so-called disobedience was a new low. 

The witch knew exactly how to scare me. How to control me. But I wasn’t giving up. After dumping the cookies in the trash, I grabbed my mom’s paper-doll and tried to rip it to pieces, but the paper felt strange between my fingers—like I wasn’t tearing through paper. It was thicker and harder to get through, like tearing through plastic. The doll had a waxy texture to it. But I was determined to get rid of the thing. Gritting my teeth, I used all my strength to tear off the stupid doll’s head. That was enough.

It was such a pathetic way of thinking but I was sure that destroying Mrs Wilder’s paper rendition of my mother would save the real version. Throwing what was left of the doll in the trash with the cookies, I sprinted upstairs to my bedroom after locking the door and grabbing a knife from the kitchen.

Initially, I wanted nothing more than to crawl under my bed and hide. I couldn’t stop shivering, my body trembling. The events of the night before were still haunting me.

 Mrs Wilder’s kids were nothing but patchwork dolls made from dead flesh and Casper was a work in progress. Unfinished. From the look of the framed ultrasounds in the Wilder hallway, I was right. My neighbor had lost her own children at birth, and had kidnapped four of them in their place, and was raising them as her own using some kind of enhanced brainwashing technology.  The town knew exactly what she was doing, and the bitch had the cops right under her thumb. They had delivered her a dead body for spare parts. I had to get out. With or without my mom, I was getting out of town. But I knew I couldn’t leave them. 

Mrs Wilder’s children. Her dolls. Whatever was left of them, even if I couldn’t call them human… I had to get them out of there.  

After the night before, I was sure Casper’s window would be blocked out by his curtains. But I was wrong. I could see his room perfectly. Though there was no sign of him. His bed was unmade, pillows and sheets crumpled on the floor. I wondered where he was. Maybe he was in the kitchen having breakfast with his plastic brothers and sister. Breathing hard, I struggled to think straight. I had to think of a coherent plan. Mrs Wilder’s letter was a threat--and looking around my own room, the reality of her words started to sink in. 

All of my drawing supplies were gone. Pens and pencils, every scrap of paper and all my notepads and workbooks. Even my bookshelves had been purged. Standing still against my door, I mentally went over every word of the letter. Mrs Wilder had boasted about listening devices being fitted so she would know when I was talking to her son.

She was smart enough to bug my room and yet failed to realise I was faking my Instagram stream.

I was digging through my draws for anything discernible to write on when I caught movement in Casper’s window. Ducking to my knees, I glimpsed the boy next door stumbling inside the room. Mrs Wilder followed, shoving him onto the bed. The way he was moving, staggering, his eyes wide—I knew he was himself.  There was something else. Casper’s arms were pinned behind his back. He was tied up. So much for motherly love. The crazy witch was finally showing her true colours. 

I watched her forcibly sit him on the edge of his bed. She knelt in front of him and took his struggling face into her hands, cradling his cheeks. He spat at her, struggling in his bindings, but Mrs Wilder barely seemed fazed.

Her expression was twisted with desperation for him to submit to her. But that wasn’t what was happening. He was struggling and squirming with everything he had, pulling and yanking at the restraints wrapped around his wrists. I read her lips. I love you. I love you so much, Casper. She was saying it over and over again, before getting to her feet and grabbing the snake-like chord she had carried in with her. Mrs Wilder knew the thing scared him. 

It terrified him. 

Her movement was intentionally slow, fingernails digging into the plastic end. Immediately, Casper shuffled back, his eyes widening with fright. He shook his head. *No*. 

His lips formed the words in a strangled cry I could almost hear through the glass. *Please*. 

I knew his splintered self was aware of his current state. The cavernous hole in the back of his skull where that thing resided. Mrs Wilder could attempt to take it away with brainwashing, but once that thing was out of his head, he was awake and aware of what she was doing to him. Knowing this filled me with hope. I was still in denial of what I had seen. I didn’t want to accept that he was dead—that he was nothing but patchwork flesh and vacant eyes like the other Wilder kids. They had submitted to her. They were under her control.

Casper wasn’t.

I didn’t want to watch, but something kept my gaze glued to the widow as I struggled to breathe, gripping onto my carpet like it was an anchor. Like it could help me catch my breath. Mrs Wilder was forceful this time. Her touch was no longer gentle. Ignoring the boy’s screams, she gripped onto his hair and yanked it back, forcing him to look at her while her other hand holding the chord slid the thing under his shirt, and like it was sentient, like it had a mind of its own, it crept its way up his spine, inserting itself in two places before burying its way into the back of his skull.

I had never seen this thing attach itself to him. I had only ever seen it connected to the back of his head. I had no idea it was like a creature, nestling itself inside the boy’s brain like it was eating its way through him. Casper’s body reacted to the intrusion, jolting like he had been shocked. His head tipped back, his eyes rolling back, lips forming a cry which crumpled when the device turned a light green color, and his expression relaxed. The device had successfully leeched itself onto him, and the boy next door was once again doll-like. 

He blinked once and then again, his lips forming a small smile. Casper sat up with confused eyes and spoke to his mother. He started forwards, and I noticed the light turn red for a second, before flicking back to green. In sync, Casper’s expression looked like it was glitching, a wide and emotionless smile faltering before righting itself. He was fighting it. Either that, or the device was faulty. 

Except I had seen exactly what he was like out of her control. Casper Wilder was a completely different person. I had no doubt this boy wasn’t clamouring to retake his mind. Mrs Wilder didn’t notice. It looked like Casper was asking her what was going on. Mrs Wider knelt in front of him and grasped his hands, squeezing them.

“Stay here.” Her lips stretched in satisfaction mouthed before she stood up slowly and ruffled his hair. “I’ll be right back, okay?” She mouthed, before her head twisted to the window. I flattened myself against my carpet, my heart in my throat. It was almost like she could sense me watching. I stayed hidden until I was sure she was gone. When I slowly raised my head, there was no sign of Mrs Wilder. 

But Casper was staring directly at me. I dived to my feet and hurried to my window—and the boy next door’s gaze followed me. He looked almost frenzied, feral, like a predator tracking its meal. The device was flashing from red to green, his expression contorting with it. I could see the desperation inside him, his wriggling arms trying to free himself. I knew exactly what he was trying to do. Casper was going to yank that thing out. Which would almost certainly kill him if he didn’t know what he was doing. 

That device was connected to his spine too, a technology I had never seen before. I shook my head and mouthed for him to stop, but he was ignoring me, squeezing his eyes shut. 

Fuck. If that thing was in my head, I would want the exact same. But he had to know that tugging it out like an idiot would make things worse. I looked for something to message him with, but everything had been taken. There was nothing to write with. I pressed my index against the glass pane, attempting to write in condensation, but there was nothing. The tip of my finger was wet and smelled potent. Mrs Wilder really had gone to the extreme to make sure I wasn’t communicating with her son.

From the look on Casper's face, he was growing closer to freeing himself with brute force. When he tugged his wrists apart finally, the first thing he did was jump off of the bed and stumble to the window, still attached to the device. 

*You*. Casper’s lips curved in disgust. His eyes narrowed,  and he slammed his fists into the glass.  I jumped back, my gut twisting. *Are you with them?*

*What*? I mouthed back. The more I spoke to the boy underneath the doll, more of his real personality was coming through. *No*!

He folded his arms, his head twitching. 

I suck at lip-reading, but the way he spoke, his twitching mouth perfectly forming each word, I saw his messages in clarity. *You left me*. Casper manically gestured to his door, clawing at his face until his fingernails drew blood. 

*You left me with them!*

*I tried to save you*! I mouthed back.

My gaze flicked to the device still attached to his head, and his fingers grasped at the chord, all the resolve crumbling in his expression.

*Fuck*.

*Need to get it out.*

He dropped to his knees. I sensed his desperation, each word dripping from his lips.

*I need to get it out of my head!*

*It hurts!*

*It… it fucking hurts!*

The boy’s face twisted into an animalistic cry, and he yanked at the chord, ignoring pooling black dripping from his nose. There it was again. That feral urge to get the thing out of his head no matter what. I pressed my palm against the window, jutting my chin at the erratic light struggling between red and green. I struggled to get his attention, stabbing at my own head. “Listen to me.” I mouthed. *Hey! Look at me!*

Casper shook his head. He took a shaky step back. I searched for the stitches on his skin, for rugged flesh and glimpses of patchwork shades of light and dark, but he looked like he always did. Perfect. It was only under candlelight in the Wilder kitchen had I seen his true form. It didn’t make sense to me that two versions of him existed. The one I was seeing, a teenage kid with a perfectly normal body, and his doll-self sitting next to his siblings, the flesh of his neck stitched up. “I can’t do this, Phoebe.” His lips formed the words, and I had to swallow barf.

Tears glistened, and he blinked them back, his eyes flickering and rolling to pearly whites and back to normal. He was trying to stay in control, and that thing was digging deeper. Casper was going to lose either way. His body was nothing but Mrs Wilder’s canvas.

“Casper!” I knocked on my window, manically pointing to my own head. “You can’t pull it out! That thing will kill you!”

Fuck.

He wasn’t listening to me.

I had nothing to draw with, and every time Casper maniacally yanked at the device which was trying and failing to take control, a little piece of me died. He couldn’t see sharp rivulets of black dripping down his face every time he tried to pull at the thing. The damage already done was monumental, but  Casper was making it worse. His writhing hands were clawing at the metal legs attached to his head, when I suddenly became all too aware of what I was holding. I could feel it slick between my fist, the hard-wood of my mother’s favourite carving knife.

It was supposed to be a weapon, but feeling it perfectly moulded into the flesh of my palm, I realised it could also be an instrument to an artist desperate enough. Casper had used his own blood as paint, and despite knowing it was a stupid idea, I didn’t have a choice. Casper was going to kill himself or destroy what was left of his doll-like body. I told myself it wouldn’t hurt, and that was a huge fucking lie to myself.

I have only ever cut myself once while washing the dishes a kid.  Mom had freaked out, bandaging me up and insisting on a hospital visit to make sure I was okay. The cut was tiny. This was… different. This was self-inflicted. 

The second I dug the teeth of the blade into my arm, I regretted it. The pain was searing, and I had to grab something to scream into. The pain was like a vicious burn, a cruel and relentless slicing stabbing into my skin. It hurt. It hurt so fucking much.  Thankfully though, halfway through the first letter, where I had been attempting to carve U WILL DIE into my skin, Casper’s grip on the chord slipped, and the end hit the ground. He seemed to stiffen up. His eyes were wide suddenly, almost catatonic. Thank god. I really didn’t want to permanently ruin my arm to get a message across, but the U I had successfully sliced into several layers of my flesh was burning.

Screaming into an old pair of jeans, I was  aware of pooling scarlet dripping in tiny rivers, streaking down my wrist, then my palms and fingers. The knife dropped from my fingers, and I straightened up, struggling to keep my cool. Initially, I thought Casper’s reaction was because he’d figured out what I had been trying to carve into my arm.

Instead though, his eyes were glued to something behind me. Casper stumbled back, his lips forming words I managed to see. 

“Mom.”

He slammed his fists into the glass. 

"Mom!" 

For a moment I was frozen, before what he was mouthing fully registered.

But Casper wasn’t alone.

Matilda Wilder was behind him, wrapping her arms around his neck, one hand coming to forcefully shove the device in deeper. The boy went limp for a moment, his eyes rolling back, before drooping in her arms. He was still yelling, struggling, but his body wouldn’t move.

And the more he squirmed, pieces of chipped skull and flesh were getting caught on the neck of his t-shirt, blood the shade of ink dripping down his face. Casper’s eyes were unseeing, only alive through flickering man-made light. The realisation hit me like a wave of ice water. 

It didn’t matter what I tried, the boy next door was dead. I was in denial. I wanted to believe that he was still human, but what I was seeing wasn’t human. It was consciousness being forced to accept dead flesh.  And it was torture for him. He was right to try and pull that thing out and end whatever cruel experiment his mother was subjecting him to. 

Casper Wilder was passed saving. 

I thought I was saving him by getting that thing out of his head and back to normal. 

Except there was no normal—and I was a self-righteous child for thinking that was better for him. Casper didn’t need saving. 

He needed to be put down like the rest of his undead siblings. 

But I had come to that conclusion far too late. If it had been just minutes earlier, I would have told him to pull it out. To end his suffering for good. Matilda had a strong grip, easily gagging his cries. Though they weren’t for himself. He was screaming at me. Ripped from my own reverie, I was suddenly aware of the shadow looming behind me, the shadow I hadn’t noticed because the pain was playing with my head, sending my thoughts into a hurricane.

Instead of twisting around, I stared down at thick rivulets of red dripping down my wrist. I was making a mess, I thought dizzily. Mom wouldn’t like that. Fuck. She was going to kill me for getting blood all over her brand new carpet.

“Oh, Phoebe,” Mrs Wilder’s voice was smooth like honey.

I had barely noticed her embrace. It was motherly. Which caught me off guard. Not like she was trapping me. More like a hug. Her face was warm, her breath coming out in sharp pants against the back of my neck. She chuckled, and her grip tightened, her clammy hand suffocating my mouth. “How sweet. I think my son likes you. Now, I know Casper isn’t very well. His body is quite sick due to rejection— but I’ll be fixing that very soon. So, please try and ignore his… erratic behaviour.” 

I took a step back, and she followed me, her spare hand coming to graze over the gash on my arm. She sighed. “Really, Phoebe, I hate you.” She spat into my neck. “I want to drill into you and take you apart like all of my sweet dolls. I want to dress you up in all of the best clothes and braid your pretty hair, but why on earth would I waste a face like yours, hmm?”

I was paralysed as her fingers sifted through my hair and pulled at my cheeks. “Pretty.” She hummed. “Pretty eyes, pretty lips, pretty nose.” Mrs Wilder laughed. She held out her hand and sitting on her palm was a paper doll. My paper doll, which had been clumsily mended with sticky tape gluing its head back onto its doll-torso. Through fraying vision as her palm suffocated my nose and mouth, I watched her crush the doll slowly, crunching it up in her fist—and my body began to fold too, dropping to the ground, my head slamming into the carpet. I couldn’t breathe, my body was on fire. I could feel every bone snapping, but my mouth wasn’t working. “Pretty.” Mrs Wilder continued. She knelt in front of me with the remnants of the doll sitting on the palm of her hand.

“Like my daughter is going to be.”

Her lips stretched into a wide smile, a monstrous grin splitting her face apart. “Really, baby, you should never have stuck your nose in business which wasn’t yours. Because then I might not have properly seen you. Your pretty face, and perfect cheeks, and round brown eyes which I have wanted for a long, long time.” 

The woman sat up with a sigh, while black spots danced in my vision, threatening to plunge me into the dark. Her voice followed me as a wet rag once again found my mouth. “You have no idea how long I have been looking for the perfect parts, sweetie. And now I have them!” She laughed again. “You are quite the gold mine, aren’t you? I think I will start by scooping your eyes out…”

“…Then I will peel off your face…”

The woman’s words faded in and out, and I felt her lift my unresponsive body, forcing me to my feet like a puppet on strings.

She was controlling my body and inflicting pain on me through my doll.

Mom’s paper doll came to my dizzying mind. I’d ripped it to shreds. A sickly paste crept its way up my throat. Her fingers came apart, revealing the half scrunched up doll— and I could breathe again. Her fingernails picked at the doll’s tiny arms, and I felt the ghostly sensation of something stabbing at my skin, digging into the word I had carved into myself. “Don’t hurt yourself, Phoebe. I don’t like scarred flesh.”

Her hand which smelled like rot and filth, clutching the soaked rag was suffocating me, sending me into spiralling oblivion, choking on the stink of pool cleaner and rich lavender. 

That was Mrs Wilder's scent. She smelled like clinical rooms and wildflowers. Mrs Wilder was the opposite of death despite playing around with mangled corpses, transforming flesh into doll pieces. My knees hit the ground once again, my body following. I could still hear Casper's frenzied knocks. When I last saw him, he had managed to claw himself out of his sister’s grasp and to the window. His cries filled with splintered agony, and yet a fake happiness and euphoria being drilled into what should have been a dead brain. Casper was dead, I thought, as the ground began to disappear from underneath me. How was I supposed to save a boy who was already dead? 

The thought hung onto me. I wasn’t passed out for long. When I opened my eyes, my face felt... strange. It felt sore. Like I'd rubbed sandpaper all over my cheeks. Through blurry vision, I saw slithers of late afternoon sunlight peeking through the blinds, and familiar sunshine coloured walls. I was in our kitchen. 

But I couldn't... move. 

There was something restricting my arms-- and when I let out a shriek, my teeth clamped around something which had been forcibly lodged inside my mouth. I knew what it was from the taste of it, an overwhelming aroma filling my mouth with memories from playing in my mother's flower garden as a little kid. 

Roses. 

Freshly picked roses mixing with the taste of my own blood pooling down my lips and chin. Panic struck, and I struggled violently, my gaze flashing to what was in front of me. There was my paper-doll lying on its back. Mrs Wilder had drawn eyes and a mouth curved into the shape of a scream. Next to the doll was a mirror showing me my reflection. My dark hair had been tied back, exposing pale cheeks and shadowed eyes. I looked like shit.

Though that was not what I was looking at.

My gaze was on my own cheeks and nose and forehead, where the witch had scrawled over my skin, like a hyperactive child with finger paint. The ink was red, arrows pointing to my lips, bloated bubbles circling and crossing out which parts she was going to cut, and which parts she was going to leave. The sight was horrifying. Like I was in my own personal nightmare. I spat out the rose and it landed on the ground with a wet sounding smack, and I rocked backwards and forwards in the chair, noticing I had been dressed in plastic overalls over my own clothes. For the blood, I thought. 

She didn’t want to make a mess. 

I screamed, and it was guttural, and I didn’t stop screaming until my throat was aching. The markings on my face felt like finality. They were going to happen. They were itchy, ice-cold on my skin. I noticed Mrs Wilder had bandaged my arm and that sent my stomach heaving, eliciting another screech. "Mom!" I sobbed, kicking my legs.

My feverish eyes snapped to the trash where I dumped my mother’s paper doll. I thought back to my own body folding in on itself, mimicking the doll crushed between Mrs Wilder’s fist.

There was something about the image which set off something feral inside me. I didn’t scream or cry, or struggle. I just stared at the trash can, swallowing sour barf which kept creeping up the back of my throat. I was losing my fucking mind. I can’t explain what I felt like right then, because I have never felt true despair in my life except at this point and the hours following. Like the world was crumbling beneath my feet, like I was being torn into pieces with nobody to put me back together. 

I needed my mom. I needed my mom, and she wasn’t coming. Mom was always there when I was upset or sick. I was scared—and there was nothing left of her but that stupid paper doll I was regretting throwing in the trash.

Mother instinct, huh? 

Bullshit! 

Where was her mother's instinct when I was about to be carved up by our neighbour?

The logical part of me knew my mother’s mind had been played with to benefit Mrs Wilder and her psychic book club. 

But I wasn’t exactly thinking logically at that time. I can’t remember what I was doing when the knock sounded. I think I was staring at the markings on my face and wondering what flaws Mrs Wilder was planning on cutting away. I was spare parts for Matilda, but what was she going to do with the rest of me? “Hello?” The voice was enough to almost send me toppling off of the chair. “Hey, are you okay in there?"

It was a guy’s voice. I recognised it from school.

Gritting my teeth, I willed myself not to scream. “There’s a spare key,” I managed to get out, pulling at the rope restraining my wrists. “There’s a spare key under the brick near the door. Get the key and unlock the door. You need to… you need to get in here and untie me.”

“Untie you?”

His voice sounded oddly close despite him being outside. “Wait, is this some kind of foreplay?”

“No!” I held myself against another screech. “Just get in here. Please.”

I waited for the door to open, but nothing happened and my heart sank.

“Hey!” I cried out, panic creeping its way up my spine. “Hey, are you still there?” I tipped my head back. “Hey! I need… I need help!”

When I was staring at the ceiling, trying and failing to pull my bindings apart, a shadow looming in the doorway made me jump. It was too small to be Mrs Wilder. 

Straightening up, I blinked rapidly, drinking in the figure which bled into a real person. It was a kid from my school. The kid sat in front of me in math class and sometimes twisted around in his chair and asked how my day was going. 

He was smallish with light brown hair, his signature football jersey awkwardly hanging off one shoulder. Harry Markham. The guy spent 99.9% of class with his head in his arms, and when he was awake he could barely sit still, his shoe constantly tapping beats into the floor.

I was used to his bright smile which I was sure was permanently glued to his face—but the kid looked frightened. His eyes were wide, lips twisted in a what-the-fuck-is-going-on? scowl. 

“Uh.” Harry ran his hands through his hair. I noticed he was trembling. He started forwards but seemed to hesitate, twisting around to frown at the door like he was waiting for my assailant to come back.  “What's going on? Did I just walk onto the set of Criminal Minds?”

“How did you…” I trailed off, shaking my head. “You need to untie me!”

His cheeks turned significantly paler. “So, someone just strolled in and tied you up?”

“Something like that.”

"Right."

I couldn’t feel his fingers sifting through the rope, but the restraints were loosening around my wrists.

“Hurry up, Harry.” I managed to get out. “I need to get to my mom.”

“I am. Your wiggling isn’t helping.” 

His voice was edging on hysteria. “And you’re going to tell me what’s going on, right?” He paused. “It’s Harvey, by the way. You’ve sat behind me for four months, and you can’t  remember my name?”

When the ropes fell away, I dove to my feet, scrambling to keep myself balanced. “Do you have your phone?”

Harvey’s expression crumpled. He patted his jeans. “I don’t think so?”

“You don’t think so? You either do or you don’t!”

Struggling to stand, I cursed whatever drugs had been forced into my bloodstream. I had to find my phone.

Harvey scoffed. "Well, I'm sorry!” His tone dripped sarcasm. “I wasn't expecting to be involved in a kidnapping.”

“I’m not the one who has been kidnapped,” I hissed out, rummaging for mom’s phone she left for emergencies.

Harvey followed me awkwardly. “Right. So, who exactly tied you up and drew all over your face?” He situated himself in front of me, his eyes darkening. “Come on, new kid. I need something here. I find you tied up, and you’re just going to leave me completely in the dark?”

I dived over our sofa, lifting up cushions and throwing them onto the floor in frustration. “The kids next door.” I said. “They’re in trouble.”

“You mean the Wilder's?"

Something cold crept down my spine. “You know them?”

Harvey shrugged. “I know of them.” He said. “They never come to school and have a crazy over- protective mother. My mom told me to stay away from them. It’s pretty much a universal rule in town not to talk to Wilder kids. I never see them anyway, so it’s not like it’s hard.”

“That makes sense,” I said. “The police are in on it.”

Inclining his head, Harvey frowned. “In on what?”

It was only when I was holding the severed chord of our landline between my fingers when the gravity of the situation hit me—and the last thing I needed was to pull another kid into it. Harvey was like a puppy-dog, following me around. He was sitting cross legged on the carpet, his wide eyes glued to the phone cord. “That can’t be good,” he whistled. “Wait, what do you mean no police? Are you saying they’re dirty?”

I stopped pacing the room, turning to him. 

"Go home.”

Harvey raised a brow. “That’s not going to happen.”

I was too frustrated to argue with him. “I don’t care what you do,” I said through my teeth. “Just get as far away from here as possible.”

He groaned, resting his head in his arms. “So, you’re about to end up on some Netflix crime documentary, and you expect me to leave?”

“I’m not in the mood for jokes,” I said, growing progressively more frustrated. “I need to find my mom, okay? I need to get out of this fucking town!”

“Yeah, me too.” He lifted his head, shooting me a grin. “Just a few more months, and it’s NCU for me, baby. Full scholarship.”

There was something about Harvey which was bugging me. I twisted around to him. “Why are you here?”

He shrugged, looking uncomfortable. “I heard screaming."

“No. I mean how did you get in?”

“The door was open.” He wandered over to the kitchen table and poked my doll, but it didn’t move, staying on its back.  “Is this like… origami?”

“Don’t touch that.” I said, and seeing my expression, he nodded and took a step back.

“So, you just walked in?” I demanded.

His lip curled. “I’m sorry, did you want me to leave and ignore you? Ignore your high pitched murder screams?”

Instead of yelling back at him, I forced my brain to think through the fog. Harvey was at risk of being pulled into Mrs Wilder’s dollhouse too if he stayed with me, but he was also not an adult. He would believe me about Mrs Wilder. I held my breath.  “Can I show you something?”

Harvey shrugged. “It depends on what it is. I don’t do well with monsters, ghosts, anything from the back rooms or the dark web, or vampires except the chick from Resident Evil.” He dragged a hand through his hair. “Just pretty much anything freaky? Yeah, I don’t do well with freaky— and you look like you’re about to show me something super freaky.” He caught my eye, his lips curving into a smile. “Or this was all a misunderstanding, and you’re about to show me, like… buried treasure…” He trailed off when his gaze caught the bandage on my arm.  

I hadn’t noticed my wound had opened up, intense red seeping through clinical white.

“I’m fine.” I said.

“Have you ever heard of septicaemia?” He mimed drawing his finger across his throat. “It’s the fancy word for blood poisoning.”

I shook my head. “That doesn’t matter right now. I need to find my mom.”

“Uh-huh. Cool, cool, cool. Or we could do the smart thing and, you know, call an adult?”

“No,” I said. “The town are helping her.”

“Helping her… do what?”

A sliver slipped down my spine. There was no way I could describe what I had seen and expect Harvey to believe me.

So, I’d show him.

Gesturing him to follow me, I headed up to my bedroom. Harvey stuck by my side as I dived up the stairs.

“Are you planing on explaining the.. . you know..” He pointed to his own face. “The scribbles.”

“I’ll get to that.”

“So, you’re telling me your neighbor is kidnapping kids and turning them into her children?”  

“Dolls.”

Harvey’s steps quickened. “Wait, what?”

When I reached my room, I wasn’t surprised to find no sign of Casper when I hurried over and pressed my face against the glass of my window. Harvey hovered in the doorway before making his way over. “BTS.” He nodded at a poster on my wall. “How old are you again?”

“That’s from my old house,” I said, relieved to be talking about something else. “The walls in here are too bare so say hello to thirteen year old Phoebe.”

“Phoebe.” His lips quirked into a smile. “That’s your name. I definitely wasn’t waiting for you to tell me.”

I shot him the first smile I’d had in days. “You behind me for four months and can’t remember my name?”

“Harsh.”

Harvey joined me, pressing his face against the pane. “So. What exactly do you need to show me? It’s Friday night, and my friend's birthday. We're taking him to a club for the one-eight."

“It’s Saturday.” I corrected him.

He turned to frown at me, and I noticed his jacket was looking progressively more dishevelled. “Wait, did I blank out my whole night?”

Pointing at Casper’s window, I ignored him. “This is what I wanted to show you.”

I held my breath and waited for movement—and after maybe five minutes of staring out of the window like an idiot, I started to wonder if I truly was losing my mind. I was just looking progressively more crazy as I waited for movement which wasn’t going to come. 

I started to think bad thoughts. 

Had Mrs Wilder done something to him? She did say Casper was ‘sick’ and needed to be fixed, but what exactly did that mean?  Harvey turned to me, his lips curving into a smile. 

“So, what exactly am I supposed to be looking at? Because this feels kinda illegal.”

“Wait for it.”

“Wait for what?” He hissed. “You’re saying your neighbour kidnapped this kid? Wouldn’t she keep him in the basement?”

Opening my mouth to answer him, the words dried up in my throat when there was a flicker of movement through the window. Casper appeared for a moment, stripping off his shirt and grabbing a towel before diving out of his room. I pulled back slowly, my heart in my throat. Again, it was like an illusion. He looked like a normal teenager heading into the shower, all of the stitches and rugged flesh gone.

I expected Harvey to make a sly remark, but when I turned to him, the boy’s expression had completely contorted. “Fuck.” Harvey straightened up, hissing out. He looked like he was in pain for a second, before seemingly snapping out of it. “I know him,” he whispered. “I mean… I knew him? I think I knew him? Fuck. I don’t know!” I watched the boy pace my room, his hands clawing at his hair. The way he was acting reminded me of Casper's freak out. 

“I know him… but I also don’t? Jeez, I can’t remember. It feels like I’m being... stabbed in the.. urgh. Holy shit, my head is killing me. I must have overdone it.” Harvey choked out a hysterical laugh and turned to me, his lips stretched into a pained smile like he was struggling to understand what he was seeing. "He was in my homeroom, and I said maybe two words to him.” My classmate let out a breath, rubbing the back of his head.“Phoebe, this might not be the best time to tell you this, but I’m pretty sure the boy next door is dead.”

Harvey squinted. “He drowned.” He said, but his tone was almost questioning, like he wasn’t sure what he was saying.  “Last winter.”

There it was—and it was enough suck all of the oxygen from my lungs. I was waiting for the confirmation but it was still painful.

This agonising reality was like knives slicing into me. “We have a tradition every year. I mean, we’re a small town with a bunch of kids and life is boring, you know?” The more he was speaking, Harvey was looking progressively sicker, like he was about to collapse. But he pushed through, squeezing his eyes shut. 

“When the town lake freezes over, we carve our names into the ice for good luck. It’s a stupid tradition, but it means something to us—especially kids heading to college.” His eyes blinked open.  “Fuck. It’s like I completely… forgot about him.” Harvey shook his head.

“Anyway. This guy. He was a golden boy, you know? Kind of a dick, but somehow got along with pretty much everyone. He was carving his name into the ice, and this little girl went straight through. So, naturally, he jumped in after her—but neither of them made it. The little girl’s body was found and his never was. The the town went crazy and blamed him for not saving her.”

“But he risked his life!” I found myself hissing out.

“Yeah, try and tell that to a bunch of middle class suburban moms.”

“Who were his parents?”

“Just his mom. She was nice. I remember she used to hand out candy for all of us when we were in kindergarten. When her son died, she never came out of her house. Then people threw rocks at her windows, spray painting 'murderer' on her car.” He shook his head. “Even our school was told we weren’t going to mourn him, because he had caused the death of a little kid. His name was blacklisted. It was pretty fucked up. He didn't even have a funeral."

Harvey prodded between his brows, his lips curling. "The memorial his mom put in her yard was destroyed by this army of Karen’s insisting it was justice for the little girl’s death, when in reality nobody wanted to admit that it was parental neglect which killed her. The crazy bitches blamed it on him. They called him a murderer, convinced he'd done it on purpose because of reports of seeing him dripping wet sitting on his mom's doorstep when she was looking for his body herself. She almost died from hyperthermia diving in there for him."

His mom, I thought dizzily.

Casper, or whoever he was underneath the splintered doll… he had a mother who cared about him.

Who loved him.

Harvey rubbed at his eyes, and I noticed something smeared on the collar of his letterman jacket which hadn’t been there before.

“What’s that on your jacket?”

I don’t think he heard me. “They ran her out of town, and I completely… damn, I forgot about him."

“You’re not saying his name,” I managed to get out, my attention going back to Casper. “Why aren’t you saying his name?”

Harvey frowned. “I thought I did?”

“You didn’t.” I pressed, my gut twisting at Harvey’s pained expression. “You told me everything but his name, and I want to know why.”

 “I… I don’t know.”

“What do you mean you don’t know?” I snapped. Suddenly, I was desperate to know. “You said it yourself. He was in your class!”

“I just forgot his name! That’s normal... right?” Harvey’s gaze caught movement in Casper’s window and he twisted to the window.

“Holy shit, it is him.” He breathed, pressing his palm against the glass. “That’s the boy who drowned.”

The boy next door appeared once more, and Harvey’s eyes followed him—but  this time the chord-like thing was protruding from his head, his body more of a puppet. Casper was on the edge of his bed, and my classmate turned to me, a feral twist of fear in his expression. Harvey's eyes were glued to the thing burrowing its way into the back of Casper’s head with no mercy, while the boy next door sat very still, his eyes completely vacant. 

I thought they were looking through the window before I realised they were instead drinking in oblivion. He couldn't see me. 

Glimpsing Mrs Wilder’s shadow behind Casper’s door, I grabbed for Harvey’s arm, but I missed him and almost toppled over. It was like grasping thin air. 

“Duck!”I hissed out. 

The two of us slammed into my carpet, and I pressed my face into the floor, struggling to breathe. “What...” Harvey finally turned to me with wide, almost unseeing eyes, and I was suddenly paying far too much attention to him, that rumbling question in my mind which had been driving me mad since he'd saved me. 

But I wouldn't entertain it. 

Not yet. 

“What the fuck was that?”
