[The old cracked cell phone was gone](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dqk3px/my_daughter_has_been_doomscrolling_for_fourteen/), left on the doorstep of another family, in order to save my own.

And life had returned to normal...

...At least I thought it had.

Just days after surviving a terrifying encounter with a mysterious app so addictive, that it caused its victims to doomscroll indefinitely until someone else opened it, my eighteen year old daughter, Rebecca, back to her "normal" Gen-Z self, set off for her yearly summer job as a sleepover camp counselor. Which had been something of a tradition, since she was a camper herself.

But two weeks into camp, when I called to check in on her, I was shocked by what the camp director told me.

"Rebecca? We didn't think she was working this year. She didn't show up."

"Didn't show up? You mean, she hasn't been there at all? But I dropped her off two weeks ago?"

My mind began to race. If Rebecca hasn't been at summer camp for the past fourteen days, where has she been?

I began to panic. Calling every one of her friends’ parents until eventually speaking with friend Lisa's mother.

"That's concerning." She said, "Lisa told us she was going on a family vacation with Rebecca, and presumably you?"

Fuck. I thought to myself, realizing that this could only mean one thing. My daughter must have still been fiending for the old cracked cell phone, and set off with her friend Lisa to find it.

But when I began to investigate the situation further, interviewing nearly every parent and classmate I could get a hold of, it became very clear very fast that the situation was far worse than I had anticipated.

According to one friend, Bobby, it turned out that several of her friends and classmates had also gone missing, all of them apparently setting off into the woods, to descend upon an old abandoned train station.

After returning home, I discovered that my wife, who had also been temporarily possessed by the cursed cell phone, had also begun to fiend over it, her teeth chattering, her body covered in sweat.

That's when I knew what I had to do. I had to destroy the old cracked cell phone.

And after locking her away, with her own permission, so that she too wouldn't set out looking for the app, I did just that, following in the footsteps of my daughter and her friends, to the abandoned train station in the woods

After hopping a chain link fence, and  trespassing, I eventually found the entrance to the station, its facade crumbling, its surface covered in spray paint.

I looked down at the crowbar I was holding, an instinct grab on my way out of the house, and gripped it in my hand, as my body trembled in fear, and adrenaline.

If dealing with two individuals possessed by the phone had been a terrifying ordeal, then I could only imagine what would come of confronting five or even ten of them.

Luckily, it was only one possibly for one cursed phone, and one possessed person to be inside at any given time. I reasoned.

But when I finally made my way inside the old train station, using the light of my cell phone to guide me through its cobwebbed and musty halls, and arrived at the train platform, I discovered...

...That I was very wrong.

There wasn't one cell phone. There were many. Each one held in the hand of what must have been ten of my daughter's friends, and herself, as they all scrolled away, their bodies pale and emaciated, from having not eaten in days.

Someone must have found a way to copy the app to other phones. I thought to myself, before walking through the station, as they all swiped away, and ignored me.

Eventually, I stopped at Becca, who, sure enough, was sitting next to her friend Lisa, her eyes fixated on the app, as she doomscrolled away.

"Becca," I whispered, looking back to see if anyone else had heard me. But her friends were too hypnotized by their own phones to care.

That is, until I tried to pry the phone out of my daughter's hand.

"Rebecca, just let go!" I said, as I managed to pull it out of her grasp, and step far enough away, so that I could toss it to the floor and smash it to bits with the crowbar.

Rebecca howled out in pain, as if my blows to the phone had struck her instead, passing out when the phone was destroyed.

I placed the broken phone in my pocket.

Suddenly, all of the teenagers stopped doomscrolling on their phones, and looked up. Their hollow eyes locked in on one thing now and one thing only.

That's when they all stood up, and began hobbling over in my direction, like zombies in the night, as they growled and hissed, their arms extended, clawing away at the air.

I picked up my daughter, and began backing away to what I thought was safety, but suddenly heard another of her possessed friends emerge from the darkness behind me and claw at my back, his nails tearing through my shirt and digging through my back.

"Aaaaaargghh!" I cried out, remembering the pain I had felt when my daughter had done the same to face just a couple weeks prior.

"Give us the phone

Not knowing what else to do, I temporarily placed Becca down, hopped into the old train tracks, and threw her body off her shoulder, carrying her off through the dark tracks as Becca's possessed friends chased behind me.

—

By the time I got to the end of the structure, where the tracks ran through a tunnel and into daylight, the mob of cursed teenagers had nearly gained on me, my speed slowed by carrying my daughter.

I had nearly made my way out, when standing there, at the entrance of the tunnel, was another of her friends, silhouetted by the light behind him.

I looked down at the crowbar and thought about what I might have to do to get my daughter to safety.

But when I got closer, I realized it wasn't one of the possessed teens, but instead Bobby, the very friend who had told me about the train station in the first place.

"Come on, Mr. Silver!" Bobby called out, as I made my way over to him, and he helped me carry my daughter off into the woods.
