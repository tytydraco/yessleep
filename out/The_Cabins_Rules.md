When the cabin listing popped up on the app, it was like a mirage: secluded, affordable, and ridiculously well-reviewed. I needed an escape—a break from the suffocating office politics and the suffocating silence of my one-bedroom apartment. The timing was too perfect to question.

I booked it for a week.

The directions emailed by the host were meticulous, almost obsessive. “Arrive before sundown,” they warned. “Follow the path from the gravel road exactly as described.” The instructions went on for paragraphs, emphasizing that I must never attempt shortcuts or rely on GPS.

When I pulled up to the gravel road in my old Civic, the sun was just beginning its lazy descent. The surrounding woods were dense, and the shadows pooled like spilled ink. The cabin sat deeper within, only reachable by a winding dirt path flanked by towering pines. I followed the handwritten map, tires crunching over fallen leaves. When the cabin came into view, I was struck by its simplicity: a weathered wooden structure with a wraparound porch and a single light glowing warmly through its window.

But something about it didn’t sit right. It felt… expectant.

Inside, the place was spotless but oddly sterile, as if no one had lived there for decades despite its cozy furnishings. The air smelled faintly of pine and something else—something metallic. On the coffee table sat a laminated sheet of paper titled **Rules for Guests** in bold, block letters.

I laughed at first. Rules? For a cabin rental? But as I skimmed the list, my amusement curdled into unease.

1. **Never leave the cabin after dark.**
2. **If you hear someone knocking at the door, DO NOT answer it.**
3. **If you hear footsteps inside the cabin at night, stay in bed and pretend to sleep.**
4. **Do not open the basement door under ANY circumstances.**
5. **Burn the candle on the mantel every night. Extinguish it at sunrise.**
6. **Check under the bed before you sleep.**

The last rule was handwritten at the bottom in shaky cursive: **Do not insult the cabin.**

The host had mentioned nothing about these… quirks. I chalked it up to an elaborate prank or some local superstition meant to spook tourists. Still, something in me hesitated to ignore them outright.

The first night, I followed the rules out of morbid curiosity. I lit the candle, its wax releasing a faint lavender scent, and double-checked under the bed for no other reason than to feel less ridiculous. It was empty.

Outside, the woods were alive with the rustle of leaves and distant animal calls. Inside, the silence was oppressive, broken only by the occasional creak of the floorboards—settling, I told myself. But as the hours crawled by, I began to feel watched. The windows, though draped, seemed to hum with a presence just beyond the glass.

At 1:13 a.m., the knocking started.

It wasn’t loud—just a soft, rhythmic tap-tap-tap against the front door. My breath hitched. The logical part of me screamed to ignore it. Still, my hand hovered over the bedside lamp. *No,* I thought. *Stay in bed. Pretend to sleep.*

The knocking continued for what felt like an eternity before stopping abruptly. The silence that followed was heavier than any sound.

By the second day, I was already on edge. The cabin’s isolation, which I’d once craved, now felt suffocating. Even mundane tasks like making breakfast felt charged, as if I were being monitored. At times, I thought I saw movement in my peripheral vision—a shadow darting past the window, a shape reflected in the glass.

Around noon, I decided to explore the property. The fresh air might clear my head, I reasoned. The woods stretched endlessly, and the occasional bird call was a comforting reprieve from the cabin’s stifling atmosphere. But as I wandered farther, I noticed something strange: no matter which direction I walked, I always seemed to end up back at the cabin. Paths looped inexplicably. Landmarks I swore I’d passed minutes ago reappeared.

By the time the sun dipped below the trees, I was back on the porch, panting and disoriented.

The second night was worse.

I lit the candle, its flame flickering violently despite the stillness of the room. As I settled into bed, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was under it. I knew I’d checked earlier, but the thought gnawed at me until I couldn’t resist. I leaned over, heart hammering, and peered beneath.

It was empty.

Relief washed over me until I heard it: faint footsteps above, slow and deliberate. The cabin didn’t have an attic—or so I thought. My chest tightened as the footsteps moved closer, down the hall toward my room.

I squeezed my eyes shut, remembering the rule. *Pretend to sleep.*

The door creaked open.

My breath caught as something moved into the room. I could feel its presence, its weight pressing the air thinner. My back was to the door, and I didn’t dare turn. It stopped inches from the bed, and the candle’s light dimmed as if sucked away.

Minutes stretched into hours—or maybe it was seconds. Eventually, the air shifted, and I heard the faintest whisper: “Good.”

The presence withdrew. The door clicked shut.

The third day, I wanted to leave. I packed my bags, shoved the rules into my pocket, and loaded the car. But when I turned the ignition, the engine sputtered and died. I tried again and again, but the car refused to start. My phone had no signal, and the cabin didn’t have a landline.

Defeated, I trudged back inside. As I stepped through the door, I froze.

The basement door, which had been locked since my arrival, was ajar.

A cold draft wafted up, carrying a faint, foul stench. The rules echoed in my mind: *Do not open the basement door under ANY circumstances.*

I should’ve closed it and walked away. But curiosity—stupid, reckless curiosity—propelled me forward. Gripping a flashlight, I descended the creaking stairs. The smell grew stronger, a mix of mildew and decay. At the bottom, the beam illuminated a dirt floor scattered with strange markings—symbols carved into the ground, concentric circles, and lines forming a chaotic pattern.

In the center lay a bundle of cloth.

I crouched, hesitating, and then pulled back the fabric.

A human jawbone stared back at me, yellowed and cracked. Panic surged, and I scrambled backward, dropping the flashlight. In the dark, I heard it: a low, guttural growl that wasn’t human.

That night, I burned the candle for hours, watching the flame dance as shadows writhed on the walls. I couldn’t sleep. The cabin felt alive—its groans and creaks no longer random, but deliberate, as if it were breathing, watching, waiting.

At 3:00 a.m., the knocking returned. Louder this time. Insistent. I buried my head under the blankets, tears streaming down my face. But then came the voice.

“Please, let me in,” it whimpered. “It’s so cold out here.”

It sounded like a child. But I knew better. My fingers clutched the knife I’d brought to bed, trembling as the voice grew desperate.

“Why won’t you help me? Don’t you care?”

The knocking turned to pounding, shaking the door on its hinges. I closed my eyes and prayed for morning.

When the sun finally rose, the knocking stopped.

By the final day, I was a shell of myself. Sleep-deprived, paranoid, and haunted, I sat on the porch clutching the rules. I should’ve left when I had the chance. Now, the cabin felt like a trap, a hungry thing that had lured me in.

The candle on the mantel burned low, its wax pooling and hardening in jagged shapes. As twilight descended, I glanced at the damp patch in the ceiling above the bed. It had turned a deep crimson.

I survived the week. Barely.

When I handed the keys back to the agent, she smiled politely and asked, “How was your stay?”

I almost told her everything. But when I looked into her eyes, I saw something that stopped me cold: recognition. She knew. They all did.

“It was… fine,” I muttered, and walked away.

The cabin still haunts my dreams. Its rules echo in my mind, a grim litany I’ll never forget. I should’ve known better. Some escapes aren’t worth the price.

But I followed the rules.

And I lived.

For now.
