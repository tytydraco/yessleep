For a long time, I feel I’m not there. I do things, but it’s not me doing them. What is me? I don’t know. But I remember the feeling that I’m me. I don’t have it now. 

It may sound like depression but that’s not it. 

My twenties were difficult. All of my choices contributed to it. The first twenty years of my life felt so secure as if nothing could ever break the status quo and change me. That was wrong, and the next decade was mostly filled with alcohol, some lighter drugs, a bad relationship, a discovery that I had a violent side, chaos and insecurity about what I could even do in my life. 

After one particularly bad night, I was struck by the awareness that the life I knew and loved finished, that I could never return to it again. In a horrible drunk fight, I hit my girlfriend and then went out to aimlessly walk through the city just so I didn’t have to be alone with myself. 

The suicide at that time seemed appealing, but not easy. The problem was, I didn’t want to hurt myself. I didn’t even want to destroy myself. I wanted to save myself from destruction and the erosion caused by life. I wanted everything to stop, the consequences, the actions, the disappointments, the pain, just to disappear. When that’s your mentality, it’s not easy to hurt yourself. Everything violent and painful isn’t an option, and everything gentle and comforting leaves too much time for fear and postponement. 

But guided by this adrenaline rush and rage, I was ready for a quick solution. Something banally easy like a jump off a bridge. And as I was walking towards that bridge, at least at that moment convinced I was going through with it, in some spasm of insanity, my head boiling, I didn’t even notice I was followed. Only when I stopped and looked down, she spoke. 

She said she knew what I wanted, but that I was lucky tonight. That she could help me. That she’ll make one wish come true. 

I laughed, why not, I told her I heard that joke before. I’ll eat her cunt and she’ll tell me “oh honey, aren’t you too old to believe in fairies?” or whatever it was we were pretending to be. 
Which sounded perfectly acceptable. 

She told me it didn’t matter whether I believed her or not. That I simply had to accept the deal. She will make my wish come true, and I’ll give her my soul. 

I asked her, “what is a soul?” She said she didn’t know, so she wanted mine. 
She asked me what I wanted. I told her I didn’t know. 
I asked her who she was. She said she was a demon. 
It was all so extremely ridiculous but so was my life so I said cool, let’s do it, without any conviction. 

After she left, there wasn’t any chance left that I’d dare to jump. The rage passed and with it my resolve. I went back to my apartment.
Years have passed since that weird encounter. Life’s been better, healthier, I drink only sometimes, I have a stable job and a better apartment. I’m single but I meet someone, sometimes. Those crazy emotions that make me want to punch through a wall no longer exist in me, I have no reason for them. 

But more and more, I feel I’m not there. That this isn’t just a phase, but that I’m really not there. 

What did I lose? What is a soul?

Do I feel this way because I lost it, or because of the wish I made? What nonsense, it was all a stupid game. Maybe I’m just bored, or looking for a reason. 

I decided to get drunk after a long time. Not alone this time, this time something called me out. To a bar.

I am drinking and checking out groups of girls who drink and laugh, or girls on dates with guys. I’m not desperate, as if I know this night is a game and things will work out the way they will without any need to force it. I drink and I wait, and then I see a girl. She’s blond and good-looking, she’s not alone but with a couple of girls. It seems they were work colleagues based on their clothes, came out for a happy hour. She doesn’t seem too interested in them, and while with each round they get more and more enthusiastic, she becomes more alienated. The band is playing cliche rock repertoire, the crowd is singing along the drunker they get. Everyone knows all the words. There’s something so funny about everyone singing “I don’t belong here.” I guess they do.

I can see that she also wants to die in that same passive, indecisive way that really wants a chance to live. I wait as she gets sadder and lonelier throughout the night.

She left the bar alone while her colleagues danced. I follow her, she’s not even aware. She’s very drunk, can barely walk. She looks good but that night no one except for me seems to notice her. Maybe sadness is a repulsive force. 

I don’t think she’d try to kill herself on purpose, but I’m compelled to keep following her. In her drunken clumsiness she slams into some guy who just looked right through her, she apologized, but he already walked away with his friends as if she was a nobody. That’s how she’s feeling now like she doesn’t even exist. She’s crying. I know the emotions that keep a hold of her and push her towards the road where cars drive carelessly, this is no place for crossing but I see she’ll just keep walking ahead and the cars can go fuck themselves or fuck her up. 

Before she got a chance to play this take on Russian roulette, I spoke up. “This is your lucky night.”

She got startled, of course, since she had no idea how close I was to her. 

“Jesus christ” she mumbled, but the look on her face told me it didn’t matter, that she was up for it since she had nothing better to do. “I’ll make your wish come true,” I told her. “You just have to agree to give me your soul.”


She started laughing, and then I did too. “This is the most original pickup line I’ve heard all week,” she said. “Fine, I’ll give you my soul. Can you make me exist?”

I woke up the next day, she was by my side. I felt better already. You need to have a soul. 

The feeling of absolute emptiness was gone, I didn’t need any therapy or meds. Or my old soul, that demon can take it. I think I did the right thing when I told her “I want to be like you.”

The girl wakes up too. Her eyes are red and she looks at me. She curses herself and life, gets dressed and leaves. She feels empty and hungover, but she’ll see that this emptiness won’t go away. That it’s deeper than the sadness and loneliness she felt before. It won’t be easy to exist without a soul. But what is a soul?
