The city of Hollow Creek had always been a quiet place—until the demon arrived. Its name, Azrael, was unspoken in the underworld, for it had broken a law no demon dared challenge: it sought to live among humans.

Azrael had grown weary of the infernal realm, tired of endless torment and mindless destruction. Fascinated by human emotions, their fleeting lives, and their ability to love, Azrael wanted to experience it all firsthand. So, one night, it crossed the veil and slipped into the body of a dying man—a reclusive drifter who no one would miss. This way, Azrael could take his place without raising suspicion.

The demon was careful to suppress its dark powers, masking the stench of sulfur and disguising its eyes, which burned like embers. It learned quickly how to smile, how to speak, and even how to fake human kindness. The people of Hollow Creek found the man—now inhabited by Azrael—peculiar but harmless. They would nod politely as he passed, exchanging brief greetings with their strange new neighbor.

Azrael was thrilled. It could taste the cool air, feel the warmth of the sun, and hear the soft rustling of leaves. Every sensation was a new experience, far different from the acrid flames of its old home. But living among humans came with a price—something it had not anticipated.

The hunger.

At first, it was faint, a gnawing sensation that could be ignored. But as the days turned into weeks, the hunger grew. Azrael tried to silence it by indulging in human food, yet nothing could satisfy the aching void within. It wanted more than mere sustenance; it craved souls.

Azrael had promised itself it wouldn’t give in. It would not harm the humans it admired so much. But as time passed, the demon’s control began to slip. Late at night, it would wake from strange dreams, finding itself standing over the bed of its neighbor, eyes glowing and fingers twitching with dark energy. It would retreat to the safety of its home, clawing at its own skin, trying to remember why it had come to this world.

One night, the hunger became unbearable. Azrael found itself wandering into the local bar, where a few townsfolk gathered after work. The atmosphere was warm, the laughter infectious, but the demon couldn’t feel any of it. All it could sense were the souls, glowing faintly beneath the fragile shells of their bodies.

A woman named Clara approached Azrael, offering a friendly smile. She was kind, asking if he was okay, noticing the strange, distant look in his eyes. Her voice was soothing, her concern genuine—and that was when Azrael snapped.

The demon grabbed her wrist, feeling the pulse of her life force surging through her veins. It tried to stop itself, but the hunger overpowered reason. The room fell silent as the lights flickered. Clara’s eyes widened in terror as her very essence began to drain away, drawn into the demon’s insatiable void.

But just as her soul began to unravel, Azrael released her. The lights returned to normal, the other patrons blinked, confused by the momentary blackout. Clara stumbled backward, shaken but unharmed, and the demon fled into the night.

Azrael knew then that it could never live among humans. It could never be what it wanted. Its hunger, its true nature, would always betray it.

The next morning, the townsfolk found the drifter's house abandoned, a thick smell of sulfur lingering in the air. No one knew where he had gone, but Hollow Creek felt lighter, as though some oppressive weight had been lifted. 

Far away, in the shadows of a forgotten forest, Azrael crouched beneath the moonlight, its burning eyes filled with sorrow. It had tried to be human. It had tried to belong.

But a demon could never truly escape its own darkness.

The demon's failure haunted it as it wandered further from Hollow Creek, deeper into the forgotten places of the world where human presence was a distant memory. In the heart of an ancient forest, where the trees seemed to whisper the secrets of ages long passed, Azrael brooded. It had been a mistake, trying to be human. Its very nature was built on destruction, on feeding from the fear and suffering of others. But despite its monstrous urges, Azrael couldn’t shake the yearning to belong.

Weeks passed in solitude. It stayed away from towns and villages, not trusting itself near humans anymore. But every night, the hunger gnawed. It grew sharper, more demanding, until Azrael could no longer ignore it. It could smell the souls of nearby animals—deer, birds, even insects—but they didn’t satisfy its needs. No, Azrael craved human souls. Nothing else could compare.

The forest began to wither around it. Trees shriveled, animals fled, and the land itself seemed to decay in the demon’s presence. The corruption was spreading, a manifestation of the darkness Azrael fought so hard to suppress. One evening, while the sun sank beneath a blood-red sky, the demon came to a decision. If it couldn’t live among humans, perhaps it could study them from afar. Perhaps, with enough observation, it could learn to suppress the hunger entirely, to understand humanity on a deeper level without risking another slip.

Azrael ventured to the edge of a small, isolated village nestled between two mountains. The place was peaceful, untouched by the chaos of the outside world. Perfect, Azrael thought. From a nearby cave, it could watch the villagers without interacting with them. Days turned into weeks, and Azrael observed them go about their lives—children playing, couples laughing, the elderly sitting by fires and telling stories.

The demon grew fascinated again, especially by a young boy named Elias. The boy seemed different from the others—quieter, with a strange sadness in his eyes that Azrael recognized. Loneliness. The boy spent most of his time alone, drawing shapes in the dirt or sitting by the river that ran along the village’s edge. His father had died in an accident years ago, and his mother worked long hours in the fields, leaving Elias to his own devices.

Azrael saw something of itself in the boy. They were both outsiders, unable to connect with the world around them. A part of the demon ached, not with hunger but with empathy—a feeling so foreign it took a moment to recognize it.

One night, unable to resist, Azrael approached the village under the cover of darkness. It moved silently, slipping between shadows, until it found Elias sitting by the riverbank, staring into the water. The boy was alone, as usual, and Azrael hesitated for a moment before revealing itself.

“Why do you sit here every night?” Azrael asked, its voice softer than it had intended.

Elias didn’t startle. He didn’t even turn to look. “Because the river listens,” the boy replied. “People don’t.”

Azrael sat beside him, careful to hide its glowing eyes in the dim light. “The river doesn’t speak.”

“No,” Elias agreed, “but it understands.”

The two sat in silence for a while, the sound of the water flowing around them. For the first time in centuries, Azrael felt a strange peace. It was as though the boy’s loneliness mirrored its own, and in that shared isolation, they both found an odd sense of comfort.

From then on, Azrael visited the boy each night. They talked, or sometimes just sat in silence. Elias never questioned Azrael’s strange appearance or the coldness that seemed to hang in the air when the demon was near. Azrael, in turn, never revealed its true nature, though it knew it couldn’t keep the secret forever. The hunger was always there, lurking beneath the surface, growing harder to ignore with each passing night.

But the more time Azrael spent with Elias, the more it realized something extraordinary—the hunger didn’t seem as strong around the boy. It was still there, of course, but muted, dulled by something else. The demon couldn’t explain it, but in Elias’s presence, the darkness within felt… manageable. It began to believe that maybe, just maybe, it had found a way to coexist.

That illusion shattered one fateful night.

Azrael arrived at the river to find Elias missing. Panic surged through the demon. It searched the village, slipping between homes, its senses heightened. Then it saw the glow—faint, in the distance, flickering behind a barn on the far side of town.

A group of villagers had gathered, surrounding a figure on the ground. Azrael’s heart—if it had one—seized. Elias lay there, unmoving, his mother kneeling beside him, sobbing. The boy’s body was cold, pale. A fever had taken him suddenly, a sickness no one had seen coming.

The hunger surged inside Azrael, overwhelming it in a wave of rage and sorrow. It had felt close to something, some kind of connection, and now that had been ripped away. Without thinking, without caring anymore, the demon stepped forward, revealing itself in full to the villagers. Its eyes blazed, and shadows curled around its form like living tendrils of smoke.

The villagers recoiled in horror, but Azrael didn’t care. It reached out toward Elias’s body, feeling the faint, fading remnants of the boy’s soul. It was too late to save him, but it wasn’t too late to claim what remained.

As the boy’s soul slipped from his body, Azrael caught it. But instead of consuming it, the demon held it gently, cradling the fragile light. In that moment, it realized the truth: it had never wanted to devour souls—it had wanted to be connected to them, to feel the warmth of life. 

But for a demon, that connection could only ever end in destruction.

Azrael released Elias’s soul, letting it pass on, and with it, any hope it had of finding peace among the humans.

The villagers chased the demon from the town, brandishing torches and weapons, but Azrael didn’t fight back. It fled into the night, disappearing into the wilderness once more.

It knew now that it would never belong. Its hunger was eternal, its nature inescapable. But as it wandered the earth, it carried with it the memory of Elias—a small, fragile light in the endless darkness of its existence. And for a demon, that was more than it ever deserved.

Azrael wandered far, deeper into the wilderness where no human foot had ever dared to tread. The forests gave way to jagged mountains, the skies darkened with perpetual storm clouds, and the air grew thin and cold. The demon’s form began to waste away, its physical body unraveling under the weight of its internal struggle. It no longer resembled the human disguise it had once worn—now, it was a thing of shadows, its skin translucent, and its once fiery eyes dim.

But the hunger remained, gnawing at Azrael’s soul, relentless. It had spared Elias, had resisted the urge to feed on him even when the boy’s soul was ripe for the taking. And for what? To feel more human? To taste the fleeting sensation of compassion? None of it had changed anything. Azrael was still a demon, and the hunger was still insatiable.

One night, as Azrael lay beneath a crumbling cave, a voice drifted through the cold winds. It was faint at first, like a whisper carried from a great distance. But as it drew nearer, the voice grew clearer, more insistent. It wasn’t just a voice—it was many voices, layered upon one another, speaking in unison.

"Azrael… Azrael…"

The demon stirred, raising its head. The voices were familiar, voices from the infernal realm. The other demons had found it.

From the shadows of the cave emerged three figures, each one more grotesque than the last. Their forms twisted and rippled with black fire, eyes burning like coals, mouths filled with jagged teeth. They circled Azrael like vultures, their laughter echoing through the cavern.

"You thought you could escape, didn’t you?" the first one sneered, its voice dripping with malice. "Thought you could play at being human."

"Foolish," said the second, its long, serpentine body coiling around a nearby boulder. "We warned you, Azrael. You don’t belong in their world."

The third demon, larger than the others, loomed over Azrael, its eyes glowing with cruel delight. "Did you really believe you could suppress the hunger? That you could defy your nature?"

Azrael said nothing, its dim eyes fixed on the ground. It had known this day would come. It had known it couldn’t run from the other demons forever.

"You’re weaker now," the first demon hissed, its claws scraping the cave floor as it moved closer. "Starving. Broken."

"Pathetic," the second spat. "Look at you. Reduced to this miserable husk, all because you wanted to feel something like *them.*"

The third demon knelt beside Azrael, its massive hand gripping Azrael’s chin, forcing it to look up. "We’re here to take you back, Azrael. To remind you of who you are. You can’t live among humans. You are not one of them. You *feed* on them. And it’s time you accepted that."

Azrael’s eyes flickered with a trace of defiance. It tried to pull away, but the demon’s grip tightened, its claws digging into Azrael’s flesh. 

"You will *return* with us, or we will drag you back in pieces," the demon growled.

For a moment, Azrael felt the familiar pull of the infernal realm, the lure of its old life, the promise of power and freedom from the constant battle against the hunger. It could return, surrender to its nature, and never have to fight again. The other demons were right—Azrael was weak now, starving, lost.

But then, a single memory surfaced: Elias, sitting by the river, his soft voice carrying over the water as he spoke of loneliness, of being different. Of wanting to belong.

Azrael’s eyes flared with a sudden intensity, a burst of fire that startled the other demons. It pulled away from the third demon’s grasp, rising to its feet, its shadowy form solidifying as a faint glow emanated from within.

"No," Azrael rasped, its voice shaking but resolute. "I may not be human… but I am not like you."

The first demon snarled, leaping forward, its claws aimed at Azrael’s throat. But Azrael moved faster, dodging the attack and striking back with a burst of dark energy. The demon howled in pain as the blast sent it crashing into the cave wall.

The second demon hissed, coiling around Azrael in an attempt to crush it, but Azrael’s power surged once more, tendrils of shadow ripping through the serpentine body and throwing the demon aside.

The third demon, now enraged, charged at Azrael with a roar, its massive fists swinging wildly. Azrael stood its ground, channeling all of its remaining strength. Just as the demon was about to strike, Azrael released a pulse of energy, a wave of pure darkness that exploded outward, sending the demon flying backward, crashing through the cave entrance and into the storm outside.

Azrael stood alone in the shattered cave, its form flickering, barely holding together. It had won, for now. But the hunger was stronger than ever, threatening to consume it entirely. The other demons would be back, and they would not stop until Azrael was dragged back to the underworld.

Weakened and exhausted, Azrael stumbled from the cave, the winds howling around it. The demon’s thoughts drifted once more to Elias, to the boy’s fragile light, to the connection it had felt, however brief.

It couldn’t go back. But it couldn’t stay here, either. The human world was no longer safe, not for a creature like Azrael.

As it wandered further into the mountains, Azrael made a silent vow. If it couldn’t live among humans, if it couldn’t experience their world without destroying it, then it would dedicate the rest of its cursed existence to one thing: protecting them. Not from itself, but from others like it.

The infernal realm would continue to send its demons to the human world, to feast on souls, to spread chaos. But Azrael would be there, waiting in the shadows. A fallen demon, forever hungry, forever out of place—but determined to guard the light it could never truly possess.

Azrael knew that it could never be saved. But perhaps, in its own twisted way, it could save others.
