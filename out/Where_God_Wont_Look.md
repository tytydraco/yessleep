Deep in a forest, there was a teenage boy walking. He looked to be about 16; a faint mustache and patchy acne decorated his face. As he walked, the leaves under his black sneakers crunched and the ambiance of the wind blowing uneased him. Small rays of moonlight were able to pierce through the trees’ thick leaves, yet the forest stayed dim and bleak. The young man was constantly looking over his shoulder with every small noise, as if he was frightened by the thought of there being someone else in this forest.

Then with swiftness he pulled out a pack of Marlboro Reds and rested a cigarette between his lips. Shoving the pack back into his pocket, he pulled out a bright blue lighter. The lighter flickered multiple times before he successfully sustained a flame. His surroundings lit up with red and yellow light as he put the flame to his mouth. Stuffing the lighter back in his pocket, he strode on, taking deep breaths of smoke as he walked.

His black sweatpants and hoodie made him practically invisible to anyone that could be watching him in this dark forest. But of course the young man thought he was all alone. As he walked deeper into the moonlit forest he heard a faint sound. He immediately stopped walking. Holding his breath he strained his ears to hear where the sound may have come from. After cautiously turning his head side to side, he relaxed and decided to keep walking.

A few minutes of anxious walking passed and he hadn’t heard anything. Taking a long pull from his cigarette, he almost felt at ease, but then he heard it. A high pitched, drawn-out wail echoed from deep within the forest. Frozen, the boy stared in the direction of where the noise came from. He could feel his heartbeat pulse through his temples. He waited a few seconds in silence, then another desperate wail pierced the air, this time a little louder. The boy, absolutely terrified, didn’t know what to do. Then he made a decision.

He started walking once again, but this time toward the noise. With bravery in each step, cigarette trembling, he trudged forward. The wails became louder and louder and he could hear faint crying and sobbing. There was a deep sadness beneath every cry and moan that he heard. Then the boy stopped, nearing only feet away from the source of all the noise. His cigarette fell from his lips as his mouth widened in shock. He couldn’t believe what he was seeing.

Below him, in the middle of the forest, was a naked baby. Covered in mud and leaves, its distraught face kept crying and screaming. Its limbs flailed around dramatically, splashing around mud as it did. Its face was covered in tears, and its eyes were red, as if it had been crying for hours. The young man, terrified, felt an eerie sensation come from the baby. Not knowing what else to do, the boy ran away, screaming.
