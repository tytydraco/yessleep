People say Moscow rests on stone and concrete.
But that is not true. Beneath all that, there is another world.
One that wasn't meant for us.

I've worked in the Moscow Metro for over a decade, fixing power lines, walking tunnels most people do not even know exist. Nothing ever scared me down there. Until one night near Sportivnaya station.

There is an old service corridor I'd passed hundreds of times.
That night, a faint light was coming from it.
I walked closer and saw a door that should've been sealed since the Soviet days. The edges had been cut open, the steel bent, still warm to the touch.

Inside, the air was thick with the smell of oil, rust and something else. Something rotten.
The tunnel beyond was wide, like a second metro line, but older. The walls were covered in faded Soviet slogans, words eaten by time. My flashlight picked up scratches, initials, numbers, and one date. Today's date.

Then I heard it.
A rumble. Distant, deep, rolling through the dark like thunder.
A train.

That made no sense. There are no active lines here. No power. Nothing.

The sound grew until an old train appeared out of the black, matte and unmarked. It stopped in front of me and the doors slid open with a slow metallic sigh.

I stepped inside because something inside me moved before I could think.

The carriage smelled of dust and rubber. Every seat had a gas mask on it, lined up like waiting heads. Some masks were new, some cracked and yellow. The lights flickered and the intercom spat static.

Sleduyushchaya stantsiya sekretnaya

It said the same thing over and over until the words shredded into a scream.

In the window reflection I saw a man in a Soviet officer's uniform. His skin was pale, almost blue. Black liquid trickled from his mouth. His eyes were white, empty. When I turned there was no one in the seat behind me, only a dark wet patch spreading across the cushion.

The lights went and came back and the gas masks fell one by one onto the floor with soft thuds. Then the breathing started. Not a human breath, more like something wet being forced through rubber. It filled the carriage, slow and steady and in time like a chorus.

Footsteps followed, boots on metal, marching down the corridor. Shadows in uniforms filled the aisle and kept coming.

Then it was dark. Everything blacked out and in that blackness something breathed hot against my ear and whispered Ты опоздал

You are too late.

I woke up on the platform at Sportivnaya. My flashlight was smashed. My watch stopped at 03:15. My boots were covered in powdery black dust that rubbed off onto the tiles.

I told the crew and they laughed, said I'd nodded off on shift. Maybe I did. Maybe I dreamed it. All I know is that sometimes, when I take the last train home, I still hear that low rumble far beneath the tracks.

If you ever hear it too, don't get on.

Someone is already waiting inside.
