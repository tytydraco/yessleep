I moved in with an old friend a few months ago mostly for weed and cheap rent. He’s not your average roommate. He’s 60. I’m 20. Not exactly the sitcom setup. But I’ve known him a long time. Let’s call him Cal.

Cal’s always been… out there. He’s got this grizzled Vietnam-vet-meets-coffeehouse-prophet vibe. Most days he just sat on the back porch with a joint, talking about how cops were fascists and how the Anunnaki already control the world through hidden frequencies. I used to laugh it off. I’d bring over a few grams, he’d go off on rants about moon pyramids and resonance fields, and I’d just let him talk.

He was harmless. At least I thought he was.

That started to change a couple weeks ago. He stopped going outside. Started covering the windows with aluminum foil. I came home one night and all the mirrors in the house were turned around. I asked him why, and he said:

“Mirrors are gateways. You stare long enough, they start lookin’ back.”

He wouldn’t look me in the eye after that.

A few days later, I woke up around 3 a.m. and found him standing in the middle of the living room, perfectly still. No lights. Just standing. Not facing me. Not really facing anything. Like his body had just been set there and left running on idle.

“Cal?” I called out.

Nothing.

I stepped closer. His breathing was slow — like too slow. I don’t even know how to explain it. Every inhale felt like it took a minute. His arms were stiff at his sides, hands curled slightly, like he was holding something invisible.

Then he whispered something. Real quiet. I had to lean in to hear it.

“…it’s almost through.”

Then he blinked, turned to me, and smiled. Like nothing happened.

The next morning, he didn’t remember anything. Or at least pretended not to. We smoked and watched some ancient aliens rerun like nothing happened.

But it got worse.

He started sketching things — fast, angry scribbles on the back of junk mail. Always the same shape: three triangles overlapping, forming a sort of jagged spiral in the center. I asked him what it was.

“Interface mark,” he said. “For the transmission.”

He wouldn’t say more than that.

Then, two nights ago, I woke up at exactly 3:17 a.m. again. The air felt heavy, like the whole house was holding its breath. I came out of my room, and there he was again — in the exact same position, standing in the dark.

This time, he spoke before I said anything.

“Don’t interrupt it.”

His voice sounded… layered. Like it was coming from behind his own voice, delayed by a second. Like he was translating something in real time.

Then — and I swear on my life — he lifted his shirt, slowly, and burned into the skin of his chest was that same triangle symbol. Not drawn. Not tattooed. Burned. Still red and raw, like it had been pressed into him.

I asked him what the hell that was.

He said:

“You have to make space. For what’s coming through.”

And then he collapsed. No sound. Just dropped like a marionette with the strings cut.

I called 911, but halfway through dialing, the lights flickered and every clock in the house jumped to 3:17 a.m. again. My phone shut off. I was shaking too hard to even move. Just staring at him on the floor, breathing like he was dreaming with his eyes wide open.

He’s awake now. Acting normal again. Like none of it happened. He’s sitting in the kitchen right now eating toast and talking about how the Rothschilds engineered music to dull our instincts. Like the last two days didn’t exist.

But the symbol on his chest is still there.

And last night I heard him whispering in his room.

He was alone.

But I heard two voices.
