“You won’t make the subway,” says Kelly.

Sure I will. I’ve done this before.

And drunker than this, thank you very much.

What does she know anyway, she’s from Mississauga.

God, I’m part of the reason people hate Toronto, aren’t I?

I’m taking the steps two at a time, even though my brother sprained his ankle this exact way, and he wasn’t wearing pumps.

I never stay out this late, but spring gets me every year. Feels like something might happen after a long, slushy winter, criss-crossing the DVP five days a week. I might be the only dumbass who pays top dollar to live right on Pape at Danforth, only to work outside the city.

So it’s nice, nights like this, once in awhile with Kelly. One too many vodka sodas, one too few BFF chats where we validate the shit out of each other on a curb outside a shawarma place. Howling at the moon... or at least the condo scaffolding blocking the moon.

It’s good to come up for a gulp of air. Believe for a minute that we’ll figure it all out one day. That everything will be fine.

I hear the tinny squeal of brakes as the train pulls into the station below. One more flight of stairs to go, but Ossington isn’t that deep.

I’ll make it.

I better, or it’s the Blue Line bus, cue horrified shudder. It’s impossible to get a seat on that rolling shitshow, and I’m headed far enough east that my plantar fasciitis has a say.

Not to mention it’s a long time to avoid eye contact with muttering weirdos and their roaming, hopeful eyes while undergrads complain about how hopeless dating has become. Sorry, kids, it doesn’t get better.

I fling myself across the platform as the chimes cycle down from perfect fifth, to major third, to root. The doors try to take a bite out of my purse, but I make it.

I check out the subway car, nervous. Normally I would watch the train as it pulled in and change cars if I saw someone sketchy inside. I mean, it is almost 2 am.

This is when the bad stuff happens.

I dab sweat from under my glasses and grin at a welcome discovery: I have the car all to myself. Oh HELL yes. Miracle of miracles on the TTC, praise be to the holy ghost of Joseph Bloor.

I tuck myself into a seat at the far corner and fatigue drops down like a quilt. I soak up the emptiness of the train car for a few seconds, then my phone has me.

The train slows at Christie and I silently will the platform to be empty. I know my luck won’t hold forever, but the magic of the subway to yourself is something to hope for.

We pull into the station and, hallelujah, it’s deserted. The doors open. Chime to close.

And suddenly he’s there.

Hurtling down the stairs.

Rushing the doors.

They almost close him out, but he manages to get an arm in and levers them open.

He’s tall and burly, a threadbare hoodie obscuring his face. Caucasian. Bad posture. Sweaty.

He coughs without covering his mouth, then drops heavily into a seat at the far end of the car.

He takes rapid, shallow breaths, his head bowed.

I don’t think he’s noticed me.

I slump lower in my seat as we pull away.

He picks at something on the back of his hand.

I shouldn’t stare, but—

Shit. Oh shit.

He twitches and looks directly at me, as if sensing my gaze.

I avoid eye contact and study my lap, standard procedure for a woman with the misfortune of drawing a man’s attention at night.

He’s still staring.

I can feel it.

I sneak a look, and he’s mouthing something to me, beckoning with his hand.

I shake my head, no.

He’s getting to his feet.

Coming over.

I glance up at the emergency yellow strip. What is the criteria, exactly, for that five hundred dollar misuse fine? Would they knock a few bucks off if I was wrong, but they saw this guy and put themselves in my shoes? Funny that in my perfect world it’s not even a possibility that men don’t attack women. Just that men get less upset when women are scared of them.

He sits down across from me, elbows on his knees, leaning forward.

“I said it’s so late,” he says.

I nod.

He clears his throat with an elastic gurgle, swallowing the result.

“You shouldn’t be here this late. It’s not safe.”

“It’s okay,” I say. “My boyfriend is waiting up for me.”

He doesn’t react to the hint.

“Some bad stuff goes on in these tunnels,” he continues, as if I never spoke.

“You’re right,” I say. They like it when you tell them they’re right.

“No, you don’t get it,” he says. He gnaws on his thumbnail like a rabbit, then sucks the quick when he draws blood.

My thoughts return to the yellow strip, but what’s that going to do, other than piss him off? It’s not like a constable’s hiding behind a seat, waiting to pop out.

So it’s plan B, the pepper spray in my purse. Which may or may not be expired. I think about the best way to do this. He’s pretty close. Could I get the safety off in time if he lunged? Does it even have a safety? It’s got to, they all have safeties.

He’s picking at a scab on his face now. The dead skin peels away, but it doesn’t bleed underneath. Just a shiny dime-sized dot where the puss is starting to gather.

“You don’t know what they’re doing down here,” he says.

My hand is inside the purse now, searching by feel.

“They get us alone,” he says. “Subway late at night is perfect.”

My fingers identify the cold cylinder of the pepper spray.

“Who is they?” I ask.

“Not who, what,” he says.

 “I don’t understand.”

The man sighs, as if gathering his faculties. Then it all comes out in a whoosh:

“My buddy Kevin heard about them like ten years ago, was some shit in New York, you know how they have rats.”

“Sure.”

“And I think when they came, or maybe they didn’t come, maybe they were always here?”

“The rats?”

He thumps his fist against the glass window in frustration and I clutch the pepper spray tighter.

“No, god damn it, them. They were in New York, and they took over the rats, and they’re coming to get us now.”

He just stares at me, waiting for a response.

“Right, I heard about that,” I say, offering my most maximum placating tone. “The rats biting people in New York.”

“No, no no no,” he hisses, leaning in too close and glancing around like someone will hear us. “They use the rats to move around. It’s us they want.”

He opens his mouth and taps his tongue with two fingers. “They get in here. They burrow in and they ride us like we ride this train. You get it?

“I’m not sure I--”

“And if you look close, you can tell who they got already. They smile all the time. They talk sweet, like a mom to a kid. They tell you everything’s okay, everything’s fine.”

He shakes his head, his knee bouncing.

“But it’s not fine.”

He puts his head in his hands. For a moment he looks like a little boy, devastated that his father forgot to pick him up from school.

“Nobody believes me,” he mutters into his palms.

I relax my grip on the pepper spray. Poor guy’s probably schizophrenic. And here I am about to assault him.

The train starts to slow. Whether or not he deserves my pity, it’s time to get off at the next stop and spring for an Uber.

 I get to my feet.

“That’s really weird, thanks for telling me—“

He grabs my wrist.

“You can’t go out there right now. They’ll get you alone.”

I try to pull away but his cold fingers are strong and he’s got a good grip.

Squeezing tighter now.

God, he could crush my wrist if he wanted.

I try the voice they taught me in self defence class. Loud. Business.

“Let GO. NOW.”

“I’m trying to help you, stupid,” he growls, pulling me toward him.

The free hand digs in my purse.

Safety switch, click, and it’s out, and I’m hosing the creep down.

The liquid sprays out thick like silly string, orange and fizzy. I nail him right between the eyes and blink back tears as the mist irritates mine.

He lets go of my wrist and howls, clutching at his face.

“You bitch,” he moans. “Oh, you bitch.”

I hurry to the door, ready to make a break for it as we slow toward the station.

I look back.

He’s still doubled over.

I’ll make it.

Then the lights go out.

The train rolls to a heavy stop, somewhere in the tunnel.

For a moment, all is darkness. His soft, blubbery curses echo in the still of the subway car.

“How could you do that,” says his voice from the void.

The emergency lights come on. It’s faint, but I can see him hunched over, pressing his face to a seat, dragging it across the maroon fabric of the backrest.

The PA system startles me. “Attention TTC customers, there is a problem at track level. We are asking that you make your way to the front of the train.”

I head for the sliding door to the next car, but he’s on his feet, ruddy-faced and squinting. It’s hard to ignore how big he is, a human wall between me and safety.

He takes a step forward, but stops as I brandish the pepper spray like a talisman.

 “You don’t get it,” he says, tears streaming down his face. “This is them. This is how they do it. They cut the power. They take the driver. And he lures the rest of us. You heard him, he said ‘everything is fine.’ That’s what they say.”

I shake my head. “He didn’t say that.”

This gives the man pause. Then he says, “Maybe they didn’t get him yet.”

I sigh. “Look, I appreciate that you are scared. So am I. But—“

He lunges forward, knocking the spray out of my hand.

Pulls me into a bear hug.

I manage to stomp on his foot with my heel, but he just grunts, pinning my arms. He smells like sauerkraut that’s been in the sun.

He manhandles me into a seat and holds me there, his face pressed between my shoulders.

“I couldn’t save Kevin,” he blubbers. “He would talk about them, what they were doing down here. Said the government was in on it. They get everyone, one by one.”

“I can talk to you if you let go of me,” I say. And he does. He even backs away a seat to give me some space. 

God, I hate that I feel even a little bit sorry for this broken man.

“Kevin died?” I ask softly.

“No, he’s still around. He’s just... not Kevin anymore. Went to rehab, got a place uptown, he’s got a fuckin’ nine to five, they got him.”

“It sounds like he just got clean,” I say. “He sounds fine.”

“That’s what he always says. Everything’s fine. But it’s not. He can’t see things anymore.”

“Maybe you just don’t see the same things. People change.”

He stares at the floor for a beat, then rises to his feet.

“You still don’t get it. But that’s okay. I’ll protect you. I’ll see if they got the driver. You stay here where it’s safe.”

He continues staring at me for a moment, then puts up his hood and rips wide the door between cars. As the door clatters shut behind him, I shudder with relief. My hands are shaking from adrenaline.

I retrieve my pepper spray and take a couple of tentative steps toward the door, watching him make his way across the next car.

Past that, the glass is too dim.

I test the door at the other side of the car and find that leads into the blackness of the tunnel. I am weighing whether to try my luck out there or wait for TTC constables to arrest him and find me when I hear it.

A thump, then two more.

Then a shout.

No, not a shout.

A scream. I recognize the man’s voice.

Good. They’ll get him the help he needs.

I hear footsteps, coming back.

The door opens.

It’s him.

He has a knife in his right hand, the tip pointed down.

The blade is wet.

Both of his hands are slick and dark.

His smile is lazy and wide, like he’s waking from a beautiful dream.

“Hey,” he says. “It’s all good up there.”

He takes another step toward me and I spray him again. He blinks away the liquid like it came from a water gun. The serene smile doesn’t falter for a second.

“STOP!” I say, gesturing at the knife. “What the fuck did you do?”

He looks down at his hands as if they belong to someone else, then relaxes his fingers.

The knife clacks against the floor and bounces toward my feet.

It seems like his smile is going to break apart his whole face. Between his lips, yellow teeth, like amber pebbles.

“Everything’s fine,” he says.

I crouch and grab the knife, gripping the sticky handle. Behind me, my groping hands slide the door open.

I glance back and see movement on the tracks. Something scrabbles at the edge of darkness.

The size of a rat.

In that liminal space, neither inside nor outside the car, I pause.

Something is moving behind the guy, eclipsed by his broad shoulders.

I see an orange vest.

Hard hat.

A TTC employee.

Oh, thank God.

He peeks out from behind the man and waves at me, cheerfully, a big smile on his face.

“Miss, please come to the front of the train,” he says, as he steps out from behind the man in the hoodie.

He absentmindedly clutches a wide gash in his stomach. Blood pulses from between his fingers. He moves as if the wound doesn’t exist.

O, his smile is wide and pastoral.

I jump down to the tracks.

Land badly, but I can still run.

I’ll make it.

\*\*\*

I told the police what I saw, but I can see now that they’re compromised.

So I’ll tell people myself.

How the two men reached for me, their faces radiating warmth.

“There’s nothing to worry about,” said one.

“Everything is fine,” said the other.

 “It’s not fine!” I shout at a woman across from me in the subway car. She reaches into her purse as a child burrows into her coat.

“It’s not fine!” I say, louder.

But who would believe it?
