So I figured I should start out by saying that I’ve never written any of my story’s down before now, and I have quite a few. 

I’m in the army (can’t say which base specifically for obvious reasons) but I can say that my travels have brought me everywhere from Germany to Missouri. The army loves abbreviations so I’ll explain what each one means when I use an acronym. My first story takes place in Missouri and it still leaves me full of questions even now. 

I was on the last FTX (field training exercise) of OSUT (one station unit training) and we dug our foxholes immediately after establishing our patrol base (for lack of a better term our campsite). This particular FTX was 5 days long for reference. We were doing stand two (everyone on lookout for the last 30 minutes of daylight) at the end of our first day. I was in my foxhole and I heard movement about 20 yards out from my position so I whispered to the guy next to me (I’ll be referring to him as D for this story). 

“Aye D, I’m hearing something a little ways out to our 2” (2 being the direction, think of a clock)

“Yeah, I hear it. Might be Senior M (our platoon senior drill sergeant), just get ready for shit to kick off” 
“Bet, is your 249 racked?” (The 249 is the SAW)

I already knew the answer to my question but I still felt the need to ask, just to fill the air with the familiar sound of my own voice. 

“Yep, keep listening and see if you can find him”

So I laid there motionless trying to find the man that had made our last 19 weeks pure hell. Now I grew up in West Virginia hunting and spending my first 18 years in the woods, but I for the life of me could not find the source of the snapping twigs and rustling leaves. 

The sound seemed to be moving closer to us and getting more aggressive, almost violent. Then it stopped, all at once there was just silence, no birds or frogs. I mean absolute silence, which was very odd. 

Then it started again but it sounded like multiple people running through the woods, almost sprinting at us. D let off a burst with the 249 and called out contact. But as soon as the shots rang out it was silent again. At that moment Senior M came running up behind us and started cursing at us for having an ND (negligent discharge). D and myself were confused but didn’t question him, we learned very early that you never questioned any of the cadre. 

After explaining our situation to senior M he shook his head and walked out in front of our position and looked around with his flashlight and couldn’t find anything. 

Later that night I kept hearing scratching and grinding noises from the direction of the rustling from earlier. These noises would last for about 3 minutes and then it would go back to that eerie silence only for the noises to start back up about half an hour later. I didn’t sleep that night. 

The next morning after a lovely breakfast of MREs we had time to further fortify our fighting positions. I took the opportunity to look where the rustling had come from the evening prior. I found something that still weirds me out today. 

In a clearing not even 25 yards in front of our foxholes was another foxhole facing ours. To make it even worse there was a fresh deer carcass laying in it. It looked like the antlers had been brutally ripped off and it throat crudely slashed open. After seeing this we told our cadre but when we led them back to where I had found the deer the hole had been filled in a small mound of dirt. Myself and D were persistent on what we had seen but the cadre wrote it off as us trying to go back to the comfort of our beds back in our bay. 

Everything was calm the next 3 nights, until the final night after we did our culminating event which consisted of our platoon attacking a small town which was occupied by the cadre and the other 2 platoons. After our culminating event we fired off the remainder of our blanks and pulled security on the patrol base (similar to stand two but in the early afternoon and we only had 50% of our people in their fighting positions) I was laying in my foxhole on my back with my rifle propped up against the dirt mound by my head. D was talking about his girlfriend back in NYC and then he go really quiet. 

I asked why he stopped talking, to which he gave no response. Then looked over the dirt mound in the direction of the clearing and saw him. It was roughly 1730, right before we were supposed to start stand two that evening. In the twisted shadows cast by the trees, standing in the middle of the clearing was a man with no head. He was wearing a very old US army uniform, he was carrying his helmet in one hand and a Kbar knife in the other. He was watching us, I sat there unable to move. 

Then he turned and ran deeper into the woods,  at a full sprint. After the longest 5 minutes of my life I finally looked over at D, who was still laying with his 249 pointed towards the clearing. I finally broke the silence. 

“Did you see that shit?”

“Yup.” 

After asking a couple more questions about how long he’d been there we decided we couldn’t tell the Cadre about it. They’d think we were crazy and send us to camp Charlie (Psyche ward) and have us separated from the army. 

So that’s what we did, we didn’t tell anyone until I got to my first real assignment in Germany. I had heard some of my friends telling stories about creepy shit they’ve seen. Then I told the story for the first time. No one even batted an eye at it, they just offered similar stories from their FTXs when they were in OSUT. 

I haven’t talked to D since we graduated. But it does provide some comfort that I’m not crazy. 

I’ll be posting more stories about things I’ve seen whenever I get the time. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
