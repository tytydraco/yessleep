We have been married for a month now. She is already in her last trimester. But, we don’t sleep together, i.e. not the same bed. This usually happens years in the course of the marriage, yet I guess we are too soon. Maybe that caused all of these. Right now, I am posting this here to prove my innocence, maybe you all can testify for my innocence. Well, is that possible? Can a stranger witness for my innocence at the court?



I don’t really know what started this. I have some guesses here and there. First, and most important reason is she is jealous of many women taking interest in me. I am now  five years in banking business, and with my 7 years of experience in sales prior to this, I can say my people relations skill is quite good. I am the highest number of both investment slots sold and also friends, both inside and outside the company. Heck, I have private talks with my co-workers, my boss' wife and clients in their own homes for some important advice. The golden boy must give what he can give, all for the sake of my company and money. 



Second, maybe she got angry that her enrollment for college, right after her senior high school,  didn’t push through because of her pregnancy. I didn’t understand. This is the fruit of our love. Her father, my driver, couldn’t agree more. I remember his reaction: red cheeks and eyes, tight smile, tears and sweats, and the shaking of his hands - all showed his happiness when I told him that we were getting married. He should be, I am his boss and his future son-in-law at that time. His future slot in the home for the aged is secured, instead ended up in the streets. My man is so poor that he has no savings and insurance for himself. I really pity him.



Lastly, maybe she was grieving for the loss of our first child. I guess, women are like this, as my experience with my first and second ex-wives, that at the news of the first baby, they would vanish to wherever they think of.  It was hard but I managed to catch them. All the same happened to my wife now. After her father informed me about the news, I immediately went to her and of course with flowers and chocolates. She first acted hard to get and ran to another city, to her friend who was the captain of the college basketball team. He was a tall and muscular man, and hid my darling when I came to his apartment.  First, I pleaded and made many efforts to talk with him. But, he was hostile to me. I was afraid for her so men gotta do what men must do. I won’t tell you here. However, despite living with me for 3 months, and with my utmost love and care, the child was, you know, gone. She cried and cried. It was hard to stop her wailing and silence her. 



I know how hard it was for her, it was hard for me too, so a month later, she got pregnant again. It was really challenging to convince her, more challenging than convincing a client to buy my insurance investment.  And, this time, I made sure to watch her close. I gave her own room, complete with anything she needs like  a fancy marble bathtub in the toilet room inside her own room, and a kitchen with complete appliances and space for  cooking needs. You see, I don’t believe in this new trend of,  even though I can afford, having a mansion or tall complex building as a love nest for newlyweds. I want to be intimate, I want to see her every minute. 



So, why do we sleep separately now? Do not get confused, I sleep on a bed beside her bed. Not separate bedrooms. Just sleep on a separate bed.  



In fact, on the night of our honeymoon, I obviously slept beside her. After the wedding, she just laid immediately to the bed without removing her wedding dress and makeup. I thought she wanted me to be the one to undress her, I thought it was sexy. But, when I began removing the ribbons, she hissed and shouted at me and clawed my forearms. But, I did everything to calm her down. Because, I am a good and patient husband after all. 



The next morning I cooked her breakfast, bathed her, gave her her prescription vitamins, applied alcohol on the indents in her wrists and ankles, combed her hair, made her a coffee - all lovely things I could do as a loving husband before leaving for work.



The following three nights, she was receptive to me because she didn’t kick me or claw me when I lay beside her. But after the latest visit of her father, she returned to physically hurting me again. I really don’t know what her father’s poisonous tongue fed on my wife’s innocent ears. 



I and her father had a solemn talk, and I informed her that he won’t visit her again. Obviously, after what I did to him. Don’t ask. My lower back was aching from shoveling the clay soil. 



But, this made my wife fiercer than previous. Even just touching her made her jolt and began attacking me. She even stopped eating her food. She must be really upset with her father. Poor wife.



So, I told the CEO of my company, my younger brother, that I will work at home for an indefinite period of time to cater the needs of my wife. It was so hard to assist her eating, take her to bath, clean her because she refused to leave bed so she soiled her clothes. She didn’t talk to me.I missed her sweet voice. Yet, I did everything. But, a husband is a superman eh? I must endure this for my wife and my child. 



The hardest part was that, as soon as I started working at home,  she wouldn't allow me to sleep beside her. Every time I was near the bed, she would protest so hard, she would shout and hissed. Poor wife, is this what they call Prenatal Depression?



But something bizarre happened last night. Around 1:13 AM, she stood up, caressed my hair a little bit, and walked toward the kitchen. I remembered sighing in relief because I thought she would cook breakfast for me. I closed my eyes and was pretty sure I snoozed back. Suddenly, and neither am I kidding nor diagnosed with mental disorder, I felt a quick thrusting force on my left chest followed by sharp pain. I opened my eyes and there on top of me was a ghost! A monster! Its face was covered by dark chaotic hair, bloodshot eyes, it had thin arms and bony bare chest but its stout in the lower torso. I looked down and saw she was holding a knife pierced on the chest. I swear. Oh, I really swear. It was a legit monster! It pulled back and stabbed me three times before I managed to push its shoulder to have distance between us and kicked her off the bed. I rushed toward the door to open it. Curse those five bolts and three door knobs, it gave me a hard time to open the door. 



I shouted for my wife to escape through the door. I can’t see well in the dark, so it would be hard to run through the forest in the dark of the night. Also, I need to draw the monster's attention. So I hid on the toilet, where I am still here now. I am bleeding. The emergency is on the way. 



Thank you for reading. Please help me. I rest my case to you guys. I need help.



 I should’ve calculated this attack, what a blunder. I think this is the result of many stressful days and nights taking care of my wife. I hope my wife managed to escape. If only I was careful. If only my wife had allowed me to sleep with her.
