**Part 1: Rebirth**

By [Ringo Cross](https://www.reddit.com/r/RingocrossStories/s/u7AX3tG12Q)

*“Be careful whose soul you steal. You may never be able to forget their screams. Terrance... Your time isn’t over... I bind your soul to my light. I am your Savior... Here... drink my blood... Consume my flesh... Allow my undying sacrament to be your guiding force.”*

\* \* \* \*

His voice jolted me back into the pits of reality and darkness. Just when I had finally forgotten my despair! Just when all the light had finally gone away! Curse the fool who had called upon my shiftless spirit!

My eyes shot open. I gasped for breath, but none came to me. I-I couldn’t breathe! Panic overloaded my fractured mind. Every inch of my flesh afire. The pain... I could feel it in my bones. It was like my soul had been pulled away from the lake of fire, midscream. My unholy torment left me paralyzed in fear and anguish.

Wait. I remember now. I was... I was here! Down here, on this cold, wet basement floor! That’s right—they did this! They took everything away from me!

“*Cursed!* How did I? ... W-Who’s responsible for bringing me back?!”

That’s when I saw his boot next to my head. I slowly gazed up and stared directly into the lifeless eyes of the one who had brought me back.

No... He definitely wasn’t one of those who was responsible for my death. He was a different monster altogether. I wish I could say I owed him a debt of gratitude, but his *gift* turned out to be a curse.

“I thought I was—"

“Dead?” he asked.

“Yeah, I thought it was over?”

“Death can be too forgiving.”

Blood gushed from my mouth when I tried to speak again. It was odd... it was as if my body was trying to expel whatever was left of my essence.

“How is this possible?”

“All is possible through me.”

“Who the hell are you?”

He crouched down and began to examine me with those soulless eyes of his. Satisfied by whatever it was he was searching for, he spoke: “You were dead, but *I* resurrected you. I brought you back as one of my children.”

His appearance startled me. I swear. He couldn’t have been any older than seventeen. And his movements, they were human in nature, but very strange. So mystical in fact, there was nothing I could compare them to. He moved and swayed with a grace that was divine.

His purple and black robe concealed his physical features. Glyphs and symbols of all nature seemed to be weaved into the fabric. Some glowed, others flittered, and even stranger, a few of them whispered to my subconscious. I felt dizzy just gazing at them.

His voice was deep and dazzling. It didn’t match his youthful appearance at all. His hair was white and stark as the snowy weather that dotted my blighted city. For some reason, I found myself drawn to him.

He looked down upon me with such intrigue and pity, as if he knew my pain. His smirk was uncanny. It was like he could read my thoughts. He stood back up and placed his hands inside of the loose-fitting garment, dawning the thing more like a cape than an actual robe.

“You remember? Good. The more you embrace the pain the stronger you’ll be because of it.”

“W-Who are you?”

“I am your Creator.”

“What does that mean?”

“You are the fourth I have chosen.”

“What the hell did you do to me?!”

“Humph. You are a revenant. And you will forever be one of my children. You see, I was the first of our kind. I am the strongest. Do not take my gift lightly.”

“How? Wh-Why? What do I do?!”

“By drinking from my cup and feeding upon the bread, you have partaken in undead communion. There is no return. You have transcended, my child. You stand between the bounds of living and unliving.”

I staggered to my feet only to fall on my face. My legs were weak and numb more than any other part of my body. It was strange. My very existence, it just didn’t feel right. It felt like I was trapped inside of a shell that no longer belonged to me.

I was completely numb. Taste, touch, smell... all the senses I had taken for granted were gone. I rolled over on my back and grimaced in anger. Pain was the only thing that reminded me I still existed. It flowed through me like the blood that once flowed through my veins.

“Seek revenge on those who have wronged you. For only through the blood of sinners, will find the answers you seek. Do not disappoint me, my child.”

I watched as the being before me faded, as if he were an apparition. I knew trauma could do terrible things, like play tricks on the mind. So, it was difficult to know if what I was experiencing was real, or some sick expression of a dying man’s imagination.

Memories never died if they hurt enough. They might hide somewhere deep in the recesses of the mind, but they were there, waiting to be seized. I closed my eyes and seized the chain that was wrapped around my neck. It was another painful reminder of what had happened.

They beat me, tortured me, twisted my mind with their foul threats of execution. The bastards left me here to wilt on this damp basement floor like a mongrel. I could hear laughter and banter coming from upstairs. It was as if my existence meant nothing... This was unforgivable! In a sudden moment of grief and disbelief, I gritted my teeth and asked God why this had happened to me.

I used the bitterness to fuel me. I inched my way towards the staircase. My arms shook from the exertion, but I could care less. I was going to make those bastards pay. All I could think about was my wife and daughter. I tried to cry, but I couldn’t. This... this *curse* had taken my tears as well as my humanity.

My torture had lasted the whole day and night. They wanted to know the name of my supplier. I-I couldn’t tell them. I wouldn’t break. It was a hopeless plight without any light. I-I was doomed to an ill fate from the start. I *had* to take my secret to the grave. I-I couldn’t risk the cartel finding out that I had told without permission. I knew how they operated. Better for me to die at the hands of a few gangsters than jeopardize the lives of those closest to me by snitching.

Touching that first step with my fingertips snapped me out of my chain of depressive thoughts. Getting this far was somewhat of an accomplishment. I pressed on, but before I could seize another step, I was again reminded of my ordeal by the chain around my neck. The cold iron stopped me in my tracks. I grimaced at the thought. Here I was, chained to this dirty floor like a dog. How degrading and twisted were the possibilities.

This emblem of my suffering only added fuel to the pyre of rage that consumed me. I grabbed the chain with both hands and broke it. I was surprised by my sudden surge of strength. *Good. I’ll need it, if I plan on breaking the bastards who did this, I thought.*

I dragged myself up each step and around the bend in the stairwell. When I slithered my way into the kitchen, a man standing by the stove, cooking dope, saw me and began to yelp. His harsh shrills caused the three men sitting at the table to look over in my direction.

They were sitting there smoking cigarettes, listening to gangster music, and playing cards. My untimely entrance caused quite a bit of confusion and fascination. They all stood from the table and paused for a minute, taking a bit of time to take stock of the situation.

I recognized the ringleader almost immediately. His alias was “Big Ed.” He was a tough guy who wouldn’t run or panic in a fight. We had done business together on quite a few occasions. I used him mainly as muscle, whenever I had to meet up with my supplier.

Big Ed let out a riotous laugh when he saw my pitiful state. His laughter was infectious. It caused the two ruffians with him to chuckle at my expense. He shook his head and told one of them, “I thought you took out the trash?” referring to me, of course.

“Aw. Damn. My fault, boss. I thought he was dead! I figured I could get rid of him later.”

“Dumbass,” Big Ed sneered. “Eh. I guess I should’ve just taken out the trash myself. Look at him. You didn’t even make sure he was finished! I’m calling the boss man and telling him how much of a lazy piece of crap you are—as soon as I get through dumping his body.”

“Tch. Come on, Ed! Don’t do that! You know how greedy Martel is. He’ll make me work for free. I’m trying to get those new slides that just came out.”

“Shut up. You need to work a day or two for free. You’re lucky I know your auntie. I’d slap the piss out of you if I didn’t. Where’s the trash bags?”

“In the yard. How many do we need?”

“Eh. The usual, bout six or seven.”

“Alright. Roger that, boss.”

“Hold on. Let me show you how you’re supposed to finish the job when I tell you to put somebody out of their freaking misery,” Big Ed sneered.

He gave the ruffian an irritated look as he walked over and kicked me in the head. It wasn’t a hard blow. It was more in the way you’d kick a wounded dog to see how close it was to death. With a boisterous chuckle, he asked me if I was thirsty.

“Y-Yes...” I uttered.

“You want some water?”

*“P-P-Please!”*

“Too bad, you ugly bugger!”

“He looks dead,” one of the goons chuckled.

“What happened to him?” the other one asked.

“Hell, we beat the brakes off of him last night—*that’s* what happened to his punk ass,” Big Ed laughed as he gave me another dehumanizing kick to the head.

“I don’t know fellas. I got a bad feeling about this one. Just be careful,” the cooked chimed in.

“Shut up, scaredy-cat,” Big Ed said with a smirk. He looked over at him and threw in, “A patsy like you probably doesn’t even know how to fire a pistol.”

Too much... It was all just too much to take... I-I closed my eyes and begged for death. *My wife, Terresa! My daughter,* *Jessica!* My life wasn’t mine anymore. It was a cruel role forced upon me by another.

I could hear them mocking my cries as I called out to my wife and to God. Even the cook, who had shown me a modicum of sympathy, partook in the mockery.

*“Why do you hesitate? Slay your tormentors... They cannot be saved. For they are wicked, and wickedness can only be cured by one thing... Fret not over mortal sin. Your soul is no longer bound by mortality.”*

Not only did I hear my creator’s voice, but I could see him standing right in front of me. The vision was clear as day. His words stirred something inside me. A fire ignited in the space that was once my heart. His anger was now my anger... And my pain was now his to keep.

I grimaced wildly while stumbling to my feet. Big Ed took a step back and looked over at the others in surprise. My condition wasn’t funny anymore. Their joy and amusement had given way to fear and bemusement.

I could see it in their eyes. Everyone except Big Ed was ready to flee. He was the only thing holding them back. I shuffled towards them. Every step peeled away the shadows and revealed a bit more of my ghastly face. The tone of their conversation turned desperate and chaotic:

“W-What is he?”

“He’s dead! How is he—"

“Shut up!” Big Ed shouted.

*“Ah! Ahhhhh! No!!!”*

I lunged at the goon to his right. It was awful... I unleashed pure hatred upon his wretched flesh and sinful soul. Inaction was their first reaction to his ear-piercing shrieks. They watched in silence and trepidation as I tore him apart.

His screams were music to my ears. A delicate *symphony of pain* only I understood. Every strike removed chunks of flesh and bone. Where was the laughter? Where had the joy reaped from my sorrow gone? It was quiet enough to hear a church organ as I feasted upon his organs.

“Shoot him, dammit!” Big Ed shouted.

I rose to my feet and took a moment to listen to the sorrow that escaped from the ruffian I had shredded. His feeble whimpers were followed by blood gurgles. His mangled body gave in to suffering and began its final death throes. *Oh,* I relished his anguish. It was only a glimpse into the nightmare they had inflected upon me.

I glared at the survivors while wiping the blood that ran from my mouth. None of them could fully process what they had just witnessed. It took some time, but this sorry excuse for a gangster finally pulled his weapon like his boss, Big Ed, had been demanding ever since I unleashed my rage upon their fellow comrade in arms.

He aimed for my head. His hand shook violently as he tried his damndest to hold back the tide of reluctance. I could see it in his eyes. He was ready to flee not fight:

“S-Stay back!” he cried out.

“What the hell?! Shoot the rotten bastard!” Big Ed shouted. He cursed himself for forgetting to grab his own weapon. He had left it sitting, right there, on the table. If he wanted it, he would have to go through me.

“His eye! It’s... it’s glowing! Oh God, man! He’s a demon!” the goon cried and hollered.

*“Shoot the ugly bastard! Now!”* Big Ed hollered.

He fired a single shot. The thunderous noise caught me and everyone else off guard. The impact of the bullet smashing into my skull caused me to stagger.

He had shot me on the left side of the face. I examined the wound with my fingers. There was... there was no blood? I could feel nothing. Not even as my body pushed the bullet from my brain and fractured temporal bone. The crumpled metal fell to the floor. It all happened so fast. Next thing I know, the skin and bones on my face had begun to heal all on its own. I checked with my fingers again, just to be sure, but failed to find even a single scratch or groove that didn’t belong.

I glared directly into the eyes of my assailant. It was like time stood still. I could hear his heart racing as it palpitated. I could see his legs trembling. Terror had become his newfound friend.

I struck like lightning, degloving his hand holding the gun at the wrist. The sound of flesh peeling from skin was sloshy and guttural. It reminded me of the noise you’d hear while fleshing a deer hide.

The gun fell to the floor. He grabbed his hand, which was nothing more than a bloody pulp, and gazed upon me in utter shock and dismay. His eyes, they held a helplessness that matched the desperation in his fearful plea. He begged for his life. He claimed anything and everything under the sun, all in a vain effort to get me to stop.

This *desire* for blood. It was as swift as it was irresistible. I gave in to its call and pounced on my prey, transforming his pleas into cries of agony. I could feel his vocal cords vibrate under the crushing weight of my fangs. I stole from him, what they had tried to steal from me. The taste of his suffering was sweet.

I drained his blood until I was fully satiated. Then I released my hold on what was once a living, breathing man. His body flopped to the floor. I exhaled in ecstasy. Blood was the only thing I cared for. It was the only thing I could taste. It made me feel alive again!

I smirked wickedly when Big Ed tried to make a run for it. He stumbled to the floor and began slithering and scampering about like an insect. I grabbed him by the neck and lifted him off his feet. He placed his hands over mine and gasped. He tried to speak, but his utterance was too garbled and disturbed for me to grasp.

Staring into his eyes reminded me of the one thing that used to matter most: my wife and child. Because of his recklessness and greed, my family would never be whole. I eased my grip on his neck just enough to let this filthy rat screech and scrape out a few words.

“Who ordered the hit? Speak anything but the truth, and I’ll end your miserable existence.”

*“Please... l-let me go!”*

“Fine.”

When I released my hold, he fell to the floor and buckled to his knees. He grabbed his throat and coughed and wheezed for dear life. He glared up at me, with a look of grief, before crying out the name “Martel!”

*“No! N-Not Martel!*”

“I swear it was him!”

“I told you no lies!”

“N-N-Nobody was supposed to know! I tried to talk him out of it! It—it was a money grab! We figured if we could get you to talk, we could cut you out of the exchange and buy straight from the cartel!”

“All of this was over money?”

“I know! We got greedy!”

“But why? I could have lowered my fee.”

“I know, I know! I tried to talk him out of it I swear! Come on, please! You know how he gets!”

“Eh. Is that so?”

“You were good money! There was no reason to do you dirty. I didn’t have a choice!”

The last part of his statement must’ve really hit home. He started sobbing and repeating, “Dammit, man, this is messed up! This is all messed up!”

I couldn’t believe my ears. I stood there for a moment, stunned by his claims. Martel was the last person I thought capable of backstabbing me. We grew up together. Everything between us seemed grand. In fact, our families had brought in the New Year together.

Who needed enemies with a friend as conniving and deceitful as Martel? I guess you never really know what someone’s truly capable of until they finally give in to their deepest darkest inclination.

I knew what had to be done, but before I could get to it, there was a more immediate loose end requiring my attention: Humph. I watched him, the once proud and mighty “Big Ed,” stagger before me like a child who had lost his mother. He sniveled and driveled out another sad apology. As if admitting to his crimes would somehow absolve him of his sins. When in truth, there would be no light. His death would not be quiet or peaceful. The last thing I was going to do was let his soul slip through my fingers with godspeed. No, not after what he did to me.

“Please! Terrance, man, please! Let me go and I swear you’ll never hear from me again! Please, man, come on, don’t do this! I’m begging you! Please!”

“Heh. So, you’ll disappear, hey?”

“Yes! I swear on everything, bro!”

“That’s odd. I remember begging you to do the same for me when you and your men had me chained to the floor like a dog. Do you remember what you said?”

“Bro, I’m sorry! It-It was—"

“And when you said what you said to me. When you made it clear that I was a dead man, I begged you, personally, as someone I know. I begged you to let me call them... to let me tell my family I love them.”

“Terrance! It wasn’t—"

I slashed him across the face before he could finish blathering out his next lie. My mind was in a dark place when I inflicted injury upon him. His screams were blood curdling. My middle finger caught his eye and tore it from the socket. The ease at which I swiped away flesh reminded me of peeling the skin from an orange.

I flicked his eyeball off my finger. The sound was dense and splashy as it fell to the floor. Bits of flesh and bone oozed down his cheek. The trauma caused him to gasp for breath and the color to drain from his face. His pain and panic were so intense, so visceral; I couldn’t help but notice the way he slowly gave in.

I could see the blood flowing through his veins and arteries. I could see his heart from inside his chest. It was pumping in overdrive in a desperate attempt to keep up with his body’s insatiable demand for blood. He placed his hands to his chest and looked up at me.

“Oh God! Oh God, man! I think I’m having a heart attack! Christ! Save me!”

“You need help?”

“Yes! Oh God!”

I grinned menacingly while offering my hand to this cruel murderer. “I’ll save you, just like you saved me, right?”

He reached for my hand with a shaky hand. He tried to speak, but I don’t know if it was fear or pain that held back the words.

The thought of vengeance was sweet. The darkness took hold and rebuked any hint of kindness I may have otherwise shown him. I smote him in the chest. The viciousness behind my punch shattered his ribcage. I pushed through his chest cavity, scowling wildly like a predator in the process. I did not stop my assault until I had a firm grip on his wretched heart. That’s it... *Yes...* I could feel it beating irregularly. The sensation was gnarly and ungodly. The more I squeezed the more he wheezed in discomfort.

He placed his bloody hands over my arm in a feeble attempt to stop me. He tried to speak. He tried to beg for mercy. His lips quivered as he let out a sad whimper. He was tough; I’ll give him that much. He fought and held on much longer than I thought imaginable.

I made him suffer for it. I made him feel that same hopelessness that was thrust upon me. Death could be slow and burdensome for those unwilling to accept its embrace. Every breath he stole, every ounce he fought, exacted more and more until he finally reached the threshold. This was the last thing I remember before dying. That point where pain and suffering overshadow light and hope.

I sank my fingers into heart muscle. The sudden surge of pain must have jolted his being back into consciousness. He let out a scream that was filled with agony. He cried out for the Lord and so I eased my grip.

His body completely gave out after several minutes of this torture. He collapsed into my arms. His final utterance did little to soothe my rage:

“T-T-Terrance... All you... All you had to do was give us a name. T-T-That’s it...”

“Go rot in Hell!” I snarled before squeezing his heart until I had a fistful of macerated meat. I brought his twitching, writhing excuse for a corpse down to the floor. Then I brought my boot down on his face.

The unsightly sound the heel of my boot made as it first cracked and then dug into skull and brain sounded like a watermelon being bashed by a hammer.

“All I had to do was give up a name, huh? When will the madness end?” I grumbled bitterly to myself.

If I would have given them a name, they probably would have killed me anyway. And if they didn’t, the Sinaloa Cartel would have sent a hit squad to butcher me and my family. I had been warned not to snitch.

I stomped on his face until there was nothing left to stomp on but the floor. That was the first time the revenant side had truly taken over. I looked down at the bloody mess and found myself shocked by my conduct.

“W-What have I done?” I asked myself before vowing to never again lose control. Speaking of control, I was going to show my creator that I wasn’t his puppet.

The sea of thought and dismay I was lost in was broken by a disturbance coming from the other side of the kitchen. I looked over and saw the cook sniveling in the corner. He pissed himself when I began making my way over to him. His demonstration of fear and cowardice proved the lengths some of us would go in order to survive.

“Please! Oh God! No!” he cried out.

“What’s your name, kid?”

“Derrick! Look—I-I have kids!”

He scrambled to retrieve his wallet from his back pocket. I crouched down, right in front of him, and began to examine the photos. He looked so young. It surprised me to see that he had children.

“They’re beautiful.”

“Th-Thank you.”

“How old are they?”

“Two and four,” he whimpered.

“Do you want to see them again?”

“Yes! I love my kids!” he wept.

“Heh. I’m sure you do.”

“Please let me live! Please!”

“I want you to deliver a message.”

“Anything! Just don’t kill me!”

“You know Martel, right?”

“Y-Yes, I work for him.”

“Good. Tell your boss, he’s next. He’ll know who I am. And soon, he’ll know my pain.”

**Chapter 2**

**Reprieve**

The city was a whole different place at night. It’s been a while since I saw some of the things I saw. It brought back memories of my time hustling on the corner when I was supposed to be in school learning.

It pained me to witness the effects my role in the streets had played upon my community. I had done nothing but contribute to the destruction of my city. I ignored the suffering of others in my pursuit of what I thought was happiness. So many wandered the streets, destitute and homeless. Addiction was a ravager who did not play favorites when it came to taking prisoners.

If only I could go back and change things. Perhaps a fate as bad as this was fitting for someone as bad as me? Perhaps I was merely reaping what I had sold for so long. There was so much pain out here to be had after twilight. My pain was merely an ornament compared to some of the misery I saw shambling through the streets.

A few of the more lucid wanderers saw me for what I was. But the vast majority didn’t even bat an eye at my condition. They were too busy trying to get a fix on the vice that had broken them.

The only difference between me and them was that my fix had a unique fuel. One that could only be quenched by the foul blood of my enemies.

It was odd, having no desire for things I once craved. Hunger and thirst were foreign to me. The thought was repulsive to my remaining senses.

It was unusually cold for spring. Not like I could feel it. I made the assessment after passing through an alleyway and seeing a group of undesirables all huddled around a trash bin, they had set alight.

The closer I came to my destination, the closer I was to that growing sea of pain. I couldn’t avoid it anymore. I had to see them, or I would drown under the weight of my own melancholy. The shadows were my friend as I slinked into the backyard of my own home...

There they were... sitting right in the living room; waiting for me to come home. My wife, Teressa, looked as charming as ever. My daughter, Momo, was as sweet as can be. The pain within my undead heart... The tears that would never flow from my eyes again. This vow that we shared... to remain so until death do us part...

Why, God? Why? What did I do to our family? I should have gotten out the game sooner. I knew this life of crime and fast money would lead to doom or an early tomb. And yet I persisted. I chose to make my wife a widow and leave my lovely daughter fatherless.

My gut told me to leave the game, but I foolishly hung around. That wasn’t even what hurt the most. What killed me was knowing how close I was to leaving it all behind. I had to be greedy. I just had to close that one last deal with Martel. How could I have known it would turn out like this? How could I have said no to a friend? It was supposed to be smooth and easy, like all the other deals.

I leaned against the willow tree and watched them. It was unusual for Momo to be up this late. She was just sitting there, quiet as a church mouse, watching cartoons, and sipping hot chocolate.

I knew the only reason she was up this late was because they were waiting for me to walk through the door. It’s funny, I also knew that whenever my wife made coffee, our daughter would ask for a cup. She would tell her ok before sneakily making her a cup of hot chocolate instead. Hah. It was an innocent trick that always put a big smile on our little girl’s face. I understood why she did it. But I also understood that she needed to stop. Momo was a smart cookie; she was going to catch on eventually.

My wife, who I always called Reese, she was pacing back and forth. I could hear her on the phone with my mother. The two arguing back and forth as to where I could be. Seeing her all “stirred up” like this, stirred up another bad memory for me. In my rush to leave that morning, I had forgotten to say goodbye.

After a long sigh, I told myself, “Great. As if I needed anything else to regret.”

As much as I wanted to walk through that patio door and be with them, I knew it wouldn’t be the right thing to do. I had to leave my old life behind. Seeing me like this would cause nothing but grief.

I turned and walked away from my home. The torture I endured that night was nothing compared to walking away from everything I loved. If I could turn my back on my family, I was capable of anything. The thought rattled me. I-I didn’t know myself anymore.

I walked the streets that night for what seemed like an eternity. The later the hour, the more desolate my travels. I stumbled upon a park and found myself sitting on a bench, daydreaming about pushing my daughter on the swings. I would never again get to take her to the park, or out for ice cream on a hot, midsummer day.

I don’t know what happened. I must’ve lost track of time. When I looked up, I could see that it was almost daybreak. The closer it came to dawn, the weaker my body felt. My skin simmered. My bones ached. Dread blossomed inside me. Something instinctively told me I ought to seek shelter before it was too late.

I dashed into the woods. The trees created a canopy, which shielded me from the sudden onslaught of sunlight. I sprinted as fast as I could. The speed at which I traveled surprised me. I probably covered several miles in a matter of minutes. If it wasn’t for the sun, I probably could’ve gone on like that indefinitely.

There it was. Sweet salvation. A blighted house, right next to an open field. It was partially burnt, and striped for scrap like many of the derelict buildings in my city. The neighborhood was bleak. The homes on the block were all either decrepit or leveled. A garden stood in one of the empty lots, closest to the avenue. Its flowers were a testament to faith and new beginnings.

There was a bit of irony to my fate. I had done nothing but contribute to the plight of those who had sown the garden. I justified my drug dealing by blaming others. It took losing everything for me to realize the weight that my crimes carried with them.

I found a window with a loose board to climb through. I had made it to shelter just in time. Any longer and it would have been over for me. The realization was a bitter one. *This* was my new life... hiding like a thief in the light. I was a seed of misfortune that bloomed in a black garden. I struggled with this thought while drifting away into chaotic slumber.

A strange thing happened that morning. I had this dream... no... It, it felt too real to be a dream. It was like I was there. I could see the wind pressing against my overcoat. I was surrounded by trees that were devoid and withering amidst the shadowy undergrowth.

An old cathedral stood on the outskirts of an abandoned village. A faint but oddly familiar voice called out to me. The closer I came to the church, the clearer the words that were intoned.

The land seemed foreign and faraway. Based on the cathedral’s façade, if I had to guess, I’d say the architecture was European. The building had long since been abandoned. The entire right corner had caved in, leaving a massive pile of rubble on the floor of the south tower and aisle.

I stopped dead in my tracks almost as soon as I entered. I gazed around at all the decaying artwork and crumbling masonry. There was a faded fresco on the south wall, which depicted the end times.

What caught my eye was the image of these feral-like creatures. It was odd. They looked like they were human once. Something dark, something apocalyptic had stolen their humanity. They were all wretched, enslaved, and trapped in an abyss. They screamed, scraped, and reached out towards the fading light from the heavens.

The earth had been consumed by fire. What was once fertile, agile land was now barren and scorched by war and famine. I couldn’t really see anything else thanks to the rubble. Even if I could, the painting was severely tarnished. The hole in the ceiling had allowed much of it to rot and peel away from exposure.

Most of the stained glass panels were shattered. The few that remained depicted images of a boy, remarkably similar to my creator, performing miracles and feats of power that seemed impossible. It was... It was difficult to know for sure, but it appeared to me that the boy had suffered and died, before being resurrected. Who or what resurrected him? Who killed him in the first place? All worthy questions. Sadly, there weren’t enough panels left to decipher such bothersome things.

Suddenly, quietly, almost menacingly, the voice, *his* voice, snapped me out of my explorative daze. I looked over at the altar and saw him standing there.

He raised his arms and spoke: “Good. You are stronger. Come. Stand before my altar, my child.”

“Who are you?”

“I am your Creator.”

“Do you have a name?”

“I have a few names.”

“Eh. What is it that you want? Why am I here? Why did you turn me into this thing?”

“You are not a thing. You are a revenant. The fourth I have blessed with divine sustenance. The Lord may be the giver of life. But I am the giver of strife. Do not take what has been given to you with a trifle hand.”

I slowly made my way up the nave. Each step into the candlelight gave me a better glimpse at his face. It’s true, I was angry at him for what he did. But on the other hand, I was grateful for his “gift.” I wanted to know more. I *had* to know more.

The altar was more like a tomb than a slab of holy stone. The carvings told an elaborate tale of loyalty and betrayal. I-I didn’t know what to think. I-I looked up at him. His expression confirmed my suspicion. This was indeed his burial site.

His attire was the same. I had failed to notice the subtleties in his ensemble during our first encounter, due to my weakened state. He was dressed more for combat than sport. His long, brilliant robe shimmered like the stars that blanketed the windy winter night.

“Is this a dream?”

“No.”

“Then what is it?”

“A vision.”

“How? How are you doing this?”

“This is how I commune with my children.”

“How did you become a... a...”

“A god?”

“Yeah.”

With a sinister smirk, he said, “I shall reveal no more until you prove yourself.”

“But how? I don’t get it?”

“Huh. A child is born naked and unaware into a world that overflows with suffering. And like a child, you have been reborn. The cross is yours to bear. Prove yourself worthy and you will not be forsaken.”

Suddenly, out of nowhere, everything around me was set alight. The cathedral walls, the once magnificent artwork, even my creator. He stood there silent and stoic in the flames, staring at me the whole time.

The sight jolted me out of my slumber. I jumped up and glanced around in a fit of panic. It took a while for me to get ahold of myself. The whole thing was more disarming than alarming. His power was one that was going to take me a while to wrap my head around. After exhaling, I muttered to myself, “Thank God that’s over. I hope he doesn’t pull that stunt again.”

My relief was short lived, however. It was dusk. It was time. As much as I hated it; it had to be. A million thoughts collided into a million questions. I could feel the person I used to be slowly slipping. My hunger for revenge was all that mattered.

He who was once my friend was now my enemy. I was going to see to it that he paid. I wanted him to suffer. I wanted him to feel what I felt that night. It’s... it’s the *pain* that gets me every time. How I thought about them, my family, up until my final moments. I died in that basement, cold, alone, fearing the unknown.
