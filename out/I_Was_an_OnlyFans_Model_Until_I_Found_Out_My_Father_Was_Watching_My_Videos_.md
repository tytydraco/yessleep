I was a survivor of S/A by my mother's sperm donor. Calling him anything other than that is an insult to the wonderful fathers out there who nurture and protect their little ones. Mine was just a piece of shit, drunken bastard. 

The scars of my childhood aren't visible. They linger on the mind and manifest into feelings of despair and unprovoked anxious thoughts. 

It’s a hard thing to explain to somebody who had the fortune of a happy childhood. The very things that cause me debilitating anxiety, are the very things I seek out. 

I’m extremely fearful and distrusting of strange men, but seek out their approval by throwing myself at them when they give me the slightest bit of attention. 

I hate people staring at my body and get extremely anxious towards unwanted attention, but wear clothes that leave little to the imagination. It's like smoking crack, it makes you feel good for a brief moment but sends you spiralling down into a dark pit of despair and depression until you take another hit. 

I don’t take drugs, but my crack comes in the form of an Onlyfans account. I take my clothes off for a living and also for the brief dopamine rush I get when I get a like or comment on my videos. It feels good for a brief moment, but I spend the rest of the time hating myself. 

For most girls, onlyfans is fun, but for me, it’s a means to an end. It took a while but eventually, I started making a lot of money from it. 

I was too messed up for a 9 to 5, and could never hold down a job long enough to get anything meaningful from it in terms of living a comfortable life.

Now I have the security of owning a house and driving a nice car, and everything else that comes with having money. 

It would be hard for me to give that up, but recently something strange has been happening that has me questioning everything. 

It started with a comment left on one of my videos. 

The video of me was only up for about 10 minutes before I got a notification for a comment. 

“Looking good Sweet Bean.” 

When I read it the same fear I felt back when my father entered my room as a child came flooding back. 

My body went stiff as if held in a vice-like grip by some invisible hand, the same way my body went as a child under the sheets as my father loomed over me, before leaning down and whispering in my ear, “It’s only me Sweet bean.”

It’s strange, I remember as a child hoping the monster under my bed would take me, so I would be free from the monster that entered my room every night. 

I tried searching for the account that left the comment, but It didn’t seem to exist. “Maybe the person that made it deleted it,” I thought to myself.

 I never told anyone about the things my father did or the fact his pet name for me was Sweet Bean. I put the comment to the back of my mind and put it down to a coincidence. 

About a week later after I finished recording another video someone started frantically Knocking on my door. The knocks were hard and echoed throughout the house. The knocks continued as I was opening the door, but I was shocked to find no one standing there. 

As I stood there I had the uneasy feeling someone was watching me. I looked around and couldn’t see anyone, but just as I was about to go back inside I looked down and spotted something on my doorstep. 

I picked up the teddy bear and instantly burst into tears. The first time my father assaulted me he bought me the same teddy bear, as a bribe or maybe a sorry not sorry sort of thing, I never understood his sick reasoning for the things he did. I had lost my teddy years ago, but this one had the same smell that I found comfort in as a child and the same loose eyeball that hung by a thread. 

After I had calmed down I managed to upload the video I had made. My head was still in a spin but I just did what I always did and dissociated from it. 

The video was up an hour before the messages started coming in. The messages were anonymous which I didn’t think was a feature of onlyfans. 

The first one read. “Looking as sexy as ever, Sweet Bean.”

The next one sent a cold shiver up my spine. And made me sick to my stomach. 

“I’m so proud of you Sweet Bean. It won’t hurt for long.”

I didn’t know who was sending the messages, or how they could know things that I have buried deep in my consciousness. Those were the words my father had said to me after the first time he… I can’t even bring myself to write it. 

All I could do was shut my laptop down as the messages continued to ping through. I shut myself in my bedroom locking my door before burying myself under my covers. 

I wasn’t sure how long I was laying there before I started to drift off, but I was suddenly jolted awake by the sound of footsteps. I was frozen with fear and couldn’t bring myself to look up as the footsteps got closer. I could feel a presence loom over me. I shut my eyes hoping whatever it was would go away, but I felt the pressure of a hand weighing down on my blanket as the distinct voice of my father whispered in my ear, “It’s only me Sweet Bean. I think I lay there screaming for an hour before realizing there was no one in my room. 

It took days for my nerves to settle to a point where I could start making rational decisions. Onlyfans was my only means of income and I had to will myself to get back to work. 

I went live once a week for my subscribers and it was a big source of my income. I set the camera up and started the show. 

The replies started to come in. It was usually men giving me instructions on what to do for them. As the replies came in, one caught my attention, it was from one of my regular subscribers. 

“Who’s the guy peeking out from behind the couch?”   

A cold shiver of dread crept up my spine. I slowly walked over and checked behind the couch, but nothing was there. 

When I went back to the laptop there was another comment. 

“He’s still there watching you.”

I collapsed the comments section which was blocking the view of my couch. I broke out in a cold sweat when I saw him. My father who had been dead for the past ten years was grinning at me with the same lustful look he had on his face whenever he came into my room as a child, peeking up from behind the couch. 

Suddenly another comment came from an anonymous sender. 

“I’m always watching Sweet Bean. Your biggest fan.”
