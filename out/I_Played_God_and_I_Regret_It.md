I’ve never been a strong man. I don’t gain a sense of accomplishment with such things.

But I have always been a smart man, for better or worse.

I like helping people with my new scientific discoveries. I’ve helped cure diseases; I’ve helped to develop “miracle” drugs. I’ve even helped to make power stations that can change the weather in a small radius. All that good stuff.

But I went too far in my pursuit of greatness this time.

I tried to play God and I paid the price.

I was always fascinated by the world of science. Even when I was a little kid it always stood out to me more than other subjects.

I think the first real introduction to this field of study was in seventh grade when my teacher had us learn about animal and plant cells.

The concept of mitosis and knowing a cell could do something like that fascinated me to no end. As soon as I got home, I begged my mother to bring me to the library so I could read the science books.

In addition to cell study, I thoroughly researched all sorts of animals as to get an idea of what their biology was like.

I never did go anywhere with animal studies, but my obsession with science only grew stronger the more I learned about it.

My sophomore year of high school, our science teacher, Mr. Rourke, told us that we were to do an experiment for our final. The only requirement?

“Impress me.”

During this time, I had fallen slightly more in line with animal biology as it helped to have an idea of how the entire body of something worked.

Specifically, I had begun to research reproduction, and more importantly; *regeneration*.

I was completely and utterly obsessed with the thought that something could not only survive mutilation, but make themselves whole again.

It was completely alien, yet it made sense. It’s a strange balance.

I settled on the Planaria, a carnivorous Flatworm known most for their regeneration. I had found the subject of my project.

Now, as it turns out, you can find these little guys pretty easily in the United States. All I needed was some catchers, but I lived near a fishing shop so that was likely the easiest part.

With my subject chosen and my method of obtaining it within my grasp, I was ready to finally start working on my project.

Since you can’t really do something for the whole day during school, I waited for the weekend to try and catch my little worm friends.

Having a car makes things a lot easier, so I drove to a few different bodies of fresh water in my town and set up the catchers.

I figured I’d wait a day before going back and checking.

What was the worst that could’ve happened?

Having placed the traps in the water on Saturday, I chose to check them on Sunday.

To my complete and utter astonishment, I had actually been successful in my endeavors.

It wasn’t much, but I managed to catch three. For the contents of my project, it was going to work.

I had already bought everything else I needed for the project; a water tank, tools, all that stuff.

Oh, I guess I forgot to mention just what my intentions for this project was.

I was going to see just how much these little guys could take before they couldn’t regenerate anymore.

Cruel, I know, but they can’t feel pain so I’d say that makes it slightly less horrible.

I started by simply cutting one in half.

My plan was to harm each one to the point at which regeneration would be needed and then record how long it would take for it to regenerate, if at all.

I cut the worm in half, and began a recording. A Timelapse, of course.

The second worm was going to have to endure a bit more.

I decided that instead of cutting this one in half, I’d crush it completely.

It was terrible, no need to ask how I felt. But I did it anyways.

For the last one, I had a bit of trouble figuring out what to do with it.

Then, I went to the bathroom.

There, I found a bottle of hydrochloric acid. I got an idea, a terrible, terrible idea.

“Only a little bit.” I told myself as I reached for it. “Only a little bit. I won’t kill it.”

I diluted the acid with a lot of water. This was years ago so I can’t really remember the details, but it was enough to cause superficial damage to the worm.

I poured the acid on it, and it burned up slightly before laying flat.

I then added water to each segment in the tank and began my 1–2-week long recording.

Mr. Rourke had given us 3 weeks to finish the final, so all I had to do was gather my recordings, make a document listing everything I studied and hopefully get a least an A on this thing.

I was one of the only students not doing anything at their desk in the class, so I wasn’t too surprised when Mr. Rourke called me up to the front.

I obliged and went up to his desk.

“Hey, you called me up? Is something wrong?”

“No, nothing is wrong.” He responded. “It’s just, you’re not doing anything, is your project at home?”

“Oh!” I exclaimed. “No—no, sorry. Yeah, my project is at home. It’s a Timelapse kind of thing, so not exactly ‘at-school-desk’ work.”

He looked puzzled, and then curious.

“Ray.” He replied. “What are you doing for your project?”

“I won’t say too much, but I’m experimenting with just how much an organism can take before it gives out.”

He looked shocked.

“Jesus, like, actual animals?”

“No, just worms.”

“Okay. Well, I hope you know what you’re doing. Playing God doesn’t always work out.”

“Ah.” I replied. “Don’t think I’m playing God, I’m just seeing how things work, I’m experimenting!”

“If you say so. Good luck with it!” He said, and gave me a pat on the shoulder.

The next two weeks were pretty nerve wracking. Not because anything my life made me that way, but because I was anticipating how the worms would fare.

And then, two weeks after I mutilated the three worms, I checked the results.

I checked on the first one.

To my complete astonishment, it had regenerated itself and essentially created a new worm. I was elated!

It didn’t make two worms, but I wasn’t too upset about it considering that it wasn’t the main objective. I checked the next one.

Despite the complete crushing of it, this little worm also managed to regenerate. Amazing.

I’ll spare you the details, but even the acid worm regenerated. I was absolutely floored. My experiment had worked, and I caught it all on tape!

I had played God and it was a huge success.

I whipped up a document detailing each worm’s condition and how it wired in general. Cited my sources, formatted it correctly and put the Timelapse on a hard drive.

I was going to blow everyone out of the water with this.

And one week later, as I suspected. The project was a complete success.

Mr. Rourke came to me after the final class and requested a one-on-one.

“Raymond. You know I don’t pick favorites. But I have to say… I think that may have been my favorite project any student has done.”

“Ah, thanks Mr. Rourke. It was quite interesting, I think I want to do more research in this field, it’s fascinating stuff.”

“Well. It was good teaching you. I just hope you keep one thing in mind.” He said as I was exiting the classroom.

“Oh? And what’s that?”

“Be careful when you play God, you never know what could go wrong.”

And that was the last I saw of him.

You probably know the rest.

Went on to study Cytology at some high-end university. Graduated, found different jobs and all that.

So, where did that leave me? Well, my next plan of action was clearly to create medicine using the DNA of the Planarian.

I already had a great reputation among the science community, so when I pitched my idea to create a cure for injuries using the biology of a flatworm, all I was asked was;

“How long will it take?”

It took a long time, years, years that will stand out to me as some the most important in my life.

And then I met Andrea.

It was at a science convention, funnily enough. Some up and coming brain surgeon was talking my ear off about “neuroscience” this and “brain stem” that. 

I was about to tell him that I saw a future in his eyes when she ran into me by accident.

“Oh, sorry!” She said, turning around to see who she’d just run into.

That was when we stopped.

There, for a moment, it was just the two of us.

She was tall, hazel-eyed with long auburn hair and freckles. She was beautiful, and I realized there for the first time that I had never really been in love before.

Andrea changed that.

“Oh—it’s okay. I’m fine, really!”

“No, look!” She exclaimed. “I spilled something on your shirt.”

It was true, she had spilled some sticky beverage and it was quickly making for a crusty stain on my shirt.

“Oh no, really, it’s fine.” I responded.

“Nonsense.” She responded. “I’m sure there’s something for drinks here. Let me buy you one!”

Once more, I’ll spare you the details, but we entered that convention separately and walked out together. I don’t believe in love at first sight, but Andrea proved me wrong.

Life only proceeded to get better from there on out.

I proposed, we got married, bought a house, a dog, all that stuff. It was wonderful and all at the same time, I was still able to forward my career.

“Raymond Faire, brilliant Cytologist, known for…” Yeah.

I had just gotten home from a conference deciding on whether a new medicine should be regulated or not when Andrea broke the news to me.

*Two lines*.

We were going to be parents.

The pregnancy wasn’t easy, but having a scientist in the house certainly made it less unbearable.

Then, months and months after complications, pains and a multitude of things, Andrea gave birth to a baby boy.

On February 23^(rd), Thomas Faire was born.

Life was wonderful. We were living comfortably, Thomas was growing up to be an excellent young man, and my marriage was stronger than ever.

I finally finished the first prototype of the Plana Drug, nearly 12 years after I first started developing it.

As I put it into a vial, the words of my old high school science teacher came back to me.

“Playing God doesn’t always work out.”

I laughed. “Well, it did for me, Mr. Rourke.”

For a time, at least.

It was during the afternoon that I got the call.

My wife and son had been in an accident. A *bad* one.

Doing the right thing, I obviously abandoned whatever project I was working on and zipped over to where the accident happened.

In the hour that I was there, my life as I knew it ended.

My wife and child were dead. Killed instantly in the impact. Reports say they were both crushed from the waist down. It was a drunk driver, wasn’t paying attention to the road, hit them head on.

Instantly. Instantly, all of what I had worked for in my life was taken away so easily. The authorities said there was no chance of them living and that I should start sorting their stuff out:

I wasn’t ready to give up so easily.

I’m ashamed that I did it, but hours after their passing, I broke into the morgue they were being held in. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I couldn’t bear to think of life without them.

To my surprise, there wasn’t a lot in the way of security, and I was able to get in and out without much trouble.

I had only one thought in my head for the entirety of the drive home.

“You two are coming back. If God wills it.”

As soon as I hit the driveway, I was out of the car and dragging the corpses into the house. They were coming back, they had to.

I wasn’t sure if I could handle things without them.

I brought them down to the basement where my “lab” was, and laid their bodies out on the two tables. I then went over to my solutions and picked out the two vials I needed.

“Plana Drug.”

As I readied the injection, the words of Mr. Rourke continued to ring out in my ears.

“Playing God doesn’t always work out.”

I needed this.

“Playing God doesn’t always work out.”

I couldn’t listen to my thoughts.

“Playing God doesn’t always work out.”

Well, it was going to have to work out; I wouldn’t be able to go on if it didn’t.

I injected both Andrea and Thomas with the Plana and brought them up to their respective beds. I’d check on them in the morning.

Decisions of a madman or desperate choices made by a grieving, used-to-be father and husband? I was walking the line, but I was also dangerously close to falling in on both sides.

When morning came, I would find out which side I fell in.

When I awoke, it was in the arms of my loving wife.

I looked over and, while a bit dirty from all of the morgue preparations, there was my wife, beautiful as the day I met her and as beautiful as she’d ever be.

“Hey, sweetie. How’re you feeling?” She asked, putting a hand on my cheek.

“I’m doing better, now.” I responded before kissing her.

I couldn’t believe my luck, the drug I had spent the better part of 13 years making had worked. I was able to bring my wife and son back to life.

The Planarian DNA had repaired them.

I had played God and it worked out.

Of course, something had to change.

And it did one day when I found my son, sitting in front of the open fridge door, gnawing on a raw chicken that was supposed to be for dinner.

“Tommy? What’re you doing, buddy?”

He looked at me with carnivorous eyes.

“I was hungry and I wanted meat. So, I’m eating.”

I suppose I should have suspected something, but Tommy was a growing boy.

I only wondered why it was raw chicken of all things that he chose to eat.

We ate something else.

The days went on.

I caught my wife wolfing down several pieces of fish in the living room and got only the same response from her. I was starting to get worried about the wellbeing of our family.

It was jarring when I caught both of them eating.

The last experience with my son is what nearly sent me over the edge.

I came up from the basement one day to a horrifying scene.

There, in the middle of the living room, was Tommy. He was eating the carcass of a squirrel.

I lectured him on why he shouldn’t do that and asked where his mother was.

“Eating the meatballs.” She had been eating the meat for the dinner we were going to have that night.

I felt like I was losing it but I tried to stay positive about this. They just needed to get used to their new lives and eventually, everything would be okay.

I couldn’t call the cops, because, you know, I stole from a goddamn morgue.

I shouldn’t have ignored the signs.

We ended up ordering takeout that night. I noticed that the ravenous hunger was shared between the two of them, as by the time I had gotten halfway through my meal, they were already done and looking for something else to eat.

“What’s with you guys?” I asked, putting my fork down. “We have more food if you’re so hungry!”

My wife turned around and looked at me with the same eyes my son had earlier that day.

“We’re hungry. We want meat, so we’re going to eat.”

They ended up clearing out nearly the whole fridge before going to bed. I had to do something in the basement.

I was going to study just what was causing them to act like such animals.

As I set up the microscope, I could hear noises upstairs.

It sounded like someone was crawling around on their hands and feet.

I wasn’t able to get a good look at the Plana sample. I heard the basement door open.

“Dad.”

“Honey.”

It was them.

“We’re hungry. There’s no food.”

I looked up the stairs and there they were, crouching and looking at me.

“What’s wrong with you guys?!” I yelled. “Why are you so hungry?”

My wife was the one to respond.

“Don’t know. Just wanna eat.”

I was exasperated. What the hell was happening?

“WHAT DO YOU WANT TO EAT?!”

My wife, with a hungry look in her eyes, grabbed Tommy’s hand and responded.

“We want to eat you, we’re so hungry.”

I ran; I locked myself in my utility closet before they could get to me.

That’s where I am now, waiting and typing this.

I think the worm DNA spliced with theirs and created something entirely different. I don’t think that’s my wife and son anymore.

All is silent except for the occasional “meat”, “food”, or “let us in.”

I wish I had never discovered those goddamn worms. I wish I had never gotten such positive feedback on that project.

I wish I had taken Mr. Rourke’s advice to heart. I was so busy trying to find out if I could do this stuff, that I didn’t stop to wonder if I should.

Please, for your sake, don’t make the same mistakes I did.

Don’t try to play God, because I did.

And it *didn’t* work out.
