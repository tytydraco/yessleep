I caught my Dad talking to my mother. That’s how it started. The thing is, she passed away three years ago.

I went to his house to check in on him. He hadn’t called anyone for three weeks. He’s seventy five; still capable, but retired and lonely. He was so close to my mother that we all assumed after she passed that he wouldn’t be too far behind her.

I surprised him that day. I didn’t call him ahead of time, I just showed up.

I was going to announce myself, but when I opened the door, I heard a familiar voice. Familiar, but off somehow. It was my mother. He was having a conversation with her. The door to his office was cracked and when I looked in, I saw my mother on his monitor. They were talking about politics, their favorite subject, and her responses were in a present tense, talking about things she wouldn’t know.

When I finally said something, he got up and ran out of his office.

He told me what it was. 

One of those grief AI programs that prey on people who can’t move on. He had bought the damn thing for thousands of dollars. He fed it images and video and audio. What came out of that was an eerie digital clone of my mother on the screen. He told me he was using it to deal with his loneliness. The fucking thing said hi to me while he was trying to explain what it was. I wanted to break his computer.

“It’s like she’s back from the dead, son. I know this is… different… but it’s letting me relive the best parts of my life. The happiest times. The times that mean the most to me.” He urged me to talk to her.

I couldn’t even say anything. I left.

Time went on.

We saw less and less of him. My siblings wanted me to go by and demand that he stop talking to “mom”, but none of them would come with me.

He missed Thanksgiving with the family last week, so on Friday morning, I went back to his house. 

Once again, I let myself inside of our family home, and once again, my dad was in his office talking, but he was whispering this time. When I opened the door, my dad jumped and fumbled around as he tried to turn off his screen.

His face was different from the face I had always known. Drawn and gaunt. He looked like he hadn’t slept or eaten in days. There was a brief flash of a primal rage in his eyes that scared me. For a moment, I actually thought he was going to hurt me, but then his face changed back to the one I have always known.

It wasn’t my mother he was talking to this time. It was a young woman that I didn’t know. Her hair and her makeup looked like it was from the 1970’s. I caught a brief glimpse of her before the monitor went black.

It didn’t go well. Apparently, he had created an AI of his old girlfriend from high school. 

“The one that had got away”, he said.

I was furious. He started to stammer these weak apologies. He pleaded with me to understand how lonely he was. I grabbed his laptop and turned to leave, not thinking of anything better to do. My father had always been faithful to my mother, or so I had thought. After seeing what he was doing, I started to question everything about a man I had always respected.

He followed me outside. He asked me if there was anything wrong with hitting the “highlight reel” now that mom was gone. He begged me to give him his laptop back and I did.

I couldn’t even say anything to him.

It felt like I had caught him cheating, even though she’s been gone for a while. I got in my car and drove home.

That night I talked to my wife about it all. I didn’t know what I was going to say to my siblings. My wife told me to sleep on it. I agreed with her. I dozed off on the couch and when I woke up, she was watching one of her cold case crime shows. She’s absolutely obsessed with those things. It took a second for my eyes to focus and when they finally did, I recognized an old picture that came on the television. The woman I had seen on my father’s computer. The screen switched to that same woman in 2024. She was recounting how she had escaped a killer in 1975, but the friend that was with her was not so lucky.

I watched the show for maybe five minutes. I was in shock. I picked up my phone.

I turned my father in.

He was taken into custody without incident.

After looking through his computer yesterday, the police have found thirty chatbots on his “highlight reel” that he talks to for hours at a time. AI likenesses based on men, women, and children who had either gone missing or were found murdered in the 1970’s.

They had been programmed to beg my father to stop hurting them; to let them [rest](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyhorribles/).
