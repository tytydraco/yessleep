When I lie down to go to bed, I don’t think I fall asleep anymore. My body will feel tired at seven, eight, or nine, but the second I’m flat on that mattress I get overwhelmed with a massive burst of energy. All of the tiredness is flushed out of my body in seconds, and it’s like I chugged an entire cup of expresso. I get all wired and antsy. 

They’re my nocturnal panic attacks. Before, I used to only get them once every two weeks. I get them frequently now, and I’ve dealt with them for so long that I understand how this rolls now. When I lay down and my mind instantly starts to race, I immediately give up any and all hopes of getting six or more hours of sleep. If I’m tossing and turning with ease, I’m lucky if I get four. If sleeping with my eyes open or close doesn’t make a difference, there’s always tomorrow night. 

I’ve been dealing with them for the past couple weeks. Part of me knows why, but I haven’t had the guts to actually write it down. Tonight, I just know it’s going to be a bad. It’s pointless to even bother with trying to sleep at this point, so I might as well save myself the time by posting my story to this forum. 

I work at a thrift store: one of those places that accepts peoples old junk and resells it to suckers, I mean, customers. The pay is decent, and my manager is this nice old guy. He can be strange and paranoid at times, but he really does look out for his employees and even the customers. Yeah, I hate our customers. They can vary from weirdos to complete ghouls, but the best way I could possibly describe them is like taking all of Walmart’s nightly customers and dropping them in the middle of the day time. I thank God that our store doesn’t stay open late because only God knows what breed of psycho wants to buy our junk at 2:00 in the morning. How do I even begin to describe what happened that day? 

It was mostly the same old work. The guys in the back brought in the stuff that was recently donated, and I, along with my coworkers, stocked the shelves. 

My manager, I’ll call him Greg, is very particular with how we handle and inspect the merchandise, especially when it comes to the furniture. I’m sure you’ve all heard of the strange things people have found in random old furniture. Greg’s a veteran in this game; he’s seen it all. It’s for this reason that we are to, with every single new addition of furniture, check inside to find anything… undesirable. 

Greg can be a little cooky when it comes to this. One time, he took out a box cutter and started to cut into this arm chair. We all stared in silence as he rummaged around inside the thing, and with a pissed off look on his face, he pulled out a dead rat. It was like he had a sixth sense for this shit, and maybe if you all are interested, I might post some of his stories he’s told us about the shit he finds. 

That day, I was in the back with my coworkers. Apparently, we received an entire apartment’s worth of furniture as a donation. We all didn’t really think about it at the time, but it’s possible that all of those items could have been someone estate. In hindsight, I really wish I had kept this in my mind beforehand. 

We were used to old people stuff, but this, this was different. Some of this furniture was the kind of stuff I could find in my own flat. The appliances were all new too. 

Out of all of the furniture, I was given the task of dealing with the couch. Part of me wishes I had just slapped a price tag on it and called it a day, leaving that cursed thing to be someone else’s problem, but I had a job to do. I could hear Greg’s voice in my mind, just telling me to check it. 

The legs of the couch were… peculiar. They were a cold dark oak, but at their base, there was this ivory marble like material that shined on the bottom. It was kind of gorgeous, but part of it looked hand fashioned. There were splinters in the wood, and when you sat on it, the cushions almost sucked into the behind area of the couch. It felt hollowed out on the inside. 

Apparently, this was one of those couches that had a bed inside it, so removing the cushions, I pulled out the makeshift bed to inspect it. What I found made me cackle to the point of exhaustion. 

Jeff the Killer used to always make me laugh. Ever since it got popular back in the day, I would revel at the embarrassingly bad writing, the terrible grammar, and the failed attempts at ‘horror’. Even before I read the story, I knew it was gonna be some twelve year olds take on a serial killer. Jeff… the Killer, the name alone sounded like someone’s personal fan fiction. It was hot garbage. 

By itself, the image used to unnerve me. There was no source for it in the slightest. It just manifested from the depths of the old web, and like a ghost, it floated around from forum to forum. 

However, the second that I associated that image with that shitty story. I couldn’t help myself but laugh in the face of it. My old high school friends printed it out one time before slipping on my desk between bathroom breaks. I still remember how hard I laughed. Everyone else was convinced that I was crazy. Those were good times. 

So, when I opened this thing up and found that stupid picture looking back at me, I immediately bursted into laughter. It was like a poor man’s jump-scare. My laughter kept me from even noticing the piece of paper that was lying near it. 

At first, I was convinced that one of my coworkers had to have planted the image between my bathroom break, but to be honest, I never really had that kind of relationship with my coworkers. 

Still, I asked, and none of them admitted to placing it there. Once again, I kind of looked a little crazy. At the time, I just figured it was the owner (or maybe the universe) playing a joke on me. 

Eventually, when my laughter died down, I reentered work mode, but as I was about to throw the picture away, my eyes caught a glimpse of some barely legible handwriting on a piece of notebook paper. Curious, I leaned down and checked the image again. 

It was… different. I mean, same as it was before, but because of how funny the situation was, I hadn’t actually paid attention to the details in the picture. It wasn’t a one for one print out of the original: the background was different, the face wasn’t in the right place, and it didn’t look photoshopped in the slightest. It looked somewhat like someone’s real face, but in a lot of other ways, it seemed… fake. Like, if I looked at it only for a few seconds, I would have assumed it was some AI generated realistic recreation. 

My curiosity was peaked, so I just had to read what was hastily written down on that wrinkled notebook paper. Sitting down on the outstretched bed, I made myself comfortable and then read the following:

Go to sleep. 
Go to sleep. 
I was gifted a new pair of eyes
My deceitful woes now see within a path of lies
A field of sand, of visions and dreams
I sent him there by my guiding hands. 
He’s enwrapped in the arms of the sandman now
For once, I could smile,
I could laugh,
I felt alive, awake while the sheep slept.
All he had to do was rest, sleep.
He would stay up all night, but not anymore.
I helped him, shaped him into a new form, 
and I can help you too
You will sleep well soon.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep. 

It was eerie, but honestly, it wasn’t the weirdest thing that we had found over the years: random numbers etched beneath desks, little slips of paper with random coordinates to a Russian mine (that’s real), and notes in some foreign language we were all unfamiliar with. I, along with the rest of the staff, knew it was really nothing in comparison, but still, I called over Greg to let him know. 

He eyed it up and down for a few seconds before shaking his head. 
“We’re not selling this,” he said plainly. 
I then asked him why to which he suddenly became very stoic in his expression. “I’ve been around long enough to just… know some things,” he said, “and that couch gives me a bad feeling.”

Strangely, I protested him. “C’mon,” I said. “Some weird kid probably just left his art and poetry in it. It’s nothing to psyche yourself out over.”

“If you want it,” he replied, “you can take it, cause we’re not selling it. Besides, the legs appear to have been damaged, so the things a liability.”

At the time, I was desperate. My last couch was about the same size, but it was, quite literally, on its last legs. The leather on the cushions had entirely been eroded, so it was kind of embarrassing to have my friends come over and see that. In my head at the time, I was only thinking about how good the cushions looked and the overall condition. I had nearly forgotten about the weird note and the picture. Some plans floated around in my mind about possibly repairing the cracks in the legs with some wood glue or something like that.

I agreed to take it off his hands, to which he begrudgingly accepted. In all my years working for the man, I had never seen him so quiet. He barely spoke for the rest of my shift, and it was only during closing that he gave me a firm goodbye before leaving me to deal with the couch. My interaction with him kept replaying through my thoughts on the drive back to my apartment. 

Carrying the damn thing wasn’t easy. It was heavier than most couches I’ve handled, and I had been stocking furniture for at least a couple years. That couch had to have been as dense as a neutron star. I had to call a friend for some extra help; it was that heavy. 

After we carried the thing in, we had to then carry out the old couch. I said my goodbyes before we carried that out to the dumpster, and through the process, the comparison was night and day. I barely needed my friend to help in the slightest, and at one point, he kind of just watched me do all the heavy lifting. Like I said, I was used to stocking furniture, so it should have been no problem for me. 

My friend then left, and I celebrated by passing out on my new couch. The work was worth it for how comfortable that nap was. When I woke up on my day off, I knew I had to share this, so I called up my girlfriend.

She was really happy to see that I got rid of that old couch, and though she was concerned with the cracks in the legs, she found it a great improvement. We watched some shows and then made out. I’ll spare you the details, but at this point, I was far from feeling regretful about taking it in. That couch was by all means a steal. 

After only a couple days, I had completely forgotten about the picture and the strange note. Hell, I had forgotten that I put them in the back of my junk drawer along with the rest of my nonsense. But, after only a week, things started to change. 

It was subtle at first. My route to work felt… off one day. With my concentration on the road most of the time, it was difficult to place it, so I ignored it. The feeling compounded with each drive there and back, and after three days, my eyes started to drift off the road. I almost got into accident; it was that bad. 

At work, things were worse. After only a few days, I couldn’t go into work mode or autopilot anymore. There was no way of tuning out the feeling, so I dwelled on it.

My coworkers were the first to point it out. I was more aware and vigilant, and almost instinctually, my eyes kept glancing at the windows in the front, expecting someone to be there watching. 

One time, for a split second, I caught a glimpse of a figure standing on the other side of the street. He was just… standing there. I wasn’t quite sure what he looked like at the time, but he was pale. Or, at least he was wearing white. 

Eventually, one of my coworkers asked if everything was alright, and I told him that I may have a stalker. He then informed management before offering to watch me to make sure I get into my car, to which I can’t understate how relieving that felt. I didn’t really think I was being stalked, but the situation was starting to feel off in that way. 

At the end of that day, nothing else happened, but by that point, my mind had already slipped. I had so many plans with friends that I would cancel last minute, and not even my girlfriend was an exception. I couldn’t even do basic chores like the dishes, laundry, or the garbage. My original plan to seal up the cracks never went anywhere. I had no more ambition, so I started to just rot. 

At the end of one shift, the guy who usually spotted for me wasn’t there, so I walked to my car alone. On the other side of the parking lot, there was a man in a white-grayish hoody. I kept my distance, but he never moved toward me. He just stood there, but I just knew he was staring at me. 

When I sat down in my car, I immediately checked my rear view mirror, only to find that he was gone. He completely vanished… like a specter. With my hands on the steering wheel, I sat and thought about the situation for a second. A small smile grew on my face, and then, I laughed. A man with pale skin in a white-grayish hoodie? I couldn’t help but think about that stupid fucking story and laugh. 

I laughed hard. I couldn’t bring myself to even start the engine, but when I got that feeling again, I stopped. I checked my rearview mirror, then my side views, but when I look out my driver side window, I saw him. He didn’t have a gun or a knife, not a single weapon in sight. All he did was just… stare, a wide grin plastered on his face.

I wish I could say that I sped out of there, but that didn’t happen. While maintaining direct eye contact, I turned on my engine and pulled out of my spot. In my rearview mirror, he was just… there. He didn’t move an inch; my clear discomfort never seemed to bother him even the slightest. 

When I got my back to my apartment, I was constantly looking over my shoulder, just waiting for that psycho to pop up, but he never did. In fact, that day would be the last I saw him on, but at the time (and even now), I was assure that I would be seeing him again… in some way. 

After a long day at work, I plopped down on the couch only to be met with a startling crack. I instantly stood up; it took a couple seconds for the context to register in my mind. After a week of going without repair, the cracks in the legs of the couch finally completely snapped. 

At this point, I recalled the picture and the poem. My face was a pale white. I scrambled, scouring desperately to find that photo. In the back of my junk drawer, it was right where I left it. 

That face was identical to the man from the parking lot. The man who had been stalking me for at least two weeks now. I was beginning to lose my mind over this, but I couldn’t stop.

I ran back to the couch with some tools. To tell the truth, even I was struggling to believe it. I needed proof, but I just wasn’t sure where to look. Then, I recalled that memory with Greg and how he cut a hole inside.

Like a madman, I slowly pushed until I get it to land on its side, exposing its soft underbelly. This protective sheet beneath had something that I failed to notice when I first inspected it. There was a line of barely noticeable stitches in the fabric. They were so subtle, but they were there. 

I took a box cutter and cut into it, and inside, I stuck my hands in to feel around. Among the functions for the bed, there was a small disk shaped object. I pulled it out, and it was white. It took me a moment, but then, I realized. It was a fucking AirTag. 

My friend has one in his car in case it gets stolen. They can basically sync with a phone, and that user will know the location of whatever they put the AirTag on.

Someone psycho put a fucking AirTag in this couch, and now, they had my location. But, little did I know, I only scratched the surface. I was already about to call the cops, but after what I found, there was no other option.

Deeper in the underside of the couch, I found another note. It read as the following:

You will sleep well soon. 
I helped him rest, but there was simply too much of him. 
He now splinters the wood. 

My mind instantly jumped to the deep crack in the leg of the couch. With my phone as a flashlight, I shine the light to try see what was in the wood. 

What I saw in that split in the wood still lingers in the back of my mind. Even as I write this, I can’t even fathom it. 

I had kept that thing in my house. I made out with my girlfriend on it. For several weeks, I had sat and even slept on it. All that time, I had no clue what was I sitting on. 

There were human bones inside it. Inside that split in the wood, there was a fucking leg bone, but apparently, there was so much more. The police had to take the thing apart to find all of them. 

I told them everything: the photo, the notes, and even the fact that I saw him. He was right in front of my car window. That psycho was only a few feet away from me. 

So, I haven’t really been able to sleep a lot recently. At first, the cops were sure that I would be fine. I insisted to them, though, so they offered to have a cop watch over my place at night. 

It’s a little reassuring to know that someone is there, but still, it’s done little to help with my nocturnal panic attacks. I’ve been considering the possibility of getting a new job because I really don’t want to go back to that place. At this point in time, I might even move places as well.

This whole situation is so exhausting. I can’t even laugh at that stupid story anymore. I’ve heard of what happened in Waukesha with those twelve year old girls, and now, I get it. There is just something wrong with people in this world, and that is the real nightmare fuel. 

Some stupid story passes over the internet, and at least one psychopath will get inspired. That’s the real horror of this world, not some poorly written story passed over the internet. It’s not some picture that was made in photoshop of some random woman’s face in a closet. It’s the face of someone you might pass by on the street: the face of someone with no life behind their eyes, no light in their soul. 

I don’t even care anymore. I’m so done with this situation, but since I have nothing better to do, I might as well post this. Maybe you will find something of use in my story. I don’t really care. I just want to be done with this situation. 

My eyes are barely able to stay open to even reread this. I had gotten barely any sleep last night, so I think I’m gonna call it quits here. Right now, I’m gonna go to sleep. Here’s hoping I may rest well soon. Goodnight ya’ll.
