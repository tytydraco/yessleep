*Transcript of the audio logs of the Carnival of Pain, during the year \[REDACTED\]*

*00:00*

Hello? I hope this is working. They told me to keep speaking to this for training purposes. I don’t know what good it would do to listen to a brand new security guard prattle about the job, but I guess it might be for teaching me my mistakes.

Anyways, yeah. I am not supposed to give my real name, so that’s it for the introduction, I suppose. Nothing to do now but wait until I do the rounds, so not much else to say.

*01:13*

Okay this is not funny. Apparently someone thought it was a good idea to prank the new guy and has climbed to the top of the roller coaster station. On the station, mind you, not even inside. I can’t describe them clearly as the lights aren’t on, but it seems to be a woman with long hair that’s flapping in the wind. She is just standing there, seemingly looking towards me, like a total creep.

I am gonna go up there and give her a piece of my mind.

**Coroner’s report**

All four limbs fractured with multiple breaks. The subject was probably dragged on the rail tracks with the head held up to prevent immediate death. The speeds required to inflict these injuries are not consistent with the normal speeds of the ride.

While there is incredible blood loss due to prolonged bleeding, death only occurred when the neck was finally bitten off, with the subject likely still conscious. Teeth marks do not match any known land animal.

**Rules**

**1.** If you see a woman standing atop the roller coaster station, do not approach her. Continue your rounds normally and return to the office.

Hello, my name is - wait, I am not supposed to tell my name. Is this just a recording, or is someone listening on the other side? Because someone on the last shift seems to have left a note to scare me, haha.

I wouldn’t have taken up a job as the night guard if I was that easy to scare, so it’s not gonna work! I will check back after my rounds.

*01:15*

Everything is quiet so far, like it should be. Paid attention to the roller coaster to see if anyone had placed a mannequin or anything up there, but I guess that would be too much effort for a joke.

Noticed one odd thing though: a horse seems to be missing from the carousel. I don’t imagine anyone could have uprooted and stolen it, so it must have been missing already. Strange. You would imagine the carnival owners would fix a major ride like that immediately.

*02:08*

What the fuck? I was checking the camera footage, and I just idly looked at the carousel - the fucking horse is back. I can swear there was a missing spot when I had gone on my last round, but now there is no missing horse. It’s like the horse came alive, went trotting and came back.

Is someone playing tricks on me?

*02: 21*

(Heavy breathing)

Someone is here. I went to check out the carousel, and since there was no trace of tampering with it, continued with my round. Everything else looks normal too, but I felt like someone was watching me. I abruptly turned, and saw a white figure standing some way behind me, staring at me with a red grin on its painted face, absolutely motionless.

I would have taken it for a statue had I not already done a round before and knew there was no such thing. I think I screamed, and ran for the office. I glanced back as I ran and sure as hell, that clown was chasing me, though he moved slowly.

I don’t know what the fuck is going on, but I am looking through the cameras and the clown is still standing some way off outside the office door, staring straight at the camera. He doesn’t seem armed, so it’s probably some weirdo playing smart with me.

Well, I have a gun and a baton, and I am sure as hell gonna use them.

**Coroner’s report**

The subject was tortured for hours, with the death taking place shortly before dawn due to a spike driven through the skull. The point of entry was through the right eye socket – the eyeballs were already plucked out earlier. No tools were apparently used, as the rupture was rough and probably done with the subject completely conscious.

A complete list of the extensive injuries and their likely means of infliction are included in a separate attachment. Note that the nature of the injuries and the traces found around the Carnival indicate the subject was taken to each of the attractions for each stage of the torture, before being killed back at the office.

**Rules**

**1.** If you see a woman standing atop the roller coaster station, do not approach her. Continue your rounds normally and return to the office.

**2.** Sometimes a horse on the carousel might be missing. In this case, return to the office immediately and monitor the CCTV footage. Do not leave again until the horse is back.

**3.** A clown will sometimes follow you. It will not close the distance itself, so just continue with your rounds and ignore it.

*00:02*

This is some sort of reality show, isn’t it? Gods I knew the job advertisement looked suspicious. That’s why they have this recording thing too, and cameras all over the place. This note with the strange rules is so spooky, seems like they have props and stuff set up already.

Haha, I am gonna show everyone that I am not easy to scare at all! Bring it on!

*01:03*

Went on my round, and saw a woman standing on the roller coaster thingie. I just ignored her and kept walking, haha. She must be feeling pretty embarrassed standing there without getting any reaction from me.

None of the other things mentioned in the note showed up, but something new did - the toy train was in operation when I passed it on my round. Kudos to their costume design people, because the headless kids sitting in it look so real, with the stumps of their necks red and rotting, flesh peeling from the sides.

I decided to prank them in return, so I went to the control panel and switched the thing off before the train could complete its circuit and come back to me. Hehe.

*02:11*

Please, if someone is listening, I want to leave. You got me, okay? I admit defeat. I am scared witless, you got me good. Now call it off. Please.

That thing is still floating out there, right over the pathway between the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars. I don’t know how you managed it, but jesus, I can’t look at all those bodies hanging on the hooks, dripping blood like that.

And the thing carrying the hook, it-it *wants* me. I just know it wants me, and it’s going to gut me and put me up on a hook too, oh god please let me go.

I am not going to do any more rounds. I will stay here until someone comes for me.

*03:05*

(Sobbing)

That thing… it suddenly started smiling. The blood is dripping, I can see from the cameras, but it has this terrible smile now.

Please save me, I don’t want to die.

H-hello? I found this note, and it’s really scaring me. I-I am not really suited for a security job, I just took it because I needed the money.

I don’t know what to do.

*01:12*

H-hello. I went on a round, and tried to follow the instructions. I didn’t see any woman, but I th-think the clown was following me. I just kept walking and didn’t look back. I hope he isn’t there when I go out again.

*02:03*

The clown was still there. It’s sc-scary, but the rules are right - it stays at a certain distance, and if I don’t look at it it’s alright.

I saw the train too. It was already halfway across, and I could see all those headless things sitting there. I-I was so afraid, I just froze there. The train almost made it back before I remembered to switch it off and run away. It counts, right?

*03:28*

(muffled crying)

That fl-floating thing appeared. It was so dreadful (whimpering). The note didn’t mention that one of the bodies on the hook was screaming. Oh lord, he was screaming in pain. Was that man st-still alive?

I don’t know how long I stood there. The thing was still dripping blood, but the rule said I had to walk through. I-I just ran. I think I screamed when the blood dripped onto my face, and everything after that is a blur.

But I managed to make it back. And I don’t see the thing in the CCTV anymore. Wait, so-something’s not right. Was there always a horse missing from that ride?

I-I dropped the note when I ran under that thing, I think. I don’t remember what I was supposed to do about the horse. Should I just stay here?

No, I remember it telling me that I should keep to my rounds no matter what. I will j-just find the note in this round and do what it says.

**Coroner’s report**

Subject has suffered injuries throughout the body consistent with trauma inflicted by iron-shod hooves. The shape is irregular, however, with a rectangular design more reminiscent of toy horses than an actual horse.

The spine was broken first, so the subject was probably paralyzed as the rest of their bones were systematically broken. The cause of death is blood loss, as no killing blow was made and the skull left intact.

*End of transcript*

Preliminary investigation complete. Case can be returned to the client with the list of rules for further management with the standard turnover rate. Refer to the Human Resources department for a contract to supply the required livestock.
