My job in tech sales brought me to Worcester Massachusetts a few weeks ago. My company put me up in a short term rental in the neighboring town of Leicester. I'm based out of Arizona and this is my first time visiting the New England area. I'm newly divorced, and the constant travel is a nice distraction. It gets me out of my head, and takes my mind off the shitshow failed marriage. Plus, I like people, and meeting new people and I'm good at my job, so work has been fairly rewarding and therapeutic. So I've just been immersing myself in it.

Massachusetts is beautiful, but cold, and the drastic lack of sun is hard to get used to. It fills me with a sense of somberness. The remaining leaves are falling rapidly, and the trees are becoming skeletons of their former selves. It's late November and it gets dark around 4pm here, which kind of compounds the dreariness. 

I've been sober from alcohol for about 8 months now. I haven't had an urge to drink at all until 2 days ago when I almost talked myself into going to the bar across the street from where I'm staying. The loneliness, the weather, it almost broke me. That's when I realized I needed to do something in my down time here, or the next urge.. I might not have the willpower to deny it. 

There was a big yard sale going on yesterday down the street and I saw a metal detector for sale for $40. Seemed perfect.. I can sightsee, get a little exercise, maybe find something cool. Who knows? It's better than sitting in my room with the shades drawn and thinking about whiskey. The homeowner, an older gentleman, saw me eyeing it and I struck up a conversation with him. Nice guy, his wife looked annoyed at how much time we spent talking, as she frantically handled all the potential customers on her own. I worked my sales-y charm and I got the detector for $20, and he even showed me how to use it, and threw in a backpack that had a small telescoping shovel, and miscellaneous metal detector accessories. He drew me crude maps of local spots where he said he had some luck finding things. 

I got up this morning a little late about 10:30, ate a big breakfast, put a comfy sweatshirt on and thick zip up hoodie and headed out to where the old man told me to go. 

The map led me to a big clearing in the woods, and my mood instantly improved. Oak trees everywhere. The fresh cold air stung my nostrils a little, but it was invigorating. I spent about an hour ambling about in the clearing with the detector, but no real hits on anything. In the distance I saw a yellow metal blockade and what looked like a path behind it. I think the old man had said something about a hiking path but I don't remember. It wasn't on the map he drew. I walked over to the path. Should I check it out or just stick with the map? I heard what sounded like water and a vague sound of wind chimes, must be a little brook or something. I thought it would be nice to just zen out by a small stream, so I crossed the yellow blockade and headed down the the path, and that's when things began to get a tad bit strange. I must have walked a mile down this path and the sound of water decreased, while the wind chime sound increased.. But the chimes were ringing at a full octave lower than what they were at the start of the path. Odd.

The sound of water eventually completely subsided, "So much for my water therapy moment." I continued walking, finally I came to something that looked.. Very old. A low stacked stone wall, with two large granite gate posts in the middle, with massive black wrought Iron gates in between them. The metal work was... Definitely unique. Two large circles with wavy lines that converged in the dead center. It looked like long creepy wild spider legs. Like a gate Stephen King would have adorning his garden. Ok, I needed to check my phone and see where the hell I was at. I got 3 bars out here.. Not bad. I pulled up google maps "Friends Quaker Cemetery" It was then I noticed all the obvious head stones through the gate. I was so captivated by the odd design of the iron that I hadn't even noticed them.

There was a sign in front of the stone wall. It read: "This is a private cemetery under the care of the Worcester Friends Meeting (Quakers) We hope that you will treat this cemetery as you would the one where your relatives and friends are buried. This cemetery is closed during the hours of darkness."

I can't go metal detecting in a fucking cemetery can I? That's not cool right? Well at least I can go look around I thought. I opened the gate and walked through.. An icy gust of wind blasted me as I set foot inside the cemetery, and now the otherworldly windchimes rang again loud as ever. I needed to find the source of these weird ass chimes. The graveyard was seriously old. Headstones from 1850, 1730, There was one from 1660! Massive oak trees peppered the landscape, with thick arm-like branches hypnotically swaying in the breeze.

I spent another hour just looking at these almost medieval age headstones. Thinking about what life must have been like in this town back in the 1660's. So many of these people died in their 30's and 40's.. That must have been considered old age back then. I was pretty far into the cemetery. Far enough that I couldn't see the border wall or the gates anymore. I found myself in this circular configuration of grave stones, the circle was about 50ft in diameter. The head stones were so old and weathered you couldn't read the inscriptions anymore. In the middle of the circle stood a giant tree, like something you would see in a children's fairytale book. The tree looked like an organic 3 pronged pitchfork. It had two thick branches on either side that arched upward into J shapes. Picture the Japanese martial arts weapon "sai" and imagine that as a gigantic tree.



Then I saw them..  Dangling menacingly from the hulking left branch. The chimes. There must be 12 of them.. 3ft long, each one tapered and came to a dagger point at the bottom. They were made from Industrial looking rusted metal and attached to the massive branch with an equally rusted metal chain. These are wind chimes you would expect to see in silent hill. The sound of them even more unnerving now. OK... I needed to research this cemetery.

I Pulled out my phone again. Two bars now.. I googled "friends cemetery" and immediately wished that I hadn't. Friends Cemetery is also known as "Spider Gates"(appropriate) Every result of the search was "Most haunted cemeteries in America, 8th gateway to hell, Satanic rituals, Hangings, dimensional portal." Not bullshitting you.. Google Spider Gates and see for yourself.

OOOkaaay.. Yeah.. I'm good with my little metal detecting adventure for today. It's quarter of three and it's going to get dark soon and I don't feel like spending anymore time in an actual urban legend.. I literally take one step away from the tree and the metal detector screeches to life.. The volume so extreme I thought it would burn out the little onboard speaker. Didn't I turn this thing off before I walked in here? I guess not.. I quickly flick the off switch and the ear piercing noise ceased. It's hard for me to describe my mindset in this moment because "I" don't even understand it. But, I HAD to see what was down there. It wasn't an option. I NEEDED to see.. A compulsion. 

I get out the little shovel in the backpack and start digging as if I was going to find the cure for cancer down there. I get about 2 feet down before I hear the clank of the shovel hit something metallic. It was an ornate silver box buried vertically. Real solid actual silver. It was about 9 inches wide and 5 inches long. 4 inch depth. Heavy and thick, it felt too heavy for how small it was, felt like 20+ pounds. I managed to wrestle the thing out of the ground. The design of the box had silver flowers and trees all over it, like little sculptures. How did they make this? The top of the box had what I can only describe as something resembling a "comedy/tragedy" type mask. But the expression wasn't happy or sad it's mouth was just wide open. There was a latch on the front with no lock on it.

It was stuck shut. I couldn't open it with my hands. I looked into the back pack. Flathead screw driver, bingo! I wedge the screwdriver into a little gap in the box just barely wide enough to get the tip of the driver in, I took one of the rocks I dug up and use it like hammer on the back of the flathead. I twist the screw driver and it pops open. I couldn't fully open it all the way, but I didn't need to. The inside was completely lined with a maroon velvet. Inside it, old parchment papers rolled up like a scroll. It had a black ribbon in the center securing it. I slid the ribbon off and unrolled the papers..

What in the actual fuck am I looking at?.. Everything on it looked like it was written in blood. OLD blood.. That dark burgundy color like when you see a month old band-aid in the trash. There were symbols I have never seen in my life. English letters and numbers in it, but the words were not English. Some of it looked mathematical or related to geometry. Blood paintings of strange humanoid nightmare figures encircled by gibberish words. It was like a malevolent version of the Voynich Manuscript.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich\_manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript)

I got to the last piece of parchment. It was a sanguine illustration of the very tree I was standing in front of. A strange gibberish sentence at the bottom of the page: "Arten Mhat Bornifor Shaden Artoz." I annunciated this out loud in a whisper to myself. I need to get this thing to a historian or an archeologist stat, or anyone who could shed some light on this high strangeness. I struggled to jam the box in the backpack and zip it up, but I got it in there. I stood up with the back pack on and tried to head out. Keyword TRIED. I've never experienced vertigo before. Every direction I moved, I felt like I was going to fall over. If I just lie face down on the ground maybe the earth will stop spinning? The demonic wind chimes ringing out again at an even lower pitch. Panic sets in.

I heard a dog barking. It sounded big.. Then the barking sound time stretched as if someone were playing a recording of it at half speed. It was too much, and i began vomiting until there were just empty heaves. The puking seemed to stop the dizziness temporarily and I got to my feet. Then I hear a text message ding. It came from a phone number that made no sense. like 17 random numbers. The message was just one video file. I click on it KNOWING I'm not going to like what I see. Of course it's a video of this tree taken from the exact position I'm standing in, barely in color. A man walks into the frame with a wooden ladder. He looks familiar but he's wearing year 1780 garb. The camera zooms into the mans face and I drop my phone out of paralyzing terror that can't be put into words.

The man was ME. I hesitantly pick the phone off the ground with trembling hands. The "ME" in the video stares into the camera with a soulless face and positions his ladder underneath the left branch. There's no chimes on this tree though.. Instead of chimes, there was a noose wrapped around the branch. The "me" flashes a sinister smile into the camera, then slowly climbs up the ladder, maintaining eye contact the entire time. He reaches the noose, sinches it to his neck and kicks the ladder out. There's no struggle, still staring dead into the camera, the sinister grin turned into a full Cheshire cat smile, an impossibly wide smile. He opens his mouth in an O shape and a thick onyx colored liquid pours out of his mouth and his eye sockets like a faucet. End of video.

I ran faster than Hussein Bolt towards the direction I had come from initially, but as soon as I hit the perimeter of the headstone circle I'm hit with the incapacitating vertigo again. And every subsequent attempt more painful and paralyzing than the last. I physically CAN NOT get out of this circle or away from the tree. My heart is beating out of my chest, adrenaline pumping and surging. I never believed in the paranormal, or demons, ghosts.. or any bullshit like that. But now I'm unequivocally confronted  with the reality of it. I start screaming for help. Even though I have bars on my phone I can't connect to 911, or any of my contacts. The internet works but I can't email the police for help. It's like someone was toying with me, watching me panic. Giving me a little bit of hope and then taking it away.

Daylight was hanging on by a bare thread. My voice barely functioning due to the endless screaming. I want to cry but I can't. I'm lying by the tree in the fetal position shaking. This is what going into shock feels like. What soldiers in a foxhole feel as endless waves of bullets whiz and grenades explode inches from their heads. Your brain just freezes and you can't function. My phone rings.. Another nonsensical number. I thumb the slider to accept the call but I can't speak.

"James! Listen to me carefully! Can you hear me!?" It was my grandfather.. Which would have been the most welcome call in the world had he not died 6 years ago.



"Grandpa!?" I shouted both relieved and horrified. 

"I don't have much time. You need to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ before it's too late and it closes." He said.

The call was going in and out. I could only hear fragments of what he was trying to tell me.

 "It's not what you think! \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ between\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ a paradox!" the\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" realms exist in parallel and\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_." My dead grandfather was pleading something to me incomprehensibly.

"Grandpa you're breaking up, I can barely hear you!! Help me please!!" I cried.

"The incantation\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ conjunction with the head stones. Ouroboros of life, tree of death. Can you hear me James!? it\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Hurry!"

Now the tears were flowing, my voice trembling, vocal chords shot. He was trying to tell me how to escape this, but there's no way I can decipher it because I'm only getting 30 percent of his instructions.

"Grandpa I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!" I uttered sobbing.

"\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_summoned\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is interfering." Do not fear James. I'll be by your side no matter what happens. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ attempt again later but may not be successful. Don't \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  but what you feel you must do. Whatever happens.. It won't be the end. Then I heard the 3 beeps of a dropped call. 

It's six pm now. Pitch black. I thought maybe I could get lucky by attempting some of the vague things I managed to hear from my dead grandfather. I tried re-burying the box back where I'd dug it up. Nope, can't leave. I tried reciting the alien sentence on the last page (assuming that was the "incantation") in front of the tree, in front of each of the 30 headstones that comprised the circle. Nope, can't leave. Looked up all the lore about Spider Gates on the internet praying I could glean some info that could help me get the fuck out of here, but there was nothing about a box or bizarre occult scrolls. The tree is mentioned though, quite a bit. It's nicknamed "the hanging tree" well at least THAT is spot on.. Apparently several people through out history hung themselves from it. Most recently in the 50's or early 60's.

Oh and almost forgot.. During my headstone spell casting attempts, I faced the back of the tree at one point. And wouldn't you know.. There's an old rickety ten foot wooden ladder splattered with black stains leaning against this piece of shit tree. I rifled through the backpack hoping I'd find a stale snickers bar or trail mix.. OR! A lighter/matches so I could burn this fucking tree down as a big middle finger to whatever force was trapping me here. Sadly, no food and no flame. But, at very bottom of the backpack a decent length of bungee type cord.. Perfect for a makeshift noose.

I can't email anyone I know, or call/contact anybody that could actually help me. Oddly enough I can post to Reddit. If you're reading this and live in the Leicester or Worcester area please come to Spider Gates and help me. I say this kind of halfheartedly, because deep down I know If you do come, I won't be here.. Even though I AM HERE. I'm eventually going to either slowly freeze to death, starve to death, or probably a combination of both.. 

The ultra slow dog bark is back again and this time it's not stopping. and the hellish chimes blaring despite there being no wind. It's 8:05 pm and I don't know how much more I can take. I've spent the last half hour begging a God I didn't think existed to have my grandfather call me again. The hope that he might soon is the only thing keeping me from making a very, very hard decision.
