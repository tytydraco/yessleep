I was just 10 when my family decided to move, i wasn't very happy about but i was a little kid what could i do. I remember that we drove for hours into the dark deep forest and then we arrived. We had arrived in a not quite friendly and welcoming neighborhood. The people there didn't give us anything to welcome us. Anyway we continued our unpacking and we went in the house. The house was big, two stories and in my room i had a nice view of the neighborhood. Along with the neighborhood there was an abandoned house that was across our house and i had a clear view of it because it was to the other side of the street. I was curious to see what's inside and the other night when no one was looking i went there but when i was ready to go in an old man came out of nowhere and told me that i can't go in there. I was confused and i asked why. His words made my body to feel goosebumps. He said:
 
' If your willing to take a risk and see the devil for yourself then go but if you go you will never turn back'. 

I thought that it was all a joke and i was more than sure that this old man was insane and i ignored him. But as i stepped in the front yard chills were running through my spine. I hesitated and I ran back to the house. My mom was cleaning and my dad was to work. She told me that i would start school first thing in the morning tomorrow. Then i couldn't see, like someone put a blindfold to my head put i couldn't feel anything touching me, then i fainted. My mom brought me to the hospital and i remember as they were carrying me to the ambulance i saw the old man standing in front of the house and he had something on his face like a mark that he didn't have before. That was strange. Why would he sit in front of that house, was it his or he was protecting it and why did he had that mark on his face. I couldn't understand much. After i woke up to the hospital and my mom and dad was above me so worried that i wasn't going to be ok. I faint a lot but this time i had hit my head to the table. It wasn't that bad but my parents were concerned about me. 

In the morning my mom woke me up and told me to get ready for school. I wasn't even sad about it i was more curious about the house and the old man. I made a couple friends but i found a kid that was from my neighbourhood and he told me that in that house there was a family that the father of the family believed in the devil. When the other members of the family they burned the father in the basement when he was unconscious. Of course i didn't believe him at first but then he said that there's a legend of an old man protecting this house and they believe that he's the father that was burned. Then it hit me, the old man in front of the house. How is that possible i asked myself. I kept quiet and didn't say anything to my parents or my friend. 

I couldn't sleep that night, the memory of the burner face of the old man kept coming into my mind. Until i looked outside of the window. The house was creepier at night and i looked to the top window. There was something or someone moving but i couldn't see much in the dark. I immediately grabbed my father's flash light and shined at the top window. I still remember that face, that body. The body had burn marks and it didn't have a face. I ran to my bed and under the covers. I tried to sleep and get rid of what i saw from my memory, but i couldn't do it. I didn't sleep that night and when the sun was rising i closed my eyes and barely took a nap. My mom walked in the room and woke me up, like i was sleeping at all. She noticed how tired i was and she asked me what happened. I just told her that my head was hurting and i saw a nightmare. She believed me and called the school to tell them that i would go that day. Then she made a cup of tea and gave it to me. Then the doorbell rang. It was my friend who heard what happened to me and came to see if i was ok. My mom let him come to my room and left. Then i jumped out of bed and went to the window. My friend was confused and she asked me what i was doing and if i was really sick.

 I told him everything, about the old man with the burned face and the faceless man with burned marks all over his body. His jaw dropped to the floor when i told him all those things. He was right from the start. We discussed what happened the other night for hours till it was dark outside. My mom went into the room and told my friend to go home cause it was getting late. I asked my mom if my friend could stay here tonight. My mom sighed. She said that she would call his parents and if they agree he could. I hoped his parents would agree so he could see what i saw the other night. My mom walked in the room again and she said that his parents agreed but if only if him and i kept quiet throughout the night or he would never stayed here again. We agreed and went to bed. When my mom went to bed, we went to the window and watched the house all night. Until it was 2:45am when we saw it, it was at the exact room. We were so terrified when we saw it no eyes, no mouth, nothing on his face only burned marks. On the body too. Until my mom entered the room. She asked us what were we doing. We told her we were just looking at the sky full of stars. She believed us but she said we have to go to bed now because we have school in the morning. 

Anyway, we had already seen what we wanted so we did have a choice than to go to sleep. In the morning my mom woke us up and we continued our day like nothing happened, like we didn't see anything. As i was going home from school i stopped in front of the house and took a good look at it.
