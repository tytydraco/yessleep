The chill of the night air sent shivers down my spine as I laced up my running shoes, preparing for my usual night run. The dim glow of the streetlights flickered outside my window, casting long shadows that danced across the room. My phone buzzed on the nightstand, interrupting my thoughts. I picked it up, and my heart skipped a beat as I read the notification: "URGENT: Serial killer still on the loose. Third body recovered while police is hunting for evidence. We advise you to stay indoors and avoid isolated locations"  
  
My hands trembled as I scrolled through the details. The news sent a surge of adrenaline through my veins, turning my excitement for the night run into fear.  
  
I glanced at myself in the mirror, my reflection distorted by the anxiety coursing through me. In a state of panic, I fumbled to choose my outfit. I needed to blend in, to become invisible to the eyes. I opted for dark, inconspicuous clothing, thinking it would camouflage me in the night.  
  
My hands shook as I tightened my ponytail, my mind racing with thoughts of the potential danger that loomed outside my door. I hesitated for a moment, my eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape route. The streetlights outside flickered again, casting eerie shadows that seemed to come alive.My night jogging was the norm and I didn't want to change that.  
  
In the dimly lit hallway, I paused, my breath catching in my throat. The silence that enveloped the house was suffocating, broken only by the distant hum of the refrigerator. Every creak of the floorboards sent chills down my spine, echoing the unease building within me.  
  
As I stepped out into the night, the cool breeze brushed against my face, and I quickened my pace. I started on my normal path in the woods which usually was deserted by the time I was out apart from the random fellow runner or homeless people but lately they also seemed to avoid the area which was concerning.  
  
I checked my phone compulsively, the screen illuminating my anxious face. The notification continued to taunt me, each word heightening my fear.   
  
Half way through I started hearing footsteps close by and my heart pace picked up. I could not determine how far the other person was but the distance between us was closing. My breathing got faster and faster as I tried to pinpoint the location of the stranger. I strayed from my path and got further into the woods trying to stay undetected.  
  
"I really need to stop doing this", I muttered to myself as I was still looking around in the dark trying to guess which shadow belonged to the trees and which to him.  
  
And then, as if emerging from the shadows themselves, a figure materialized beside me. The world slowed as I turned to face them, my breath catching in my throat.   
  
Barely a whisper managed to escape my lips before the screaming started. I was able to escape the struggle with minimum scratches and small amount of bleeding. Nothing I couldn't hide with a couple bandages and loose clothing.  
  
I ran as fast as I my legs could carry me but still it took me more than an hour to get home. I got through my door breathless while the sun started rising.  
Trembling I got in the shower to wash away the night's events. The hot water doing wonders to my bruised body and soul.  
  
It took me a couple of hours to calm myself but the illusion of peace shattered once the second notification came in "4th body recovered.  Forensics have uncovered DNA at the scene. Investigation continues"  
  
It was time to take a break.
