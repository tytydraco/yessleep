It was a dark and stormy night, and I was home alone in my apartment. I had always been a bit of a night owl, and I enjoyed the peaceful solitude that came with the late hours.

But tonight, something was different. As I sat at my desk, trying to focus on my work, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I kept glancing over my shoulder, expecting to see someone standing behind me, but there was no one there.

The feeling of being watched only grew stronger as the night went on. It was as if an unseen presence was lurking in every corner of the room, just beyond my field of vision.

I tried to rationalize it away, telling myself that it was just the wind or the creaking of the old building. But deep down, I knew that something was wrong. 

The darkness seemed to pulsate with an otherworldly energy, and I could feel the weight of the presence bearing down on me. I could barely bring myself to move, let alone focus on my work.

I tried to ignore it, but the presence only grew stronger. It was as if it was feeding off of my fear and desperation.

I knew I had to do something, but I was too afraid to confront it. In the end, it was the presence that made the first move.

I woke up to find myself lying on the floor, my whole body trembling with fear. The presence was gone, but the memory of it would haunt me for the rest of my days.

I never stayed home alone at night again, and I always made sure to keep the lights on. I didn't know what the presence was, or why it had chosen me, but I knew that I never wanted to experience it again.

But as the days went on, the presence only grew stronger. It seemed to be everywhere I went, a shadowy figure lurking just out of sight.

I tried to ignore it, but it was impossible. The presence seemed to be toying with me, always just beyond my reach.

I knew I had to do something, but I didn't know where to turn. I was alone, with no one to help me.

And then, one night, the presence revealed itself. It was a creature, a monster unlike anything I had ever seen. Its eyes glowed with a malevolent light, and its skin was slick and slimy.

I ran, but I knew it was too late. The creature had found me, and it would never let me go.

I don't know how long I ran, but eventually I collapsed, my body too weak to go on. The creature loomed over me, its breath hot on my face.

And then, just as it was about to strikeâ€¦everything went back to normal 

But even now, as I sit here in the safety of my bed, I can still feel the presence lurking in the darkness, waiting to claim me....
