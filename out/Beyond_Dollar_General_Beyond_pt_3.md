I met Agent Cash in the place where all clandestine meetings are held, the back row of the local Burger King.  
  
He was sitting in the back next to the ancient but well-loved play place, and that was likely by design. No one would be able to hear us over the racket the kids were making, less chance of people eavesdropping. The closer I got to him, the more I had to remind myself why I was doing this. I think I would have rather kept suffering the Miasma in my house than meet with Agent Cash again, but what choice did I have?  
  
We needed to know where the Miasma had taken Celene, and he knew how to find that kind of information.  
  
"I must say," he said, his fingers locked before him on the chipped Formica table, "I was surprised to hear from you so soon. I know you and your friends aren't out of money, so I don't suppose this is an attempt to extort us."  
He was smiling, but I wasn't in the mood for jokes.  
  
"Would you like to tell me why the miasma took one of my friends yesterday?"  
Whatever he had been expecting, that wasn't it.  
  
"What?"  
  
"Yeah, they've been attacking my house for close to a week. My whole house is all but nocturnal at this point, and now someone has been taken by someone from your side. This kind of thing really doesn't make me want to stay quiet about what you have going on behind closed bathroom doors."  
  
Cash rolled his eyes, "Because you've been SO quiet about it. Do you think we haven't read your little story? If anyone took your little story online seriously, we'd have already made you disappear, and your little dog too."  
I wanted to laugh at his reference, but I wasn't in the mood.  
  
"A. I started that before I had even met you and B. That is not the point. You still haven't explained why your creatures took my friend."  
  
"I haven't the foggiest," he said, "If the miasma took someone, it wasn't on my order."  
  
I had expected him to lay out some kind of grand plan or make threats and ultimatums, but the knowledge that he wasn't involved in this was scarier by far.  
  
"But," I tried to put together something cohesive and mostly failed, "Aren't you, like, the leader here? Your shadowy organization is at the head of this kind of thing."  
  
He shrugged, "I don't know what to tell you, kid. We run operations on this side, but I'm not the King of the Dollar General Beyond. The miasma do what they want sometimes, but this is disturbing."  
  
He reached for his drink and it took everything I had not to slap it out of his hand.  
  
"Why is that?"  
  
"Because, until you just told me, we were unaware that they could interact with things outside the stores. They've never done it before, at least as far as we know, and it shouldn't be possible."  
  
"Why's that?"  
  
He glanced around, the kids in the play place really exercising their lungs as they ran amok, before leaning in closer than I strictly wanted him.  
  
"Look, the stores aren't entirely natural. The organization, the one that tracks the Dollar Generals, isn't the one that builds them. Hell, we don't even know about them sometimes until some shlub calls to see if we're hiring for a new location. Then we put a pin in a map and open a new store."  
  
I sat back a little, trying to wrap my head around this.  
  
"Then...how do they get built?"  
  
He smiled, "You ever notice that sometimes there are multiple Dollar Generals within blocks of each other? You drive into town and think "Oh look, a new Dollar General. But they sure put that up quick." Well, WE didn't. They just appear. No one builds them, no one contracts them, and a big chunk of our revenue each year goes to fines for not securing permits for these stores. We pay off individuals sometimes, sometimes we show doctored paperwork saying we had contracts and permits, but it's all bullshit. I'll tell you something else, too," he said, taking a long sip of whatever was in the cup before continuing, "For every store that pops up, another store appears in the Beyond too. I don't know if it's a matter of which came first, the Beyond or the Store, but when we investigate the new store's connection, there's always a counterpart in the Beyond."  
  
This was a lot to process, and I was glad I hadn't bought food before sitting down with him.  
  
"What's to stop them from just popping up everywhere?"  
  
He smiled at me, and the effect was chilling, "Not a damn thing. Perhaps one day the Dollar Generals will conquer the earth, just a world of stores as far as the eye can see. It would be terrifying if it wasn't so intriguing."  
  
I was getting sidetracked and I knew it, "So how do we get my friend back?"  
He looked at me over the top of his lid, the cup making a slurping sound as he emptied it, "You don't," he said as if it should be obvious.  
  
I exhaled, "That's not an option. We have to get her back."  
  
Cash scoffed, the ice rattling as he put the cup down, "You are one of the only escapees from the Dollar General Beyond. Are you in that much of a hurry to go back?"  
  
"If that's what I have to do," I answered without hesitation.  
  
Cash just rolled his eyes, "It's not like there's a surefire way to get there."  
He said it, but I wasn't entirely sure I believed him. I can't prove it, but I had a theory that beneath that unconvincing skinsuit was something similar to what had grabbed Celene. He may not be king of the miasma, but he was one of them, and he had to have a way to take shore leave sometimes. I hadn't really expected him to just hand us the keys and let us head to the other side, but I had hoped he would let more slip than that.  
  
"Well, I need my friend back, and you're the only person I know who knows about the Beyond, besides Gale and I."  
  
Cash shrugged, "That sounds like a you problem. I only agreed to meet with you because my supervisors were afraid you were getting ready to do something stupid. If you go and get yourself back into the Beyond, don't expect another check if you make it back out again. We don't pay people to go sightseeing. Well, we do, but the training to head into the Beyond and come back out makes astronauts look like Boy Scouts."  
  
He got up, as if meaning to go, but snapped his fingers again and sat back down, startling me.  
  
"Speaking of, I have been authorized to make you an offer on your travel journal by the higher-ups."  
  
I wasn't sure what he meant at first, but then I realized he was talking about the journal I had made of the various Dollar General Beyond stores. Why would they want it, I wondered? They controlled the stores, they should know them like the back of their hand. This made me think again that this side of the operation might not be as in control as I had thought.  
  
"Not a chance," I said, "I had to make that at great personal risk to myself. It's priceless."  
  
"Incorrect," Cash said, reaching into his breast pocket, "It's worth this much."  
  
He slid a piece of paper across the table with enough 0s on it to make my eyebrows go up.  
  
"Wow, well, that is a generous offer, but I still have to decline."  
  
"Suit yourself," he said, "When you need cash, let us know. It's unlikely we'll get a better one, but if we do the offer is, obviously, null and void."  
  
He left then, and I went and got food. Dark revelations or not, I was still hungry.  
  
Gale was leaning against the wall across from the closet when I got him, just staring at it in abject dejection. Buddy had his head in his lap, and Gale was petting him absentmindedly. Gale told me later that he had intentions of...uh unaliving himself while I was gone but the pupper had changed his mind. Buddy was great at so many things it seemed, and really was a good boy.  
  
"Did that grinning imp have anything to say?" he asked, never looking up from Buddy's coat.  
  
"Just that he wasn't going to let us in, and he wasn't going to go get her for us."  
  
"Pretty much what I expected," Gale said.  
  
I sat down across from him then, really looking at him as he sat there stroking the dog.  
  
"So what are we going to do?" I asked.  
  
"Somehow," Gale said, and for a moment he sounded like his old self again, "We have to get back into the Beyond."  
  
We spent the afternoon sharing knowledge. I told him what Cash had told me, and he told me what he made of it. We made plans, put aside plans, and made new plans. Ultimately, we didn't do much but keep each other company, but that seemed to be enough for that moment.  
  
I don't have a lot else to say, but I'll keep you updated.  
  
Until then, be safe out there.  
  
You never know when the Beyond might decide to reach out and grab you.
