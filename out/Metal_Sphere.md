[Part 1 - Amber Eyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gwtdqo/amber_eyes/)

“You have visitors!” Helen exclaimed as I lay somewhat comfortably in the hospital bed.

I opened my eyes and saw my team slowly walk into the room. A feeling of embarrassment and discomfort washed over me as I felt their eyes scanning my damaged body. I held my tears at bay.

“Hey buddy. So good to see you again! I hope you are feeling okay. But you look like shit!” Barry said jokingly. The others and I chuckled.

“We got you a get well soon present,” Cecilia said, placing a bottle of my favorite bourbon on the nightstand next to me. “We figured you’d need a strong drink after this.”

“You know, I would suggest you drink now, but I’m sure Helen will stop you,” Otto smiled as Helen gave him a sharp look.

“We have some good news that might cheer you up. You remember the report you made about A-” Barry stopped as he noticed Helen still in the room. “That one company that could be our biggest possible client. Because they have shitty standards. Well, we have them as a client thanks to you! That’s right, people, we are back in the game! All thanks to this fucker right here!”

As Barry reassured me that my position was safe and the company would cover both my expenses and medical leave, I couldn't help but notice the space behind Otto. The air seemed to ripple, like the mirage you see on a hot road in the summer.

Suddenly, a tiny, shiny object fell from it. I heard no sound or indication of this thing hitting the ground. The dancing air vanished immediately afterwards.

“Hey buddy. You okay?” Barry inquired.

“Yeah. Just distracted,” I said, my gaze interrupted. “Must be my mind playing tricks on me. Is there a heater behind you, Otto? Maybe I saw a mirage or a gas leak or something.”

“Those drugs must be strong, eh?” Otto remarked as he searched for a heater behind him. “No heater he-”

Suddenly, everything went pitch black and dead silent. The only thing I could see was the window, displaying the starry night sky. I couldn’t see anyone from my team, nor the nurse, nor any of the hospital devices in my room.

“Hello? Barry? Otto? Cecilia? Helen?” I called out. All I could hear was the empty space echoing my voice back at me. “Anyone?”

I was still too weak to sit or stand. Only my arms were available to examine my surroundings. They were met with emptiness as I tried to feel around on either side of my bed.

Then I felt the bed. It was warm to the touch but rigid. I flicked it and heard a metallic ping in response. Panic started to seep in; my hospital bed was supposed to be a hard, springy mattress with a fabric cover. Even the pillow under my head had disappeared.

Using my hands to examine my body, I noticed they didn't encounter any fabric or cloth. Just skin. I checked the IV on my right arm. Only skin. Finally, I felt my face, only to find the same result. Skin. I was naked, vulnerable, and afraid in this vast, unnatural darkness.

A few minutes later, I heard a constant high-frequency sound, like a mosquito. It was faint at first, but it gradually grew louder, as if the source was getting closer.

Suddenly, my arms twitched and spasmed. There was no pain, but I couldn't control them.

When the spasms stopped, my arms seized metal bars hidden in the pitch black on either side of me. I couldn't get my arms to let go. I tried using my legs to break free, but it was futile.

I stopped struggling as I realized the buzzing sound was right in front of me. It was a mere inch from my exposed nose—a shiny, metallic, tiny sphere hovering motionlessly. All I could do was stay still and stare at it, fighting the urge to scream.

After a few seconds, it ascended about a foot above my nose, as if to get my attention. Then, it slowly descended, inching its way back towards me.

I shook my head violently, desperate to avoid its probing. But it was futile; it mirrored my every movement with eerie precision.

As it entered my left nostril, it paused momentarily. Suddenly, a high-pitched sound, reminiscent of a dentist's drill, pierced the silence.

I closed my eyes, trembling, awaiting my fate.

However, I felt no pain.

I opened my eyes and found myself back in my apartment.

“Was it all a dream?” I said to myself. I ran to the bathroom mirror and examined my nose. It appeared to be in perfect health. No stitches. No bandages. No discomfort as I touched it.

I was wildly ecstatic. That dream felt so real, and I am glad that nightmare is over.

My alarm clock showed 6:14 AM. As I turned and took a step towards my closet to prepare for the day, I found myself unable to move. My arms fell limp at my sides, completely against my will. Then, my body slowly turned towards the mirror, my eyes locking onto what felt like my very soul.

My sheer willpower could not control my legs, my arms, my head. Even my own breathing was out of reach. I was trapped inside my own body, and I couldn’t do a damn thing about it.

Then, it smirked at me. My own body smirked at me.

I watched as it dressed in my typical work clothes: the dark blue long sleeves and black dress pants that took me hours to find at the mall, and the worn-out brown formal shoes I bought on sale during Boxing Day a couple of years ago.

I couldn’t feel the clothes it was touching, nor their smell. As it ate my cereal and milk for breakfast, none of the sweetness reached me. I couldn’t even control the movement of my eyes.

All I could do was watch and listen, trapped in a relentless cycle of torment. This malevolent force had taken over my body, my life, and all I could do was bear witness. It reveled in my suffering, forcing me to observe as it dismantled my existence piece by piece. Every joy and sorrow that awaited me in the future was now stolen, replaced by a void of despair. It thrived on my helplessness, feeding off my agony. I was powerless, a mere spectator to my own demise. I didn't know what I had done to deserve this fate, but here I was, plunged into a personal hell.

As it arrived at my workplace, I could perceive everyone acknowledge it.

“Welcome back! You look splendid!” exclaimed Barry. “I can’t believe the hospital discharged you only two weeks after your horrible freak accident.”

“I am a fast healer,” it replied. “Shall we have a meeting? I want to continue where I left off.”

I screamed internally, knowing that no one could hear me. My colleagues smiled and nodded, oblivious to the horror that had taken my place. I was trapped, a prisoner in my own body, watching helplessly as it lived my life.
