*Hello, we recently received a request for the date of your death. If you are still interested in this information, please respond back with “YES”.*  
  
Startled awake, I sat up in bed, rubbing my eyes. The soft ping from my phone had disturbed my slumber. Expecting a mundane message, I was taken aback by the strange content. I skeptically read the words again, smirking in disbelief. Spammers nowadays are crossing all boundaries. The date of my death? What kind of nonsense is this? Placing the phone on my lap, I dismissed it as another nuisance. Who on earth was deathdate @ xmail. com anyway? I hesitated for a moment, a small part of me curious about the response I would receive if I replied with a "YES." Shaking my head, I dismissed the thought, deleted the message, and returned to my attempt at falling back asleep.  
  
**Ping.**  
  
Turning back over, the glaring light from my phone screen caught my attention. What now? I entered my passcode and almost dropped the phone in surprise when I saw it was yet another text from deathdate @ xmail. com.

**Message deleted.**  
  
This was getting annoying. Do spammers never rest? Irritated, I tossed my phone back onto the nightstand, but before I could lay my head back on the pillow, it pinged again. Letting out a frustrated groan, I begrudgingly grabbed the phone, only to discover it was from THE SAME SCAMMER.  
  
**Message received on June 1, 2023 at 12:57 AM.**  
*Hello, the request for your-*  
  
Without bothering to read further, I hovered my finger over the delete and block buttons. But before I could take action, my phone pinged again, and this time, it churned my stomach.  
  
**Message received on June 1, 2023 at 12:57 AM.**  
*I wouldn't do that if I were you... Please respond with "YES."*  
  
Anger and confusion surged through me. It was almost 1 o'clock in the morning, and I had to wake up for work in a few hours. This was the last thing I wanted to deal with. I had a hundred and one things I needed to take care of, and this was not one of them. In a state of sleep-deprived anger, I decided to respond.  
  
**Message received on June 1, 2023 at 12:58 AM.**  
*Listen, I don't know who you are or what sick game you're playing, but I'm not freaking interested!*  
  
**Message received on June 1, 2023 at 12:59 AM.**  
*Please respond with "YES."*  
  
**Sender blocked. You will no longer receive any messages from this number.**  
  
Slamming my phone down on the nightstand, I rolled over and finally managed to fall asleep. When I woke up in the morning, the blinking notification light on my phone caught my attention. Tapping the screen, I saw a text message, and when I realized who it was from, I nearly lost it.  
  
**Message received on June 2, 2023 at 3:00 AM.**  
*Hello, the request for your death date is still available. If you're still interested, please respond with "YES."*  
  
**Message received on June 2, 2023 at 6:35 AM.**  
*NO.*  
  
This was seriously getting on my nerves. I could have sworn I blocked this lunatic last night.  
  
**Ping.**  
  
**Message received on June 2, 2023 at 6:36 AM.**  
*Thank you for your response. Your suspected date of death is scheduled for JUNE 2, 2023.*  
  
My phone slipped from my trembling hands and fell to the floor. What the actual...  
  
**Ping.**  
  
With shaky hands, I reached down to retrieve my phone and braced myself for the worst.  
  
**Message received on June 2, 2023 at 6:37 AM.**  
*Hey Honey! This is your mother! It's been so long since you've texted me that I thought you might have forgotten who I was, haha! Hope you're doing well! Give me a call later today when you find some time. I've been getting some strange text messages.*  
  
Sweat beaded on my brow as I read the last sentence of her text over and over again. 'I've been getting some strange text messages?' Not my mom... anyone but her. I quickly typed a response.  
  
**Message received on June 2, 2023 at 6:40 AM.**  
*Hey Mom! I'm so sorry I haven't been in touch as much as I should. What kind of strange texts have you been receiving?*  
  
I watched the typing bubbles appear and disappear, my anxiety building with each passing moment. I hoped and prayed that whatever she received was just some bizarre text from Amazon or a fake warning about her Facebook account.  
  
**Message received on June 2, 2023 at 6:42 AM.**  
*It's okay, sweetie! I'm just glad to hear from you! I think it's just spam. I'm going to delete it!*  
  
**Message received on June 2, 2023 at 6:42 AM.**  
*No! Don't delete it! Tell me what it says first.*  
  
**Message received on June 2, 2023 at 6:44 AM.**  
*Oh, don't worry about it! I'm sure it's nothing.*  
  
**Message received on June 2, 2023 at 6:44 AM.**  
*Mom, please just tell me what it says?*  
  
**Message received on June 2, 2023 at 6:47 AM.**  
*Are you okay?? It's just a silly spam message about some weight loss pills.*  
  
Relief washed over me. I had never been so relieved to hear about some maniac trying to sell my mom pills. I know how that sounds… Just don’t read into it.  
  
**Message received on June 2, 2023 at 6:48 AM.**  
*I'm okay!! I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something else!*  
  
Slumping down onto the floor, I clicked on the message from my spammer and read it again.  
  
*Thank you for your response. Your suspected date of death is scheduled for JUNE 2, 2023.*  
  
Surely this was just some sick prank... As I showered and got dressed for the day, I hurriedly got into my car, hoping to make up for lost time.  
  
7:55 AM glared at me from my car's dashboard. Suddenly, the radio flickered to life, emitting static that filled the car. Trying to concentrate on the road while attempting to turn down the volume proved to be a challenge. Traffic was already bad, and the blaring static only added to the chaos. My hands scrambled to silence the noise, but nothing seemed to work. And then, I heard it... A whisper amidst the static. I thought I was imagining things until it repeated.  
  
*"Your time is up."*  
  
Just then, a semi-truck raced through the intersection. There was no time to stop, so I accelerated, narrowly escaping a collision. Adrenaline and fear coursed through me as I pulled over to the side of the road. My hands were clammy, clutching the steering wheel so tightly that my knuckles turned white. The radio had gone silent at some point, and now the car was enveloped in an eerie stillness. And that's when I heard it...  
  
**Ping.**  
  
**Message received on June 2, 2023 at 8:02 AM.**  
*Hello, we are reaching out to notify you that due to unforeseen circumstances, your death date has been rescheduled for JUNE 3, 2023.*  
  
A mixture of relief and overwhelming nausea surged within me. Opening the car door, I stumbled out and retched, emptying the contents of my stomach. When I finally finished, I heard another ping from my phone. My stomach churned violently, and tears welled up in my eyes. I turned to grab my phone, unlocked it, and glanced at the message.  
  
**Message received on June 2, 2023 at 8:07 AM.**  
*Hello, it has come to our attention that the unforeseen circumstance preventing your death was none other than yourself. Please note that you cannot outrun the inevitable, and as a consequence for this action, your death date has been rescheduled for June 2, 2023 at 8:0-*  
  
Blinding light seared my eyes, and a loud beeping echoed around me as I slowly returned to reality. A blurry figure sat beside my bed, and after focusing for a while, I recognized it as my mother, fast asleep in a chair.  
  
"Mom?" I croaked, my voice hoarse. My throat felt dry and scratchy, and my body throbbed with pain.  
  
I winced and tried calling out to her again, but my voice was nothing more than a whisper. Seizing the opportunity, I surveyed my surroundings. It was evident that I had been unconscious for a while. Cards and flowers adorned my hospital room. A small calendar hung in the corner, and I strained my eyes to read the date.  
  
**June 16, 2023.**  
  
Closing my eyes, relief washed over me as I realized that once again, I had cheated death.  
  
**Ping.**  
  
My eyes darted to the nightstand. My phone was nowhere to be found, but my mother's phone glowed with a new message. With trembling hands, I reached out and picked it up, dreading the words that awaited me.
