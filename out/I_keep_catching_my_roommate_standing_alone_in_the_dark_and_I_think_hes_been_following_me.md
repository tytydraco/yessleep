 Me and my roommate have known each other for a couple years now. We met through my financial advisor in college, as I really needed a new place to live and she knew of another guy who attended school as well and needed a place to live. I met Sam at a coffee shop one day and we got along pretty well. We had enough similarities and decided to give it a shot. The first two years were great, we got along well and had different friend groups. We both did our jobs to keep the place clean and paid up, and gave each other enough space to never butt heads. Sam was alright. That is, until one day we had a rather big argument as he accused me of sneaking into his room at night. He claimed that he caught me walking around his room going through his things, leaving out of the window once I was caught. I was dumbfounded at this accusation, and had just assumed something happened in his life and he wanted out of the house.

 The next day when I got back home, I was fully prepared to have to explain to the landlord what had happened with Sam, hoping he could maybe help find me a new roommate. As I walked through the front door into the front room, I noticed something was different. Both the place, and Sam. I couldn’t quite place it, it was as if everything was moved slightly to the left or rotated just a degree or two. The place smelled funny, like new shoes, and Sam was waiting with his hands behind his back, smiling wide with a slight tilt to his head. He didn’t look normal, his eyes seemed wider, mouth longer. Sam apologized for the previous fight, and was adamant to tell me that his phone was stolen and he believes they had a break in. Sam almost commands me to block the old number, and to start using his new number which he provided. Sam didn’t sound normal either, he sounded like he had just drank ice cold water. Whatever the case, I didn’t have to find a new roommate so all was well. 

 He would stay away more than usual, something I would notice was he never seemed to change clothes, either. About a month ago, I woke up to strange noises from in the living room. When I went to investigate, I found Sam standing in the middle of the room, in complete darkness. Thinking he was sleep walking, I didn’t want to disturb him so I slowly crept away, back to my bed. Almost finding it funny, I turned on my side to let the night take me away when I heard Sam returning to his bed, slowly creeping down the hall, but as he walked past my room he looked right at me, with that wide smile, eyes piercing mine. This sent a jolt down my spine, and I quickly shut and locked the door. I tried not to come out at night anymore after that as he stood like this in almost every room in the house after mid night, making weird clicking noises as he stood in the black abyss. 

 One day as I was running errands, I swore I saw Sam on multiple occasions, but when I got home he was deep into cooking food, happy as ever to see me. I began to notice his features change even more over time; his eyes seemed to get deeper and bigger, mouth wider, and his build got taller and skinnier, and hair thinner and stiff like wire. He would stand in random rooms of the house every single night, making his clicking noises, and I would continue to think I saw him following me in public. I finally decided to find a new place to live, but I had to stay put for 3 months until the lease was up. When I told Sam that I wouldn’t be renewing my end of the lease, his face grew long and cold. Saddened by this news, he did not ask any questions, just started making clicking noises staring down at the floor. He then sparked up and attempted to go to his room when I confronted him about following me around town. Sam smiled, and told me I wasn’t going anywhere. Sam lunged towards me, a knife suddenly in hand. He got me right in the shoulder, but I was able to fight him off which sent the knife flying away. Sam ran off, as I called 911. 

 At the hospital, I had received news that would shake me to the core. When asked who attacked me, I told them what had been going on the past couple months, to which the police said they would get back to me. The very next day, I found out the horrible truth. Sam, my ex roommate, had moved out the very next day we got into our fight. Sam had moved 4 states away, having a job that would corroborate this, meaning Sam was not the one I had been living with this past couple months. Who the hell has taken the form of Sam, and decided they wanted to torment me? The real Sam had told police that he received a text from me stating that he was kicking him out, that he would murder him and his entire family if he even tried to call the police. This scared him, enough to make the real Sam not come asking questions. The real Sam stated that not only his belongings, but every single item in the house was brought to the curb when he came to grab his stuff. He mentioned that I approached him and looked severely disheveled, almost morphed, commanding him to block my number and to never contact him again. 

 The next night I stayed in the hospital, I could see him standing in the parking lot. Still using Sam’s face, still stalking me. That moment I realized it was either me or him. No one was going to help me, they all thought I was crazy now. In order to leave the hospital, I had to talk to a shrink. As I waited to speak to this person, I saw a lady sitting alone waiting in the corner of the waiting room, and she perked up when she caught my sight. She told me she over heard my story passing by in the hallway earlier, and she assured me I was not crazy. She claimed that the same thing happened to her a few years ago, and that even though she killed the monster stalking her, it still haunted her. She told me about how her sister had come home one day different, much like Sam. She claimed that she tried to help her sister, but this thing was not who she had thought, and ultimately she was forced to kill the creature. She told me that she still saw her twisted face every now and then, and that’s what keeps bringing her back there. Her name was Annie, and she told me I had to cut out the heart completely to kill the creatures, it was the only way, but to not return home to it. I needed to find him in public, but how would I do that?

 I was then called in to speak with the shrink, and I decided to be honest with him. When leaving the shrinks office, the girl was gone. I stayed for a couple more days at the hospital, as they suspected I may be suicidal. Each night I would see a figure standing in the parking lot, and one time I swore I saw Sam walking by my door just like that night he had been ‘sleep walking’. But eventually I was deemed safe to be released, and with nowhere else to go I went back home to grab my things, remembering Annies words but I had assumed there was no way Sam would be there, but once again I was wrong. As I entered my home, I began to smell a very strong chemical smell, and to my surprise, I saw Sam there. Though not the real Sam, the monster hiding in Sam’s image. He welcomed me home, and offered to provide me with answers. I didn’t want to hear anything that cold deep voice was spouting, but I was very curious what hell this thing was, and what it wanted. But would I even be able to believe it? No. This is exactly where he wanted me, and with this sharp intrusion of a realization I decided to make a run for the back door. 

 Sam did not chase after, he just smiled watching me race for the door. I gripped the handle and paced through, only to walk right through the front door of my house, into the front room. What? I didn’t know what the hell just happened, so I turned right around and ran out the front door, only to now be coming in through the back door. I was trapped. Sam began to stretch out, quickly displaying sickly long arms and legs, like long branches peering off of a skinny, weathered trunk. Sam’s jaw elongated, his eyes popping out of his skull looking similar to a snails’. Sam then told me his real name; but I couldn’t pronounce it if my life depended on it. He told me to continue using Sam, as he’s grown fond of the human name. Branch like hands then shot out of the ground and held me in place, and Sam told me where he was from, and what he wanted. Sam was from an alternate plane, one that hosted many horrible evils. He told me some called it Hell, and that may be the best way to explain it. But one day he slipped through the veil, and his innate instincts told him to blend in, to become human. For centuries he would blend in, taking someones identity and being an imposter, feeding on the lies, manipulation, benefitting in ways our human minds just can’t understand.

 And so I sit here, trapped in some strange suspended version of my house, caught between a few different timelines. I know that sounds strange, but isn’t all of this? In one reality, Im still pinned to the floor with the strange branches clutching me tightly, Sam hissing and clicking in my face, feeding off my fear. In another reality I click forward to, I am sitting on my bed, typing this entire story out, hoping that it is read by someone who knows how to help me. The other two realities that I click forward into aren’t really worth mentioning, but I will anyways. Hell maybe it is relevant somehow? In one of them I’m actually a little girl. Just a small child, one who looks strikingly familiar. The last one is a timeline where this creature never found me. I am enjoying my house with a lady who seems to be my wife, and my small daughter, but we soon get a knock at the door. I stand up to get the door, but it always clicks forward to another time line reality just as the door opens, and when it becomes time to return to this reality, and resets to the beginning and I never remember the outcome until after. 

 I think I’ve found a way out of this loop, this prison that I seem to be stuck in. Someone has been knocking at the door to my room recently. I always figured it was Sam, but maybe it was something else, someone else. If you don’t hear back from me, I either lost the fight and I’m doomed, or I won and somehow lost memory of this log. To the real Sam: I hope this monster hasn’t found you like he did me, and to Annie: I hope that the hauntings have stopped for you. For now, this is goodbye.
