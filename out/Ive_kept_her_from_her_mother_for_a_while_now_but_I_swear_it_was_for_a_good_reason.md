 

Emily is special. She sees things. We’re at an empty playground in a small town that time has forgotten. She’s giggling and having fun, but she’s being more persistent than usual.

“I want to go home.”

“I know sweetie. I’ll take you home soon.”

“It’s always soon. It’s never tomorrow.” She giggles again and she goes higher. I’m deep in thought and I keep staring at the little drops of water running down the lengths of the chain on the swing next to us. It’s just now dawn, and getting closer to when we’ve got to get back on the road. I know it and so does she. I don’t know want to take her home. 

“Okay, I’m done now….Max…Max!” Her shrill little command takes a minute to pull me out of my own thoughts.

“Okay. Okay, sorry.” I slow her down and she hops off the swing into the wet sand. We can’t seem to escape the rain. It’s following us. We hold hands as we walk back to the car. She skips through the puddles. I open the door for her and she climbs in the truck. She’s only eight. This isn’t what she deserves, but it’s not what I deserve either. It serves a  purpose. We’re driving for almost an hour when she stops singing to herself and starts to cry. I don’t even ask her why  because I know what’s wrong.

“I miss my mom.”

“I know honey.”

“You said one more and we could go back.”

“I know.”

“Do you mean it this time? Because you’ve said that a bunch of times.” I don’t say anything because I don’t want to lie to her. How do I convince her that she should stay with me? I don’t want her to go. “Max?!”

“You know…it's…” God, help me find an excuse. God, I don’t want to lose her. “It’s a good thing you’re here with me.” It’s a lame thing to say and she tells me as much. We drive for a little bit more in silence before she points to a side road off the highway.

“It’s that one.” I follow her directions. There’s a lot of turns on some muddy backroads. “We’re getting close. Pull over here.”

I follow her directions and pull over. I kill the engine under some gnarled oaks. I reach under the seat and pull out my mask and my gun. I know it’s loaded and ready to go, but I check it anyway. Emily just stares at me. I give her a kiss on the forehead before I put on my mask.

“How many are there?” She doesn’t answer. She purses her lips and looks out the window. “Emily?”

“I’m not telling.”

“What?!”

“You promised. You promised me so many times.” God, not now.

“Emily, I… can we talk about this when I get back?” She turns back to me.

“You promised. I need to go home.” I hang my head. How much longer can I argue with her? “I can hear my mom every night. She prays about me every night.”

“Well you’re fine.”

“She doesn’t know that Max. You need to let me go.” After all this time, I’m about to lose her forever. I shouldn’t be occupying my mind with this right now. It could make me sloppy. Things could go bad. “There’s only one of them this time.” she says. I look back up at her. She’s trying not to cry. How much longer am I going to do this?

“Fine. After this one, I’ll take you back to your mother.”

“You promise? Not like that means anything.” I promise her and she gives me a quick summary of everything she sees in her head about this place and the thing who lives here. She stays in the truck while I trudge through the wet underbrush. I’m being too loud, but I can’t concentrate. She’s about to leave, and there is nothing I can do. I never should have taken her, but I felt like I had no choice. 

Focus Max.

It’s a ranch house in the middle of ancient mossy oaks. A couple of broken cars and a muddy driveway that circles the house. The roof is bad and the paint is chipped and faded. Lots of windows and a half rotten porch that looks like it wraps around the place. There’s a barn to the right. I look at my watch. Emily said to wait for one more minute. The rain starts in a little harder. I see him now. Skinny and tall and wearing a top hat of all things out here. He walks out of the barn back to the house. He puts his hand in his pocket. She told me to move when his back was to me and his hand was in his pocket. I try to be quiet and I hold the gun up keeping it aimed squarely between his shoulder blades.

I slip on mud just as I’m about to tell him to turn around. The gun goes off in my hand when I fall. 

It gives him just enough time to turn and pull something out of his jacket. He’s got a gun. I manage to fire two shots into his kneecaps before he can even pull his trigger. I run over and kick his gun away from him while he writhes in agony. I pat him down real quick and then I drag him to one of the rusty cars. I take a couple zip ties out of my jacket and tie him up through the window frame. He’s babbling something. They always do. I ignore him and run into the house. I find the boy in a back bedroom that’s locked. I kick the door down. He’s still alive. I call the police and give them all the details of how to get here. I tell the boy I have to go. I tell him that he’s going to go back home. He’s crying. I have to take her back home.

I always feel awful when I leave them there waiting for the police, but in the end they’re always fine. I can’t risk being caught myself. I’ve done this too many times now, and they’d lock me up and throw away the key if they knew the truth of it all.  I run back to the truck, and drive away.

I keep thinking of that boy's face. How happy he was that he’s going back home. I start to think of his parents. The peace they’re about to have. Once I’m sure we’re far enough away from the scene, I pull over. It’s time.

“Emily?” She’s singing to herself and looking out the window. I love it when she does that. I don’t want it to stop. “Emily?”

“What?”

“I’ll take you back home.” Her face lights up. She knows I mean it this time.

“Really?!”

“Unless you’ve changed your mind.”

“No! I want to see my mom!” I nod. She jumps over the seat and throws her arms around my neck. I try not to cry in front of her. I start down the highway for our last ride together. I don’t even remember what life was like before I took her with me, and I have no idea what it’s going to be like without her. I drive through the night without a single stop. After all the traveling we’ve done together, this last one was only a day away from her house. She keeps going on and on about coming home. I’m happy for her, but I admit there’s been a few times where the thought occurred to me that there was nothing she could do if I changed my mind. But I can’t. I love her too much. She saved my life. She gave me a purpose after I lost my boy.

It’s almost eight in the morning when we pull up to the old house. She’s hopping up and down on the seat.

“We’re here! I’m home.”

“Okay, okay. I want you to wait here.”

“Why?”

“Because I need to be able to say things without you staring at me. Because I really don’t want to do this. Can you just give me a minute?” She nods her head. I hug her one last time. I try to memorize everything, her face, her smell, and her voice.

“Just as long as you let her know where I am. You promised.”

“I will.” I let her go. I get out of the truck and turn back to her. “I’m not going to see anymore am I?”

“No.”

I walk up to the front door and knock. After a moment, an old woman I used to know answers the door.

“Max? Max?!” She throws her arms around me and ushers me inside. Rose gets me a cup of coffee and makes me sit down in her living room. “Oh my God! How are you?! Where did you go?” I don’t answer her question right away. I’m staring at a picture of Emily she has up on her mantlepiece. How much pain have I caused this woman? I could have given her peace a long time ago.

“Uh…I’ve been…I’ve been doing a lot of things. And I’ve been pushing off what I should have done a long time ago, because I’m a selfish man.”

“Everyone wondered what happened to you after all of it. You just up and left. Everybody thought you went crazy or something.”

“Maybe I did.”

“But you stopped that man. He might have taken more.”

“That was a while ago.”

“It’s been thirty years.”  I can’t take my eyes off the picture of Emily.

“She was a beautiful girl, Rose.” I’m trying so hard to keep it together.

“Yes she was. I just wish…”

“You wish they had been able to find her.” She nods her head and shrugs her shoulders slowly. We’ve helped so many people, Emily and I. But I couldn’t bring myself to help Rose.

“I know she’s gone. I know that man took her. I just wish I could bring her home.” 

“Rose, I have something to tell you, and if I don’t just get it out, I might never say it all.” She furrows her brow. Tears are silently building in my eyes. I have to do this. I promised Emily. I’m about to lose her.  “Rose, Emily has been with me this whole time.”

“What?” She tenses up. I don’t know if she’s going to believe this. Not at first.

“Thirty years ago, after Emily went missing…she came to me. She was standing in my kitchen. She told me about the man who killed her. She told me she could help me find him..”

“What are you talking about?” She's scared. 

“She told me exactly where he was and she told me exactly where all the bodies of the children were. She did it thirty years ago, and she’s been helping me do it ever since.”

“I think you should go.”

“Rose please. I took her from you. I could’ve given her to you thirty years ago.”

“What?”

“She’s been helping me find others. She’s been helping me find people like the one who took our children. I haven’t let her go. She’s been wanting to come home to you and I haven’t let her. I can tell you where that bad man buried her. I can take you there. She told me where she was buried thirty years ago, but I couldn’t tell you. I knew she’d leave. I was selfish. She gave me a purpose.”
