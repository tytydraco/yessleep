Blackouts, but not like before.

At my meeting I stand so fast my folding chair collapses behind me. I scream the problem is, this isn't a fucking problem. I'm waking up in my own bed. No bloat. Turds solid and curved, like a cartoon smile. No cuffs. No flashbacks that make me cringe.

Nada, not even dreams. I roll over and instead of finding an empty handle of vodka bedside, it's my phone with a dating profile I created in my sleep. A text from a date I don't remember. They want more. The way I talk to 'em, fuck 'em. Love the haircut I don't remember getting. The clothes I'd never buy. No dreams, but I'm one dreamy date! Sleepwalking? Amnesia?

  
"Won't hold up in court, my man," says eyepatch guy.

"Brain damage?" says itchy ankle monitor bozo.

Can't be. After the accident that van was a write-off. Same with the family in it. But my MRI was golden.

"Compadres," I plead, "no booze, scouts honor.”

"Maybe it's magic," slurs the lady looking like a bird dropped a wig on her head.

My sponsor laughs. Safe space, my ass.

But a broken clock, right? So a block down I find Madame All-Seeing Eye. She adjusts the straps of her giant brassiere like she's rolling up her sleeves, starts flipping cards.

Then like a switch she's screaming until she's sucking air. Repeatedly pointing at a card with a runaway horse dragging a peasant. Head grinding away to look like a pumpkin post October.

Madame's head has rolled back, babbling like a baby. I don't need this, my hand on the door when she manages to screech at me.

"You have a dark passenger!”

Next morning I wake up to find a dozen roses maxed out my last CC. Give the recipient a call. Our second date this week. We baked cookies for her office pot-luck. We played trivia. I held her after.

I try to be the guy she knows. "Feeling funny, Beautiful. Anything I should know?”

"Hmmm, well," and I'm thinking finally, "I think it's kinda funny how lost I get in those jet black eyes of yours.”

I can hear her smirking thinking this va-va-voom shit will do the trick.

I'm on the street next to a pawn shop. The glint of a ninja sword reflects my eyes looking cloudy like my spit after brushing.

She's hedging, confusing me with the dummy who plays her little games. I repeat what my lawyer once told me. "I have to know the truth before we continue together.”

She folds, tells me she followed me last night. Says I ambled on over to some cheap new build on the South Side. Knocked on a duplex with a heart on the door. A twenty-year-old girl who looks like a thumb answered, then I just hugged the butterball.

"Yep. Just a cuddle. Like a big ol' bear with his cub.”

I sure can pick 'em. Except I didn't! Quick dial tone on Pot-Luck. Hope her office likes cookies with nut jobs.

I drag myself to the South Side, impressed I've legged it before 'cause I'm beat by the time I find the door with a heart on it. Thumbalina answers, my arms rise to hold her, but I'm still me, so I shove her over instead.

Inside smells like fresh baked cookies. Candles surround a pile of crushed stubbies. Those poor excuses for water bottles. Squat little pee-wee's you see sweatin' in a big tub at a bbq, or collapsing fast as you sip 'em in the back seat of a…

Wait a fuckin' minute. "You're my Uber driver from last week?!”

On the ground she's adjusting her bike shorts, avoiding looking at me.

"What's up, Honey? Spill or I'm calling corporate.”

That does it. She starts stammering that each water bottle has saliva and fingerprints, letting her become its user. Puppet her passenger and see how they like it. Gig economy got this broad bent.

"I gave you five stars!" I yell at her. "Why me, bitch?!”

"Witch," she corrects me.

Cue the waterworks. "You look like my dad.”

I feel my face screw up. ”So you're whoring me out?!” I say.

"He's dead. It’s layered,” she says.

Try gross, Meatloaf, I think as I watch her flop onto her stomach.

She's struggling to stand, on all fours with her ass pointed to me like it wants a word.

"Dad was a prick too," she says kind of out of breath. “You’re his do-over."

I'm picturing her on that runaway horse, her bike shorts up her crack in the saddle. She's looking back at me getting pulled along leaving one long bloody streak. The kind on the pavement the night of that accident. The kind that reduces you to nothing.

I move to her front and pull her up into a hug fast. Guess she's not expecting it 'cause her arms fold up like a corpse between us. Into my chest she's speaking hot muffled breath. Onions for dinner, huh, babe?

Whatever. There was nothing before, and this is something. I'm just along for the ride now. I think of that peasant again, his head almost gone, but his arms up in surrender. Or like he’s on a coaster free falling. Enjoying the ride? Or terrified? I’ll wake up tomorrow and find out.
