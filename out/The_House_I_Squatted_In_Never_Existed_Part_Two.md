I woke late, my eyes shocked open by another nightmare. I grabbed my phone, and the clock read ten through the cracked screen. I also found a message from Maddie.

*Be by around noon. Hope you slept well.*

I messaged back saying I’ll see her then and stretched. My body felt like it had run a marathon. The bed was comfortable, but my mind couldn’t stop running a million miles a minute. Darren. My mom. Maddie. This house. Then it came back to me: the door. I had forgotten about it in my slumber, and now I felt my body shiver as I remembered it. 

*It was just a dream.*

It didn’t feel like one. It felt too real. The way my entire body recoiled when my hand gripped that knob wasn’t a fantasy. I slipped out of bed and walked to the entrance of the room, and hesitated before I opened the door. 

*Don’t be there, please don’t be there.*

It was there. But something was different. My eyes scanned up and down to find what was different about it. I flashed my memory back to last night and tried to remember every detail. That’s when it clicked.

It changed color. Not by much, but it was noticeable. Last night, it was a dark brown. It was lighter now. And that small change made my stomach drop. 

It laughed again. Childlike, squeaky, like some kid was running around behind there. I reached again but pulled back. Whatever was behind this door, whatever the hell this door was, I wanted nothing to do with it. I gave it one final glance before I stepped down the hall and into the empty living room. It was only ten-thirty. 

I slumped against the wall and brought my knees to my chest. I had just realized how heavily I was breathing and the fact that my body couldn’t stop shaking. I steadied my breath and rested my head against the wall. It was just a door. I shouldn’t have had such anxiety over a fucking door. 

I looked to the kitchen to my left and felt unease in my stomach again. I was so focused on that door that I never realized how strange the kitchen was. The house itself was built modern—for the time anyway—but the kitchen looked a decade behind. Mostly wood, the stove looked ancient; there wasn’t even a microwave. I stood slowly and walked my way to the kitchen. As soon as I stepped foot into the kitchen, the wooden floor creaked beneath me. 

The cabinets that hung on the wall were crooked, and one of the doors was stuck open. The oven was filthy, as if someone had been using it for years, with a stovetop to match. My anxieties turned into confusion. Who the hell would build a kitchen like this in a house like this? The rest of the house looked like it belonged, probably built in the nineties. But the kitchen—I couldn’t place it.

I heard a knock at the door. *Shit,* I thought, *someone found me.* Then I pulled out my phone and saw it was noon. It had been an hour. That was impossible. I woke up at ten, came into the living room at ten-thirty. How was it noon? How the hell did I lose *an hour and a half?*

I was going crazy. With everything that had been going on, I was just losing my mind. No matter how much sleep I got, that wouldn’t fix it.

I shook myself back to reality when I realized it was likely Maddie at the door. I rushed across the house and opened the front door to find her stood there, cradling grocery bags in her arms. “Morning, idiot.” She smiled and stepped in, handing me a bag to hold. “How was your first night?” I stared at her for a moment and wondered what my answer should be.

“Fine.” I replied with a small, forced smile. She saw right through it.

“Don’t lie to me, loser.” She set the bag she was holding on the counter. “You look miserable.” 

“It’s just…weird.” I admitted. Maddie turned to me, her lips curved into a half smile. 

“Tough guy scared of the big house?” The teasing tone in her voice got a genuine chuckle out of me. 

“The big *empty* house scares me.” I replied and set down the other bag she gave me. “It’ll just take a while to get used to, is all.” Maddie kissed my cheek and patted my face lightly.

“Come on, big guy. I brought more than this.”

Dating the rich girl certainly had its perks. We dragged from her cherry red Mercedes three more bags of groceries, a backpack full of my clothes—it was easy to get into my house when my mother was passed out on the couch—and a six-pack of Coors Banquet. “It was hard to find somewhere that didn’t recognize me!” She yelled at me as she handed it to me.

As we walked back to the kitchen to set everything down, I froze. 

It looked normal. When Maddie walked into it, the floor didn’t creak. The stove was polished, the cabinets were pristine—it belonged. Maddie turned to look at me from the fridge. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” She remarked. I took a second to answer. 

“Just…didn’t get a lot of sleep.” I lied through my teeth. “And I missed you.” Didn’t need to lie for that one. She smiled and shook her head. 

“You’re corny.” Her hands smoothed over the now granite countertop as her eyes scanned over the groceries she brought. “This should be enough for the week, maybe two if you’re frugal.”

“You know I am.” I joked as I leaned on the countertop and looked her in the eye. “Thank you for all this, Mads. You didn’t have to-”

“Don’t you finish that sentence.” She interrupted me. “I wanted to, and I did. End of story.” She crossed around the counter and wrapped her arms loosely around my neck. Her lips pecked mine and I felt all the dread leave my body. With her here, the suffocation of this house had less of a grip. Maddie had a habit of doing that. “I brought my laptop. Why don’t we get in bed, you have a beer and we watch some dumb movie?” I smiled at the suggestion and pecked her lips. 

“You know me so well.”

Maddie gathered her laptop and a box of Cheez-Its (I knew those were just for her the second I saw them) while I grabbed a still-too-warm bottle of Coors. She squealed down the hallway and I followed her with a laugh. But I froze at the doorway.

It was gone.

That door was *gone.* It was just a wall. A normal, beige wall.

I swear my heart stopped.

My hand, shaky and uncertain, reached and touched the wall. The cold still lingered, but it was just a wall. Just a fucking wall. 

My other hand gripped the bottle too tightly. My eyes couldn’t leave the wall. The door was there, I saw it, I felt it, how the hell did it just disappear? 

“Your room’s on this side, stupid.” I jumped at Maddie’s voice and turned to her. “Jesus, you’re jumpy.” I forced out a laugh and cleared my throat.

“Like I said, not much sleep.” Her face dropped for a moment as her hand reached for my arm. 

“Talk to me.” She cooed quietly. “What’s going on?”

“Nothing.” I said quickly. “Just…need to relax.” A sweet smile curved onto her lips, and she gave me another small kiss. 

“Come on. We’ll relax, promise.” 

We curled up in bed and watched Mean Girls. Well, she watched it. I watched half of it until I fell asleep in her arms. 

I dreamed of the door.

Just me and the door. I stared at it for what felt like hours. My breath was visible in front of me, and my entire body was covered in goosebumps. I felt nothing but fear. My heart raced, and my breath was frantic. 

I couldn’t move. I felt frozen. 

The door opened. 

There was a void inside the doorway—nothing but black. 

But I could feel it. I could feel someone, *something* watching me. I wanted to run. All I wanted to do was run, like I had all my life.

My eyes darted open. The lights were off, and I was alone. My hands instinctively reached for Maddie, but they came up empty. I groaned and sat up, only to feel a piece of paper attatched to my shirt. I pulled it off and grabbed my phone, using the flashlight to light up the paper. My eyes strained to read the words hurriedly written in her lipstick.

*Had to run, Dad called. I’ll be back tomorrow, I promise. Make sure you get enough sleep, okay? I worry about you. See you later, loser. - Maddie*

I couldn’t help but smile as my eyes scanned the page. I put the note down and reached for the bottle I left on the floor. It was empty. I sighed and swung my legs over the side of the bed, and forced myself to the lightswitch. The lights took a moment to flick on, and when they did, I felt a sense of relief and terror.

It was back.

The door stood opposite of the doorway I was in, and it had changed more. The color was now a crisp white, and the cold got worse. The knob was frosted, and ice had frozen over the frame of it. I shivered. My feet forced themselves to take a few careful steps towards the anomaly. My shivering grew more intense. It laughed again. 

“It was your fault!” A cold voice called behind the door. My breath hitched, and I stepped back. The voice sounded familiar, but I couldn’t place it. I didn’t want to place it. My heart pounded in my chest. The knob turned slightly. 

I ran.

I ran into the living room and switched the lights on. My breaths were ragged and heavy as I stared down the hall. I knew that voice, how the hell did I know that voice? 

The lights shut off.

“Shit.” I mumbled and fished my phone out of my pocket. I flicked on the flashlight and screamed. I fell on my ass and my phone hit the floor. It landed face down and lit up the center of the room. It lit up what startled me.

There was a woman in front of me. She faced away from me, her brunette hair cascaded down her back. Her dress was dark blue and full of holes and rips. She stood perfectly still. Eerily still.

“H-hello?” I breathed out shakily. No answer. My eyes darted around the room and found another body stood behind me. It was a man, his hair was buzzed off, and the suit that adorned him was also nearly ripped to shreds. “What the fuck?” I whispered and stood on wobbly legs. I grabbed my phone and threw the light around the room. 

More bodies. Frozen in time. Faced against the walls and corners of the room. “Who the fuck are you?” I screamed at all of them as I spun in place. It seemed like they were multiplying. I felt my breathing quicken, it felt like the space was getting tighter and tighter. My heart was going a mile a minute. 

Then I stopped. 

Right in front of me stood a woman in a ruined wedding dress. She faced me. She was the only one.

She was my mother.

“Laura?” I asked skeptically. Her expression was blank. Her eyes were black and emotionless. Against my better judgment, I stepped forward, “M-mom? What are you doing here?” I asked quietly.

“Why, Kris?” Her voice echoed in the room. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. 

“What?”

“It was your fault.” Her black eyes darted to me. “It was always your god damn fault!” She took a step towards me. I felt stuck in place as she closed the distance between us. “Nothing but a little fuck up. Since the day you were born-”

“Stop-” She grabbed my face in her hand. Her hands were so cold, her fingers burned on my skin. I watched as a black tear rolled down her cheek.

“Your father did a good thing, dying before he could see what a piece of shit you’d become.”

“Shut up!” I screamed and found the strength to push her off. She didn’t stumble, just simply floated backwards and kept her gaze on me. I felt tears sting in my eyes. Every person in the room turned to face me. I held my breath. It felt as though I was waiting for the dream to be over.

“Hell is your own creation.” They all spoke in unison, their voices all blending into a choir of accusations. “Face it before it consumes you.” I looked back to my mother—or whatever the hell was wearing my mother’s skin—and she spoke again.

“He’d be so disappointed in you.” 

Light filled the room again.

They were all gone.

I fell to my knees. I couldn’t even begin to think about what the hell just happened.

All I had the capacity to do, was cry.
