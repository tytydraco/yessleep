The wind had stopped screaming hours ago, which is worse. When it screamed, like a crow with a rock stuck on its throat, it meant that ***they*** were far— probably chasing something or *someone* else. But the latter is unlikely, everyone else is dead, as I see it. 

I stumbled into the hut just before dusk, mud crusted on my boots, the salt on my pouch nearly empty, the iron I have stolen from the blacksmith starting to rust from the mixture of blood that it came in contact with. The sky had turned the color of rotten meat— red and wet— and I knew it's only a matter o time before the light would have dimmed completely.

I sealed the door with what remains of my salt, hands trembling as I whispered a prayer that I have been desperately reciting for God knows how long— but does *he* know? I then traced sigils on every windows with ash, the acrid smell of burned bones does not affect me anymore, as I whispered more incantations that does nothing to fill the consuming silence.  These symbols hold... for now, at least.

The hut was bare, the fireplace long cold, table overturned, walls smelling of mildew and cobwebs holding dust in each corner. It was then that I smelled it, a parchment. Burnt, old, and wrong. 

Beneath the loose boards, hidden under a scatter of brittle petals of chrysanthemums, I found it. A letter wrapped in a strip of skin, the surface has yellowed, edges curled and flaking. The ink had already bled into the fibers, but it still was readable... for the most part. But the faint smell of iron makes me believe it wasn't ink that was used to write on this. My fingers knew not to touch, but the will to understand outweighs my fear at this point.

I unrolled it, and the first line burned my eyes: 

*"By the Light, preserve this parchment. If you found it, it means you have survived the breaking of the Seventh Seal..."*

I read the [rest](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1nx20ii/sisterhood_of_the_helm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) in silence, lips trembling as I cling to every word. Everything in the parchment matched what had happened since the sky fell— that the sun lies, the earth is hollow, and the gods have turned their faces away. But it wasn't the rules that chilled me, it was the voice that wrote them.

There was a brief moment, somewhere between the lines about the crows and the bells, when the ink changed. It grew darker, almost breathing, as it whispered while I traced it with my eyes. 

*"I am watching. I am eternal. I am inevitable."*

I dropped the parchment then, but it did not completely fall. It clung into my fingers like a second skin, and the words moved, shifted between shapes, as though someone was rewriting them beneath my gaze. I thought I saw my own name scrawled between the lines for a second before the ink swallowed it whole again.

That is when *someone* called my name. 

It sounded like my sister. But that's impossible. She burned on the third day of the Breaking. I watched firsthand how her flesh melted into lumps, how her bones turned to glass. 

The parchment told me not to answer, it told me to count the crows. There were six on the roof when I looked— six pairs of black eyes looking at me through the cracks in the beams. 

*"Six crows for lies, who speaks with your own voice."*

Then three opened their wings and flew upwards to the sky, the darkness seem to consume them as they squawked with a sound that never really seemed to be their own. 

*"Three crows for a sister, who who no longer has her eyes."*

The hut then vibrated, timbers creaking like old teeth. The knocking came in steady rhythms, the light of my lantern bending sideways drawn towards the door, every shadow leaning with it. The air grew dense, the scent of rot now seeping through the cracks. Something outside moves, I can see it from under the door, stepping just an inch away from the salt that I had placed. 

The knocking grew louder, as if it was thunder, it went on and on and on until... *silence*. The kind of silence that isn't empty, but waiting. I did not dare breathe.

Something pressed against the wood, not a hand nor a claw, something softer... wetter. The boards bowed inward, groaning. From the cracks, a thin line of darkness seeped in, not the absence of light but its devouring. When it spoke, it did not use my sister's voice anymore, but mine. 

*"You read it..."* it said, *"Now I see you."*

The wind began again, but this time, it did not scream. It laughed. The remaining crows outside took flight all at once, their wings beating against the roof until dust rained down like ash, then my lantern went out. I clutched the parchment tightly, feeling it throb like a heart.

The door whispered as it splintered, and I whispered back, the last words of prayer I no longer believed in, as I drew the rusted iron close to my chest.

*If this reaches another witch, know that I tried.*  
*Know that i kept the salt line whole until the end.*  
*Know that when they come for you, they already know your name.*
