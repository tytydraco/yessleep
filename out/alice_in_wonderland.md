it's all over, i thought.

memories slip from the back of my mind, they form like clouds above my eyelids as i remember everything.

clouded intuition, blinded by desperation.

&#x200B;

for the first time,

i gave everything i had. my heart, my mind, the fire of my soul. i slept like a baby knowing that no matter what happened in life, you would be by my side. 

the cluster in my heart melted when i felt your warm embrace; your staggered breaths stumbled onto my neck and down the rabbit hole i fell once again.

&#x200B;

alice is in wonderland,

trees are looming and the clouds above are opaque and dark. obscure darkness cloaks the world below, the inky depths of the sky blots out the sun. here in wonderland, there is nothing you cannot expect; tell white lies, seal them with a kiss, drink a cup of poisoned tea, who cares about the risk? 

up, up, up the streams of my tears goes, slowly filling this box i'm trapped in. my body far too frail to endure, i dive into the madness of it all with a small sense of hope, illuminating the innocent memories from the back of my head.

&#x200B;

hit me again, i dare you. clench your fists and grab me by the hair; make me fall to my knees and plead for forgiveness while you lecture my immaturity. buy me makeup the following day and make me cover your intense love marks, as you say. when it's all over, you fall into your slumber, waiting for another day to use your excuse once more.

&#x200B;

alice is in wonderland,

please just have a laugh with me; we're all mad here in this harsh reality. let us dance into the middle of this wicked game called love. waltz your way into my heart like for the first time again. show me that every scar you engrave in my bones is a medley of your  desires, guide me to the focal point of your fetish and let me satisfy it. and as the fog lingers ahead and the sun conceals away, i'll fall into your arms and let my yearning convey.

&#x200B;

convulsing violently; sprawled across the floor, my nose unable to subside the growing pain, i lay there, helpless and stupid, waiting for another kick. you grab my chin and slowly pull me to your face, my expectations deceive me as i meet your eyes. 

we stay, unmoving. deep breaths, dried tears and unnerving frowns. with a jolt, you grab my waist and slowly work your mouth up my neck. is it over? are we done fighting? can we stay like this, please? as if instinct, i wrap my arms around your back and gulp down my saliva. my vision blurs and darkness envelops me all around.

&#x200B;

alice is in wonderland,

would you care for a drink or two? stay with us darling, watch all your doubts dissipate with a clink of a glass. "nothing lasts forever", to hell with it! live your life, my friend, paint the halls of your world with sunshine and rainbows, keep marching on into the uncertain labyrinth that is life. 

and for a while everything seemed right, my mind elated, and my body light as a feather. but the more i stay with them, the more the illusion fades away. 

i just want to go home. but i'm not sure it's safe anymore.

&#x200B;

i awake in an unfamiliar place. my eyes dart around, hoping to see you somewhere nearby. a floor damp and cold, my limbs far too heavy for me to carry, i drag myself to a door and scratch my nails on its hard surface. soon, i bang on the door, hoping for an answer of some sort, but to my avail, nothing happens. please let me out, i swear i'll be a good girl; your good girl. strip me of my ego and fuck me like a lifeless body.

all i need is your touch, feel every single part of me. mark me like i'm your property and throw me around like a ragdoll. i'd give up my life to feel that giddiness of falling in love again. but that's all i can do. hope.

and i stay laying on the floor, waiting eventually, for you let me out and repeat this cycle like we always do.

&#x200B;

i am alice in wonderland,

the gates open upon my arrival. your silhouette comes into view and i rejoice; red roses adorn the murals surrounding us. you push me on the ground, sliding your tongue across my earlobe as you rub my neck with your fingers. a long journey finally over, happy i am at last. 

the grip tightens, your hands now choking my neck and soon i find myself gasping for air as my body beginning to drain. looking into your eyes, once filled with emotion, now completely devoid. everything narrows down to myself.

i try to wake up from this demise i forged from reminiscence, abuse and heartache. albeit all my efforts, i can't escape what's fated to be. i loved, lost and grieved over and over again. like the finale in a theatrical spectacle, the red roses fall onto my corpse, my arms stretch out and i feel the burning sensation in my throat pulsate. the opulent sun shines on me like never before. that's how the story goes.

&#x200B;

i am not alice in wonderland, 

i am the product of a physical obsession, manifested by all means. what's left is a carcass worn out like a used tire. i am starving; hungry for love and desperate for your attention. i am the flesh the maggots adore as i decompose in that lonely room.

&#x200B;

scratches all over the door, my body shrunken and dead. i raise a toast to the spark that ignited a visceral of an enigmatic wildfire, the fool who kept giving and giving until there was nothing left. alice is gone and down the rabbit hole i fall once again.
