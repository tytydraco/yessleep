This is one of the most bizarre cases I have investigated during my 5 years as an agent with the ******* Bureau of investigation.

At approximately 9:00pm October 25 2020, I received a phone call from my superior requesting my presence at a rural area outside of town. He never stated why, but he sounded uncharacteristically rattled. Due to the nature of crime I typically deal with I expected the worse, but this was something I couldn’t have fathomed in my wildest dreams.

I got off the couch and headed upstairs to get dressed, I looked at my wife as she laid in bed and just gave her “ The look”. She knew that meant it was work related, she was used to it by now. I walked out to the driveway and felt a cool breeze, driving through town it was eerily quiet even for a Sunday night due to Covid restrictions, it gave me the chills. I turned on to the interstate and watched the city lights fade away in my rear view. After about 30 minutes of driving my gps directed me to take the next exit.  I exited the off ramp and came to an intersection, again, dead quiet no cars on the road particularly in this suburban part of town, I followed Main Street until I hit the outskirts of town and headed down a long two way road. After another 20 minutes of driving I turned off down a dirt road, and I began to see the police lights in the distance.

As I got closer I could see a one story Folk Victorian house on a large plot of land isolated with agents and state police standing outside with squad cars blocking entrance to the scene. I got out, put on my face mask and flashed my badge to the officer securing access. As I walked across the yard and approached the house I saw a fellow agent and asked him if he could tell me where special agent ******** was. He said he would walk me to his location, we crossed the yellow tape and put on shoe covers and gloves before we went inside the house. 

As the door opened I braced myself for the stench of death, to my surprise the house was spotless, and fairly modern with a huge wall mounted flat screen and nice furnishing, not what you would expect being out at a crime scene in the boondocks. I stopped, looked around, and asked the agent who was escorting me “What exactly happened here?”. He looked at me and shook his head and said “ You have to see it yourself”. We walked through the living room and down the hall, to the left was the kitchen, again, spotless, no dirty dishes this place looked as though it had not even been lived in. We walked further down the hallway and I walked into what appeared to be the children’s room, and I finally saw why I was called here.

Special agent ******** was watching as the crime scene investigators were taking pictures of the body. Again, the bedroom was spotless, the bed was made, complete with hospital corners. Toys neatly put away, shoes lined up perfectly at the foot of the bed.  But, right there in the middle of the floor was what appeared to be a little boy, Caucasian, about 8 or 9 years old, laying there lifeless , completely wrapped in plastic with both of his eyes missing. The child had no other visible injuries, and besides the obvious, was in pristine condition. I looked at ******** and just shook my head, he turned and motioned for me to follow him.  We walked further down the hallway and turned right and made our way to the master bedroom, I could see the camera flashes light up the room.

As we walked in, I again noticed the cleanliness of the room, but I began to notice the smell of what seemed to be hand sanitizer, then I realized I had been smelling it ever since I walked into the house, it just now seemed to have seeped through my face mask.  Again, on the floor lay a man and woman about mid-thirties, Caucasian, wrapped in plastic. The man was missing his nose and the woman missing her ears. Bodies in pristine condition. No other visible signs of injury or cause of death.I looked at ******* and asked “Is someone going to to tell me what the hell is going on?”. He looked at me and said “Let’s go outside”. We walked through the house back to the front yard.  

He explained to me that about 4 hours ago the sheriff’s department received an anonymous call, the caller simply gave the location and hung up. He said that the house was listed as a foreclosure and was listed as being owned by a elderly couple about a decade ago. When they arrived on the scene he said there were no cars or tire marks leading to the house. Just  three bicycles (one was a kids bike), and an electric generator in the back yard. None of the victims have any type of identification to verify who they are, no mail, no cell phones, no pictures, wallets, absolutely nothing. Just three John and Jane Does essentially.

A couple of weeks went by and the coroners could not determine a cause of death for any of the victims, they were absolutely baffled, toxicology reports showed no abnormalities, and there were no signs of trauma. The mutilation of the bodies was done with surgical precision and occurred post mortem.

The next four months we investigated the bizarre deaths; we talked to the locals, visited the schools , the stores, checked surveillance cameras, released the story to the local media all to no avail. These people simply did not exist, no one had ever seen them, people assumed the house was empty and they said they only knew of the elderly couple that lived there about ten years ago.


On March 19th 2021, fire fighters responded to a fire at the same house after locals who lived nearby reported seeing smoke billowing from the area. When they arrived the entire house was up in flames, after the fire was extinguished, a body was found in the rubble, burned beyond recognition. Autopsy report showed that the body was deceased before the fire but the cause of death was unknown.

The case is still open but with no leads, and I think about it everyday. I find it disturbing that people can live and die with no trace that they ever existed. I’m unsettled that someone out there is so skilled at killing that they can do so without leaving any signs or clues as to how when or why. Cases like this give me a bleak outlook on humanity, knowing that evil like this can exist. That child with no eyes is burned into my memory, it wasn’t a gruesome murder scene, but a very strange ,clean, cold and surgical one.
