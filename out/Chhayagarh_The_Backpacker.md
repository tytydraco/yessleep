You know how I keep telling you all not to come here? Well, we had a visitor today, and I think his story will serve as a good illustration of why it is both to your and my benefit for outsiders to stay the hell away.

Okay, it’s not that people don’t come and go without incident. But please, for the gods’ sake, read the room. If the gigantic board at the borders didn’t clue you in, this place is not exactly a metropolitan suburb. Things are afoot here. Be respectful, keep your head down, avoid the places that feel wrong, do what you need to do, and then get out.

But people think they know better. They think it’s all an elaborate joke, or that they can handle whatever comes. Well, something does come for them, eventually.

But I’ll get to that part later. First things first, the journal. As promised, I did try to go through it last night. Most of the journal is written by hand, and from what I read, the entries seem to be painstakingly reproduced copies of various documents that the writer has diligently transposed onto the pages in his own hand. I say ‘writer’ because the handwriting in this part is decidedly not my grandfather’s. I even went down to the study this morning to check out a few of his notes to compare, and the style doesn’t match up. In fact, almost every entry is in different handwriting. The journal has been through a variety of hands over the years, judging by the evolving vocabulary. Some of the earliest entries, in fact, are in chaste Sanskrit! I can read the script, in case you’re wondering, but I don’t understand the language. I’ll have to ask my youngest uncle for help in that regard. Some of the entries have marginal notes, mostly shorthand scrawls reflecting the writer’s opinions or inputs. I tried to read a few, but my concussed brain was already struggling to parse the larger, legible letters. We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. If I find any interesting accounts, I’ll share them with you.

What is more interesting, however, are the final twenty or so pages. Instead of normal lettering, these pages are a swirling well of ink. The contents keep shifting every moment, forming half-seen letters or geometric designs before fading into random noise again. The paper gives off a sickly sweet smell. Probably the same one Ram Lal was referring to, before he…

Only the first of these pages has any discernible information. Every so often, two well-defined symbols appear out of the muck, lingering for a second or two before fading away. One is a massive banyan tree. The other… a triskelion in a circle, inscriptions covering the ruin. I was up for a couple of hours last night, trying everything. I touched the pendant to the pages. I tried to look through it like a monocle. I put it under my tongue, whacked it on the cover, and rubbed it all over the pages.

Nothing.

The low light made it difficult to make out, but I managed to check the inscriptions on the rim against the illustration on the page. They are identical (kudos to my grandfather’s drawing skills, I suppose). I have the right item. I just have no idea how to use it.

You had too much faith in me, Dad.

Either way, these are the only pages that are obfuscated in this manner. My grandfather must have wanted to hide the contents from prying eyes, in this and the other. That meant these pages contained crucial information. Information needed to fight back against whatever had killed him. I don’t know what I’m doing this for anymore. Is it for the family? For the village? For myself? In any case, I have to figure out how to unlock these entries.

And I knew just who to ask about it.

The next morning, when I descended the stairs, Kirti was waiting for me. Oh, yeah. Writing ‘uncle’ was getting cumbersome, so I decided to give all three of my uncles some nicknames. Kirti is my eldest uncle, Sam is my middle uncle, and Naru, who you will meet soon enough, is my youngest uncle. These names are based on their real names, which I will not be revealing.

I won’t bore you with the details of our conversation. I apologized to him for my behaviour the previous day, but honestly, he didn’t seem too mad. Almost as if he had been expecting it. Maybe all the *Thakurs* behaved like spoiled brats when they were young. Either way, we chalked out a deal over breakfast: every evening, I would sit down with him and he would tell me a story about the village and its denizens. That’s fine by me. I’ve always loved stories since I was a kid. I used to keep my father up every night until he read me no less than five different bedtime stories. In any case, I am thankful to him for going the extra mile for me. As with the journal, if he tells me any good ones, I’ll be sure to pass them on to you.

The walking stick still feels so unfamiliar in my hands. I wouldn’t use it if there were any other choices, but Sam was right: I was in no condition to walk unassisted. Whenever my hand touched the contours of its aged, gnarled wood, I was reminded of my grandfather. Each and every clack of its metal tip against the floor reminded me of his presence, both physical and spiritual. Hanging over me, enveloping my life.

An unpaid debt. A legacy to fill.

Wearing his ring, using his cane, living in his house, it all felt the same. Like I was killing him a second time. Erasing the final vestiges of his presence here. I knew the others probably didn’t see it that way, but I did it. My head kept whispering the same thing over and over.

Usurper.

After my performance yesterday, it was not hard to agree with that sentiment. It seemed that, every time I did something, it got someone hurt or killed. Including me. The encounter with the begging monk was the fourth time I had been pushed to death’s door since coming here, and each time, I had only survived because someone had rescued me. Alone, I surely would have died. My own wits, strength, and resolve were far too inadequate for this place.

And I was running out of free assists.

Speaking of assists, my shoulder is fine now. The ice melted overnight, but the flesh was whole again. The only indicator that there was ever an injury there was the red, raw skin. That, and the ruined clothes. I had the servants burn the torn and stained shirt in the backyard. Ram Lal had been right. It was unsalvageable.

I had planned to laze about for a while until my appointment with the police, but as luck would have it, my meeting was drastically brought forward. I had scarcely finished breakfast when, with a great clicking of boots, a *khadi*\-clad officer stormed into the outer sitting room. Even without looking at his shoulder boards, I could tell that he was the inspector by his cap and baton. He was a sharp young man, about the same age as me. He had the fitness and energy I had come to recognize as some combination of the wide-eyed idealism of a new entrant in the service and the excitement of a new posting. His uniform being perfectly ironed and up to code only confirmed my diagnosis.

He quickly crossed over and gave me a salute. “Inspector Samaresh Bose, sir.”

I grabbed my stick, moving to stand up. “You don’t need to salute me, Inspector. I’m not your superior.”

“Please, sit,” he urged, settling down on the chair in front of mine. “It has been the custom in this village for the police to salute the *Thakur*, sir.”

“Really?”

“From the station records, it appears that there is a directive in force from the time of Governor-General Warren Hastings that stipulates that all officials of the administration shall salute and give ‘all possible dignity and respect’ to the *zamindars* of the village.”

“It’s been a long time since the 18^(th) century, Inspector Bose.”

“Even so, it was never withdrawn. Besides, law or no law, you are a pillar of the community. It cannot hurt to keep you in good spirits.”

I sighed. “As you will. How long have you been here, Inspector?”

“I was posted here about six months before the death of the previous landlord, sir. But my father was originally from Chhayagarh. He left for Kolkata to find work many years ago.”

“First posting?”

He puffed his chest out. “Yes, sir. Most of the constables and SIs are older than me and locals. But they have not given me any trouble.”

“Well, if you ever face any issues, do let me know. I heard of your efforts yesterday. You saved my life. Thank you.”

“I will do it as many times as necessary, *Thakur*.”

“That being said…” I glanced at the clock on the wall. “I was expecting you in the afternoon, Inspector.”

“I am aware, and I apologize for disrupting your routine. But this is urgent.” He leaned forward. “There has been an incident that requires your intervention.”

“I’m not sure how I can assist an investigation.”

“It’s an incident of… the other kind, sir.”

I perked up at that. He must have noticed, because he continued.

“I’ve not been here very long, but the others have briefed me on the peculiarities of the beat.”

“And you’re fine with these peculiarities?”

“It was a rough first few weeks. But duty is duty. Either way, I’ve been informed that in the case of these sorts of disputes, you are the one we should contact. I had worked with your grandfather a few times, before his untimely demise.”

“All right. I suppose this is a part of the job.” I rose. “Give me the details.”

“It would be easier to just show you, sir.” He snapped to his feet. “I’ve brought my jeep with me. Please join me at the spot.”

Kirti had wandered in, attracted by the sounds of the conversation. “Bose?”

“Mr. Sen.” Bose gave him a nod. “I will need to borrow the *Thakur* for a while if there is nothing urgent.”

“No, nothing for now. I was wondering if something was wrong. You’re not one to show up at the wrong time.” He turned to me. “Do you need me to come with you?”

Before I could answer, Bose said, “The *sarpanch* is already at the site, sir. He’s waiting for you.”

“Ah, if Naru is already there, you should have nothing to worry about.” Kirti’s face grew serious. “But be back as soon as you can. It’s not ideal to do this while you’re injured, but the ritual has to be performed tonight. Putting it off any longer can lead to dangerous consequences. Power struggles. Rampages. Curses.”

I agreed. If I concentrated a bit, I could feel the air changing with every moment. It was getting taut like a string, as if the world was holding its breath. Everything was on edge. Waiting for something to happen. I did not have the knowledge or context Kirti did, but even I could understand on an instinctual level: this tension needed to be settled, before something snapped and gave way.

Outside was the familiar shape of a rural police jeep. A familiar sight if you’ve interacted with the West Bengal Police as often as I have. The constable at the helm jumped out when he saw me and, predictably, tried to fall at my feet. After dodging these oblations like a Vietnam War draft, we were off.

The village roads, which had seemed so long on foot, passed by in a blur in the vehicle. I was on edge the entire journey, waiting for the Spirals or something worse to show up, but nothing did. Maybe they had backed off for now, since I had proven a tougher prey than anticipated. Or maybe it was the armed police officers with me. After all, if it can touch you, you can touch it, and so can a bullet.

“I didn’t know my uncle was the *sarpanch*,” I shouted over the guttural roar of the engine.

“He’s the *upa-sarpanch*, technically,” Bose shouted back. “Your grandfather was the *sarpanch*. Since his death, he is the acting village chief.”

“I see.”

“Don’t worry about it! I’m sure he’ll cede the seat to you in the next election!”

“That was not what I’m worried about.” I shook my head. “Politics is not for me.”

“The *panch* are rubber stamps anyway, *sahib*,” the driver commented, “Whatever you say, they will do.”

“Doesn’t sound very democratic.”

“Desperate times, desperate measures. And times are always desperate here.” Bose nodded at a small gathering by the roadside. “We’re here.”

The jeep had stopped near the outskirts of the urbanized part of the village. A crowd of a few score villagers were falling over each other to gawk at something, held back by a few uniformed constables. Bose walked up and tapped one of them on the shoulder.

“Is the circus here already?”

“What circus?” The villager answered, without turning back.

“There isn’t a circus?” Bose whacked his butt sharply with the baton. “Then why are you standing around gawking, you tramp? Get lost!”

He pushed through the crowd, clearing a path for me. As soon as they saw their superior officer, the constables acted busy, shoving and whacking a few people half-heartedly to get them to move along. It was mostly unnecessary; by now, the people had noticed my presence. Most of them backed away to clear a path. Some of the older ones bowed to me, folding their hands together.

On the other side, a few more policemen were standing around, nervously watching the situation unfolding in front of them. A young man with Caucasian features was in a most violent rage, shouting and pointing fingers at every aspect of the scenery. His scraggly beard was streaked with spittle. He wore a worn sky-blue t-shirt with jeans and a well-used hiking backpack was strapped to his body. I could see the telltale glint of a silver chain around his neck. Facing him was the Ferryman, sunglasses squarely over his eyes and an easy smile on his face. He had his hands raised in a supplicating gesture, but evidently, de-escalation wasn’t working very well.

A hand slapped my back. I turned to see a pair of friendly eyes crinkled into a grin.

“Finally, I get to see you, and it’s like this.”

“Uncle!” I smiled and hugged him.

Naru, my third uncle, was much younger than his brothers, only fifteen years older than me. Growing up, he probably hung out more with me than with my uncles, as the designated babysitter. As a result, I still saw him as more of a friend than a relative.

“I’ve been meaning to come see you for a while, you know,” he said, with a punch to my arm. “I finally make time tomorrow, and I come back to find that you are lying around with broken bones.”

“I was in bed, not unconscious. Costs nothing to visit.”

“Nah, Sam said you need the rest.”

One of the ASIs on the spot ran up and saluted the three of us. “*Thakur*, *Sarpanch ji*, you must do something. This is not going to end well.”

“What’s happening?” I asked. The scene did not make much sense to me.

Naru grimaced. “He’s a missionary. Looks like he came in by the first flight today from Delhi.”

“And straight to here?”

“He was proselytizing in one of the nearby villages,” Bose answered. “Apparently, some of the Christians told him that the people in this village practice black magic and cavort with demons. So, he came here straight away.”

“He’s been going around scolding and cursing all day, *sahib*.” The ASI produced a handkerchief to wipe the sweat off his forehead. “Ranting about witchcraft and devils and whatnot.”

“I’m guessing he found what he was looking for.” I dug the tip of my cane into the ground.

Great. Exactly what I needed right now.

“Wait here, all of you. I’ll go check on them.”

Naru must have noted my expression. “Don’t do anything stupid.”

“Of course not.” I marched over to them, digging my cane into the soft ground for support.

The man was still screaming, at a volume that I was pretty sure was impossible for a human being to sustain. “You foul demon, cast from the light of God, away from me!”

“Gladly,” the bus driver sighed, “but you have to stop screaming. People live and work here. You’re being a nuisance.”

“What’s going on here?” I planted my cane between them, hoping that my voice was authoritative enough.

“Ah, *Thakur*!” The Ferryman grinned. “I was wondering when you were planning to show up.”

The preacher sized me up, sneering. “Who the hell are you?”

“I am the landlord of the village in which you are acting like a rabid animal. So, I ask again, what the hell is going on here?”

“Ah, so it’s you.” He stalked up threateningly to me. He was well-muscled, with a stocky strongman build. “It is your patronage that allows the worship of Satan to persist among these people.”

I glared into his eyes, forcing him to come to a halt with a step or two still remaining between us. “It’s not been long since I’ve taken charge, but I’ve not noticed any Black Masses recently. Have you, Inspector Bose?”

“No, sir, none that I have noticed.”

The preacher scowled, trying to appear dangerous. Apparently, the virtues of non-violence did not exactly apply to devil worshippers-apparent.

To be honest, after all I had seen over the past few days, the idea that an overfed nut would be scary was laughable.

“You have devils and their servants roaming amongst your kind. I have it on good authority that this village is crawling with pagans and heretics. God has sent me to turn your hearts to the true faith.” He placed a meaty hand on my chest. “Repent and accept Jesus, or you will burn.”

I whacked his hand away with a flick of the cane. Irritation and frustration were rising like a volcano inside me.

Did I mention I have a few anger management issues?

“You will not come into my village and insult me, my friend. You’re disturbing the peace of this place. I *sincerely* request that you leave, and trouble us no further.”

“It is a free land. You cannot stop me.”

“You want to test that hypothesis out?” I snapped.

“Now, now.” The Ferryman stepped between us. “There’s no need for any of that—”

The man hawked and spat on his face.

The Ferryman’s words died in his throat, his smile becoming icy and false.

“Silence! I will deal with you later!” He turned back to me. “Forsake your false idols and accept the Lord into your heart, and you will be saved from sin! He is the way, the truth, and the life! No one comes to the Father except through—”

I’m not sure why I did what I did next. Maybe it was my rage that finally snapped. Maybe his inane one-note rambling was the straw that broke the camel’s back, uncorking the stress and frustration of the past few days. Or maybe, beneath it all, I was actually concerned for him. I was afraid of what the Ferryman would do to him if I did not act.

I raised my cane and slammed it into his cheek. The blow knocked him to the ground, prone and gasping for breath. Now, I did say he was a big guy. But you all should know that, despite my abysmal performance so far, I’m no slouch either. I used to do wrestling and boxing on the national level, before the litigation hours forced me to give it up. Almost everyone in our family is tall, stocky, and incredibly strong. Even my grandfather, at his age, could carry an entire bed up five flights of stairs by himself. My father once managed to lift a grand piano on his own.

If anything, I’m the runt of the litter.

“Inspector Bose!” I called.

Bose nodded and gestured to his men, who grabbed onto the man and hoisted him up. “Sir, I am placing you under arrest for affray, public nuisance, and hurting religious sentiments.”

“What, are you crazy?” He screamed. “He was the one who attacked me! Arrest him!”

“You’ll have your say at the station, sir.” He flicked his hand, walking over to me as two constables dragged him off to process him. “Don’t worry, sir. We’ll ensure he doesn’t contact anyone. Just in case.”

I frowned. “Just in case for what?”

“Just in case,” he repeated. “No one will know he’s here.”

I nodded, though I was still uncertain, and turned to the driver. “Are you all right?”

He took off his glasses, revealing his eyes. Probably due to the presence of the others, they were completely normal. “I’ve faced worse.”

The spit on his face bubbled and vaporized as if boiled away by some unseen force. “I see you’re settling into the feudal lord role just fine, kiddo.”

“I don’t think that interaction went anywhere close to ‘fine’.”

“It’s a good start. You just need a little more of that charming arrogance, and you’ll be set for life. Like your great-grandfather, for instance. He would’ve had that man beaten to death by his *lathials* and thrown in a ditch somewhere.”

“The good old days,” I quipped.

“Where, oh, where have they gone?” he chuckled, wiping the last few bits off the glasses before putting them back on.

“Thanks for keeping him occupied while I got here. I owe you one.”

He shushed me. “Do not say that. Never say that.”

“Say what?”

“You must never take on a debt unless you don’t have a choice. Not to us. You have no idea of the kind of things that can be demanded to settle a due.” He sighed. “We are not friends. We are distant acquaintances, conditional allies at best. Treat me that way. Carefully.”

I nodded. “I’ll keep that in mind.”

“I ferried him here. That makes his conduct my responsibility. You have nothing to thank me for. Besides, it’s not me you need to worry about.” He jerked his thumb at something behind him. “I wasn’t the first one to find him.”

Near one of the buildings, in a shadowed corner, the Man in the Cloak was sitting on the ground. Though his hat covered his head, I could tell he was watching me. When I finally noticed him, he noiselessly stood and disappeared into one of the alleys.

The message was clear. Follow me.

I waved over the ASI from before. “That man… before he was fighting with the driver… Did he talk to anyone else?”

“Like I said, sir, he was ranting at empty air. Tossing water everywhere, waving a Bible, the works.”

“Right. Empty air.”

“Something wrong?” My uncle walked up, noticing my concerned expression.

“I think this guy ran into the Man with the Cloak.”

“The man with the cloak? You mean—”

I nodded. “Wait here. I’ll go have a chat.”

“Alone?”

“I’m the only one who can see him, isn’t it?” Before he could respond, I was off, limping into the alley he had chosen.

It didn’t take long to find him. As soon as I rounded the first corner, he was waiting, his lanky form towering over me. He had deliberately tilted his hat to hide his face, but I felt the now-familiar pressure emanating from him regardless. But it wasn’t as bad as last time. Whether it was because he was restraining himself or because of my ring, it was impossible to tell.

“*Thakur*,” he said simply.

“I heard you had a little run-in with our guest.”

“It is the first time in many years that a man has approached me of his own accord. When men see me, they run.” He released a guttural roar that I assumed was a sigh. “Zeal makes your kind do strange things.”

Believe me, I know. I read Wikipedia.

“Did he hurt you?”

“He does not have the strength. But…” The man took off his hat, showing his face. To my shock, it was a bubbling mess now, the smooth surface rent by wrinkles and blisters. “It was the water. It cannot kill me, but it has its inconveniences.”

“Will it—”

“Yes, it is not a wound, not strictly. It will heal. But I have been insulted. Gravely.”

“You did not kill him? That’s some impressive restraint.” I folded my arms. “I thought your kind were quick to anger. Or is that only reserved for me?”

His aura exploded in a searing-hot burst of rage, almost knocking me back. “I wish to crack his bones and feast on his marrow. I wish to pluck his eyes out and hang them from a tree. I wish to wear his skin and run through the streets. I wish to do much worse, such that every man, woman, and child will have nightmares of his fate for all time to come. I wish to rampage and punish everything in sight for the sin of his existence. But I have not. So far.”

I managed to push back against him, standing my ground. “Why not?”

“My promise.” His anger slowly subsided, letting me relax. “I have decided to give you this opportunity, young lord.”

“An opportunity? For what?”

“To keep the peace.” He laid an immense, clawed hand on my shoulder. “Your actions have not left a good impression. This is a chance to correct that. The *Thakur* is not just our jailer. You are our protector, the same as you are for the humans. You must enforce the old laws. Ensure that debts are paid on both sides. That is how you will gain respect. Strength. Alliances.”

“So…” I took a deep breath. It was time for lawyer mode. “You are willing to compromise?”

“He has besmirched my dignity. If am not redressed, if I cannot enforce my claim… I shall lose face. My influence will wane, and many who are now cowed by my wrath shall move more freely.”

“What do you want?”

“By the old laws, *Thakur*, I demand blood price.”

“You want to kill him? That cannot be the only option.”

“The extent of the compensation will depend on him. I understand that your kind flinch at death, even well-deserved death. So, I will give two options in the interest of peace. If he is willing to apologize, to recant, I will leave him alive. Not whole, no. That cannot be. But he will live. If not…” His grip tightened on my shoulder. “I shall have a feast.”

“So, you either maim him or you kill him? Neither of those sounds like a good option to me. He’s an ass, but he doesn’t exactly deserve to die for it. How about I just kick him out?”

He dropped his hand. “And allow him to leave without consequence? Surely you understand that it is not sufficient punishment.”

“He didn’t actually harm you. You said it yourself.”

“Harm of the flesh matters little to us, young lord. Harm of the spirit does. We are created, sustained, and empowered by symbols. Icons, ideas, and legends. That is what gives us form, meaning, and purpose when we step through the veil. If I allow him to go unpunished, if you allow him to go unpunished, my meaning, my symbol, my core will change. I will become a force that cannot protect itself. Weak. Unworthy. My enemies shall be freed to act against you. And my allies will resent you.”

“But killing—”

“Our laws are not your laws. We keep the old ways. If you break from them, no one will recognize you. No one can. It is our law that will bind the compacts you make with my kind. If you cannot follow it, you cannot be trusted.” He raised a slender finger. “But if you prove yourself, you will earn attention. Attention that can quickly turn into favour. You can protect the land. You can protect yourself. Is the life of one outsider worth losing all of that?”

It was tempting, to be sure. The Ferryman, the Lady in White, the Man in the Cloak. They had all helped me in some way, at one point or another. Without their aid, I would be dead already. Having a paranormal bodyguard on speed dial did sound like a good deal.

“Just to be clear, if he apologizes, you will not kill him?”

“I will not kill him either way, *Thakur*, you will. You are the lord. Enforcing the law is your responsibility. Especially after tonight. Tonight, you formally assume control of the land. Those who recognize your authority will look to you for aid. Those who do not will work against you, and you will need to root them out. Even with your family’s resources, you can—” He transitioned seamlessly into a new sentence, as if it was something he had been intending to say all along. “Do not move. Do not look back. Do not speak.”

“What?” Before I could continue, I felt it.

A pall fell over the world, leaching it of all colour. The stony road faded to a dull shade of gray. The sky became a ghostly white, specked with slightly darker clouds. The buildings lost all definition, light and shadow blending into a confusing ashen mess. The Man in the Cloak remained mostly unaffected, already almost wholly black-and-white. But he did not move a muscle (did he even have any?), simply looking straight ahead.

Hot, slimy breath brushed against my nape. My hair stood on end as something very, very close let out a growl, the low sound reverberating inside my ribcage like a drum. There was the slight snick of claws scraping on rocks as it paced uncertainly. My heart pounded uncertainly. There was something about this thing.

Its aura was different from the Man in the Cloak. Where he was heavy and inevitable, this thing was overwhelming, brimming with barely contained frenzy. It was a wild animal, tearing at the leash. And I couldn’t help but feel it could tear out of its binds whenever it wanted.

Then, the growl came close to my ear, gradually changing into a voice.

Or rather, voices. Thousands of them, overlapping into a din of harsh whispers that was almost incomprehensible.

“Finally.”

In the very next instant, the presence was gone. The world returned to its usual state. I gasped, gripping my cane so hard that my knuckles turned white. I almost didn’t notice my legs giving way until my shoulder slammed into the alley wall.

“It is regaining its strength.” Even through the strange timbre of his voice, I could tell that the Man in the Cloak was grim. “Your grandfather bought us some time that night, but it is quickly running out.”

“The journal. You and my grandfather… before he…” I panted. “You did something to the journal.”

“We did. We should have done it sooner, while your father was alive.”

“What did you do?”

“I will tell you. If you can complete this challenge. I will not waste my breath on a *Thakur* doomed to failure. If you want more of my aid… earn it.”

“You know what happened that night. You just won’t tell me.” I was so done that I threw caution to the wind, pouring as much hate into my glare as I could. “You’re extorting me. And you know what? I don’t care for it. If you’re going to be an ass, I don’t need your help. I have my family. We’ll handle it.”

He titled his head, worldlessly studying me. Now that I had said my piece, my logical brain had finally caught up, banging against the side of my skull and screaming. I had made a big mistake. These things did not give second warnings.

“Tonight,” he said finally. “They will send you into the forest. I will leave something for you there. A piece of the puzzle. So you know that I do not lie.”

Wait.

“You’re not going to kill me?”

Shit, I said the quiet part out loud.

He made a sound, like the grinding of rocks deep underground. Was that supposed to be a laugh?

“Take this.” He reached into his cloak and produced a piece of yellowed parchment. There was writing on it, but like the entries in the journal, it shifted constantly, never staying on one thing for even a second. “If the man agrees to recant, let him cut off a finger. Any finger.”

“Just that? A finger?”

“I will take less than my due and be satisfied, since you have requested so politely.” He made the grinding sound again. “Let him put three drops of his blood on this parchment, and leave it with the finger anywhere on the land. I shall find it, and consider the debt paid. Then, he may leave.”

It was still not ideal, but much better than I had expected. Though my experience was more on the human side of things, I could tell pushing him more would backfire.

“I will see what I can do.”

He nodded, replacing his hat back on his head. “I remember when your grandfather first insulted me. It was then I knew that we would be… friends. Maybe there is hope for you, after all, *Thakur*.”

I exhaled, letting go of a knot of tension I didn’t know I had. I didn’t understand why he had treated me differently this time. The last time I had even spoken a little rudely, he had almost killed me. And now we were firmly on track for BFF Land?

I don’t get these ‘old ways’.

Before I could ask him to clarify, he walked straight into the wall, phasing through as if it didn’t even exist. His presence faded, and I knew I would get nothing more for now.

By the time I returned to the clearing, the preacher had been carted off to the police station. The crowds had also dispersed, leaving only the inspector and my uncle behind.

“How did it go?” Naru asked.

“Better than expected.” There was no other way to answer that question. “But he wants… blood price.”

His face grew serious. “How much? Half?”

“Just a finger, actually. Provided he apologizes.”

“Just a finger?” It seemed as if he was going to say something, but he decided against it. “And if not?”

“Everything.”

He nodded. This was evidently more in line with his expectations.

“Then I’m guessing you want me to hold him in custody, sir.” Bose sighed. “But, frankly, I do not think he is going to apologize.”

As much as I hated to admit it, he was right.

“How much time do we have?” I asked my uncle.

“This one is one of the more reasonable ones. We can get a day or two out of him. Any longer, and he will consider the agreement forfeited.”

Bose leaned in, dropping his voice. “Sir… Do we take care of it? I haven’t recorded the arrest in the records yet. If he disappears, well… he disappears. No proof he ever came here.”

“Except, like, fifty villagers.”

“They will never testify against you. No one here will. Just give the word.”

“No.” My uncle spoke before I could. “The *Thakur* is judge, jury, and executioner of the old ways. Even if the punishment is meted out, it will have to be him.”

I was not aware that I would have to personally murder that guy, but I could see why a shrewd negotiator would want to leave that part out. Well played. “Either way, we have to at least give him a chance.”

“As you wish.” The inspector nodded. “I’ll put him in the pen.”

“But keep it off the books,” Naru warned.

“Of course.” He gave me a final salute before hopping in the jeep and riding off.

“Um…” I pointed at the rapidly fading silhouette of the vehicle. “Wasn’t that our ride?”

Naru laughed, patting my back. “I have my car at the Panchayat Office. I just need to grab a few records, and then we’ll go back to the manor together. We need to catch up, and prepare for the ritual too.”

“What about this nonsense?” I waved the paper in the air.

“Tomorrow. This takes precedence. Come on, it’s not far on foot.”

We got to the office in less than two minutes. No one else was in, so my uncle told me to sit in the waiting area while he went in and grabbed the files. From the looks of it, though my grandfather was the *sarpanch*, it was he who handled most of the actual work anyway. I could see why. This landlord business was full-time work. So I took the opportunity to type this out while I waited.

The Man in the Cloak said I would get a clue tonight, during the ritual. By the way, I still don’t know what this ritual entails. Everyone has been remarkably clammy about it, and that is never a good sign when it comes to ancient rituals. Assuming I survive that, I then have to go deal with Mr. Spawn of Satan again, and hopefully get him to apologize. Every single day, some new aspect of this world opens up to me, and I’m pretty terrible at all of them so far. Here’s hoping that will change.

In any case, buckle up. This is going to be [wild](https://www.reddit.com/r/chhayagarh/).
