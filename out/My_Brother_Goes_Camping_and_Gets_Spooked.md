This never happened to me personally, but my brother told me the story about 2 years ago in a conversation about scary stuff we’ve experienced. This one was the most chilling of the few shared between us.

Around 2-3 years ago my brother and 2 of his friends decided that they were going to camp in the woods near a local town that was about 15 minutes away from where we lived. I think at the time he was around 18 at the time and his friends were similar ages. They all gathered the typical necessities you needed while camping. A tent, some sleeping bags, pots and pans, and an axe. 

I don’t know most of the details about what happened in the hours leading up to night, but I would guess they just did normal stuff you’d do while camping. Now it’s around 1 AM, and since they were in the woods it was pitch black. You couldn’t see much of anything if you were to get out the tent to go piss or something else.

Around that time my brother had said he heard a light whispering. It wasn’t completely inaudible, but he couldn’t make out what was being said, or if anything was being said at all. At first he didn’t take any mind to it and went back to sleep. Around 2 hours later the whispering came back, and it was louder. Like almost it came from outside the tent. Both of his friends heard it this time and all 3 knew something was up. They were completely scared of the situation.

Their car was parked 2 miles away from where they camped at (or at-least he told me so). And since it was around 3 A.M now it was still pitch black. So it was either they stay in the tent and pray whatever was whispering was not looking for them, or they make a run for it to the car. They chose the latter. I mentioned earlier they brought pots and pans, and an axe. My brother grabbed the axe just incase they had to fight whatever was making the noise, and one of his friends (let’s call him John) grabbed the pots and pans. My brother’ and John’s phones were dead, but friend #2 (let’s call him Joey) phone still had about 10% of battery. They planned to lock arms in form sort of a triangle facing towards the trees. John started banging the pots and pans in hope of scaring the thing away, Joey used his phone as a flash light, and my brother prepared to swing the axe at anything that jumped out at them. In about an hour and a half they made it to the car and got the hell out of there.

My brother never knew what was outside their tent, but he theorized it was a meth addict since that area was notorious to be home of a few meth heads. It could’ve been a bear stumbling around in the night, or maybe a cult doing a sacred ritual, but he’ll never know for sure which is truly terrifying.
