The nurse guided me down the hallway of sterile lights and stopped at a door near the end. She gave a halfhearted smile, clearly pitying me based on what she knew about the situation, then nodded to the room before turning to leave. Through the glass to the side of the door, I could see her lying in bed, fidgeting with the band on her wrist and looking out the window. I had been so upset and confused the past few days, but as soon as I saw her turn to look at me, it melted away. At the end of the day, the only thing that mattered was that she was safe. Slowly I pushed open the door and slipped inside. She skirted her eyes to the bed sheets to avoid my gaze as I crossed the room and sat in a chair next to her bed. When she still didn't look at me, I grabbed her hand.

"Hey."

"Hey." She replied, her eyes already beginning to well up. There was a very long silence before she spoke again. "I'm sorry…." She whispered almost inaudibly. "I'm so sorry. Please don't be mad."

Now it was my turn for tears, "It's okay. I'm not mad. I was just so scared."

"I know. I'm so sorry, Joel."

I pulled her hand up to my mouth and kissed it, "You can't keep doing this, Rose. You're going to tear yourself apart. It kills me to see you do that."

"I know, I'm so stupid. It's just… It's so hard, Joel."

"I know. I know it is. But please, I can't lose you, Rose. Even if it doesn't kill you, I don't want to see this kind of life for you."

"You won't. This was the last straw. No more, I promise."

"You promise?"

"I promise."

"One more time."

"I promise, Joel."

I stared into her piercing blue eyes. They were full of fear and tears. I had been through this conversation so many times before and heard the words as if there were a song on repeat. The term 'promise' meant nothing at this point, yet I had convinced myself that if I could just get her to say it enough times, it might regain its importance.

"Okay," I told her. "Okay."

I crawled onto the edge of the bed and wrapped my arms around her as she nestled in close and held on tight. Her embrace was honest and full of love, and her skin was warm and reassuring. The world was wrong. So so wrong. But holding Rose, that was the one thing I knew was right.  
  
Holding Bea, that was the one thing I knew was right.  
  
Holding Andi, that was the one thing I knew was right.  
  
Holding Sarah, that was the one thing-  
  
Her razor-sharp nails were wormed under my skin, dripping endless blood from where they burrowed. I thought surely I'd bleed out after a few days, but I didn't. Blood kept flowing and time kept winding, but I stopped counting. All the while, she whispered chills into my ears with her fridged breath.

"I'm so happy we're finally together, baby. I've waited soooo long." She cooed.

With the free hand that wasn't skin deep in mine, she stroked my hair and caressed my cheeks. Occasionally she would kiss me repeatedly with her dry, cracked lips or pull me into... affection... that would last for hours, but I never fought it. There was no point. I had nowhere to run. I had no strength to fight. Everything was a haze that blurred together, with only small thoughts drifting through my head from time to time.

Ethan was dead.

Daniel and Bea might be dead.

Andi was dead. She was killed by lacerations. Cuts that were fine and effortless. Just like the ones that the nails were nested in. I stared at the bloodstains on the fake grass that led into darkness as She whispered in my ear.

"I had to kill her, baby." She told me, planting another icy kiss on my lips, "I'm the only girl for you."  
  
As we walked down the mucky, leaf-covered driveway, the trees rustled in the autumn breeze around us. The gentle ambiance was quickly drowned out, though, by the sound of the ongoing party in the old plastic slatted house ahead. The bass from the music blaring rattled both my teeth and the exterior of the old rickety structure. The smell of cheap perfume and aerosol cologne leaked from its seems, and inside, I could see dozens of people twisting their bodies to the music, clearly already drunk. I hated parties. I hated them, and this was the last place on earth I wanted to be. I could already feel a headache worming its way into my skull when Rose squeezed my hand.

"Hey, we don't have to go if you don't want to. We can go do something else." She said with a sympathetic smile.

"It's okay," I told her, mustering a smile back, "I think we're a little too old for trick or treating. Besides, we already told everyone we were coming. I'm sure this'll be fun."

"Okay. But if you want to leave at any time, just let me know. I'll be right here all night." She said, squeezing my hand and pulling me into a kiss. Like medicine, the pain in my head melted away.

"C'mon, let's go. I'm sure Ethan and Sarah are wondering what's taking us so long."  
  
Ethan wasn't the name she had said. It was His name. Why did it feel like she had said Ethan?  
  
"Joel?"  
  
Maybe it didn't matter. They were similar in a lot of ways. Both were kind, selfless people. Both cared about me too much. I treated them both the same in the end too.  
  
"Joel?"  
  
"Hold your horses, I'm thinking," I said, furrowing my brow.

"Sorry, Joel. I think he's got you beat." Andi teased, leaning on my shoulder with a slight chuckle.

"Yeah," I sighed, flicking my game piece over, "I think you're right."

"Say goodbye to your gummy worms, my friend." Ethan taunted.

"Yeah, yeah, enjoy them while you got em'. I'm sure Bea will win them off you somehow anyway."

He laughed. "Hey, speaking of which, where'd she go?"

"She told me she was going to go read in the bedroom for a bit," Andi told him. She flirtatiously raised an eyebrow, "She's all alone in there. Now would be the time to make your move."

Ethan's face changed to red in an instant at the sentence. "W-what are you implying?"

Andi rolled her eyes, "Oh my gosh, Ethan, are you ever going to tell her?"

"Would you keep quiet! You know how small this house is!"

"Well, when you talk that loud, the whole world's gonna hear you, kid," Daniel called from the living room. Ethan folded into himself and lowered his voice.

"She doesn't like me like that anyways. And even if she did, there's not much room to date in this place. I mean, look at how cramped we all are."

"Yeah, I guess that's true. What idiot would want to date in this place?" I asked, looking at Andi.

"I'm not sure." She responded. "Probably only crazy people."

"You guys are crazy. That's why you make it work."

"Jan and Mark aren't crazy, and they make it work."

Without a word, Jan leaned in from the dining room and glared at me, making a 'zip it' gesture with her hand. I snickered back.

"Look, can we just move on from this conversation?" Ethan asked in a hushed tone. "Now go get my gummy worms, peasant."

I kissed Andi's head as I stood and smiled, "As you wish, my lord."  
  
I walked into the kitchen and came back out holding three beers as I made my way back to the circle of friends in the living room. As I moved, the sounds and smells of the party overwhelmed my pounding head, and the air felt thick and hot like magma. I stepped back into the ring and passed the cold bottles out to Him, Sarah, and Rose.

"Aw, what? You didn't grab one for yourself, Joel?" Another classmate of ours called out.

I forced a smile, "Nah, not tonight. I'm DD'ing."

"Boo!" Sarah laughed. "Everyone's just gonna crash here tonight anyway. Go grab one!"

Everyone joined in on the barrage of encouragement all at once, their voices echoing in my ear like a piercing ring. I looked down to Rose, who just looked back with a face of concern and an uneasy smile.

"Um, Maybe later, I will. It's still early after all." I laughed nervously.

That seemed to quell the audience enough for me to sit back down. As I did, Rose immediately wrapped her arm around mine. Warm and secure.

He leaned over next to me and whispered, "Don't worry, Brother, I'll down this one fast, and you can hang on to the bottle. Just pour some water in it or something. No one will ever know."

I chuckled, "I'd probably wanna wash it out first, or it'll just taste like piss water."

"That's just Bud Light at that point."

Suddenly a girl across the room called out over to Rose, beckoning for her to join them.

"Oh shoot, it's Mckayla! I haven't seen her since she moved. I'm gonna go say hi!" She exclaimed, jumping to her feet and beginning to make her way over. However, as she did, I caught her wrist and looked at her with concern. She looked at me for a moment as if caught off guard, and her expression went more gentle, "It's okay, Joel. I'll be back quickly, I promise."

I stared her down, holding my same expression, but I just couldn't resist her eyes. They were so gentle and pure, with a hint of hardship hidden behind them. I never wanted to be a reason she was upset or sad, so against my better judgment, I let her go. She turned up a smile at me before I watched her bounce happily over to the other group and embrace Mckayla.

"How have you guys been doing?" He asked next to me. "Have things been better since… you know?"  
I nodded, but my stomach began to twist itself into knots, "Yeah, for the most part. Watching her go through withdrawals was really hard to see; she was like a different person. Lately, though, she's been acting like herself again, so that's good."

"I'm glad she's okay." Sarah cut in, "When I heard she had OD'd, I was worried sick." I winced at her mention of the event. "I had been at the party, and she was so faded when I saw her; I was scared that it might have been too much."

"It almost was," I said, watching Rose interact with the partygoers and laughing. Even from so far away and over the blaring music and drunk screaming, it was the only sound I could hear. The sweetest sound on Earth.

"Sorry to bring it up," He said, trying to lighten the mood again, "I just wanted to make sure you two were doing okay."

"Yeah, no, we're doing great. She's doing great." I told them with a smile that hid my anxieties. I turned back to the girl I loved just in time to see her friends gesture somewhere down the hall, beckoning for her to follow. She did so without looking back. As soon as she disappeared into the crowd, the party's ambiance began to drill into my skull. The bass from the overbearing music rattled my brain, and the laughter of everyone around me sounded like nails on a chalkboard. The smells and flashing lights made me feel nauseous.

A friend next to me took a big swig from a bottle of vodka and then passed it over to me, "You sure you ain't drinking tonight, Joel?" He slurred as he sloshed the bottle in my face. I checked the hall one last time, hoping that I might see Rose making her way back, but when she didn't, and the knot in my stomach was too tight, I grabbed the bottle's neck.  
  
"Actually, I changed my mind."  
  
"To what?"

"Potatoes."

"Potatoes? Why?"

"Think about how many possibilities there are. French fries, mashed potatoes, just plain old baked potatoes. If you had to eat only one food for the rest of your life, it'd take a while for you to get sick of them."

Rose chuckled, "That's fair." She rolled over on the blanket and nestled up close, banishing the chilly night air, "Alright, your turn."

I thought for a moment before I came up with a question. "If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be?"

"Alaska."

"Wow, that was quick."

"I think about this one a lot."

"Why Alaska?"

"I've always wanted to live there since I was a kid. In third grade, my teacher had us do a project on a state, so I chose Alaska and instantly fell in love with it. It's just so pretty, the mountains, forests, and rivers… there's just so much nature up there and so little civilization. Maybe that's what appeals to me so much about it."

"What, the nature?"

"Well, sort of. That's a big reason too, but I mean the civilization thing. Just small towns and cities hidden away behind miles and miles of forgotten land. A lot of days, I dream about going there when we're out of high school. Just leaving everything behind and starting over somewhere new. Being forgotten with everything else and living a quiet life. It's not like I've got much to stay here for."

Her last remark stung a bit, and I silently said, "I would never forget you."

"Well, of course not. You'd come with me."

"Oh yeah?"

"Mhmm. If you think the stars here are pretty, I've heard that you can see the milky way over there. And the northern lights in certain places. We could go stargazing like this every night."

"That does sound really nice," I said, smiling at the thought. "How come you've never told me any of this before?"

"I don't know. I guess I thought it sounded dumb, or that I was worried you wouldn't like the idea."

"Why would that be dumb? That's not even that impossible of a goal, Rose. If we started saving up now, we could easily move out there once we graduate." I told her with confidence.

I felt her smile against my chest, "Yeah, I guess you're right."

After a pause, I continued, "You weren't kidding about me coming with you? You would actually want to start over with me?"

She sat up and looked at me like I had just said something really stupid, "Of course, Joel. You're literally the only thing that matters to me. I could lose everything in my life, but as long as I still have you, I don't care."

I stared at her and smiled, butterflies filling my stomach. "I love you, Rose."

"I love you more." She said, placing her lips to mine.  
  
Her kisses started off gentle but slowly got more and more vicious. She rolled on top of me and pinned me to the ground, assaulting my mouth over and over with her own. Her hands grappled at me, and as they did, her nails tore at my flesh, reopening the past cuts that had barely time to heal and creating new ones. How long had I been here? Days? Weeks? Months?  
  
Years?  
  
I couldn't tell anymore. I could barely recall why I was there. I knew why I was *there*; In that room with the thing that looked like Sarah. But how did I reach that point? There was the house. I knew the house. I was in the house. I remembered hills and a yellow room, and I remembered leaving. Leaving for where? For what?  
  
To find something.  
  
To find something, that was right. Others had come with me too, but they were all gone now. People who trusted and believed in me. People I let down.

I left to find something, and I did. I did find it. But now, I couldn't reach it. Or maybe I could? I didn't remember. I knew it didn't matter, though. Whatever it was no longer held importance. This was my room. This was where I belonged.

She continued to indulge herself with my body as I lay helpless in her grasp. At one point, she pressed hard against me with a kiss, pushing me harder against the floor. As she did, I felt something jam into the small of my back. An object tucked in the belt of my pants, concealed by my shredded jacket. An object I had put there intentionally long ago. I needed it for something, I remembered. What was it for?  
  
Don't think about it. The House will hear you. There's still a chance. Think about something else. Anything else.  
  
Think about anything-  
  
"Shhh. It's okay. He won't know."

"This is still wrong, Sarah. I don't want-" Before I could protest further, she pressed her lips to mine again. As much as I knew I should refuse, I was starting to warm up to the feeling.  
  
No. Not this. Anything but this.  
  
She stared intensely at me from next to Him as he talked. I tried to avoid eye contact. I always got the feeling Sarah didn't like me.

"Dude, for real! Ms. Bleacher was crazy!" He laughed. The two of us were lightly buzzed at this point.

"Well, Rose likes her." I chuckled back. My joy suddenly faded as I checked the watch on my hand. Oh my gosh, was that really the time? The chaos of the party that the alcohol masked began to leak its way back into my brain, and the fuzzy feeling I felt turned to vertigo. "Speaking of which, I should go find her," I said, trying to hide the concern in my voice. I stood, and He must have clearly seen how lost I was as I looked around the room.

"Here, I'll come with you."

The two of us stood and began making our way through the house, scanning the crowd in each room like a where's Waldo picture. When we got to one room, we saw a couple of girls she had gone off with now talking with a different group. He made his way over and tapped on one of their shoulders.

"Hey, do you know where Rose went?" I heard him call over the noise of music and drunken rambling.  
The girl said something in return, but I couldn't hear it. I did notice He looked slightly taken aback by what she said. However, he quickly pulled back his smile and thanked her before crossing back to me.

"She, uh, she might have gone out back to say hi to some more people. They're having a bonfire out there or something. We should go back to the group, though. I'm sure she'll be back soon."

"No, that's okay; I should really find her, you know. Just in case."

"Oh, um, yeah. Sure."

As we walked through the hall and back to the stairs, He started to laugh aloud.

"what?"

"Nothing, you just look like a pissed-off old man right now."

I chuckled softly, "Leave me alone. I just hate parties."

"You didn't have to come; I know you didn't want to. Besides, we're still supposed to hang out Tuesday, right?"

"Yeah, it's all good. I figured it'd still be nice to hang out tonight. Plus, Rose really wanted to come. I didn't want her going alone, you know?"

His expression turned sour, "Yeah, I know." After a pause, he spoke again, "How long has it been now? Since she's been clean?"

I thought for a second, "I think about six months?"

He nodded but said nothing.

"What's wrong?"

"What do you mean? Nothing's wrong."

"Bullshit. Something is bothering you." I prodded.

He looked off through the kitchen and to the back door, "I just think we should go back to the group, is all. Rose is probably just catching up with Mckayla still. She did move, like, two years ago? There's probably a lot to talk about."

My pounding and intoxicated brain finally picked up the undertones of his words.

"What did that girl upstairs tell you?"

He once again didn't speak. He just looked at me with an expression that he knew I would understand. My heart began to beat fast, and the pain in my head radiated stronger as I processed what to do next.

"Excuse me for a second," I said before marching past him toward the back door.

"Joel, wait!" He called, trying to catch me. It was too late, though. I was already out the door and making my way toward the fire. I parted through the couples and groups drinking on the lawn and stepped into the light. There I saw her, dancing and gyrating to music that echoed into the woods around us. As she did, she wore a big smile, bigger than I ever saw when she was around me. That was because, right now, she wasn't just drunk. She was with her one true love.

She bumped from person to person, laughing and spinning with them as she made her way in a circle around the burning spire. However, she went sober for a moment when she saw me standing there. Her smile faded, and she halted as people continued to sing and dance around her.

"Joel! Hey honey! I missed you!" the drugs said, urging her on. "Wanna dance?"

I didn't respond. I simply looked at her and shook my aching head with a look of pure hurt before turning to walk away.

That was when panic set in, "Joel, stop! Wait, please!" She yelled, catching my arm. Ahead, I saw that He had followed me out and was now watching the event unfold. "Joel, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, honey. Please don't be mad…."

At that, I turned around and looked at her pleading eyes. They were so hard to resist. Still, my anger kept me grounded.

"It's just acid, I swear. It's not even addictive; I won't- this isn't-"

"What else?" I said, cutting off her excuses.

"W-What do you mean?"

"What else, Rose? Ecstasy? Oxy? Benzos? You know that shit that put you in the hospital last year?" Now it was her turn not to respond. She looked guiltily at the ground. "Rose, I can't keep doing this. Do you know how scared I was? When someone called me and told me you had overdosed, do you realize how absolutely terrified I was? I didn't eat or sleep for days until I could see you and know you were okay. Do you know how hard it is to see you slowly give your life over to those stupid pills and tabs and whatever the hell else you pop into to body?" 

Tears welled in her eyes, and people were staring now, but I didn't care. My brain had finally snapped, and I snapped with it. 

"I care about you, Rose! More than any of the people who take that shit with you, and yet you always pick them over me. Why? *Why*, Rose?"

"I… I don't…."

"Then, in the morning, when the high has worn off, and everyone else who pretends to care has left, I'm always there to carry you home. Do you think I enjoy that, Rose? Having to see you hurting and falling apart?"

"Joel, I'm so sorry… I-I promise, after this, I'm done."

The word burned like a hot ember against my heart. 'Promise.'

"No." I cut her off gently, no longer having the energy to yell, "I've heard that too many times from you." Tears began to fall from my own eyes now as I realized how many I had caused in hers, but it was too late. The damage was done. I had already spoken my heart. "I'm sorry, Rose, but I can't anymore… I can't keep being the one to take care of you… Not if you aren't going to take care of yourself."

She stared at me, and I could see she was desperately trying to push past the fog she had let into her brain. She was trying so hard to think of something to say. Something that would make me change my mind. I knew she would find it eventually. She always did. So this time, before she could, I turned and walked away.

He greeted me as I made my way back to the house and put an arm on my shoulder, "It's gonna be okay, man. You guys will work it out tomorrow. You always do."

I wanted to believe him, but I didn't know this time. My head still hurt, and I was pissed. I needed to do anything I could to drown out the pain. As we re-entered the house, everything seemed to spin and pulse, and I just wanted to scream. The music was too loud, the lights were too bright, and it was too damn cold without Rose. I walked into the kitchen, found whatever I could, and then drank it to its back end. After I finished doing that once, I did it again. And again and again and again. I knew the pain of everything wouldn't stop until I wasn't thinking at all, though, so I drank until everything went black.  
  
From the darkness, Rose stirred next to me. I didn't bother to move. I just sat on the edge of her bed and stared vacantly at the glowing numbers across the room. 5:13 AM.

I felt her hand wrap around my wrist in an attempt to pull me toward her. It was burning hot, and her skin was clammy, but her touch was gentle and weak, begging for me to join her. Even though I was still upset, I obliged, not wanting to make her feel worse than I knew she already felt. As soon as my back was against the bed, she climbed onto me and lay her head just below my chin.

"Joel?" She whispered in a lazy voice. She was still coming down.

"I'm here," I said back, raising a hand and running my fingers through her frazzled hair.

"last night at Brandon's party, did I…? Was that all…?"

"Yeah, Rose. You didn't imagine it."

There was a long pause for a moment, and I felt the front of my shirt where she lay become wet with hot tears, "I'm sorry… Those things I said to you, I didn't mean that. You know that, right? That wasn't me talking."

"Yeah. I know."

"Are you mad?"

I closed my eyes and tilted my head back as my mind felt heavy. I wanted to be mad. I knew I should have been mad. But the way Rose clung to me as if she was afraid I'd leave, and the way she talked so soft like she was too ashamed to speak at all… I knew that she really wanted to be better underneath all of the poor choices she made. How could I be upset with that?

"No, Rose. I'm not mad."

"You sure?"

"Yeah. I'm sure." I said, kissing her on the top of the head. "You just need to stop, Rose. I don't like how you are when you're on that kind of stuff. It scares me."

"I know. I'm sorry. That was the last time, I swear."

"Shhh. Just go back to sleep. We can talk later." I whispered.  
  
Why did that memory seem so familiar? Where had I heard that said? It was long after that night, years later. When I was in the house. I was apologizing to someone too. Someone who I cared about, like Rose.  
  
Bea.  
  
The thought hit me like a wash of cold water, waking me up from the horrible drug I had been under. She was still alive, at least, we believed she was. 

Well, there was only I now…

I believed she was. I needed to find her still. There was another too. Daniel. And the others on the surface. I needed to get back to them. They were still waiting still; At least, I hoped.  


"What's the matter, baby?" The thing that looked like Sarah cooed in my ear. "You seem so upset lately…." Her nails dug further into my skin as she spoke again. "Is this all not enough for you? Am I not enough for you?"

"N-no," I forced out, "No, you are. You're everything I need." I told her, faking a smile. It was so much harder to stay composed now that I was thinking straight. Nevertheless, I needed to butter her up as much as possible, so I forced myself forward into a kiss. It was like pressing my lips to a lamppost in the winter. Maybe Ethan was right. Maybe I would die eventually. But he said the house would spell my death, not this creature. If I was still destined to die, I wouldn't let that happen until I finished what I started.

"I guess I'm just disappointed, is all." I pouted, tossing in another peck, "I have all this love for you, but it's just confined to this one room." I said, gesturing to the grassy lawn around us. In the middle of the area, a bonfire burned endlessly, this one devoid of any dancing partygoers. "Wouldn't it be so fun if we snuck out?" I whispered in her ear. "How romantic would that be? If we ran away together? Just you and me?"

She smiled a wicked grin and bit her lip before digging into me with excitement and kissing me a few more times, "Oh, baby." She moaned, "That sounds so enticing. But I don't know if my father would let us."

"He let you come out to find me, didn't he?" I said, trying not to focus on the implications of her statement. 

Her 'Father'?

"Can you still leave? Could you… Could you take me out with you?" I said between breaths of passionless affection.

Once she had gotten her fill, she stopped and stared intensely as she thought, her inhuman eyes analyzing my own. My heart pounded as I hoped she wasn't catching on. after a second, she smiled flirtatiously. "Let's find out, Baby."

We got up and walked through the darkness until a wall appeared with the door waiting.

'Please.' I prayed. 'Please let this work.'

She giggled excitedly as we walked, as if we really were young teens in love, sneaking out at night. She made sure her claws stayed hooked into my arm, though, not wanting me to get away. I inspected myself to make sure most of my other wounds had healed, as once I left this room, they were most likely not going to bleed forever as they had been. I couldn't afford to pass out right now. I didn't have much time.

When we reached the door, Sarah's image stopped, then turned to me with a smile, "How lucky, Baby! The door is already open for us!"

I looked to see what she was talking about and noticed a small stuffed bear jammed in the crack. Someone had propped it open, and it certainly wasn't the House. The creature leaned forward and threw the barrier open, exposing the familiar abandoned halls of the basement. With a little skip, she gingerly placed one foot through the door, smiled, then stepped fully through, still holding my hand on the other side.

"Alright, baby! Your turn."

She pulled me forward, and I allowed her to. My torso passed through the portal, followed by my hips, but the grass on the floor suddenly twisted upward and wrapped itself around my feet like thick twine.

The thing that looked like Sarah pouted, "Oh, come on, Baby, you can do it!" She dug in tighter to my hand and gave another tug, and to my surprise:

*Riiiipppp!*

The green blades tore free and fell like confetti to the floor as I stumbled through the door frame and into the creature's arms. She laughed and squealed with delight before unleashing a flurry of kisses all over my face.

"It worked, baby! It worked!"

I stared stone-faced for a moment before breaking into laughter myself. Mine was out of disbelief, however.

"Yeah. Yeah, it did." I quickly slipped back into my act and pulled the cold corpse tight to my body,

"Now, let's go find somewhere nice and romantic, Hm?" I asked, trying to get a read on how deep down we were.

She nodded eagerly and then slipped her blades deeper into my skin. I tried to hide the pain as I began to limp forward.

'Hang on, Bea.' I thought, 'I'm coming.'  
  
When I woke up, the music from the party was still playing, although the volume was much quieter now. I was thankful since if I thought my headache had been bad before, It was a million times worse now. I looked around the living room to see others who had joined me among the unconscious; among them were Him and Sarah cuddled on the couch. That's when my shattered brain remembered the previous night's events. I needed to find her.

I scraped myself off the couch and began to softly call her name as I shambled from room to room. There was no answer. It was possible that she had left already, but I knew she wouldn't have left without me, argument or not. I began to head to the backyard, hoping she may still be there. The hallway seemed to spin as I moved, and the waves in my head split my skull open and came crashing to the floor. Thinking was so hard. I just wanted to find her and get us out of there. Tell her that I was so sorry for yelling at her and that I know that I'm awful. That we would get past all of this.

The screen door slapped shut as I shuffled across the grass, the early morning sky just barely changing hues from black. Here too, in lawn chairs and porch swings, people lay sleeping off the alcohol and whatever other substances that may have found their way into their bodies. I headed for the mound of ashes where a bright flame had once burned and felt relief as I spotted Rose slumped in a chair, fast asleep.

"Rose," I called out quietly, loud enough for her to hear but silent enough to not disturb others. When she didn't stir, I moved closer. On the more intense nights of her usage, it usually took more effort to get her up and going.

"Rose," I said, stepping next to her. Still nothing. I knelt down in front of her and looked at her face. It was so peaceful and innocent. How could I have been so harsh to her? I reached out and shook her, but to no avail.

"Wake up, baby," I said gently, taking her hand. "We gotta get going." My fingers laced into her palm, but felt shockingly foreign resting there. She was cold.

My head cleared in an instant.

"Rose?" I said, firmer this time and with a more aggressive shake. She still didn't move. "Rose, wake up. It's time to wake up." The icy chill of her skin was the only response. My breaths became short as the shock wore off and panic took its place. She was always warm and soft, but her skin felt stiff and cold. So damn cold. Why was she so cold?

"Rose! Rose, wake up!" I pleaded loudly, causing a few people around us to exit their comas. Not Rose, though. She stayed sleeping.

"W-what's going on? What's wrong with her?" Somebody asked.

I didn't answer. I just shouted at them to call 911 and continued my begging. Over and over, I squeezed her cold skin and cried out her name, but she never opened her eyes. My hands were so tight around her wrists that I certainly would have felt a pulse had there been one.

"I'm sorry…." I told her. "I'm so sorry… Please come back, Rose; I didn't mean what I said." I lay my head against her freezing lap and sobbed relentlessly into it. "I'll never leave you, please-- just come back… I need you, Rose."

I lay there for a long time, people gathered around and watching, unsure of what to do. I lay there until the sun eventually crested the horizon, but it offered no warmth against the absence of hers. I wanted to lay there forever until I joined her in the very spot, but a hand on my shoulder from the paramedics shattered that dream. I turned back and couldn't look away as I was escorted out. 

I left Rose's body lying in that chair, but the cold never left me.  
  
I ran through the halls with the Sarah creature for a while, blood dripping from the holes in the hand she kept me held by. She giggled and laughed the whole time, eager to attack me once we stopped. I felt a strange pity for her, even though she was an abomination of my own creation. It wasn't her choice. The House made her like this. The House was to blame for all of it. I reached behind me to make sure the object was still tucked in my belt and held my breath when I felt it was. Everything was set. There was only one thing left to do.

We came to a stop at the balcony of some sort of corporate building. To my surprise, it was one I had been in before: the high rise where Bea and I had talked in the lounge below. Where she told me about her sister. Some of the anxiety I felt melted away as I remembered the moment. I missed her greatly.

"What's the matter, Baby?" The thing that looked like Sarah asked, "Can't wait a second longer for me?" She wrapped a leg around me and pulled me close, and I returned the embrace, hoping it would cause her to release my hand. It worked exactly as expected.

"No, It's just that I remembered something that I needed to tell you," I said, with a fake smile, baiting her in close.

"Oh yeah? What is it?"

I leaned in close, then whispered, "This is for Andi."

With all my strength, I spun her to my right and shoved her hard. I felt bad for her, but I felt worse for the girl I loved. The look of pure shock and anger told me she hadn't expected the move as she went flipping over the railing and crashed far  into the lobby below. Not even taking a second to see the damage, I clutched my bleeding arm and took off running. I knew she wouldn't stay down long, and I needed to do my best to get away. The problem was no matter how tight I pressed my hand into my shirt, I was still leaving a trail.

"Joel!" I heard her shriek with anger from below. Her voice was hardly sweet anymore. Now it was wild and venomous. "Where are you going, baby?! I know you didn't mean that! Come back, and we can work it out!"

Adrenaline propelled me forward as I forced boot in front of boot, not daring to glance back. The sound of vicious clawing and rattling told me I didn't have to; she was climbing her way back up.

Dammit. I had forgotten how fast she was.

I rounded a corner and began weaving through the next area, an old welding shop with pipes strewn about. I began clambering over them as I heard her call out again, this time dangerously close.

"Oh, there you are, baby! Why don't you come back? Of course, I'll have to punish you, but I could never stay mad." She purred.

At that point, I really had no choice. Looking back, I saw her in the doorway on all fours, one of her arms cocking outward at a wrong angle. She was still so fast, even at such a disadvantage. I tried to run forward, but tubes hoisted on jacks blocked my path. I dropped to my knees, scurrying under them the best I could, the gash on my wrist smearing blood all the way. Behind me, I heard her threatening nails clacking across the concrete, growing ever so near.

I burst through to the other side of the spools and began to dash for the door ahead when I was tackled from behind. Sarah's clone stabbed into my shoulders and pinned me to the ground face first.

She leaned in close to my ear with a smile, "Hi, Baby. You really hurt me, you know."

She began dragging me backward under the pipes with alarming strength as I clawed helplessly at the floor beneath me. All my nails found was smooth concrete.

"And since you hurt me, it's only fair I hurt you a bit, don't you think?"

Back down the hall we went, and I kicked and thrashed the whole way. It served to do very little other than cause me more pain. When we reached the balcony again, she flipped me over and smiled.

"Don't worry, though! Once I'm done, we can get right back to it! If you don't want to give me your love," She said, leaning in close to me, "I'll just take it."

*THWACK!*

Before I got the chance to learn what fate had in store, blood splattered across my face, and the thing that looked like Sarah looked absolutely shocked. As shocked as she could process, at least. The axe lodged in her skull prevented anything past that. She tried to will her body to turn, but could only muster a groan as she slipped off of me. She flopped onto her back and looked up at the figure who raised the axe again, then brought it down hard in the same area. I didn't look, but I felt her cold crimson streak across my skin. After that, all was silent except for the breathing of my savior in the dark.

"E-Ethan?" I stammered, my mind dizzy from adrenaline and blood loss.

They dropped down next to me, using one hand to inspect my wounds.

"I'm afraid not. Can you move? We need to get you somewhere safe."

I smiled weakly as I realized who the voice belonged to, "Alice… You're safe…."

She offered a smile back, but her expression was mostly concern, "Come on, Joel," She reassured, helping me to my feet, "let's get you cleaned up."
