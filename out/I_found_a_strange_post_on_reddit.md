PART 1: The Glitch That Wasn’t

Guys, I think I found something... and it’s not just a glitch. Hey r/EldritchHorrors, I’ve been lurking here forever—first post, though. I’m an IT guy, so I deal with tech breaking all the time: crashed servers, corrupted files, you name it. But last night, something happened that I can’t explain. I was doomscrolling (yeah, I know, bad habit) when I saw a post in this sub. The title was gibberish—just symbols like ~!@#$%^&*() smashed together. The body was worse: ASCII art that moved. I swear, the characters shifted on my screen, forming jagged shapes that made my eyes ache—like staring into a kaleidoscope made of knives. I blinked, refreshed the page, and it was gone. Checked my browser history, the sub’s feed, even my cache—nothing. I asked about it in a random thread here, but people just laughed it off: “Clear your cache, dude” or “Time to log off, lol.” I tried to shrug it off too, but I couldn’t. That night, I dreamed of a city. Not a normal one—buildings twisted at impossible angles, streets looping into themselves like some Escher nightmare. In the middle, there was... something. I couldn’t see it, but I felt it—a pressure, heavy and cold, pressing on my skull. I woke up drenched in sweat, heart hammering like I’d run a marathon. It was just a dream, right? Except now, every time I close my eyes, those shapes flicker behind my lids. It’s been hours, and I can still feel that weight. Has anyone else seen a post like that? Or am I just losing my grip? 

Comments: 

u/TechSkeptic: Bro, you need to lay off the late-night scrolling. It’s just a dream. 

u/LovecraftFan99: Sounds like you glimpsed the Unseen. Be careful, friend. 

u/DoomedScroll (OP): I wish it was just a dream. But I can’t stop thinking about it. Going to dig deeper, see if I can find that post again.


PART 2: The Wires Whisper Back Post Title: 

UPDATE: I found something on the dark web... and it’s worse than I thought. So, after my last post, I couldn’t let it go. That moving ASCII, the dream—it’s been gnawing at me. I scoured Reddit for that post and checked every corner of r/EldritchHorrors, but it’s like it never existed. Then I remembered u/LovecraftFan99’s comment about “the Unseen.” It rang a bell—something from an old forum I used to browse years ago. Last night, I booted up Tor, dug into the dark web, and started hunting. It took hours, but I found it: a hidden site called “The Threads of Zyx’thara.” The name hit me like a punch—Zyx’thara. The posts there described it as an entity, a thing that weaves realities together, threading time and space like a spider’s web. They called it the Unseen Weaver, and get this: even the Great Old Ones—like Cthulhu—fear it. They say it can unravel anything, even gods, with a tug of its strings. I should’ve stopped there, but I didn’t. One post had a link to a live feed. I clicked it. The video showed that city from my dream—twisting buildings, folding streets, and a shadow in the center that pulsed like a heartbeat. My router started humming, a low, grinding noise I’ve never heard before. I tried to close the tab, but my screen locked up. Then, in the feed’s chat, a message appeared: “Welcome, u/DoomedScroll. We’ve been waiting.” My username. On a dark web stream. I ripped the power cord out of my PC, hands shaking. I’m on my phone now, but that humming—it’s still in my ears, like the wires are alive, whispering. I think I’ve stumbled into something I can’t escape. Does anyone know about Zyx’thara? I need answers before I lose it completely.

Comments:

u/AnonWatcher: Dude, get off the dark web. You’re messing with stuff you don’t understand.

u/EldritchExpert: Zyx’thara is not a name to be taken lightly. It’s said that even Cthulhu trembles at its mention. You need to stop before it’s too late.

u/DoomedScroll (OP): I can’t stop now. I need to know more. I’m going to try that feed again, but this time, I’ll record it. Maybe I can figure this out.


Part 3: Threads of the Unseen

FINAL UPDATE: I saw it. And now, I can’t unsee it. This is it—my last post. I don’t know how long I have before... whatever’s happening finishes me. After my last update, I decided to livestream that dark web feed. I thought if I showed it to others, I could make sense of it—or warn you. I set up my webcam, hit record, and clicked the link. The city was back, but it wasn’t the same. The shadow in the center moved, growing, and I saw them—threads. Millions of thin, shimmering strands stretching from the shadow, piercing through reality itself. Each one tied to a different moment, a different world. Then I saw it: Zyx’thara, the Unseen Weaver. Not a creature, not a god—just a force, a paradox that wove and unwove existence with every pulse. My head throbbed, like my brain was splitting apart. And then, something else emerged on the screen. A shape I recognized—Cthulhu, rising from the depths, tentacles coiling, eyes glowing with ancient malice. But when it faced Zyx’thara, it froze. I saw fear—fear—in those fathomless eyes. Cthulhu turned and fled, vanishing into the void. If even that monster ran, what chance do I have? The screen glitched, and the threads reached out—through the feed, into my room. I felt them, cold and sharp, wrapping around my thoughts, pulling me apart. I saw myself—hundreds of me—living different lives, making different choices, all collapsing into this moment. I tried to scream, but my voice was gone. My vision splintered, and now I don’t know what’s real. Am I typing this? Or am I already woven into its web? Maybe I always was. Maybe you are too—just threads in Zyx’thara’s design. Don’t look for that post. Don’t dig into r/EldritchHorrors. And if you see that link, don’t click it. Once you peer into the void, you join it, forever cursed, forever Unseen. 

THE END

u/ConcernedRedditor: OP, are you okay? This sounds serious. Maybe you should seek help.

u/TechSkeptic: This is just a creepypasta, right? Right?

u/LovecraftFan99: It’s too late. The Weaver has him now. And soon, it will have us all.
