The day I invented the anti-colon, I felt like Newton under the apple tree. A revelation. A seismic shift in the very fabric of language. It looked like a semicolon, but inverted: a comma perched atop a period, like a tiny, malevolent crown.

I called it the anti-colon, because it did the opposite of what a colon did. It didn’t introduce; it negated. It didn’t connect; it severed. It was the punctuation of undoing.

So I wrote a lengthy treatise, outlining its uses, its implications, its sheer, breathtaking elegance. I sent it to Merriam-Webster, certain they’d herald me as a linguistic messiah.

Their reply was… dismissive. A form letter, really. “Thank you for your submission. While we appreciate your enthusiasm for language, we regret to inform you that your proposal is not under consideration at this time.”

They laughed at me. Laughed. I could feel it in the sterile, polite language. They thought I was some crackpot, some amateur scribbler. They thought this was all a big joke.

That night, I saw it everywhere. In the shadows of my bedroom, the pattern of dust motes dancing in beams of light through the window. It was a ghostly flicker in the static of the television.

I closed my eyes, and it was there, burned into my retinas. The anti-colon, a symbol of my humiliation, my rejection. It became the focus for all the resentment I’d ever felt, all the petty slights, the whispered insults, the crushing weight of my own inadequacy.

I started to see it in the real world. In the cracks of the sidewalk, the arrangement of leaves on a tree, the way a fly perched on the windowpane. It was a plague, a visual virus infecting my perception.

One day, in a fit of rage, I scrawled it on a notepad, the pen digging into the paper.  I imagined it piercing the eyes of the editor at Merriam-Webster, his smug face contorted in pain.

Then, a strange thing happened. My hand trembled. A wave of nausea washed over me. I felt a surge of… power.

The next day, I saw the obituary. The editor, found dead in his office, his eyes wide with terror. Cause of death: undetermined.

Coincidence? I tried to tell myself that. But I couldn’t shake the feeling, the cold, creeping certainty.

So I experimented. I wrote the anti-colon on a scrap of paper, focusing on the face of a particularly obnoxious neighbor, a man with a barking dog and a penchant for late-night lawnmowing. The next morning, his dog was found dead in the yard, and the man was babbling incoherently, his eyes filled with a terror that seemed to originate from the very depths of his soul.

It worked. The anti-colon, imbued with my hatred, my frustration, my utter despair, was a weapon. A weapon of pure, unadulterated negation.

I could erase. I could destroy. I could undo.

I started small. A rude cashier, a noisy moviegoer, a telemarketer who wouldn’t take no for an answer. Each one, a tiny void in the fabric of existence, a subtle erasure.

But the power was intoxicating. The feeling of control, of absolute power, was addictive. I wanted more. I craved it.

I started to see the anti-colon in my dreams, not as a symbol of my failure, but as a symbol of my dominion. It was a crown, a scepter, a key to unlocking the hidden potential of destruction.

I became obsessed. I filled notebooks with the anti-colon, each one a potential death sentence, a potential descent into madness. I saw it in the patterns of the rain on my window, in the reflections of the streetlights on the wet asphalt.

I know what I’m doing is wrong. Morally reprehensible. But the world dismissed me. They mocked me. Now, they will pay.

I’m not sure how long I can keep this up. The guilt is a constant gnawing at my soul, a persistent, throbbing ache. But the power… the power is too seductive.

I’ve begun to suspect that the anti-colon was always there, hidden in the depths of language, waiting to be discovered. It’s a dark secret, a forbidden knowledge, a tool for those who have been wronged, those who have been cast aside.

Now, I’m going to ask you a question. Can you see it? The anti-colon. It’s here, somewhere in this story. Look closely. It might be hiding in plain sight. Do you see it? Or are you already too far gone to notice?
