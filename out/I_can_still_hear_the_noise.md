I had never given much thought to the idea of ghosts and supernatural beings, until I met her. She was tall and thin, with a face that seemed to go on forever. Her limbs were long and slender, and her movements were so unnatural, I was sure she wasn't human. I had no idea who she was or what she wanted from me, but she haunted me every single night.

It all started innocently enough. I would wake up in the middle of the night to find her standing at the foot of my bed, just watching me. I initially thought it was just a nightmare, but it soon became a terrifying reality. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't scream. I was paralyzed with fear.

But then she started moving, contorting her body in ways that were beyond humanly possible. Her arms twisted and bent in unnatural angles, and her legs bent backwards. I could hear bones breaking and snapping as she moved, and I felt my own bones ache in sympathy. She seemed to enjoy the pain, her twisted smile spreading as she continued her movements.

One night, she was right next to my bed, her long face inches from mine. I could smell her rancid breath as she whispered, "I want to scare you." Her words sent chills down my spine and I knew I was in big trouble.

I tried to leave my house, but I couldn't find the door. It was as if she had trapped me there and I was at her mercy. My nightmares became even more vivid and frequent, and I would wake up to find her contorting her body in front of me. I couldn't take it anymore, and I sought out help from a specialist, but nothing worked.

The specialist told me that she was a vengeful spirit, seeking to scare those she deemed deserving. She had attached herself to me and I couldn't get rid of her on my own. The ritual he performed to banish her only made her stronger.

I was at my wit's end and felt like I was losing my mind. I couldn't escape her, and I couldn't get rid of her. She was always there, contorting her body in front of me, breaking her own bones to scare me. I was trapped in a never-ending nightmare, and I didn't know how to escape.

One night, she reached out to grab me. I screamed and ran, but she was always there, always watching me, always breaking her bones to scare me. I was never going to be free of her, and I knew I was going to be scared for the rest of my life. The crunching sound of her breaking bones still echoed in my mind, a constant reminder of my endless terror. But then one morning, I woke up to a completely different reality. The woman was nowhere to be seen and the terrorizing nightmare had finally ended. I cautiously made my way over to the bed and found her imprint still fresh in the sheets, and a residue of grime left behind.

I was both relieved and frightened at the same time. Was this just a dream or was she really that powerful that she could leave an imprint and grime behind? I decided to leave the house, to get away from her haunting presence and start anew.

Years have passed and I have never seen or heard from her again. But the memory of her still haunts me, the crunching sound of her bones and the feeling of terror I felt whenever she was near. I know she will always be a part of me, but I am grateful that she no longer haunts my nights.
