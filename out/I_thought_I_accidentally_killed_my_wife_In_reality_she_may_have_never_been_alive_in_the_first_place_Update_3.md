Before I say anything else, I want to apologize for my last post’s sudden conclusion, as well as its incompleteness.

Assuming everything went according to plan, last Sunday should have been a quick, five-minute pit stop. If my ancient laptop really started acting up, maybe closer to a ten-minute break from my erratic movements. The odds of me being ambushed in that deserted truck stop appeared comfortably low, so immortalizing the mining logs on the internet felt like a worthwhile risk.

As I pulled off the highway, I told myself that if I got to the fifteen-minute mark without a successful upload, I would call the attempt a wash and try again another day. No matter the outcome, it should have been a brief excursion.

Removing the key from the ignition, my engine’s crackling growl faded away, leaving only the silence of the vacated lot. I methodically scanned my surroundings for threats, but found none. There were a handful of LED lamp fixtures scattered throughout the area that caught my attention as they flickered on and off, randomly spitting out globs of yellow light that matched the color of the full moon's hazy glow overhead. Otherwise, all was still.

Cautiously satisfied, I grabbed my open laptop from the passenger seat. In my head, I repeated a new mantra, trying to keep myself grounded:

*Hijack Wi-Fi from the closed Starbucks, share the logs, and then return to the interstate.*

It wasn’t a complicated plan, and yet it still went awry. Five days later, I’m still not entirely sure how I missed the vehicle approaching. Some combination of sleep exhaustion and mental fatigue dampening my senses? Probably. Alternatively, maybe the God Thread swimming through my flesh obscured her arrival? Can’t rule it out.

When I finally noticed that car creeping up behind mine, my stomach dropped through my gut like a goddamn anvil. Every muscle fiber I have contracted, as if increased tension would actually safeguard my brain and heart from whatever flavor of violence I was about to be baptized with.

Knowing I might never get another chance, I typed a fragmented sentence, clicked the post button, and then slammed the laptop shut. Pivoting my torso to face the vehicle, I couldn’t determine who was in the driver’s seat. The car idled ominously, blinding me with its headlights.

I wondered if my life was over, and how that meant I’d never get the opportunity to say my goodbyes to Camila. That painful moment felt infinite. Cocooned inside rays of harsh light, boundless fear stretched and contorted each passing second into an entire eon of perceived time. Decades came and went as I braced myself for the gentle thump of a silenced bullet gliding through me, the promise of a hundred tomorrowless days written on my ruptured chest in blood.

Finally, my vision went black, but not on death’s account.

A car door softly clicked open as the headlights dimmed, and someone emerged. While I waited for my night vision to readjust, they were just a human smudge standing motionless outside a compact sedan.

*“Jack…is that you?”*

Recognizing the voice instantly, I practically threw myself out of the car, rabid with hope.

*“Camila! Where have you been? Are you hurt?”*

Initially, I felt waves of relief wash over me. When my pupils adjusted, I saw Camila. Blue-white eyes like arctic waters meeting my own. Wispy blonde curls rising over her collarbones like golden smoke. She looked flesh and blood, upright and intact - this was my wife, I thought. She was wearing *her* clothes, driving *her* car. Seeing her so full and complete inspired a sort of amnestic lovesickness in me. I had missed Camila so much, who she was before all of this, and here that version of her stood. Inundated by a sea of endorphins, I became drunk enough to forget.

As I embraced her, however, she spoke again.

*“Of course I’m okay! Why wouldn’t I be? Why did you want to meet here, anyway? Are you ready to go home?”*

The waves of relief soured like rotting meat, and I came crashing back to reality.

With my lovesickness now erased, other, nastier things found purchase in the vacuum that it left behind. Camila’s deflation. Maggie revealing that my wife was on loan to me from some organization related to my grandmother’s business. Her transformation. God Thread. The mining logs. The description of a young man’s bones torn from his body by threads of sentiment metal.

A living alloy, capable of changing shape at will.

I pushed her away, and she fell backward on to the ground.

*“Camila…tell me where you’ve been.”* I said, standing over her.

She genuinely looked confused and hurt by my actions. It stung seeing her in pain, but her fall caused me to notice something important from my vantage point, the collar of her T-Shirt creasing to reveal the top of her sternum.

The woman had no port.

No scar or bandage to indicate it had been removed, either. There was nothing but blemishless skin on the front of her chest.

This wasn’t *my* Camila.

*“Jesus, what’s gotten in to you?”*

She stood up, brushing some small grains of asphalt off her jeans. After a pause, she moved one foot toward me, which caused me to move several steps back in response. Seemingly exasperated, she tried appealing to me.

*“Alright, Jack, I’ll answer your question. Just...just settle, I guess. Well…I was sick today. Had a nerve flare, posted myself up on the couch. You called Maggie to see if she could help, which apparently she could, because I'm feeling better now, and uhh…well, you called and told me to meet you here a little after 10PM.”*

Her brow furrowed with confusion as she gave me an explanation of the events that led up to this moment, like she was realizing in real time that something about her memory was wrong. Tainted by something out of her control.

Like the fact that some parts were completely fictional, and the parts that were true occurred almost two weeks ago, not a few hours ago.

*“Wait, no…actually, you didn’t tell me that. You asked Maggie to pass along the message for you. When Maggie told me, I left to come get you.”*

My blood froze. Something about what this thing was telling me felt like a thinly veiled threat from my mother.

Not only that, but the mechanics behind the copy’s arrival felt like a paradox. The God Thread that I’m infected with is either acting like an implanted GPS tracker, or it can somehow relay what I’m thinking. Otherwise, how did this copy find me at precisely the right time, distracted and vulnerable to being cornered? I’m damn sure no one had been tailing me.

But here’s the problem - Camila’s already proven that she can use that God Thread to control my actions remotely. She orchestrated the punch that concussed Maggie, and didn’t allow me to leave my grandmother’s estate until I stole the mining logs. So, if that’s the case, why even bother to send this copy all the way out here to coax me back to Maggie? Why not just command me to come home? Does her control over me wane with distance, or is there something more complex going on?

Perhaps most importantly, does this mean Camila is working against Maggie, or with her?

I decided I could dwell on the “whys” later. Basically, it seemed like this copy could track me, but it couldn’t override my will like Camila could. An unproven hypothesis at first, but there was a simple way to test the theory, thankfully.

Softening my features, I produced a lie.

*“Hey, I’m sorry about that love - I guess I’m not feeling like myself. I can tell you more about it when we get home, yeah? I’ll follow you in my car?”*

A wide, affectionate smile flowered on the copy.

*“Sounds good, love.”*

We both entered our respective vehicles and began driving towards the exit back onto the highway. I let the copy lead. Right as it pulled off the northbound ramp, I slammed my foot on the accelerator and swerved towards the southbound ramp.

I did not need to fight for control of the wheel as I drove south, confirming my suspicions.

\------------------------------

I spent the next five days in the wilderness. Made my way to the nearest national park and drove circles through it, never staying in one place for too long. When I had the energy, I spent time contemplating my next move.

Leave the life I've made and never return, or make my way back home to confront all of this head-on.

After much consideration, I’ve decided on the latter. I’m going to find Maggie, which will ideally lead me to finding Camila. *My* Camila.

I’m about two hours away from my grandmother's estate - needed to make an important stop before I get any closer. If my plan is successful, I’ll post another update. If it’s not, this may be my last post.

Regardless, thank you for following along and keeping me company.

I’ve transcribed the last two mining logs below - the ones I intended to include at the end of the previous post, before I was interrupted by that copy. After reviewing it all, I believe I was correct in my interpretation of the poem’s underlines. Whoever placed them meant to hide a precise "reading order" of a few, specific logs. That said, it’s not exactly a message like I speculated in the previous post. It’s more than that.

When you read them in succession, they form a manual, as well as a kind of record.

Those five logs concisely explain where Camila came from, how she was created, and I can hopefully use that information to free her. I've also included a small segment of the log that directly follows the last of the five. You'll see why once you get to it.

(As a reminder: **LAL** stands for "Living Alloy", and **SSMC** stands for the Stella-Signata Mining Company.)

In any case, here’s to praying that my first ever surgery goes well. Never been under the knife, nor have I ever wielded one. The two shots of vodka I just ingested will hopefully dull the pain without rendering my fingers useless. Not sure how dexterous I will be after the shock from the taser, either.

But if I'm going to confront Maggie, I should probably remove the God Thread from my body first.

Cheers,

\-Jack.

***Contents:*** Personal Operational Logs

The anniversary of Afonso’s death has stirred something within me. At first, I resisted. Memories I thought I had repressed completely came flooding back with the turn of the month. I fought hard to cage them, and they sure as hell fought hard back trying to be freed. They were mercilessly incessant, knocking at all hours of the night, begging to be let back in from the cold recesses of my subconscious. I was almost successful at sealing them away forever, I think.

But when I least expected it, those repressed memories found a crack in my defenses. One morning outside the warehouse, a fateful breeze carried the scent of sea salt and citrus fruit through my mental blockade like a Trojan horse. The fragrance is unambiguously of Portugal - an olfactory coat of arms, emblematic of this beautiful country. Under its influence, I could not help but think of Afonso. Visions of him poured out of that Trojan horse once it was past the barrier, lighting my soul on fire in the process. His life, his passion, his death - the squandered potential of it all.

The only meaningful thing I’ve done in the last year is keep the company away from the LAL. Using the [mercury adjacent symbol](https://imgur.com/a/mercury-adjacent-symbol-4n6b6st) carved on my palm as a compass, I kept the SSMC's ships close to the LAL, but not close enough to actually capture it. Not too far away to the point where they’d think I’m sabotaging their operation, either. I maintained the illusion of a chase. A carrot on a stick that they’d run after but never be able to reach.

I had resigned myself to that hole of a purpose, too. But his memory pulled me out. His unjust demise revitalized me.

In the end, despite the pain, I am grateful. When I finally gave in, it was like imperceptible jumper cables crossed the impossible distance that lies between the void and my body. From somewhere beyond, Afonso clipped them to my heart, flipped a switch, and jolted me awake.

I realized that, at best, my interference was a temporary fix to a much more complicated problem. If I wanted to stop the SSMC indefinitely, I would need to get ahead of them somehow. Learn more about the LAL in secret. Find something that would give me a broader view of what was going on.

Figured town would be a good place to start. They’ve known about the LAL for centuries, just by a different name.

*Marrow Drinkers.*

\------------------------------

It took only a week to find what I was searching for. Most of the locals were unwilling to speak to me, let alone help me find a resource on the Marrow Drinkers. My attempts at Portuguese only elicited a seething rage that was pervasive among the islanders. After what the SSMC had done, it wasn't unexpected. I was running out of people to ask when I walked into the small inn on the edge of town opposite to base camp, though.

The elderly innkeeper was the first one to smile at me when I pleaded with her for any information she had on the local legends, specifically Marrow Drinkers. As I spoke, she retrieved a leatherbound tome from the top of a bookcase behind the counter, its maroon casing weathered and wrinkled from decades of use.

Emblazoned on the cover in silver wire, the title read: *Anjos Caídos da Luz Violeta: Uma História dos Bebedores de Medula e sua Alquimia.*

Rough translation: “*Fallen Angels of The Violet Light: A History of Marrow Drinkers and their Alchemy.*”

She told me I could not take the book with me, but I was welcome to sit in the lobby and review the text over some coffee she was currently brewing, free of charge.

**The information I compiled from the text includes:**

\-Marrow Drinkers first appeared in historical texts around the year 1520, about three months after a massive volcano erupted off the coast of Portugal, fairly close to this island. Because of the fiery prologue to their arrival, Marrow Drinkers have always been closely associated with Satan/Lucifer.

\-In the beginning, their presence in local culture was not subtle. The book recounted many tales of massive, iridescent tides of liquid metal assailing naval vessels. Tentacles arising from the deep and splaying sailors open, removing their bones to harvest marrow in full view of their compatriots. These occurrences were apparently so prevalent that Marrow Drinkers even started appearing in art and literature from the time, [see below](https://imgur.com/a/NePrbyo).

\-Survivors of these attacks were known to go missing in the weeks that followed. In one instance, the wife of a captain caught him leaving their house in the dead of night, “possessed by the devil”. She attests that, despite her pleas, he walked half a mile to the shore and into the ocean, acting as if he could not hear her.

\-Before he lost himself to the call of the abyss, however, he had reproduced an all too familiar insignia - the mercury-adjacent symbol. He drew it on his nightstand, in his bible, even on the back of his hand. When questioned by the local pastor, the captain reportedly refuted the claim that the symbol was an expression of paganism or a demonic sigil. Quite the opposite, in fact. He told his parish that the God Mother, horrific and radiant, had visited within a dream to provide him a map.

*“Uma ferramenta para encontrar o caminho de casa.”* \- "A tool to find his way home."

\------------------------------

Overwhelmed by throbbing panic, I shut the book.

The last passage hit a little too close to home. Upon approaching the innkeeper to give it back, I saw that night had fallen. Translating the text was grueling work that required focus, but I didn’t realize eight hours had passed me by. I considered staying at the inn for the night. The streets were notoriously unsafe for SSMC workers, especially when they were shrouded within a starless night. Ultimately, I opted to walk home, not wanting David or Franklin to become suspicious of my leisure-time activities.

As much as it shames me to admit, I took advantage of that old woman’s generosity, covertly pocketing a few torn pages of *Fallen Angels of The Violet Light* into my pocket before I returned it.

I should have been more vigilant while making my way back to base camp. Maybe I could have prevented the encounter if I directed my attention externally rather than internally, but I found myself consumed by what I had uncovered. Then again, killing that man was the first domino in a very important cascade of developments.

It is what it is, I suppose.

The pungent stench of cheap liquor intermixed with fetid saliva slithered across my cheeks and into my nostrils before I even saw him. Turning my head to identify the source of the ghastly odor only resulted in a brutish hand conforming tightly around my vulnerable neck.

A tall ox of a man, delirious with drink, had decided to strike back at the SSMC by snuffing me out, apparently.

To my surprise, no matter how hard he squeezed, I didn’t feel myself getting woozy from oxygen deprivation. It did still hurt, though. I clawed at his chest and arms, but it became obvious that I had no chance at overpowering him. As my terror rose, however, a primal autopilot took over for me. My right hand found its way to the side of his face, and I pushed. Not with the muscles in my hand, but with the skin itself.

Eleven fleshy bayonets erupted from my palm and into my would-be assailant.

As they ravaged him, I experienced multiple terrible sensations in unison. A velvety squish as one needle mangled the jelly within his skull. A thick, earthy crunch as another exploded through his cheekbone. Whatever lies directly in between those sensations is what it felt like to wedge sharpened skin through the black meat of his pupil.

His life ended in an instant. In a sense, mine ended in tandem.

The dead man collapsed, face riddled with holes, causing monstrous thunder as his heavy frame connected with the hard ground. Once it did, I ran.

Although I could run from the scene itself, I found myself unable to escape its implications.

\------------------------------

You know, it’s funny. I’ve memorized all there is to know about the LAL. Every research paper published by the SSMC, every data point, every theory about its origin. Despite that, I’ve never asked *where* the original sample is. I mean, they wouldn’t just discard it, and none of the research I’ve been privy to mentions what the SSMC did with it. A huge discrepancy that I somehow perpetually glossed over.

Part of my programing, I guess.

I needed a way to prove it, though. What I came up with wasn’t exactly elegant, but it gave me my answer all the same.

There were a few false starts, but eventually, I found the courage to cleanly slice a pinky toe off of my left foot.

At first, I thought I made a horrible miscalculation. The stump seemed to be spurting viscous blood all over the floor. But as I looked closer, really focusing what was in front of me, the blood disappeared. No residual wetness, no metallic taste on the tip of my tongue. The fluid just vanished. Gone like it was never there in the first place.

Another smart piece of programming on SSMC’s part. They needed me to believe I was human, and humans bleed. So, if I was injured, I needed to perceive bleeding.

From their perspective, if I discovered what I actually was, I might elect not to guide them to the remaining LAL.

Inside my bedroom, I bent over and picked up my pinky toe, placing the tiny appendage delicately at the center of my wooden desk. As time passed, its defining features melted away into a homogenous, iridescent puddle. Once disconnected from me, it only took a few minutes for the flesh to return to its natural form, a boiling mermaid scale bubbling helplessly on the surface of the desk.

Giving me the name “Danica” was a cute touch, I’ll give them that. It’s the Slavic word for “morning star”, which is another name for Lucifer. An inside joke for David and Franklin's benefit, no doubt. Maybe it's what they're giggling about under their breaths all the time.

Slumping down onto the nearby rickety chair, I let the reality of the situation really take hold of me.

I *am* the sample of the LAL discovered on that beach all those years ago, or I’m at least the consciousness that’s been stitched into it.

***Recent Insights:***

\-**LAL cannot breathe outside of water,** unless it has been modified (excised toe almost died once it wasn’t attached to me. Lives in my bathtub now. Small droplet of liquid metal, swims aimlessly all day. I’ve named her after the innkeeper who lent me the book - Camila)

\-**LAL cannot grow in the traditional sense**. I’ve fed Camila plenty of marrow, human and animal. It’s allowed her to modify her shape, but she remained the same size. Overtime, however, my toe regenerated. When I excised it a second time and placed it into the bath, the two pieces merged into one larger piece.

\-**I have two modifications**: an internal one (chest cavity, “shrapnel from my time in The Gulf War”), and an external one (wrist band, “epilepsy medical alert bracelet”).

\-I believe my internal modification **suppresses my ability to change shape**, but I cannot prove it.

\-My external modification **allows me to breathe above water,** and this is conclusive. When I take it off, I feel like I'm drowning, and I become weak. Additionally, the space below the bracelet is sensitive, and a different texture. Maybe that area functions like gills. Thankfully, unlike my internal modification, it appears to be detachable.

\-**Electricity is destabilizing**. When I ate Milo, Franklin’s second in command, he tried to jab at me with a cattle prod.

***Statement of Intent:***

Once Camila is big enough, I am going to kill Franklin and feed her his marrow. Then, using my external modification, she can leave the bathtub safely. Masquerading as Franklin, Camila can get close to David.

She will then bring him back here, and we will determine our purpose. If we have none, we will kill David and then return to the sea.

**One final note**: In my preparations, I have begun experiencing a sort of ominous familiarity. The sensation of having tread this path in the past, even if the finer details allude me. I'm forced to ask myself, have I been on this particular crusade before? Perhaps I have been made to forget, but, against all odds, managed to retain the slightest fragment of a memory. Some part of me that refused to be erased completely.

If I ever forget again, I need but revisit the story of my birth. The story I stole from Camila.

I am a fallen angel of the violet light, and violet is the color of my alchemy. I am one part the red, catalyzing fires of the Morning Star's Volcano, and two parts the blue, nourishing waters of my God Mother's Sea. The axe and the womb, the bitter spark and the forgiving wick. The falling star and the rising tide. 

An alloy made from a loving end and a vicious beginning. 

I am merciful unification. And my history, as with most histories, festers between the lines, praying for release.

I arrived on the island this morning via a small plane. Despite my line of work, I have a limited tolerance for sea travel. Debilitating seasickness. Always feel like I’m seconds away from falling overboard.

Beatriz, my new assistant, met me at the landing site. She’s a graduate physical chemistry student from the mainland. \[...\]
