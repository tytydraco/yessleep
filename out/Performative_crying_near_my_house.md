The police stood around the edge of my yard, shining their flashlights into the woods, trying to locate the source of the sound, which seemed to emanate from multiple directions. Crying. A woman sobbing in the woods. Judging by the volume, the source of the sound couldn’t be more than twenty meters from the tree line. Yet, the officers stayed put.

Three of them now roamed around my yard, corresponding to three police cars parked out front, casting the neighborhood in blue and red. A siren in the distance heralded the arrival of a fourth car. On slow nights, everyone wants to see what’s going on.

At 8pm, I had been enjoying a beer on my back porch. Shortly after sunset, I heard a woman cry for help followed by anguished wailing sounds. She was hurt or being hurt. Dropping my bottle, I ran in a full sprint toward the trees, coming up short at the entrance to a deer trail leading into the forest.

I was overcome with terror. Not for the woman, but for myself. My subconscious mind connected pieces faster than I could, and I found myself racing back to the safety of my home. It was with great shame that I called the police, unable to explain to myself why I couldn’t enter the woods and help the woman.

It was performative. Standing in my yard later, I could hear it clearly. The sobbing didn’t sound genuine. I didn’t know how I knew. I just knew. The police all agreed, and so I felt relieved when they too refused to venture into the woods. I had no reason to be ashamed. Performative crying sounds inherently sinister. This wasn’t cowardice on my part. It was survival instinct.

The police called out for the woman and got no response. Her sobbing didn’t change, and in fact, seemed to repeat itself. The only words were when the woman cried out for help. The third time I heard this, I realized I was listening to a recording on loop. Each time the intonation was the same. I began to recognize the patterns of the sobbing.

I supposed I should also mention the incident with the fox the previous week. The poor thing’s leg had nearly been torn off by a bear trap. But no bears lived in this part of Pennsylvania. I had found the fox while out turkey hunting. It wasn’t too deep in the woods, but was strangely far from a trail, in a thicket that made it hard to get to. Someone could fight their way through the tangle if they had the drive to, but I put the fox out of his misery at a distance. I didn’t bother retrieving the corpse. Nor did I report it to authorities, which I now realize was an oversight on my part.

It was the image of the fox in the trap that had flashed through my mind in the instant before I reached the tree line and sent me running, proverbial tail between my legs. Who would put something like that in the woods? There were no animals large enough to warrant such a trap. None other than humans.

Humans are smarter than most animals, though. For instance, humans don’t just eat meat they find lying on the ground. Humans can see through camouflage that most animals can’t. And humans can recognize the mechanism of a bear trap, knowing not to step in it. You’d need more than meat to lure a human into a trap. And the cover of darkness would help with camouflage.

I thought about all this as a fourth officer rounded the corner of the house and joined the others in my backyard.

The question then became, “How would one silence a human in a trap?” Bear traps are painful, and the cries of a human caught in one would be anything but performative. The neighbors would be alerted for sure.

I scanned the trees lining the yard and wondered who was really lurking within them. The only thing I knew for certain was that it wasn’t a woman in distress.
