The first thing that led me to the lab was the length of my tongue, strangely enough. She chose the number four, her favorite. Four inches, no less, no more. The document was taped under the nightstand.

The second thing that led me to the lab was that thump I'd always hear at night. She slows her breathing to hear if I am asleep and stands. It is followed by those thumps.

The third thing that led me to the lab was what was down the stairs. She would go down there so often, with those thumps of her feet.  
Bump, bump, bump.

There, waiting for me, were the rest of the documents in a wooden drawer. One, two, three, I counted them all. I was raised to count; my mother was a mathematician.

Sometimes thumps would have friends. Those metallic sounds the measuring tape would make as it stretched as long as my hair, some nights my torso or my legs. Data collection only she could come up with. They were all soft whispers under her breath that only visited when I played asleep. My mother's voice was scratchy. Her murmurs always seemed to scrape her throat, a result of the cigarettes that burned away years of her life. I would occasionally read the small words on those cartons of hers, noticing something funny. We are both made of carbon, and I suppose that makes me her living cigar.

She'd fixate on money. It was everything to her, as she was everything to me. My father would pay child support, and she would not work a day in her life. Food seemed to appear out of thin air, and I never went a night without dinner. It was what everything led back to; every argument stemmed from it. There would always have to be some money saved, she said. And to her, that also went for time. Though she had the fear of someone who owes it.

When I stepped foot into the lab, its lights hurt my eyes. I soon came to realize that these lights were what grew me, as if I were a sprout. There was a long white table, the home of jars full of liquid. The home of my true kin. It was revolting; however, she had made me with a steel stomach. I couldn't turn away, not yet.

The colors ranged from yellow to a frothy white, full of pink, fleshy homunculi. I had once been them. The sight rang familiar yet far, distanced by a long fold of time.

I carried off as many jars as I could. I have them with me. Every single one. My original plan had been to take her keys and drive as far as I could, but it ended abruptly with the flash of a small white tag tied to the lids of the jars. In my mother’s handwriting was a price tag. On every jar. They were expensive, almost shockingly so. But what shocked me more were the dates, most of which were late.

If they haven't come for her yet, by the time I'm back, I will be the last homunculus.
