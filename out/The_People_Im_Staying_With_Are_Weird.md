It started like most horror movies do, which makes me feel even dumber for falling for it. My wife, Emma, and I were driving in a really rural area, since we were driving to visit her mother in Mississippi since Emma was pregnant, and wanted to see her family before we had the little guy. 

And just like every other shitty 90s movie, the car broke down six hours into the seventeen hour drive. The last town we had driven past was over two hours ago. Our options were either walk for hours to the last town with an eight month pregnant woman, or sit in our car in the scalding heat with an eight month pregnant woman. I wanted what was safest for Emma and the baby, so I kept scanning for a better option. Sure enough, I saw something way in the distance. 

It looked to be a farm, which, while it might not be ideal, they should've at least had a phone we could call someone on. 

Together, we walked through the field, trying to reach the farm which seemed to be getting farther away. But Emma pointed something out in the distance. A person. We sped up to try to catch up to her. It looked to be a child, a girl, standing in the middle of the field, facing her back to us. 

"Hey!" I called out, hoping she would hear us and approach us. She did turn around, but just stood there, staring at us. To be fair, if I was a kid who lived in the middle of nowhere I'd probably also be wary of strangers. We finally caught up to her, and politely tried to ask her where her parents were, and if they could help us. She looked at my wife.

"Issat a baby in there?" She said, revealing her crooked teeth. She spoke with a heavy southern drawl, and it sounded kind of... off. As if she taught herself how to speak English.

"Oh, um, yes, actually, we have a little guy on the way." Emma said. She tried to be polite, although I could tell she was uncomfortable. 

"Is it too late for the baby?" She asked, and we were both taken aback. Maybe she could see the shock in our faces, so as soon as she said that, she ran away. We could now see she was barefoot, and from the looks of the filth on her feet, she had been barefoot awhile. 

Emma and I exchanged glances, but still, we decided to go towards the farm, since we had hoped this kid was just shy and her parents would be of more help. 

As we walked, we noticed strange markings in the fields. They looked weird, I couldn't tell you what exactly they were but they had a lot of pointy lines and straight edges. 

Eventually, we did make it to the farm, and met the rest of the family. The weird little girl we had met was Dolly, and her older brother, who looked to be around 16, was Silas. Rosemary and Ezekiel, the mother and father, welcomed us into their home and invited us to stay for the night. We tried to tell them we really only needed their telephone, but they looked confused, and told us they didn't have one. We did humour them a bit and stayed for dinner, and after a bit of back and forth agreed to spend just one night. They were all very kind, although, similar to the interaction we had with Dolly, just a bit eccentric. The same markings we had seen in the fields were hung up as signs around the walls. 

At one point I had to use the toilet, and Ezekiel, who seemed to be head of the household, had Dolly "escort" me to the restroom. As we were walking, she pointed to the cellar door. 

"That's where grampa is." She told me. 

"Your grandpa? Why isn't he up here for dinner, with the rest of us?" \\

"'Cause he's dead. His soul is trapped and we hafta save him." She said, and I honestly didn't have much to say to that. What the fuck did you expect me to say? 

"Here's the toilet!" She said, back to a cheery mood. 

That night, as Emma and I got ready for bed in their guest room, we both shared our concern about the strangeness of this family, however, we didn't have other options. We were in the middle of nowhere, no car, no way of communication, and it was the middle of the night. We agreed to at least wait until the morning. 

I woke up with a start. There was no way to tell the time, but I would guess it to be around 3 AM. I looked around, trying to see what had woken me, when I saw it. 

At the end of the room opposite our bed, eight eyes, glowing in the dark like little stars. Eerily, the only part of them I could see. The rest of them were blanketed in the shadows. 

The four members of the family were staring at Emma and I, unmoving. They didn't even interact with each other or react to me obviously seeing them. They just stood there like they were in some trance. What were they doing? What were they thinking? What were they planning? I got up, trying to politely ask them what they were doing. I was terrified, but didn't want to provoke them. I didn't know what they were capable of. 

Instead of reacting to me, they all, one by one, turned around and exited the room, silent. However, before she left, Dolly turned to me. 

"Your souls need to be saved." 

I didn't sleep after that, and instead waiting for Emma to wake up, so we could get the fuck out. However, at around 6 AM, we heard a strange banging noise. 

They fucking boarded the doors and walls. We were screwed. 

Emma ran downstairs to confront them while I tried to find another way out of here. I can't lie, as I was doing this I eavesdropped a little bit. 

What was chilling is that everyone she talked to acted like nothing was amiss. The first person she saw was Silas, who simply greeted her. I heard her raise her voice, but heard loud footsteps. I assume he walked away.

Then, I heard Rosemary nonchalantly offer her breakfast, to which there was more yelling. Rosemary had denied boarding up the walls and insisted that they were always there, and that we could leave any time we wanted. At this point Ezekiel had shown up to see what the fuss was, but before I could eavesdrop anymore, Silas suddenly showed up behind me. 

"Your Misses is a pretty little one. A shame we gotta save her soul." He spoke in the same way his sister did, like nobody had ever spoken to him and he was instead mimicking what his parents would say.

"Dude, come on, not cool." I said. "And stop it with the saving souls shit. I don't know what you're talking about." 

"Not everyone is born saved. Sometimes we gotta save 'em." 

At this point it had dawned on me, although I tried not to believe it. I knew one way or another, this family wanted to kill us. 

I tried to knock Silas out. I thought maybe I could take their kid hostage, and then they'd let us go. But before I could, he called out for the rest of his family. 

I don't remember what happened after that. 

The next thing I knew, Emma and I were tied to chairs, candles lit in front of us. The family, like they had last night, were standing facing us, staring emotionlessly. 

"What the fuck do you think you're doing?!" Emma cried out, to which Ezekiel stepped forward. 

"Don't worry." He assured us. "Your souls are to be saved and all will be over for you. All for His Majesty, who will reward all of us kindly for saving your souls. Even you. Your painful life is to ascend to the next plain very soon." 

"No," I pleaded. "Listen, do whatever you want with me, I don't care. Just don't take Emma. Or our baby. Please." 

Rosemary stepped forward. "Oh, but your child does not need saving. He will be safe with us and His Majesty, for all of eternity." As she said this, Ezekiel motioned for Dolly and Silas to get something. As they left, Dolly slipped something into my bound hand. A knife. 

"Listen, I don't know what you think you're doing, but you're not getting away with this." Emma said as I worked on cutting through the ropes I was tied with. Silas and Dolly returned as Emma and Rosemary went back and forth, with a full meal. They set it on the table in front of us, and Silas began shoveling it in my mouth. 

What I had kind of overlooked earlier was the lack of animals on the "farm." What was I eating? I glanced behind me to see the cellar door, now open, and thought back to what Dolly had told me, and my stomach churned. Silas shoved another forkful into my mouth as I gagged. 

Ezekiel and Rosemary cried out in joy. "He has been saved! Our last generation, his body has now been saved. And our new generation," Ezekiel said, eyeing Emma's belly, "Is coming home to us soon." 

Suddenly, I broke out of the rope, only to be quickly seized by Silas, who was stronger than he looked. The table had been knocked over though, and the candles on the table set a nearby curtain on fire. It was contained for now, but gave me slight hope of escape. 

"Goddammit, Dolly!" Ezekiel bellowed. "To the corner, now!" 

Dolly obeyed quickly, rushing to a corner and standing there, as motionless as she was last night. 

It looked like it was over. I was being held down by Silas, the house was on fire, Ezekiel and Rosemary were insane and were ready to kill us. Then, I saw Emma's eyes light up the same way they always do when she has an idea.

"You need my baby. Without him, you'll have nothing. No house, no new generation, you'll just die off, nobody left to carry on your bullshit legacy." She looked to me, tears in her eyes. "Honey, please."

I shook my head. I couldn't do it. There had to be another way. With new determination to save her and my son, I broke free from Silas's grip, shoving him into the burning curtain as he shouted in agony. Rosemary tried to get to me, but was stopped by Emma, who had gotten out of her ties sneakily, trying to not draw attention to it. She looked at me, crying. 

"I'm doing this for you, love. I'm sorry, I love you more than anything." She told me and, holding onto Rosemary in a bearhug, threw them into the growing fire as Ezekiel and I screamed in agony, both losing the loves of our lives. 

It was just us two now, and we both leapt for each other. We wrestled, both trying to avoid the ever spreading fire. 

"All this, for a stupid ritual?" I screamed at him, slamming his head into the floorboards. I didn't stop until he stopped squirming under me. 

He looked to me, his head now a bloody pulp.

"I...there is nothing. I was not saved." He said, before going completely limp. 

Now, the fire was unavoidable, and there was enough burned off wall I could theoretically jump to safety. 

That's when I remembered. Dolly. She may have been part of a crazy cult family who tried to sacrifice me to whatever they worshipped, but I couldn't leave her. I rushed to the corner, where she was still standing, smiling.

"Dolly, come on, we have to get out of here." I cried, trying to pull her away.

She whispered to me. "I was bad. Father didn't let me leave." 

"Jesus, just get out of here! We'll both die." 

I saw a tear run down her cheek, but she remained stagnant. "I was bad. I have to stay here until father gets me." 

I had to go, or else I'd die, too. I ran, hoping she was following me. Just as I jumped out of the open foundation, the fire suddenly got much bigger, almost  like an explosion. She wasn't with me. If she was still in there, there was no doubt she was dead.

I stood, motionless for a while, before I began to walk. To where, I wasn't sure, but I didn't really care anyways. Nobody would come to save me, anyways.
