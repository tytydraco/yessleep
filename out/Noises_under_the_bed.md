Ive just gotten off a long phone call with my uncle which was quite comforting as I haven’t
seen another person since last weekend. And I don’t even remember the last time I’ve talked to somebody. I live way out into the woods, nearly twelve miles, my home is surrounded by thick forest and dark tree lines all over the property.

I’ve just noticed my back door was slightly ajar, only a tiny crack, I must’ve forgotten to shut it fully. Still, I shudder.
I get a text from my uncle: “is everything alright? you seemed on edge.” “feeling fine” I respond. I glance at my battery-7%

I go to my room, unhook my bra, and change into my nightgown.

Just woke up and looked around my room to find my lamp on, I shut it off without thought. I check my phone and find another text from my uncle “it’ll be okay” weird, but I brush it off and try to sleep
Feeling restless, i get up for a glass of water. I note the time: 10:53 PM
Sipping my glass of water, I’m lying back in bed.
I’m listening to the clock ticking and the sound of my own breathing to try and fall asleep.

I’ve been breathing in and out pretty consistently for the last few minutes, I just stopped for a second to yawn and I swear the sound of breathing in my room didn’t stop. I could hear wheezy, staggered almost inhuman breaths come from under me, only for a split second as it seemed to stop as soon as I’d noticed it.
I was frozen, but the noise was so quick I could at least convince myself it was a trick of the ears. had to be. who else could even be out here?

The more I keep listening the more I keep hearing, the sound of someone shifting just came from under me, I close my eyes tight and convince myself it’s just the house settling itself.

I’m trying to remember if I shut the back door,
I know I wrote that I did but I can’t actually remember closing it?

I have to know. I slide uneasily out of bed and as my feet touch the floor I feel a bolt of fear course through me as if a gallon of ice cold water just got dumped on my head, I make a mad dash to my bedroom door on the other end of my room, terror pushing my every movement.
I make sure I turn on my bedroom light as I swiftly exit.
I see my back door. it’s closed, thank god.
I lock it and head back to my room.
I approach my room and slide back into bed quickly. That’s when I have a horrific realization. 

My lights are still off.
That realization is quickly followed by another just as horrifying thought, that if there really is somebody underneath my bed then they know that I know that they’re down there after my dash of fear. I think about calling the police, but what if there’s nothing? What would I say? I heard some spooky noises? No, if I was going to call the police then I would need real proof that I’m in danger, but I just can’t work up the courage to look.

So Im laying here, just knowing someone’s hands are about to slither out from under my bed.
I want to say something, tell them I know they’re down there, but I just can’t break this still and terrifying silence.
My phone’s battery is starting to get low now-4%

An idea crosses my mind, maybe a chance to get some proof I’m in danger.
I turn on my phone camera and slowly lower it near the bottom of my bed, my wrist feels like it’s about to be chopped off, waves of heat and chills course through me. I sway my camera back and forth before I pull it up to look at the video I took.
1% battery
I don’t want to look, I don’t want to know, but there’s no other choice.  
I open my camera gallery and I click on the most recent video, my heart beating like hell and my hands sweating. The video opens,
I see a large man lying beneath my bed, I drop my phone and nearly scream, I’m crying and trying with my full force not to start wailing loudly.
My phone starts lagging and I realize I only have a few seconds until it dies. Not enough time to call the police, I open my messages app and click on the most recent name in my contacts, my uncle. With shaky hands I write as fast as I can “Call the police. There’s a man under my bed” I frantically hit send and wait in suspense for it to deliver.

Just as my phone dies, I hear a loud “ding” from beneath my bed.
