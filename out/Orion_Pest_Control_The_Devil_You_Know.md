There was a roar in the forest that woke the whole town at approximately 1:15 am. 

Not long after my eyes snapped open, fully awake despite the hour, Victor called me. He only wanted the most experienced of Orion, not wanting to drag our trainees into something that could potentially be beyond our scope. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

I found Deirdre, who'd spent the night on my couch, staring out the window, face grim.

“It was a slaughter.” She breathed, eyes distant as though her mind was elsewhere. “The spirit of the forest is nearly broken.” 

Whenever she has these moments of foresight, she has advised me that it is best to simply leave her be, as awful as I feel doing it. She has assured me that she is accustomed to seeing such tragedies. Weepers can get violent if their premonitions are interrupted.

So that's what I did: I swallowed my guilt and walked out the door. 

As I passed by the other apartments, I heard confused voices chattering behind closed doors. Lights were on. The braver/more reckless residents snuck peeks between their blinds and curtains, hoping to catch a glimpse at whatever could've made the sound. 

When I arrived at the darkened trees, I asked for permission to enter the forest. There was no reply. 

*Well, that's not good.* 

Hesitantly, I stepped across the threshold of the forest. Still, nothing. It was quiet. Nothing disturbed the brush or the leaves. Even the wind held its breath. 

It felt different in the False Tree’s woods. Before that night, you could feel its eyes on you wherever you went. Could tell that it was listening to you. Scrutinizing you. Now, it felt far too open, as if the trees were endless, yet empty with no critters to occupy them. 

After traipsing through the darkness for a bit, there was finally a noise. The rustling of something approaching me through the fallen leaves. As I trained my flashlight on it, I found that the footsteps belonged to a dog. Right off the bat, I recognized the dog for what it truly was despite having only read about them, though to tell the truth, I *had* expected it to be more intimidating. 

Its white fur practically glowed as it sat politely on the ground in front of me. While it was a fairly big dog, its little wiry mustache made it look more like a dapper old man than one of the dreaded hounds of the Wild Hunt. What gave the animal away as a member of the Cŵn Annwn were its floppy red ears, stained the color of fresh blood. 

“Hi?” I said to the hound. 

It let out a soft ‘boof!’ and stood, looking at me like it wanted me to follow it, its red-tipped tail wagging. I obliged, letting the hound lead the way. 

While I was following it, the dog abruptly stopped, letting out a low whine. Next to it was a mound of brown fur. As I got closer, I was met with the sight of two, disemboweled coyotes, their intestines leaking red onto the leaves below them. Blood coated their muzzles. 

*Oh God. Poor things…*

The dog yipped, staring at me expectantly. Time to keep moving. Nothing I could do for the coyotes, now. 

We encountered more dead animals on our path. A scattering of birds of varying species. Robins, buzzards, blue jays, hawks, even a bald eagle. All gutted like the coyotes, glassy eyes staring at nothing. 

Briar's voice arose from the trees, “It's like this everywhere.”

Quickly, I turned towards where I heard him speak. He was crouched by a dead buck, tracing its antlers. For the first time since I'd met the Hunter, he looked solemn, kneeling before the deer in front of him as if grieving for it. 

The hound let out a soft bark. Eyes distant, Briar told me that I'd better keep following the dog. I didn't have to guess who the hound was leading me to. 

Eventually, I saw the beam of two more flashlights cutting through the oppressive darkness. They were illuminating the False Tree. Not long after, a lantern provided the area with a subtle pale glow, making the surrounding trees appear even taller than they had before. 

The smell of pine was overpowering as I drew nearer. The Shepherd of the Forest was small. It had shrunk down to the size of a child. It was crumpled down in the epicenter of the carnage, bark-covered hands over its eyes as its shoulders shook. This time, I didn't see any squirrels or birds in its beard. Sap leaked from numerous gashes in its bark. 

Reyna had lowered herself down to sit next to it. She didn't try to touch the False Tree or the poor, dead raccoon beside her. Just reminding the distraught Neighbor that it wasn't being left to deal with its misery alone.

The hound had trotted away, coming to sit next to what appeared to be a woman, at first. However, she had the same bright, intense gaze that Iolo and Briar had. The keen eyes of a Hunter. She reached down to scratch the hound’s ears as it guarded her. 

From my left, I faintly heard the mechanic's voice, speaking quietly in Gaelic. In the light of the lantern, I could see him on one knee before a dead black bear, similar to how Briar had been, gently stroking the unfortunate animal's ears. In sharp contrast to his comforting voice and movements, he was wearing the same murderous expression I'd seen from him that night that he'd chased me within an inch of my life. I held back a shudder at the memory. 

It occurred to me that the Huntsmen were giving funerary rights. They were treating those animals with the respect and dignity of fallen warriors. 

Before I could ask any of them about what did this, I saw it. A cookie hanging from a tree. I swore under my breath.

Victor came over to stand by me, confirming my suspicions, “Hag tried hunting in the Shepherd’s forest.” 

When the female Hunter spoke, I recognized her deep, husky voice instantly. She'd been in the church when I stole the ledger. “She lured two young ones into these woods. I've sent them home with one of my hounds. It will watch over them.”

That explanation made unfortunate sense. False Trees are extremely protective of human children, especially if they reside in close proximity to the Tree’s forest. False Trees have been known to lead lost kids out of their woods, or to show them where to find safe berries or mushrooms to eat if they're hungry. 

As such, the False Tree wouldn't allow for two children to be brutally murdered in its home. And it had paid a terrible price for it. 

Iolo approached the False Tree, kneeling before it, his tone just as delicate as it had been as he offered those poor animals his blessings. Reyna gave them some space, coming over to join me, her flashlight showing even more death around us.

She whispered to Vic and me, “They're discussing what the False Tree wants to do with the bodies.” 

“Whatever they decide, I'm going to offer Orion's services,” Victor muttered. “Clearly, humans aren't the only ones at stake when it comes to the hag.”

*If she can do* this *to a False Tree, of all things, what else is she capable of?*

Briar appeared from where he'd been giving last rites to the other fallen animals, waiting patiently beside the female Hunter, hands in his pockets. 

Iolo eventually straightened up, waving his colleagues over as he strode over to join my coworkers and me. 

“We'll be givin’ the poor things a proper send off.” He informed us. “There's a lone ash tree in a hill ‘bout five minutes north of here. Shepherd wants ‘em buried there. Best leave us to it.”

Victor replied, “It'll take a long time with just you three. We can help gather them up.”

Apparently, that was the wrong thing to say. The mechanic warned, “Now is not the time to try to get a debt over me, blue eyes.”

“I’m offering this freely with no expectations in return.” Victor explained calmly. “We’re here for the False Tree. No other reason. You can read my mind, if that'll assure you.”

He stiffened when the mechanic took him up on it, beginning to search his eyes. Reyna held me back from trying to stop it. 

Eventually, once Iolo found what he was looking for, he said, “Fine.” 

With that, I saw Victor’s shoulders relax as the Huntsman stopped digging through his head. There’s a part of me that wishes that the boss would bite the bullet and name him. Though, I understand why he doesn't want to be bound to the mechanic, so I haven't pushed it. 

His demeanor *slightly* less murderous, Iolo continued, “Shepherd gave us permission to pull the trucks in, provided we mind where we're drivin’. It'll still take some time, but better than tryin’ to do it all by hand.”

Victor nodded, seemingly completely recovered from having his mind read, “Sounds good.”

Gathering up the animals took a long time, even with all of us cooperating with each other. There were just… so many of them. 

We all had a job to do. Briar and Victor did the majority of the digging. Reyna, the Huntress, and I were mainly responsible for locating and loading up each animal. The hound was a big help in making sure that we didn't miss even a single bird or chipmunk. Meanwhile, the mechanic alternated between carting the bodies around and helping the other two dig. 

As heartbreaking as the entire scene was, it got even worse when Reyna found a skunk that was a spitting image of Fireball. She hid her tears well. I would've cried, too. 

By the time we got the last of the bodies to the ash tree, the sky was beginning to lighten with the impending rise of the sun.

Though we were all filthy and exhausted by that point (even the dog was flopped on the ground, panting hard,) we brought the False Tree to the ash and held a little funeral for its treasured guardians. It sat silently, the green glow of its eyes flickering like firelight. It listened as each of us offered words of blessings. 

The False Tree pressed a hand to its chest and bowed deeply, its booming voice deep with sorrow, “The forest will remember your kindness.”

I know that the forest’s guardian will need time to recover, both emotionally and physically, but giving its fallen friends a proper send off seemed like a good place to start. As I watched the False Tree make the journey down the hill and back into its forest, I noticed that it was letting itself grow tall again. 

In the days following the massacre, we’ve gone back to give it offerings to aid in its recovery. It's been three days and already, birds are beginning to sing in the trees once again. 

Once the impromptu ceremony was complete, Briar, who’d been slumped on the ground after digging all those graves, slowly rose to his feet, shocking Victor by offering him a hand up. 

Reyna and I exchanged a glance. *Weird.* Them being nice was *weird.* 

She looked helplessly at Victor, “We're not going into work today, right?”

He shook his head, looking as drained as I felt, “If the newbies have an issue, they can call me. At this point, they should be able to handle a day without us.”

“Do *they* know that?” I asked. 

“They will in a minute.” 

The boss didn't have to tell us twice. Sleep and a shower were in order. And ibuprofen. 

As we were all about to part ways, Iolo caught my arm, whispering, “I've thought about it. Talk later.”

He took off before I could ask when ‘later’ was. But at least it wasn't an outright ‘no.’ There was still a chance. I still had a chance at freedom. 

If I had been more aware, I would've thought to be nervous. Unfortunately, I was exhausted. My brain was short circuiting. 

When I returned, I saw that Deirdre was back to herself again, having recovered from her premonition. Naturally, when she saw the state I was in, she was concerned. I caught her up as best as I could before stalking off to wash off all the dirt and gore off of me. 

When I finally got settled into bed, she found her way in, resting her head on my shoulder. I held her close, snuggling her not unlike how I used to clutch my stuffed bunny as a kid. As we laid together, the warmth of her embrace and the gentle rhythm of her breathing eventually lured me into a corpse-like sleep. 

Pounding at the door startled me awake. For a brief, terrible moment, I pictured my father at the other side of it, muscles and nerve endings exposed. Deirdre let out a soft murmur, stirring but not waking. It took a second for me to calm down. To remind myself that the sperm donor was out of his misery, now. Another knock. 

Wait. It was dark outside. What time was it? My heart began to race as I checked my phone, discovering to my horror that I'd somehow slept for *twelve hours.*

*Oh, he's going to kill me!*

I sprang out of bed, scaring the crap out of poor Deirdre as I raced to answer the door, telling her quickly to stay where she was and to keep quiet. 

*Oh God. If he finds out she's here… she and I will both be in deep shit.*

When I answered the door, the mechanic chuckled, looking me up and down. I must've looked as flustered as I felt. 

Before he could say something, I blurted out, “I honestly just woke up. I’ve *never* crashed this hard before.”

While his tone and smirk were playful, I could tell by the tightness of his eyes that he was annoyed. “Stop your grovelin’ and let me in.”

*Act normal. Don’t be suspicious.*

I broke the line of salt at my door, letting him cross the threshold, hoping that he wouldn't question why I was so antsy. 

Iolo glanced at the book Deirdre had been reading, left marked on the coffee table, “Didn't peg you much for the ‘reading’ type.”

“I've been trying to get back into it.” Technically, not a lie. I just haven't been trying very hard.

Thankfully, he didn't comment further, making himself comfortable on my couch, “So, we gotta talk ‘bout your offer.”

“What's there to talk about?”

His eyes slitted, “I didn't invest all this time into you just to give you up now. But at the same time, the baker situation is bigger than our ‘lil feud. She's gotta go.”

“You're right. It's not just us being affected,” I conceded. “I want to stop the Cookie Hag before anyone or anything else gets hurt. However, that all being said, I can't just let you take me.”

He smiled, “Like I said, Fiona. I ain't lettin’ you go just like that. Looks like we're gonna have to negotiate.”

I swallowed, shaking my head, “I can't be a Hunter. I'm not willing to negotiate that.”

His gaze darkened, that grin not faltering. “I recall you tellin’ me once that you'd never sacrifice others to save your own skin. Seems an awful lot like that's what you're doing now.”

My heart began to beat harder not just from nerves, but from anger, “You're the one being stubborn this time. All you have to do is release me, then the hag is all yours.”

He sighed impatiently, leaning forward to rest his forearms on his thighs, his voice becoming chillingly soft,  “All *you* have to do is tell me what she's lookin’ for. And you best do that. Today is *not* the day to push me, Fiona.”

My mouth was suddenly, horribly dry. I swallowed, but it didn't provide any relief.   

With the state he was in, he wouldn't be receptive to a word I said. I needed some way to calm him down. 

Forcing myself to take a deep breath, I politely excused myself before darting to the fridge, feeling his gaze burning into my back the entire time. I had a few jars of fresh cream saved up, courtesy of one of the local dairy farms; in my line of work, it's always good to have some on hand. Though, with Deirdre visiting so often, I must admit that I have been going through them quicker than usual. 

As I grabbed one, I urged, “Before you completely shoot me down, just listen. Please.”

When I closed the refrigerator, I wasn't surprised to find that he'd pulled a classic slasher movie villain move: appearing ominously behind the door. Unlike the doomed characters in those films, I didn't freak out. Just simply offered him the cream without fanfare. 

The mechanic wordlessly accepted it, leaning back against my kitchen counter. I gave him a moment to open the jar, watching the dark expression lessen somewhat as he took a sip. 

At least that's one thing all Neighbors have in common, whether they’re Housekeepers of Wild Huntsmen. To quote *Inglourious Basterds,* ‘Attendez la créme!’

“Alright,” He said with a sigh, sounding less prickly than he had mere seconds ago. “I'm listenin’.”

I chose my words carefully, “I want to keep my mortality and my humanity. I don't want to be transformed in any way, not even into a Hunter like you, Briar, or the Huntress with the hounds. And *especially* do not want to end up like the crows. I want to remain exactly as I am.”

“That it?” He asked lightly, taking another drink. 

Steeling myself, I continued, “I also… don't want you to hurt the keening woman. The one I've befriended, specifically.”

He snickered, “You mean the one hidin’ in your bedroom?”

My heart stopped. 

“Yeah, I knew.” He said before sipping at the cream again. “Only reason why I haven't done anythin’ ‘bout it is ‘cause of that fuckin’ stone. That, and it'd be poor form.”

“We're here to discuss the Cookie Hag,” I reminded him uneasily. “That's what's important right now.”

“I know.” He replied coolly. 

He thoughtfully took another drink. 

After leaving me in suspense as he deliberated, he eventually announced, “I’ll let you keep your precious fuckin’ humanity. But you're gonna have to let the keening woman fight her own battles. I ain't budgin’ on that. She's had it comin’ for a while.”

I wanted to argue. I was terrified for her. But she'd told me the same thing as he did: to let her worry about him. To focus on keeping myself safe first. 

“That bein’ said,” He continued after finishing off the jar with a pleased sigh. “You're gonna keep training to be a hero. Like I said, I didn't do all this work just to let it all go now.”

He still wanted to make me a tool of the Wild Hunt. That wasn't going to change. But at least if I could get him to agree to this, I wouldn't have to worry about being forcibly transformed into something inhuman. Possibly even having my will stripped away. 

For the moment, that was the best I could hope for. 

“But to be clear, you'll let me stay human? You won't make me into anything else?” 

“Yup. As long as you make good on this promise to stop the baker.”

I glared at him, “You can't get anyone else to make me a Hunter, either.”

He smirked wickedly, “Alright, ya got me. Nobody under my command'll make ya into anything either.”

Tricky fucker. 

“And you can't call in any favors from anyone that isn't under your command. No involving anyone outside of your hunting party.”

He shrugged a shoulder, still looking entirely too untrustworthy, “Fine.”

*Am I forgetting something? What else could there be? He’s a bastard. He’s got to be up to something. God, why can't he just be an idiot like Briar?*

“So, just to outline everything,” I reiterated, a hand raised. “I will do my part to get rid of the hag, and in return, you swear that you and yours will refrain from turning me into a creature of the Hunt.”

“And the training.” He reminded me brusquely. 

My bedroom door creaked open, interrupting us. While the mechanic's expression didn't change, the air suddenly felt much colder as Deirdre appeared, her face drawn in concern. I stared at her with wide eyes. 

“What happens on Samhain?” She questioned. 

The mechanic's chuckle made me freeze in place, “Can't ever seem to mind your business, can ya?”

Deirdre, however, didn't allow herself to be intimidated, arguing, “She *is* my business.” 

He laughed again, shaking his head as he said sardonically, “Oh, bless your heart!”

Since he made it clear that he wasn't going to answer her *incredibly good question,* I doubled down on it, “If you're letting me stay human, then the Samhain deadline doesn't matter anymore. Right?”

He continued to gaze at her as if trying to determine the most efficient way to dismember her as he answered, “No, it still matters.”

“Why?” I demanded. 

“Because we're gonna have an unwanted visitor.” He gave me a harsh sideways glance. “And as you probably knew already, The White Son of Mist gathers us all to join him in a great Hunt that night. ‘Cause of that, I won't be ‘round to stop it.”

*Oh, here we go.* 

“What visitor?”

He then said two words that I truly dreaded to hear: “A Dullahan.” 

My jaw dropped. Similarly, Deirdre let out a soft groan, seeming to share my dismay. 

Yinz know the Legend of Sleepy Hollow? It doesn't do the Dullahan justice. While we (luckily) haven't encountered one at Orion yet, our friends at the River Kingz had the misfortune of dealing with one two Samhains ago. When it left Cuyahoga Falls, it took the souls of twelve victims with it, including one of their newest recruits. 

And now Iolo wanted me to fight one. 

Seeing my shocked expression, he smirked, “Still so keen on bein’ human? Dullahan’ll be a loooot easier to deal with as one of us.”

“*No.*” I said quickly. “I'll… *We'll* find a way to drive it off.”

His eyes bore into me, “You better.”

Deirdre furrowed her brows, regarding him suspiciously. “There's still something you're not telling her.”

Without missing a beat, Iolo casually replied, “Take off the hagstone and I'll be an open book, even about things y'all didn't even think to ask.”

I balked, “Absolutely not!” 

“Come on, *caoineadh*, ya care about her, dontcha?” He then asked with a devilish smirk, completely ignoring me. “You wouldn't just let her stumble into a deal with me completely blind, wouldya?”

*You evil fucking-*

Deirdre raised her chin obstinately, “You're right. I wouldn't. I have seen her suffer greatly because of you and I have no desire to see it continue.”

“Stop talking about me like I'm not here!” I snapped. “We don't have time for this! This interpersonal bullshit can a wait! We have a hag that wants to do God-knows-what to everyone and everything here!”

“*Anyways,*” Iolo started as if I were merely some child throwing a tantrum. “You take off that hagstone and in five minutes, I'll be the most open and honest I've ever been in my wicked life. Five minutes for me to settle the score with ya. That's all it'll take.”

Deirdre looked at me apologetically, pleading with her eyes for me to simply trust her. To let her help me. Even though it was coming at her expense. 

*I can't let her do this.* Wait. No. This is her decision to make. Not mine. I can't control her, even if I think it's what's best for her. She’s told me time and time again to let her handle him. She'd managed to trick Briar into getting some strange Weeper blood-depression. She knows Iolo's name. She's not completely defenseless. 

With a shaky sigh, I reluctantly nodded, hoping she had some sort of trick up her sleeve. 

Deirdre went back to facing down the mechanic, “There is clearly something you need to get out of your system when it comes to me, though I do feel the need to remind you that the consequences for killing me would be dire. Even for you, Huntsman.”

“I'll make sure ya live through it.” His callous assurance only made my blood pressure spike higher. 

“Tell me your intentions.”

He let the hatred he felt for her reach his eyes as he answered, “You've touched her heart. Only fair I should touch yours.”

Deirdre didn't seem nearly as shaken by his response as I was. She merely appeared to be resolved to whatever fate the mechanic had in mind. 

“If it's for her,” The Weeper muttered, delicately placing her hagstone on my kitchen table, next to Ratcatcher. “I am willing to sacrifice five minutes of peace.”

She then stepped out of the hagstone's range of protection, awaiting him patiently with her eyelids fluttering shut. 

The mechanic approached her slowly, glaring at her skeptically. He told her to open her eyes. She calmly replied that he was going to have to make her. He smirked at the challenge. 

It's hard to describe what happened next. No. I take that back. What I should say is that it's hard to *process* what happened. 

He simply reached into her chest as if it was made of cream cheese. Deirdre let out a shaky gasp as he began to caress her internal organs, his eyes not leaving her face the entire time. 

I was shaking, watching it. Watching her flinch as he squeezed her heart. I don't even want to know what that would've felt like. It makes me shrink inside myself when I imagine how unnatural and gruesome that sensation would be. To have his calloused fingers toying with my innards as if they were the strings of his banjo. 

He glanced nonchalantly at the clock, Deirdre clenching her teeth as he traced along her ribcage, the imprint of his fingers  visible under her pale skin. My stomach turned, I had to look away, feeling bile rising in my throat, gripping my sink with shaking hands. 

She still hadn't opened her eyes. 

“You're a lot tougher than you look,” He commented, sounding somewhat impressed. 

There was a terrible ripping sound as he suddenly withdrew his hand from her chest. He’d let her go early. 

Deirdre stumbled back towards the hagstone, feeling blindly, not opening her eyes until it was back in her hand. 

“Now that we got that outta the way,” Iolo’s bloodied hand gripped my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze, “I ain't fuckin’ around ‘bout the Dullahan. But if you really wanna keep your humanity, you best make sure the White Son of Mist never sees you. I can keep the ones under my command from tryin’ something, but what my king wants, he gets. I'm fairly confident he'd want you. And this year, my chapter of the Hunt is hostin’ him.”

Gwyn ap Nudd is going to be here, too. Great. Wonderful. Happy Halloween to everyone *but* my little corner of Pennsylvania, I guess. 

“And I accept the terms we discussed, Fiona. Now, you best tell me what the baker asked you for.” 

“One of your instruments,” I snapped, trying to jerk my chin out of his grasp. 

He didn't let me. “And how do I know you ain't just gonna hand what's mine over to her? It would be in your best interest, after all.”

“Because despite everything, you’re still the lesser of two evils,” I growled. “This morning assured me of that.”

As horrible as the mechanic is, at the end of the day, he's still a Neighbor. As such, there are rules he's bound to, though he's terribly good at bending and skirting around them. If the Cookie Hag has any guidelines to abide by, I don't know what they are. 

Yinz know that old saying: “Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.”

He sighed, saying, “Alright. We'll work somethin’ out.”

Clearly wanting to add insult to Deirdre’s injury, his lips then brushed against mine briefly before he released me, leaving a bloody handprint on my skin. 

“You two have a nice evenin’,” He said as he stalked toward the door, smirking as he added, “It was a real pleasure doin’ business with you both.”

Once he was gone, I instantly rushed to Deirdre’s side, needing to make sure she was okay. But how could *anyone* be okay after that? She was turned away from me, her shoulders shaking. Tears welled in my eyes as I seized her shoulders, wishing I could do something, *anything* to help her. 

Imagine my surprise to see that she was *laughing,* a hand over her mouth to keep the sound from reaching the Huntsman’s ears through the thin walls. 

Naturally, I was thrown for a loop, glancing between her and the door, as I breathed, “Am I missing something?”

She held up one finger, indicating to be quiet, still barely stifling her laughter. Still thoroughly confused, I rushed to the peephole, watching as another tenant seemed to either not notice or care as Iolo walked past her, hand and wrist still stained red. I waited until I saw the truck's tail lights halfway down the road before telling Deirdre that he was gone. 

When I turned back to her, her smile was mischievous, “I'm terribly sorry to not have mentioned this to you before, Nessa, but I wasn't sure how good of an actress you are. I didn't want to risk giving away my little secret.”

“What secret?” I asked, feeling a tear escape my eye. She gently wiped it away. 

She then cheekily whispered to me, “My time in the river dulled my senses. I didn't feel Briar's thorns. And I didn't feel a single thing that happened a moment ago. The Huntsmen can't harm me.”

I blinked my tears away in disbelief. “But… hold on…”

“It was all a show.” She explained. “But I had to make it convincing.”

Now that I understood, I was laughing with her. Hugging her. Relieved. So *so* relieved. 

“You really couldn't feel any of that?” I confirmed in disbelief. “It looked… it looked *horrible!*”

The Weeper continued to beam up at me, “No harm done. None whatsoever. I *told you* not to worry about me!”

Her kiss erased the one he forced onto me. I cradled her, stroking her hair, still utterly amazed at her. Even now, I am astonished at her ingenuity. 

That was when something occurred to me that was painful to consider. Reluctantly, I broke our kiss to ask, “Wait. If you can't feel pain, then… can you feel anything else?”

She looked down with a tinge of regret, “I’m afraid not.”

*Oh.* 

Deirdre continued, her thumb grazing my cheek affectionately. “Though, I still enjoy being close to you. The river may have taken away my ability to feel things physically, but my heart is still intact. Despite your suitor's best efforts, of course.”

Maybe that's why her hugs are so tight. She can't feel how hard she squeezes. 

She then added with a mischievous smirk, “And I must admit that I do enjoy using my  numbness to get the Huntsmen to do my bidding. What better way could there be to refute those that enjoy causing pain than to simply not feel pain?” 

Once again, Deirdre had the last laugh over the Wild Hunt. 

As of right now, the Cookie Hag hasn't attacked anyone else, human or Neighbor,  but I’m certain that it's only a matter of time. When it comes to taking her down and avenging the False Tree, Iolo agreed to meet with the boss tomorrow to discuss a plan of action. 

I’ll let yinz know the results of that when I can.
