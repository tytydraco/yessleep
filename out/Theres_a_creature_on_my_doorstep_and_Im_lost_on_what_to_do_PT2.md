Hello all,

We made it through the night. We always do. It's just taunting us, thriving off of our sleepless nights, our anxiety and fear. Between the screams and commotions, multiple cop calls that became nothing and general raggedy appearance of both us and our property, we are totally isolated from our community now.

I didnt tell anyone it was something paranormal at first, no mention of a skinwalker. I insisted someone or multiple someone's had targeted our house, as a prank, maliciously, I was unsure. People believed it at first but after police never found anything regarding evidence they started to become sceptical. I set up as many cameras as I could afford, which wasn't many, but it covered my side gates and front door. Never caught so much as a shadow. After the first month it was too much, I snapped and said the name, and that was it. After that I was the crazy guy. People on the street would bring their kids inside if I stepped outside, neighbours would wait in their cars before going inside if I was in sight. I'm assuming this is what it wants.

It had invaded my mind. Every thought, every dream, every moment, was wrapped up in if and when it was going to attack. I tried to get my fiance to leave, she's responsible for another life now, but she refuses to let me face it alone. This is real life, we can't just up and move, I have house repayments and it's in no condition to sell for anywhere near what I owe. I understand our lives are more important but unfortunately, what's life if you not only don't have money, but you owe $100k+. 

The more and more it stalks us, the more it's learned, the more it mimicks, the more coherent it sounds. If you really listen you can hear the distortion, but in a moment of panic, it sounds as good as the real thing. We've both learned this the hard way...

After the first time I decided to call the police, we'd already had several incidents and I just thought, for a moment, if I asked them to come silently, no sirens or lights, they might see it. I explained that this was a repeat occurrence and that I'd like to try and catch them in the act. They happily complied, treating it as a normal sincere call for assistance. As expected, they found nothing. It was just here when they arrived, scraping it's ungodly fingers along our bedroom window and speaking to us in our own voices, and as the tyres crackled down the road, it was gone. I hate how aware and intelligent this thing is. When the cops saw my pale, sunken face with black eyes and messy hair they knew atleast something had been happening. As I spoke to them, lying about the situation, I couldn't help it, I cried. I could barely stand so they sat me down on my driveway, "you have to help me" I said, over and over again, "I'm so tired"...

They patrolled the area for a while, suggested I invest in cameras and alarms, they were as helpful as they could be, but eventually, they had to leave. "Baby...come inside" my partner said softly from the doorway, and I did so, collapsing in exhaustion not long after. 

There wasn't another incident for 2 weeks, it was nice, peaceful. Figured maybe it'd had its fun and would find another target now. It got to the point that I cautiously, yet comfortably, sat on my back porch and had a late night cigarette before bed. No creaks, no crackles, it was nice. 

Towards the end of my smoke, I hear my love call out "baby...come inside". I was tired and something resembling peaceful, in other words, a bit ignorant of my environment as I prepared to go to bed. I walked inside and my partner was nowhere to be seen, it was odd but I locked the door behind me and headed to the bedroom.

My fiance was already asleep in bed. She awoke as I entered and smiled, a tired "hey baby" as I stepped towards the bed. "That was quick" I laughed as I sat down. She looked confused, asking what I meant. I commented how quick she'd fallen asleep after just asking me to come inside and her face drained of all colour. "I've been asleep for atleast an hour, I didn't ask you to come inside..."

It was in my house. It was in my house and I had played right into it. The second the reality of it hit me, there was a sound from my bedroom doorway.

Tap...tap...tap...like a long fingernail jamming against the door.

"You have to help me" I hear myself say.

It's clearer this time, the distortion I mean, now that I was paying attention. My fiance gripped my armed tighter than a small female should be able to. The pain snapped me back and I grabbed the large knife I'd purchased last week, borderline a machete. I dont know what made me think this would work, but I launched towards the cheap hollow core door and forced the knife through it. It found its target. The screech was painful, literally, my ears felt like they were going to explode. I actually fucking hurt this thing. I ripped the knife back through the door and there was no silent escape this time. The crashing and bashing through the house and out the back door was audible. I gave my partner another knife I had in the room and pursued the creature. Now I knew it could be hurt and to be honest I'm more than capable of handling myself. It was gone, but now I knew. That was a month ago.

Im not gonna waste more words on what has happened in the time since, you know what's happened from the scores of other skinwalker stories. More stalking and talking, more tapping and screeching. I've secured my house with more locks than a prison ward, and it seems to have worked. This thing is strong, but not stronger than solid steel deadbolts apparently.

Im going to kill this thing, some how some way. The biggest issue is its speed, it's stealth and it's strength, but its flesh just like anything. Nothing on here helped, most people either not surviving or escaping the place affected. I'm not trying to sound like a damn hero, but no one else is going to believe me, believe people like us, believe our scary stories, so I owe it to the next household this thing might target to just remove it from the equation. My fiance is heavily pregnant now and she doesn't need this stress. She's agreed to spend the next few nights at one of her last remaining friends places while I deal with this thing tonight. 

Im sorry if this story hasn't been as exciting as some others, but it's real, and it's exhausting. I'll update anyone who cares tomorrow, or I won't, if you know what im saying.
