I’ve never been good at talking about my feelings, so here I am, throwing this out into the void. I’m 19, and until last night, my life was pretty normal. I’m not sure it will ever be again.

My parents own this old house in a quiet part of town. You know, one of those big, creaky places with winding stairs and rooms that seem to go on forever. I’ve lived there my whole life, so the weird sounds, the random creaks, never really bothered me. I figured it was just part of the house’s “charm,” as my mom would say.

But last night, everything changed.

It was around 2 a.m., and I couldn’t sleep. I’ve had insomnia for years, so I decided to go downstairs to grab some water. I was halfway down the staircase when I noticed the door to the basement was open. That’s strange. We never leave it open. It’s always locked—my parents are really strict about that.

I paused, debating whether I should just ignore it. Something in my gut told me to go back to bed. But curiosity won. It always does, doesn’t it?

The basement light was on, casting this dim, yellowish glow up the stairs. I crept down slowly, holding my breath with every step. The air felt different down there—thicker, colder. As I reached the bottom, I noticed something that made my blood run cold.

There was a small door in the corner of the room. It was always there, sure, but it had never been open before. It’s one of those crawlspace doors, barely tall enough for a person to fit through. I remember my dad telling me as a kid that it was just storage, but I had never seen them open it. Not once.

The door was slightly ajar, and I could see something moving in the darkness beyond it.

My heart started pounding in my chest. I told myself it was just rats or something, but I couldn’t look away. I stepped closer, my hand trembling as I reached for the edge of the door.

As I pulled it open, the smell hit me first. It was rotten—like something had been festering for years. I gagged, covering my mouth, and that’s when I saw it. There was a hole in the floor, a deep, black pit that seemed to go down forever.

I heard a sound—soft, like whispering—and I froze. The pit wasn’t empty.

Something was down there. And it was moving.

I stumbled back, but before I could run, I heard a voice. It was faint, but it sounded so familiar. I couldn’t tell if it was coming from the pit or from my own mind, but it said my name. It said, “Clara.”

That’s my name.

My heart felt like it was going to explode. I turned and ran up the stairs as fast as I could, slamming the basement door behind me. I didn’t stop until I was in my room, locking the door and diving under the covers like a scared little kid.

I didn’t sleep. I just laid there, trembling, listening for any noise. But there was nothing. No footsteps. No creaks. Just silence.

This morning, I tried asking my mom about the basement, about the crawlspace. She went pale. She told me there’s nothing down there, nothing I should worry about. But the way she said it… her voice was shaky. She wouldn’t look me in the eye.

I’ve been sitting here all day, trying to convince myself I imagined the whole thing. But deep down, I know something’s wrong. There’s something in that pit. And it knows me.

I don’t know if I’ll be able to sleep tonight. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to sleep again.



Update: My mom just knocked on my door. She never knocks. When I opened it, she handed me a key. A key to the basement.

“Lock it,” she whispered. “And don’t ever go down there again.”
