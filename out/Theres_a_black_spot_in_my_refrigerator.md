There's a black spot in my refrigerator. I’m not a germaphobe, or have OCD, or whatever… but for whatever reason it's disturbing me. I had to pull out all of my leftovers, eggs, and half-used condiments from the shelf and pile them onto my counter. Now there's a desolate section in my refrigerator with a single black spot on the back wall staring at me. 

I scrubbed it with a sponge. 
Still a spot. 
I wiped a disinfectant wipe. 
The spot unrelented. 
I grabbed just about every cleaning tool I had and proceeded to assault the spot. 
The spot prevailed. 

I began to wonder what the hell caused this spot. Was it a prank? It couldn’t have been a permanent marker. Who’d take the effort to remove all of my food and reach all the way to the back wall of the fridge just to make a little spot to annoy me? I live alone with my cat, so I have no suspects. The entire interior of the refrigerator was impeccably clean except for that black spot. Maybe it's mold?

I looked up online on how to remove mold from a refrigerator. An AI overview gave me the following: “To remove mold from a refrigerator, unplug it, empty it, and thoroughly clean all surfaces with a solution of vinegar, baking soda, or a diluted bleach solution. Rinse and dry all surfaces, then deodorize with baking soda or lemon wedges.” Seems easy enough. 

Well, it wasn't really that easy enough. My refrigerator wouldn't budge. Step one was to unplug it and I'm struggling to just do that. So I figured “what the hell” and skipped that step. I grabbed some vinegar and baking soda from the cupboard. It brought back childhood memories of making a dumb volcano for class. Who knew you could use them together as a cleaning solution? I mixed them together in a spray bottle and it erupted everywhere. I frantically screwed in the spray nozzle with what little solution was left in the bottle. Hopefully this works. 

I walked back to my refrigerator and opened the door.
Did the black spot get slightly bigger?
I shrugged it off and began to spray the “classroom volcano solution” onto the spot. It started to foam up around it. I let the white foam linger for a bit as I decided to heat up some leftover pizza while I waited. I didn't want to put my food to waste. 

I grabbed a few slices from the pizza box and threw them in the microwave for a couple of minutes. As it spun around in the microwave I looked back into the refrigerator. The white foam turned black and appeared to harden. What the hell?! I quickly grabbed a sponge and tried to scrub it off. It had a weird texture to it as I felt it through the sponge. It resembled a hollow ceramic-like shell with hundreds of tiny holes around it. Almost like a really dry sponge or coral?

This is weird… 
I don't know if I'm just seeing things but it seems to be slowly growing. 

I really didn't know what to do now, so I decided to put the eggs and condiments into the bottom drawer of the refrigerator (the furthest away from the growing black coral tumor) and shut the door. It's 10:17pm and I decided the next course of action was to call some sort of specialist in the morning. 

My cat rubbed against my leg. It's his dinner time. So I headed into the cupboard and grabbed a can of food for him. As he ate, I began to stare at the refrigerator. 
Is it weird to have an ominous feeling from a refrigerator? 

I headed to bed. The refrigerator can wait until morning. It's not like it'll run off or anything.

As I shut my eyes all I could imagine was the black spot. My eyes seemed to intently magnify into it. A black void surrounded by a white emptiness. The refrigerator’s hum amplified into my ears. The void began to extrude like a foamy bubble. Little black dots spawn in a ring formation around it like ants or TV static. It began to spread as it spun in circles around the tumorous black growth. 

My eyes shot open. My hands in a cold sweat. I glanced at my phone. It was 12:58am. I turned on my bedside lamp only to see something that made me wish I was just dreaming.

My bedroom wall was breathing.

The gentle rhythm of my breathing synced with the subtle expansion and contraction of the plaster. It was a slow, deliberate pulse, like a hidden lung inflating and deflating behind the paint. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the eerie stillness of the room.

I blinked, trying to clear the sleep from my eyes, desperately hoping it was just a trick of the light, a lingering fragment of the nightmare. But it persisted. The wall, a solid, inanimate object, was alive.

Terror, cold and sharp, pierced through my grogginess. I scrambled out of bed, my bare feet hitting the cool wood floor. As I moved, the breathing seemed to intensify, the undulation becoming more pronounced. It was as if the wall was reacting to my movement, aware of my fear.

I backed away slowly, my gaze fixed on the unsettling rhythm. The black spots from my dream flashed in my vision, and a horrifying thought took root: what if the spot in the refrigerator wasn't just growing *in* the appliance, but *through* it? What if it was spreading, infecting my home?

My cat, usually a sound sleeper, rose from the foot of the bed, his back arched, a low growl rumbling in his chest. His eyes, wide and reflecting the dim lamplight, were fixed on the wall. He saw it too.

A new sound joined the breathing: a faint, wet scratching coming from within the wall. It was a delicate, skittering sound, like tiny claws dragging across a damp surface. The breathing quickened, and the scratching grew more frantic, more insistent.

I had to see. I had to know.

My hand trembled as I reached for my phone to turn on the flashlight. The light cast long, dancing shadows across the breathing wall, highlighting the subtle shifts in its surface.

Then, a small crack appeared. A thin, jagged line snaked across the plaster, following the rhythm of the unseen movement behind it. The scratching intensified, becoming a frantic tearing. More cracks spiderwebbed across the wall, and a wet, squelching sound emerged.

My breath hitched in my throat. Something was trying to get out.

The largest bulge on the wall began to darken, the paint seeming to absorb the light. A familiar blackness bloomed, spreading like ink in water. It was the same impossible black as the spot in the refrigerator, but now it was seeping into my bedroom, alive and growing.

The scratching reached a fever pitch, and with a sickening tearing sound, the plaster finally gave way. A hole, jagged and black, opened in my wall.

And from within, something reached out.

It wasn't a hand, not exactly. It was long and slender, the color of dried blood, with too many joints and far too many fingers, each tipped with a sharp, obsidian nail. It writhed and flexed, testing the air, and a faint, sweet, sickly odor wafted from the opening.

My cat hissed, a guttural sound I'd never heard before, and darted under the bed. I stood frozen, my phone clattering to the floor, my terror paralyzing me.

The thing in the wall began to pull itself through the hole, its movements jerky and unnatural. More of its elongated body emerged, glistening and segmented like some monstrous insect. Its head, when it finally appeared, was a smooth, black orb with no discernible features, save for a single, pulsing white dot that seemed to focus directly on me.

The breathing I'd heard from the wall now came from this creature, a wet, rattling sound that echoed the nightmare in my refrigerator. The black spot had found a way out, and it had brought something with it.

My stomach churned. I thought I felt the need to throw up, but my stomach was empty. My hunger pangs amplified tenfold, a gnawing emptiness that mirrored the void in the creature's gaze. It wasn't just a physical hunger; it was a deep, primal craving, a need for something I couldn't name. Its emptiness was contagious. 

The creature took a step, its multi-jointed limbs clicking against the floorboards. The white dot on its head intensified, and I felt a pull, a sickening invitation into the darkness it represented.

The refrigerator's hum, which had faded into the background, now roared in my ears, a deafening drone that vibrated through my bones. The black spot wasn't just in the kitchen anymore. It was here. It was in the walls. It was coming for me! And at that moment I remembered… I forgot the pizza in the microwave. 

My own breath hitched, mirroring the creature’s wet rattle. The air in the room grew colder, a deep, bone-chilling cold that had nothing to do with the late hour. The sweet, sickly odor intensified, now laced with a metallic tang that made my eyes water.

Another sound joined the symphony of dread – a low, guttural hum emanating from the black orb of the creature’s head. The white dot pulsed faster, and I felt a pressure building behind my eyes, a silent scream trapped in my skull.

Then, the refrigerator hum, which had been a background drone, suddenly spiked, a violent, erratic buzzing that seemed to vibrate through the very foundations of the house. The light from the open refrigerator door in the other room flickered and died, plunging the apartment into near darkness, save for the faint glow of my phone on the floor and the unsettling luminescence of the creature’s single white eye.

The creature took another step, closer this time. I could see now that its segmented body wasn’t insect-like, but composed of countless tiny black filaments, writhing and shifting like a living shadow. As it moved, small black dots, identical to those I’d seen in my dream, drifted from its form and dissipated into the air.

My cat, emboldened by some primal instinct or perhaps just desperate to escape the suffocating dread, darted from under the bed and streaked towards the bedroom door. The creature’s head snapped in its direction, the white dot fixating on the fleeing form. A long, black tendril, impossibly thin and fast, shot out from its body, snaring my cat mid-leap. A choked yelp was the last sound he made before he was pulled back into the darkness of the hole in the wall.

The white dot returned its unwavering gaze to me. The humming intensified, resonating deep within my chest. The hunger, the emptiness, became unbearable, a gaping void that threatened to consume me.

The creature took a final, deliberate step. Its shadow stretched long and distorted across the floor, engulfing my feet. The black filaments at its base seemed to writhe with anticipation.

And then, the pulsing white dot went dark.

The humming stopped. The refrigerator hum fell silent. The sweet, sickly odor vanished. The cold receded.

The creature stood motionless, a silhouette against the jagged hole in the wall. For a moment, a sliver of desperate hope flickered within me. Had it… stopped?

Then, slowly, impossibly, the black orb of its head began to rotate. It turned a full 360 degrees, the smooth, featureless surface reflecting the faint light from my phone. And as it completed its rotation, a single, new white dot appeared on the opposite side.

It was still watching.

And somewhere, deep within the silence, I thought I heard the faintest of sounds. A wet, anticipatory clicking, like something savoring a meal it had only just begun. The black spot hadn't just come out of the refrigerator. It had brought the refrigerator with it. And now, I was inside.

It’s dark and cold. My body shivering and my eyes welling up in tears. This has to be a nightmare. 
I blindly crawl forward as I reach around for my phone. My right hand’s knuckle knocked against something hard. A spinning light moved violently ahead of me. My phone!

I scrambled up to the phone and grabbed it. The shining light revealed a long corridor of white glossy walls. My phone still worked! My body shook as I crawled a few inches forward on my knees. I looked around me for any sign of the black spot. Nothing. 

I began to feel a slight vibration around me for a few seconds and then I heard a click. And now silence…
I frantically looked around me, swinging my phone light everywhere. I need to find a way out!

The silence was more terrifying than the humming had been. It was a pregnant silence, heavy with an unseen presence. The air, still frigid, now carried a faint, metallic echo of the earlier clicking sound, as if unseen mechanisms were shifting and locking into place around me.

The glossy white walls of the corridor stretched ahead, an oppressive, sterile expanse that offered no comfort or clue. They seemed to absorb the light from my phone, reflecting nothing back, making the passage ahead look endless and unknowable. There were no doors, no seams, no discernible features, just smooth, unbroken white.

I pressed my ear against the wall, straining to hear anything beyond the frantic thumping of my own heart. Nothing. Just a deep, unsettling stillness that hinted at something immense and dormant surrounding me.

My breath hitched as I noticed a subtle discoloration spreading across the pristine white wall directly in front of me. It started as a faint grayness, like dust particles gathering, but it was growing, darkening, and swirling in impossible patterns. It was the blackness, but diffused, like a shadow bleeding into the light.

Panic clawed at my throat. It wasn't just in the refrigerator anymore. It wasn't just in the walls. It was *here*, in this strange, silent place.

As the grayness intensified, the air began to vibrate again, a low thrumming that resonated in my teeth. The clicking sound returned, closer this time, a series of sharp, precise snaps that seemed to be coming from within the walls themselves. It sounded like locks engaging, or perhaps… teeth snapping shut.

The blackness on the wall emerged, forming indistinct shapes that writhed and shifted like ink in water. And then, a single, familiar white dot appeared within the swirling darkness, it's cold luminescence piercing the oppressive white.

It was watching me. Still.

The vibrations grew stronger, and the clicking became a rapid, rhythmic succession. The glossy white walls began to subtly pulse, mirroring the breathing I had witnessed in my bedroom. The corridor seemed to be constricting, the air growing thick and heavy.

I stumbled backward, my hand instinctively reaching out to the wall behind me for support. My fingers brushed against something cold and slick. I turned my phone light downwards.

Embedded in the pristine white was a row of small, perfectly circular indentations. They were black, impossibly black, and arranged in a precise, unsettling pattern. And as I watched, one of them began to slowly dilate, opening like a tiny, lidless eye.

More of the black circles began to open, each one fixated on me. The clicking intensified, and a new sound emerged from the walls – a soft, wet sighing, like something exhaling with terrible anticipation.

The corridor wasn't just a hallway. It was a throat. And the black spots… they weren't just spots.

They were waiting. And I was walking deeper inside.

Escape wasn't a concept that seemed to exist in this place. The smooth, unyielding walls offered no openings, no cracks to exploit. The ever-watching black eyes provided no hint of exit, only a chilling anticipation.

Desperation clawed at my reason, but a primal instinct for survival, however futile it seemed, took over. I had to move. Staying still felt like waiting to be consumed.

Clutching my phone, I began to run down the white corridor, the beam of light shaking wildly in front of me. My footsteps echoed strangely in the oppressive silence, each sound feeling amplified, as if alerting whatever lurked in the walls to my frantic flight.

The black eyes embedded in the walls tracked my movement, their gaze unwavering. As I ran, more of them opened, until the walls on either side were lined with rows upon rows of silent, black observers. The wet sighing intensified, a chorus of anticipation that seemed to emanate from the very structure of this place.

The corridor stretched on, impossibly long. There were no turns, no intersections, just the endless white and the countless black eyes. It felt like running on a treadmill in a nightmare, expending all my energy but going nowhere.

Ahead, the blackness in the wall intensified, swirling and solidifying. The single white dot pulsed faster, and the humming, faint at first, began to build again, a low, resonant drone that vibrated in my bones.

The corridor began to narrow, the smooth white walls pressing in on either side. I could feel the subtle undulation against my shoulders, the breathing of this monstrous place becoming more pronounced, more insistent.

Then, the clicking started again, closer than ever. It seemed to be coming from directly behind me, a rapid, rhythmic snapping that sounded like teeth grinding. I risked a quick glance over my shoulder.

The blackness on the wall behind me was extruding, forming a long, slender shape that writhed and pulsed. And at its tip, a single obsidian nail glinted in the beam of my phone light.

The corridor was closing in. The eyes were watching. Something was pursuing me.

Escape wasn't an option. Survival was a rapidly dwindling possibility. All that remained was to keep moving forward, deeper into the belly of the beast. 

My phone's battery was draining much slower than I thought it would. The clock says it's only 1:13am. Time seems to be running slower the deeper I go. Where was this corridor taking me?! Am I dead? Is this Limbo?! 

What I know for sure is that I can only go in one direction and that's forward. If I stop for long enough, I have the unnerving feeling that the pulsating black void will impale me with its lone long sharp tendril that's following me ever so slowly. Thank god I can type all this while I walk. 

I did have thoughts of calling someone for help but who would believe me? Even if they did, what could they do? What does my apartment look like? Had the moldy void consumed the entire building? The entire neighborhood?! 

I heard a meow coming from within the corridor. 

The meow was faint, a pathetic, drawn-out sound that echoed eerily in the sterile white. It was undeniably my cat. But how could he be here? Had that tendril not… ? A fresh wave of nausea rolled over me, the image of his small body being dragged back into the wall flashing in my mind.

Hope, fragile and foolish, flickered within the despair. If he was here, maybe there was a way out. Or maybe this was just another cruel trick of this impossible place, a lure to draw me further into its depths.

"Benji?" I whispered, my voice cracking. "Benji, are you there?"

Another meow answered, closer this time, seemingly coming from further down the corridor. I started running again, my fear momentarily overshadowed by a desperate need to find him.

The black eyes in the walls seemed to intensify their gaze, their silent observation feeling more predatory now. The pulsating black void behind me continued its relentless pursuit, the obsidian nail glinting menacingly in the weakening beam of my phone.

As I rounded a subtle curve in the seemingly endless corridor, the white walls shifted slightly, angling inwards. The air grew colder still, and a new scent filled the sterile void – a faint, metallic tang, overlaid with something sickly sweet, the same odor I'd noticed when the creature first emerged from my bedroom wall.

And then I saw it.

At the end of the narrowing corridor, the white walls opened into a vast, circular chamber. The walls here were no longer smooth but ribbed and pulsating with a soft, internal light. In the center of the chamber, bathed in an eerie glow, was a colossal, pulsating black orb. It was easily the size of my entire apartment, its surface covered in a network of writhing black filaments and countless open, black eyes.

And suspended within its shadowy depths, struggling weakly, was my cat.

A low, resonant hum filled the chamber, emanating from the giant orb.  filled the chamber, emanating from the giant orb. It was the same humming I'd heard before, but amplified a hundredfold, vibrating through my very being.

The single white dot I'd seen on the smaller creature now manifested as a swirling vortex of light on the surface of this colossal entity, its gaze all-encompassing, all-knowing.

The black void that had been pursuing me detached itself from the wall and floated into the chamber, its long, sharp tendril twitching. It moved towards the giant orb, its movements subservient, almost reverent.

Understanding crashed down on me, cold and absolute. This wasn't Limbo. This wasn't a nightmare. This was the source. The black spot, the breathing wall, the creature… they were all extensions of this massive, malevolent entity. And the refrigerator… it wasn't just a gateway. It was a part of it.

The giant orb pulsed again, and the humming intensified. The black eyes fixed on me, and I felt that same sickening pull, that overwhelming hunger, amplified to an unbearable degree. This wasn't just about consuming my apartment or my neighborhood. It wanted everything. It wanted *me*.

My phone slipped from my numb fingers and clattered to the floor, its light casting a weak beam on the pulsating walls. I was trapped. There was no escape. This corridor hadn't been leading me away from the horror. It had been leading me directly to its heart.

And as the giant black orb pulsed again, a new sound echoed through the chamber, a wet, anticipatory clicking that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.

It was hungry and it was leading me right to it.

I picked up my phone again and then realized what the new sound was. It was a familiar low whirring. I looked towards the left edge of the pulsating wall about six feet away from the orb. A glowing cube covered in an undulating ooze. 

The microwave!

I could faintly see the timer on it through the wiggling slimy ooze. It's clock ticking down so slowly. It had been running this entire time. This has to be the longest 2 minutes I’ve ever seen! Now it says it has only 16 seconds left, but that could take hours. 

The longer I stared at the timer the slower it went. It took me a few moments to realize that the black eyes all over the walls were also staring at it as well. I shook my phone light around. The eyes looked back at me for a moment. The timer ticked down. 

Wherever they looked, time slowed. 

I began jumping and waving my light around. A myriad of eyes looking up on me. I had a plan. 

I needed to distract as many eyes so that the microwave would finish cooking. I know it sounds crazy and/or stupid, but what if it was just hungry for the pizza? Wouldn’t I be dead and eaten already if it wasn't? I had to at least try!

The whirring of the microwave, a sound so mundane, was now the only beacon of potential salvation in this terrifying abyss. The undulating ooze covering it seemed to writhe in sync with the pulsating walls, a grotesque parody of cooking food.

Sixteen seconds. Each tick of the digital timer felt like an eternity, stretched and distorted by the countless black eyes fixated upon it. My frantic waving of the phone light was the only thing that seemed to momentarily draw their attention away, their gaze shifting from the glowing cube to my desperate flailing.

The colossal black orb in the center of the chamber remained still, its swirling white vortex of an eye seemingly observing everything, a silent, malevolent overseer. The smaller black void with its obsidian tendril hovered nearby, its movements mirroring the subtle pulses of the larger entity.

My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic rhythm against the slow, deliberate ticking of the microwave timer. Could this truly work? Could this cosmic horror be appeased by lukewarm leftover pizza? The thought was ludicrous, yet it was the only sliver of hope I had.

With a renewed surge of adrenaline, I began to move more erratically, leaping and spinning, casting the beam of my phone light across the pulsating walls. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of black eyes swiveled to follow the light, their attention momentarily diverted from the agonizingly slow countdown.

Each second felt like a lifetime. The timer blinked: 15… 14… The whirring of the microwave seemed to grow louder, a defiant hum against the oppressive silence of the chamber.

The black void with the tendril twitched, its attention flickering between my movements and the glowing cube. The colossal orb remained impassive, its swirling eye a vortex of unknowable intent.

13… 12… My muscles screamed in protest, my movements becoming jerky and uncoordinated. But I couldn't stop. The fate of my cat, my apartment, perhaps even more, rested on these absurd, desperate actions.

11… 10… A low growl rumbled from the direction of the pursuing black void. Its obsidian nail flexed, a clear sign of its growing impatience.

9… 8… The pulsating walls seemed to constrict slightly, the soft internal light intensifying. The air grew thick with anticipation.

7… 6… My phone light flickered, the battery finally beginning to succumb to the prolonged use. Panic flared anew.

5… 4… The black eyes on the walls seemed to multiply, their gaze more intense, more focused on the glowing microwave. My frantic movements were losing their effectiveness.

3… 2… The whirring of the microwave reached a fever pitch. The ooze covering it bubbled and shifted more violently.

1…

A loud *PING!* echoed through the chamber.

The whirring stopped. The ooze on the microwave stilled. The timer on the display went dark.

Silence descended once more, heavier and more profound than before. All the black eyes, including the swirling vortex of the colossal orb, were now fixed on the silent, glowing cube.

I held my breath, every nerve in my body screaming. Had it worked? Had my insane gamble paid off?

Then, slowly, deliberately, the colossal black orb began to rotate. Its countless eyes remained fixed on the microwave. And as it completed its rotation, a single, enormous maw, lined with rows upon rows of razor-sharp teeth, silently opened on its opposite side.

And all the eyes were now looking at me.

It was do or die. 

I dashed towards the microwave. My hands sliding around its ooze-covered exterior trying to find the “open” button. It was steaming hot. I grab the edges of where the microwave door would be and frantically pull. Black slimy tendrils were holding the door shut like a hundred rubber bands. I tugged and tugged. I looked behind me as I was pulling. The black orb’s groups of eyes parted as its mouth slipped into position. Two clusters of eyes with its gaping maw right in the middle. It was now inching closer and closer!

I desperately lift my right leg while pulling the door with both hands and kick the right side of the microwave with all my might! My heel managed to connect with the “open” button as I was pulling and the microwave door snapped open. A glowing light emitted from within its warm interior. A familiar steamy cheesy smell engulfed the room. 

The orb’s eyes dilated. It's mouth drooling thick slimy black tar. In a frenzy, I lifted up the microwave and slammed it into the orb’s mouth. Within seconds of it devouring the microwave, I punched the “popcorn” button. Sparks flew! The orb's eyes rolled back and shined blue! Ooze everywhere began to writhe and wiggle violently! It all receded into the walls as the orb began to melt with it. It's eyes popping like popcorn kernels! The smell of vinegar and baking soda hit my nostrils and a smile grew on my face! 

I collapsed onto the floor and looked around me. My kitchen has gone back to normal. All the ooze disintegrated except a small pile slowly inching away. It was headed towards the refrigerator. From the corner of my eye I saw a blurry mass fly from the counter. Benji with his claws out pounced towards the ooze. I quickly got up, kicked the refrigerator door closed, and snatched Benji up. The ooze barely made it into the refrigerator as it slowly melted into the floor. 

I won!

I then placed Benji back on the counter and gave him a treat from the cupboard. With a sigh of relief, I began to clean up around the kitchen. Deciding that it had been long enough, I opened the refrigerator door. 

Spotless!

As it should be.

I go to the bottom drawer, put the condiments back on the shelf, and then grab the eggs. 

One of the eggs slipped from my fingers.






















There was a black spot on one of the eggs…
