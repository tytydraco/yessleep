If you’re reading this, what’s done is done. I’m sorry for everything they say I did. I know that my apologies will never make up for my actions, but it’s all I have left to offer. 

By now, the news has undoubtedly painted me as a blood thirsty psychopath, but know that I had a good reason for everything. It filled me with immense dread and pain, but for the sake of us all, I had to do it. 

Sarah’s Parents: I know you’ll never forgive me. I don’t expect you to. Losing your daughter must have been heartbreaking, let alone the grandkids. The paperwork and instructions for all of our assets are in the top drawer of the armoire. I have a lawyer on standby to liquidate anything you don’t want to provide financial assistance for the both of you. I know it’ll never replace what you lost, but it should relieve that aspect of grief. The photo albums are in the top of the closet. You know Sarah loved to scrapbook so any memory you could want should be there. Just know that what I did was not malicious. I did it out of necessity. 

Hilldale Police Department and any other investigators involved: Everything past this point can be considered my confession. I understand if this document cannot be accepted as of sound mind and body so I have also dictated this to my lawyer and he has a notarized copy that should match up. There is no reason for the investigation to continue. My in-laws have no need to be harassed with questions. Let the case close and let them bury their loved ones. 

Monday 7 July

I was awoken from a nightmare filled with gore and violence. At the foot of my bed sat my two children, John (6) and Sally (9). I got out of bed, got them water and put them back to bed. On my way back to my room, I slipped on the floor and hit my head. While in my daze, I was met by a dark figure that handed me a book and explained that I would know what to do with it when the time came. I got myself up and returned to bed. That morning, on my desk at work, sat the same book. Its dark brown leather bindings were unmistakable. The pages were brittle and yellowed with age. As I turned to the first I was hit with an odor of decay and sulphur. The book began “I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals.” I quickly closed it, immediately recognizing its origin. The book went into my bag and I attempted to finish my day. 

That night, I was blessed with another nightmare. In this one the dark figure spoke to me. What I assume were its eyes stared into mine and in a dark ethereal voice it said “2. 23.” Then I awoke. I scrambled for the book. Inside I turned to chapter 2, page 23 and saw what had to be done. I woke Sarah, told her I had gotten a call from work, and left to begin my preparations. 

When I returned later that day, I called everyone into the family room. They sat on the couch and I stood before them with an air of defeat. “Daddy has to do bad things. Don’t worry, everyone will be okay. Trust me.” Sally and John seemed frightened but assured by my fake confidence. Sarah had a look of quiet disgust and fear. She shoved it down to embrace our children. That evening we had a long discussion where I explained to her my visions and I showed her the book. After some argument and hushed yelling she decided that I should seek mental help and gave me a number to call. Instead I went to the priest. After explaining to him what I felt were the important details, he reassured me that a higher power had a plan for me and my family. His words, undoubtedly meant to be comforting, only cemented in my head what I had to do. I went home that night and prepared for the worst. 

Before I go on, I’m sorry. This wasn’t supposed to happen. I’m no one special. Sure I had my dreams and aspirations but then I got married and had kids. I was a normal suburban man with a normal job. I don’t know why I did what I did, except that I had to. That part was clear. 

Wednesday 9 July

I started with Sally. She had always been meek and soft spoken so I knew she wouldn’t put up much of a fight. She was still asleep in her bed, so I stood in her doorway and watched her sleep. My little angel. After two long years of trying and trying, she surprised us as a welcome Christmas gift. That tiny pink blanket made it so that September would never be the same. When we brought her home she was no bigger than my forearm. The long nights and endless diapers formed the princess that slept so peacefully wrapped in her big kid blanket that we got her when she went to kindergarten. That long beautiful brown hair that her mother meticulously brushed every morning became a dark mess as my hammer connected with the cowlick. Strike after strike with such fury that my face quickly became painted by the tiny red drops of matter that escaped. She didn’t even have a chance to fight. Before either of us knew what happened, she had lost all grip on her teddy bear and slumped into her mattress. I wiped the tears and blood from my face and moved down the hallway. 

As I stood outside John’s door, collecting my breath and calming my quivering emotions, I heard some motion inside. I cracked the door, silhouetting myself with the hallway light. “Daddy, what’s going on?” A tiny voice emerged from the shadows. 

“It’s okay buddy, just lay back down.”  He relaxed back into his pillow as I closed the door behind me. I was already making too much noise so I had to change my approach. Next to his bed was a stuffed stegosaurus that he got for his birthday. We had visited the Utah museum of natural history and it ignited a love of dinosaurs. He had fallen in love with the giant skeleton on display and when they had the stuffy in the gift shop it was a no brainer. He carried that thing home and didn’t let go of it for days. Steggy ate dinner with us, he went on car rides, and he even escorted John to the bathroom during potty training. The love that he had for these prehistoric giants surpassed that of any cartoon or even graham crackers. The plush fake scale texture added a level of grip that allowed it to easily be used to snuff out his young life. As he squirmed under my weight, I could hear him trying to struggle and plead. As he continued yelling “Daddy! Daddy please!” I couldn’t help but break down. When his tiny appendages relaxed and gave in the only sound left was my sobs. I sat on the bed next to him and stroked his hair. I cried so loud that I woke up my wife. 

I raised my head to walk out and Sarah’s eyes met mine in the doorway. The shock and horror on her face ignited a rage in me that I’ve never felt before. She knew what I was doing. She knew why I was doing it. She wasn’t supposed to be involved and now she stood there judging me. I lunged at her and pinned her to the ground. Blow after blow my balled fists connected with her face until it became an unrecognizable pile of hamburger. When she quit fighting, I stood up and cleaned the blood off my hands. As I looked at the bruises and developing defensive wounds from her perfectly manicured nails, I had a realization sweep over me. The things I had done were all in service of a mission, but Sarah was innocent. After cleaning myself to a point of acceptability I ran. 

I hopped in the car and wound up at my dad’s. I walked in as he was finishing his cup of coffee before continuing with his morning routine. My physical condition understandably shocked him and he brought me inside. After assuring him that I was fine I broke down in tears and explained the whole ordeal. He was dumbfounded. The first thing he did was call the police, report the crime at my house, and then he came to me and started working over a strategy. As an old defense attorney himself, he connected me with one of his old colleagues who rushed to the house expecting a bourbon and cigar on the porch. When he arrived my dad paid him and he went to work recording this information and arranging my documents. As he left, my father ushered me upstairs and got me into a shower. Once I was cleaned and changed, he urged me to step into the guest room where I am now writing this letter from. 

I don’t know if I can say it enough, but I am sorry. I only did what I had to. I love my family. I will undoubtedly pay for my actions, but I rest easy knowing that I have lived my life and performed all actions according to his plan and his will. 

Dad: I apologize for the mess. I know you’ll find this letter before the police do, but please return it to where you found it and let them do their work. Thank you for everything you have done for me. Know that you had no part in this. I love you and I always have. I’m sorry for everything. 

This letter was found near the body of Mr. Caleb Whitmore following a Hilldale Police response to a shots fired call from outside the home. The individual was located in the guest room of his father’s house surrounded by photos of his children and wife, who were discovered earlier that day massacred in their home. Mr. Whitmore apparently suffered from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Following an in depth investigation by the Utah Bureau of Investigations, the community continues to reel in the wake of this indescribable tragedy.
