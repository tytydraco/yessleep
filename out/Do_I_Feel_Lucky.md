Some would call me lucky. Being the last survivor of my species, having outrun the singular disaster caused by hubris and curiosity of me and my colleagues at High Energy Research Lab. It was our hubris, the worst of deadly sins, the one that gods used to inflict on people they wanted to destroy, that led us to the path we took. We could, so we had to. Caution was dismissed as easily as my handwave to doctor Park’s warning of unheard of energy we were about to unleash. Curiosity. We just had to know. Even now, I can’t subdue my curiosity. 

Any moment now, the fifth planet of this system, the last system in the last galaxy, will start disintegrating as the pilot wave of the Rip reaches it. I have it locked on the observation port of my spaceship at maximum magnification. I wonder what it would look like. How does this thing I helped conjure work? So far I couldn’t observe it in detail. I had no time to observe the actual process as it unfolded. Now I can. Now I have all the time that is left.

As the first glimmer of the ripping process hit the planetesimal, my mind was reminded of a small blue, eerie flash in the interaction chamber. Despite being only a decade ago, it seemed ages ago. And only hours ago the Universe began to unravel. An entire age of the universe flashed by as my ship raced across parsecs, always closely pursued by the rippling wave, never quite escaping, but never quite being caught. Countless eons were compressed into seconds, galactic structures flashing by. And now here I am. I don’t know to whom I address this record - by logic, there won’t be anyone or anything left to perceive it. The end of all things extends no mercy, no reprieve. Perhaps to all the ghosts chasing me at the headwave. Is it forgiveness I seek? I’ll ask them, when they catch up. 

Meanwhile, the ghostly glimmer of the planet dissolved in a sea of blue flash - Cherenkov radiation? Maybe that is the propagation method. Not that it matters now. It may have been useful back then, when we thought it was the negative energy. Perhaps we should have foreseen the consequence of ‘Hmmm. That’s strange.’ I know of no scientific discovery whose announcement was preceded by epiphanic ‘Eureka’. None. Every single one followed the ‘That’s weird?’ question. 

A faint blue glimmer looked so beautiful. So beguiling. Like a trapped willow, the energy discharge, something that should not be visible on a macro level, raced inside the interaction chamber, the high speed camera locked on the center. The superconductor coils worked, and our apparatus reached beyond the limits of anything we knew so far. LHC? It was a mere matchstick. It could serve as a pre-acceleration circuit to our machine. Energies in Exa electronVolts range were within our grasp. Perhaps we should not have mocked the crowd of doomsayers that protested in front of the facility so condescendingly. ‘But what could possibly go wrong?’ were the only last words equally apt to a college prank and a universe ending experiment. 

And so, a faithful sequence was put in motion. Jane’s “Hmmm, that shouldn’t happen…” as she kept her eyes to the monitor brought our attention to the numbers dancing on the wall projector. It showed the estimated power of the impacts. It reached 3 EeV and lingered there for a moment, as it was supposed to. All of a sudden, the number crawled up to 3.5, 4.0 and then, in ever increasing increments, raced all the way to 12 EeV, an impossible figure - our apparatus was not designed to contain such loads. Our ‘willow’ jumped outside the chamber into the open space near the ceiling of the huge instrument room that held the interaction chamber within, clearly visible on the cameras. Jane quickly pushed the switch from AUTO DISENGAGE to MANUAL OVERRIDE and pressed the red button, shutting the superconductors and the magnetic coils down. As the hum of the machinery died off slowly, our willow blinked and died. Little did we know what we started. The full impact of our action was revealed to us only later. Gods still allowed our hubris to build up. 

Right then, we glanced at each other, eyes wide open, waiting for something to happen. When nothing did, Jane printed the analytic spreadsheets and the image of the colliding particles, with multiple tracks emanating in all directions. On careful examination, one could see the discontinuities in the tracks. I declared success and the entire team's initial shock was replaced by elation. The phenomenon was exactly the effect we wanted to achieve. It was like the particles were disappearing, to appear at another place. “Could it be our ‘willow’?” Dileesh wondered aloud. It was a reasonable conclusion. 

Digesting the results of the experiment took us the better part of the year. It turned out we managed to discover a way to stabilize up ‘til that point elusive and speculative Einstein-Rosen bridge. Our ‘willow’ that disappeared was merely its physical manifestation. I will not try to recount the decade it took us to iron out all the details of the research and the engineering nuts and bolts that resulted in creation of our prototype ship. The work overshadowed everything else, even the front pages of astrophysical publications that we received through subscription. We were fleetingly aware of mounting excitement and concern in the cosmological community, but paid no heed to it. The esoteric discussions on the values of cosmological constant made no difference to us. We had our goal and we chased it blind to other concerns. It was within reach. We christened the ship - and how else, honestly - “Enterprise”. To boldly go where no one has gone before. Oh, boy did we deliver on that. And then some. The subtle difference between negative and phantom energy we - I discovered only later.

It was a spherical vessel, and although sizable, it was nowhere near its glamorous namesake. With a radius of mere twenty meters, it looked a lot like an enormous soccer ball. Despite its voluminous space, it could carry only one person, no supplies beyond basic necessities that could last a few days in a pinch and no cargo. It was a proof of concept type of vessel, like Turbinia. Well, it did not require any facilities. Basically we built it from the keel up in the hangar at our lab compound. The center was occupied by a compact fusion reactor that powered the circular accelerator cleverly embedded into the spherical surface to allow for maximum length of the plumbing.

As a team leader, I was the logical choice to be the first pilot/passenger of the vessel. Our ideas how it all worked were formed around the initial assumption that the negative energy allowed us to stabilize the bridge. We intuited that the wavelength of the beam allowed the selection of the destination. About that time, ten years to the day after our experiment, the earth shattering news of Epsilon Eridani disappearance landed with a force of antimatter explosion, penetrating even our secluded circle. We were all wondering, puzzled by the date coincidence, if it had anything to do with our experiment. Evading each other’s eyes, we completed the final checks and system validation and I boarded the cramped control bridge, though perhaps enclosement would have been a better word.  

Peering through the narrow slit of the observation port I waved goodbye to my erstwhile colleagues and embarked on the maiden voyage. Premonition and doubt swelled in me and a faint and ominous echo of ‘Titanic’ first voyage pressed on me as I activated the fusion reactor and primed particle injection device. How could I do otherwise? Don’t blame me. Did Oppenheimer hesitate before he pushed the buttons in Los Alamos? Yes. Did he push them, nonetheless? Yes. We worked for this thing. It was meant to bring the future and the universe straight into our lap. That, it actually did, but not in a way we hoped to. And if we didn’t do it, somebody else would have. We were just the first to land a touchdown.

Getting the ‘Enterprise’ to go about its business was a little bit more complicated than just pushing the button. It involved turning knobs, pushing levers and moving sliders. Once I selected the range and the vector, the vessel would basically disappear in one point to appear at another instantly. The points of appearance equalled the bottoms of the wave function - wavelength of what we called ‘carrier beam’. The longer the frequency of the beam - further away the ship jumped. Just as I was about to press the button, the Moon, hanging peacefully above the ship, simply vanished in a ghostly image. In that instant the full truth of what happened finally dawned in soul crushing realization. The line that connected the dots seemed as clear as a red line on the failed test. I punched the button and the starfield above started flickering, suddenly changing into completely unknown.

I kept punching the button, keeping the ship just ahead of what I now knew was a universe crushing wave, taking all before it. The run and survival kept me from focusing on the abstract reality of what I’ve caused. The long hypothesized Big Rip was a science fact. The intro notes of Bowies’ ‘The Man Who Sold the World’ provided a fitting soundtrack to my escape. The song echoed in my head spontaneously. I smiled resignedly, wishing we installed some means of reproducing sound. The solemn silence of the ship persisted, only the faint hum of the reactor providing any sign that all of this was not some vivid nightmare. 

Even if Big Rip was the eventual fate of the matter, and our experiment seemed to prove it, it provides no consolation at all. Left to its natural progress, we - and by **we** I mean everyone, everywhere - would have had billions of eons left. If time is money, as they say, I’d be a quintillionaire - I’ve robbed everyone of every second of it. Time, it seems, is the only thing you can steal, but not get any richer. So am I lucky? 

I hope there won’t be an afterlife. It would be so embarrassing. The blue ghosts were approaching. “He-”
