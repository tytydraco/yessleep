It was maybe a week after my first visit when Timothy contacted me, calling on my office phone, begging me to come out to the Greenhill property. He told me that Garden Joe had gotten drunk, rounded up a posse of cousins, and they were planning on marching down to the Blackthorpe house to “raise hell”. He thought I could talk some sense into him and I disagreed.

What were the chances that it would turn violent? Joe was a vegetarian that spent most of his free time gardening. Surely by the time I made it out there they’d be beginning to sober up and he would set himself straight. I still had some questions for him though, which lead to my ultimate decision to go.

A week was enough time to do some research and I had learned quite a bit about the Greenhills and the property that had been in their family for generations. A news clipping from the local paper, back when it was an independent paper and not owned by one of the big publishers, spoke of a legal spat between Tobias Greenhill and Gregor Blackthorpe. That was dated 1954, though, and according to Aunty Sunflower the families had been at each others’ throats longer than that.

As for the magic, well, best I could guess was that Joe was just born talented. There were manuscripts bound in leather from before the Age of Reason that I had read: books that referred to yet older books and even some scrolls that, far as I could tell, did not exist anymore. These were the spell books, with rituals and incantations and words of power. Some contained the names of demons long since forgotten to the annals of history. If they were actually still around and hadn’t decayed into dust they were probably kept safe from the prying interests of the public in some locked, forgotten chest down in the Vatican’s secret archives. I doubted Joe had managed to get a hold of one of these obscure texts, but the man had done nothing but surprise me since I met him.

Those were the thoughts that consumed me while I hurried to retrace the route Timothy had taken us the previous week. I wasn’t altogether concerned with Joe’s safety, but I did want to get there before anything bad happened.

Back at the Greenhill property Timothy was waiting for me with a side-by-side, engine purring. I hopped in beside him and we geared off past the trailers, into the gravel pit and then onto a muddy ATV track through the woods. The suspension was fucked, and it creaked with every little bump in the trail, my bony rear end getting smashed into the cracked pleather seat each time we went over something big like a tree root. I knew the Blackthorpe property abutted the Greenhill’s, and both families had an equal amount of acreage. There was no clear delineation between the properties, as was common for a rural land that hadn’t been bought, sold or subdivided since pioneer days. Neither family would want to hire a surveying company, nor even see a need to. Probably fed the feud between them even more.

We whipped around a tight bend in the trail at 25mph, and the side-by-side momentary lifted off the wheels on the driver’s side. I grabbed the roll cage and held tight, but it settled back down.

“Never do that, professor,” Timothy warned me, nodding at my hand on the metal bar of the cage. “If I tip this thing, reckon you gonna’ lose a couple fingers. Or worse.”

I let go, but it took every bit of willpower not to reach for it the rest of the journey.

We smashed through a wooden gate marked with multiple ‘NO TRESPASSING’ signs, pockmarked with bullet holes, and ripped down the trail a little further. Finally, a great big house came into view, a smaller building beside it—something like a barn or a garage—and a workshop beside that. A group of men armed with rifles and shotguns had gathered before the front porch of the house.

Garden Joe and his posse.

Timothy skidded to a stop and when he cut the engine I could hear a  creek gurgling nearby.

“Come on out!” Joe was shouting from the head of the posse. “Get your *big* yellow ass out here and face me like a *man!*” He was screaming at a closed door of what looked to be an empty house. The curtains were drawn and there were no lights on inside.

“Joe,” I said, approaching him carefully. He was the only one without a weapon but he was red-faced from whiskey or from anger. “What’s all this about? What are we doing here?”

“My sister!” Joe shouted at me, then softened his tone on his next words. “That rat-bastard kidnapped Leanne. Used her in some kind of… *ritual* or soemthin’. Years ago, when he took her from me!”

“Who did that?”

He cut his hand like a knife toward the house. “*Him!* Noah Blackthorpe.”

I raised my hands complacently. “Okay, Joe. Why don’t we just slow down and talk about it a little?”

“No! I’m done with talkin’! It’s high time people started listenin’ to *me* for a change!” He cracked his knuckles and started humming that hum.

“I don’t think this is a good idea, Joe. Whatever you’re planning, just come along with me back to your trailer and we’ll figure something else out. Call the police or something.”

He paused his humming and eyed me like I was trying to trick him into doing something. “You know it was *them* that set our house afire? The whole got-dayum reason I have nothin’ to live in is because of the Blackthorpes!” He picked up his tune again, then started vibrating, and finally aimed a finger at the grass just beside the house.

“Don’t do it, Joe,” I pleaded.

“Alcatraz!” The puff of white exploded from his fingertip and shot to the side of the house, where an oak sapling sprung out of the ground, quickly growing and maturing, it’s gnarled branches twisting and pushing up against the wall of the house, roots bursting out of the ground and growing under the foundation, pushing the whole building upward.

When the dust settled and the tree had stopped growing, the house was canted at an angle. The front door creak open, revealing a man with a bushy beard  and a thick, black mane of hair. The tan suit he wore was faded, but freshly pressed and well-tailored. The men in the posse all leveled their firearms at him, but Joe waved for them to lower them back down.

Joe raised his stump and spoke up. “How nice of you to finally join us, Reverend Blackthorpe.” He wasn’t shouting anymore but there was an edge to his voice I hadn’t heard from him before. “Shame it took me breakin’ your house apart with a little bit of my magic.” We waited for the reverend to say something but he only glared down at Joe from his porch. “Well? What have you got to say for yourself?”

“I know all about you and your Satan-gifted powers, Garden Joe,” the reverend spoke in a voice like two pieces of slate being dragged across each other. “Seems the whole damn *world* knows all about it,” he said, indicating me. “Shoulda’ kept it to yourself.” Noah Blackthorpe leaned back into his house and shouted for someone hiding inside. “Marta! Bring me Boy!”

“Don’t go hidin’ behind your family now, ya hear!” Joe shouted.

The reverend’s head snapped around and leveled another glare at him. “Repent, son. Get down on your knees. *Pray* for what you did to my son. Pray to God while there’s still time.”

“Pray to God?” Joe shouted, and laughed.

*Don’t say it,* I thought, *just keep your mouth shut for once.* He did not.

“I *am* God!” Joe announced, half to the crowd and half to the Blackthorpe man.

*Quod erat demonstrandum.*

Noah Blackthorpe stepped back into his house for a moment and pulled a young man in front of him.

Reader, I don’t know how to describe Boy Blackthorpe without being impolite. All I will say is that the young man is rather short for his age, appears to be developmentally delayed, and his face reaches beyond the level of what you or I might call ‘normal’. You can do with that information whatsoever you choose. It’s beyond the scope of this report to describe, in detail, the many facial and body disfigurements he has. He is not a ‘creature’, as I have heard people describe him, nor is there any definitive proof he is ‘inbred’. Boy Blackthorpe has gone through enough as it is and doesn’t need us speculating over the genealogical sameness of his parents.

That all said, I did look into the matter and Reverend Noah Blackthorpe is married his second cousin.

The reverend controlled his son by gripping him from the shoulders, pushing him so he was out front, facing us, like he was intending to use him as a human shield. He bent over and whispered something into Boy’s ear. Boy, for his part, barely seemed to be listening to his father. He squirmed beneath his father’s hands, and refused to look at the crowd of armed, angry men, casting his gaze to the sky. The reverend continued to whisper, pause, wait for a reply, then shake his son, who only responded by scrunching his face up in fear and clamping his hands over his ears. The reverend would just pry his hands away and continue on with the charade. Boy protested by making vocalizations that weren’t real words, but he seemed incapable of fighting back against his father’s increasingly-violent shakes. This went on for a minute or two, before *Mr. Jesus* grew restless and decided to escalate things.

“I will burn this house to the ground!” Joe shouted, veins popping in his neck, his body tense, his muscles flexed. “Burn it all to cinders! You need to tell me what you did with my kid sister, reverend! What in God’s holy, green earth do you think we’re all here f—”

His words were cut off. Boy cranked his jaw open unnaturally wide and *screamed*, launching a missile of milky, white smoke from his mouth. It streaked over my head and exploded into the posse behind Joe and I. There were shouts of surprise and a few men tried to dive out of the way, but the smoke enveloped them completely. I could hear the men inside it stumbling around as they lost sight of each other and the outside world.

And then the screaming began.

Whatever was happening to the men inside that cloud must have been a painful experience — they shrieked like nothing else I had ever heard before. They shrieked like they were being pulled apart, vivisected, and stitched back together. A single shot from a rifle fired off into the sky and I instinctively ducked. That was enough for me, and I took the moment to run a wide arc around the cloud back to where Timothy was crouched behind the side-by-side. His eyes were wide with wonder, bulging with fear, and teary-eyed from the sounds of his friends suffering.

“What’s happenin’ to them,” he whispered.

I swiped the sweat from my brow. “We need to get the hell out of here.”

“No! We can’t leave without Garden Joe!”

The miracle man was circling the cloud, determined to help his cousins but hesitant to enter it. He vibrated and pointed a finger at the cloud, uttered a power word, and shot his own little puff of smoke into the fray.

The screams only increased. A twisted and profane version of a plant sprouted from the cloud, growing like a thick beanstalk into the sky before drooping over from its own weight. It was fleshy and pinkish, with something that might be veins under its ‘skin’, and its leaves were engorged and deep red. There were pustules growing and bursting, and growing again, as the plant-thing curled up around the cloud like a giant coil of raw sausage.

Joe clasped his hand to his head, twisting is fingers up in his mullet, mouth agape as he realized what he had done. Still, shrieks emanated from within, assuring us that the torture was still on-going. And behind it all stood Reverend Noah, hands on his son’s shoulders, shaking him.

*Vibrating him.*

The boy opened his mouth again.

“Joe!” I called, pointing behind him. He glanced over his shoulder and saw the fresh puff of smoke shooting toward him, throwing himself to the ground and rolling out of the way just in time. This cloud, too, quickly grew to envelope the area in its twisted powers. Joe hopped to his feet and sprinted toward the side-by-side. Timothy jumped in the driver’s seat and I into the passenger seat. He started the engine and threw it into drive.

“Go,” I ordered, the cloud hot on Joe’s heels. “Go, go, go, go!”

“But Joe—“

“Go!”

The engine roared as he revved the throttle and spun out the wheels, spraying mud and grass directly into Joe’s face, the man barely flinching as mud covered his whole upper body, his white, beady eyes poking out from beneath a fresh mud-mask. The side-by-side was at last moving, picking up speed as Joe got closer. I leaned out the side, gripping the roll cage, and held my other hand out to Joe. He reached for it, clasping his fingers around my forearm and my fingers tightened around his. He jumped and I swung him around and into the bed of the vehicle, where he let me go and wrapped his arm around the headrest of my seat.

We were truly *ripping* at this point, the Blackthorpe house already lost around a bend in the trail. Joe and I gazed back, waiting to see if there was anything following us, any smoke creeping around the trees.

There was nothing.

You couldn’t even hear the screams from here.

“Never… never ran so fast in my life,” Joe said, out of breath and I could have sworn I picked up a hint of that Greenhill pride in his words. “Fucker almost got one up on me.”

“Did you know about that?”

“Know about Boy? I knew he existed! Knew they kept him locked up on account of being an embarrassment to the family name. But I didn’t know he could do… *that!*”

“What was the reverend talking about?” I asked Joe. “What did he mean that you should pray for what you did to his family? What did you do to them, Joe?” I knew he wouldn’t like me prying into that aspect of his past but I had a feeling that my time with Garden Joe was coming to a close. I needed to know who this man was that I had allied myself with.

Joe scrunched his face up. “*Nothin’!* Old fool thinks I killed his son—the other one, the one that’s not named ‘Boy’.” He spat phlegm and blood out the side of the vehicle. Now that the adrenaline and whiskey was wearing off his tone was calming, his words growing quieter. “Just up and vanished, you know? When I was a kid. ‘Spose to be watchin’ my sister and I…” He curled up into a ball in the back of the side-by-side. “I ain’t talkin’ about this anymore.”

“You can probably slow down a bit,” I said to Timothy, who was still white-knuckling the steering wheel as we careened down the bush trail.

He did, and unexpectedly addressed me instead of Joe. “Are we safe?” he asked, his voice high and squeaky.

“I don’t think they’re following us. And I don’t think Boy can run very fast, if he can at all.”

“So he’s like… He’s like a *wizard?* Just like Garden Joe?”

“I guess so. A different kind of wizard, though.” I cast a glance back at Joe, still curled up with his arm wrapped around my seat.

“He can’t *create* life,” Joe muttered. “He ain’t like me. He can only \*twist\* reality. Change it into somethin’ else.” He kicked his feet into the ruggedized bed-liner. “All them good boys, all fucked up like that. Goddamnit.”

I didn’t want to say it out loud—because I suspected that the others were already ruminating on it—but I wondered if they were actually dead or if we had just witnessed the start of a fate much worse than death.

“Goddamnit,” Joe repeated, quieter.

“How’s about we lay off the whiskey for a while?” Timothy suggested.

“Shut up, Timothy.”

We rode in silence for the rest of the way back to the trailers. Night had fallen but there was no way in hell I was staying there overnight. I didn’t say goodbye, just got in my car and navigated my way back through the maze of unlit dirt roads and neglected, pitted backroads, scanning the treeline the whole way.

First thing I did when I arrived home was poor myself a tall bourbon on the rocks, then searched for the metal cache box that held my pistol. I sat in the dark, curtains drawn, pistol loaded and sitting on the glass IKEA side table next to me. It looked like a toy, to be honest. The whole room looked fake. The bourbon tasted like water.

But eventually I stopped shaking.

You might be wondering why I didn’t just pack up and leave town right there and then. That if I stayed it would make me complicit in the actions of the afternoon. Maybe you’re *speculatin’* right now that I chose to stay behind because I was involved in something more serious than anything before that had happened in this God-given world, and because of that I was compelled to continue on down this path.

You’d be wrong though.

Certainly, I had it in my head to leave town altogether. I fantasized about it for days. But let me tell you this: when you are a professor of Anthropology working towards tenure and the economy is in a freefall, you *stay where the fuck you are*.

So I did.

And when Garden Joe called me a couple days later, against every best interest, I went back.
