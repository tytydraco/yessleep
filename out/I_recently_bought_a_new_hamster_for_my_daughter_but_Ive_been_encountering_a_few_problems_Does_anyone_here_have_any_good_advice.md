The only thing my ten year old daughter, Isobel, requested for her birthday was a hamster.

Her best friend Miranda had gotten one only a couple months beforehand, and now it was all that she could talk about. *Dad, look!* She would exclaim, as she shoved her phone into my face. *Look at Miranda's hamster eating lettuce! OH. MY. GOD. How cute is she?!*

It was a picture. Of a hamster. I didn't see the appeal. But it was all she wanted to say, hamster-this, hamster-that. Finally, and after much deliberation with my wife, Ella, we decided to acquiesce to her wishes. After all, a hamster as a first pet wasn't such a bad idea. It would teach her responsibility, and all those other desirable quality traits google would tell me about.

And so, two weeks later Isobel got her wish. The joy that radiated off her face was well worth the poop-scooping status that I had been delegated to. In true ten-year-old-girl fashion, the hamster was affectionately named Mr Fuzzycheeks.

And, well, over the next few days, I had never seen Isobel happier. She was either fawning over Mr Fuzzycheeks while he was inside his cage, or tenderly carrying him inside her arms, insisting that she show Mr Fuzzycheeks what the house looked like. She was happy, so I was happy. Ella, however, seemed to be slightly concerned for the hamster’s well being. She was always fretting over him, asking me if I was sure that I had fed him, *‘because he looks so hungry.’*

I would tell her that, yes, I had fed the hamster, and not to worry. She seemed as if she didn’t believe me, always looking over at Mr Fuzzycheeks cage, a worried expression plastered on her face. I was slightly concerned for Ella, but I could also see where she was coming from. There was something *off* about the hamster.

I mean, I would never admit it, but he just seemed so. . .*unnatural*. I know it sounds insane to say it, but I was almost scared of my daughter’s pet hamster. It had gotten to the point where I actively avoided being in the same room as him. I couldn’t really tell what made him so strange to me. It could have been his black, soulless, little pinpricks of eyes that followed me around the room, and glistened with such unequaled *hunger* wherever it looked.

It could have been the way the hamster ate his food. Place some vegetables in front of him, and they’d be gone before you would take your hand out of the cage. He ate like that meal would be his last, accompanied by loud, wet smacking noises that came from his tiny mouth as he ate. Being close to him as he ate was not a pleasant experience.

*What are you doing?* I would chide myself. *It’s a freaking hamster. Stop acting like an idiot. You’ll get used to him, and things will get better.*

In reality, things got a lot worse the night Ella disappeared.

The evening before she disappeared, her insistence that Mr Fuzzycheeks was hungry had become more frequent. She would slip the phrase into almost every conversation we had, claiming that, *‘he probably hasn’t been fed enough. I know hamsters look small, but they have a huge appetite.’*

I would wave her claims off. Mr Fuzzycheeks had been fed, That was the end of that.

In hindsight, I should have listened to what she had to say. Because the next morning she was gone. There wasn’t a single trace of her. I looked everywhere- called friends and the police. But there were no witnesses. No theories. Nothing. She had simply vanished.

The only strange thing I had found that morning was that the carpeted floor around the living room was damp- sticky almost. A closer look revealed that there was a thin, clear liquid that was stretched across the entirety of the room. But I couldn’t make out what it was.

The police weren’t too much of a help. Ella was a thinking adult, after all. There was no sign of any struggle, and people are allowed to leave. I tried to break the news gently to Isobel over lunch that her mother had disappeared. But she seemed disinterested, indifferent almost.

She seemed to be more focused on Mr Fuzzycheeks as she ate. Looking over from his cage to her plate of food. She swallowed a forkful of rice before looking up to me and asking, “Have you fed Mr Fuzzycheeks today? He looks hungry.”

I stared at her, fork midway to mouth, as I tried to process what she had just said, ‘I. . .uhh, of course I have, sweetie. What makes you think I haven’t?”

She shrugged. “Just asking. That’s all.”

But that wasn't all. Over the next few days, as I tried to work with the police, who had finally opened an investigation, Isobel continued to ask me the same query more and more frequently. More urgently.

“Are you sure you fed Mr Fuzzycheeks dad?” She would ask, her voice shaky and tears welling up in her eyes. “I can’t bear to think of him going through another night *starving*.”

“Of course I have. He’s not hungry, I’ve told you this before, sweetheart.” I would answer her, but she would shake her head at me, clearly not believing what I had said. She spent most of her time sitting next to Mr Fuzzycheeks cage, fawning over him.

That night, I heard a sound. Ever since Ella’s disappearance, I hadn’t been able to sleep at night at all, worrying that whatever had befallen her would happen to Isobel as well. I spent my night’s tossing and wishing that Ella would just come back. And so, I heard the sound. It was sharp and metallic, but subdued, almost as if whatever had caused the sound was purposefully trying to be quiet.

I lay in bed, contemplating what I had just heard. Then the sound rang out through the darkness again, and again, at varying intervals. Four, five times.

*Six.* I counted.

*Seven.*

The sounds were irregular in frequency. So it wasn’t some automated machine whirring in the dead of night. No, it was something being acted upon by a conscious, physical force, human or otherwise.

*Eight.*

*Alright, next sound and I go up and look at what’s going on.* I told myself.

*Nine.*

I wearily crept out of bed and made my way downstairs, to where I thought the sound was originating from. I passed by Isobel’s room on the way there and had a peek inside. Her room was immaculate, as usual. Everything put neatly away, her clothes folded, the bed made. I smiled and left.

*. . .the bed was made.*

I quickly spun around. The bed was flat, with no human-like shapes in the cover that indicted someone was concealed underneath. *She wasn’t there.*

I searched through the empty room, my heart in my throat and fear creeping in.

“Isobel, where are you?” I said under my breath.

*Snick.* The sound emanated from the darkness once more. Making up my mind, I continued my silent journey towards the sound’s origin, trying to discern what it was as I moved.

*Snick.*

It had become louder as I moved closer to the living room. I slowly passed through the doorway and placed my hand on the switch, chasing away the darkness and bathing the room in light, causing my eyes to instinctively squint in pain.

I was not ready for the scene that the light revealed.

Isobel was sitting next to Mr Fuzzycheek’s cage, a kitchen knife in hand, and the upper half of her body entirely inside of his cage. The entirety of the skin and muscle on her left leg was whittled down to the bone, leaving nothing but a skeleton poking out from a mound of blood-stained flesh. She was working on her right leg, gingerly removing the flesh and sinew with sharp cuts that made a snick as the knife moved through her body. Next to her, in his cage, Mr Fuzzycheeks was nibbling on what was left of her leg.

In one dreadful moment, everything became clear. She was *feeding* him.

“Isobel!” I called out.

She didn’t respond.

I ran towards her, fearing for her life. I touched her on the shoulder, and she flinched, turning her head to face me. As she looked at me, I realized why she wasn’t responding. Her leg wasn’t the only thing missing. She had lopped off both of her ears, leaving behind streams of blood that trailed into Mr Fuzzycheeks cage. The hamster was lapping up the blood as it ate, making a quick meal of Isobel’s appendages.

Isobel’s left eye was also gouged out, leaving behind a blood-filled pit to showcase what was once stationed there. Instinctively, I tried to grab the knife out of her hand. She pulled away from me, not letting me even touch her.

“What are you doing?!” She shrieked. Her voice was low and gurgled slightly, almost as if she was speaking underwater.

“Isobel. . .stop! You’re hurting yourself!” I pleaded.

“Can’t you see I’m feeding him? Can’t you see how *hungry* he is?”

In a split-second decision, I tried to push Isobel to the ground. The rational side of me didn’t want to hurt her, but the logical side knew if I didn’t stop her at any cost, she would hurt herself worse than I could.

I swung at her.

She brushed aside my blow, with inhuman strength disproportionate to her ten year old body. “What are you doing?!” She yelled again, louder than before.

I fell backwards, fazed by her newfound strength.

She stood up, hunched on one side on account of her non-existent leg, and held the knife in her hand, poised at me. Her blood-soaked hair fell in front of her face as she moved forwards, sending tear-like blood droplets down her forehead and onto the floor.

“Isobel! Izzy! Listen to me! Stop! You’re hurting yourself!” I pleaded with her.

“You *CANNOT* stop Mr Fuzzycheeks’ feeding time!”

She took a step forward. I stepped backwards, suddenly fearing my own daughter.

Her lips curled into a tight, slightly deranged smile. “Mr Fuzzycheeks needs his food, and I am *MORE* than happy to provide.” Behind her, the hamster began squeaking. By the looks of it, it had already finished its meal, and was eager to begin the next course.

The squeaking seemed to invigorate Isobel, and she lunged forwards, knife aiming for my chest. Foreseeing her move, I rolled to the side and tried to figure out how I should go about this situation. I did have the advantage of size over her, but she seemed to trump me in strength. I obviously didn’t want her dead, but it looked like she couldn’t care less.

It wasn’t looking good.

I slowly stood up and maneuvered myself between the hamster and Isobel. Maybe if I could somehow kill the damned hamster, Isobel would snap out of it. We kept circling until we were all in a perfectly straight line. The hamster was a few feet behind me and squeaking like mad. Isobel was in front of me, closer than I would have liked, a crazed look in her remaining eye and red-stained teeth that glistened in the darkness.

*Alright*. I said to myself. *Grab the hamster. Jump out of Isobel’s way. Grab the hamster. Jump out of Isobel’s way.*

I grabbed the hamster. It bit me. Hard. Isobel started shrieking. I jumped in pain. Both from the ferocity of Mr Fuzzycheeks’ bite and the intensity of the scream that Isobel was somehow making. I buried my ears in the palms of my hands, my head throbbing with pain.

Isobel threw her head back and started running at full speed towards me, all without ever stopping her shrieking. She hit me like a freight train and I was thrown back against the wall, my chest heaving. My vision became blurry, dotted with black spots that pulsated through my retina. On my hands and knees and in immense pain, I weakly tried to crawl away.

Isobel jerked her head forward, gazing directly into my eyes. “Please. . .” I said, in between heavy breaths.

Isobel cocked her head, yet her face remained blank and cold. “Mr Fuzzycheeks *needs* to eat. You’ll see.”

She grabbed me by the neck and lifted me of the ground. I squeezed my eyes shut. The truth was that I was scared. Not for my own life, but for Isobel’s. First Ella, and now *her*? The thought was too much. She was killing us both for a *fucking hamster*.

She smacked my head against the wall, creating a sickening crack, and making me fall to the ground. Lifeless. It was dark and I was cold. I could hear Isobel continue to remove chunks of her body, but I could do nothing. I was afraid. I was stuck. I was alone. I was worse than dead. My eyelids shone brightly and stung from the blood that was streaming down my face. But I still managed to sleep.

I woke up the next morning, with some control of my movements. There was no sign of the events of the previous nights. The blood and pieces of flesh that had covered the floor were all gone, replaced by a light coating of a clear substance.

Saliva.

Isobel had disappeared as well, just like Ella had. But this time around, it wasn’t too hard to discern what had happened. Mr Fuzzycheeks cage was back in pristine condition, and he was his happy little self. Squeaking along as if nothing had happened.

I thought about. . .disposing of him. But I couldn’t bring myself to do it. It wasn’t his fault anyways. He was just a hamster. For reasons I still don’t know, Isobel and Ella did what they did of their own accord. One look at his cute little face told me all I needed to know. *How could a little meat potato even begin do something like this?* I would keep him, I decided.

*Plus, look how hungry he looks.* I smiled as I chucked yet another carrot into his cage.
