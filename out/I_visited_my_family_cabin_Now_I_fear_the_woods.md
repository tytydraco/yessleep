I was never afraid of the forest.

I wandered off into the woods for the first time when I was three. I have a fuzzy memory of the event. I remember the door to my trailer home being open, and hearing someone call to me.

I was missing for five hours. My parents combed the forest, calling the police, rallying neighbors and family in an enormous search effort.

Eventually, my dad found me two miles from home, staring at a bobcat with wide eyes and a slack jawed expression. I wasn’t hurt. I cried when they took me back home. I wasn’t ready to leave yet.

My parents stopped discouraging my wanderings when I was eight. I guess they were tired of trying to find ways to trap me in the house. I started doing overnight trips by myself when I was twelve. I’d go deep into nearby national parks with some snacks, a tarp, a flashlight, and gaze at the stars.

In these moments, I liked to pretend I could hear the woods speak. I would close my eyes and listen to the wind, the way it shuffled the branches and rippled in the pine needles. I would try to find words in the cacophony, organize them into something I could understand.

In those words, I imagined, were the secrets of the universe.

Then came the summer I visited my Grandfather’s Cabin.

The Cabin, as we called it, had been in our family for generations. It was a small piece of land in the heart of the Cascades. It was the homestead of our ancestors who had traveled from Europe and then across America looking for a new life.

It was an open secret in my extended family that for generations, the head patriarch would choose one member of the rising generation to stay a week at the Cabin. It was seen as a birthright of sorts, a sacred trust.

I first heard the story when I was four. Even then, I understood how special the Cabin was.

I wanted to go, to be there. I wanted to be chosen.

When I was sixteen, my dreams came true. Grandfather sent me a letter, inviting me to stay with him for a week at the Cabin in the early summer.

My parents cried when I got the news. I almost cried too, I was so happy. I immediately began packing, speculating about what my Grandfather would teach me, thinking about all the hunting, fishing, and exploring that I was going to do. Sometimes, when I took a break from my imaginings, I would see my parents staring at me, sometimes almost on the verge of tears. At the time, I interpreted this as a sign I was growing up. I wasn’t their little boy anymore. This trip to the Cabin was a sign of manhood for me. They were letting go of their son and seeing him off into the world.

I gave them their space. I didn’t want to make things harder.

The entire drive to the Cabin, I had a difficult time sitting still. I had wanted to drive up on my own–I had just gotten my license–but my parents insisted on taking me. I knew I was supposed to be acting like a man, but I felt like a little kid on Christmas morning. I just couldn’t wait to be there.

On the way, I stared out the window and observed the forest. While we started on paved roads, we quickly turned down a dirt path full of bumps and divots. The trees grew dense, like walls on either side of us. The path grew narrower, and even though it was early in the day and sunny, the light grew dark and warped. I rolled down the window, and the pine smell flowed in thick and wrapped itself around me. I breathed deep and felt myself relax.

This was where I wanted to be. I could die here and be happy.

Before I knew it, we were there.

I had only seen pictures of the Cabin, mostly in some of my Aunties’ (and one Uncle’s) scrapbooks. I recognized the Cabin, but it was different to see it raw and not through some chemical reaction of light and silver accomplished decades ago.

It was older than I imagined.

The Cabin was made from interlocking logs that formed a structure seven feet high. The wood was darkened with age and mildew, and moss was punched into the sides, spilling out in herniated clumps. The door was the pale tan of dead timber, a shorn antler which protruded sharp and angular like a broken rib acting as a door handle. Dark windows allowed for a slight glimpse of the inside, but the old blown glass was warped and foggy in places like man-made cataracts. The roof was slanted to one side in a great diagonal, and shingled with bark skinned from trees and cut to proper shape. A metal pipe serving as a chimney pierced its roof, and small breaths of smoke emerged in tempoed coughs. 

I almost believed that this structure grew straight out of the ground itself. It seemed to me like a living thing.

I loved it.

The door opened, revealing the inner dark, and my Grandfather emerged from within.

He was an intimidating man. Tall, gray, thin. But there was a strength to him that I admired, worshiped even.

Grandfather looked at me with serious eyes, black and deep, underneath thick eyebrows perpetually pulled into a deep frown. He extended a hand, and I shook. I gathered up my bags and pulled them to the Cabin’s door. I saw him talk to my parents in low tones. He didn’t need to whisper. I knew not to disturb them. Grandfather came from a different era, and he expected respect. 

I was more than happy to give it to him.

Once they were done talking, my parents said goodbye. My dad was more serious than I had ever seen him, and my mom was crying again. Seeing them like this cracked my new “man” facade. I understood that things would never be the same after this trip. But my excitement soon overtook me. This was my moment to prove I was an adult, to prove my worth, my mettle. I assured them that I would be safe, that I would listen to my Grandfather. I would come back to them in one piece. 

They nodded, accepting my promises, while my mom still wiped away tears.

After one last hug, they got into the truck and drove away. I watched until they turned the bend, smiling and waving, and saw their car disappear, swallowed up by the immensity of the forest.

Grandfather helped me carry my things inside. I made sure to thank him, and to hold the door for him when he came through. I was surprised to find that the inside of the cabin had modern conveniences. Grandfather explained he had tried to keep the Cabin in its pristine condition, but necessity meant installing a generator and electric lights.

It was dark in the mountains at night.

Grandfather told me that he needed to run an errand before we began our time together. He asked me if I would be okay remaining in the Cabin on my own for an hour or two. I agreed. He left, closing the door with a snapping noise that made my bones tingle.

I unpacked, and began exploring the Cabin.

It did not take long to go over every part of it. The room itself was twenty feet square, and almost entirely filled with furniture and life necessities. There was a simple spring cot in the corner, a sink opposite, and shelving for survival materials–lanterns, tarp, rope, etc.--in the far corner.

I noticed something on the shelf that caught my attention. I made my way to it.

It was a letter. Written on the front was one word in my Grandfather’s handwriting:

“Grandson.”

Why was there a letter addressed to me? From the way it was positioned, I knew I was meant to find it, but why hadn’t he just given it to me when I had first arrived? I looked at it for a moment, before my curiosity got the better of me. I took it from the shelf, and found it was unsealed.

I slid the inside pages from their casing. They contained only a few short lines.

*Grandson. Before I left, I told you I would be gone for an hour.*

*That is a lie. I will not return until the end of the week.*

Initially, I felt more confused than frightened. I had wanted to spend time with my Grandfather this special week. Wasn’t that the whole point of this visit?

*I invited you here, because you are unique. There is the old blood in you. I have seen it manifest all your life.*

*You are of the old stock, and I believe you will one day take my place here.* 

*But first you must be tested.*

The excitement I felt now was greater than it had been before. Everything that I had hoped was happening. I had the old blood, whatever that meant, and I was special. I loved being special.

I was determined to prove myself worthy.

*For the next week, you will live alone in the Cabin as its caretaker. I will observe your stewardship from afar.*

*You must not leave the property, no matter the circumstance. This place is the heritage of our family. To abandon it would be to abandon us.*

*If you endure, then you will have proven yourself worthy of our family legacy, and of my trust.*

*Make us proud.*

*-Grandfather*

I was filled with relief and glee when I saw those words. I had plenty of food and water, Grandfather had shelves of preserves and racks of dried meat set throughout the space. The wood box also was well stocked for the cold mountain nights. I had survived much harsher conditions with much less.

This was going to be easy.

That night, when I crawled into my sleeping bag with a belly full of fruit preserves, pickled cabbage and dried venison, I felt peaceful. I dozed off listening to the sounds of night birds and the quiet breathing of the wind off the mountain.

I woke to the sound of silence.

In all my experience in the natural world, there is one constant truth: nature is noise. Sound is the reminder that life expands to every space available. Even in a thimble of water, a galaxy of species exists solely to take up space, to use every resource possible just because it can.

Life is greedy. And not easily silenced.

But that morning, I heard nothing.

It was dark outside. For a moment, I was worried I had gone deaf. But the sound of my sleeping bag shuffling underneath me on the floor let me know that my ears still worked.

I shook off my worry. I had never been in this part of the Cascades before. I told myself the silence was something normal I just was not used to. I got up, turned on the lights, and lying at the door was an unadorned envelope.

I hadn’t heard anyone come in the night, but I assumed this was Grandfather’s doing. Looking at the envelope, I felt a strange twinge of unease I took for nerves. I wanted to make him proud.

I got the envelope and opened it.

Inside was a single sheet of paper. On it, were written a few lines.

*In the old country, our ancestors were farmers. They took their living from a land that seemed to decide their lives with a coin toss. The scales between life and death were easily tipped in those days.*

*In one harsh winter, our clan was wiped out. Exposure froze some, hardening their flesh and bursting their veins with ice crystals. Beasts ravaged others, laying open their ribs and feasting on the sweetmeats inside. Famine killed the most, their bodies falling victim to the knives and forks of others, the survivors going mad and dissolving to dust from the slow march of time.*

*In the end, all but two died.*

I was sixteen. I didn’t know any better. I trusted my Grandfather. I believed this was a lesson. I thought about what the letter said during breakfast. I tried to reason out what it was. Was it a story? A riddle meant to be solved? I was so deep in thought, that I almost missed what was right outside the window.

Eventually, I caught it in my periphery, and did a double take.

It was a bird. A dead bird.

I looked out the window for a moment to confirm I was seeing what I thought I was. But the glass was too hard to see through, so I opened the door and stepped outside.

It was a crow, laid on its back with its wings spread out like it was taking flight. Its entrails poured out over its feet like vines, the inner flesh so crimson it was almost black. It might have been a trick of the light, but I thought I could see the organs still pulsing with life.

I took a moment to stare at the creature.

I decided it was some big cat’s forgotten lunch. I knew there were plenty of bobcats in the area.

I shook myself from my fixation. There were chores to do before dark.

I tried to ignore the bird as I fetched water, weeded the foundation of the house, and swept out the Cabin’s interior. But my gaze kept being pulled back to the corpse with some morbid fascination. Each time I looked, tingles would run up my spine.

I was halfway through chopping wood when the second bird appeared.

I almost dropped the kindling I was carrying. The second bird, also a crow, was laid out next to the first, its body butchered in a similar manner. Its feet stuck up like crooked crosses from the mess of its insides. Flies buzzed, already feasting on the smooth obsidian orbs that had once constituted its eyes.

One bird, I could ignore. Two, there was trouble nearby.

I retrieved my hunting rifle and began to scan the tree line. I was worried about mountain lions. I searched for tracks, anything to indicate what had brought these birds here.

Nothing.

I took a moment to breathe. I did another sweep of the perimeter. Again, no tracks, no signs. 

I was thirsty, so I went inside for a quick drink.

When I emerged again, the ground was littered with the dead.

Beasts large and small, deer, bobcats, mice, rabbits, all butchered in various ways. Some had their heads severed from their bodies hanging on by just a ribbon of flesh. Others were fully eviscerated, their offal spilling out across the ground, forming images of strange creatures undreamt of by nature itself. Blood and viscera splattered everywhere with an artistic flair and savage instinct. Intestines wrapped around limbs, bodies hanging from trees, jaws slack and dripping bloody spittle.

I stared at it all for a moment in horror.

Then the stench came.

It enveloped me like a rolling wave, filling my nostrils completely. It replaced the air in my mouth with its foul gas, coating my tongue and making my stomach boil. I threw up. Each time I took a breath, I felt the temptation to drive heave. The air was metallic with decaying blood, yellow with the smell of rot.

I ran back into the cabin, slamming the door.

I spent the next several hours trying to patch every gap I could with my clothes. I ripped up my shirts and shoved pieces in the walls, underneath the door, the roof. But still, the stench found its way in. Eventually I resorted to filling my nose with toothpaste. The decay mixed with the mint in a terrible way, and the paste itself burned my nostrils, forcing tears to my eyes, but it was better than the alternative.

And yet, I could still taste the bitterness of death on my tongue each time I drew breath.

I didn’t eat that night. I slept with my sleeping bag over my head.

I massaged the horrifying truth of what lay outside the door into something I could swallow, something I could ignore. I reminded myself of wolves, of predators, pack animals that could cause the carnage that I saw. And in my sixteen-year-old mind, this was sufficient.

I couldn’t risk imagining what unknown terror could cause something so heinous.

I made sure the doors were locked. I fell into a fitful sleep, waking up every hour to the smell, and having to re-block my nose with fresh minty paste.

When I woke up the next morning, I was exhausted. But something had shifted.

The stench was gone. 

I hesitantly peered out the window.

The bodies were gone.

It was quiet again.

I tried to comprehend what was happening. For a long moment, I worried I had imagined the whole ordeal. But the toothpaste still circling my nose and staining my pillow told me that something had happened.

I was starting to panic.

But I was distracted by something I had overlooked in my morning observations.

There was another letter by the door.

I slowly took it, opened it, and slid out the contents. I recognize my Grandfather’s handwriting.

*The two that survived that winter, a man and wife, sought the aid of a stranger.*

*The stranger was a known worker of miracles. In years past, he had impregnated infertile ground so it might beget generations of crops. He had wrestled plagues from power and forced them into servitude. He had taken stinking corpses, three days old, and raised them up to living.*

*Our ancestors went to the miracle worker. He heard their plight.*

*He would rebuild their clan. But of them, he required a price.*

The letter meant one thing: Grandfather was close. I wanted to go and find him, ask him what the hell was going on. I went to look where I put my hunting rifle the previous day.

It was gone.

I turned the little Cabin upside down. No gun. And if Grandfather had any guns they were gone too. I nervously picked up the wood axe from the corner. It wasn’t much, but it would have to do. Even so, I felt naked with such a primitive weapon.

I had just stepped outside when I heard the screams.

On a hunting trip with my dad, a mountain lion had cried out in the night. It sounded like a woman lost, in pain, afraid for her life. It had been one of the only times that I’d seen my Dad scared. He made us pack up and move our camp.

This scream was a hundred times more terrifying.

The sound was full throated, explosive. It made me drop my axe. There was a moment of silence, and then it began again. It was no animal I had ever heard before. It was suffering condensed, forced into the form of noise. It trembled at the high notes, broke in the low ones. It lasted long, far beyond any natural lung capacity.

I knew one thing. I did not want to run into the creature that made those cries.

I shut and locked the door to the Cabin.

For the rest of the day, I heard more screams. They grew progressively closer, and would chill my bones and make my entire body shake. I blocked up the windows and tried to cut out the sound with my hands. It only grew in intensity and volume, coming from multiple directions. At one point, I heard them directly outside the Cabin, overlapping and shifting. I couldn’t gather the courage to look outside.

Then the screams began to change.

The voices shifted. I heard the screams of my mother, my father. My cousins. So utterly human, so terribly in pain. They became louder and louder, forming words and begging me to come out to save them. They were in pain, they were being tortured. They were being torn apart, gutted, crucified, and only I had the ability to save them. Only me, and I needed to come out. I needed to save them.

I couldn’t. I couldn’t leave.

Eventually, I tore open my sleeping bag and shoved the polyester lining so far into my ears one of my eardrums burst. Blood poured from my ear, soaking into the synthetic cotton and pouring down my neck.

I could still hear the screaming.

The voices continued all night, and in the dark I felt my mind slipping, and in the place between waking and dreaming, I saw visions of my family dead, strung up by their necks and their limbs pulled apart layer by layer, their last horrific cries on their faces.

It felt real, and I felt some strange dread that I would join them.

But when the first rays of sunlight broke through my window coverings, it was silent again.

I lay in the dark, and I tried to keep from crying.

I missed my Grandfather, my parents. Why had they left me here? Why was this happening? All notions of proving myself were gone. I wanted to survive, to see them again. I needed to get out of here.

I cautiously took down the window coverings. There was nothing outside. However, as the light of a new day flooded inside of the cabin, I saw something else.

Another letter was at the door.

Against my better judgement, I opened it.

*In time the woman bore a child.*

*The son was unique. He possessed the blessing of the forest, and the land produced food abundantly under his care. The mother and father thanked the miracle worker for his miracle, and for many years they were content.*

*But there was a price yet to be paid.*

I could not wait for anyone to rescue me. My Grandfather was watching me suffer without lifting a finger. He would not help me, no matter what I experienced.

I needed to leave on my own.

I thought that if I started out now, I could get out of the woods while it was still light, get back home to my parents. I had to try. I didn’t care about responsibility anymore. I didn’t care about respect or heritage.

I just wanted to escape.

I gathered my things, picked up the axe, then opened the door to the cabin and stepped outside.

It was pitch dark on the mountain.

Where only moments before the sun had shown, the sky had flipped into night. The ceiling of the world was black and impenetrable, like a cloudy night in winter. A chill wind blew, and the clatter of branches reminded me uncomfortably of bones.

I didn’t have time to wonder how it had happened. I pressed forward, desperate.

I had a flashlight in my pack. I turned it on and walked down the road I had arrived on only days previously. It had felt like years since then. I walked with a purpose, trying to make as little noise as possible. I left the lights on in the Cabin, and the door wide open. 

To be honest, I wasn’t brave enough to turn them off.

For hours, I walked in the dark.

It was silent for a majority of my journey. But even still, I jumped at the sound of my own footsteps. I constantly turned my head to account for my newly deaf ear. I cowered at the shape of trees as they were revealed by my flashlight.

I realized that for the first time in my life, I was afraid of the forest.

My eyes were opened. It was as if the trees themselves had worn masks, and only now the curtain had been pulled away, revealing their true and sinister forms. In the half-shadows made by my flashlight, I believed I saw enormous forms, glowing eyes, the spreading of horrible wings of leather and teeth of wine stained ivory. I heard the thud of feet and the groan of ligaments.

In that dark, I saw the monstrous form of nature, unhidden at last.

I moved my flashlight, and the vision vanished.

It took all my courage to continue.

I walked for hours. I wondered how I would know if I had finally escaped. I wondered if the sun would reappear, and I would be able to relax, to go back to how things had been before. Maybe this was a dream, and I would wake up back home, safe and at peace. As I thought this, I saw a glow in the distance.

I walked toward it, eager. Maybe this was another cabin, other people able to help me, someone to relieve me from this hell.

When I finally got near enough to see what it was, my heart sank.

It was the Cabin. It’s door open, light beckoning.

Six times. That’s how many times I ventured out. Each time, all my paths led back to the Cabin. I must have wandered for a day and a half, stomach collapsing with hunger, throat burning with thirst. Each time I returned, I set out again, hoping that there would be something more to find.

But the night never ended, and in the end, all paths led to the Cabin.

On the sixth time, I broke. I curled upon the grass and sobbed. I screamed at the heavens. I begged for my mother to come get me, my father. I pleaded for my Grandfather for mercy. I understood the test, and I no longer wished to participate. I didn’t care what heard me. I was done. It was over.

When I stopped crying, I slowly got up, and made my way back through the Cabin’s front doors.

I don’t know how I slept. All I remember is waking. There was light coming from the windows, and my eyes were crusty from where the tears had dried. 

Illuminated by a beam from the rising sun, was another letter. 

I opened it with numb fingers. 

*When the child was of age, the miracle worker came to exact his price.*

*The man and woman took their child, and led him deep into the woods.*

*They tied his hands. They bound his feet.*

*Then they left him.*

*For what is of the forest, must return.*

It took an hour for my sleep addled and starved mind to understand.

I was going to die.

I couldn’t escape what was going to happen. This had been the intention from the beginning. Why I had been asked to come. For a while, I felt nothing.

Then I became angry.

Why? Why? *Why?* Why were they killing me? Because of a story? A family legend? I felt my hands shake. The paper crumpled and ripped in my fists. Grandfather had said that this Cabin was our family's legacy, and by enduring, I could prove myself worthy of that heritage.

Fuck heritage.

My hands and arms moved of their own accord. I was only vaguely aware of my surroundings, still reeling from the knowledge of my true purpose here. When I finally checked to see what I was doing, I was splashing gasoline from the generator on the side wall of the Cabin, soaking the moss with the accelerant.

And dousing the pile of kindling I had arranged against the logs.

I needed to burn it all down.

I moved like a desperate animal. I fumbled with the flint, pulling my pocket knife out and striking at it the starter’s weathered surface. I showered a constellation of sparks with each strike. I cut the tip of my finger from my hand, and sliced open my palm in the fervor of my movement. Blood welled up and spilled out in cherry droplets, splashing on the wood and staining it. Yet, I didn’t stop until I saw the flame catch, and begin to spread.

It grew uproariously, like something alive, and it fed eagerly on the mixture of gas and wood I had provided.

As the fire grew, I moved on to the forest.

I piled kindling at the tree line, small wooden constructions I then connected with a trail of gasoline. It took one strike to set the whole chain alight. The few days of summer we had experienced created a bed of dead needles that lay like a blanket underneath the pines circling the Cabin. 

Before long, the trees themselves joined the conflagration.

Smoke was thick in the air, billowing black like angry spirits, and I breathed it in deep. It stuck to my lungs and forced me to cough, but still I inhaled.

In the smog, the wall of flame cut a glowing halo around me. I thought I saw figures in silhouette circling me and the Cabin, held back by the advancing flame. I was baptized in the sweat that the heat drew from my body. I screamed, I cried, I wailed. I danced some forgotten movement drawn from within the deepest reaches of my DNA, the parts I still shared with our first ancestors who dwelt in caves. I shook my fist at the figures, cursing them, mocking them. I saw the axe where I had dropped it in the grass. I took it up and bashed in the Cabin windows, shattering them with such force that the glass punctured my arms, slicing the flesh in jagged lines like roots. 

I didn’t stop. Not even when the fire crept to the grass around my feet, and I felt the sweet tickle of flame as my clothes melted and came alight with the chaos incarnate, sizzling pain that brought the smell of roasted flesh and the bitterness of burnt hair to my nostrils.

I collapsed.

I stared at the Cabin, feeling my flesh being eaten away, my vision turning into a dizzying pattern of red, orange, and yellow. My head grew light. I closed my eyes, and drew in my final breath. I took in smoke until I was sure I would burst with it. And even amidst the cries of my lungs and the weeping and blistering of my flesh, I was content.

I had won.

\-

I woke two weeks later in the hospital, covered head to toe with third degree burns. The doctors told me they had no idea how I had survived. The fire rangers had caught a glimpse of me shaking and rolling in the flames when they came to investigate the source of the enormous pillar of smoke.

They had saved me. A miracle.

My parents never came to visit me. According to CPS, when they went to check on their mobile home, they found an empty lot.

The rangers claimed the Cabin was never there. I had burned away a section of protected forest, and at the center of the blaze was a circle of hard packed dirt. No structure.

I never saw my Grandfather again. I sometimes believe he’s out there, still observing the results of my stewardship.

After a year of recovery I was tried as an adult for arson. I pleaded guilty on all counts. The sound of the gavel declaring my incarceration was a sweet sound, one of safety. It meant concrete walls, iron bars, plastic trays. Dead things.

I was far away from nature. I was protected.

But even now, years later, in the night I hear the call. It wakes me from sleep, and raises me like one dreaming. To my ears, it brings the whisper carried by the wind I heard as a child. I listen to the words, even though I know I shouldn’t. I press my face as close to the outside as I can, feel the imprint of the bars on my window, and how they eat into my flesh.

I breathe deep. Sometimes I taste pine.

And when I stare out of the cramped window of my cell toward the distant forest, my scar swirled skin and aching mind desperately try to remember the flames, the stench, the screams, anything to keep me here, to make me stay.

Yet, I still feel the pull of the woods.

And I fear how much I desire to return.
