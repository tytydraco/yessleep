Do you believe in curses?

It’s a strange way to start a story, I know. Something for kids, right? But the truth is, over time, some memories gain weight. And my memories from that time… well, I can’t guarantee I understood everything I saw. Back then, my uncle used to say there were things in this world that shouldn’t be seen. I’d laugh, thinking it was just another one of his scary stories to spook us kids. But on a warm full-moon night, out on the ranch, I learned not all stories come from imagination.

It was the first time I’d heard the ranch dogs bark like that, like they’d seen the devil himself. The cattle were restless, mooing into the dark early hours, and a chill ran down my spine. My uncle appeared in the kitchen, rifle in hand, his face marked by a fear I’d never seen before.

“Stay inside. And if someone knocks on the door, don’t open it,” he said firmly.

I didn’t even ask what was going on. He looked too serious, almost sweating. He walked out, disappearing into the brush, the glow of his flashlight swaying in the darkness. And I stayed behind, alone, every noise outside taking on a different weight, every second stretching longer than the last.

It wasn’t long before I heard a scream coming from the woods—but it wasn’t the scream of any animal I knew. It was something between a wail and a human voice, distorted and loud, like a massive mouth trying to speak. The moment I heard it, a chill ran down my back, and I wanted to run. But instead, I froze, eyes locked on the closed door.

My aunt, who’d been in the bedroom, rushed into the kitchen. She didn’t say a word, just grabbed my hand and looked at me with a terror I’d never seen before. Occasionally, she murmured under her breath, clutching a crucifix. We stayed there, in the dark, just listening to the night, the sounds of the struggle outside, and those terrible screams.

When the sounds finally stopped, the silence was so absolute it was even scarier. After a few minutes, my uncle came in. He was covered in scratches and blood, though he didn’t seem hurt. His hands shook as he set the rifle down and looked at my aunt, like he wanted to say something but couldn’t. I stared at him, waiting for him to tell us what he’d seen, but he just shook his head and said, “It’s gone.”

In the days that followed, everything seemed to return to normal. My uncle didn’t talk about what happened that night, and my aunt only gave me silent glances, as if we were all wrapped in some dark secret none of us wanted to admit. But I knew something had changed. There was a strange tension in the air, and even the animals seemed more nervous, always on edge.

Then, one early morning, when everything was quiet, the screams began again. A high, drawn-out sound that cut through the dark like a warning. This time, I knew it was closer. It felt like the sound was coming from inside the ranch itself. The dogs, who usually barked, now only whimpered, as if they knew there was nothing to be done.

My heart raced, and I could barely breathe. I looked out the window and saw my uncle was already outside, rifle in hand. He seemed to be waiting for something. For a moment, I thought he looked directly at me, but then he turned away. He looked like he was making a decision.

When he raised his flashlight, the beam cut across the field. And for a second, I saw it: a grotesque, deformed silhouette moving in a way no animal ever would. It wasn’t an animal or a human. It was like the creature was made of mismatched parts, something that shouldn’t exist. And its eyes… they glowed brightly, reflecting the light of the flashlight like two embers in the dark.

The creature stood still, just watching. My uncle shouted something, an attempt to scare it off, but it didn’t seem afraid. After a few seconds, it turned and slowly disappeared into the darkness.

The next morning, I found my uncle in the kitchen, staring out at the field through the window as if he could still see the creature. I approached him and asked, with some fear, “It’s going to come back, isn’t it?”

He didn’t respond immediately, but I noticed he was holding something around his neck. A silver amulet. He sighed deeply and, without looking at me, said, “As long as there’s a moon, it’ll come back.”

The following nights were marked by an eerie silence. The ranch felt like a different place, as if it had been touched by a presence that was still there. My uncle stayed up all night, always near the window, rifle in hand.

Years later, after he’d become a widower, he called me to spend a few days at the ranch. But, to my surprise, as soon as I arrived, he told me, “It’s your turn now.”

I froze. I looked at him, confused, not understanding what he meant. But when the full moon returned, I understood what he was trying to say.

That night, I was alone. When the screams began again, I knew the cycle was restarting.

Outside, I heard heavy footsteps, like something gigantic and deformed walking slowly toward the house. I locked all the doors, secured the windows, and stayed in the dark, making no sound. And then, in the stillness of the night, I heard the most terrifying sound of all: Screams, roars, and something pounding and clawing at the door and walls of the house…

The blows were strong, constant, and menacing…

I thought the door wouldn’t hold and would give way to the creature at any moment.

It was as if it knew I was inside.

When dawn broke, I went to the door and saw deep claw marks etched into the wood, terrifying and unmistakable. Since then, I’ve lived knowing it will return.

Today, I look at my nephew sitting across from me, and I know it’s time to pass on the burden. He’s staring at me with a mix of disbelief and fear, but he has no idea what he’s about to face. I take a deep breath, holding the silver amulet that was my uncle’s, and hand it to him.

“You think this is just a story, don’t you? That I just want to scare you,” I say, holding his gaze. He swallows hard but doesn’t reply. “But you’ll hear those screams. And when the full moon rises, and that thing starts pounding at your door, you’ll understand.”

I pause, letting my words sink in. “Remember this, kid: the cursed never have children. That’s why the curse always passes to the nephews. And now it’s your turn.”

And just like my uncle did, I start walking into the forest surrounding our ranch to meet my fate. It’s the last time we’ll see each other. He stares at me, speechless, his eyes wide with fear. Deep down, I know he still thinks this is just a story. But tonight, when the first scream pierces the night, he’ll understand.
