Hunger once again led us down a risky path. 

The cobble way was lined with beautiful little gardens, bushes cut into shapes and dark green grass. The plants looked too healthy for getting almost no sunlight. But I haven't seen it rain once around here either so forget my concerns. 

We passed through the wooden arch and I took the lead, pushing open the dark, wooden doors. Immediately we were greeted by the smell of fat and sugar and so much more. It was overwhelmingly tempting to our empty stomachs. 

The interior was dark, dimly illuminated by matt, orange hanging lamps above each table. We slowly walked in and the doors closed behind us. It clearly was a restaurant, the sign didn't lie. There were hundreds of round, wooden tables filling the vast space around us. Each one occupied by up to four hungry guests, stuffing their mouths with food. The smell was heavenly. I couldn't figure out a single dish it could be coming from. It was a perfect mixture of all of them. 

We walked through the impossible large room, taking it all in. There weren't any walls in sight, the lamps in the back just got dimmer and dimmer until they ended in darkness. The walls must have been close from there. It already looked bigger on the inside than the outside. 

A bit further in we saw a massive buffet. At least as big as the courtyard store was. An area full of freshly cooked meals. People were filling their plates with loads of just everything. We saw different kinds of fried meats and vegetables, sauces, baked goods, and a lot of hard to identify stuff. There was no labelling on the trays so we were left to guess. 

Miranda took a plate and started looking through the delicious assortment. Most trays were already half or even fully empty. Not a good sign for all I had learnt so far. But that couldn't stop me from eating here. Miranda and I were split up by gnarling crowds pushing between us to get closer to the food. I tried to keep her in my view while we chose our dinner. 

We met again in search of a free table. It took quite a while until we found one. Miranda's plate was full of what looked like tiny chicken wings and vegetables. I chose one of the weirder things out of curiosity. Something deep fried that looked like it could have been a fruit. It was cut in half circles with strings pulled from the inside like molten cheese. It tasted breathtaking, not like a fruit at all. I never had anything comparable. 

We sat at a table not too far from the buffet area. I could still see the waves of people rushing in and out. Miranda sat with her back to it. Her view was more mysterious. 

There was an elevator door in the wall across from her. It only had a "down" button, but that made sense since there wasn't another story visible from the outside. I turned towards it maybe a little too often. 

"You wanna see what's down there, right?" Miranda asked. 
I sure did, but more than that did I want to keep the both of us safe. I thought, the further we would get into one of those buildings, the more dangerous it would be. 
"That's not the priority. I mean, I would love some more information about all this, but it's most likely not worth it. I'm just worried there could be something coming up from the basement." Miranda chuckled. 
"Don't worry, I've got an eye on it." 

After we finished our plates we decided to get another serving. This was probably the last time we would get to eat like this before we inadvertently had to explore the forest area, so we better make it count. 

We even packed some food into our bags. The chances it would survive a day out there were slim but there was no alternative option. On the way I observed the people around us. The citizens of limit lane city were all rather slim and humble. They were used to rationing their food and established different shopping habits to avoid getting caught in the gods' sacrificial games. The guests here were different. They had the bodies of people who spent all day eating. 

They behaved differently as well. Where the city folks would take only what they need and share, these guys would fight over each piece, even if there was more than enough available. Was this restaurant really a place people would live at? It must be so, I hadn't ever seen a person outside. I doubt anyone here would leave any time soon. But how could a person live here? Where would they sleep? Again my attention shifted to the elevator. Maybe this was just their version of the courtyard and the rest of the city was down there.

"Hey Luke" Miranda interrupted my thoughts. 
I looked back at her. 
"Where do you think we end up when we find the staircase? I mean, I surely didn't go down the same as you did when you ended up here." 
"Why do you think so?" I took bites off the little pastries I got us between my sentences. 
"You mentioned something about a street and snow. There wasn't a street where I found my staircase." 
"Where did you find.." 

I froze as I saw him. Miranda turned to see what I was seeing. It was the skeleton god. He just stood there, watching. What was he doing here? Was it the same guy even? Were there multiple? He slowly turned his head around and walked towards the buffet. I didn't move and Miranda didn't make a sound either. We just stared ahead with wide eyes. As the god reached the area, the customers that used to crowd this little island now quickly made their ways back to their tables. There were so many questions popping up in my head, I could barely concentrate on what I was seeing. As the last of the people scattered away, the god turned and held up a tiny brass bell. With a slight shake of his bony hand, the bell rang. 

The sound was so intense and all encompassing. I bet it could be heard in every corner of the room. With the ringing of the bell, all other sounds ended in an instant. We kept watching. The guests now all turned their attention to  something on their tables. Me and Miranda had to look down as well. 

Where our plates used to be, there was now a single, white sheet of paper. Two fortune cookies were placed upon it. The paper read simply "The Bill" in bold, black letters. I picked up the sheet and turned it around. There was nothing else on it. Cracking noises started to emerge from all sides. They were opening the cookies. 

I felt a shudder running down my spine. Something about all this was very wrong. Miranda hesitantly picked up one of the cookies. I took her hand, keeping her from opening it. How should we know there wouldn't be something bad happening if we did? By the time my eyes drifted from her back to the buffet, the god had vanished. We both looked around, searching. He was nowhere to be seen. 

I observed the guests at the tables next to us instead. They cracked open the pastry, took a look inside and ate the whole thing. I picked up my cookie. They must have known how to proceed. Learning from the people around me has always kept me safe so far. This didn't seem to be about choice. 

I let go of Miranda's hand. We both held our respective fortune cookies and stared at it for just a moment. I broke mine first. It crumbled easily between my fingers. I was surprised to find it completely empty. Miranda has been watching me, she didn't know how to interpret this either. 
"Must be a good thing", my mind tried to make me believe. Now it was Miranda's turn. I could tell she was nervous. She took each half in one hand and broke it in the middle. Before we got a look inside I already heard the terrifying scream.

Luckily, it wasn't coming from Miranda. A middle aged woman on a table about ten meters from us looked up at the empty face of the skeleton god. He was bending over the table uncomfortably. I think she held a little piece of paper in her hand, it was hard to tell from this distance and lighting. His voice was coming from everywhere all at once. 

"Ah! Valerie, my dear friend. It seems it's your turn to pay the bill." 
A bleached white hand was held out for her to take. The whole room was silent and all eyes, without exception, were on Valerie. She took the gods hand and let him help her up. Together they walked towards the elevator. The god pressed the button, the doors opened smoothly. The cold white lamp inside the elevator was almost blinding to look at. My eyes had gotten so used to the dim lanterns. They disappeared into the cabinet and the doors closed behind them. They were gone for a while. It must have been minutes but felt like hours of silence. Then the doors opened again.

The skeleton god stepped back into the dining hall, alone. Valerie wasn't with him anymore. He held out both hands towards the buffet. It was now once again overflowing with freshly cooked food. Most of it was still steaming. It looked so delicious. 
"Eat!", he said. 
And with that signal the masses got back up and ran towards the trays. The meals' spell almost caught me as well, but I could keep myself from running. This place was dangerous. The entrancing effects the food had were no longer deniable. 

I stood up from the table and grabbed Miranda's hand. 
"We need to get out!" 
She didn't answer but she followed. As soon as we were out the door, it felt like I could finally breathe again. Like something was missing all this time and I didn't realise until I had it back. We sat for a while, leaning against the red, wooden arch. We should have just gotten up and continued our journey, but we couldn't. I couldn't. I needed answers. 

"You want to see what's down there. If we don't check it out now we won't at all, you know? We won't be turning back again once we're in the forest." 
She was right. 
No matter how much I kept telling myself to stay away from risks, in the end it was useless. How should I even know what was a risk and what wasn't? 
"You don't have to come with me." 
"I will though." She smiled. 
I took one last deep breath of the outside air in hopes it would keep my mind safe from the corruption. We went back in. 

We walked straight for the elevator. There was no one in our way. Not even the god was there to stop us. I expected him to appear behind us at some point, telling us we were not supposed to go there. He didn't. I pressed the glowing downward pointing arrow. It took only a few seconds for the doors to open and for the bright light to hurt my eyes once again. We got in. 

The inside of the elevator was small, any more than two people wouldn't fit in here. On our way through the restaurant I kept debating if we should go to the lowest floor first or rather go down one floor at a time. Turns out there was no need to make such a decision. There were only two buttons inside the elevator. An arrow pointing down and one pointing up. 

We waited for the doors to close in front of us before we pressed the button that took us down. With a small jerk, the elevator sprang to life and began moving. Only a few seconds passed before it stopped again. As the doors opened, I was just confused. 

In front of us was the restaurant, just like we left it. But, no. It wasn't the same. The people were different. I remembered the couple sitting right across from the door. There were now three young men devouring a plate of spring rolls instead. I pressed the button again and again we ended in a hall full of tables and food. We went down many floors and with each one we found another dining room, stuffed to the max with eating people. After about seven or eight floors we decided to go back up. There was nothing down there after all. This could have gone on forever. I started to believe that the only reason the god brought Valerie in here was so there weren't any witnesses.
