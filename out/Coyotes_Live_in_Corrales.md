It started out as an embarrassment to our family, nothing more. When the New Mexico cops called my mom and told her about the state they’d found Nana in, it made us look like a bunch of jerks who didn’t even care about their dear old granny. Well, to be honest, we didn’t, but it was nobody’s fault. Nana was the kind of person who made it pretty hard to care about her. It wasn’t even *Nana’s* fault. If you’d had the kind of childhood she did, you would probably have ended up like that, too. Nana never really went into the specifics of what had been done to her, but if anyone brought up the past, she’d dramatically look off and say, “I was raised by wolves, you know.” My mother thought she did it for attention. “She wants to make you beg for the details,” she always said. “Don’t give her what she wants.” So I didn’t.

The cops didn’t understand all that, though. To them, it looked like we’d just left the woman to rot out in her dilapidated little farmhouse and forgotten her. Which I guess we kind of did. The phone call was the first time I’d thought of Nana in years. But we couldn’t be blamed for that, either; it was what was best for her. She’s the one who refused to be put into a nursing home. She wanted to die out on her own land, the land where she’d been raised (presumably not by actual wolves). That’s what we let her do.

My mother started to ask questions about which was cheaper, burial or cremation, when the cop said, “Oh no, ma’am, I’m so sorry for the misunderstanding. She was found *alive*.”

“Oh,” said my mother. That was another embarrassing thing: she so clearly sounded disappointed. “Well, I guess we’re going to have to figure something out, then.”

The bottom line was that Nana certainly couldn’t live alone in the farmhouse anymore. When they found her, she was passed out in her recliner chair. Besides the regular deformities of old age (her thigh fat folded over her knees and her calf fat folded over her ankles, and the top of her scalp had been rubbed raw), she was almost unscathed. But the house was overrun with the beasts of the American Southwest. If you lifted a cardboard box off of one of the corner piles, which had been there since long before Nana started to get senile, you’d see lizards skittering for shelter. Not only mice, but squirrels ate through every carton in the pantry. There were even a few bats living in the ceiling, they said. 

But by far, the coyotes were the worst. When they found her, there were three or four of them curled around her in the chair. Now, maybe you didn’t grow up in New Mexico, and maybe you’re picturing just a small wolf or a large dog. That’s not what coyotes are like at all. Coyotes are actually the same size as a lot of pet dogs, and a lot of the time they’re even smaller. They’re not like wolves; it’s not their size or their strength that makes them wild. It’s their faces. They have pinched, evil faces and human eyes. A coyote sneers at you down a long, long snout, and the snouts slither and twitch on their own, like snakes. They’re basically Doctor Suess creatures: their noses are too long and their bodies are bony and twisting, and their fur hangs off of them in mats. They sound more like hyenas than wolves. I always thought it was Nana who drove all the kids and grandkids out of New Mexico, but now that I think about it, it might have just been that we were desperate for a good night’s sleep. I certainly hadn’t missed the yipping and cackling of coyotes all through the night. 

Anyway. That’s what they found in Nana’s house: a coven of coyotes slinking around her unconscious body on tiptoe. They hadn’t hurt her, which wasn’t necessarily strange. Coyotes don’t usually attack people unprovoked, which, in my opinion, kind of just makes them scarier (if they’re coming after you, then you know it’s personal). There was evidence of a little bit of light gnawing on her arms, but nothing serious. Later, she’d insist to me that they were “love bites.”

The used dishes in the pile at her feet, the mysterious leakings that once stained the floors, and the old-person scabs up her arms and legs were all licked clean. Everything sparkled with coyote spit. It was probably the cleanest the house had been in years.

It would have been even *more* embarrassing if we allowed something like that to happen twice. Putting her in a home wasn’t really an option. We didn’t have the money for it, and Nana, still insistent that she was going to die on her own land, sure wasn’t going to fork over her fortune. Our family had risen and fallen within the span of her lifetime. She’d pulled herself up by her bootstraps, somehow, but the next generation had failed to follow suit, and she had no interest in helping us along. After all, no one had helped *her* (besides, she claimed, the wolves). 

My mother and my uncles wouldn’t move in with Nana. That was out of the question. One generation down, though, our hate for her was diluted. We could look at the woman without losing our minds. My mother encouraged me to take charge before any of my cousins got the chance. “Who knows,” she said, “Maybe she’ll leave you that goddam house, and then we can burn it down.”

I was in no position to be burning down houses, no matter how many ghosts from my mother’s childhood lived in them. In fact, I’d kind of been sleeping on friends’ couches ever since my mother decided I was no longer allowed on hers. The chance to live for free in an actual *house*, a place with multiple walls and a kitchen and air conditioning and everything, was too good to pass up, no matter how many bats, coyotes, and senile grandmothers lived there with me. So I went back to New Mexico. I figured it was only a matter of a year or two until the old woman died and I was the only member of her terribly embarrassing family that ended up in the will. 

When I finally got to the place, it was clear I wouldn’t even have to wait that long. She was already on her way out. Some good Samaritans had cleared out most of the junk and animal carcasses from the living room, and they’d even replaced Nana’s recliner with a hospital bed. I would have bet a million bucks that she was going to die right there, probably within the next few weeks. She lay shriveled up in the middle of the bed. They’d packed plastic pillows around her like ice on something dead kept fresh. Something like snail goo floated in her eyeballs, and her hands were thick with retained water. She grabbed me by the hand, which was almost as bad as anything that was to come, and called me by my uncle’s name. 

“No, Nana,” I said. “It’s me. I’m here to take care of you.”

“Headache,” she said.

I figured she’d endured enough by this point that a little headache wasn’t going to kill her. I tried to start getting things set up in my room, which was down the hall. She kept howling about the headache until I had one myself, so I went back out to the living room and fed her some Advil tablets. She refused to take them with water, like a little kid. I left the glass balanced precariously on the side table next to her bed. The police had so nicely cleared it, but its coat of tissues, half-full cups, dirty dishes, and tiny unidentifiable droppings was already growing back. I had to hide the pills in a thing of applesauce and trick her into swallowing them down like a dog. 

“Goodnight, Nana,” I said. It was barely evening, but when I turned off the lights she sighed and was quiet.

All that night, the coyotes made human noises in the fields around the farmhouse. They cried things that weren’t quite words, seeming to mourn the fact that they couldn’t speak English. At one point, I awoke to the sound of scraping on the front screen door. When I looked through the peephole and saw it was just coyotes, I grabbed a poker from the fireplace. My hope was that they’d stick around long enough that I could bash their brains in. But they knew what they were doing. When I caught them on the front porch like that, they sprung back and bugged out their guilty eyes. They flicked their foamy snouts at me. They stayed just long enough to tell me who was boss, then slunk back into the fields. They’d left wet teethmarks on the screen.

Nana slept through the whole thing. In fact, come morning, I kind of thought my job here was done, that all I had to put in was one rough night for the old woman to die painlessly in her sleep. But when I turned on the light to be sure, she sprung to life. Clawing at her eyes, she called out, “No, no!”

I turned out the light and stood over her bedside. I hadn’t gotten a good enough look at her to be sure, but it seemed like something was off. “Nana?”

Sure enough, when she lifted her hand to grab mine, her palm was prickly. She had feathers stuck between her fingers, feathers up around her ears, even feathers between her teeth. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I saw that the glue holding the feathers to her skin was red, and thick, and caked below the fingernails of her right hand.

My first thought was that she killed a chicken. That’s pretty stupid, I know, but I had coyotes on the brain, and you’ll come to realize that it’s not the craziest thing in the world, considering what came next. Then I noticed the plastic-covered pillows. They were split irregularly and covered in slobber. “Hey Nana, did you dream you were eating a giant marshmallow?”

She didn’t think that was funny. “I dreamt of wolves,” she said, and her eyes bugged out in that same asymmetrical, guilty manner as a coyote caught in the act. 

The blood came from one of the many minor wounds up and down her arms. Maybe it was one of the bites she got from the animals that briefly overtook her house; maybe it was one of the nervous scabs she’d picked into her dry skin long before. She gnawed or scratched it open in the night, along with her pillows. I don’t exactly know how to dress a wound, especially not in the dark, but I did my best with baby wipes and band aids. “No,” she pawed at the bandage. “It tingles.”

“That’s good,” I said, “Itching means that it’s healing.” The next time I checked on her, I pretended not to notice that the band-aid was gone and the scab scratched open again. She wouldn’t eat her lunch or even drink a glass of water. I left the full cup on the table to grow warm and filmy with the others.

We kept to ourselves, Nana and I. I spent the day unpacking my things and filling up the spare room that smelled like cat litter, even though, to my knowledge, Nana had never had a cat. I brought a TV that half-worked and a lot of books and my laptop. I figured that now that everything was relatively stable, I might finally get started on my novel. When I tried to write, though, only coyote-thoughts came to mind. In fact, that’s what you read earlier–my overwrought descriptions of Doctor Seuss creatures and slithering snouts. The blank word doc that was supposed to be my book became a list of notes on all the strange things that were happening out in Corrales, New Mexico. I made note of the blood, and the feathers, and even the joke about the marshmallow. I’d forgotten that I’d said that until just now, piecing my notes together. I’ve forgotten a lot of it. I’m glad I took those notes when I did. At this point, I’m able to go through and edit and turn it all into a coherent narrative, but I don’t think I could tell you the story on my own. My mind isn’t as sharp as it was even a few days ago. 

As I failed to write my book, Nana writhed in her hospital bed. It wasn’t my fault. I went out to check on her every once in a while, but she wouldn’t let me do anything to help her pass the time. I couldn’t turn on the TV or the lights or even open the windows. Since she’d been in the darkness all day, I had to alert her when it was time to go to sleep. “It’s night, Nana.”

“Can’t sleep,” she said. 

“Do you want some Advil?” But by that point, she wouldn’t even take the applesauce. “Goodnight,” I said, because there was nothing more I could do.

“Can’t sleep,” said Nana, but she stayed quiet once I was gone.

The coyotes were not so polite. I eventually fell asleep, but their yapping made me dream coyote dreams. So when I woke up and saw the shadow by my bed, my first stupid thought was that it was a coyote in the house. I yelped. The shape, which was crouched near the floor, rose onto its hind legs and said “Shh.” 

“Nana?”

She said something in reply, but it was in the same mournful language that coyotes use when they talk to each other in the night. When I tried to ask again, she butted her head against mine to shush me. I realized my forehead was wet where I’d touched her. She kept up at what she was doing before I woke up: smoothing back my hair with her own saliva. It wasn’t in the way that old ladies do, licking their fingers to wipe dirt off their grandkids’ faces, although maybe it came from the same instinctual place. It was the way that coyotes groom their young, direct transfer of spit from tongue to skin. It was the way that wolves would have raised her, if she’d been fortunate enough to have been raised by wolves.

Mostly out of shock, I let her keep up at it for the next few minutes. She spoke as she worked, but never in human language. The only time the coyotes fell silent was when she was filling the air with her own yipping, almost like they were communicating back and forth. I only stopped her when she nipped at my shoulder with her teeth. It wasn’t a hard bite; it only broke the skin at one tiny place. But it was a bit of a wake-up call to the fact that my grandmother was grooming me with her mouth. 

“Love bite,” she said in a small, somewhat embarrassed voice, and though I couldn’t see her eyes in the dark, I would have sworn they were rolling in two different directions like a frightened coyote’s. 

“Go to sleep, Nana.”

“Can’t sleep,” she said, but she left my room, and pretty soon her inhuman babbling died down.

I turned back over, but of course you can’t just go to sleep after something like that. It was too bright to sleep anyway. The full moon shone through the slats in the blinds. That was when I knew for sure that something was really wrong. 

You know, the word “lunatic” comes from “luna,” meaning moon. Back in the day, before they knew better, they thought that changes in the moon caused insanity. Maybe they noticed people doing strange things, keeping strange company. Drooling, biting, hiding from the light, gnawing through objects, disappearing in the night. That was what happened the night after the grooming incident: I woke up in the dark and the coyotes were quiet. I think that was what woke me up in the first place–I’d gotten so used to the howling that peace disturbed my sleep. Nana’s bed, still a little stained and feathery, was empty. 

I’m going to be honest with you: my first reaction was relief. If Nana wasn’t in the house, that meant that she wasn’t going to be drooling, biting, or gnawing on me. Then I drew the curtains and remembered the full moon. I went to the kitchen, telling myself that I was looking for her, but heading straight for the silverware drawer. I didn’t take a steak knife. I had no use for stainless steel. I went for the good silverware, the *real silver* silverware, and I stockpiled forks in my room. I hid them under my pillows, in my suitcase, in my pockets. I left one by my laptop so that I would always be ready to spring into action, just in case someone snuck up on me when I was recording my notes. I held the last silver fork like a dagger and came back to the living room to find Nana laying down but not asleep in her hospital bed. Her feet were bare and the soles were muddy. She twitched and mumbled, and I stayed put in my room for the rest of the night.

So what I mean to say is that there’s a precedent for this kind of thing. There’s a history of this disease. When they observed the psychos of the past going crazy with the full moon, perhaps they invented the word “lunatic” to describe something they didn’t yet understand. They had fairytales and folklore, of course, just as we have goofy horror movies and comic books. But they didn’t have *proof*, and neither did we. Until now.

I’m going to use the word lycanthropy. If I’ve lost you there, I understand. I wouldn’t have believed it either, had it not been for the feathers and the blood and the full moon and the drool and the disappearances and the animals in the house and the incessant howling in the night and the love bite on my shoulder. What other conclusion could I possibly draw? I’m really asking. Please, if you can think of any other explanation for all of those symptoms at once, let me know. It’s not like I *want* to believe that my grandmother was a werewolf. Tell me if you can think of any other way to explain the lycanthropic transformation that occurred on the last night of Nana’s life.

I put her to bed like normal, only this time, I had a real silver fork tucked up my sleeve. She fell asleep right away–no, that’s not true, she never really slept towards the end (and neither do I, neither do I). But she lapsed into a kind of unconsciousness, staring up at the ceiling. She lay still enough that I could take her wrists and lash them to the bars of her hospital bed, just in case. I used strips of sheet, and my knots were not as strong as they could have been. By that point, the tremors had already begun.

Only a few minutes after I’d gone back to my room, I heard a clatter from down the hall. I crept towards the living room in the dark, one hand brandishing my silverware, the other one palm out on my own back. That was how I always walked down dark halls at night as a kid, with one hand in front of me and one hand behind. The idea, I guess, is that you can touch the monsters before they touch you. But I wasn’t scared of ghosts or home intruders anymore. I knew exactly where the monster was waiting. She panted and tugged, sitting up but hunched over. Her left hand was still tied loosely to the bars, but the right was locked into a claw, as hard and as tight as rigor mortis.

“Nana?” I called out, which was a mistake. She wrenched around at the sound of my voice, and the last bit of cloth on her wrist snapped. Her freed hand jerked towards me, but before I could get a good look at her, she doubled over again. She’d begun to rot away while still alive in her bed. She hadn’t eaten anything since I’d come to Corrales besides a few pills, the mouthfuls of applesauce, pieces of her pillow, and her own scabs. Her shoulder blades flapped under her nightgown. As she breathed, the bits and pieces of her spine seemed to skitter up and down her back like rats. 

This is what I meant when I said that a coyote’s size is not what makes it scary. A big, strong coyote, a coyote as big as a wolf, will use its strong muscles to run back home to the fields. The small coyotes are the ones you need to worry about. There’s no telling what a starving animal will do. And worse than anything, you can’t even blame them.

I couldn’t blame Nana as she twitched towards me, not with the power of all my mother’s childhood trauma. I shared no blood with the creature in Nana’s nightgown. She was of another stock entirely, a sick breed that should have been culled in another time. Nana’s black eyes held two images of the full moon. Her arm bones heaved and sank in her sleeves. Her fingers stretched to three times their normal length, then curled in on themselves, making paws. 

When she swiped at me, my first involuntary thought was of the nail clippers in the little basket of supplies someone left on the kitchen counter before abandoning Nana to my care. It was a sort of care-and-keeping-of-your-old-lady starter kit, with all the Advil she wouldn’t eat and swabs in the place of toothbrushes. I’d hardly used any of it. I figured I’d get to it eventually, you know? She could wait for her lip balm and lotion and pedicure for a few days while I got settled in. By that point in the lunar cycle, though, there was no way the flimsy little clippers would have worked on her. You know how you have to be oh-so-careful when cutting a dog’s nails, because if you go even a little too close to the quick you’ll hit a nerve and blood will spurt everywhere? Her nails looked like that. I could practically see the capillaries branching out of her fingertips, traveling down the ridges in her overgrown claws.

I stumbled back but felt the wall behind me. I couldn’t quite think quickly enough to find another way out. By then, whatever got her was starting to eat at me, too. But I wasn’t far enough along to have the super strength and super speed that she did. Even as she twisted and jerked, she pulled herself up onto the bed with an agility she probably hadn’t used in a decade or two. She landed on her soggy sheets on all fours. Her arms, which must have gotten longer since I last looked, bunched up around her ears. Her hair had gotten longer, too. It wasn’t the neat old-lady pixie cut she’d had when I moved in. It grew down over her ears and on her forehead, over the back of her neck and around the collar of her nightgown in gray mats. I couldn’t be sure in the dark, but it looked like clumps were beginning to appear down her arms, as well. She might have grown enough to cover her whole body by midnight, if she’d been allowed to live that long. 

By far, her snout was the worst thing of all. Her face shifted before my eyes, swimming and rearranging, then coming back into focus as something slightly stranger each time. Her lips snarled back from their long, yellow teeth, and her drool began to lather at the corners of her mouth. She shook her jaws. That sent froth over her chin, into the air, and across my face. She was like a mad dog–no, she wasn’t, not precisely. She was beyond a dog, beyond a coyote, beyond even a wolf. But like a mad dog, there is nothing you can do for a werewolf on the hunt besides putting it down. 

It might not have been a bullet, but the silver fork was my best shot. I stabbed it out in front of me at the very moment she pounced.

I missed–my vision was blurring by then, as it is now, and my balance was off–but so did she. She landed not around my neck, but sprawled halfway off the bed, crashing into the cluttered bedside table. The glasses of rejected water toppled and broke. It soaked the front of her nightgown, and for one terrible moment, I saw the fabric go slick across the shape of her flesh. She reeled back; her chest was concave, her forgotten breasts shriveled, her neck marked with fresh scratches from throat to clavicle. That was the time to do it. She must have seen the silver coming, or maybe smelt it, because she stopped snapping and spitting. In those last few moments, she clutched at her own throat instead. She began to whimper.

I aimed for her soft underbelly. I was just a bit off; the fork stuck into her sooner than I thought it would, and the unexpected jolt sent me reeling. When I finally caught my balance and focused my eyes, I saw her lying in her sheets. She was still twitching, but the worst was over. The rage had gone out of her eyes. Her hair, it seemed, was already beginning to recede back onto her head. Right in the notch of her collarbone, glistening like a dog tag, was the real silver fork. 

Cardiac arrest, they said. Sure. Whatever helps you sleep at night. I took the fork out before the cops arrived. I didn’t want to seem suspicious, you know, and at that point, I wasn’t ready to come out with the whole truth. I didn’t want to believe it myself. I thought that maybe it was a fluke, a one time thing. I thought I could quietly inherit the house and die of natural causes in Corrales, New Mexico a long, long time from now.

But since that full moon, it’s only gotten worse. I can feel the sickness in all the same places she felt it–pounding in my temples, scratching in my fingernails, tingling in my bitemarks. Foaming at my mouth. The coyotes never shut up now, not even in the daytime. I keep the blinds drawn, but they scratch at the glass. They smell it on me. They must think I’m one of their own.

So this is a record of my last human words. The next full moon is a matter of days from now. I don’t know exactly what my full transformation may bring; I got to Nana with the silver before the worst of it set in. All things considered, this is maybe the best place for it to happen. There is no one out here besides me and the coyotes. Maybe, when I grow into my wolf teeth, I can tear them up, eat their hearts. That much is a consolation, at least. Still, I wish it didn’t have to happen this way. I wish I could go out in the sun one last time, but it burns my monster eyes. I wish I could eat and drink as a human does, but the thought of it brings spasms to my throat. My thirstiness has been replaced with bloodthirst. I do not want to drink. I want to bite.

Nana was afraid and confused, but I’m lucky enough to at least understand what’s happening to me. I am a werewolf like my grandmother before me. What other explanation could there possibly be?
