You know something, I'd *actually* managed to forget all of this shit until just a minute ago, after surfing FaceBook and seeing a post about someone finding the sibling they had no idea existed. I almost wanna turn this into a PSA about getting off social media, but I'm not *that* preachy. Look, it's not their fault, or FaceBook's, I'm just saying, shit brought back BAD memories for me, you know?

Well, okay, maybe you don't know. I hope you don't anyway. I wished *I* never did.

To begin this, you need to know that, for the longest time, I thought I had an imaginary "friend". Notice I use that term EXTREMELY lightly. Tell me, are friends supposed to tell you they hate you? Are friends supposed to tell you how they're going to kill everyone you love and care about? Well, mine did, constantly.

Most nights as a kid were spent with all the lights on the entire night (which you can imagine how long my folks were willing to put up with *that*), just to *maybe* get me to finally go to sleep. Oh, and obviously, my folks weren't believing me when I told them about my "friend". They'd tell me to tell him to go away, maybe cap him with my BB gun until he ran away, Hell, my Dad even told me I should punch him in the nose, "Teach him a lesson or two" as he'd put it. *Yeah, okay, genius, and what then, shake my finger and shout harsh words at him?*

See, even when I was little, I'd understood the difference between *actual* imaginary friends and whatever the hell this was -- "Real", I guess? By this I mean that, with imaginary friends, you ARE actually in control, you know? YOU make him appear and disappear, right, make him do whatever you want him to do, whenever and however you want him to do it. But I didn't have any of that, not here. Oh no, I had this.

I had the voice of a little boy just constantly hurling insults and threats at me. It wasn't JUST at night though, of course. No, this motherfucker followed me *everywhere!* In my bedroom, the bathroom, the tub (this one was a favorite for him -- especially when it came to telling me his to-do list of murders), outside at the bus stop, on the bus, at school, fucking *everywhere!* There was no running from him. No hiding from him. He, whoever the hell he was, was stuck to the hip with me.

Most of the time, I'd ignored his voice. Funny as it was, because of this, I'd actually find myself paying close attention to every word out of my teachers' mouths JUST so I could drown out his voice with SOMETHING. That worked (sorta) for about the first two or three years in elementary school, but come fourth grade, nope, nothing on this earth was keeping him out of my ears, literally. That was the first time I'd actually been admitted to the funny farm after a kid saw me run into the bathroom with one of my plastic forks I'd been using for my peas and carrots and attempt to drive them into my ears.

The school was put into lockdown for a bit after that, so I heard, and I was escorted to the principal's office by one of the S.R.O.'s and the assistant principal. They repeatedly asked me why I was trying to harm myself, including asking about my home life and if I was getting along with other kids here at school. I remember being silent. Not to be rude, of course, but more like I couldn't actually speak.

No, I don't mean being at a loss for words, either. I just couldn't say anything. I wanted to, but couldn't, no matter how hard I screamed at myself to do so. My folks were soon called, which then drew the process out a lot more and made shit a lot more complicated than I ever wanted it to be. To make this part of the story short, an ambulance was called and I and my parents were all escorted to the hospital, where I was checked in that afternoon and told that stuff from home would be brought to me the next day and that I would be staying there until I was "better".

*"Better... Heh, they actually said "'till I was better".*

Anyway, so I spent that night, and every night following for the next month and a half there in the psych ward. The place wasn't all bad, though. The nurses were nice, especially the gorgeous young CNA who'd wake me up every morning with a bowl of steamy hot cinnamon oatmeal, a banana, and a juice box along with a small cup of some sort of grape medicine. The place was actually friendly and inviting, with pictures of smiling children all along the wall, papier mâché, origami and even these quirky looking clay figures on shelves on the walls. All of this, and the other patients, the ones my age at the time anyway, were also really nice to me and fun to hang out with when we had commons time.

Being perfectly honest here, I wouldn't have minded any of this one single bit -- except for the fact that it *WASN'T FUCKING WORKING!*

Every night, I was still kept awake with his voice, his childish, growly sort of voice, teasing me, saying things like "Oh, isn't that cute, little Greggy's making a friend. Oh, aren't *you* just special?" I remember pressing the extremely fluffy pillows they'd given me against my ears and telling him to go away. "Oh? "Go away"? That's what you want? For me to "Go away"?" I remember how I heard him laugh. It sounded just like any other little boy's laughter, but coming from him, I couldn't help but associate it with the laugh I used to hear from the Joker in *Batman: The Animated Series*; demented and maniacal.

"And what if I don't wanna go, huh? You ever think about that?" he snapped back. I didn't answer, opting instead to pull the covers over my head.  "No, you only think about what *you* want, don't you?" I felt little indentations press into the blanket, like small fingers pushing into the comforters over my face. "What about me, huh, Greg?"

The fingers dug into the blanket, clenching it tight, like it was the only thing keeping him from falling or something. I began to feel the covers slowly pull away from me. I pulled them closer to my face. He chuckled at this.

"Aw, what's the matter? You shy? Huh, is that it? You're a shy little weasel? You know, I seem to remember Ma telling us that it wasn't polite to turn away from the person speaking."

"Us?" I remember asking. His giggling sounded absolutely demented this time.

"Yeah, *"Us"*. We're one in the same, Greggy-boy."

"What are you talking about? "The same", how?"

"Why don't you take the fuckin' blanket off, you little baby?" My body seized again from under the covers. His voice didn't sound like a child's anymore, instead like a full grown man; deep and commanding. The covers pulled up again but I snatched them back to my face. "You're gonna suffocate, doing that, Greggy."

"Just leave me alone!" I cried.

*"Leave me alone!"* he shot back in a falsetto voice. *"Go away, go away, boo-hoo-hoo! Poor wittle me, mean man won't weave me awone cause he's PISSED THE FUCK OFF!"* Those last few words echoed throughout the room in his demonic bellow. I was a statue under the covers, clenching them close to my face for dear life. A sickening second passed in complete silence. The air was both empty and suffocating at the same time.

Then the chuckling came back and he said, "Fine then. Since you love your little blankie more than me..." The air tightened. I started struggling for air. The laughing grew louder, the only thing I could hear over my gasping. The pressure in my head threatened to make it explode.

I was fading fast, clawing violently at the blanket over my face. Just before I was gone for the count, though, I saw the blanket get jerked off of me. Before the covers had even completely left my face, fresh air stung, billowing into my starving, gaping lungs. My vision was blurred and the room was dark. I began flailing at a pair of hands I saw grabbing at me.

I was a scared, wounded animal, backed into the corner. I knew if those hands grabbed me, the hands of *him*, whoever he was, then that was it for me. I didn't know what he'd do -- after all, right up until a second ago, I didn't even know he could actually *touch* me -- but I knew now that if I didn't fight my way out and run, suffocation would've been just a *kindness.* The hands were strong, big and calloused. I imagined him being an over 6'5" behemoth, broad shouldered and built like a goddamn heavyweight boxer. I could hear a voice, booming and deep, just like his, though I couldn't hear what he was saying. I didn't think he was speaking, not English anyway. It was all garbled, grumbling, like he was incapable of speaking, like he had his mouth too full or something.

I managed to send a swipe across his face, which had him reeling in pain. I took the opportunity and made a break for the door to my room. Just before I could make it to the door, his hands seized both of my arms and was dragging me back over to the bed. I could hear the garbling get louder, like he was shouting something, something I couldn't understand. I ignored this though and let my instincts kick in by reaching down and taking a chunk out of the fucker's arm.

His roar of pain almost deafened me and I watched him fall backward, cradling his wrist while howling with agony. I was free, and so I took off out of the room, sprinting at faster than lightning speed down the hallway, aiming for the nurses' desk at the very end of the hall. "Help! He's trying to get me!" I distinctly remember shouting at the top of my lungs. I saw faces peering out of the rooms as I whizzed by. I didn't get to see exactly what their expressions looked like, but I can only imagine they looked absolutely confused, probably frightened if we're being honest. I made it to the desk and the nurse sitting there had the most shocked expression I'd ever seen before up to then. I babbled breathlessly about how *"He"* tried to suffocate me after I told him to go away. Now, I bet you know what comes next here, right?

"H-He?" she asked, shaking.

"Yeah," I blurted, "I tried to hide from him and he tried to... To... To..." At that very instant, time stopped whizzing by. Adrenaline still had my heart going like it was an engine, but everything was slowing down again. This included my mind. Thoughts weren't screaming at me from all directions anymore, instead going dead fucking silent.

I looked around. Every resident of my particular hall, "A" hall, I believe, was outside, all looking at me like I'd just lit off a firecracker in the middle of the hallway. This Limbo lasted for just five seconds longer before the door at the other end of the hall burst open with two security guards, three nurses, and some monkey in a tux stomping down toward the nurses' desk.

"What's going on?" shouted the suit guy. No one answered him. Everyone looked blankly around at each other. All except for me, that is, who's brain instead was a crashed computer in that moment. The suit looked at the nurse and asked, "Are you alright here, Doris?" She nodded uneasily.

I looked up at the two security guards, both eyeing me with the same caution -- though of course, masked behind a layer of stoicism -- as everyone else around me. One of them, I saw, had his hand hovering over the holster on his right hip. This, though alarming to me, somehow didn't affect me at all. The guy in the suit looked at me, narrowing his eyes. "Hello there," he said to me in a tone that I obviously knew wasn't genuine, an almost shit-eating tone of voice that told me I was about to be in for it. "Are *you* alright?"

I stared at him hollowly. He may as well have been talking to a mannequin at that point. I had not the slightest thought as to what the hell I was supposed to do or say. Even if I had, though, I'm not entirely sure I would've been able to say anything anyways. Just like how, before, I *wanted* to say something, but I... I just... I don't know, I just *couldn't!*

For just a moment, I want you to imagine that you're a bug in a jar, okay? Got that? Good, now I want you to imagine that someone's shaking the absolute shit out of this jar. You wanna get out of the jar, like, *really bad*, but no matter what you do, the one and only thing your small, insignificant ass can do is sit there and *try* not to have your brains get slung out of you ear canals or something. You watch the jackass on the outside continue to shake the jar, likely laughing his or her ass off while they do, and you simply close your eyes and pray that *some day*, they might *stop* *shaking the damn jar.*

"Powerlessness" I think it's called. Well anyway, that's what that felt like to me, and it was the first time that I'd actually notice it. Well, the first time it *really* stuck out to me anyways. It'd be a long time after before I'd actually figure out why this was happening. The security guards moved in on me and gently, though firmly took me by my arms and began leading me back down the hallway. Panic took an instant hold of me, realizing they were about to take me back to my room, back to *him*. Obviously, I wanted to panic, to beg, kick and scream for them *not* to take me back, but just like how I couldn't respond to the suit's question, I couldn't do anything here, either.

*Nothing except watch them put my ass back in the jar and shake the hell out of me again.*

*God, please no! Not there, they can't!* Slowly, my mind began to resume a bit of control over my body and my feet began trying to anchor themselves into the floor. This did me no good whatsoever as the guards' grasps were both far too strong for me. To them, I must've just been a bratty kid being dragged out of the store, kicking and screaming after being told he couldn't have a candy bar.

The closer we came to the room, the harder and harder I began to struggle. I even tried heaving my chin down to bite their hands like I had with my imaginary friend earlier, but that was no good, either, with them jerking my arms forward, putting their hands out of my reach. "Please, stop!" I managed to cry out. "You can't take me back in there! You just can't! He's gonna get me if you do, please stop!"

Neither of them paid me any attention. They continued to drag me to my room. When we reached the doorway, the light was on and at the far end of the room, right where I'd seen "him" land after letting me go, was one of the male nurses with another bandaging his hand. I was confused. What the hell was going on here? Why the hell was there a nurse in my room and why was he bandaging his--

*Wait a minute...*

Like small jolts of lightning, it all suddenly started coming together for me. That wasn't my imaginary friend earlier, trying to hurt me. It was just a nurse, one who'd kept me from suffocating me to death. *But... But HE was there. I know he was...*

*Wasn't he?*

I stopped struggling then and my body went limp in the guards' arms. There was no point in fighting now, if there even was before. I shuffled sort of drunken looking into the room and climbed back into the bed. The suit guy came into the room and asked the nurse if he was okay. He took one look at me, like he was trying not to lose his cool with me, and then turned back and nodded his head at the suit.

Suit then turns to me and says, "You're quite an excited one, ain't ya, buddy?" I stared at him blankly. Truth be told, I only barely heard what he said at all.  He continued to smile at me, which was honestly creeping me out a bit, if only because I knew I was gonna be in trouble over the whole thing with the nurse and his smile was just the kind you'd see from a villain in a movie or something, to me at least. The smile that said to me, *"Yeah, you're ass is mine, boy".*

I half expected either him or the nurse, or both, to start pummeling the shit out of me or something, but they didn't. Instead, suit guy looked at the nurse again and nodded for him, the nurse bandaging his hand up, and the two security guards to all leave the room. They got up and left, leaving me alone with suit guy.

"What's your name, son?" he asked as soon as the door closed again. For a second, my mouth just hung open, unsure of what to tell him. *My name? Why does he want to know my name? Hell... What IS my name?*

That should give you at least a base understanding of where my head was at the moment. I couldn't remember my own fucking name!  It came back to me eventually and I answered, "G-Gregory." He chuckled and extended his hand out to me.

"Well Gregory, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Ratha. I'm the head of this hospital. You know what that means?" I shook my head. "That means I've been doing all of this..." he gestured around the room with his left hand, "for quite a while. See, I've treated young boys and girls just like you, Gregory, for a long time now. I've seen a lot of them come to me just like you, troubled or hurting, and I've been able to help them go back into the world, able to fit in with other kids better than ever before, and overall be happy. That's what I want, for you to be able to leave this place and be happy."

I remember shrinking down a little at this. I remember shrinking down a little at this. He seemed so calm, yet I still couldn't help but feel that it was all a ruse. Somehow, I just knew he was about to charge at me or something, primed to wring my neck dry. He remained still as stone, smiling warmly at me.

"Now Gregory," he continued, "I'd like to ask you a few questions real quick, okay?" I made no motion, nor did I say anything. He didn't wait for a response, though. "First, I wanna ask, how're you getting along here?"

My eyebrows cocked at this. "What do you mean?" I asked.

"Like with the other patients, are you getting along with them? Have any friends maybe?"

"Oh uh... Well, sure, they're nice to me. It's fun to play with them." He nodded his head at this.

"Good, good. What about the staff; the nurses and doctors, are they nice to you as well?"

"Yeah."

"Okay." He nodded and paused for about a minute or two, eyeing me up and down. "Okay now Gregory -- can I call you Greg?" I nodded and he continued, "Greg, I'd like you to tell me exactly what happened just a moment ago when you bit the nurse."

"Oh..." My head shrank all the way into my shoulders like a turtle. I was hoping he wasn't going to try this line of questioning with me, even though I knew he was going to eventually. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I wish that I could've had a decent answer for him when he did ask. "Well... I-I mean, I-I didn't mean to."

"I'm sure you didn't. I'm not trying to get you in trouble here, Greg, but instead, I'm trying to figure out what happened so we can try and keep it from happening again, you know?" Despite my suspicions from earlier, I could tell from both his face and his voice that he meant what he'd just told me. Of course, that didn't do too much to actually calm my nerves as, again, I knew trying to explain any of it to him would likely either do nothing at all to help or worse, just get me brushed off anyway.

"I just wanna help you, but I need your help to do that, okay?" To his credit, he actually had a genuinely warm expression on his face when he said this. His voice complimented this, too. This *somewhat* made the anxiety melt away. My body loosened up just a bit.

"Um... O-Okay. Well, I-I thought he was... I thought he was somebody else."

"Who?" I took a deep breath.

"I-I don't really know, sir. He's just a... Well, he's someone that keeps coming to me every night, always saying bad things to me."

"Like what?"

"Like how he wants to hurt me or my family and friends."

"Has he ever done any of it? Hurting them, I mean?" I shook my head.

"No. Not yet, I don't think."

"Has anyone else told you about him?"

"What do you mean?"

"Like has anybody else told you that they were being harassed by him?"

"No. I don't think anybody else has ever seen him."

"I see." I saw his eyes look at the floor for a second, nodding with a ponderous sort of frown on his face before looking back up at me. "Okay, and can you tell me his name?" I frowned then.

"Huh? His what?"

"His name, the person that's bullying you like this. He's got a name, right?" I opened my mouth to speak, then realized something. He *didn't* have a name. Not just that I didn't give him one, either -- again, he wasn't *just* some imaginary friend of mine, not to me anyways. He was just that, some jackass that harassed me every night that only *I* could actually see.

"I... I... I don't know, sir." His frown deepened and his lips pursed.

"Are you saying you can't remember his name or--" I cut him off, shaking my head in response.

"Nuh-uh, I'm saying he doesn't *have* a name."

"No?" he asked. I shook my head again. "Well now, that's certainly somethin', ain't it?" he said with an easygoing chuckle. I kept staring at him, cocking my eyebrows.

"I don't get it."

"Oh, nothin'. So here's what we'll do, okay? Have you ever heard the old saying "There's a lot of power in a name"?" I shook my head. "Basically it means that if you know the name of this thing, this person, you have their identity. If you have that, then there's a lot more you can do to stop them. So with that being said, I want you to figure out the name of this bully of yours. Once you've done that, come find me and we'll talk about how to solve the problem, okay?"

"Um... O-Okay, yeah. But uh, how am I s'posed to do that, sir?"

"You said he comes to you every night, right?" I nodded. "Well then, if that's true, he'll likely come back again, right?" I nodded again, this time feeling a slight shiver slithering down my back at the thought of him returning that night. "So when he does, or at least the next time you see him if not tonight, I want you to ask him his name for me. Think you can do that, buddy?"

"U-Um... Uh... I-I..." I couldn't form words. Anxiety started forming a tight noose around my throat. Even if, and we're talking about a *monster sized* IF here, it were as simple as smiling and asking the fucker his name and he'd give it to me, what then? Him returning meant he was gonna come back to finish what he'd started earlier with suffocating me.

He stood up from his chair and stepped toward the door. "Wait!" I cried, shooting my arm out to him. He stopped and turned to face me. "Wh-What if he tries to hurt me again?" His eyebrows raised at me.

"If he tries to what?" he asked.

"He tried to smother me with my blankets earlier, just before I ran out."

"I thought you said he hadn't actually hurt anyone."

"He hasn't, at least not until then."

"And you're sure it was him?" I nodded. His eyes looked to the ground, then to the door. I watched him rub his chin for a second, I guess trying to take into consideration what I'd just told him and figure out what to do or say next. Admittedly, though, I was also getting the distinct feeling he either wasn't taking me seriously or he knew something I didn't, something he apparently didn't feel like sharing with me.

"I see." he said finally. "Well then, in that case," He reached into his pocket and held out his hand. In the center of his palm was what looked to me like a joy buzzer, the kind you'd see in cartoons with the giant red button held by two straps going around your hand. I looked puzzled at it.

"You know what this is?" he asked. I shook my head. "This, my little friend, is the hotline button. If you find yourself ever needing me or one of the nurses in a pinch, just mash this big, pretty red button and we'll come running, got it?" I looked at him, examining his face. He was serious with this, at least as far as I could tell. I looked back down at the button.

"Go on, try it on." I took the button from his palm and strapped it onto my own palm. "It fit okay?"

I nodded. "Good. Just remember, if something happens, anything at all, press that button, okay? And find his name. We'll talk more afterwards, okay?" He turned and opened the door. Just before leaving, he turned back to me and switched off the light, saying, "Night night, Greg. Don't worry, noone's gonna hurt you here, I promise." He left the room then.

I was alone again, alone in the dark. I looked around the room. Quiet, empty, dark. No one was there. No one except me.

I looked at my hand. The big red button actually managed to stand out in the darkness. My finger grazed the top of it lightly. "*No one's gonna hurt you, I promise."*

"Oh, for God's sake, *please* tell me you're not actually buying that fat load of crap, are you?" His cackle rattled all throughout the room. "Jesus H. fuckin' Christ, Greggy. I knew you were a little wimp, but stupid too? For fuck's sake."

My joints locked up again. I couldn't see him anywhere, nor could I pinpoint any direction where his voice was actually coming from. It was everywhere, surrounding me. My head swung wildly in every direction. I felt my finger starting to push down on the button. I held back on it though.

*Not yet... I have to get his name.*

I took a deep breath, steeling myself as best I could, and said in a timid voice, "Who are you?"

"Oh, here we go with *this* again. *"Who are you, Who are you?"* Give me a goddamn break, will ya? Jesus, you can't even recognize someone who's known you before you were born?"

"What? I-I don't understand." I heard him bark a laugh.

"Oh, I'll bet you don't."

"Okay, well then, *where* are you, can you tell me that?"

"Oh, *now* you wanna see me?" I heard him scoff.

"Yes. I want to know who you are."

"Then I suggest you take a good look inward, Greggy-boy."

"What? What the heck's *that* supposed to mean?"

"Haven't you ever felt like a part of you was missing?"

"What?"

*"What?"* Jesus, is that all you can say?"

"Look, I don't understand, I just want to know who you are."

"And I'm telling *you*, you know who I am."

"No, I really don't."

"In that case, you may want to ask that bitch of a mother we have." There it was again, that "we" he kept using.

"We?" I asked. "You mean "Mine"?"

"I didn't stutter, ya little shit. Hopefully now you can start getting a clue, though."

"Are you telling me that you're my... My..."

"Go on, say it."

"You're my *brother*?"

"Oh you say that like it's such a bad thing." I heard him make an exaggerated gasping noise. "You don't like me as your brother?" My spine stiffened further. He chuckled again and said, "Oh well, you're not the only one."

"What?"

"And here we are again with this. *"What?"* God, I'm gonna have to start calling you *"What?"* from now on, ain't I?"

"What do you mean? I don't have a brother. I never had a--"

"Again, ask mom. I betcha she'll lose her ass once she realizes you know the truth." This next part's a little hard to explain, but I began to feel a sort of pressure just sort of peeling away from me. By this, I mean that I started to feel normal again, like I actually had control over my body and my thoughts again.

"I'll leave you alone then, as reward for finally figuring *this much* the fuck out." I heard him say with a condescending chuckle before finally feeling completely free again. I remember actually having to catch my breath afterwards, having felt constricted for so long.

I looked around the room. Dark, quiet, still. There wasn't anything or anybody in that room, only me. I sprang from the bed, flipped the lightswitch on, and frantically began tossing the room, pulling out all the drawers, turning over everything. I wanted to find him. I wanted to see him. My "Imaginary friend"...

*My brother...*

His words continued echoing in my head as I did. *I have to find him!*

*(How is he my brother?)*

*I have to find his name!*

*(How can I have a brother?)*

*It's the only way I can make him go away!*

*(Who else knows about this?)*

That's when I stopped. I didn't know his name, but I still knew *him*, to a certain degree at least. I knew who he was *claiming* to be. Now, obviously, nine year old me had every instinct that the motherfucker was lying his ass off, just another way he was succeeding in screwing with me, right? BUT...

What if it *was* true? If I did have a brother, then who else would know? Well, the answer to *that* question at least was answered almost immediately. He told me so himself, right; "That old bitch of a mother of ours." I couldn't bear anything remotely related to the idea that my mother had been *intentionally* lying to me for years, but then again, how would I know for sure unless I found out for myself, [right](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13065rx/this_was_how_i_found_out_i_had_a_brother_it_was/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)?
