My mom always said, “Never stay in a dangerous situation!”

She used to practically smother me with all her fussing and worrying, something I guess I took for granted.

After dad disappeared (or let’s face it, left) mom wasn’t the same. She spiraled, unable to cope with the loss of her other half. She disappeared into a bottle.

I became unimportant, somehow. Just a prop in the background. I moved out when I turned eighteen. 

Tonight I’m drunk, I feel a little dizzy but mostly giddy. I quit my shitty fast food job today, after exchanging a few choice words with management. 

I don’t know where my next rent check is coming from but I sure as hell feel good about my choice. I’ve worked there since I was sixteen, I’m twenty two now. I physically cannot flip another burger.

My ride ditched me an hour ago. I should never have come with her, I’ve worked with Chelsea for two years and she doesn’t exactly have the reputation of being responsible. Last I saw her I she was slinking away with some bearded dude.

Whatever. I’m too drunk to care. I step outside to breathe the fresh air.

It’s beautiful tonight. The bar is surrounded by snowy woods, illuminated by moonlight. Large snow flakes float gently to the ground. I can see my breath coming out like plumes of smoke.

Some guy who was already on the wooden deck offers me a smoke. I smile and take it. I reach in my pocket for a lighter and don’t find one, he offers his.

 I don’t initiate conversation and he doesn’t either. We smoke in silence for a while. 

“David, get over here!” David, who has just finished his cigarette, smiles at me before heading over to his friends.

I go back inside, buy one more drink. 

Even though I’m drunk I realize I should probably get a new ride. When I take out my phone I see it’s dead. *Great.* The bar doesn’t close for hours, I go see if the bar tender has a charger.

“Young lady, I don’t even have a mobile phone.” He points to a corner next to a jukebox. “There’s a landline over there I let customers use.”

It’s not till my finger is hovering over the number keys that I realize the only number I have memorized is my mom’s. 

*Worth a shot.*

After five rings she picks up, with a slurred “Hello?”

I hang up without speaking. She won’t be able to pick me up tonight.

I know it’s roughly ten miles back to town. I look around the bar, the only people left are David’s group and a few old men in a corner. It would be humiliating to ask for a ride. 

I guess I’ll start walking. Thirty minutes in my nose and ears feel like they’re gonna fall off. I swear to myself I’ll never again leave home without a hat. 

*I’m gonna murder Chelsea. Why didn’t I ask for a ride? Stupid.*

I’m looking back in the direction of the bar, considering returning when I see headlights coming down the road. I’ve still got a bit of liquid courage and the idea of a car heater is too attractive to pass up. I stick out my thumb.

The car stops, the window rolls down. “Where you headed?” The voice is deep and gruff.

“Oak Creek, just ten miles up the road. If you drop me off at a gas station I can make my way from there.” My teeth are chattering.

He gestures that I get in, I do an awkward jog around to the passenger seat. 

When I open the car door I’m hit with an overwhelming fruity aroma.

Once inside I warm my icy fingers by pressing them against the heater.

“Thanks for picking me up.”

“I don’t usually pick up hitchhikers.” He wore a baseball cap, I guessed he was around fifty. 

“Yeah, same.” I check the speedometer, he’s going exactly the speed limit. We ought to reach town in around 12 minutes or so. 

I look around the car, rubbing my hands together. He has a grapevine decoration hanging on the rear view mirror. “You like grapes?” I’m drunk and want to talk.

“I’m the god of grapes.”

I laugh at the joke, he doesn’t. I look and he isn’t smiling, he’s calmly driving with a serious expression. 

*Weird.* I’m drunk and stupid so I don’t question it. I look out the window and see the forest whizzing by. It’s not snowing anymore. 

“You know what? I love grapes. Grapes are plump.” I repeat the word. “Plump.” I like the way my lips pop at the end.

The man laughs. “Plump!” He yells. We both laugh. We chuckle. We chortle. We guffaw. Tears stream down our faces. 

I eventually calm down. *That was weird.* For some reason that had been hysterical, the funniest thing I ever heard. I had never laughed so hard in my life. *I must be really drunk.*

He’s still going exactly the speed limit. We should reach town within five minutes.

I continue the conversation. “I like wine, too.”

“Just like your mother.”

A chill runs up my spine. “What did you say?” 

He smiles.

“Stop the car, please.” He keeps driving, and fear creeps into my stomach. “Stop the car!”

“No.”

I start to hyperventilate, I take off my seatbelt. I’ll fucking jump. When I try to open the door it doesn’t work, when I try to unlock it it’s jammed. I slam my body against the door in a panic. 

“You can’t leave.” His voice was cold, amused. 

“Why the **fuck** not?!” 

“I need a new maenad.”

I stare. He’s crazy. I don’t know what he’s talking about and I don’t give a shit.

He’s about to learn something, though. 

I’m crazy too. 

I grab the wheel and yank it to the left, if I’m lucky we’ll hit a tree on his side of the car. It happens so fast, the swerve, the crash. I black out for a minute.

I wake up with my head on the dashboard, my face uncomfortably close to a jagged piece of glass. 

I check myself for injuries. I have a gash on my forehead, but other than that I appear to be fine. I can’t say the same for the man. 

He’s been thrown from the car, his limp body is at the foot of a tree. His limbs are twisted in unnatural ways. 

I leave the car from his side and slowly approach the body. His baseball cap is knocked off, splattered with blood. When I get close enough to see his face I gasp.

He has two silver horns sticking out of his damn head. 

I don’t know what to do at this point, I’m still a little drunk. I start to cry. I’m sobbing now. This escalated so quickly.

Movement interrupts my crying, its headlights coming down the road. A truck. 

I wave my arms and run in the direction of the truck, yelling for help. They stop.

The door opens and a guy rushes out. It’s David. “Are you okay? Call the police!” He yells at the guys still in the truck.

I wipe the tears off my face and try to explain through chattering teeth. “He p-picked me up and was gonna take me to town. . . He wouldn’t let me out of the car so I - I grabbed the wheel and um, yeah he’s dead. I killed him.” I point at the tree where he landed. “His body is over there.”

David looks concerned, one of his friends gets on the line with a 911 operator.

“Yeah we stopped for some chick who was screaming in the middle of the road, on the way from Charlie’s Saloon. She’s saying she killed somebody or something, and there’s been an accident. Yeah, same road.” He hangs up. “Cops are on their way.”

I barely hear him, I’m looking toward the car. The body’s gone. 

I search the trees frantically, I don’t see anything. I hear an awful noise that turns my stomach. I turn to see all three of the guys writhing on the ground, screaming. 

“What’s wrong?!” I shout to be heard over the awful sounds they’re making. “What’s wrong with you?!”

I watch, petrified as they wriggle and shriek, and start to shrink. They shrink and change until they are gray dolphins, shrieking and flopping around in the snow.

I must be dreaming. It’s the only thing that makes sense.

“Come along now.” 

I turn to see the man, perfectly fine. His hand is reached out. 

I shake my head no, my head feels foggy. 

“**Now**.”

My feet move by themselves, I walk to the man. I take his hand. 

*I don’t want to go with him.* As we stroll away from the scene I begin to giggle. 

*Three people will never go home and it’s my fault.* I belly laugh so hard my stomach hurts, tears freeze on my cheeks. 

*I don’t know if I’ll ever see my mom again.* I  cackle deliriously, my laughter echoing through the trees.
