The past few days I’ve moved through life like a zombie. I finished a handful of easy jobs well aware of what other Contract Workers whispered to each other when they assumed I wasn’t looking. August and April were busy with other tasks so I had no one willing to work with me.  

At least the jobs were mostly harmless. Dr. Fillow rewrapped my bad leg warning how it should be replaced soon. He poked around asking about my personal life. I gave him one-word answers feeling far too exhausted to get into details.  

Out of the blue, August called asking if I could go over to his place. He said he wanted to go on a short trip with me and that I should wear warm clothing. I should have refused so he wouldn’t have to deal with my bad mood. He threatened to drag me out of my bed if I didn’t come over. Since I didn’t have much of a choice, I got dressed, feeling slightly light-headed.  

He took one look at me and decided to make breakfast. I had been showering so I didn’t think I looked as bad as I felt. He forced me to sit at the kitchen table while he fried some eggs. August learned how to make some very simple dishes. He set the plate in front of me and then got started putting together some lunch. I could only have a few bites of eggs with toast before my stomach started to hurt. I rested my head on the table wanting to just roll over and die.  

“What’s gotten you so moody?” August finally asked.  

“I got dumped.” I said realizing he was the first person I told.  

He stopped working and wiped his hands on a tablecloth. He walked over behind my chair to lean down hugging my shoulders.  

“I’m sorry sweetheart.” He said sounding like a father comforting a heartbroken teenage daughter.  

I barely made an effort to shrug him away. I knew he wanted to make me feel better but it didn’t help. I felt him press his face against the side of my head making slurping sounds.  

“What are you doing?” I asked too tired to push him away.  

“Eating your brains.” He answered pausing in his efforts. “Hmm, not much in here.”  

I finally pushed him aside. He laughed at his own joke and then got a cup of coffee. He set it in front of me and got back to work on making lunches.   

“Ito is an Agent. He could die at any moment while working. He must have broken it off between you two before you got too attached.” August said as I nodded along,  

I understood that. The facts didn’t stop me from being depressed. I knew in the long run it would be better for both of us.  

“Did you have a partner that passed away?” August commented over his shoulder.  

My stomach tightened. I didn’t like talking about her or what happened. The fact I worked with someone else two years ago wasn’t hard information to find even though I rarely talked about it.  

“I heard you were injured but you took time off because of her death was hard on you. How would you react if something happened to Ito? You’re hurting now, but it was his choice to not cause more pain in the future.”  

“I’m aware of that. It's just-” I started to speak and paused to take a sip of coffee.  

No, it wasn’t coffee. I don’t know what it was. A taste I couldn’t describe hit me like a truck as I saw a swirl of strange colors. I coughed spitting out the foul liquid.   

“I don’t know how to make coffee.” August admitted with a smile that looked more like a grimace.  

He reminded me of a dog that had been caught doing something it shouldn’t. He went to dump the mug but I told him to save it and give it to The Corporation as some sort of biological weapon.   

“I realize it’ll be painful to lose him. I think it would be worth it though.” I said after I recovered.  

Whatever he put in that mug cleared my brain enough to collect my thoughts for the first time in a while.  

“You might be strong enough but is Ito? Are you going to force him into something he’s not emotionally ready for?” He pointed out.  

I leaned back in my chair feeling so stupid I didn’t consider that. With a long sigh, I scrubbed my face against my palms in frustration. August finished putting our lunches together and handed over a bag of food. He was ready to go and wanted to be done dealing with my personal life.  

“You should send him a message clearly explaining your feelings that you can handle the pain of losing him in exchange for time together. However, you need to make it clear you’ll accept the fact he may not be able to do the same. The worst thing you can do is pressure him into something he doesn’t want to make you happy. This might be Ito’s first relationship. So far, I think you two are doing just fine.”  

It felt like a fog temporarily cleared from my mind. I’d been moping around for so long it kept me from actually thinking properly.  

“You’re a good dad.” I said to him.  

We stopped by the door to get our jackets on. August paused as if I had said something wrong.  

“Speaking of which, where is Lucas?” I asked looking for a pair of small shoes near the door.  

“He’s with his relatives today.” He refused to elaborate.   

I decided to not press the matter. I’d been too focused on my own issues I hadn’t been paying attention to his. He hadn’t told me much about what was going on with him and Lucas. As far as I knew, he still had him on the weekends and had been working hard on changing that. I suddenly felt like a bad friend. Sure, August would gladly eat me if I died but at least he was willing to wait. I should really start treating him better.  

August created a doorway to a new location. It was cold but manageable. I stepped out into some light snow tightening my jacket. I didn’t bring gloves which August noticed. He pulled out a pair and helped me put them on as his dad's reflexes kicked in. I let him but flinched when my bruised fingers bent. I knew Dr. Fillow had access to magic bandages that healed faster however the broken bones recovered sooner than I expected.   

“We need to get up the side of the mountain. You’ll be too slow. I need to carry you.” He explained.  

I frowned glancing around to look for any witnesses. We were on a slight snowy slope with patches of trees. In front of us was a sparking mountain with the wind starting to pick up. He was right. I would never be able to walk up there without help.   

He got on one knee so I could climb on his back. August easily took off, running through the snow or jumping between the trees. The cool breeze felt nice on my face. This place had pure clean air that was perfect for supernatural creatures. We had only been here for a short while but August seemed to be recovering some of his internal magic source.   

As we moved, I saw glimpses of some buildings through the trees. Normally humans didn’t live in magic-rich places like this. It attracted many dangerous creatures. I couldn’t get a clear look at how many buildings there were in the distance or what kind they were.  

It only took us ten minutes to get halfway up the mountain. I found it slightly hard to breathe but it was manageable. August wasn’t wearing shoes which helped him jump between small ledges. His clawed hands jabbed into the rocks climbing as if he had done this a hundred times before.   

We entered in a narrow opening to see a small cave glowing blue with an unknown light source. So far August hadn’t told me the reason why we were here. He went over to the back wall of the cave placing a clawed hand on the smooth rock. Delicate odd symbols appeared across the rocks creating an outline of a door. He nodded and walked forward sinking into the stone.  

I followed behind unsure of what to expect. I nearly walked off a small platform. A set of spiral stairs curved along the wall so far down I couldn’t see the bottom. Along the walls were carved out holes in the rock covered with black fabric. Before I could ask what this place was, August picked me up so we could take the fastest way down.  

If I wasn’t so shocked I would have screamed. I swear we fell for a full five minutes. We slowed before hitting the ground and gently landed. August needed to hold me up because my knees refused to stop shaking. He smiled amused with himself.  

When I could walk again, he brought me over to a black-covered shape. Carefully he lifted the dusty fabric to show what was hidden away. The beauty of it took my breath away. A crystalized figure rested against a rock as if they had simply fallen asleep. They had the same claws and insect features August did. The long hair shimmered like silver spider webs. A set of four delicate dragon fly-like wings were tucked against their body. There was no internal magic source. This supernatural creature had passed away a long time ago.  

“This is my great-grandmother,” August explained.  

I looked around realizing that this place was filled with more bodies like this one. 

“I heard you’re in debt.”   

I turned my head back toward August understanding why he would ask such a question but still confused about why we came here. Bodies of powerful supernatural creatures were in high demand. Even after their internal magic gets used up, their flesh and bones can still be used in spells or formed into weapons. If August sold a pure body like this one, I could pay off my debt ten times over.  

“This is your family. You shouldn’t have even brought me here. What’s going on?”  

He didn’t show any signs of distress no matter how hard I looked.  

“I have a dangerous job. If I die, I want to have someone I can trust with all this until April is ready. But, if possible, I never want to burden her with this. His grave is only a rumor at the moment. If anyone found out it was real you can imagine how much trouble it would cause the person protecting it.”  

I looked around again understanding his point. Most people would see these bodies as raw materials. The amount of sheer power that could be produced was hard to imagine. If one person used all of this for their gain, they might be able to take over the world a hundred times over. People have killed for a fraction of this kind of magic.  

“I'm the only one who can open the door. If I die without giving someone access here, it’ll be sealed forever.”  

“Wouldn’t the right be automatically passed to April?” I wondered out loud.  

“We don’t share fathers.”   

That made sense. I hadn’t been thinking properly lately. They were half siblings but not once did he treat her any differently. Even though this grave belonged to his species he loved his little sister so much he didn’t want to burden her with it.   

“Are you sure you trust me? I mean, I could turn around and sell even ten of your dead family members and solve all my problems.” I gestured around us.  

“What do you think would happen if The Corporation got a hold of even half of these bodies?” He pressed.  

I stopped to think for a moment. It didn’t take very long to figure out how terrible of an outcome that would be.  

“They might be able to completely control a few worlds worth of supernatural creatures. I don’t know how I feel about that. I hate how often Agents die to protect humans. If they had this power, I know they would start killing off creatures that need to feed on humans to live. People like you would be slaughtered. They have always said they simply want to protect the balance between creatures and humans. But I feel like they love humans too much. It’s... complicated. I don’t have the answers. I wouldn’t be comfortable giving anyone access to any of this. Even with good intentions, it would just lead to problems.”  

I’ve seen both sides suffer. People much smarter than myself had thought their entire lives about how monsters and humans could live together. From my experience, letting one side have power over the other did not solve anything.   

“Have you talked to April about all of this? Wouldn’t she be upset that you gave this responsibility to me?” I asked him wondering her opinion on all of this.  

“She’s always known about the graves but she doesn’t fully understand how much potential is sealed away here. I asked her what she would do with one body of a crystalized relative and...” He trailed off for a second as if reliving a traumatic event. “April said she would eat it, get really big, and stomp through a city like Godzilla.”  

Yeah, she couldn’t be trusted with this. I held out my hand showing him I was ready to accept the heavy burden of keeping this grave hidden. The process was simple. He cut part of his palm then let the blood flow into my cupped hands. It fell into my skin leaving no traces behind.   

It was a bit strange that August took me here out of the blue. There was something about him that felt a little bit off but I couldn’t figure out why. This was similar to a friend suddenly making a will. Of course, I would think something might be wrong.   

Since we were done, I needed to climb back onto his back so he could quickly get us up to the door. August was skilled at climbing even with the extra weight. Since I’d spent time with him on jobs he wasn’t suited for, I didn’t realize just how strong he could be.   

We still needed to get back down the mountain after leaving the tomb. The fastest way would be to create a door. August didn’t mention any other reason why he wanted to come here so I assumed he would head back home. Instead, he took a running start jumping off the side of the ledge to get down the mountain the second fastest way.   

My stomach lifted into my throat as we started to free fall. For a second before the fear took over, I was able to take in the beauty of the area. The sparkling snow-covered slope dotted with trees made me realize why his family members wanted to fight to stay here.  

Even sturdy supernatural creatures would have been harmed falling from such a height. August knew what he was doing. He used his power to slow our fall before we hit the ground in such a gentle way, that I didn’t even notice the decrease in speed until we safely landed. It was a very impressive display of control that most people would not have been able to do. I still felt sick from the fall and once his feet touched the ground I climbed off his back and fell backwards into the snow. Our lunch bag landed next to me. I reached for it but gave up laying with my arms sprawled out and eyes closed embracing the cold on my back.  

I did think I was going to die when he jumped. My stomach had yet to settle but for some odd reason, I felt more relaxed than I had for weeks. The pain in my bad leg felt so faint it might as well not be there.  

“Richie, are you alright?” August asked in a heavy tone.  

I didn’t open my eyes and just nodded.  

“I don’t do well with heights.” I admitted.   

“That’s not what I meant.” He responded.  

Glancing up at him I thought back to everything that had happened recently. It felt like I’d been rotting from the inside and just did my best to ignore it. Any time something happened I risked falling apart. I realized that I’ve felt like this since I lost my partner. I tried to pretend as if I was fine and attempted at a normal life. When that didn’t work out, I went back to contract work that put me in danger. Broken bones, near-death experiences, and being scared to death felt right. If the person I cared about the most died because I was weak, why should I have a comfortable life?  

Was I alright?  

No. I’ve been working towards a slow suicide since I lost her.   

“Yeah, I’m fine.” I lied. “What about you? It feels like something is going on you’re not telling me about.”  

I sat up and brushed the snow from my jacket. It warmed up a little since we got here. Still, I would kill for a hot coffee at that moment.  

“Do you want to see the tree I was born under? We landed nearby.” He said refusing to answer my question.  

Without waiting he started walking through the trees heading towards a large pine standing near a clearing. He stopped in front of it to pat the bark. He looked like a person who just found an old childhood toy.  

“It’s a nice-looking tree. Can we get back to my question?” I pressed after I caught up with him.  

“My species lays an egg under the ground. When I hatched, I had to dig up through the roots. I didn’t even have a human body for the first ten years.” He said then paused for a moment almost deep in thought. “Richmond, I could tell you what has been bothering me however you wouldn’t understand it. I’m not the same as you.” 

We stood a few feet from each other a cold wind blowing between us. He was right. I would never fully understand what pain he’s gone through. I’m human. He’s not. Our lives are very different. But I could still support him if he was going through a hard time. Right now, he was acting like an older brother. He wanted to act like a bad guy to create distance between us so he wouldn’t burden me with his issues. I didn’t fully open up to him so how could I be upset he refused so as well?  

“Is this about Lucas?” I asked carefully well aware that if I said the wrong thing at that moment, I would break our friendship.  

I thought he would just doge any topics he didn’t want to address. When his hands turned into claws and August darted forward ready to rip apart flesh I was too stunned to react. Warm blood splashed against my back after the attack. Slowly I turned around to see a body bleeding out on the ground.  

More figures appeared in the trees. I was confused about how they got so close. I should have sensed a supernatural threat sooner. They all looked somewhat normal. They were dressed in warm clothing with heavy gloved and reflective goggles while others simply wore sweaters. Any exposed skin was red from the cold and some looked to hand frostbite starting at their fingertips. Each held a weapon that looked like just random objects they found. Some with knives others with large sticks. They weren’t a threat to August but I would have trouble with these numbers.  

The crowd moved in a zombified state and yet I couldn’t see any traces of a spell controlling them. This was odd. I didn’t understand what was going on. Another person darted forward in a weak attack. I easily stepped aside and then watched in horror when August swiftly sliced through the woman’s neck. On reflex I caught her trying to help but she was dead within seconds.  

“August! They’re human, stop!” I told him frantic.  

We needed to think things through before acting. He was bound by a collar. If he killed humans without a good reason, The Corporation would punish him.   

“Two days ago, all the humans at the ski lodge nearby disappeared. They assumed April or I were involved with whoever caused the trouble as revenge for our home being taken away.”  August explained but refused to look in my direction. “Richmond, leave. I’ll take care of things here.”  

I carefully placed the body of the poor woman we were unable to save on the ground. Her blood had seeped into my clothing and the cold air already started to freeze it.   

“If I do that, they won’t listen to anything I say. I know you’re not working with the person behind all this. If you live through confronting the one who did this then you’ll be killed by The Corporation.” I sternly said.   

He moved again far too quickly to stop. Another slash of his claws came down killing an easy target. Fresh blood dripped from his fingers with his back facing me.   

“That’s the plan.” His voice was steady and it chilled me more than the wind.  

“Like hell to that! You need to stay alive for Lucas!” I scolded him as if he was a child.   

I was so focused on him I didn’t notice someone heading my way with a knife in hand. August did. He lashed out taking them down but didn’t stop there. I was unable to stop him from killing three more people. He paused to take a deep breath his emotions finally breaking.  

“Lucas won’t be coming back home. He’s human. I’m not. They decided his biological family would raise him.” He sounded so defeated at that moment.  

No wonder he’d given up. He couldn’t handle losing his family again. He assumed April hated him because he didn’t fight for their home. He knew she would be fine without him and decided to die letting people assume it was for revenge.   

Sure, I had somewhat been acting the same way as him recently but I refused to leave him to die here.   

“Come on. I’m taking you home.” I told him only to be ignored.  

He refused to listen, to just stay still. He simply kept digging his graves by killing others. I went to him, grabbing a hold of his arm and using all my strength to try to make him stop. He spun around, slamming his hand hard against a tree. We stood facing each other, specks of blood across his face half hidden by his wavy hair. 

“Look at me.” He demanded. “I’m a monster. Accept that.”  

I had a bad habit of turning a blind eye to difficult things to make my life easier. I knew August wasn’t human. I didn’t know if I accepted what that truly meant or didn’t acknowledge his faults so we could become friends.   

“Humans and monsters should not interact no matter how much we love each other. It only caused pain. Isn’t that the reason why Ito dumped you?”  

He was trying to be cruel so I would leave. The words still hurt. 

“Are you just going to give up? Once you do there’s no turning back. I’m sure we’ll figure something out.” I’ll admit, my words sounded weak.  

A scowl came to his face as he started to snap.   

“Oh, why didn’t I think of that? I’ll just try harder then!” He hissed and turned to take his anger out on the half-frozen targets.  

It was sickening to watch him rip people to pieces unable to do anything about it. Pent-up anger came out with sloppy attacks. His human mask becomes more monstrous with each passing second.  

“I’ve already worked so damn hard and nothing I do matters! Humans take away everything I care about and yet I still care about them! I can’t have a family because I’m not like what I love no matter what I do! I can’t change what I am, it’s so damn frustrating!”  

He paused to try and calm down, his chest heaving with heavy breaths. August gritted his teeth holding down more rage that threatened to boil over. We both knew he was the best person to raise Lucas. But the higher-ups didn’t see that. They only saw a monster around a defenseless human child and assumed his biological family would be better. They were the people who didn’t look for Lucas when he went missing. They didn’t care what happened to his parents. They only wanted him after they found out how much money he came with. August found the boy. He was Lucas’ father the moment they saw each other. 

I looked away from him trying to think of what I could do. August would be in deep trouble if anyone found out he slaughtered humans he could have easily run from. Should I lie and say I was the one who killed them? And then what? How could we get his son back after we deal with the issue at hand. My chest hurt seeing the gore on the ground he created. Then, something caught my eye forcing me to focus on a cracked-open skull.  

There was a glitter of magic. A small thread inside. It took some effort but I saw more of those threads woven inside the heads of all the people around us. That was how they were being controlled. They may be alive but the threads had made them brain-dead puppets. Killing them had been a mercy. Did August already know that? A skilled supernatural doctor would notice the threads if they knew to look. So, August was in the clear.  

“I don’t have the answers for you. But I’m not leaving you to die. Mostly because it might be too late now.” I told August as I tensed up waiting for the next threat to arrive.  

Unlike the human puppets around us, I sensed the new person heading our way. His power looked and felt the same as the magic that ran through the mountain. Even at a distance, I knew this threat was strong. Much stronger than August. He was on his home turf but he hadn’t had much time to recover since we arrived here.  

“You humans always cause so much trouble.” August muttered almost to himself and turned toward the newcomer. “Don’t you agree, June?”  

A person walked through the trees stopping to admire the scene. He was tall and thin wearing ripped bloody clothing he’d stolen from a previous victim. The left side of his face had been completely scarred over. His long wavy dark hair reached down to his waist swaying in the cool breeze. His skin appeared stretched over an oddly shaped skeletal structure aside from his left arm. It was completely transformed into a shiny black clawed hand with joints similar to a doll.   

Clearly, he had been a survivor of the attack that wiped out his entire village. He waited until he was strong enough to take back the mountain but also to lure in August. I doubted June would be on friendly terms with his surviving family members after they sided with humans.  

“You were kind to me when we were younger, I won’t kill you right away. I’ll give you a few moments with your little vermin.” June said his voice was deep and damaged.  

I stood firm getting ready for what we would need to deal with. Glancing between June and August I knew we were in a bit of trouble. The best course of action was to run and get help if that was even possible.  

“Your internal magic is low. His isn’t. From the looks of things, he has three times as much magic as you.” I explained as if August didn’t already know all that.  

I shuffled closer to him watching June expecting him to attack at any moment.   

“You have good senses. It might help us out. I’ll create a door, hold him off and you can open the connection to get away when you see an opening.”  

We were nearly touching shoulders. I carefully looked around trying not to be noticed. At some point, June had taken control of the magic flowing through the ground and trees around us. That sucked. It blocked us off from creating a doorway out.  

“He’s blocked us. No doors, we’re stuck.” I whispered trying not to be overheard.  

“How do you know that?” August raised an eyebrow.  

“I can see it.” I answered and a longer silence came between us than I expected.  

August stared at me as if I was crazy. Couldn’t all supernatural creatures see magic? It suddenly dawned on me that my eyesight was better than most. If every creature could see exactly what they were dealing with and how much power each other held the world would be much different. Sure, I realized I had a useful skill but clearly seeing what kind of threat we faced didn’t solve our problem. The monster in front of us was still going to rip us apart. He only hadn’t just to amuse himself.  

“Are you two finished chatting?”   

June’s voice made us tense up. We did not have a plan. I’ve lived through bigger threats before. Maybe I would figure something out in the next few seconds.  

Cracks appeared in Jun’s flesh. His chest puffed out as cracking sounds echoed around it. His body started to become deformed. With an awful ripping sound, the flesh covering his ribcage split open revealing a large vertical mouth with dripping teeth. He kept pulling power out of the ground. Small glittering cracks formed across his face. He grew larger hunching over appearing more like a beast than a human.   

The foul magic coming off of him made my stomach churn. Simply being nearby made my legs tremble. Pure hatred fueled him so intensely that I didn’t know how he was keeping his deformed body together. 

 Again, I looked around for anything useful. I doubted the small knives and sharp sticks the human puppets brought along would do anything. My eyes landed on a woman with her throat slit and deep red blood staining her light brown hair. My vision started to go grey at the edges. For a moment I saw my dead partner’s face and I nearly lost myself in that terrible memory.  

This situation felt like the same one back then. Utterly hopeless facing a monster we had no chance against. By some miracle, I lived. She didn’t. I saw her lifeless body but it was never found, most likely consumed by the creature who attacked us.   

While I was distracted June attacked. Before I could even blink, he was in front of me his large clawed hand curled into a powerful blow. I raised my right arm grabbing whatever magic I could from the ground to soften the blow. I was knocked back a few feet, the bones in my arm shattering. August appeared to move in slow motion compared to the monster before us.  

He dodged an attack that would have ripped out his throat but was stuck three times in the stomach and chest so hard blood came from his mouth. He was knocked back landing hard on the ground next to me.   

No matter how hard I tried to think of a plan the horrible truth became crystal clear.   

We were fucked.
