I’m sorry to admit I was foolish enough to enter the warehouse. I am safe now, I think, but what I experienced there; the things I saw… I was not ready for it. A part of me, a proportionate chunk of my life, died there. It was sliced off, stomped on, and set ablaze by the abhorrent practices exercised in that warehouse and those who partook in them. I am not very religious, but I found myself praying after that experience. Only I, God, and the few who survived can truly know what happened there. It’s taking a lot out of me just to remember what I went through. I will do my best to explain what I saw. Hopefully this is a message to those who may fall for a queen's trap.

I didn’t know what to expect when I approached that decrepit urban monolith. Its monstrous exterior loomed over me as I cautiously walked toward the front door. I felt something wrong as I grew closer. Not necessarily danger, but a weariness that I wasn’t allowed there. I peered up and passed the building into the grey sky. Paneless windows loomed overhead and stared right back, as if they were sizing me up. I pounded on the thick metal door, its rusty cracked surface echoing thuds and shaking off grime with each knock.  Despite witnessing Cindy and her friends enter the building, I was debating whether there were truly people in there until the door opened. An impressively muscle toned man appeared in the threshold.

“Get in.” he ordered.

I did as I was told, stumbling into the small and dimly lit lobby room. It was just as grim inside as outside. Grey paint was peeling off the walls revealing old, rotted wood. I thought I was going to leave here with lung issues due to the exposed asbestos. The toned man shut the door and stood behind me. Another man, skinny and disheveled, sat behind a desk facing me. Both of these men wore a red jeweled necklace. It was quiet for a moment and I could hear the sound of creaking wood all around.

“No gem.” The disheveled man said after briefly glancing in my direction.

Deep stomping erupted behind me as I felt the muscular man march toward me.

“I lost it!” I said abruptly.

It was the first thing that came to mind. It felt like a man with a rubber mallet was attempting to burst out my chest. I heard the guard behind stop just inches away. Felt his warm breath on the back of my neck. He leaned forward, curving his neck around mine, and inhaled through his nostrils with unsettling ferocity. I flinched a little, but his hands on my shoulders held me in place. Something shiny worked its way into my peripheral vision. He was holding a dagger to my throat. His powerful exhale dissipated as he straightened himself back to normal.

“Smells good.” He pronounced.

“Smell is good.” The disheveled man echoed back, returning back to paperwork of some sort as he pressed a button under his desk.

A jolting buzz sounded in the room and a nearby double door swung open to an even dimmer room. I assumed by now this was obviously some cartel shit. Maybe Cindy had gotten herself into human trafficking of some sort, due to the blood she had taken from me. Maybe it was some illegally funded research center that remained in the shadows. These were still incomparable to what was actually going on. I should’ve contemplated how absolutely fucking weird this all was, but I was under the spell of underailable tunnelvision.

“Where’s Cindy?”

“Cindy? Who told you their name was Cindy? The disheveled man said, still refusing to look at me.

“There are no names here. You’re worker or affectionate. Still compensated all the same.” The muscular man behind me added.

Worker or affectionate? No names? These people talked to me as if they expected I knew what they meant. I tried my best to pretend I belonged and walked casually through the double doors. They immediately closed behind me. I couldn’t tell where the room ended. It was huge, and the darkness that besieged the few dozen tungsten bulbs which hung far overhead disguised the room's true size.

And then I heard what I had first chalked up to noises that the old building made. The shifting wood was much clearer now and carried through the vast room with relenting reverberation. It now sounded like a crunch, then a squelch, then a crunch, then a squelch. Crunch squelch crunch squelch. It was all around me. I couldn’t see what was making the noise. I didn’t want to find out, but I had to find her.

“Hello?.. Cindy?” I beckoned into the darkness.

Only the mysterious repetitive sounds answered back.

Murky air and dust particles swam past my outstretched palms as I cautiously waltzed into oblivion. Something cold then hit my hand, or rather I ran into it. It felt like a flat cement wall. I decided to move along its perimeter. As my eyes slowly adjusted I realized the wall was curved, forming a cylinder in the middle of the giant room. I kept going until my hand slipped past the wall. I had found an entrance within the cylinder. Past it, the noises were much louder and clearer. And so was that copper metal smell.

There were several people, barely hidden in the darkness, sitting in a circle. They were all hunched over something in the middle. Their arms reached ravenously to grab from it. I drew closer. 

“Hello?” I asked but they ignored me as if I wasn’t there.

Whatever was in the center formed a pile. I watched their arms travel from the pile and towards their mouths as they chewed it. It snapped and squished between their teeth. I had found the source of the sound. The closest one turned to face me. What looked like red jelly dangled from his mouth. He held more in his hand, extending it toward me while chewing. It smelled awful. As the man’s hand grew closer to me the metallic smell that wafted throughout the warehouse was intensely amplified. There was something rotten yet sweet about it. And oddly enough it smelt familiar. I waved my hand and recoiled away. He shoved what remained within his palm into his mouth like a toddler eating spaghetti, returning back to the pile before him as if he forgot about my presence.

I left their little cylinder and continued my aimless search. The darkness retreated slightly as my eyes had taken the time to adjust. The floor of this warehouse held scattered metal scrap. Broken glass and dead flora lay dormant in still water that permeated through cracks in the pavement. I was lucky to have accidentally dodged the shrapnel and holes that laid about.

The ambient chewing noises grew quieter as I searched. Eventually, I found a set of stairs that seemed miles away from anything of interest. The stairs heading up were blocked by structural collapse. The only path left was down, so I went deeper. Heading down the stairs, the haunting pungency returned with each step. I suddenly heard footsteps above me. Rubber on cement echoed through the stairwell. I froze up and lied flat against the wall, afraid to head deeper yet mortified to approach whatever was making those footsteps. The figure revealed itself. A young woman swiftly turned the corner and descended past me. She carried a bag similar to the one Cindy stored my blood in. She paid me no mind as she rounded through the threshold and entered floor B2. 

At least this floor had adequate lighting. I found the woman in a smaller room that held industrial freezers. They looked new and out of place among the grime of the warehouse. I watched the woman open the metal doors and empty the contents of her bag. Vials filled with blood were stacked onto others previously stored there. She closed the door and strutted past me again toward the stairwell. A hilt protruding from a sheathe bounced on her hip as she turned the corner.

Across from the stairwell were large double doors that looked like they were removed from a holding cell and installed right in this basement floor. They were locked. I couldn’t see through the foggy windows. I pressed my ear up to the glass. I heard a conversation amongst a constant sound similar to a calm waterfall. I tried listening the best I could, but I only made out a string of a few words.
“The bloom’s been scarce recently.”
All of a sudden I heard multiple voices yelling from behind me.

“You agreed to this!” I remember hearing before turning around.

Two WWE sized men were hauling a scrawny guy in a polo shirt and khakis through the freezer room and toward the double doors. 

“Parsons, you’re almost done. Fuckin’ stop it.” One of them said to the guy they were carrying.


Parsons squirmed as the door was unlocked with a keycard one of the men had. They carried him through and down a hallway. I was able to slither behind the doors before they fully shut. I noticed the men had daggers of their as I followed them casually down the hall. It struck me as weird that they used that guy's name. I was told earlier nobody had names down here, but Parsons did. Parsons squealed as he was carried off through a busy corridor. His pleads disappeared into the hallway.

I was alone now, but I did hear distant voices and sloshing liquid echoing around near the end of the hallway. There were definitely more than a few dozen people already down here. Screaming erupted from behind the door that man was dragged through. But he wasn’t my goal right now. Once I got out of here, maybe I could save him, too. From what it sounded like, though, he agreed to this in some way.

I continued on until I reached the end of the hall which opened into a much larger space. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was about to experience probably the most grotesque and utterly sacreligious place this Earth had to offer. If I had the choice now I would’ve turned back. I would’ve never visited that warehouse to search for Cindy. I did find her. In this very room which housed unbearable profanities toward all the senses a human has in their arsenal.

People scattered around the room, standing over hexagonal containers stacked on the floor the size of kiddie pools. They were pouring the vials of blood into these pools en masse and stirring them with long sticks that contained a bulb-like wooden sphere at their ends. Steam arised from these containers and filled the room with a harsh scent of sweet rust. It looked like a factory operation. Except, once I had the chance to view these containers up close, I realized I had missed an important detail. The walls of these hexagonal containers weren’t flat like steel could be molded into, its exterior surface was uneven and bumpy. Its corners weren’t sharp and defined, but angled unevenly. Forms were poking out from the walls, little outstretched branches it looked like. I bent down for a closer look. They were fingers, feet, knees, faces.

The walls were stacked human bodies bound together by some type of wax material. Feet and elbows bent at unnatural angles, stomachs jutted forward, faces with mouths open agape and eyes shriveled like white raisins all bound together to house a deep red liquid. A chaotic orchestra of the human form haphazardly geometrized. None of these souls moved. Trapped forever in these awkward positions. An uncomfortable tingling sensation shot through me. I felt paralyzed. Nobody should ever have to see this. A soul substituted for structural materials. A life equivalent to concrete. And when I looked up I saw her.

Cindy submerged in the pool of blood in which the bodies contained. Only her head stood above water, resting against the walls. She remained still but focused, staring intensely at the ceiling. Her eyes darted at me.

“You’ve found me.” She said with a melodic tone.

Her stabbing stare shook me down to my spine. I felt exposed like a lamb surrounded by wolves. Yet, nobody paid me any mind. Those stirring the pools continued to stir. And Cindy continued to stare. The liquid she laid in began shifting. Not like water, but like gelatin, and several figures stood from its depths. The gelatinous blood plummeted from their naked bodies back into the pool as they vaulted over the corpses and wandered off in different directions. Cindy laughed with delight.

“You just missed it, my little tulip.” She exhaled.

I tried my best to ignore the absurdity. To act like none of this shit was happening. People didn’t do things like this. My girlfriend surely wouldn’t. That wasn’t the Cindy I had known. I tried to focus my mind on her, the Cindy I knew, evicting any conscious thought of the chaos around me as I attempted to grab her from the pool.

“We are leaving right now.” I tried to say with conviction, but the words came out as a monotone weep.

I reached for her shoulder.

“Who are you to touch me!?” She barked. 

The sound of wood bouncing from the floor scattered around us.

“Cindy, please. I’m trying to help you!”

Those who stood over the pools stirring now gathered their attention toward us, slowly approaching.

“How ungrateful are you in your position, to be picked among the flowers and cherished by us; to even think of coming here!” She flinched away.

She seemed insane, like she was stuck in a grand delusion. Her tone now was unlike anything I had seen before. It just made me angry at this point. In my mind I had blocked out the corpses, the blood, those who partook in this operation that now circled me like vultures. If I acknowledged it was real then I would die right there, otherwise there’s no explanation. It was all an unfathomably bad dream I could yank Cindy and myself from. So I lunged toward her, reaching for her arm again. But she stood quickly, and I fell into the bloody depths.

On impact with the liquid's surface, some of it made its way into my mouth and nose. It choked and burned my throat. Warmth fully surrounded me as I whipped my arms and legs sporadically, attempting to grab onto something, anything to pull myself up. A calming sensation suddenly possessed me. The warmth felt pleasing, like dopamine for the skin. The gelatin that found its way in my mouth had melted like milk chocolate on my tongue. The burning in my throat and on my taste buds settled and became a delightful sensation. I wanted to be here forever. I didn’t care if I ever came back up for air. I didn’t need air anymore. It was pure, untainted nirvana. Until a shock of pain on my scalp disturbed it. 

I was hoisted above the surface by the hair. It was Joan. She grasped onto my hair and stared at me wildly. Another instant zap of pain below my right shoulder. I looked down at her dagger buried deep beneath my flesh. She pulled it out slowly. I was about to scream, I expected myself to, but the pain was overshadowed by the euphoria. Then Joan placed the dagger beneath her own throat and pushed. She dropped instantly, and so did her hold on my scalp. I did scream, then.

The euphoria diminished and the nightmare had rushed back into my reality. I watched the other members of this operation rush to Joans limp body, leaking blood like a damaged hose. Some of them tried tending to her, but the majority were wiping the blood off the floor with anything they could find. Mostly their own shirts. I pushed my legs through the dense liquid towards the edge of the pool and toppled over onto the floor. Stiff fingernails, teeth, and bone ripped at my skin and clothes before I landed with a wet thud. As I gathered myself off the floor, I watched one of the men who were in the pool with Cindy hand her a towel and escort her down the hall.

“He tainted it!” Someone yelled.
“It’s ruined!” - “Fucking idiot!” - “It was almost done!” Erupted from among the crowd.

They were all directed at me. I stood there, shaking, covered head to toe in red goop. I remember at that moment a thought had manifested in my mind very clearly.

‘I fucked up.’

My thoughts were confirmed when, in eerie unison, the crowd walked toward me. They drew their daggers as they grew closer. I did the only thing I could. I ran. My shoes squelched with each heavy step. I tried my best to avoid the corpse containers, but they snagged on my jeans and dug into my skin. Daggers swung within my peripheral vision, knicking my torso and arms. Someone got me right in the thigh. It hurt like hell. My muscle gave out and I fell, landing on my already wounded shoulder. I watched as the perpetrator dropped their dagger and fell to their knees gurgling an eruption of blood. The crowd was caught behind his flailing body as I crawled with my good arm and leg. I forced myself to stand and limped on toward the hallway before the entangled crowd could get me.

The doors to the freezer room were just within my reach. I felt the cold steel of the door handle in my palm and yanked it downward. It didn’t budge. I tried again and again wiggling it with all my strength. It was locked. In a fruitless and desperate attempt I smashed my hand on the windows and yelled for someone to let me out. It was stupid, but I was really damn desperate to just get above ground. I knew I was trapped there, so I ran, or limped frantically, back down the hall.

The end of the hall was not an option for me, so I searched for the only room I knew that possessed someone who might be able to help. I found Parson’s strapped to a bed naked. His crotch was bleeding profusely. He looked pale and ill. His eyes were locked onto mine, but he didn’t bother to speak. Even though I didn’t know him, seeing him like that was the tipping point for me. I threw up red chunks all over the floor. I recouped fast, shutting the door and barricading it with a tipped stainless steel cabinet as vomit still dribbled from my lips. Immediately, I went to work on freeing Parsons. He whispered as I unbuckled the straps around his wrists.

“I don’t want to be a worker. I don’t want to be a worker, please change it, I don’t want to.”
He continued to plead as slamming and muffled threats came from behind the door. This prompted Parson’s to yell even more.

“My shoes my shoes my shoes!”

I covered his mouth and told him to shut up. I was already feeling weak physically and mentally. It was impossible to tell whether the blood that ran down my chest and behind my leg was mine or from the pool. I wanted to lie down on the floor and fall asleep. But then the commotion stopped, and I heard her voice.

“My little tulip, please come out. You’re making a mess.”

I was done with Cindy. Her voice provoked nothing but hurtful memories now. I remained silent. Parson stared at me frantically like an indoor cat let outside for the first time. Or, I guess, like a freshly castrated man about to be stabbed to death by a mob. Either way I don’t think he could fathom exactly what was happening. His eyes were bloodshot and wild. The slamming continued again. It was much stronger this time.

“Give me my shoes my shoes my shoes!” Parsons repeated.

The cabinet slid forward an inch with every smack of the door. I searched lazily under tables, behind bins, in cabinets for a pair of shoes. Dust plumed around the hinges as screws loosened from the wall. Bam… Bam… Bam…  I found them in an overhead cabinet along with some other clothes and tossed them to Parsons. The door fell crooked and toppled over the cabinet. The guard from the lobby room stood among the flurried fog of dust and debris. I felt defeated. What could I have done? There was no more running, no more fighting. The gelatine had thickened around my body making it even harder to move amongst the ongoing crippling pain. My body and mind were in agony.

A shrieking whistle filled my ears. The cloud of debris parted in a circle around the guard as he tumbled down onto the door, his mouth opened in surprise although I couldn’t hear what was coming out of it. I looked over to Parsons. He propped himself up on the table, arm extended with a compact pistol gripped in his hand. The room was suddenly flooded by the crowd. Parsons instantly disappeared under their mass. Gunshots went off under the hoard of bodies. I crawled toward the entrance as footsteps trampled over me. Feet, knees, and elbows plunged into my already torn figure. I felt a rib snap under the pressure. I crawled over the body of the fallen guard, searching his pockets for the keycard he used to unlock the door. I found it, slid it from his pocket, and continued crawling into the halls until I had room to stand and limp along the wall. The pain and fatigue was so intense that every step I took was conscious and precise. One more sudden burst of pain and I was likely going to pass out. I reached the door and scrambled to wave the keycard over its sensor. The shouting grew louder behind me. I heard her voice amongst them.

“Wait, please don’t leave me!”

I ignored her and entered the freezer room. Tables and chairs flung around as I made my way to the stairwell. In my rushed and barely conscious state I assumed I was doing a good job forming obstacles, but I probably just looked like a toddler knocking furniture around in a tantrum. As I rounded up the stairs I could see the security doors open again. I leapt up the stairs aggressively, knowing that if I fell it would be over for me. I didn’t have any other options. 

I continued hobbling up each step three at a time. I could hear rapid footsteps below me now. When I reached the entryway to the main floor I continued past it up to the rubble. There lay large fragments of concrete on the steps, roughly half my own height I could hide behind. I tried to hoist myself over them but I had forgotten about my shredded chest muscle. Instead, I slid over it and dropped on the stairs. Frantic footsteps grew louder. They were getting close. I rested against the rubble. The concrete slowly shifted, giving at the pace of molasses. To my surprise, and to my fears, the rubble gave free.

It tumbled down the stairs spinning rapidly, catching anyone in its path. I didn’t get a good look at it on the way down, but I heard it. Stiff cracks and blunt groans. And then a heavy slam led by wails of pain as it rested at the bottom of the steps. I surveyed the aftermath from the top of the stairs. Arms and legs, either limp or slowly grasping for nothing, poked out from under the fragments like a tortoise with too many limbs. Someone whose head remained the only part of her body free coughed up blood aggressively. Next to her was Cindy.
A strong urge overcame me to help her out. Yes, I realized she was insane, but she was in pain. You can’t just forget a person that quick no matter how much you tell yourself you should. Her leg was trapped under the concrete and a few other bodies. I watched her sit up paralyzed, too stunned to understand what happened. Whether it was from seeing so many of her workers and affectionates mutilated and dead, or from her own injuries, I don’t know. She just sat there like a doll until those men that accompanied her in the pool lifted her arms and pulled her out.

A trail of blood followed across the floor. Her left leg was severed at the hip and her right leg was all bent up like a child had chewed on a plastic straw. A wave of more people ascended the stairs and tackled the men helping her. They stabbed them repeatedly, and again, stabbed themselves. Those uninjured lifted Cindy above their heads and traversed across the rubble, up the stairs, and into the vast room of darkness, ignoring me entirely. I waited for the last to leave before setting foot outside the stairwell. I could have just left. That would have been the smart thing to do. Everyone was distracted and too busy to deal with me. But I didn’t. If Cindy was dying I had to be there for her. So I followed them. 

I found myself amongst the crowd who now circled around Cindy. We were in what looked like a quickly thrown together hospital room that accompanied the space in the corner of the warehouse. I thought to myself that she would survive this. Someone here was a doctor that could sew her back up and stop the blood loss. Cindy began groaning and physically convulsing. Nobody came to her aid. Everyone stood still. Watching. Her hips and torso jolted up and down atop the stained covers of the operation table. Clutching the table, groaning in pain, deep rhythmic breaths. Her stomach began moving. 

The crowd gasped with excitement. Gossip-like whispers were shared among them. Cindy’s groans evolved into howls as she convulsed faster and faster. I couldn’t take it. I shoved my way through the crowd, which exchanged looks of annoyance at me as they returned to their casual conversations. She looked at me with tearfilled eyes and whimpered as I cradled her in my arms. There was nothing left for me to say. I just did my best to comfort her in her final moments. And so I stood there, holding the woman who I loved as she bled and squirmed. Then she stopped, tilting her head to look toward her feet.

A wave of blood poured from her stomach as something revealed itself from deep within Cindy’s flesh. The crowd piled in, observing closely at her torso from just a few feet away. They climbed over each other to get a good look. Tears fell down some of their eyes as their hands clasped together in excitement. Then one of them reached down toward her stomach and lifted what had ripped its way through guts and flesh. Cindy didn’t get to witness her child's birth. Her head went limp in my arms just moments before the baby's removal. It was an infant. A newborn. My daughter. I stood there in awe. The baby was so small and her healthy lungs wailed for her mother. But the woman who removed her from Cindy’s womb carried her away. The crowd followed her, mesmerized by my child. They disappeared as they descended down the stairs. I was alone with Cindy’s corpse. It tore me up to see her like this. I lifted myself onto the table next to her and held her head in my arms once more. I cried myself to sleep.

I woke up the next morning in a hospital bed. Thoughts immediately raced through my mind: where's Cindy? Where’s my daughter? Are they okay? Police were already there waiting for me to answer their questions. They asked about Parsons who was working undercover in the cult's activities. They had pictures of me in my apartment with Cindy, in the diner with Cindy’s leading members, and outside the warehouse. They had originally pinned me as a co-leader for the organisation, but after further questioning over the course of multiple days, I had the feeling they changed their minds. I had asked about my child, to which they replied that no children were found amongst the bodies in the warehouse. The members of the cult left before the SWAT teams had arrived; roughly a day after what had transpired. They agreed to help me look for my child as long as I assisted in the remaining members' whereabouts. They keep a close eye on me, even now they lurk around this shitty motel room I’m forced to stay at for the next few nights. I don’t even think I’m allowed to post this due to the ongoing investigation. I don’t care anymore. They can take it down if they want.

The Cindy I knew was gone. Maybe she never existed in the first place. If that’s true then my life for the past 2 years has been one giant lie. To have someone so prominent in your life that it was practically structured around them, just for them to reveal everything was pretend, that nothing about it mattered. It makes you think back on what was even real about it. The love felt real. I knew she really did love me. But how many people did she treat the same way before? If I was with her any longer I don’t know what would’ve happened to me. 

Why I decided to wait there as she died I don’t entirely know. Maybe it was because I wanted to validate that this hell was truly over, maybe I still wanted answers from her, maybe I really did just want to be with her in her last moments. To her, I was just a flower among the fields she passed through. She plucked me by the stem and took me home. And now I lay on this piss ridden mattress thinking about the life we could’ve had and a child we couldn’t raise together. Something just crawled on my arm. I think there are bed bugs in my room.
