My face warped and relfexed as I awoke to my dreads breath, he had woken me up to drunkly ramble to me. I lay there exhausted He wanted to come in and “tuck me in” he kept talking incoherently, I just remember how big his hands were, he used shake me awake. He used to smack me or punch in every morning. I had black eyes and bruises like you wouldn’t believe. I was small and weak, I didn’t anyone to help me. I still have the scars on my back their long and the memories of the beatings he would give me.

There’s one thing that was the best thing!! I had  plenty of comic books to read, the basics X-men, Superman, spiderman, they were like my friends, my family! I would read the same ones over and over. They beat up the villains and go home to their families. I used to wonder why? Why didn’t spider kill the green goblin? If he offed him he wouldn’t have to deal with him anymore? I used to draw up hero’s all the time. I loved to watch Batman cartoons! And I even remember my mother having a half hearted super man birthday party for me when I was growing up. But unlike the hero’s I couldn’t beat my villains


. I remember this one night I would walk into his room, my mom staying next to him. I saw how he slept, peacefully. It made me so mad I wanted nothing to feel the love how I felt for him. My mom wasn’t much help, she was an enabler and only cared when he drained their savings on drugs. Opioids, pot, liquor. She divorced him and kicked him out. I remember how she used to just stare at me. I know I look like my father, people tell me all the time and it drives me mad. Sooner or later my mom couldn’t stand to look at me and sent me to my grandmothers. The suitcase was light proably not even a pound I didn’t have much, I didn’t really need much. and her house was old. She was a nicer lady but it just confused me, she hugged me for the first time and I flinched. She would cry sometimes and I don’t know why. 



That was 8 years ago now,I’m older and bigger now. It took a while but I finally got a decent job, making decent money and living a decent life. One day when I returned home and let me just ask have you ever had a really bad day? Like a really bad one? My mother called for the first time in like what? 6 years to talk and tell me about her new porch! Can you belive this? A new porch. She didn’t even say I love you, she bragged about her new house, she told me how happy she was. She didn’t even ask how I was. It hit me, I snapped and just couldn’t handle it. I spent two years in that fucking shrinks office to handle this and all I get is it listen to her talk about her fucking porch.

I made it. I really fucking did it, the red leggings shined in the lamp. My hands hurt like hell from sowing it, the black and red top stood tall it was just perfect. The gloves boots even the mask. I went to 4 different stores I got steak knife’s I sharpened till they could cut a single blade of glass perfectly in half. Smoke bombs, and then there’s the main tool, it cost me so much but it was so fucking worth it. It was a large revolver, it felt so good in my hand. 


I had the biggest smile as I put the suit on. I looked in the mirror and for the first time in my life I didn’t see my father. I saw him. The red reaper. And he was perfection. It took me 4 months to find my dad. My mom’s pretty…. Let’s say forgetful but after some internet sloothing and Facebook hopping. I found him. He was homeless, not surprising after he spent 1,800 on alchohol over the course of 2 months like he knows how to spend money.  he slept outside methodone clinic, fitting as trash like that couldn’t stand being near their vices.

Then it happend. I jumped from a high ladder and crept on his sleeping body, his ragged breathing I watched his chest fall and rise. It was hypnotic  there in a makeshift tent, a blue tarp coving his old body. I haven’t seen my father in 12 years, I watched him, he had a longer beard and he was skinny. He was weak, still taking the drugs that he used when he was young, I moved closer to him and I remember the rage I felt when he wouldn’t love me. His son, his fucking son. It may have been almost 15 years later but I was still that child, his stupid fucking snoring,his twitches he does when he sleeps! and if that couldn’t be the worst if it that’s when I smelled it, that fucking smell. Liquor….

I grabbed my knife and held it to his body right up to rising chest.I slid the knife into him it was so much of everything I wanted.I held him down as he shook awake. 

Red. It was everywhere, my knife. the bottles. The blood on my gloves. It was a blur, a thrilling blur. I am the red reaper. I stabbed his body so many times. The cheap steak knife broke off on his sternum. I reached for my pistol. It was so large I stuck it into his mouth and as he looked at me I was so close to him. I smelled his breath. His smelly breath. Tobacco, booze, “dad…” was the only word I could say I just felt so much rage, boom. 

His brains covered the back wall. I just stood there….. triumphantly, I stood tall his body lay lifeless as the blood dripped off the wall. I climbed up the fence and made it home. The blood covered my gadgets and parts of his brain got on my uniform. I looked at the mirror and saw him. The red reaper. I remember kicking my feet dancing and doing poses with my tools! I only wish I could have had someone like that when I was younger. I turned to the mirror and smiled. I think the red reaper was just getting started
