Hi. It's Reyna. 

Before anyone panics, Nessa is okay. We got the stag out of her. She doesn't remember anything except for bits and pieces, so I figured it'd be good to jump on here and explain what happened. Me being on here is only temporary; she'll be back once she's had some time to recover. I just didn't want to leave anyone waiting in suspense for too long. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

To start, the exorcism didn't go as planned. Everything kind of spiraled out of control after that. This wasn't a normal parasite that we were dealing with. I'll be honest, I've never seen anything like it. 

Normally, when these things take someone over, the host's body must be made to be as inhospitable as possible in order to remove it. This can be done by dousing the host with saltwater or special oils, though I should also mention that certain kinds of parasites are vulnerable to holy objects. 

Forgive me if it sounds like I'm being overly vague going forward, but I won't o go into too much detail about my methods. This is because I don't want to encourage anyone to attempt to do this themselves. Exorcisms are dangerous business. Just trying to perform one puts a target on your back, so if you don't know what you're doing, you're essentially offering yourself up on a silver platter to these things. You also could make the possession even worse for the host. These parasites are like human abusers: failed attempts to help the host may result in retaliation against them. 

At the point of performing the exorcism, Nessa was still in control, but she looked *bad.* She was shivering and shiny with sweat. The scars through her right eyebrow and the corner of her mouth looked even deeper than usual. Her blonde hair was sticking to her face and her usual ponytail was a mess. Her eyes were dull, occasionally flickering to something only she could see. Whatever it was, it wasn't pleasant.  

I'd never seen her look this weak before. I didn't even think it was possible for her to look weak. 

She didn't react when I drew the cross over her, dark eyes staring into space as I prayed for the white stag to release her from its clutches. 

The creep that lives next door to her pounded on the wall. If we'd been doing this in the middle of the night, I would've understood, but it was *noon.* I ignored the interruption and kept going. Meanwhile, Nessa glared at the wall as if she wanted to tell the old guy off. 

When I sprinkled saltwater over her head, she flinched, shutting her eyes when it touched her skin. Victor stayed close by, ready to restrain her if needed. 

Normally, by this point, the parasite should begin to manifest itself. At this stage, it will fight to keep its hold on the host. But as I continued through my regular procedure, the white stag didn't grace us with its presence. Nessa didn't even try to fend either of us off. 

That wasn't a good sign.

Even so, I kept going. Maybe the stag was waiting to defend itself until the last minute? It's unusual, but it has happened before. I had her drink the saltwater. She did it without hesitation, but grimaced at the taste. Once she'd downed all of it, she coughed. 

Nothing happened. 

Nessa looked up at me and slowly shook her head. 

She whispered, “It's not going anywhere.”

Trying not to sound nervous, I asked, “Is it… saying anything to you?”

She shook her head again. 

“Okay…” I started, trying to think. Some of these things need more encouragement than others to leave a body than just prayers of purification and saltwater. Sometimes they need an offering. 

I asked her about her dreams, thinking that there could be a clue about what kind of offering the stag would prefer. She mentioned that in one nightmare, the stag had been chilling beneath the Lovers’ Tree. It wasn't much to go off of, but it was something. 

Victor was going to stay with her to make sure that she couldn't leave. The Weeper had already left to find Nessa a new hagstone. We all had our duties. 
Before I set off, I surrounded the couch in a circle of salt to make sure that she couldn't go anywhere. It felt wrong keeping her prisoner in her own apartment, but it had to be done. She didn't have any hard feelings, but I noticed that she kept staring at the salt surrounding her, her brows drawn together anxiously. 

If the salt trap was upsetting her, that meant that she didn't have much time left before the white stag took her over.

Even though I didn't want to bring that energy into the world, I also had a bad feeling that if Psycho Mantis knew that she was weakened, he'd find some way to take advantage of it. Both the Weeper and I would have to be quick.   

I took the company truck over to the Lovers’ Tree. I wasn't around this part of Pennsylvania at the time where that couple got slaughtered, but I'd heard the entire gruesome story. It’s a popular one among townies. To tell the truth, I'd expected the hawthorn to be a lot bigger or… I don't know, just scarier, somehow. But it was just a tree. A pretty tree that at this point in the season had already grown bright red berries. 

Hold on. Were those berries what the white stag wanted? 

Thankfully, it's not as tall as some trees are. One of the branches was low enough that even I could reach them. But when I saw the dead couple's names scratched into its bark, surrounded by a poorly drawn heart, I hesitated. What if the hawthorn got angry with me for taking them? 

Could I just… ask? Was that stupid?

Feeling silly, I stammered to the tree, “Hey, uh… is it alright if I take some berries? I promise, it's for a good cause.”

A breeze softly blew its branches, causing them to rustle together. That's when I noticed a crow perched on one of the top branches, beady little eyes staring at me. I froze, my mind automatically going back to when the Wild Hunt's crows had tried to tear my eyes right out of my skull. 

My hagstone didn't react. Even so, the paranoia won, so I tore it out from beneath my shirt to look at the bird through the stone's center. To my relief, it was just a regular, garden variety crow. Once again, I felt like an idiot.

Something small bounced off of my head. A berry. Another dropped onto my shoulder. Without letting myself think about it too much, I put my hand out experimentally. Three berries landed in my palm. 

I guess the tree gave me permission. I began to fill my pockets with as many as I could, wanting to make sure that I'd have enough to do whatever I needed to do. 

Shouldn't I be used to weird things like this happening by now? I know Victor and Nessa have been doing this a lot longer than I have, but I'd like an exact timeframe on when I can be as unbothered as they are. To tell the truth, I feel like a Muppet masquerading as a pest control specialist most of the time, especially compared to them. 

Unable to shake the feeling that I looked ridiculous, I told the tree I appreciated the berries, knowing better than to say, ‘thank you.’

Just as I was about to return to the truck, another crow fluttered down. That one made my hagstone shake. 

*Oh no.*

I became acutely aware of the skin around my eyes then. I remember all too well the sensation of talons and beaks scraping at my face. Admittedly, I'm still not quite brave enough to see what they really look like, especially after hearing Nessa's description. 

The ‘crow’ wasn't alone. More of them had begun to circle overhead. I began to haul ass to the truck, feeling a few berries drop out of my pocket in my haste. The crows started to call to me. I withdrew my water pistol. 

My voice embarrassingly shaky, I shouted, “The tree let me take them, alright?! I asked first!”

There was no way that they weren't going to tell one of the higher ranking Hunters about this. I needed to get out of there before one of them showed up. The crows continued to hover over me as I made my way back to the truck. What really got my heart pounding was when I saw some of them split off while the others continued to follow me even as I slammed the door shut. 

*The Hunt is going to hang my entrails from the Lovers’ Tree. They're going to slaughter me just like they did that couple. And Nessa's being possessed by a fucking deer and-*

“No,” I said out loud as I got the truck started. “I can't spiral. Not now.”

As the murder of crows continued to pursue me, I wondered if I should try to lose them, but there wasn't time for that. With possessions, every second counts. Besides, some of them already went off to tell their commander anyways. No matter what I did, Psycho Mantis was going to find us. I just had to hope that we could free Nessa before he showed up. 

When I got back to Nessa's apartment, she wasn't her anymore. 

It was a good thing that we trapped her in salt beforehand. She was sitting stiffly on the couch, head tilted downwards. Her eyes had faded into an unnatural shade of blue, so pale to the point that they were almost white. Her lips were moving quickly as if chanting, but I couldn't hear what she was saying. It was probably better that way. 

Victor, arms crossed, observed her silently from across the room. 

“How long has she been like this?” I asked, not daring to look away from her. 

“Stag took over about five minutes after you left. Chanting started as soon as that happened.”

“Has she been violent at all?”

“Not yet. Hasn't even tried to escape.”

That was not normal behavior for the possessed. Typically, their first impulse is to eliminate everyone that they hold dear. Unless Nessa secretly hates us, then what that would mean is that this parasite had more in mind for her than just a simple takeover. 

I produced the berries from my pockets. Hawthorn berries aren't toxic as long as you deseed them; their seeds cause cyanide toxicity at high enough doses. I hurried into the kitchen to prepare them. 

My idea was to begin with offering the white stag the berries raw first. If that had no effect, I could make them into a decoction to use for another attempt to exorcize the parasite. I didn't let myself think about what would happen if the dream was just a dream and these hawthorn berries weren't actually Nessa's golden ticket to freedom. They *had* to work. 

As I cut the seeds out, I said to Victor, “Oh, just so you know, the Wild Hunt's murder birds followed me. Some of them flew elsewhere.”

He sighed, “Great. More problems.”

“I asked the Lovers’ Tree before I took the fruit, so…” I trailed off. 

“As long as you had permission, they should have no reason to come after you. Must mean they're focused on something else. Or some*one* else.”

I'll give you all one guess who that ‘someone else’ was. 

Once the berries were deseeded, I arranged them on a plate like a proper offering. Not the prettiest thing in the world, but it would do. 

After taking a deep breath, I brought it with me to stand before the white stag, taking care to not disturb the circle of salt yet. The chanting didn't stop. 

I spoke firmly to get its attention, “I have a gift for you. In exchange, you must release the woman you've inhabited.”

The chanting halted abruptly. Nessa's head tilted up. This close, I could see movement under her skin, like snakes slithering beneath sand. My stomach turned as a particularly large one slunk around the thin skin of her cheek. 

For her sake, I'm so glad Nessa doesn't remember that part of her possession. With how much they freak her out, I think she'd take critical psychological damage. I want to peel off my own skin just thinking about it. 

The white stag’s lip curled at the berries in a disgusted snarl. Shocked by its reaction, I hurriedly set the plate down on an end table that was out of her line of sight. A low growl came from Nessa's throat then. 

Something I've always hated about myself is that I'm an easy crier. Immediately, I was fighting tears as I said, “What offering would suit you more?”

When it spoke, it sounded nothing like Nessa. “My freedom. Release me from this trap.”

“I can't do that. Not until you let that woman go.”

The stag’s eyes shut, the squirming beneath Nessa's skin growing more urgent, “She disturbed me. Destroyed me. She will repay me with her flesh.”

This was going nowhere. Without another word, I returned to the kitchen, snatching the plate as I passed by. 

The white stag had reacted aggressively when presented with the berries. Time for plan B. I chopped the berries up as small as I could. Ordinarily, with decoctions I'd use water, but time was of the essence, so I tossed the berries into a pot with eight ounces of 100 proof vodka. You'd be amazed at how useful liquor is for situations like this. I always keep it on hand. 

While I got to work, Victor peered out the window before informing me, “The Lessers have gathered outside. No sign of the mechanic yet. Or the Weeper, for that matter.”

Stirring the mixture, I voiced my concerns out loud, “Do you think they'd hurt her? The Weeper, I mean?”

“Probably.” He replied flatly as he nudged the blinds back into place. 

It took fifteen minutes for the decoction to become the proper consistency. I strained it into a mug using a coffee filter, then once that was done, the decoction was ready. I just needed to let it cool enough so that I wouldn't accidentally burn Nessa. 

My heart stopped when I heard one single note from a banjo string. 

Everyone in the room, including the white stag, began to watch the door. My hagstone was going crazy, shaking against where it hung beneath my shirt. 

Three months ago, if someone would've told me that I'd be as afraid of a redneck fairy as I am of Satan himself, I would've laughed nervously and asked them what they were smoking. Yet there I was, a painful knot forming in my throat as my mind went back to the memory of his pliers tightening around my pinky nail. That was followed by his laugh echoing in my ears as I begged him not to kill me. 

Victor shook his head then, brows crinkling together as if he were in pain. I asked him what was wrong, but he didn't respond, clenching his teeth as he braced himself against the wall. The song continued. Gradually, Victor's face and arms relaxed. 

I watched helplessly as he went to the door and politely held it open for the devil to come in. 

Psycho Mantis strode in like he owned the place. I suppose he thinks he does. He didn't pay Victor or I even a passing glance as he knelt in front of the white stag at the edge of the salt circle, propping his arm up on top of his banjo with that catlike smile of his. The white stag simply stared at him, completely immobile. 

Now that he wasn't under the Huntsman's influence anymore, Victor was glaring down at him. 

He managed to sound more professional than I would have, “We had an agreement that our organizations wouldn't interfere with one another.”

Psycho Mantis smirked at him, “Do I look like I'm interferin’, blue eyes?”

“If you're not here to stop us, then what are you here for?”

Instead of answering him, the Hunter straightened up, turning his attention to me, “This what you took them berries for, witch doctor?”

Swallowing in an effort to get that lump in my throat to go away, I nodded, knowing that if I spoke my voice would shake.

Psycho Mantis regarded me coldly as he said, “You best get to it then. I'll make sure this fuck doesn’t get to you, too.”

*He's helping us? No way. I don't trust like that.*

Victor obviously felt the same way since he protested, “We've already got this covered. There's no need for you to be here.”

The white stag’s jaw dropped, allowing one of those terrible worms to extend from Nessa's throat like an absurd, sentient tongue. It was at least six feet long, swaying ominously as if trying to decide which one of us it wanted to burrow into first. 

“You wanna try gettin’ close to her?” Psycho Mantis gave Victor a sly smile, “Come on, blue eyes, I dare ya!”

*Okay. He's got us.*

Victor came to the same conclusion and let out a harsh breath, “*Shit.*”

The Hunter picked up his instrument again as he chuckled at Victor's begrudging acceptance. I couldn't stop myself from thinking about how satisfying it would be for Victor to punch him right then. It wouldn't end well for anyone, but the idea was nice. 

“I thought your instrument didn't work on her anymore?” Victor asked suspiciously as I hesitantly approached with the decoction in hand. 

“Yeah, but it ain't her anymore, now, is it?” Psycho Mantis replied, smiling darkly. “Why do you think it's actin’ all tough? Poor lil’ thing's scared.”

The white stag slowly rose from where it had been sitting, the worm hanging out of  Nessa's mouth whipping through the air to face me threateningly. That's what it looked like scared? Good Lord.  

*Why do they have to have so many teeth?*

Victor and I glanced at each other. He was just as unsure about this as I was, but we had to save her, even if it meant having to deal with whatever Psycho Mantis’ ulterior motives were. Things like him don't do things out of the kindness of their hearts. He definitely had something in mind. Eyes hard as if preparing for the worst, Victor nodded at me. 

*Here goes everything.*

I took a deep breath and broke the salt circle. 

The white stag’s worm-tongue lunged for me before I even had time to blink, but it didn't reach me. Psycho Mantis was playing again. The worm's mouth was sliced clean off in one segment, falling to the carpet, rolling against my foot. I stepped over it with an embarrassing squeak that escaped my mouth unintentionally. If Psycho Mantis thought I was the weakest link before, he probably didn't even consider me a part of the chain anymore after hearing that noise. 

The banjo was plucked again, that same unseen force roughly shoving Nessa back onto the couch. Heart beating in my ears, I took the chance, jumping onto her and pouring the decoction down her throat. From the moment it touched her tongue, her body began to convulse, those strange pale eyes rolling into the back of her head as she went limp against the cushions. The nightmarish squirming beneath her skin began to cease. 

*It's working! Thank God, it's working!*

That's when I felt two strong arms wrap around my midsection. Victor? *What is he doing?!* 

He dragged me away from her despite how hard I was flailing, his forearm coming to wrap around my throat, trapping me against him with ease. I saw his reflection in the hall mirror. His eyes were glazed over, just like how they were when he let the Hunter in.

Psycho Mantis winked at me, “I'll take it from here.” 

*No!* Alarmed, I tried yanking Victor's arms off of me as I screamed hard enough to make my throat hurt well into the next day, “*Get away from her!*”

Victor isn't human and it shows in his strength. I watched, helplessly caged in his arms as the Huntsman gently cupped Nessa's chin with his fingertips, forcing her to look into his eyes. 

Whatever he was trying to do, I knew it couldn't be good. I elbowed Victor in the gut repeatedly and dug my heel into his instep, just like how Nessa taught me. His grip loosened and I took the chance to slip out, but I didn't get far before he pulled me back. 

*Come on, Vic! Snap out of it!*

Psychic Mantis covered Nessa's eyes and leaned close, whispering something into her ear. Desperate, I got the Squelcher out and sprayed saltwater at Victor's forehead. 

*Sorry, big guy.* 

He staggered away from me, blinking like he'd just woken up from a deep sleep. 

With stress tears blurring my vision, I tore away from him and took aim at Psycho Mantis next. But before I could pull the trigger, he pulled away from her with a tearing noise that shook me to my core. I’d thought for sure that he'd ripped her in two, but when my gaze flitted to her in a panic, I saw that not only was her anatomy still intact, her eyes were brown again. Blood flowed from them like tears. 

When I glanced back at the Hunter, I saw that he held a white stag in one hand, yanking it roughly by the antler away from her. His intervention made sense then. He's an expert at ripping souls out and parasites like the white stag are just that: miserable souls that need to find another body to hijack in order to keep from fading away. 

The white stag brayed, trying to wrench out of his grasp as he wrestled it to the ground, pressing his knee into its slender throat as he knelt over it, not letting go of its antlers. Its legs kicked, hooves thudding loudly against the carpet. 

He tossed a harsh glance over his shoulder as he held the otherworldly animal down. “Y’all wanna keep fuckin’ standing there or is one of ya gonna give me a hand?”

Victor subtly rolled his eyes, but joined him on the ground as the headless worm shot out of the stag’s mouth, harmlessly smacking him in the shoulder. The thing's entire body twitched as it carried on releasing those strangled whines. 

In hindsight, I'd *love* to know how me reading a prayer to Nessa was too loud for her creep ass neighbor, but *this* wasn't. Psycho Mantis must've had something to do with it. 

When I read everything back, it makes it seem like all of this unfolded over time, but in reality, everything had happened so fast. 

Nessa backpedaled away, her breathing heavy as she looked around in bewilderment. As I reached for her to check on her, a snapping sound made me jump. My head whipped to locate the source, finding Psycho Mantis impatiently snapping his fingers at me like I was a disobedient dog. 

Eyes narrowed at me, he said, “Don't make me repeat myself. Do you have any more of that berry mixture or not?”

I hadn't even realized he'd spoken. Flustered, I glanced down at the mug in my hand. There was about an eighth of it left, which I told him. 

“Bring it here.” He commanded, voice low and cold enough to freeze my marrow. 

Afraid to irritate him any more, I did as I was instructed, handing the mug off to Victor. The stag struggled beneath them both again, pale eyes wild as it failed to buck either of them off. Gritting his teeth as Psycho Mantis held the creature's head in place, Victor pried the white stag's jaws open, then poured what remained of the decoction into its mouth. 

Psycho Mantis sneered down at the stag, “I'm going to mount your head in my shop.”

Smoke began to fill the room, the source being the stag's twitching form. Victor leapt away from it. At the same time, Psycho Mantis kept his word and savagely ripped the stag's skull from its neck. After that, the bizarre animal's pelt simply slid off, revealing stringy red muscle beneath. The smell of burnt meat filled my nostrils as what was left of the stag began to liquify until it resembled clumpy melted wax. 

For a minute, I was fixated on it, disturbed, but for reasons I can't explain, unable to look away as it began to bubble. My stomach churned as it occurred to me that we were going to have to clean this up. 

Nessa sprang off the couch, clumsily avoiding the stag sludge as if afraid that just being near it would cause another infestation. Victor reached out and stabilized her by catching her elbow. 

Eyes huge, she sounded panicked as she breathed, “I'm not… is this real?”

Victor gave her a sympathetic look, “You're back. Just try to breathe, alright?”

Her bloodshot eyes fell on Psycho Mantis and she noticeably stiffened. I still had my Squelcher out, ready to give him a quick spray, if needed. 

Blood continued to drip from the stag's decapitated head and onto Nessa's floor as he calmly bent to retrieve his instrument from the ground.

I don't know where it came from, but for the first time that evening, I got brave enough to demand, “What did you do to her?”

He raised an eyebrow at me, looking me up and down as if my outburst was more amusing than offensive, “You were there, witch doctor. You saw me save her life.”

It took a moment for the gravity of his words to set in, but when they did, I swore. A life debt. She now owes him a life debt. 

Nessa turned bright red as the realization hit her at the same time as it did for me, then her eyebrows came together in a scowl, “Did you know this was going to happen? Is that why you brought me down to the mines?”

“Nope.” His smile belonged to someone warmer, kinder. “Believe or not, I didn't want that shit takin’ you away from me any more than you did. But hey, when opportunities come a’ knockin’, ya answer!”

Her lips trembled with fury. “You fucking-”

“Careful, pup.” He warned, eyes narrowing dangerously. 

His tone and expression made me want to shrink inside myself. Whatever it was she was going to say, Nessa thought better of it, opting instead to angrily wipe at the blood running down her cheeks. It smeared like war paint.  

*I hope she kills you someday. She said it wasn't possible, but everything has to die, doesn't it?* 

The Huntsman's voice remained heart stoppingly low as he told her, “You best be ready to comply when I decide to collect what's mine. I won't tolerate any more bullshit from you. You understandin’ me pup?”

Her jaw hard and cheeks flushed, she dared to look him in the eyes as she nodded. 

His demeanor lightened slightly as he gave us all one last smile. “Y'all have a great rest of your evening. And it was a real *pleasure* workin’ with ya.”

To our collective relief, he left us alone, the stag's decapitated head leaving a trail of blood that led out through the doorway.

Once we were fully alone, Nessa collapsed into Victor's arms. When I rushed over, about to ask if she was hurt, she looped a long arm around me, smashing me against her and Vic. For a moment, we all just held each other. I think we all needed the assurance that Nessa was okay and that she was still *her.*

Eventually, Victor muttered that he was going to put on some coffee. It may sound  standoffish to those who don't know him, but honestly, it was a miracle he allowed that much physical affection. That draugr is *not* a hugger. He must've been just as afraid of losing her as I was. 

Nessa leaned heavily into me once he slipped away, almost knocking us both over. The woman is a giant and all muscle. As I staggered to keep us both upright, she laughed softly, then sniffed. I squeezed her as tightly as I was able to, trying to reassure her that she was back inside of her own body. 

As you can probably imagine, possessions are extremely traumatic. For some victims, they're trapped, watching like they're in the backseat of a car as the parasite takes control. For others, they're stuck in a hellish dreamlike state, only marginally aware of what's happening to them. Nessa's experience was the latter. 

What the hosts remember also is different from person to person. Some can recall every excruciating detail, like the lady we treated from the mansion. Others, like Nessa, have only vague, scattered memories of their possessions. There are even a few I've treated who don't remember anything at all, thinking that the entire incident was just a nightmare. 

There was a gentle knock at the door. Victor checked the peep hole, hand resting on his knife. He then opened the door, revealing the Weeper. 

My first thought was, ‘The stones must be getting harder to come by if it took that long.’ But then the clock on Nessa's oven caught my eye and I realized that only an hour had passed since she went to search for a hagstone. *An hour?* How was it possible for so much to happen in such a short amount of time?

Of course, she was completely blindsided by the state of the apartment. When she realized that the stag was taken care of, she ran into Nessa's arms. In turn, Nessa buried her bloodied face into the Weeper’s glossy white hair. 

The Weeper offered to help her into the shower, going into nurse mode. Meanwhile, Victor stared begrudgingly at the stag soup on the carpet from where he stood in the kitchen. 

With a heavy sigh, I said, “Guess we should start cleaning this up for her.”

“In a minute,” He replied, taking a sip of fresh coffee. “I think we all need a breather.”

I sat down at the small table in the kitchen, putting my face in my hands, willing myself not to cry. My therapist has been telling me that crying isn't a bad thing. Since I was a kid, it was always an admission of softness. How could that *not* be a bad thing? 

“You did good today, Reyna. But next time, shoot me faster.” Victor told me as I hid. 

I feel bad that he feels the need to assure me all the time. I really need to toughen up. 

Wiping away the rogue tears at the corners of my eyes, I looked up at him and let out a shaky breath. 

“I'll do better.” I promised with an embarrassing little voice crack. 

“Don't be so hard on yourself. A lot of things could've gone smoother today; hell, I slipped up and let that asshole get into my head and use me. What matters is that we got her back.”

Just the mention of that psychopath got me even more upset. I grumbled, “What’s his deal with her anyway? He’s like… obsessed with her.” 

Victor took another sip of coffee, then replied as he stared into the dark liquid, “Why else? She’s the one that got away.”

The Weeper rejoined us, leaving Nessa to clean herself up. We caught her up on the shitstorm that happened while she was doing her thing. She didn't say a word, just listened. I think she felt bad about not getting back to us in time to help out, but it really wasn't her fault. On the bright side, she did get another hagstone. Lord knows Nessa's gonna need it. 

In case anyone was wondering, it took us almost three hours to clean all the gore up, and there were some stains we just couldn't get out no matter what we used or how hard we scrubbed. RIP to Nessa's security deposit.

We wouldn't let Nessa help us, even though she kept trying. She’d already been through enough, but try telling her that. That woman is *stubborn.* After being chased away a few times, she eventually gave up and went to sleep. The Weeper offered to stay and watch over her. 

On a more positive note, at least now we know that hawthorn berries are the cure for these worms. And now that their leader is dead (hopefully permanently this time,) we might be able to get rid of this deer epidemic once and for all. 

So… yeah. That's what happened. I don't know how to end this, so just know that Orion's giantess is free from her wormy prison and will be back soon. 🤙
