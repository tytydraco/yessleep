If you read the title and are wondering who  Ted is  let me tell you some things about him even thought I think most people around here would know about . Ted the protagonist of what I until recently thought to be a fictional story. But it's real every part of it.

 I have been exploring caves for almost a decade now I wouldn't consider myself an expert by any means as I only explored a couple a year but I know a thing or two. So when I heard about an cave  entrance being unearthed by an earthquake I knew I was going to explore it . It wasn't exactly a Virgin it was connected to another well known cave in the area but it was surely going to have some new parts. When I entered the first thing I noticed was the smell dust and earth filled my nostrils leaving an stale taste in my mouth.

 The passage itself was at the entrance quit spacious but soon I had to continue on my knees as it's height dropped to about one and a half meters thankfully this part of the passage extended only for about five meters so I quickly passed it and continued forwards . I should also mention that I had brought with me two light sources a headlight  which I was now wearing and a flashlight in case it failed. I have to admit thought the cave was beautiful crystal formations were on the wall and floor glittering in the light. After about half an hour I decided to stop and rest a little before continuing. Standing  there leaning against the wall I saw something.

 It was on the ceiling it took me a moment to realize what it was a drawing? I mattered to myself half expecting a response. I looked closer was able to make out the figures of humans with their hands in the air the painting continued s little further I expected to see an animal like horses I have read that those were popular amongst cave people but no what I saw was a large black figure . I wasn't sure what it was, It was composed  multiple black lines it seemed to be facing the humans but I am not sure about it . It may even had been a figure in the first place it could have been just a rock or a place .

 I continued forwards I was a little unnerved by the painting but also exited I had uncovered something possibly going back centuries ago . I continued walking looking for more when I found another one if I had to guess, I would say that it was about fifteen meters away from the last one. This one depicted a group of people drawn in a similar way to the last now surrounding an weird symbols it was a straight line cutting through two rectangles. This time I had no theories about what it could be . I stopped and  looked straight to the rest of the passage I had to ways to continue one path led to an smaller passage tilted to about forty five degrees, the other led to a dead end .

 Well not exactly there was a hole in the wall maybe it was large enough for me to crawl through but I wasn't taking any chances.

 I head into the other passage and started my descent that's when I made my first mistake in here I tripped and fell hitting my head as I rolled down my headlight breaking at the process when I stopped rolling I got up and started looking for my flashlight when I found it and turned it on my blood froze I screamed and fell on my knees before me where three skeletal figures. I stopped screaming when I realized they were dead sitting there on there knees facing me bones were visible and slime or mud covered them. Seeing this my stomach could not take it and I vomited. When I got back on my feet and looked around the room was an almost perfect rectangles it's walks were covered in claw marks. 

 That I decided that I was getting the hell out of there but then I noticed something on the floor and went to pick it up . I am not sure what it was but it looked like a glow stick. That's when I heard the cracking of Bones I turned around only to see the figures clawing at me I screamed from sock and pain . The skeletal fingers  my skin one even tried gauging out my left eye they were fast but their grips were weak . I broke free and run leaving everything behind except from flashlight I almost stumbled and fell many times as I herd them getting closer  but managed to get out I looked behind but didn't see anything following me I run to the car.
It's been three days since then I told the doctors that my wounds were from the fall they didn't seem to believe me  but went with it anyway . Most of them have healed but I will have some scars for the rest of my life especially the one on my eye. 
 After going home I did my research and Ted's story seems to be the only 
explanation to what I saw .

 I Will not provide any information for the location of the cave as I don't  for anyone's death. The worst part to it isn't the three figures but what other was once there but now is free the figures weren't the masters of the cave something much more sinister lives there the thing from the drawing I am sure of it. I have to go now my cousin has come to pick me up I will stay with for a little while not only to feel safe even though the nightmares I've been having have left me exhausted but also because yesterday I want to take out the trash and found my headlight in my front step covered in mud.
