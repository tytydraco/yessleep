When the aliens arrived for us, it was not from above. It was from all around. 
 
*Danger*. My grandmother’s wide eyes had shone a bleak warning at me, stroking my head while we finished our meal a sunset ago. 

Grandmother was old, eyes beginning to cloud over milky-white. But before she had begun to need help foraging her portion of a sun’s meal, she had seen more than all the tribe’s young ones put together. 

The awful pounding, as if the earth itself was being cracked and split like the shell of a nut, we heard for days before I saw them. 

I was the first in my tribe to see them. Perched on a high branch, stripping fruits from their stems, I watched the top of the hillside as the first beast dragged itself into view. 

Covered in neither hair nor fur, you could see their black blood, pumping frantically through tubes on the outside like a dying thing. Their outsides, almost like water, shone like the ripple-skin of the lake.
Their bodies, a thousand times bigger than any creature I knew existed, twisted wrongly and oozing across the ground like slugs, leaving trails of foulness in their wake.

It didn’t matter what they wanted. We were no strangers to death, and my instincts made me scream the alarm even as I felt paralyzed by the newness of this threat. 

I found Grandmother in the clearing where we had slept, broken teeth bared with fear.  Already, the pounding was so close, so close, shaking my limbs even as I tried to help her own trembling body onto all fours. 

She didn’t need words for me to understand her cries. I could not carry her. She would become the creatures’ next meal as they crashed through green forest. Or we both would. Wordlessly, she screamed at me to run. 

So I ran. 

I ran as fast as I could, but the noise- awful splintering, more terrible than even the worst summer storm I remembered. It was otherworldly the way these beasts needed neither rest nor food as I stumbled away. The sounds of destruction intensified, and faster than any creature I had ever seen, the enemy was on me. 

 In desperation, I fumbled for a nearby rock and hurled it at the closest one. Instead of sinking like a stone in a lake, I watched helplessly as the ripple-skin shimmer sent it rebounding without even a hint of harm. 

There was nowhere to go. I could hear, feel, the rumbling approaching from all sides. And so, pure instinct drove me up the tree while I watched myself be surrounded. 

I closed my eyes and waited for the blow to the trunk that would send me tumbling to the ground. 

When I could open my eyes against the blinding pain, I no longer recognized my family’s territory. I could taste the flesh-salt in my mouth, and one foot bent horribly and sent shivers of agony through me when I weakly tried to grasp around with it. 

But I didn’t know how to give up and die. I had spent too long learning to avoid danger, to fight when I had to, to spend my suns collecting nourishment for the next sun, trying to survive. 

So, I moved. 

I would not survive alone, and it kept me moving forward, like the familiar creatures that crawl in the dirt. The thought of standing never crossed my mind. I could only drag myself, belly scraping on broken twigs, towards the others. 

The salt-tang of hurt fills my nostrils long before I see Grandmother lying twisted on the ground. She’s stopped trembling. I shake her, and though she looks like she’s sleeping, I know. *Gone*. *Gone*. *Gone*.

*All of it, gone*. The shining beasts still growl nearby, the splintering of trunks growing near again. And Grandmother’s back and shoulders turn redder and redder, caking the graying patches of her neck and back. I feel it too, wet-warm and dripping from my stinging, hairless palms. 

I howl one last call of grief and rage at these strangers, invaders. 

 I can only watch as one beast oozes to a shuddering halt a tree length’s away. A grating hiss, and the creature splits along its flank. The hairless offspring steps out, two-footed and utterly foreign. 

I will fight for my tribe as long as I am able to, but I remember how my rock glanced off the creature’s skin like a falling leaf. And the pain begins to darken the edges of my world. 

“No, twenty-two acres, right, yeah, we’re looking right on schedule. No problems here, boss.”
