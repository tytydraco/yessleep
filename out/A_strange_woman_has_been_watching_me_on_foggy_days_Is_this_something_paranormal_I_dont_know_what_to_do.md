Hey everyone. I know i look like w complete fool writing here of all places. But there's been something that's been troubling me lately...

I'm a 19 year old guy who hasn't been interested or has never believed in the paranormal. I live in a fairly rural area in Cornwall, England.

Since cornwall is a pretty cold and humid place, it can sometimes have mornings where the usually serene and happy little fields are masked by a thick fog. This is not too uncommon, but usually happens during the winter season.

Alright, enough backstory. I'm an observant person who can often see things that people don't usually see at first glance, a good example of this is when watching some horror movie that has background details that can be subtle at times.

One morning on a chilly sunday afternoon, I soon find out that something just feels off. I shrugged it off as my anxiety just going out of wack for no apparent reason.

I sat down, turned on the TV, and opened the curtains. But something was definitely wrong with the usual calm landscape.

There squatted a dense fog that seemed to obscure most of the field that was in the distance.

I couldn't help but notice the feeling that I was being observed. And i was right.

As much as I wanted believe that there was nothing wrong with the distance, i was mistaken.

There. Standing and watching from afar, a disheveled woman in grey with soulless sunken eyes stared right back at me. I instinctively closed the curtains and ran back to my parents bedroom, my heart pounding as if it were going to explode.

"Mum!" "MUM WAKE THE FUCK UP!"

My mother hates it when I swear in the house.

"I beg your pardon!?" My mother replied sternly.

"THIS IS SERIOUS!"

I was absolutely riddled with anxiety. I hurried my mother into the living room where i saw whatever that thing was.

I threw open the curtains in a hurry. Pointed to where i saw it. But there was nothing there. I stared in bewilderment at hiw such a thing can travel so fast.

That night, i had a horrible fever, and you bet that it really didn't help with sleep. I woke up the morning after as if nothing had happened yesterday morning. But i'm sure I saw it. The thing that scared me the most about seeing that, was that I lived in the middle of nowhere. There was no one living near me for a good sevwn or so miles.

I will never forget that day when I saw whatever that "thing" was. I can't forget it. It haunts me

There are some things in life that are completely unexplainable. Sometimes some of them should remain unexplained. The things that i had seen that day shook me to my core and i wish i had never seen it. Then i would be blissfully ignorant.

Never let curiosity take over your life. It can break you in the most brutal ways. I'm gonna go take a nap now. I need to collect my thoughts.
