I move forward, unaware of any meaningful sense of direction. I am just following that noise, that voice. I know I heard it; I have never heard a real voice so clearly here before, only those subtle whispers. My eyes finally start to adjust to the dim phosphorescent light, and I can see slightly better now. 

The path leads me down to another junction, this time a choice between left and right. I pause for a moment and listen. I spend several minutes standing there, trying to hear any hint of that voice that led me down this path. Then, just as I am beginning to question my decision to follow the sound, I hear it again, faintly down the corridor to the right. I rush down the hall and nearly slip on a trail of some type of liquid. It is a sort of brackish brown liquid that almost looks like sewer water. Fortunately, it does not smell too bad, but I try to walk carefully so I don't slip in it all the same.

The temperature is plummeting as I move and I fear that if I did fall and soak my clothes, I might freeze before I can find the source of that voice. More importantly, I need to try and find the hidden chamber while I am still feeling fresh. The longer I stay in here the harder it will be to not only find the chamber, but escape alive.

I jog further down the hall. The walls seem to close in as the once broad corridor narrows, and more of the brackish water flows down the channel below, like a morbid aqueduct.

I look up and suppress a gasp when I see a figure disappearing through a tunnels up ahead. I can just make out long black hair and a sound, like gasping or panting. This must be the person I heard. Could someone who was trapped here still be alive? I have to check it out, I know it sounds crazy but if one of my family is still alive here, it's worth the risk.

I have to crouch down to pass underneath the small tunnel at the end of the hall. The space becomes uncomfortably narrow. Twice I consider turning back as the situation feels off, but I press on.

My perseverance is rewarded by the tunnel expanding back out into a small room that appears to be a dead end. The dark waters are almost up to my knees, and I wonder where it came from, since no grates or actual plumbing to channel it here are visible. I put the question of the waters origin out of my mind and look around. My shoulders slump in disbelief and despair. I know this was where the figure was heading, there is no exit. I heard the voice, it was here, so where are they?

Then I see it, something on the floor in the corner. The dark waters almost completely cover it, but I see it now. I move toward it and reach down into the grimy water and pull the slumped figure up. I fall back in shock and let go of the form after seeing what it is. I try and control my panicked breathing as I look back down at my morbid discovery. What I see is the bloated corpse of a person, that is so water logged and decayed I cannot even begin to identify them. The worst part is the hollow eye sockets, the sight reminds me of Jaime and chills me when I see how much worse it could have been if he hadn't escaped.

I try to steel myself and look down at the terrible corpse again. Considering where I am, this person must be related to me, but I cannot tell exactly who it is, or rather was, based on what little remains. Then another disturbing fact creeps into my mind. A difference this year, compared to previous visits. I have never found the remains of any family before. I consider the voice I heard and the water logged remains in this room. A shiver passes through me and something feels terribly wrong.

I do not have time to consider my plight when I hear a sound. A low rumble in the water. Then I see the surface begin to shift and vibrate. I take a reflexive step back, but I am frozen in terror when the slumped and decayed form of my dead family member lurches up from the water.

I rub my eyes dumbly as I look at the impossible sight. The green, necrotic flesh sloughs off in the dark water as it stands. It begins to move in an erratic and jerky fashion, like a poorly controlled marionette. It throws itself against the wall and raises its rotting fists to smash uselessly against the surface. A chocking, gurgling sound emanates from it, and to my horror I realize it is trying to speak.

I take a breath and wait for a terrible moment for the reborn figure to say what it is trying to say.

It gasps and putrid water pours from its mouth, emptying the lungs and allowing the stale air of the labyrinth to move through its rotten form.

Then I hear it, the corpses voice, a desperate cry of the damned,

“Help...me...please...let..me...out!”

I take a reflexive step back at the horrible sight of the reanimated form of an ancestor who might have been trapped and killed in this room.

Suddenly it turns around to look at me and stops flailing. It raises a necrotic finger and points at me and speaks again, addressing me directly,

“You.....my......kin......run.....trap...its......a......trap!” Then the dead thing howls in what sounds like pain and the ruined head of my fallen family member falls off and floats in the murky water which I realize is starting to rise. I look back the way I had come from, hoping to flee the horrible room when I see the small crawl space leading back to the hall is closed and the brackish water is rising rapidly from some unknown source. The body of my family member has fallen inert again and I have to find some way of getting out of here before I drown!

The water rises steadily and I look on every wall and in every corner. I try to focus, to look for any possible way to get back out before the water reaches the ceiling and I drown. I can't believe I let myself get lured in here. I know I have to focus on finding a way out, but the image of the eyeless corpse won't leave my panicked mind. What the hell happened to them? What the hell is going to happen to me?

The last few years I just had to survive, to find the way out. It was eerie, it was terrible, but now it's different. My dad was right, something is hunting us, something does not want to let us leave, and it is taking more drastic action to ensure we don't.

The water has risen to the point where I have to swim. A fetor seeps into the room, almost causing me to gag. I grasp the walls and prod, looking for some mechanism to escape or at least stop the water. I try the corners next. As the water carries me nearly to the ceiling of the small room, I finally see it. A small glint of blue, glowing softly in the corner high above where I found the body. I swim over and reach my arm up. I grasp, push, and even punch at the glowing surface. Something gives way just as the water covers my head and I take one last breath of air and hope whatever I did works.

In the next moment, the water begins to recede. It lowers enough for me to lift my head up and take another breath of air.  I am exhausted, but it's alright. I tread water and wait patiently for the level to lower. As I look down in the grimy liquid and see a small whirlpool near where the crawl space was. Perhaps its draining back through there?

After a few minutes I can stand again. I have to rest for a moment to keep from collapsing, but I can finally leave. I crouch down and move out of the deathtrap of a room.

I walk slowly back down the narrow hall and when I exit the tunnel, I am shocked to see that the junction I had come from to get here is gone. There are four paths now, each with a strange glowing glyph near the ceiling.

I have no idea how it changed so quickly. I expect the layout to be different each year, but I try and think back to any instance where the geography has changed while I was in the Labyrinth.

This adds a new problem, but considering that I did not really know where I was going in the first place, my plan does not change. I regard the symbols by each path and do not see any that stand out. I will have to pick a direction. I start moving down the path straight ahead and hope it leads me to where I want to go.
