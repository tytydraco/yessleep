I've always known I grew up in a haunted house. Lights would click on and off by themselves, doors would slam shut, dishes would sometimes fly off the counters, and everyone just accepted it. Living with it for us, was as normal as having a family pet for the rest of you guys. We would make jokes about the ghost coming by to check in on us in the middle of the night. Whatever it was at the time, never tried to harm us in any way. It was like it just wanted to be acknowledged. 
None of us really minded. 

Flash forward about three years later, mid 2013,  the activity stopped all of the sudden when my Nana moved in. To be honest, I was a Nana's girl so if the activity didn't stop or had picked up, I don't think I would've noticed or cared. 

Sadly, late that year, my Nana passed away. Everyone was in disbelief. It was extremely sudden and traumatic. She died of a massive heart attack in our shared room. My mother watched it happen, my dad was too drunk to react appropriately, and my brother and I ran outside to escape the chaos that ensued in the back room. The windows were open, so we could still hear a lot...Just more muddled.

After the shock, the funeral, and private memorial, life slowly went back to normal. 

With one exception, at least for me:
I never opened my eyes at night, and I never walked throughout the house when everyone was asleep. I felt like something was watching me then. Waiting for the perfect moment. The activity picked up more for me in the years following my Nana's death. I would feel something crawl over my feet and legs when I was trying to sleep, my bed would shake without a reasonable explanation, my bedroom door would slam shut right when I would try to leave my room, and my room would often have cigarette smoke in the air, even though at the time, I didn't smoke cigarettes. 

My mother thought I was just missing Nana a lot, so I must've been imagining things. She suggested that maybe Nana left an impression.
I shrugged and left it alone after that. Maybe I was imagining things. Maybe I was just so used to everything be the same before she passed. I tried my best to ignore what went on after that. Hoping that maybe by distracting my brain from missing her, the occurrences would stop. 

News flash! They only got worse.

The more I ignored it, the more I tried my best not to think about it, more crazy shit would happen. This time, occurrences happened during the day while activity amped up at night. My cats wouldn't go near my room, my family and I heard a low groan coming from my bedroom when I wasn't in there, the door would lock itself for hours on end, we would see figures out of the corner of our eyes, heard stomping going up and down the hallway, and so on. 

Mind you, this was DAYTIME. 

We didn't have any helpful avenues, so we stayed together most days. The days that one of us had work or had to go out for something, the other person stayed outside, or in the kitchen where the least amount of activity happened. 

 Two days before my 18th birthday, my closet door had popped open while I was asleep. I woke up just barely to find my Nana standing at the foot of my bed, staring at me. 

But, this wasn't her. This was some fucked up humanoid thing that kind of resembled her? The light that shined through my white curtains illuminated it's face just enough that I could see that it had black pits for eyes, am unnaturally wide mouth, slender and drooped shoulders, and from what I could see before I absolutely pissed myself, a hand reaching out to me. It kept groaning.

I screamed for my mother. The more I screamed, the louder the groaning got. It was like this thing didn't want me to be heard. It wanted me. 
Now, I don't know where I got the strength, but I managed to practically dive out of my bed, while swinging the door open at the same time. Nobody was awake. My mom slept on the room across from mine so I jumped across the hallway and into her room. My mother immediately shot up and turned on the light. I slammed my back against the bedroom door, preparing myself to have to keep it closed. I could've sworn that thing would chase me, but it never did. Nothing happened. 

Quiet.

My mother knew something was up, and I have a feeling she already knew, but like I said, there was nothing we could do.I asked if she heard me at all and she shook her head. She instructed  me to lock the door, hide until daytime, and attempt to rest. We thought that thing would come out at any time. 
Nothing happened. 
Neither one of us slept that night.
I never went back in my bedroom alone or at night. 
Whatever that thing was, it was and still tied to that house, and has a personal fondness over my room.

I moved in with my then fiance (now husband), two weeks after my 18th. My parents followed suit about a year afterwards. 

I know my story telling skills aren't the best, and I'm sure a lot of this doesn't make sense, but trust me when I say, it happened and I will never step foot in that house ever again.
