Time has become a murky concept. I can’t tell if I have been in here for days, or even weeks. I just know I’m trapped, wandering this infinite maze of pale yellow walls, and that never-ending buzz from the lights above. It’s a low hum that gets under my skin, a sound I feel in my bones, like it’s trying to communicate with me.



The walls, those same yellow, faded walls stretch forever in every direction, broken only by doorways and corners to more identical rooms. Everything here looks wrong, like a warped memory of somewhere else. I try to remember what led me here, what I was doing before, but everything feels hazy, like my brain has been dipped in static.



My legs are sore, my throat is dry. The air is thick, carrying the sour smell of wet carpet, old and moldy, like the whole place is rotting from the inside. It’s suffocating, and I can taste the staleness with every breath.



Every so often, I hear something. It’s faint, sometimes like footsteps echoing down a hall, other times just a shuffling noise. But every time I pause to listen, it stops, leaving only the buzz of the lights and my own breathing. I’ve tried to tell myself it’s just my imagination, that I’m alone here. But the sounds are too real. They’re out there. Following me, lingering just on the other side of these walls.



And the worst part? I think I’m starting to recognize some of these rooms. They’re identical, but sometimes I’ll catch a stain on the carpet, a scratch on the wall. Little things that make me realize I’ve been here before. I try to keep track of my steps, marking walls with scratches of my own, but they disappear whenever I circle back. It’s like this place is alive, aware, shifting itself to keep me wandering.



Today, I found a door that was slightly open, different from all the others that lead only to more endless rooms. My pulse quickened as I pushed it open, only to find a larger room with flickering lights, a window, and shadows that didn’t seem to match up with the objects casting them. As I stepped inside, the buzzing intensified. Filling the air like a swarm of invisible bees. And then I heard it again, the faintest whisper, like someone calling my name from far away.



“Hello?” I called out, my voice sounding small and fragile. Silence. Then, a slow creak as the door behind me swung shut. My stomach dropped, and I spun around, but the room was empty. Just me and my own reflection in the dark, reflective glass of a window that shouldn’t have been there. I moved closer, peering into the glass, but all I saw was darkness, like staring into a deep void. And then, for just a second, something moved behind me in the reflection- a shadow, something tall and thin, just out of reach. I looked around, heart racing, but there was nothing.



The window was gone when I looked back. I’m not sure if I imagined it. I’m not sure of anything anymore.



I kept moving, trying to shake off the feeling that I wasn’t alone. But the sounds grew louder, closer. Sometimes it’s a scurrying, like rats in the walls, or a soft scraping, like fingernails dragging along the yellow wallpaper. I tried to tell myself it’s all in my head, but there are moments when the sounds are so close I can feel my skin crawl.



Then, just a few hours ago- if that word even means anything here- I found something else: a crumpled stained piece of brittle paper wedged into a corner. There were words on it, barely even in any language, scrawled in messy handwriting: “Don’t stop moving. It watches.”



My stomach twisted as I read it, and for a moment, I felt as if the walls were closing in. I shoved the paper in my pocket and picked up the pace, feeling the weight of unseen eyes watching me, following me as I moved through the maze. I could almost feel its presence now, lurking in the periphery, just outside my line of sight.



I don’t know how long I kept walking after that. My feet throbbed with every step, my eyes heavy. I was tempted to stop, to rest, but those words echoed in my mind: "Don’t stop moving." So I kept going, turning corners, passing through doorways, hoping that somehow, some way, I’d find a way out.



Then I saw it: a figure at the end of the hall, standing perfectly still. It was tall, too tall, its limbs impossibly long, its skin pale against the yellow walls. My blood turned to ice as it tilted its head, as if studying me, deciding what to do next. I didn’t wait to find out. I turned and ran, not looking back, my heart pounding in my chest.



I’ve been running ever since, my lungs burning, the air thick with that moldy, sour scent. The buzzing of the lights is louder now, a cacophony of sound that drowns out everything else. I’m not sure how much longer I can keep this up, but I know one thing- I can’t stop. I can feel it getting closer, hear its footsteps, almost in sync with mine.



The walls seem narrower, the rooms more cramped, and every turn brings me to another identical space, trapping me deeper in this endless, yellow nightmare. There’s no escape, no end. Only me, the buzzing lights, the smell of decay, and the thing that follows, always just out of sight, waiting for me to stop.
