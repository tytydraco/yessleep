Rumours have been circulating in my hometown about a young girl who befriends teenagers with pools. She would become close to the family and then wait for the perfect moment to murder the entire family.  She is calculated and cold. She waits until the right moment when the family is close to the pool, using the pool and then she would kill the entire family pool side leaving a literal pool of blood.

It started off as a story passed on among the people of my town, stories they would tell their kids, conversations they would have at work, discussion they would have during casual visits and so it goes.

The description has changed noticeably over the last year when it all started.  Some would say it was a mere orphan child who No one knew that befriended the children at parks, others would say it was a grown woman who was hired as a nanny, some even said it was a ghost.  Who knows.

The description was similar; it was always someone short with long blond hair.  

They called her the poolside killer. 

I work in the electronic repair field. Basically, I fix air-conditioners, swimming pool pumps, electric motors, TVs. Pretty much anything electronic I can fix.   This means I get called often to go to someone's house to repair items.

There are a couple of families that see me more often as they like the service I provide so they always call me over the slightest repair job and I would go there and do it fast.

My whole world was rocked the day I was called to repair the electric fence of a family I am well familiar with; we had been working together for quite a few years now and they always called me to repair something.  We will call them the Oâ€™Neal family for sake of protecting their identity or what is left of it.

This was the same month where the folks in town had been stirred up and left talking among themselves about the legend of the poolside killer.  

I never really took this seriously, just like in all horror movies. No one thinks any of these things are real until it is too late.  They rationalise until they can tell themselves the perfect lie in order to avoid these realities.

I was repairing the fence that Wednesday afternoon. It was quite a long day, a difficult job for a change and it took me all day to repair that fence. I had to take the whole wiring apart and redo it.  The money was good, so I went with it.

The kids had come home from school, it was a boy who was in his early teens and a girl who was around the age of 8-10. Living with them in the house were Mrs O'Neal, she was in her 40's and Mr O'Neal was in his 50's.  The mother of Mrs O'Neal was staying with them in the granny flat. She was quite old at the time already.

To continue my story, the daughter brought home a new friend.  Surely you can see where this goes.  The friend was a little girl, she was blond and looked to be around the age of 10-12. 

The exact position I was at this moment was at the far end of the yard. The yard was sizeable, and I was at the far opposite end.   From where I was standing, repairing the corner of the fence, I could see right across the yard to where the pool was located.  

The pool was right outside a sliding door located at the back part of the house. The 2 openings were on the back corner where the gate is to the outside and the entrance from the sliding door.  I could see through the gate from where I was working.

Another very true thing I didn't realise about horror movies is how we freeze up due to fear and can't look away or move.  Despite what anyone could rationalise while not having been a witness.

I saw them all come out, seems like they wanted to have a swim.  So, the entire family other than the granny was outside. They were taking pictures and getting ready to swim.  I saw the friend stand closest to Mr O'Neal at the time and everything moved in slow motion after I noticed the small blade in her hand that she was hiding from everyone.  I flinched as she repeatedly stabbed Mr O'Neal. I could almost feel the pain of her slicing Him. Her cutting is so fast. It happened so quick that No one knew what to do until it was too late.    I must have blacked out a large portion of the event as the moment I remember I heard Mrs O'Neal screaming and running toward me.

I saw the little girl. Her eyes locked with mine, blood on her face. She started moving towards us.  

Mrs O'Neal ran and so did I.

The little girl followed.

Mrs O'Neal found a place to hide in the house while the little girl seemed intent on hurting me. She followed me.

After seeing what she did to the others I didn't want to underestimate her and believe that I could just go and retrain her. No thank you, I want to live.   So, I ran.

I don't know why I didn't just leave the yard. I assume it's because I really didn't want Mrs O'Neal to be murdered too. That's so hazy.

I ran to the other side of the house and jumped over the fence to hide in the little courtyard they had.  I had just thought I outran her when I turned around and she was right behind me.  

Everything went black.

I woke up in the hospital 72 hours later, confused and in pain. Apparently, I had barely made it alive.    The little girl who had killed everyone hadn't known about the granny who was peacefully napping in the pool house.  She heard the screams, called the police and was intercepted tight before mutilating me.
