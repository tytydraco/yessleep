***Behind the reflection: study attempt 1.***









*My name is Dr. Octavia Norell.*

*I was commissioned by the United States government from Harvard’s science department to investigate a newly emerging anomaly—one that has already raised quiet alarms across scientific and academic communities.*

*For decades, we believed we understood mirrors. They reflect light, nothing more. A simple surface of glass and silver bounces back the world that stands before them. But lately… that assumption has begun to falter.*

*A growing number of disappearances have been linked, oddly, to mirrors—specifically, to the idea of what lies behind the reflection. Not behind the glass. It's not mounted on the wood or wall. But something else.*

*Something that doesn’t reflect.*

*And that’s where I come in.*

*I’ve been hired to study this anomaly, to determine whether it's possible to look past the reflection—to see beyond what light allows.*

*After the lab was secured, the team arrived.*

*Scientists from across the country—some from the nation’s top universities, others from deep-black government divisions I wasn’t allowed to ask about—were brought together for this unprecedented investigation. It was the largest collaborative experiment I’d ever seen, and certainly the strangest.*

*Before us stood hundreds of mirrors. Every shape and size. Tall, wide, round, antique, modern. It's all perfectly clean. It's all perfectly still.*

*The government advisor assigned to monitor our progress—an emotionless man in a pressed gray suit—insisted we use many mirrors. "In case of breakage," he said flatly. "Safety protocol."*

*But the way he said it…*

*It wasn't a precaution.*

*It was an expectation.* 

*Nevertheless, we got to work.*

*I was assigned to collaborate with three other lead researchers, each pulled from a different Ivy League institution. Dr. Andrew Hubert is a quiet but brilliant physicist from Harvard. Dr. Abigail Wingswirth, a sharp-witted chemist from Stanford. And Dr. Henry Brooks, Columbia’s foremost expert in astrophysics and anomalous spatial behavior.*

*We spent the first day exchanging theories—quantum displacement, dimensional overlays, and light folding. None of us could agree, but we all were equally eager to start.*

*Once the formalities ended, we began testing.*

*Hour after hour, we stared into the glass. We angled high-resolution cameras at each surface, documenting every flicker, every reflection, and every anomaly that might occur when we blinked or looked away.*

*And still—nothing.*

*No movement. No distortion. No sign that we were any closer to understanding what, if anything, existed beyond.*

*All data returned inconclusive. But the longer we stared into the mirrors, the harder it became to shake the feeling that something was waiting.*

*One night, I stayed behind in the lab.*

*I was alone, slouched in a chair with an apple in hand, staring blankly into one of the central mirrors. The others—Hubert, Wingswirth, and Brooks—were out on their thirty-minute lunch break. I hadn’t felt like eating. I was too frustrated.*

*I had tried everything.*

*I’d shined lights of every spectrum into the mirrors, even lasers calibrated to penetrate reflective surfaces. I’d written across the glass with ultraviolet ink, hoping something unseen might respond. I’d thrown rubber balls at the mirrors, studying the impact and rebound, listening for any delay, any distortion.*

*Nothing.*

*I’d even begun experimenting with photonic layering—trying to fracture the mirror’s reflective property and see what might be hiding beneath it. Still, nothing.*

*So I sat. Thinking. Chewing. Staring.*

*And then I saw it.*

*A face.*

*It was there for barely a second—ashen gray, thin, almost human. It pressed close to the other side of the mirror, so close that the reflective light warped slightly around its hollow eyes.*

*It looked at me.*

*And then, as fast as it had come, it recoiled—disappearing back into whatever darkness it had emerged from.*

*My chair clattered to the floor as I shot to my feet, the half-eaten apple rolling across the lab tiles. I stood there in frozen disbelief, eyes darting between the mirror and the nearest camera.*

*“Please let them be on. Please tell me we caught it.”*

*And to my absolute luck... we did.*

*Meanwhile, an emergency broadcast interrupted every major television network in the country—cutting through cartoons, news reports, and even satellite channels.*

*The screen flickered, then settled on the image of President George Anderfield standing behind a polished oak podium, flanked by flags. His face was pale. The usual rehearsed confidence was gone, replaced with something raw. Tired.*

*He looked directly into the camera.*

*“This message is being delivered under executive emergency powers,” he began, his voice steady but visibly strained. “Over the past ten years, individuals across the United States have vanished under circumstances that defy conventional explanation. Only a handful have been recovered.”*

*He paused.*

*“It is under this authority that I am issuing Executive Order 738-B. Effective immediately, all citizens are instructed to locate and destroy all mirrors within their homes.”*

*A murmur rippled through the press pool, but he kept speaking.*

*“I want to be clear,” he said, his voice sharpening, “there is nothing supernatural about this. These are precautionary measures. Public safety is our highest priority.”*

*And then, without further elaboration, the feed cut to black. A few seconds after the broadcast cut off, the screen flickered again—this time turning a deep, unsettling navy blue. White text appeared, stark and cold, before it dissolved into a robotic voice, flat and mechanical, yet somehow more unnerving than any human could be.*

*“Police have been granted full authority to search residences suspected of containing mirrors. Officers are authorized to arrest or, if necessary, use lethal force against individuals who resist the forfeiture of their mirrors.”*

*The words hung in the air like a thick fog.*

*“For those who wish to comply with the Executive Order, we recommend you destroy your mirrors in your front yard. A police cruiser will come to collect them and remove the remnants.”*

*The voice repeated itself, over and over, for weeks—its cold, robotic message looping relentlessly, as the timer dictated.*

*Officer Marcus Hale stared at his television, his eyes fixed on the screen in a state of disbelief. It wasn’t the broadcast itself that shocked him—it was the very necessity of it. He had been part of the task force that helped draft the warning, working with lawyers to ensure every legal detail was covered. He knew the words by heart, but he couldn’t grasp the reality behind them.*

*“Why had it come to this?” he said aloud.*

*Not out of rebellion. Not out of defiance. But a deep, unsettling lack of understanding.*

*He had enforced laws. He had investigated crimes. But this... this felt different. The very concept of policing mirrors—of raiding homes, of issuing death threats for glass—was a nightmare he couldn’t reconcile with the life he knew.*

*He shook his head, feeling the cold weight of his confusion pressing in.*

*I showed the camera footage to my peers, and the reaction was unanimous: disbelief.*

*We replayed the footage—again and again, scrutinizing every detail. Dr. Henry Brooks paced in front of us, laser pointer in hand, a paused image of the face projected onto the wall.*

*“This being has distinct human traits,” he said, voice tense with a mixture of excitement and unease. “I’ve consulted with biologists, and they’re all in agreement—the skull structure is so remarkably human, they’d be surprised if it’s anything else.”*

*Dr. Andrew Hubert, ever the skeptic, interjected with a frown. “If it’s human, then how did it get there? What are its rights? Is it even intelligent like us? Will it respect life the way we do?”*

*Henry glanced at him, his response quick and sharp. “Depends on whether you believe in evolution or God, Andrew. Those humans probably ended up there the same way we did. As for rights, well, let the lawyers figure that one out. Our job is to figure out if it’s capable of morals if it even cares about life.”*

*Dr. Abigail stood off to the side, her face a mask of confusion. She didn’t speak, didn’t ask any questions—just quietly observed. I couldn’t understand why she remained silent, but in a way, I didn’t have time to focus on that. At least now, we had something concrete to work with.*

*“What if we tried communicating with it?” I blurted out, the words slipping from my mouth before I had time to think them through.*

*The room went quiet. Confused looks passed between the others, until finally, Dr. Henry Brooks broke the silence.*

*“And how exactly do you plan to do that?” he asked, slowly, carefully—like he was already running through the risks in his head.*

*I stood up straighter, feeling the weight of my idea as I spoke. “What if we wrote something on the mirror? Or better yet, wrote a message on cardboard and taped it to the glass. Something clear. Direct. And make sure we say we want a response.”*

*They exchanged glances, waiting for someone—anyone—to object. No one did.*

*Henry gave a small nod. “Sounds like a plan. You get started. I’ll call the government advisor.”*

*Without wasting another second, I got to work. I scrawled the message across every mirror in the lab. I even grabbed cardboard sheets, wrote the same message in thick black marker, and taped them inward—facing the glass—so whatever was on the other side would see them.*

*Each sign read something along the lines of:*

***“We saw you poke your head out. If you can communicate, please write something in the mirror. We have questions.”***

*And then we waited.*

*I was beginning to feel like an idiot. What if this thing didn’t even understand English? What if it couldn’t read? My plan suddenly felt naive, childish even.*

*But my spiral of doubt was cut short by the sound of footsteps—and then a voice.*

*The director had arrived, flanked by my three colleagues. He walked in like he owned the air in the room, his tone laced with that signature condescension that only a man in a government-issued suit could perfect.*

*“Please, do show me this video,” he said, waving one hand dramatically. “I'm very interested in your progress so far.”*

*Before I could even respond, a sharp* ***BANG*** *rang out.*

*Everyone froze. We whipped around toward the source of the sound: one of the mirrors, its surface obscured by a taped-on cardboard message.*

*Something had just hit it. Hard.*

*I ran to the mirror, heart pounding, and tore the cardboard away.*

*Behind the glass stood a man.* 

*I—Officer Marcus Hale—stepped out of my cruiser and made my way toward the crime scene.*

*The mirror destruction order had only been in effect for a week. Roughly half the mirrors in America were already gone. You know how it goes—when one political party praises the president, the other tears him down. Half the country devoted itself to smashing every mirror they could find; the other half clung to theirs like sacred artifacts. The result? A perfectly balanced mess.*

*This time, I was here on a wellness check. The guy hadn’t shown up to work in a week. At first, his coworkers figured he was sick. But then they realized he hadn’t called in—not for sick leave, not for vacation. Nothing. Just silence.*

*So they sent me.*

*I knocked on the door and called out, “Police! Wellness check!” No answer.*

*I tried the handle. To my surprise, it wasn’t locked.*

*Inside, the air was still. Too still. The kind of stillness that tells you something’s wrong before your eyes ever confirm it. I moved slowly, scanning for any signs of life—or death.*

*Then I found the bedroom.*

*The carpet had been clawed up. Long, desperate gashes tore through the floorboards underneath, like someone had tried to crawl away. Fight or flight—but mostly flight. I scanned the room, hoping to find a window open, a back door ajar. Something.*

*But there was only one clue.*

*A shattered mirror on the bedroom table.*

*My stomach dropped.*

*I backed out, heart thudding, and called it in. This was beyond me. I needed one of the detectives here. Now.*

*Fifteen minutes later, the rest of the unit pulled up—three detectives in tow, gear bags slung over their shoulders, and that familiar, grim look in their eyes.*

*They’d seen this before.* 

*There had been hundreds of missing person reports—each one more baffling than the last. The only common clue?*

*A shattered mirror.*

*Sometimes it was in a bedroom, other times a bathroom, an office, or a prison cell. Children vanished from their cribs, and the only thing left behind was broken glass. Adults disappeared from their homes, workplaces, and even locked facilities where escape should’ve been impossible.*

*There were always signs of a struggle—scratched floors, overturned furniture, fingernail marks dug into the walls—but never any witnesses. No sounds, no alarms, no forced entries.*

*Just broken mirrors.*

*They weren’t just being taken. They were being stolen—from the very places they thought were safest.*

*And whatever was doing the taking… never left a trace.*

*I, Dr. Octavia Norell, stared in disbelief at the man behind the mirror. My colleagues stood frozen beside me, and even the government administrator was visibly rattled. None of us could comprehend who—or what—was standing on the other side.*

*But within seconds, the administrator was already calling in security.*

*I stepped closer to the mirror, ignoring the tension behind me, and held up a sheet of paper with a question written in thick black marker:* ***“How did you get in there?”***

*The man locked eyes with me. He didn’t speak—he simply stared. Then, without a word, he stepped to the side and pulled out a plank of wood, holding it up to the glass. Written in charcoal were the words:*

***“I was taken. If you break the mirror, you will let me out.”***

*I blinked hard, rereading it over and over again. It seemed too simple—too surreal to be real. But something about his eyes… it felt true.*

*Security burst into the lab, guns ready, and the administrator began hastily explaining what was happening. But I didn’t wait. I dashed across the room, grabbed a hammer from the toolbox, and charged toward the mirror.*

*One of the security officers shouted, assuming I was trying to attack the man or destroy evidence, but I didn’t stop.*

*I smashed the glass with a single blow.*

*The man immediately thrust his hands through the fractured surface. I grabbed them and pulled, and as soon as he crossed over, the mirror sealed itself. No longer a gateway—just the back of a wooden frame.*

*But I had seen what lay behind it.*

*The world within that mirror was a place unlike any we had ever imagined. Towering ash-gray trees—at least forty feet high—stood five feet apart in eerily perfect spacing. Their trunks were strong like normal trees, yet made entirely of ash, holding form in complete defiance of nature.*

*The forest floor was blanketed in a fine layer of dry white ash, like snow that would never melt.*

*In the distance stood vast black cities—towering skyscrapers and monolithic office buildings reaching into the sky. The world repeated itself endlessly: forest, city, forest, city… a surreal checkerboard of desolation and artificial order.*

*But the worst part—the part that chilled me to my core—was the light.*

*Where there should have been darkness, there was light. And where light should have reigned, there was only darkness. The sun in that world shone down in shafts of* ***darkness****, casting deep shadows. But when those shadows hit buildings,* ***they burst into radiant light*** *on the other side.*

*And all across the landscape,* ***mirrors*** *hung like lanterns—floating, standing, shattered, intact—scattering light like spotlights, like little screaming windows showing everything you weren't meant to see.*

*Every single mirror in our world led somewhere in that world.*

*Security quickly restrained the man—filthy, shaking, and whispering things we couldn’t yet hear—and took him to a secure interrogation room. My colleagues and I followed close behind, ready to ask the only question that mattered:*

***What is the world behind the glass?***

*After what felt like forever, I was finally allowed to interview him.*

*In the meantime, psychologists and biologists had been running test after test, trying to determine just how human he was. They even brought in FBI agents to identify his nationality and trace any possible criminal background.*

*His name was* ***Alan B. Parker****—a 23-year-old American citizen who had been reported missing* ***five days ago****.*

*But that wasn’t the creepy part.*

*He scored* ***off the charts*** *on both the Dark Triad and psychopathy assessments. Psychologists ran the tests over two days, triple-checking their results. They were baffled. This guy made the darkest minds they’d ever studied look like mild-mannered introverts.*

*Then came the biological analysis.*

*Every single* ***muscle*** *in his body was unbelievably dense. Not just toned or athletic—****dense****, like forged metal under the skin. One biologist even mentioned a study I’d read before, about how if our other muscles were as dense as our tongue, we’d be able to jump over power lines and tear grizzly bears in half.*

*One of the lead biologists looked me straight in the eye and said:*

***“His weakest muscle is three times denser than anything found in the human—or animal—body.”***

*I couldn’t wait any longer. The moment he was cleared for the interview I rushed to the interrogation room with a notepad and pencil, ready to record every word, every twitch, every thought that might slip out of him.*

*But when I walked into the observation chamber and saw the setup, I froze.*

*Alan B. Parker sat in a steel chair, though sat is a generous word. He was chained to it—so many links wrapped around him that I could barely make out his body. Each limb had* ***three pairs of reinforced handcuffs*** *locking it in place. The chair itself was bolted to the floor with industrial-grade anchors.*

*We were separated by* ***bulletproof glass****.*

*There were* ***ten guards*** *on his side of the room, all with guns trained on him, fingers hovering over triggers. Another* ***ten guards*** *stood behind me, prepared to evacuate me at the first sign of danger.*

*I turned to the head of security, stunned.*

*“I thought you said he was cleared for safety?” I asked.*

*The captain glanced at me, smirked faintly, and muttered as he walked away,*

***“He is now.”*** 

*I shook off the unsettling feeling that still lingered from the moment I walked in. There were too many guards, too many chains—but I had a job to do. I cleared my throat, steadied my hand on the pencil, and began the interview.*

***Dr. Octavia:*** *“Hello, Alan. Are you ready to answer some questions for me?”*

*He stared at me for a long while, unblinking. Then, finally, he nodded once.*

***Dr. Octavia:*** *“Good. So… what is the world like behind the mirror?”*

***The Patient:*** *“Cold. Extremely cold.”*

*I blinked. He just said it like that—flat and simple. No detail, no context. Just the temperature. I gave him a puzzled look.*

***Dr. Octavia:*** *“Can you elaborate further?”*

*He didn’t hesitate this time.*

***The Patient:*** *“You know. Cold—like the concentration camps in Nazi Germany. Like the Gulag in Soviet Russia. Like American prisons. And best of all… like Hell.”*

*That gave me pause. I tilted my head, uncertain whether he was still talking about the literal cold. But before I could press him further, he continued.*

***The Patient:*** *“It’s the kind of place so far from God… and so filled with human and otherworldly evil… that you feel morally cold. Like the warmth of your soul has been stripped away.”*

*I wrote that down word for word. I wasn’t sure what it meant exactly, but I knew it mattered. Everything about him did.*

***Dr. Octavia:*** *“Did you… deserve to go to the Mirror World?”*

***The Patient:*** *“No. It just happened. I don’t think I deserved it.”*

***Dr. Octavia:*** *“How long were you in that world?”*

***The Patient:*** *“Five hundred years.”*

*I stared at him. Not in shock—more like disbelief. My first thought? He’s lying. The police report said he’d only been missing for five days. He couldn’t have possibly spent half a millennium behind that mirror.*

*I raised an eyebrow, clearly skeptical.*

*But Alan saw right through me.*

***The Patient:*** *“If you don’t believe me, that’s fine. After about 120 years there, I learned to take pride in self-security. I don’t need to prove anything to anyone… especially now that I’m finally out.”*

*He leaned back slightly against the mass of chains like he didn’t care anymore. And maybe he didn’t.*

*I watched him, still confused. But before I could ask anything else, a guard tapped me on the shoulder. My time was up.*

*I stood and handed my seat over to* ***Dr. Abigail Wingsworth****, a colleague who specialized in psychological trauma. As she walked in, clipboard in hand, I stepped out—my mind still spinning.*

*Five days here.*

*Five hundred years there.*

*It didn’t make any sense.*

*But I knew what I had to do next.*

***I needed to find out if time moved differently behind the mirror.***

*After my first interview with Alan, I couldn’t stop thinking about what he said—five hundred years in a world where mirrors became doorways and sunlight rained darkness. I had to know more. So I got to work.*

*I built a camera.*

*Not a regular one—this one was custom, rigged with experimental tech, and reinforced to withstand extreme temperatures, just in case that strange world was as cold as he said. My plan was simple: figure out a way to slip the camera through the mirror without breaking it entirely. I wanted to open a portal just wide enough.*

*But it didn’t work.*

*No matter what I tried, the mirror refused to open again. It sat there—silent, reflective, and sealed. Hours passed. I kept adjusting the frame, tweaking the lens, and running calculations, but nothing happened. It was just a mirror now.*

*That’s when Abigail came back.*

*She walked into the lab with a hollow look in her eyes. Pale. Shaken. She didn’t say a word at first. Just sat down at one of the workbenches, hands trembling slightly.*

*Concerned, I walked over and asked gently, “What’s wrong?”*

*She didn’t meet my eyes. Her voice was barely above a whisper.*

***“He’s insane.”***

*Before I could press further, she opened up like a floodgate—words spilling out faster than I could process.*

***“He shows signs of being a serial killer—but with even less empathy. Less care. Do you know how serial killers usually sort people into ‘those I like’ and ‘those I don’t’? Well… he doesn’t like anyone. Not his wife. Not his children. He claims he’s forgotten who they were. He doesn’t see people as people anymore—just as threats. Or meals.”***

*I stared at her. Frozen. That couldn’t be real.*

*But Abigail wasn’t the type to exaggerate. She was one of the most grounded scientists I knew—methodical, logical, and deeply ethical. If she said something disturbed her, I trusted it.*

*Still… I had to hear it from him myself.*

*I immediately applied to interview Alan again. Whatever he was—whatever that world had turned him into—I needed to see it with my own eyes.*

*And when I finally did?*

*I realized something terrifying.*

***Abigail had understated his condition.***

*They had moved him out of the interrogation room.*

*It was too expensive to keep chaining him down and posting a small army around him. So now, Alan was kept in a reinforced steel observation box—windowed, monitored by cameras, and fitted with a two-way microphone. From a financial standpoint, it made sense. From a safety standpoint… I wasn’t so sure.*

*I sat down across from the box and adjusted my notepad. The microphone was now a toggle button instead of a push-to-hold, and I made a mental note to be careful with it.*

*I began asking him questions—more or less repeating what Abigail had already gone over. I wanted to see for myself how his mind worked. How he thought. And honestly, for the most part, he repeated everything she said he would. The same cold, deadpan detachment from humanity. The same twisted view of others as threats or potential meals.*

*I should’ve stopped there.*

*But I didn’t.*

*At one point, forgetting the mic was still on, I leaned back and whispered—barely audible—****“How did you become like this?”***

*He heard it.*

*Immediately, Alan burst into laughter. And not just any laugh—it was shrill and broken, rising unnaturally in pitch like glass cracking under pressure. The only thing I can compare it to is Kira’s laughter from Death Note—that moment of absolute delusion, when reality folds in on itself and the madness spills out.*

*His eyes locked onto mine, wide and glinting like shards of a mirror. A slow, maniacal smile crawled across his face, revealing teeth that weren’t animalistic, but sharpened—filed down like some prison project born of boredom and rage.*

*Then he spoke.*

*His voice was strangled with insanity, trembling with delight.*

***“Five hundred years… of eating my friends.***

***Five hundred years of building civilizations, watching them burn, watching them tear each other apart.***

***Five hundred years of monsters. Five hundred years of being exploited—and exploiting others.***

***Of rage. Brute force. Malice. Abandonment.***

***Of forgetting everything I ever cared about.***

***Five hundred years to learn how to enjoy the evil I was doing.”***

*He stood in the center of the steel box, motionless—shoulders square, back straight, head tilted sharply to the right until it nearly touched his shoulder. It looked like a pose like he was performing for me. Like he enjoyed recounting it.*

*Behind me, one of the psychologists—who had been silently observing the exchange—breathed out softly, more to themselves than to me, but just loud enough for me to hear.*

***“Five hundred years of mental damage.”***

*And they were right.*

*I wasn’t talking to a human anymore. I was talking to what was left of one.*

*It was when I finally accepted the theory that for every day that passes on Earth, 100 years pass in that world.*



*We finally found one.*

*After months of failure and false alarms, the police force had finally recovered a missing person—alive, conscious, and seemingly unharmed. I, Officer Marcus Hale, was part of the patrol that found him.*

*He was walking along the side of the road just outside the city limits. Pale as death. His skin was stained in strange patterns—gray, almost like burn marks, but with a texture closer to ash. The way he moved was odd too—graceful, but disconnected. Like his body was floating just slightly out of sync with the world around him.*

*We pulled over immediately. He didn’t resist. Just stared at us as we approached, his eyes cloudy but calm, as if he had expected this moment.*

*Back at the department, paramedics gave him a full check-up. We contacted his family. It felt like a win. Something clean. Something good.*

*Detective Isaac Gutenberg was assigned to his case. It only made sense he’d be the one to speak to the victim first. You’ve got to understand something about Isaac—he was one of the best. Somehow, he could just look at a person and know. He didn’t always explain it, but time and time again, he called it right. Almost like he could peer into a person’s soul.*

*But the moment he walked into that room, everything changed.*

*He froze in the doorway. Just stared at the man sitting across the table.*

*Then, after what felt like a full minute of silence, he forced a polite smile and said,* ***“You’ve been missing for quite a while now. Caused quite the project looking for you. Where have you been hiding for twenty years?”***

*The man didn’t answer.*

*He just leaned back in his chair, stared up at the ceiling, and whispered to himself—*

***“Huh.”***

*That was it. That one word. That one reaction.*

*It shattered whatever calm Isaac had been holding onto.*

*He spun around, walked out of the room, and pulled the rest of us into the hallway like we were about to conduct a raid. Tension boiled off him in waves.*

*I glared at Detective Isaac, expecting an answer—something—after he’d abruptly pulled us all from the room. He spun around, locked eyes with me, and said, “Shouldn’t he be older?”*

*I frowned, thrown off by the question.*

*He continued, more agitated now. “He went missing twenty years ago. According to his police file, he should be forty-five years old.”*

*I paused, suddenly unsure. We never really had the clearance to dig too deep into old case files—that’s part of a mandate instituted way back in 3021. Something about preserving the objectivity of street-level officers. So I hadn’t seen the victim’s original age.*

*“But look at him,” Isaac pressed, pointing back toward the room. “He’s no older than twenty-three. I guarantee it.”*

*I glanced at the others. Silent glances passed between us—shrugs, raised brows, half-smirks. Maybe Isaac was slipping. It wouldn’t be impossible. He took on more stress than anyone else on the force. Saw more twisted stuff in a year than most of us saw in a lifetime. Maybe he just mixed up two different missing persons cases. Maybe he was just… tired.*

*That’s when the door opened behind us—and she walked in.*

*The victim's wife.*

*Isaac straightened, tense as a coiled spring. “No one moves,” he said quickly. “Just watch. Let’s see how this plays out.”*

*We crowded around the one-way mirror in silence as she stepped into the room, face stiff with skepticism. She looked at the man—her husband, supposedly—and froze.*

*Her expression said it all.*

*She didn’t recognize him. Not the way a wife should.*

*And God help me, he looked younger than her.*

*Way younger.* 

*According to her ID, she was forty-three. And if Detective Isaac was right—if he hadn’t completely lost his mind—then the man sitting in that room should’ve been forty-five.*

*She stepped closer, hesitating. You could see the disbelief on her face, the years catching up with her all at once.*

*Then, cautiously, she spoke.*

*“Thomas? Is that you?”*

*He smiled. A soft, almost nostalgic smile.*

*“Yeah,” he said. “Funny... I haven’t heard anyone say my name without rage or hatred in—”*

*He stopped mid-sentence.*

*And for just a second, I swear to God, he looked directly through the one-way mirror. Not just in our direction—at Detective Isaac. Like he knew exactly where we were standing.*

*Then he turned back to his wife, that odd smile still lingering.*

*“—Twenty years?” he finished, like he was trying to pass a test he hadn’t studied for.*

*His wife blinked back tears. “Either way, it’s been too long. Where have you been?”*

*He opened his mouth to answer.*

*But before a single word could leave his lips, the door behind us burst open.*

*Men in suits—serious, silent, and completely out of place—marched into the hallway and ordered us away from the mirror.*

*Whatever was about to be said… we weren’t meant to hear it. The men in suits didn’t wait. They stormed into the interrogation room with urgency, reaching for handcuffs like this man—this missing person we’d just found—was some kind of threat.*

*But before they could lay a hand on him, his lawyer burst through the door like a tidal wave.*

*I’d called her the moment we brought him in, just following protocol. She wasted no time. In an instant, she was in their faces, slamming down documents, shoving legal jargon down their throats with the kind of fury only a real defense attorney could conjure.*

*What followed was a chaotic blur of shouting, papers, threats, and phone calls. But in the end, the suits backed down. They couldn’t take him. Not yet.*

*And just like that, the man was free to go.*

*He left with his wife.*

*Turns out, she had never moved on. Never remarried. Twenty years missing, and she’d waited.*

*It should have been a happy ending. A miracle, even.*

*But as I stood in the empty hallway, watching them walk out of the station together, hand in hand like no time had passed at all…*

*I couldn’t shake this feeling.*

*Like I’d made a terrible mistake.*

*Like I had just helped something go home that should’ve never been allowed to leave.*

*It wasn’t two days later when everything fell apart.*

*Thomas—if that’s even who he still was—was apprehended for mass murder.*

*The details were grotesque. He had cannibalized three children, two men, and one woman. And when his wife tried to stop him from eating people, he assaulted her. His strength, unnatural and terrifying, was enough to kill 100 police officers who tried to restrain him. In the courtroom, he pleaded innocence, but not because he was insane—no, he wasn’t hiding behind that excuse. He said simply, with chilling clarity, that he was hungry.*

*The court was stunned, the jury horrified, but it didn’t end there. He was sent straight to a maximum-security prison. A place where the most dangerous criminals are kept. But even there, he wasn’t contained.*

*Every guard who tried to manhandle him was ripped apart. Every prisoner who looked at him wrong was torn to pieces. And any human unlucky enough to come too close? They didn’t stand a chance.*

*Then came the riot.*

*He broke free from his cell, like an animal unleashed. He tore through the prison with ruthless efficiency—punching through chests, ripping out organs, and feasting on his victims with a horrifying calm and a sickening enjoyment. His actions were so brutal, so swift, that even the most hardened criminals recoiled in fear.*

*The Army was called in to subdue him.*

*But they were baffled. They could only watch as he sat on a throne made of corpses, his arms outstretched like a conqueror, a twisted god. He mocked them, his voice steady, filled with a kind of venomous amusement.*

*“Back behind the Reflection,” he said, his eyes gleaming with something far older than any human normal should possess, “they worshiped me as a god for my age. For I was old— even for their eternal standards.” He paused, a twisted smile curling on his lips as he glared at the soldiers. “But now… you will treat me like some weak teenager who isn’t to be taken seriously.”*

*The video of that moment, the chilling scene of him surrounded by his victims, was leaked to the public. The soldiers who fought him? They were all killed in seconds. Their weapons could do nothing to his skin, and their armor could not protect them from his strength.* 

*The only way the authorities managed to contain him was by constructing a massive dome over the prison—a dome made of pure titanium. No one could get in, and no one could get out. It wasn’t a solution; it was a cage.*

*But that didn’t stop the whispers.*

*The government’s handling of the crisis was a disaster. Everyone, from the low-level police officers to the average civilians, began to look at their leaders with skepticism, and distrust. Everyone started questioning what they had been told, what they had been kept in the dark about.*

*Lawyers were hired by the dozen. They combed through every government document they could get their hands on, searching for anything that could explain how this man—this monster—had been allowed to slip through the cracks. But what they found was even worse.*

*No one knew the full truth. No one understood who Thomas was—or what he had become.*

*But everyone knew one thing for sure: something hides behind the reflection.*  
*end of part one.*
