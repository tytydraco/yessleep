Nickelodeon has some great shows but we can all agree that SpongeBob is the one that made Nickelodeon what it is. Most of you probably know that the show was supposed to end way before. To be exact. The first movie was supposed to be the ending of the series. But Nickeloden never wanted to let go of it. That however didn't stop Nickelodeon from creating a canonically true ending. And I promise y'all have already seen it before. But before we get to that I should introduce myself. I work as a security guard for Nickelodeon. There have been people stealing episodes to leak them before they get officially released. To prevent this we security guards exist. 

We also sometimes have to guard in the presentation room where episodes are being presented to the team to check out if everythings right with the episodes. We have to guard there because especially with a lot of people in the room some people might try to record and pirate the episodes. Also stuff that happened before. That also gives me the opportunity to watch new episodes together with the animators before they eventually get released. This is also how I found out about this one.

  
The episode: "The Sponge That Could Fly" was marketed as a "lost episode" at the time and I didn't understand why, especially since the episode was more or less a completely normal episode. For a long time I didn't know that this was an attempt to cover up a real lost episode. The plan was that people who wanted to know about this episode and searched for it would only come across "The Sponge That Could Fly" instead of search results for the real lost episode. A quite smart idea. This would keep it a secret even if the episode got leaked.

A colleague friend of mine, who also works as an animator, told me about the episode and I was curious. He said he wanted to meet me in the presentation room after the shift. When the shift was over, I was excited to find out what this is all about. When I entered the room, he seemed a little nervous and asked if anyone was following me. I assured him that I was alone and he started talking: 



"Ok, we once animated an episode that you probably know as "Spongehenge". I assume you've even seen it. And you know that the episode has a pretty dark ending. But did you know that this episode was supposed to be a Spongebob special and not only that. It was supposed to be a two-part episode. However, Nickelodeon decided not to air the second part of the episode because it would have been too disturbing for children. Believe me, even as an adult, this episode is disturbing. Nevertheless, I want people to know the truth. I stole the episode from the cassette room where it was stored under lock and key. You have to watch it."



And then the episode began. But before I tell you what happened, I need to briefly mention what the regular episode is about so that those who haven't seen it have some context. Spongehenge" is about a huge storm raging over Bikini Bottom because Neptune, the god of the seas, is angry. The resulting strong wind whistles through Spongebob's pores, creating a lovely sound that jellyfish like. The jellyfish start to chase Spongebob and won't leave him alone. 



Spongebob therefore flees from Bikini Bottom into a cave where he searches for a solution to the problem because the storm won't stop. However, he stays in this cave for an extremely long time. It is rumoured that he could have spent months if not years there. Finally, he comes up with the idea of building huge stone statues of himself that make such a majestic sound that the jellyfish leave Spongebob alone. In the end, Spongebob succeeds and returns to Bikini Bottom only to find the Krusty Krab submerged in the ground and he realises how long he has actually been gone. Spongebob then screams out his despair and the episode ends with a timeskip of thousands of years. 



In this timeskip, aliens come to Earth to investigate the statues built by Spongebob. This ends the episode. And that's the version we know. A pretty dark ending. Now lets get to this one. Because in the original the timeskip never happened. The first part of the episode ended with Spongebob screaming out his despair. And thats where the second part starts. 



The second part begins by cutting to the devastated interior of the Krusty Krab and all you can see from a distance is Spongebob digging his way to the main entrance and squeezing through the glass door. Everything is devastated and full of spider webs. He calls for Mr Krabs and enters his office. In the office he finds the skeletal remains of Mr Krabs' dead body. Spongebob starts crying again and reproaches himself that he might have been able to prevent this if he had been there. He squeezes his way back out of the main entrance and burrows his way back up and eventually begins to walk through Bikini Bottom, sobbing.



The whole town is devastated by the storm and there is no sign of life. He calls out to someone but no one answers. Spongebob is the only survivor. Eventually he returns to his pineapple, which is also completely covered in sand. However, he can enter it using the hatch on the roof. His entire house is in a similar state to the Krusty Krab and when he enters his bedroom he finds Gary's empty snail shell. He realises that Gary has not survived either and reproaches himself again. He says that if he had been there he could have fed Gary. He kneels in front of the empty snail shell and starts sobbing again. Such a melancholy scene is rather atypical for Spongebob.



He then digs a hole behind his house and buries the snail shell there. He then goes to Squidward and also enters his house using a hatch on the roof, as it is completely covered in sand. He finds Squidward's remains in the bed. Only the skeleton remains and a sea urchin crawls out of his eye. Spongebob says "Farewell" to Squidward and then takes his clarinet with him as a memento. Next he goes to Patrick, whose house is no longer even recognisable because it is buried under the mountain of sand. Only parts of the sign he had on the roof are still there. Spongebob digs down and finds Patrick's body on the armchair while the TV is still on. He starts crying again and begins to talk to Patrick's corpse. He says he's sorry and starts crying so hard that, in comedy style, the whole stone fills with tear water and Patricks body is washed away. Then there is a cut.



Next he makes his way to Sandy's dome. The dome is also buried in sand. However, the main entrance is still there and part of the dome is visible. There is a note on the door with a message for Spongebob. Apparently Sandy has survived. However, she explains that she has returned to the surface for her own safety. She says that she tried to find Spongebob to take him with her but he was nowhere to be found and by the time she found Patrick and Squidward it was too late for them.



Spongebob is glad that at least Sandy made it. But he is still desperate and sad. The episode ends with Spongebob returning to the stone statues he built earlier and seeing the jellyfish dancing around them. He clenches his hands into fists and says: "At least you're happy now, eh?" before turning round and walking off into the sunset, sobbing sadly.

  
Shortly afterwards, the credits are shown and while they are playing, devastated places can be seen in the background that Spongebob did not visit in the episode, but which nevertheless appeared in the series. These include Mrs Puff's boating school, the Chum Bucket and Glove World. All these places are destroyed and covered in sand.



When it was over, he explained to me that the original plan was to end Spongebob this way. But they changed their mind so that the series wouldn't have such a dark ending. I was admittedly a bit shocked when I saw this episode. All the characters you love are either dead or gone and the episode shows this. It's not unnecessarily brutal or gory but it's still disturbing. It's also far too serious for a children's series. There is no laughter, no values conveyed. Nothing like that. I wondered what the creators were thinking.



My friend said he wanted to put the episode on the Internet. I don't know if he will. But I understand him. I know the truth and I want you all to know it too.
