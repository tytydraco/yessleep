I was on my way to the grocery store, just like any other day. The sun was shining and the birds were singing, but my mind was racing. Racing with thoughts of anxiety and fear that had been haunting me for years. I had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the voices in my head were relentless. They told me to do things, things that I knew were wrong, but I couldn't resist.

As I approached the crosswalk, I saw the crossing guard standing there with her stop sign up, stopping the traffic for nothing. There was no one in sight, but she just stood there, staring at me. I felt a shiver down my spine as I drove closer to her, and the voices in my head grew louder. They told me to ignore her, to run through the crosswalk and continue on my way. And so I did.

I accelerated and drove straight through the crosswalk, ignoring the crossing guard and her stop sign. But as I passed through, I felt a jolt in my stomach, a feeling of something hitting my car. I looked in the rearview mirror and saw the crossing guard lying on the ground, along with a few other people.

I panicked and stopped the car, trying to make sense of what had just happened. The voices in my head were screaming at me, telling me to run away, to leave the scene of the accident. But I couldn't. I had to face the consequences of my actions.

As I got out of the car, I saw the people lying on the ground, injured and bleeding. The crossing guard was still unconscious, and the others were screaming in pain. I didn't know what to do. I was paralyzed with fear and guilt. I knew I had caused this, but I couldn't remember hitting anyone. It was as if my mind had blocked out the entire event.

The police and ambulance arrived on the scene, and I was taken away in handcuffs. I was charged with reckless driving and causing bodily harm to multiple people. My mental illness was taken into consideration, but it didn't excuse my actions.

I spent years in prison, haunted by the memories of that day. The voices in my head never stopped, and the guilt never faded. I had caused so much pain and suffering, all because I couldn't control my own mind.

Now, as I sit in my cell, I often think back to that crosswalk and the crossing guard who stopped the traffic for nothing. Maybe she knew something I didn't. Maybe there were people there, and my mental illness had blinded me to their presence. Or maybe it was all just a coincidence, a tragedy waiting to happen. But one thing is for certain, I will never forget that day, and the horror that followed.

You might be wondering -- if you are in a cell, how do you have a phone? Well, dead children always come with dead possessions.
