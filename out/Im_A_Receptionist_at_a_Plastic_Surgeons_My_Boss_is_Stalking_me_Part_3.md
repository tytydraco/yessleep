The lungs in my fridge were bad enough, but the thought of Dr. Harrison breaking into my house, going through my mail, and even possibly hurting Sonny caused me more anger than anything else. I walked over to my sink and grabbed the rubber gloves I wear while doing the dishes. After putting them on, I quickly grabbed a trash bag and returned to the fridge. 



I stared at the fridge door for a good long time. The only sound in my apartment was Sonny happily eating his food, completely oblivious to the horrible thing that his owner was going through. I really do envy him. Finally, after taking a deep breath and holding it in, I flung the fridge door open and quickly grabbed the lungs. A loud gag escaped from my throat as my hands made contact with the lungs. They were soft and spongy and felt like if I squeezed them too hard, they would burst like a disgusting, bloody balloon. I quickly shoved them into the trash bag and closed it as tightly as I possibly could. I then ran over to the sink and threw up again, quickly washing my gloves clean and leaving them out to dry. 



I left the bag in the kitchen, but had to move it up to the sink to stop Sonny from trying to rip open the bag and take a nibble out of the lungs. I wanted nothing more than to go back to the clinic and shove the lungs back into Dr. Harrison’s fake, beautiful face. But I needed to think rationally, and I needed to ensure that I didn’t just wind up angering him enough to the point where he’d want to inflict pain on me. So I sat down in my living room, with Sonny on my lap, and began to knit. There’s nothing better to calm me down, except, of course, something sweet. But the lungs sitting in my sink put me off from eating anything. 



The next day, I woke up even earlier than I usually did. That was because I wanted to get the bag of lungs into my car without having to explain anything to my nosy neighbors. They mean well and are such sweethearts, but I did not have the patience to be dealing with them that day. Lucky for me, they were still asleep when I loaded the bag into my trunk. I made sure to leave food for Sonny and water, and made sure that the door stayed locked. Double and triple checking. I didn’t know how Dr. Harrison had made it inside, but I wanted to make sure that it stayed locked and that Sonny didn’t find it open and wander off. 



I drove to the clinic and soon arrived at the time I would usually be waking up to leave. The sun was just rising on the horizon, and the birds were chirping their little hearts out. I contemplated whether I should just wait in my car until I was supposed to come in, but the thought of the bag ripping open and leaking in my trunk made me get out and decide to just enter the clinic. If nothing else, I could at least talk to Wilson until Dr. Harrison arrived. So I got out of my car, walked back over to my trunk, and grabbed the lungs. And doing my best not to throw up again, entered the clinic. 



However, when I entered, I was caught off guard to see that Wilson wasn’t standing where he usually did. I thought that maybe he was just in one of the offices, keeping himself entertained, but after some searching, I couldn’t find him at all. He’d just vanished. I walked over to the alarm for the building and saw that it hadn’t been tripped or anything, so to my confusion and a little sadness, I took my seat at my desk and waited. I placed the trash bag on the floor and kept my purse with me. I wasn’t going to risk the bread creature rummaging through my bag again. 



My eyes were glued to the door, waiting for someone to appear. Be it Dr. Harrison, Wilson even Rachel, I wanted someone to show up. As I waited, spinning my pen around my thumb, I started to hear the trash bag begin to rustle. I looked down at it, and to my horror, I saw that the bread creature had somehow ripped a hole in the bag and was starting to chew on the lungs inside. 



“Get off of that!” I shouted at it, instinctively trying to kick it away from the bag. It screeched at me with a mouth I could best describe as a crab mixed with a piranha's mouth. All of its different colored human eyes were looking around in various directions and I could tell that I pissed it off. I looked around for something to distract it with. I noticed a big binder clip that I used to keep a stack of files held together, and quickly grabbed it to show to the creature. It quickly stopped hissing at me, and I watched as all of its eyes stared at the paperclip, and the pupils dilated to giant sizes. “Go get it…thing!” I shouted at it before throwing the paperclip down the hall behind me. The speed at which the thing ran after it on its black noodle limbs astonished me, I could only compare it to a house centipede with how quickly it ran after the metal object. 



“Hopefully that keeps it entertained,” I sighed, leaning back in my chair and looking down at the trash bag. I kicked it away with my feet and stifled a gag as I watched blood slowly start to ooze out of the bite marks the creature had made. After what felt like an eternity, Dr. Harrison arrived. He looked over at me and quickly smiled excitedly. I didn’t return his smile. 



“Sir? Care to explain this?” I asked him, reaching down to grab the bag and placing it on the counter. He looked at the bag and seemed to be a little confused about what I was talking about. He closed the distance between us and opened up the bag, peering inside it. 



“Oh, that. You didn’t like it?” He looked at me with his big, stupid puppy dog eyes. I wanted so badly to smack him across the face, but I knew the violence was my last course of action. And it would likely only cause him to grow enraged with me. 



“James, why would I want a pair of lungs? Whose do these even belong to?” It was only then that I began to worry. Had Dr. Harrison hurt someone I knew? Had he hurt Phillip? I clenched my fists at my side and waited for an answer from him. I felt like a mother scolding her child, but after what Dr. Harrison had told me he’d done to his mother, I hoped I wouldn’t meet a similar fate. 



“Well…the roses and flowers weren’t doing it. So I thought…I dunno, maybe you’d like them?” He seemed so pathetic all of a sudden. He could’ve gotten me chocolates, stuffed animals, anything other than human organs. How fucked up was his mind that this would be his next logical step up? Then I thought back to everything I knew about him and everything he’d done up to that point. And was honestly surprised he didn’t start with giving me human organs. 



“Where did they come from, James?” I demanded to know, crossing my arms at him and narrowing my eyes at him. He looked at me with his sad green eyes and sighed. 



“It was just from a patient, Maggie. Don’t worry about it,” he said with an exasperated sigh. As if he were the one in the wrong here. 



“You broke into my house, read my mail, left me lungs in the fridge, and expect me not to be worried or upset by this, James?” I asked him, tapping my foot on the carpeted floor. He looked at me quizically before staring back at the floor, lost in thought about something. 



“If you keep doing these things to me, James. I swear to God I’m not only calling Mr. Sinclair, but I’m quitting for real this time. And no amount of money is going to keep me here.” I had reached my limit with him, and he stared at me with a mix of horror, shock, and sadness. 



“You can’t! We had a deal!” He reached out and grabbed me by the arms, digging his nails into my soft arms. I let out a scream and quickly kicked him in the shins to make him let go of me, which he quickly did. 



“Forget the deal!” I screamed at him, walking over to my reception area and heading towards the ancient rotary phone. James, after rubbing his bruised shin, looked up and quickly ran over to me. He grabbed me by the sweater neck and pulled me away from the phone. 



“Okay! I promise I’ll stop!” He pleaded, getting on his knees before me and staring up at me with a face that screamed desperation. I stared down at him and then over to the phone. Mr. Sinclair had a deep hold on Dr. Harrison, and I dreaded to find out just what he and his evil shadow were capable of. 



“You better keep your promise. Now, please get up, we’re opening soon, sir.” I pulled away from him and left him kneeling on the floor. After a few minutes, he pulled himself off the floor. He took the bag with him and disappeared into one of the consultation rooms. 



I lay back in my chair and let out a loud, shaky breath as my heart felt as if it was going to burst through my chest. That could’ve ended horribly for me if Dr. Harrison had lost his temper. I was lucky that, for whatever reason, he seemed so desperate to keep me around here. And that was most likely the only reason I was still alive after standing up to him. I reached a shaky hand over to a stack of papers and started trying to do some work. I didn’t get much done by the time Rachel walked into work, her face mask still firmly placed on her face. 



“Where’s the idiot?” She asked in a muffled voice as she walked up to my desk. I looked up at her, thinking for a second she was talking about me. That was until I remembered that this entire time, Wilson hadn’t shown up at all. I stared at Rachel for a moment before turning to see if Wilson would somehow magically appear. 



“I have no idea. I got here even earlier than I usually do, and he wasn’t here.” Both of us looked concerned. Where could Wilson have gone off to? Suddenly, as if hearing our calls, Wilson walked in through the front doors. He was covered from head to toe in leaves, branches, and thorns. And held gently but firmly in his hand was a white lily. He quickly ran over to us and presented the flower to Rachel. 



“Wha-” She sputtered, staring at the flower and slowly removing her face mask. The scar on her right cheek was deep and had only begun to heal, and I could see why Rachel hid it. But in that moment, she stared at this single flower, completely entranced and confused. “Where…did you get this?” She asked, reaching out to take the flower from Wilson. 



“Well. I felt horrible about not being able to protect you. And I heard you talking with Maggie that a white lily is your favorite flower. So last night I left the clinic to look for one! It was kinda hard to find, but I found one!” he said with a big smile, completely unfazed by the leaves and sticks that were protruding from his body. 



Rachel was completely stunned silent as she held the flower delicately in her hands. She looked back up at Wilson, and I could see that tears were starting to form in her pretty blue eyes. “This…is the nicest thing a guy has ever done for me.” She sniffled as the tears started flowing from her eyes. I quickly tapped her on the shoulder and handed her the box of tissues that I keep on my desk. “Thank you so much, Wilson. This means so much to me.” She sniffled as she wiped her eyes with my tissues. 



Wilson smiled happily and finally took notice of all the foliage stuck to him. He laughed it off as he brushed them off himself. “I’m glad my little adventure wasn’t in vain! I hope it makes you feel better, Ms. Rachel!” He gave the two of us a little salute before he took his usual post by the door. Rachel stared at her flower for a few more minutes before taking it with her back into one of the consultation rooms. 



It was possibly the sweetest ever interaction that I’d witnessed at the clinic, and it left my heart completely melted. Wilson has always been such a big sweetheart, and to see him go so far as to apologize to Rachel was just absolutely precious to see. We finally opened the clinic, and it proceeded surprisingly smoothly. Only one rowdy patient had to be dealt with, and even then, one look from Wilson was enough to quiet him down into submission. Time flew by, and before I knew it, it was lunchtime. I sat in my chair for a few minutes, wondering if I should even bother going to lunch. But when my tummy started rumbling, I figured I might as well. I stood up from my desk and made a quick scan around me to ensure that Dr. Harrison didn’t sneak up on me again. 



When I was sure that he was nowhere to be seen, I got up from my desk and walked over to the entrance. I smiled at Wilson as he held the door open for me. Normally, I would’ve gone to inform Dr. Harrison that I was leaving, but I wanted nothing to do with him for right now. And maybe depriving him of seeing me would just add to the punishment I was giving him. Arriving at the coffee shop, I was surprised to see it so busy at this hour. I sighed in annoyance and contemplated maybe going somewhere else, but I decided that I deserved a treat today, and elected to stand in line with everyone else. 



Luckily enough, the line moved along just fine, and soon I was face to face with Phillip again. He met me with a smile and quickly started to make my order. I thought about not getting Dr. Harrison his order of black coffee, but the thought of depriving him of caffeine was even too much for me, so I would just give it to Rachel to give to him. 



“So, have you thought about it?” Phillip asked me as he made my latte. I stared at him for a moment before remembering his invitation to lunch the day before. I felt my face go flush again as I stared at him. 



“I was thinking, dinner might be better?” I asked him, smiling as I pointed towards the chocolate croissants and requested three of them. He nodded and grabbed the tongs to get them. “It would just be easier for me, y’know?” I giggled a little, feeling like an idiot for being so forward with him. 



“Sure! I can pick you up if you want.” He offered, placing my croissants into a bag. I was so excited to hear that he wanted to go to dinner with me. But I already had a car, so it would just make sense to meet somewhere. 



“I can meet you there after work.” I offered, as I handed him my card to pay for my order. He smiled and nodded after he swiped my card and handed it back to me. I quickly reached into my purse and pulled out a sticky note and a pen. I quickly scribbled down my phone number with a heart next to it and handed it to him. He took it with a smile and nodded, before handing my my order and calling for the next customer behind me. 



I was giddy with excitement over my very first proper date. All the way back to work, I was giggling to myself and imagining where we would go. Finally arriving back at work, it was nice to see that nothing horrible had happened while I had gone off to get lunch. I handed Dr. Harrison’s black coffee to Rachel to give him, and I could tell she had love in her mind as well. 



I sat back down at my desk and picked my phone up to see that I had a message from an unknown number. My heart fluttered when I opened it and saw the text that had been sent my way. An address with a smiley face and a heart. 



“It’s Philip, isn’t it?” Dr. Harrison asked. I looked up from my phone to see that he was standing on the other side of my desk. He had a mix of anger and sadness on his face. I stared at him for a moment before clearing my throat and turning my phone off. 



“I don’t see how that’s any of your business, sir. In fact, don’t you have a surgery to get to?” I looked at him and tapped the file that was in front of both of us. He looked down at it and let out a defeated sigh as he grabbed the manila folder and sauntered off to the surgery room. I sighed and ate my croissant, annoyed that he’d returned to his sad, mopey self. But if it meant he stopped stalking me, then I could live with it. 



As closing time came around and the last few patients left, I looked up from my paperwork to see Rachel approaching Wilson. I set my pen down and watched what was about to unfold. Rachel was holding the lily again and looked up at Wilson, who smiled down at her.



“I was wondering. If maybe, you’d wanna go to lunch together? Tomorrow,” she asked him. He looked confused at first before seemingly figuring out that she wanted the two of them to go and eat together. He quickly nodded with excitement and wrapped his arms around her in a big hug. 



“I would love to!” he shouted excitedly, letting her go before looking down at the clothes he seemingly was always wearing. “Um, is it okay if I go like this?” he asked her. She smiled and tapped him on the arm. 



“Maybe we’ll go clothes shopping too.” She giggled before waving goodbye to him. I couldn’t help but kick my feet in excitement at the new blossoming relationship between these two. It gave me hope for my own that was starting soon. I stood up from my desk and was about to leave when I was suddenly stopped by Dr. Harrison, blocking my way. 



“What is it now, sir?” I asked him, almost sure that he was going to try and stop me. He looked down at me before getting out of my way and letting me leave. But before I left completely, he left me with his haunting line. 



“I didn’t go through your mail,” he said as I left the clinic. I didn’t truly process that until I was back in my car and inputting the address Phil had given me into my GPS. Was he lying? I wouldn’t put it past him to do that, but he had admitted to being the one to break into my house and leave the lungs. But if he hadn’t broken into my mailbox. Then who the hell did? 



As I drove to the destination that Phil had sent me, I was confused to find that it led to a parking garage. I stared at the building for a moment, and shot a text to Phil asking if I was at the right place. He confirmed that it was, and told me that he wanted to walk together to the restaurant he had chosen. I didn’t think much of it and drove into the garage. Finding a parking spot, I exited my car and locked it. 



“There she is!” Phil said excitedly as I exited my car. I looked over and smiled upon seeing him. I closed the distance between us and threw my arms around him. I was so happy to begin my first-ever date. That was quickly cut short when Phil stabbed me in the stomach. 



I let out a surprised gasp and pulled away from him. Blood began to pour out of my stomach as I quickly tried to cover the wound with my hands. I looked back at Phil and saw that he had a switchblade in his hand. He smiled at me with nothing but contempt in his eyes. 



“W-what are you doing?!” I screamed, trying to turn away and run from him. But he quickly grabbed my hair and yanked me back to him. He held his knife up to my throat and quickly succeeded in silencing me by doing so. 



“You fat bitches are so easy to manipulate.” He laughed at me, pressing the knife deeper into my neck. “You really thought I would date someone like you? Yeah right!” He laughed at me. I tried to struggle against him and reach into my purse for my pepper spray, but I could feel my strength leaving me as blood continued to seep through my stomach wound. 



“Now let’s make this nice and easy, yeah?” He asked me, and I knew for sure that I was going to die here in this parking garage. And I would’ve. 



But suddenly, Phil let go of me and dropped his knife. I staggered forward and turned to look at him. He was standing there completely motionless like a statue. I staggered forward but soon lost feeling in my legs and collapsed to the floor. When I managed to look up again, I saw something exiting from the darkness of the parking garage, with bright green shining eyes staring directly at me. 



“J…ames?” I croaked out as I slowly began to lose consciousness. 



“It’s okay, Maggie. I’ll make sure he suffers for doing this to you.” He reached out to hold my hand and gently squeezed it. I nodded and slowly drifted off to sleep. To think that my stalker had just saved me from a murderer.
