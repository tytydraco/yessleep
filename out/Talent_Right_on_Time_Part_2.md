\* \* \* HOUR SIX \* \* \*

As the Curator had promised, Sophie began to widen her social milieu. People who had ignored her now asked to sit with her at lunch, collaborate on homework, and party after hours. They asked her advice at every turn, from which of the latest fashion trends were worth following to which colleges to visit. Even though she didn’t have all the answers, Sophie acted like she did. Therein lay the secret. She dared not admit the other parts:

She could read minds. Surface thoughts only, but they were enough.

She could also discern when anyone lied to her. They did – a lot. “Fake it till you make it” was the unofficial motto of high school and, she suspected, of life.

Most alarmingly, she learned hidden truths about people whenever she touched them. Even brushing up against them in the hallway, she could tell which girls had anorexia or bulimia, which athletes were using steroids, and which teachers were at the end of their rope due to students’ misbehavior. This constant onslaught of knowledge was dizzying. She learned to tune most of it out like she tuned out boring lectures. Still, this thrilled her as much as basking in others’ attention. Her new friends gave her a sense of importance that her old ones never had – except Miranda. Even though she now played second fiddle to Sophie’s new cadre, she remained loyal and told the truth when it needed telling.

Hence Sophie’s misgivings about the end of the month.

What did the Curator want with Miranda? To steal her spirit? To take her away?

No. That would be evil, and Sophie swore she hadn’t called upon an evil being.

He had mentioned experiences and vistas far beyond this world. What kind? What lessons would her best friend learn to help her on good old Planet Earth?

The more Sophie thought about it, the more disturbed she became.

For the first time in her life, she ignored her priceless collections, even her new friends, and focused entirely on the problem of her old one. What could Miranda offer the Curator that Sophie couldn’t give him? Belief and blind trust, but that was all. Sophie could help him with what she’d learned. Wasn’t that what knowledge was for? Why not put it to practical use? What Sophie now knew eclipsed what Miranda knew by an order of magnitude.

Ridiculous, it was. Ridiculous that the mysterious stranger Sophie had contacted favored Miranda instead. Well, Sophie would show him. She’d prove her worth.

When November 30^(th) came, Sophie went to the rendezvous alone.

She waited and waited. By the light of the full moon, she could see the crossroads stretching into the distance, discarded trash blowing across its fairway.

She did not see the Curator.

At long last, a thick strip of paper with three words in blood blew across her path:

I WARNED YOU.

Hot fear filled Sophie’s heart. What kind of penalty would the Curator impose?

As he had specified, the deal was off. As he had also suggested, the penalty was both monetary and personal. Her retinue ignored her like yesterday’s news once they realized how shallow Sophie was.

Once she’d gone home after meeting no one at the crossroads, she’d smashed most of her collectibles. What had once cost her a fortune lay on her bedroom floor in hundreds of pieces. All she could do was clean up the mess and cry.

“Damn you, Miranda,” Sophie wept. “I hope I never see your big fat face again.”

At 3 AM, she got the call. Her best friend since forever had committed suicide.

\* \* \*

Oh, dear. That escalated quickly.

\*It did not. It progressed in its time, and we both barely paid attention.\*

We? Who is ‘we,’ and who are you? Jeanette? You don’t sound like her.

\*I don’t know who Jeanette is, but it’s time you learned who I am – the owner of Cinderella’s Curios, and the subject of your tale.\*

A horrible realization dawns on me. “You’re Sophie,” I say aloud. “Sophie Tafus.”

“Yes. Rearrange the letters of my last name and you’ll understand me.”

Tafus. Faust. The man who sold his soul to the Devil for knowledge.

Sophie had done the same.

\*The Curator is not Satan, but he demands prompt payment for his boons.\*

“Payment. You didn’t bring Miranda to the crossroads, because you were jealous. The Curator wanted to help her, but you didn’t. You wanted her to stay the same, in second place behind your new acquaintances. You bitch.”

\*Hear me out. I’ve spent the rest of my life trying to atone for what I did to her. I dedicated myself to granting others’ wishes. In terms of my collections, I built one to share instead of hoard. Ergo, my little shop. Everything I have is for sale to others or to be given away. That watch was my gift to you.\*

“You mean the Curator’s watch? The one that’s drawing my blood right now? That’s a gift? More like a curse. I can’t even risk taking it off. I’m in too deep.”

“Indeed you are. Now that you know whose story you’re telling and what you’ve exchanged for talent, our mutual benefactor won’t let you go until you finish.”

“IF I finish.”

“You must. If the clock strikes twelve and you have not, then you belong to him.”

“Oh, yeah?”

“Miranda does. She’s at peace. He has a soft spot for the innocent.”

“Then he’ll let me go.”

“Are you willing to let your newfound talent go?”

Touche. I continue.   

\* \* \* HOUR NINE \* \* \*

Sophie felt numb from her head to her toes. Miranda couldn’t be dead. She just couldn’t. True, Sophie had done her a bad turn, but had that been enough to –

“No.” She shivered all over. “It can’t be. Miranda is – was – tougher than that.”

Had she been? On balance, the answer was no. Miranda’s strength wasn’t her strength, but her heart. Now that Miranda’s heart was stilled forever…

“I have no one,” Sophie said. “No one and nothing.”

Thus, the Curator’s penalty proved absolute. Sophie fell into despair. Her grades slipped, and she no longer cared about activities she used to enjoy.

All except buying new things. If this desire had obsessed her before, now it consumed her outright. She spent all the money she made working at her after-school job on expensive curios: crystal, coins, porcelain dolls, china figurines, each lovelier than the last. Her new collection was so stunning that even her parents found themselves standing and staring at it, hypnotized by its beauty.

As it grew, it took up more and more space, spreading from Sophie’s bedroom to the guest bedroom, then the living room. Her house began to resemble a museum more than a home. She had to tell her parents to be careful not to break any of its exhibits. What she didn’t tell her parents was the nature of the driving force that made her acquire them.

The objects spoke to her.

She cared for them as lovingly as if they were flesh-and-blood friends.

Yet just like human friends, these objects took an emotional and physical toll.

Sophie found it increasingly hard to get up in the morning and muster any kind of interest in school. No matter where she was – homeroom, the gym, the cafeteria – she wished she were at home tending to her new collection. Her best collection. Little did she know what it was for until the Winter Solstice rolled around.

December 21^(st) was the shortest and darkest day of the year. Instead of spending time with her family before Christmas, she put on her parka and made her way to the crossroads a third time. A full moon shone once again upon its intersection.

“Greetings.”

Sophie was neither surprised nor afraid. She knew whom she’d come to meet.

“Hello, Curator.”

After a brief pause, he stepped – or rather hovered – toward her.

“What do you require of me?”

“Another bargain. I have a new collection that I’m willing to trade.” She swallowed hard, and she could see puffs of her breath in the air. “Bring Miranda back.”

“I cannot.”

“Yes, you can. I know who you are. If you can’t restore her to her body, could you please let me speak to her soul? Er, spirit. My valuables are all I have. They’re almost all I love. Take them and let me talk to my best friend one more time.”

“Such trifles mean nothing to me. However, since they mean so much to you, I’ll consider them acceptable collateral. You must promise me three things as well.”

“Anything!”

“First: You must dedicate your life to serving others. That includes selling your valuables at discount prices or giving them away as gifts. You will keep collecting and granting others’ wishes until you fulfill my other two requirements.

“Second: You must find someone else to tell your story as a cautionary tale. Forewarned is forearmed, as the old saying goes.

“Third: You must take my watch as a sealing token of our pact. Wear it until the bearer of your tale comes along. Someone as ambitious and proud as you are. Keep it active until you meet that person, then present my most prized possession to them. I aim to leave this world behind and venture to further dimensions.”

“Before I agree, I’d like to know: How much time do I have to accomplish all this?”

The Curator’s eyes narrowed to slits. “Fifty years from the date you first sought me out: Halloween. If you have not finished these tasks by then, I’ll take you with me, body, soul, and spirit, to places where no living mortal has a right to be. You won’t find solace there until you’ve learned the lessons that you should have long ago.”

“What if I find a substitute? If I can convince someone else to go with you instead, will you consider our pact fulfilled?”

After an eternity he replied, “Yes. In full.”

“Okay, then. How do I talk to Miranda? Do you need any more of my blood?”

“Yes. Three more drops, please.” Sophie gave them as she had before. “Now, then. When I step back from these crossroads, you’ll see her and can say what you will. You’ll only have one minute before her shade returns to where I am. Agreed?”

Sophie swallowed hard. “Agreed.”

The Curator stepped back, allowing wintry moonlight to shine full upon Sophie.

She stared and blinked. The form of her best friend shimmered in the frosty air.

“M-Miranda? Is that you?” Sophie knelt. “I’m sorry I threw you over for those other so-called friends of mine. They aren’t anymore. I was selfish and took you for granted. I never realized how much you meant to me until…” Until Miranda died? The dark thought flashed across Sophie’s mind, then vanished. “Until now. I wanted to see you one last time so I could tell you how much I love you. I miss you so much. I know I can’t have you back for all time, but I’m glad to have you for one minute more. Christmas is coming up. There’s only one thing I want. Not another tchotchke or piece of art. Your forgiveness. Will you please grant it to me?”  

Sophie felt a warm presence wrap itself around her. A barely audible voice: “Yes. I love you too. Merry Christmas, and I beg of you: Fulfill your terms.”

“I will. Thank you.”

Flakes of snow began to fall through Miranda and to the ground. She disappeared.

So did the Curator.

Sophie returned home to find that her valuables’ voices had fallen still.

The first thing she did was wrap up an angel figurine to give her mother. On Christmas morning, Sophie’s mom was surprised and pleased. She’d never seen her daughter give away any of her precious things before, whether physical or intangible. Was Sophie turning over a new leaf? Only time would tell.

It did.

After she graduated high school, Sophie opened up a series of collectible and antique shops in the city. They made her a tidy profit, which she donated to cancer research centers and homeless shelters. She also delivered meals to homebound people and hired those with disabilities to assist her in her stores. Sophie may not have been Citizen of the Year in the forty-nine years she spent helping others, but she was darn close. Only one part of her bargain remained.

The cruel final terms.

Who would tell Sophie’s story and forewarn others of the dangers of selfishness, greed, and obsession? Who would wear the Curator’s watch, given as a gift? Most importantly, who would go with the Curator to other worlds in Sophie’s place?

\* \* \*

That’s where I came in.

That’s where I still come in.

There’s one hour till midnight.

One hour to polish this story and send it to Jeanette.

Can I finish in time? I’m so weak…

\* \* \* HOUR ELEVEN \* \* \*

Sophie lay wide awake on a late September evening. It wasn’t Halloween, but the fateful deadline was close enough. She dared not leave any more to chance.

She’d taken enough of a risk giving the Curator’s watch to a writer with the pseudonym of Tenet. Thanks to that particular timepiece, the best copy editor at Mundi Macabre could have her big break. Pure, unadulterated talent would flow like blood through her veins, and there would be no clots. No longer would she slave away proofreading others’ works. Tenet would write an epic tale that would headline the magazine’s annual Halloween issue and catapult her straight to the top. All it would cost her? Fifty dollars and blood drawn on the hour, every hour, for twelve hours straight. The pact with the Curator would be sealed thus.

The thing was, Tenet hadn’t known about the Curator – or Sophie either.

She’d thought the owner of Cinderella’s Curios was a kind and gentle older woman with round wire-rimmed glasses. That much was true. She’d never suspected that the gift giver had ulterior motives. However, what if she had? Would she have entered into the bargain anyway? Humbly, Tenet realized the answer was yes.

She believed in herself, so much so that she believed she could outwit Death.

She only had thirty minutes left.

In Goethe’s “Faust,” the protagonist repented and ended up being saved. In Christopher Marlowe’s “Doctor Faustus,” the main character was damned. The difference was one of lessons learned: pride versus humility, ambition versus acceptance, hope versus despair. Sophie had learned these lessons well over the past fifty years, but what about Tenet? Which option would she choose – the one that would save her life or the one that would save her spirit?

One more dilemma awaited her.

Miranda had forgiven Sophie for forsaking her in her hour of need. Would Tenet do the same for leading her on and not telling her about the Curator? There was a lot to be said for absolution, but also for balance and justice. Two values that the Curator himself prized.

“Why should I forgive you?” Tenet asked out loud. “Give me one good reason.”

Within her mind, Sophie answered, \*Because we’re too much alike.\*

“Good point.”

\*If you pardon me, you pardon yourself as well, and the Curator will be defeated.\*

“Aren’t you forgetting who he is?”

\*Like I said, he has a soft spot for the innocent. Like Miranda. Like you.\*

“What if he decides to ignore it in my case, because I was willing to give anything for raw talent? Because I aimed too high, like Faust – and like you?”

\*If he does,\* said Sophie, \*you must be prepared to fulfill the terms of your deal.\*

“To travel with him to other planes of existence and leave Earth behind?”

\*I’m afraid so.\*

“Then,” announced Tenet, “I forgive you. I won’t be afraid. I’ll go where he wants me to go and learn what he wants me to learn. What will you do, Sophie Tafus?”

\*I’ll continue to operate Cinderella’s Curios as a normal shop, with no hidden fees or pacts. My business with the Curator will be concluded.\*

Tenet smiled. “It’s a deal.”

Sophie’s voice faded from her mind, and the two women could rest at last.

What does Halloween hide?

The arrival of Death: the only known in a world of unknowns.

That, and hope that springs eternal.

THE END

\* \* \*

I’m finished. I’m finally finished.

I open Gmail and send this story to Jeanette with five minutes to spare.

Whether or not she thinks it’s fantastic is her business. She could keep me in my current place as the servant of all at Mundi Macabre, but I’ve since discovered there are worse fates. Fates that exist beyond space, time, and horror magazines.

The blood drains miraculously from the Curator’s watch when the hour hand reaches twelve. Time for bed. New stories await, but they can wait.

My work is done.

Tomorrow I’ll get up, get ready, push the watch button, and \*humbly\* try again.
