It’s been a rough day. I mean ROUGH. Let’s dive in.

I found Sloth. It wasn’t how I would have wanted to do it, though. Instead, things went a little rough. I found my way back to the Demo. or at least the Demo found its way back to me. 

Let’s see… so things were pretty chill the rest of the day after I made the last update. I swiped some magnets from the desk at the library and tied them around a small bar I found in an alley. That way, if the glitch managed to come back for me I had it ready to go, giving it a good whack and taking it out. If only the plans went right.

I don’t know where it came from or how it just found me, but I was trying to sleep in an alleyway last night. Figured I would be safe there, not much tech around to worry about anything. I have a stupid theory it came out of the computers at the library but I have no idea if that’s how it works. 

Feels like I had just drifted off, sleep finally overtaking me despite trying to stay alert. The sounds of the city around me were loud but I’ve been able to tune them out for years. Maybe that’s why I didn’t notice it at first. The sudden static, a hum beginning quietly before roaring to a constant, crashing crescendo of chaos. That was around when I woke up, seeing the Glitch standing at the end of the alleyway as I sprung up from the makeshift bed of garbage I was sleeping on.

I barely had time to grab the magnet pipe before it was on me, faster than it had moved before. Closing my eyes, I gave the hardest swing I could toward it, hoping it was enough. The magnets stopped it momentarily, the singularity coming to a complete standstill. The parts bending out from it began to shrink in again, once more folding in on itself.

If it managed to grab me or if it was just the force of it disappearing, somehow it took me along, screaming for my damn life. My eyes weren’t closed but all I could see for a moment was darkness, before dropping into a blinding, white light. When it finally faded, I could see I was in the alleyway, stripped of any of the clutter. Walls looked painted on, with fire escapes were simply drawn on top of them without structure. For a minute I was losing my mind, wondering how in the hell I got back here again. Then the Glitch started screaming again. Louder this time.

Glitch was obviously feeling some hurt from the magnet, but at this point, it was starting to become something different. The painted-on face stayed the same, grinning malevolently with empty white eyes, wide open to see everything. The body was bending and morphing more though. I was barely able to catch myself before the magnet pipe was torn from my hands, hitting a wall. When it impacted, the magnets left pixelation briefly before it was covered by the texture again, briefly popping out of existence first.

The only option I had was to make a break for it and hope for the best. Ducking around the Glitch, heart pounding, I ran out of the alleyway into the street, hoping to whatever god made this fucking place that the layout was still the same as the city I knew. 

Made the classic mistake while I was running and looked behind me to see if it was following. Yeah, stupid me. It wasn’t the same Glitch that had been hunting me. This fucking thing had evolved, the bending limbs stretching out into dozens of legs as it crawled toward me on all of them. Arms were long, propping the torso up like some fucked up centaur, face now glitching in and out, changing faces and voices as the “Hello?” grew louder and more frantic. Thankfully, despite the appearance of it just gliding along, it must not have been used to the new movement style. Either that or it just got a major downgrade on speed in return for becoming a nightmare 

By the time I got a few blocks down I was out of breath. I could hear the Glitch far behind me, but wasn’t sure where the hell it was. The one thing I was sure of was I knew this part of town much better. Wall Street. Where all the rich people live and we on the street pick up the scraps. I’ve done a lot of pickpocketing here, even more time just begging for scraps, hoping people would take pity on a woman. Except the people here didn’t have any pity, only greed. I got spit on and propositioned more times than I ever got a cent.

While I was catching my breath I took in my surroundings, seeing everything familiar as if it hadn’t quite loaded in yet. Most of the buildings were still the same, though many had different, more outdated signs. A banner on one of the bank doors caught my eye, huge letters with fireworks all around in celebration.

HAPPY NEW YEAR! SEE YOU NEXT CENTURY!

Memories snapped back into place for me, suddenly, clearly, with a force that would put that truck the other day to shame. I still remember begging out here that night. Dad kicked me out again, not for the first time. A seven-year-old out on the streets alone, I did what I could to try and eat. Always heard that Wall Street was where anyone could make money, so I made my way there thinking I could earn a few dollars for a Happy Meal or something.

I was seven, cut me some slack. I learned how things worked pretty fast after that.

It was raining. New Year's Eve 1999. I was huddled under a little awning, one right across the street from me right then actually. I remember a man walking up, showing the first hint of kindness I had seen in the seven hours I had been there. That same banner that was blurry and pasted on in the Demo was right there. 

“Are you alone, son?” Those were the first words he asked me. When I nodded, all he said was, “Well, I could buy you some food, if you’d like to play.”

I was hungry but even seven-year-old me had alarm bells. I ran as fast as I could, though I don’t think he even tried to follow me. He was older, balding, and wearing a freshly pressed suit. Considering the cigar stink radiating off of him, I’m assuming he wasn’t much of a runner.

Sorry, still dealing with a lot of these memories coming back. I… I’ve been running from shit for a long time, y’know? My mom died when I was still a baby, dad apparently realized pretty early on that I wasn’t going to be the pro-athlete son he always wanted. Don’t think I’ve even spoken to him since I was twelve, so god knows how he would react seeing I’m not his son anymore. Hell, as far as he’s concerned I probably never was anyway.

The Glitch roaring jerked me back to my senses, getting closer at a much faster rate than when I had left it. I looked back and realized why- it was growing larger. The number of legs filled the entire street now, with faces changing even faster on its head. The same, terrifying smile was always there, but the teeth and inside kept changing, taking on different textures and colors, from sharp teeth to just a blue void. The eyes remained solid white, while the entire skull kept stretching and growing, enlarging the pasted-on face so it looked even more grotesque.

It was close. Closer than I wanted it to be. I don’t know when I started screaming, but at least I was trying to find somewhere to get away. The doorway of a bank nearby caught my eye, appearing different than the others, almost completely white. I swear it wasn’t that way a few minutes before, but I was also having a pretty bad flashback so my mind is pretty messy.

I swear I ran faster than I ever had, going for the door with every fiber of energy I had left in me. When I tell you I was nowhere near prepared for what was next, I mean it. I thought my life was about to end here, forgotten. Nobody in the real world would give a shit, anyway. I was a stray, one of millions of Americans living on the bottom just scraping by. Not a single person would go looking for me.

I hit the doorway with all my might, hoping to bust the door open. Instead, it busted me. I was knocked back hard, thrown across the street right on my ass. A little luck had my back, though, sort of. At least the pavement wasn’t actually pavement, just a slick sheet of hard static with the look of a paved street painted on. I slid across, over the painted curb, and into the wall. 

I was a little dazed after that. It. hurt, I think I may have hit my head at one point. When I opened my eyes though, the Glitch was screaming closer, ready to bear down on me. Everything hurt, and I tried to force myself up to run, but the strength just wasn’t there. I was so dizzy I could barely tell up from down. I don’t know what bounced me but it hit me hard enough to completely kick my brain for a good minute.

Over the screaming I heard another voice, this time a little familiar. 

“What in the hell are you doing here? Didn’t I throw you back on like… Monday? Wasn’t it Monday?” The Sloth was walking up, quickly slipping the mask down over his head while looking at another figure standing alongside him. This one was tall, lean but muscled, dressed in all black with a Raven mask over his face.

”How the fuck should I know? Who is this?” The Raven asked Sloth, gesticulating a hand toward me. “I thought living people couldn’t get in here? Did you let her in?”

The screaming of the Glitch grew louder, only a couple of blocks down the street now. Its growth seemed slowed down, with fewer legs growing from the torso. The face was still changing, more rapidly while sometimes blinking completely out of existence, leaving an empty black void where it was. All I could do was point to it and scream for help as it got closer.

”Oh shit. I’ve never seen one like that. Have you? That looks mean.” Sloth remarked, turning to look at the Glitch as it moved closer. Raven stepped forward, raising a hand in front of him and centering it on the creature.

”We don’t have time for this shit.” Raven briefly raised his hand above his head before slicing it downward through the air, a chopping motion in the direction of the Glitch. A wave of solid light extended from his hand as he made the movement, extending far enough to slice the Glitch directly in half down the middle.

I’ll be totally honest here if you’re looking for answers- I don’t know. All I could really say at the time was that the Glitch was what brought me here, that it had been after me since the other day. Sloth and Raven just stood there and listened, never taking off their masks. 

“Can we finish up? Only three days until we do this.” Raven said, crossing arms in front of him. I was still in shock after seeing the thing that’s been chasing me for days just get sliced in half like paper. Now I was finally able to ask questions to the one that saved me the first time and I could barely fucking speak. Raven gestured to a nearby doorway. “You gonna open it for her?”

”Hold up, hold up, hold up! The Glitch was in the real world? Like our world?” Sloth asked me. My heart was still racing, but I was getting the feeling they knew about as much as I did about that thing. “You’re not even supposed to be here.”

”How are you here, then?” That was all I could get out. Sloth actually started laughing at that question.

”I fucking died.” He laughed even harder. “You mean you didn’t have some near-death experience or anything? Meet anyone who gave you a talk? None of that?”

”I pushed my friend out of the way of a truck and it hit me. I ended up in here.” Things were making less sense than before. “They told me I disappeared until you threw me back like twenty minutes later.”

”I’m sorry, you’ve spoken to her before? In here? What does she know?” Raven was asking as Sloth still laughed, starting to cough now from not being able to catch his breath.

”Oh my god, chill. I literally just threw her through a door. Holy shit, this changes a lot of stuff. We had no idea you could just get knocked in here. Hell, you might’ve had the least terrible experience out of all of us. God, wait until we tell Tam, they’re going to be so pissed.” He was laughing again, clapping Raven on the shoulder. “Sorry, a friend of ours, his trip here was SUPER unpleasant, even compared to all of us. Don’t know if the universe just likes fucking with him or what but… woo, too long of a story. Anyway.”

Sloth turned toward the door nearby, raising a hand and flipping his palm from face down to upright in its direction. A black void overtook the doorway, blotting out any of the markings on it.

”Look, this isn’t a good place to be. You’re gonna want to stay out of here if you can help it.” Sloth offered.

”Please go, we’re on a time crunch.” Raven said. Even through the mask, I could feel his eyes rolling as he spoke.

I was pretty hesitant to walk toward the door, trying to gauge if it was okay to go through or not. Sloth waved me along, telling me to get out of there before more Glitches showed up. I closed my eyes, stepping through the doorway and out into the dark street, the sun barely starting to break over the horizon.

Weird as it sounds, I haven’t had any of those dread feelings since I got back. Maybe they really were able to get rid of the Glitch, at least I hope they were. Things are still shitty, hard not to be that way when you’re living on the streets. I still don’t know who they were, but I’m keeping my eyes out for anything that seems out of the ordinary. Might be back on the street, but we’ll make it through. I can feel a change in the air, and I’ve learned to trust my gut after living so long as a [stray](https://www.reddit.com/user/googlyeyes93/comments/1efyman/strays_chapter_masterlist/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
