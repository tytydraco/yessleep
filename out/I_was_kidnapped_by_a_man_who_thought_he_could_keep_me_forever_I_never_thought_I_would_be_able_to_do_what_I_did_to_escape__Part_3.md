CW: Physical Abuse

I eventually lost track of time. It could’ve been days, or maybe weeks. I stopped counting early on. I used hunger to keep my mind off the time.

It relentlessly gnawed at me. My body begged for food, or water, or literally anything to remind me that I was still alive. The man, whose name I still didn’t know, came in and out sporadically, never staying for too long, but always keeping an eye on me. When he chose to speak, it was always deliberate. Every word was cryptic and measured.

His voice slid along the walls, quiet and cold, sinking into the back of my mind.

“I’m just making you into something better.” He repeated again and again, as though repetition could absolve him, or convince himself the lie was no less monstrous than the truth.

As much as he said it, I could never understand what it meant. Better how? Better for what? What did he even mean by that?

When he first bound me in the chains, I convinced myself that it was just a temporary thing. He couldn’t keep me here forever, right? He had to let me go eventually. Or, I thought, maybe somebody would come looking for me, and at any minute they’d bust down the door and find me. At the very least, I figured that if he meant to kill me, he would’ve done it long before now. That gave me hope, albeit very little.

As the days passed, the old, wooden door opened less frequently. It felt like I was being tested, like a rat in a cage being dared to break free. Every time I worked up the courage to scream or pound on the walls, the only response I’d get was a low, amused laugh.

“Such a fighter. You remind me of someone,” he’d say, almost fondly. But he never elaborated. He never said anything that suggested I would ever make it out of there.

Each day brought some new form of psychological torture, but the nights were always the worst. I always knew when they began. The faint sound of the TV upstairs clicking off, followed by his heavy, uneven snoring seeping through the floorboards, signaled the end of another long day.

After that, everything went still. That was when the thick, suffocating quiet settled in, and the isolation hit the hardest. In those moments, I felt more forgotten than ever.

Though it contributed, the silence wasn’t the only thing that terrified me. It was what I began to hear in that silence. Faint, little noises seemed to come from all around me. Soft scratches persisted into the night, followed by faint dragging sounds, like something sharp scraping against wood.

At first, I thought I was imagining it. I figured he had finally broken me, and I had fully gone insane. But the longer I listened, the clearer they became. I realized the noises weren’t coming from my head. They were coming from inside the walls.

I didn’t dare speak at first, afraid that he would hear me and punish me again. But, eventually, the constant scraping wore me down. I couldn’t take it any longer. I had to know what it was.

“Who’s there?” I whispered, listening closely for a response.

There was no answer. Nothing but the same relentless noise persisted.

Over the next few days, the scratching continued, steady and desperate, like someone was trying to claw their way toward me from the other side.

The noises sparked my curiosity, but more importantly, they gave me a fragile sliver of hope. I thought that maybe something else was trapped in here, just like me, trying so desperately to escape. It gave me the courage I needed to push on.

I had to know what was happening. I had to know what or who was behind that wall.

It felt like an eternity before light crept under the door once more. It was him, but this time, there was something different in the way he moved. I could hear the faint clink of the keys as he made his way to the door, followed by the slow, deliberate turn of the lock.

When he stepped inside, I noticed something I had never seen in him before. There was a wild gleam in his eyes, sharp with a sort of feverish hunger.

“You’re getting weaker,” he said, standing over me, scanning me like a piece of meat. “It’s time we had a real conversation.”

I wanted to speak, but my throat was dry, parched from nearly a full day without water. My body hung heavy against the chains, the metal biting into my wrists just enough to remind me that I was still alive.

I was exhausted.

He crouched down in front of me, bringing his face closer to mine until I could feel his breath against my skin.

“You’ve been hearing things, haven’t you?” He asked, grinning like a child.

My gaze flicked toward the wall before I could stop it, trying to dismiss the question, but he caught it.

He let out a low, satisfied chuckle.

“Don’t worry about them,” he said, as if my fears were inconsequential. “They’re like you… Well, they were, once. But they didn’t learn their place.”

A shudder tore through me. Each one of his words landed like heavy punches against my skull.

He raised his hand and brushed my hair back, his touch light and gentle, but I could feel the icy malevolence beneath it. His fingers lingered a little too long, too possessively. The contact slithered under my skin, making it twitch and crawl, desperate to tear itself away from his touch.

“Now,” he whispered, his breath warm and wet against my ear, “I’m going to let you in on a little secret, Emily.”

My heart skipped a beat. I felt like I knew exactly what he was going to say next, but I wasn’t fully prepared for him to.

“You’re not the only one down here.” He said, smiling ear to ear. “There are more, and let me tell you, they are very interested in you. You are all they’ve been able to talk about for the last few days.”

He chuckled, as if he were telling me some sarcastic joke, but I wasn’t laughing.

“Don’t worry, you’ll meet them soon enough,” he continued, “I just need to make sure you’re ready.”

I felt sick. I wanted to scream in his face, but my body was too weak. I began to shake violently as I finally managed to force out a few broken words.

“No... please...” I begged, trying to plead to the glimpse of humanity I had seen in him that first day.

He smiled at the fear in my voice, then clicked his tongue. “Tsk-tsk-tsk, you’ll understand soon. You’ll all understand.”

He stood up abruptly and pivoted toward the door. He grabbed the old brass handle and pulled it open, quickly slipping back into the hallway. Before he fully closed the door, he turned back to look at me one last time, smiling wide as ever.

"Don't worry, Emily,” he said in a low, predatory rasp, “you’ll be fine. Just... be good for me."

With that, the door slammed shut, leaving me alone with the sounds of scratching still emanating from the walls.

Three days later, or what I thought was three days, I was losing track of everything. Days bled into one another, while hours seemed to pass like minutes.

The hunger still gnawed at me, but it was no longer the worst thing.

Now, the waiting had become my greatest enemy. Dread hung in the air like static, gnawing at my senses. The feeling of something terrible lurking just out of sight remained ever-present in my mind. It grew worse every time the door opened. I never knew who, or what might appear. Most of the time, it was him. But one day… it wasn’t… It was someone else.

That morning was calmer than usual. I hadn’t heard the usual commotion upstairs or in the hallway. I thought that he had finally grown tired of tormenting me and had left me to die.

I was deep into my own self-pity when I heard footsteps approaching. I pressed myself against the wall, bracing for the worst. When the door finally opened, it wasn’t his silhouette that filled the frame. It was a woman.

She looked almost as pale as I felt. Her eyes were wide and frantic. Her hair was tangled and matted against her forehead as if she hadn’t seen a shower in months. She looked like someone who had been here far too long.

She stared at me with a desperate intensity, as if she wanted to say something but couldn’t find the words. After an agonizingly awkward few seconds, she spoke.

“Are you... Okay?” she asked, her voice trembling.

The words barely escaped her throat, as if speaking them cost her more strength than she had.

I nodded slowly, unsure how to respond. I had no idea who she was or how long she’d been down here, but I could feel the bond instantly. There was this unspoken connection between us. We both shared an understanding of the horrors this place contained.

“I… I heard you before,” she said, her voice a whisper. “The scratching. I thought... maybe it was you. I… I tried to answer back.”

My mind was fried. I had no idea what was going on. I could barely connect one thought to the next, but I knew this was not some strange coincidence. The scratching, the extended time he had left me alone, this strange woman in front of me… It was all connected in some weird way.

I swallowed hard, forcing myself to speak.

“What’s going on here?” I asked nervously. “What’s that sound in the walls?”

She took a deep, shaky breath, glancing over her shoulder with a nervous pause, as if she expected him to appear at any moment.

"Others," she whispered, "like us, except… they didn’t learn fast enough."

I felt my stomach tighten.

“How long... how long have you been here?” I asked, trying my best to remain quiet.

Her eyes welled up with tears, but she quickly wiped them away.

“Too long. Too fucking long.” She said in a bitter tone. "I don't even know what month it is anymore."

I wanted to ask her more. I wanted to know everything, but before I could speak another word, those familiar, heavy footsteps echoed through the corridor. Her face drained of color as she quickly ducked back into the hallway, yanking the door closed behind her.

She hadn’t gotten far before he had caught her in the hallway. I couldn’t see it, but I could hear him scolding her. A barrage of curses and screams filled the room, thankfully muffled by the thickness of the wood and brick.

After a few tense moments, the door creaked open again, and this time he was the one who stepped in.

He didn’t speak a word. He just stood there staring at me. After a while, he reached in and grabbed the door handle, never letting his eyes leave mine. A twisted smile slowly spread across his face as he pulled the door shut, leaving me alone once more.
