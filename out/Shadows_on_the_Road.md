A young teenager is a stupid creature. Scientifically proven because their brains aren’t done developing which can lead to thoughts and ideas of being immortal. I was no exception in this. Understanding now that I’m older doesn’t change the fact that I was a rather idiotic being, full of hormones and being what, today, is known as Neurodivergent, invariably led me to make impulsive and dangerous choices. 


So to help you understand, I grew up rural and isolated in the midwest, the Ozarks. Yeah, I know the Appalachians are much better known, but hey at least I am being honest. Besides, the main difference is folks around here are tighter lipped than out east. Anywho, growing up where I did and as I did, I had developed an interest in all things horror which as I grew older the interest also grew into more. I became fascinated by local legends, seeking them out in order to try and “poke the bear”. 


Well, it was one of these local stories that caught my friends and I attention. I mean the place had the coolest name we had ever heard: Zombie Road. The rumors surrounding the place were insane, so of course it would eventually come onto our radar. When it did, we were instantly hooked. Now some of y’all may have heard of the place through a show, podcast, or book. Maybe even something online. Back then was something completely different though. One of those locals only, and if you weren’t a local you would get steered away as it were. 


Now it didn’t seem like much, an old dirt road next to some old railroad tracks. Always cooler than it should be, yeah, but that was easy enough to explain away. The fact is it was always fairly kept up with and kept clear, but not a single county worker went out there and it wasn’t the Conservation Department. Explained as civic minded locals. It was a beautiful walking trail and it wasn’t shared with outsiders except for family.


Not a single person can remember how the stories started or even why, just they had always been there. The rule was a simple one: Don’t walk the road after dark. And every year a few try. They come back… touched. They are never right again afterward, pale and terrified. Of course we were going to go! How could we resist? 


It was late when we got there, well past 11pm. I believe we were maybe 16 or 17 at this time before the road got shut down. It was the beginning of summer and a nice warm night. Biggest thing that was threatening us was the occasional June bug. So with only the cryptic “rule” hanging over our heads forward we went, to walk Zombie Road, completely clueless.


Goofing off and teasing each other as we went it was Cat, Emmy, Merrick, and myself. Taking bets on who would turn back first or piss their pants, that kind of thing so it took us a bit to realize what we should have. In fact it was Lynn that noticed first, shushing us. It was silent. Not a sound except the wind. Now the four of us grew up in the country and understood that wasn’t a good sign. 


“Maybe Coyotes?”, Merrick asked though we all knew we would have heard a pack. The air was suddenly heavy on us, like it feels before a storm and we all knew something was off, between that and the silence. “Coyotes my ass” I replied, the fine hairs rising on the back of my neck. Always a sign, though very rare, that something was there or was coming. No, we didn’t have flashlights (we were trying to get spooked), and this was well before smartphones. Lynn was the first to see them.


Up near the railroad tracks it looked like people standing there staring at us, silhouetted by the moon. So many we couldn’t count them all even if we tried. Perfect time for poor impulse control and bad decision making to kick in and I started toward them. The other three were trying to stop me, keep me from getting near the figures as they saw something I didn’t. These beings were opaque and slightly translucent in the moonlight with forms that would waver on occasion. Of course my brain replied with, “Imma touch it”, type of reaction. 


My friends watched on as I reached these entities that in time would be named “Shadow People”. I got up to them and promptly fell on my ass as I realized they seemed to be made of smoke or wisps of shadow. I could see not a single feature on any of them, only the shape of the shadow. I wish I could say I was smart enough to run, but I wasn’t. I slowly stood and because they didn’t do anything I figured they were harmless. I turned to my friends signaling that I was ok and trying to call them up to me, even though I knew they wouldn’t. 


Turning back I walked back to them, slowly. The air felt heavy as I got closer and went to step between two of them. I wanted to know If perhaps they looked differently on the other side. Their eyes. Each one's eyes. They were facing away from the road and now I was in front of them. Yellowish eyes, flickering like weak candles. And for both directions they were as far as I could see. With absolute precision each shadowed head turned to me and stared as if measuring me. The one closest to me was wearing what appeared to be one of those old fashion wide-brim, flat top hat. It smiled. I know because I saw the teeth, white and sharp. 


It reached out an arm, and smoke like fingers gripped my shoulder, those eyes holding me in place. Like a deer I was trapped by those two lights, even though the grip burned like fire. I was drawn close and a voice in my mind spoke; “Life is a short thing. Don’t make it shorter.” I am not ashamed to say I passed out.


I woke up in the back of the car as we were racing down the highway, with my head in Emmy’s lap. When she saw my eyes open, shy shouted, “He’s awake!”, and promptly slapped me. 


My friends came and retrieved me and got me to the car because all they saw was me fall backwards and all the shadows just faded away. I was barely breathing when they got me. My shoulder ached and hurt, but my clothes were fine. Moving my sleeve was a patch of skin turned scar white, a perfect handprint. 


This was decades ago. I have teenagers of my own and know they will make their own stupid choices. Yet I can’t hope that theirs are much different than mine. It’s late as I write this, my desk light the only light on and I see two faint points of yellow in the deep shadows across the room about six feet off the ground.
