I'm not exactly sure where to start, and I truly hate to bore you with stories of my upbringing, but I suppose that may give some context as to what made me into the monster I am today.

I could tell you my father was a drug addict who left for an eight ball when I was four and never came back. I could tell you my mother was absent through my childhood. I could tell you about the first love of my life who constantly rejected me. I could also tell you about all of the friends I had through my adolescence that I won over with parties and substances... I could tell you about my addictions, my broken body, a life altering surgery, and all of my heartbreaks and rejections, but I don't think any of that explains why I am the way I am, at least not entirely.

See this isn't your average scary story that you tell in the dark, there are no monsters out for blood, no secret government projects... No, This is something personal, this is about inner demons and the God that was never on your side. If you're expecting an epic story or a happy ending, this isn't it, I don't think. 

  
I struggled through my late teens and early 20's. Alcohol addiction was very present in my life back then. I know I used substances to cope with loneliness and a feeling of failing in life. I was unlucky enough to grow up in the social media generation, where I got to constantly see how wonderful everyone else's life was. While I never paid much attention to it, it was still a nagging feeling in the back of my mind that I wasn't good enough or I couldn't have those things, those dreams that everyone else seemed to have or be experiencing. 

  
For a brief period in my early 20's I did find some solace. I had a decent job, and I found what at the time I thought was the love of my life. We lived together in a crappy apartment and for the most part, things were good. We were together for about a year and while things weren't exactly perfect, I do recall feeling some sense of happiness and fulfillment. At about the year mark, we found out we were pregnant. While we weren't exactly financially stable, we ultimately decided that we we're getting jump start on the rest of our lives together and this pregnancy was a blessing. 

A few weeks passed since we found out about the pregnancy and then it happened... On a Sunday evening, on the tail end of the spring season, we decided we'd go for a walk through the neighborhood and enjoy some sunlight and fresh air. As we were leaving out the back door in the kitchen, I stopped for a moment realizing the trash was full and thought it'd be a good idea to grab it and take it out. She left out the back door and said "I'll see you in the ally." I was only twenty, maybe thirty seconds behind her when I made my out and I walked into the most terrifying thing that I had seen in my life... A homeless man had a knife to her throat... I wasn't sure if he was trying to rob or rape her, but I reacted in that moment as many men would. the bag of trash slipped through my fingers and before I knew it I was on top of the man, having shoved my girlfriend to the side. She escaped unscathed thankfully, I however did not... I was stabbed, the blade made direct contact with one of my ribs. I got a few other minor cuts as well, but nothing detrimental. With the adrenaline pumping, I hadn't even noticed the damage I sustained, and I didn't realize the damage I was causing either. I repeatedly slammed this mans head into the concrete. 

In no time at all first responders were on the scene, the man was hauled away to the hospital as was I. I got some stiches and was let go free and clear, that man however will spend the rest of his days drooling on himself in a mental facility, which in my opinion was well deserved. So all was well in the world, right? A nice neat bow was put on the action hero's story and we walked away happily and more in love than ever, right? 

  
Here's the thing, all of those action movies that show the hero walking away happily with their girl in tow are a complete lie. She was terrified and stressed over what had happened, so much so that her doctor believes that's what caused the miscarriage. I had constant nightmares that haunted me for years after that encounter as well. Things were so bad for her mentally speaking, she didn't feel safe, even in our apartment. When I'd leave for work, my best friend who worked from home would come over and be there with her. What I didn't expect was to come home early from work a few months after the incident and find my best friend in bed with the love of my life. 

Of course after that discovery, I kicked her out. She moved in with my best friend and eventually married him. They now have three kids together and live what seems to be a peaceful and happy life in the suburbs of Boulder CO. 

  
So anyways... I sat there for months, lonely, drunk, upset and a touch suicidal. Everyday was a waking nightmare that I couldn't escape from, and on the few occasions I could sleep, all I dreamed about was the day I smashed that fellas head into the concrete repeatedly. After a good couple months of suffering, I quit my job, moved out and decided it was time for me to get my life back on track... and the first step to that was going to rehab and getting some therapy. 

  
After a month of inpatient treatment, I was back out in the world. I moved in with my mom and step dad, found a crappy temp/ entry level job, bought a crappy car and attended AA meetings everyday. The next few years of my life were pretty quiet, I stayed on the grind, kept to myself and stayed sober and paid off my debts. Eventually I caught some raises, made a name for myself professionally and even got a motorcycle. Life had been tough up to this point, but I felt like I was finally making some positive strides financially. The only downside to this self improvement grind was I lost the small handful of friends I had left due to my lifestyle changes and I was extremely lonely. 

In the midst of all of that though, something which at the time I thought was good happened. I never really knew my family past my grand parents on my moms side, but around the two year mark of my sobriety, my mom started to get in touch with distant relatives, cousins, aunts and such. In that time, my mom discovered her cousins daughter who was fresh out of college was looking for work. So my mom asked me if I could help her find a job with me. In no time at all I was conversing with my second cousin who I'd never known and I was able to get her an interview with my place of business. I really wanted to be sure she would succeed, so I met up with her the day before her interview at a coffee shop to talk about the role, the team, the work and how to say the right things and get hired.

(Now I know a lot of you won't understand this and I'm likely going to catch a lot of shit for the things I'm about to say, but bare with me... it's an important part of the story.) 

I walked into the coffee shop, and I saw my second cousin... and Admittedly, I was awestruck. She was hands down the most beautiful woman had seen at that point in my life. We really hit it off that night, we talked for hours and there was a lot of smiling and laughter. On my way home that evening, she texted me and said it was wonderful to meet and thanked me for everything and said that she was happy that I came into her life. The very next day she was hired and we struck up a beautiful friendship. She sat next to me in the office, we talked all day and I helped her move quickly through the basics and got her more involved with bigger and more difficult tasks. I was able to put her into hyper speed and get her everything I had going for me, raises and promotions in a fraction of the time it took me. 

We went out everyday after work. Sometimes we'd take a stroll through the near by park and talk for hours or we'd get some ice cream or bite to eat... and eventually the unthinkable happened... I realized I was falling for my second cousin. For obvious reasons, that didn't sit well with me and against my better judgement, I decided I needed to tell her how I was feeling. So one day after work, after sitting on it for a while, we got shakes and headed to the park, where I told her how I felt about her. To my surprise, she felt the same, however she thought it was weird, it wouldn't work and of course she had a boyfriend. At that time, we agreed to stay cousins/ friends and to never speak of this to anyone. 

  
Things were all well and good for a little while. We remained very close, and she actually encouraged me to get out there and start dating again. After a handful of terrible first dates, I found a woman who wanted to keep seeing me and that I wanted to keep seeing. I was with her for a few weeks and things were great... until life got complicated. I was still very tight with my cousin and she started to get jealous. I was doing things with this new girl that we had planned on doing together and our friendship began to grow into something toxic. Me, not being one to keep my mouth shut and trying to hang on to the one friend I had, called my cousin out on the jealousy... and then it happened. without thinking of the potential outcomes, I called her out by text... Half an hour went by before I finally got the response I desperately wanted deep down... she admitted she was in love with me and if I was willing to give it a shot, against all the odds, she would take that leap with me. 

  
We hung on to our respective partners to keep up a facade, We would each see our partners one day a week and go on an arbitrary date, never doing more than kissing them. The rest of the week her and I would spend every waking moment together. It was blissful, fun, romantic, sexy as could be and all around beautiful. 

After a month or so of keeping up our facades, we decided it was time to cut our respective partners loose. As far as our families would know, her and I were both just single and friends... that was the plan. So I cut my girlfriend loose on a Monday afternoon, I came to pick up my cousin feeling fresh recharged and happy that we were doing this. However... a few days later, she determined it was in her best interest to stay with her partner and let me go.

This was a huge a kick to the nuts for me. I let a good girl go for someone that was wrong for me in every possible way. I think the worst part of it was in the process I lost my only friend and obviously this wasn't something I could talk to anyone about either... So I wallowed in pain in misery again, had a few drinks and broke my sobriety. We professionally and personally went our separate ways and in a few months time, I was back to myself again. 

Thankfully things never slipped for me professionally, I caught a couple promotions along the way, upgraded my car and my motorcycle and life was feeling pretty darn good. Heck I even managed to make a few friends along the way as well! I mean I was still in pain over what happened, but everyday, things felt better and better. I even got back out there again and started dating. This time, things were a little more difficult. I went through what I swear was hundreds of first dates before I finally found the right girl. I stuck with this girl for about eight months before I realized, I wasn't really in love with her. I just simply wanted to be. I knew it wasn't right to keep this girl hanging on. So I did the right thing and I broke it off. 

  
Things kept going really well for me professionally and after a grueling five years, I had no debt, I owned my car and motorcycle outright, I had money in the bank, to the point where I could get a mortgage and finally move out of my parents house. I even had a good group of friends from work!

  
Then the beginning of the end started... and it started with a gal who was my direct report. I never thought much of this gal when I hired her and even for her first few months, I never gave her any thought. Then we started working late together, not just her and I, but the whole team of course. I started to notice that we clicked very well and while she wasn't the prettiest girl in the room at first, to me she slowly became the prettiest in the room. Things got heated between her an I pretty quickly and we found ourselves on a first date... and then a second, etc... It was a really nice relationship and she was a great person. After about a month of quietly dating, we took a week long vacation together in my little slice of paradise. This was actually the first vacation I took since I was child, so it was big for me. I felt like I found the right girl, professionally and financially, life was on track and I had a good group of friends and a mentor that had my back... and that's where I was terribly wrong. It was in that moment, sitting on the beach, smoking a cigar, listening to music, with my gal by my side a cold beer with a lime in it, in my hand that I felt like I was king of the world, I felt like I finally made it in this thing called life. 

  
We returned to work on a Monday, and when I walked in, I could feel every set of eyes in the office on me... and  let me tell you... it was a massive office! I instantly knew something was wrong, the folks I said good morning to in passing didn't even look at me... It was about 30 minutes into my day when a managing director came over to my desk and asked me to step into their office. Now I think you might suspect the office rumor mill had spread the stories of my love life, but as it turns out that wasn't the case... 

My long time boss and mentor had screwed up a relationship with a long time 500 million dollar customer of mine while I was out on vacation. Rather than accepting the blame for something she dropped the ball on, she pinned the blame on me and I never got the opportunity to defend myself . The consequences of her actions were, letting me go. 

  
I thought to myself that first week or two, I still have some money in the bank, my credit is great, I have no bills and I've got a place to crash, plus I've still got an awesome girlfriend. I also really made a name for myself in my industry. "I will get through this and be okay." 

I was so incredibly wrong about that... The first thing that went wrong for me, about two weeks after being let go was finding out that my girlfriend had a terminal sickness that would take her life shortly. We fought the good fight together and promised we'd stick it out to the bitter end... and she didn't. We stayed together another few months, and she broke up with me on New Years day. (I like to joke that I was a New Years resolution). I found out about a month later that she had passed away. 

The other problem at that time was no matter how hard I tried and how many applications I put in, I was never able to gain any traction with finding work. I didn't start working again until the time she had passed away. So over four months. In that time we were still together, I also started lying to her, I told her I had plenty of money, and that I was getting a massive wrongful termination settlement... and in truth, there was no wrongful termination, my boss/ mentor covered her ass beautifully. I spent every last nickel I had on treatments for her and medical bills. I destroyed myself financially trying to hang on to her and whatever moments we could have together until she decided to leave me. 

Unfortunately, the lines of reality started to blur... I started feeding my friends and family the same lies, that I was getting a settlement, and that I found work when I hadn't. I found in that time that it was easier to have everyone believe the same lies than try to lie to one person and constantly cover your tracks with them. 

Towards the end of January, I finally found work. It was a far cry from what I used to do and I certainly didn't want to make a career out of this new found job, but it paid well, and I needed that badly. I suppose it's a good thing though that I didn't dream of making a career of that job though. Because it didn't last more than two months. I was deemed to not be a culture fit. (I refused to go to church with the owner of the business and that made me not a culture fit).

  
So there I was, struggling once again. I made all of these big promises to the handful of folks left in my life that I was getting a big settlement and I continued to tell my parents I was working when I wasn't. God took my girl from me as well and I was still a mess over that. I had maxed out all of my credit cards, I only had a few hundred bucks left in the bank and when I was driving home one night from a friends, I hit a beaver... My car was drivable, but man was it jacked up! I couldn't afford to fix it either. I mean who hits a beaver? incredible luck, right? 

Right as I got down to my last few dollars, one of the thousands of applications I submitted got back to me and scheduled an interview... this was the first bit of hope I had felt in quite some time. They ended up offering me a good paying job that I graciously accepted, however I was in a dismal place financially, so I decided to sell my car and buy a beater and use the difference to live until my start date. Time came and went and a month later, I was drained again, but at least I started working!  
Now I realize just because I had a job that doesn't mean I was financially stable... and I was still lying to everyone in my life about my financial situation. My plan was to grind it out like I did before. work on repairing my credit, save some money and get life back on track, I knew eventually I'd have to come clean to my parents as well, but I didn't want to do that until I was in a better spot financially. As you can tell though... life for me has a funny way of going off the rails. The day I got my first paycheck was the day I met my current girlfriend. 

So... I'm not exactly sure where to take it from here, I suppose I'll just say... let me welcome you to the last four months of my life. I guess I'll start by saying, this girl... she's not like anyone I've met before. She's incredible, head to toe, inside and out. I mean if there ever was a perfect woman for me, she is it. I've had some great ones in the past, but they pail in comparison to her. (Sorry ex that passed away...) She's a little older than I am, and she has a toddler who I love as if he were my own. She inspires me to be a better person... which I suppose is why I'm here today telling you the whole ugly truth of the monster I've become over the years.  
Outside of how I feel about this woman, I should say she's in the midst of a messy divorce and financially she's going through a tough time. I caught onto that fairly quickly and started floating her some cash, and ignoring my creditors... I also saw she was in a hopeless place as a whole, and this is where things started going wrong. I never had to lie to her and repeat the same shit I've been telling others for the past year, but I did... I gave this woman false hope and... she loved me for it. I think the reason I've lied to her is because of a fear of rejection. I was afraid if she knew what I was going through, she wouldn't want to deal with that on top of her own issues... so I lied to her and told her I'd be there for her, that I would make everything okay and that we'd take on the world together. 

When I said all of that, I truly meant it. I didn't quite care about what would happen to me financially as long as she made it through. I said all of that while I had a job too. However after about a month of us being together, life fell apart for me again. The company I was working for lost a large client and they could no longer afford me and decided to let me go... My credit was still jacked up, maxed out cards, creditors calling every hour, etc... but at least I had cash coming in. As if things couldn't get worse, my parents kicked me out that same day I lost my job. They found out I had been drinking occasionally and they felt betrayed by that. (I've been responsible and I'm far from being an alcoholic these days... I know that sounds like probable BS, but I promise you it's not).

  
I was left with no choice, but to sell my beater car. I also ended up selling my motorcycle as well. I currently have negative twenty dollars in my bank account, all of my cards are maxed, I haven't been able to find work in months... and I let my girlfriend believe I have money to spare, that we could buy a house, get married... and that I have a new car... which she hasn't seen yet. I'm back to living with my parents, but they don't know the full truth... they think right now as I'm writing this in my room that I'm really working remotely, they also bought my faked documents stating that I do have my first payout from my wrongful termination coming in at the end of the month, and it's supposed to be substantial. My girlfriend is starting to not believe my lies, she's seeing I'm less and less reliable and it's caused a significant rift in our relationship.   
I know when I go to see her, if I can even manage to find a way there, if I don't show up with that car, it's likely going to be over. I also know when my parents find out how broke I really am and that I've been lying this whole time to them, they'll likely kick me out. 

I wanted this story to get out there... before it's to late for me to tell it. In my opinion, as I'm sitting here writing this, the real monsters in this world are us, average every day humans who get beaten down, backed into a corner and who sometimes make wrong decisions or bad choices out of love, longing, loneliness or loss. While I partially consider myself to be a human monster for my actions through the years, I don't think God or creator or however you want to refer to the universal existence should escape without blame. I never wanted any of this. All of I've wanted in my life is to feel loved and to give that love back, to live a simple life. I've tried to find myself, do the right things, I've tried to love and I've tried to be on the receiving end of love and have failed miserably every time. Rather than looking out for your humans, you let them suffer, let things outside of their control, but possibly in yours destroy them repeatedly. You say sin is part of our freedom of choice, but why do you take away all of our options other than sin? I'm not without fault here, but God, you sure as shit aren't either. 

The last hope I have to save this relationship and have a life worth living is a lottery ticket for tonight's drawing. I'm certain that last fractional bit of hope won't pan out, but you know what? Prove me wrong God. 

As someone who's become a pathological liar in the past year, that thing that was always coming, but never arrived... tomorrow. Tomorrow is arriving, it's knocking on the door and the only one here to answer it is me. God ain't by my side, never has been, nor is anyone else. I see myself clearly for the first time in my whole life, I was never God's warrior or chosen son. I'm just another lost soul doomed to suffer without getting a second glance. 

So there it is, the whole ugly truth, all of the wrongs I've done and all of the wrongs done to me. There may not be a scary blood thirsty monster involved in this story or some great conspiracy, but it is dark, it is twisted and out of all the stories out there, I assure you it's the most real and least hopeful story you'll hear today. 

Wish me luck...
