Two years ago, someone I was really close to took his own life. He was staying with his mom at the time.

From my understanding, she had found him, much to her horror, hanging from the ceiling fan in his bedroom. A toxic amount of opiates was found in his system — far more than a fatal dose. 

That part didn't surprise me, we both frequently did heroin together in the past and I’m the only one who left that life behind 

Both me and his mom tried to help him recover too, but he never changed. Some people never do.

So I cut him out of my life and moved on, and before you say I’m a shitty friend, let me just say: I tried so hard to help him.

I gave him money (which was stupid in hindsight), tried to convince him to go to rehab, and even let him stay with me for awhile when his mom kicked him out after she found him passed out with a needle in his arm.

I probably shouldn’t have let him move in because things got really bad between us after that.

Not only would he never pay rent, eat all my food, steal money from me, bring his sketchy friends around without asking, totally trash the place, or refuse to get a job, he also started getting really hostile towards me.

He had a way of constantly putting his problems on me, and never took accountability. Everything was always my fault somehow, as if he wasn't the one who introduced me to drugs in the first place.

I mean, we went way back; all the way to middle school. The first time I smoked pot was in high school with him.

The first time I snorted oxycontin, you guessed it, was with him. He had always been a terrible influence on me.

It was only a matter of time before our habits became rampant and uncontrollable, and he was always there to push me into trying something new. It took me way too long to wake up and realize I was better off without him.

Things reached a boiling point when I came back to my place just to find him in my living room smoking black tar with three other people. I was livid and immediately lost my shit.

He knew that I was clean and wanted nothing to do with any of it, but he didn’t care.

I told everyone to get the fuck out or I would make them, and he started getting in my face about it.

So I kicked his ass and kicked him to the curb, told him he could come back the next day and find all his belongings outside the front door. Honestly, I still don’t regret it.

That was the last I saw of him. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel some sense of guilt but you can only do so much for somebody before you start sinking with them.

Everything I did for him, and he just spat in my face for it. It still pisses me off how ungrateful and self-centered he was.

I found out from his mom a year later that he was dead. She called me on the phone, and that was a really bittersweet conversation.

I always liked his mother, she’s really kind and probably had to put up with so much more than I had to. Still, there was a melancholic connection we shared in someone close to us both passing away.

There weren't any tears or words of remorse; only apathy and facts. Almost like she knew this was bound to happen eventually.

“Phil's dead, John.” Is all she put out.

“Oh… Okay.” Is all I could respond with.

When he crosses my mind, I’m reminded of one of the last positive memories we shared before our relationship turned sour.

We were at our usual smoke spot we liked to hike to in the woods, talking about making a badass rock band together.

It bothers me sometimes, what could’ve been with us. We could’ve been friends to the end.

My girlfriend tells me not to blame myself, and she’s probably right.

Part of me misses him, I think. Or maybe I just miss the person I knew before he fell off.

Still, life goes on.

I got home late tonight, another long day at work. I noticed something when I glanced at my front door.

There were light scratches. Some near the handle and some near the bottom of the door.

I lived in a somewhat rural area with my girlfriend, not totally in the middle of nowhere but there was a decent amount of space between houses that was covered by thick forest. Halfway between rural and suburban.

My house had fallen victim to a brown bear trying to get in through the garage door before. So I shrugged it off as strange but inconsequential.

I hadn’t thought that something else might’ve been trying to break in. Obviously whatever attempted this didn’t succeed so it didn’t matter.

Feeling thoroughly annoyed that I would have to cover that up, I walked through the door, closed it behind me, and locked up. The second I set my keys on the rack, I heard an inconsistent knocking.

It went *knock,* half second, *knock-knock,* one second, *knock,* one second, *knock-knock-knock.*

Looking through the peephole, there was nothing there. So I checked my ring app, still nothing.

I thought it was weird, but maybe I was just hearing things. I settled in and went to make myself dinner.

My girlfriend wasn’t home tonight so I was cooking some pasta by myself when the same knocking rhythm happened again, but this time on my kitchen window. The blinds covered what I would’ve been able to see on the other side.

I was agitated and threw the curtains open to peer through. There was still nothing there.

I wasn’t interested in whatever game someone was trying to play with me. I had a long day at work and I was exhausted so I was already in a bad mood.

I went out the kitchen door and shouted, “Whoever’s doing that, *fuck off*. If you wanna try me, I got my gun right here.”

No response, the area was silent, save for the usual sounds that encompassed the woods around my house.

I went back inside, locking the door, and nothing else happened. I ate dinner, watched some TV and fucked around on my phone.

That’s when I saw a notification pop up on my phone, it was from him.

“Hey”

Weird, I thought. It might’ve been his mother, but this number shouldn’t have even belonged to him anymore.

I mean, I forgot to delete the contact info but it’s not like he could’ve paid his phone bill from beyond the grave. I tried to ignore it, somewhat freaked out.

Then a few minutes later a string of multiple heys lit up my screen.

I just texted “What the fuck??”

“What are you doing?” The response said.

“Is this Francine?” That was his mom.

I didn’t get an answer to my question, just another four texts that read “What are you doing?”

Maybe it was just someone else who picked up the number and dialed mine by mistake, but deep down I knew how unrealistic that would be. Did someone find his phone sometime after his untimely death and hacked into it to mess with me?

Not likely.

Try as I might to ignore it, a few minutes passed and the number started calling me on repeat.

Eventually I reluctantly picked up and paused, there was no sound at first.

“Hello?” I said,

The silence continued for a few moments until the sound of the wind blowing through trees became apparent. It seemed to fade in and out.

Then I started to hear muttering. There was no way I could make out any of what was being said, the sound was way too low for me to hear it.

The phone hung up, to my surprise. I was left wondering what just happened.

Before I had time to fully contemplate anything, there was a loud banging on my front door. No rhythm or sequence this time. Just *BANG BANG BANG* sequentially.

I nearly pissed my pants but got it together. I ran to the front door with my gun as the pounding continued.

As soon as I looked through the peep hole, the noise stopped and I saw that there was *still nothing.* That’s when the creaking of my kitchen door gripped me in a fear I had never known before.

I slowly turned to look, and it was wide open.

I went into panic mode. I ran into my room with my gun and locked the door.

Having some protection made me feel a little safer at least, but a dreaded thought creeped into my mind. *What if my gun doesn’t make a difference?*

My phone buzzed again.

“What are you doing?” Three more times.

Then another buzz. It was a picture this time.

It was in the middle of a forest, pointing upwards as the sun was fading into the night sky.

My phone buzzed again.

“Open the door John” was texted fifteen times.

I was panicking, the only thing I could think of was to call the police.

“911, what’s your emergency?” said the person on the other line.

“Please, help me. There’s somebody in my house, my—” I was interrupted.

*“What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?”* My blood ran cold.

I was so sure that I called 911, but when I looked down at my phone it said *his* name.

“Open the door John. Open the door John. Open the door John.”

All of a sudden, outside my bedroom door, a scream bellowed.

“OPEN THE DOOR JOHN. OPEN THE DOOR JOHN. OPEN THE DOOR JOHN.”

There was a repeated pounding conjoined with this.

“What the hell do you want from me, Phil? I thought you were dead!” I yelled in response, but received no answer.

Everything fell silent. Broken by the sound of my phone buzzing again.

“Lol, sorry! Lol, sorry! Lol, sorry! Lol, sorry! Lol, sorry! It’s not really me. It’s not really me. You’re not alone.”

The silence continued for a brief time until the rhythmic knocking made a return. It started happening consistently every few minutes.

A few times throughout the knocking, he, or it, made a single blow to the door so heavy that I was sure the hinges would come off.

An unnatural and unhuman scream emitted while my locked door rattled back and forth. This high-pitch screech went on for roughly eight minutes.

No pause for breath, or sense of strain. Just continuous ear-piercing frantic screaming.

Whatever is on the other side of my bedroom door is not human. It’s not my old friend that I parted ways with. It’s something else.

Or maybe it is him. Maybe he came here to get back at me for abandoning him in his time of need.

He sent me another text. “I’m so scared…” three times, followed by another picture that appeared to be deeper into the forest. I swear I recognize this area, but it’s too dark to make anything out.

The violent screaming and shaking of my door stopped with a sudden halt, back to the metrical knocking on a dime, but not without other horrifying shit.

A periodic *knock* half second *knock knock* one second *knock* one second *knock knock knock* was disrupted by a series of three loud thuds\*.\* A bright light seeped through the bottom of my door, its shape contorted and morphing every second as though it were alive.

The muttering returned. They wanted to tell me something. They wanted me to open the door for them.

Not only that, there was music. Where exactly it was coming from was my best guess. But I recognized it, although it was difficult to make out at first.

The tune was the outro of one of the songs we recorded years ago, we titled it “Eternity in Delirium” (or E.I.D. for short). But it was reversed and looping again and again, tormenting me with my past.

This went on for hours. Here’s a [video](https://youtube.com/shorts/ab8YesbpuXs?si=eY4f9uUh5yLlrNo4) I took sometime into the madness.

As I’m typing this out, all of the noises have reduced back to the same rhythmic knocking. The lights under my door are still there. I haven’t received another text yet.

I don’t know when this is going to stop, if it ever does. Any time I’ve tried to call for help, whether it be my girlfriend or the police or somebody, all of my calls are redirected to his fucking number.

He doesn’t want me to call anyone for help. He wants me to feel alone and helpless.

My girlfriend is staying with her mother tonight to help her parents plan a vacation. She’s supposed to come back tomorrow morning.

But I can’t call her. I’ve already tried so many times. I just get diverted to the same sound of muttering surrounded by the wind in the trees.

I need to warn her, I need to get out of this situation somehow. I thought maybe jumping out of my bedroom window would be a good idea, but it’s so dark outside and surely he’s going to follow me wherever I go.

I won’t be getting any sleep tonight, I don’t even know if I’m going to make it until morning. Maybe this will only last through the night and I can make a run for it to my car and make it to my girlfriend before it's too late.

If I make it through the night, I’ll update again.
