**I Should’ve Never Opened Safe Deposit Box 13….**[]()

**I had always thought I had felt the absolute epitome of boredom before in my life. Waiting hours in a line, nearly falling asleep in college classes for 4 years, and long plane rides in the middle seat all tested my resolve to its breaking point. None of those have come close to what I’ve been through so far at my new job here at the local bank in this sleepy Minnesota town. The freezing temperatures during Winter always cause a chunk of the population to fly to the warmer climate of the South. Without all those folks who make the most of the tourism seasons, this place can slow worse than molasses in January. I had almost been wishing that I was back at my old chaotic convenience store job when a single customer changed everything. He came to make a deposit, but it wasn’t money he was looking to deposit.**

**In the fall, I got a call from someone at the bank and met to talk about a full-time position. They told me that if I just got my foot in the door as a teller, then who knows, I could eventually start lending and could make a name for myself in the area with businesses and homeowners. In hindsight, I should’ve seen the slow pace coming from a mile away. Every time I had gone in before, there was never a line, never a need for even more workers. Yet here I was offering to join the crew.**  

**The start of my new job was pleasant. I got along with my coworkers and felt welcomed with open arms. Everyone was eager to teach me what they knew and offer their own personal tips that they swore were better methods than what other people tried. It was nice, and even though the pay wasn’t the best, it still felt like a marked upgrade for a job.**

**Fast forward a few weeks and it was time for the holidays. Every day that went by became a little slower than the last. It wasn’t unusual for just about every business in the area to have dreadfully slow winters as a large portion of the older population migrated South to Arizona or Florida. I could already feel the boredom creeping in between the handful of deposits or withdrawals and setting up the few Christmas decorations we had at our disposal. Then he walked in.**  

**I was eyeing the clock, watching the secondhand tick by as though it took the gears herculean strength to do so. I heard the familiar clicking of the front doors opening and put on my best customer service face as I turned to face them. A man in a tan, withered jacket and washed-out blue jeans entered the building. He had a long scraggly beard that looked like it had been red decades ago but now had the color of dirty snow. He was carrying a box in his hands. It was wrapped in plain brown wrapping paper, like the most unimpressive Christmas gift you could ever find under a tree.**

**“Good morning, sir! How are you doing today?” I said, trying my best to hide the boredom in my voice.**

**“Good morning…Elias.” He said, clearly reading my nametag. I always hated when customers did that, but something about the way he spoke had me gloss over that feeling. His voice was a stark contrast from the clean, well-to-do lobby of the bank. It sounded gravelly but it came out sharp, like he was calculating every word before it came out of his mouth, but his vocal cords were fighting against age. “I’m doing quite well young man. I’m hoping that you could help me with an important transaction.”**

**“Of course I can help sir. What can I do for you today?”**

**“I want to make a deposit. More specifically, I would like to make sure this package finds its way to the safe deposit room. You think you can handle that, Elias?” His eyes bore into mine as he spoke. He put the package down carefully onto the counter and flashed a wide grin which featured several missing or blackened teeth. “I really do appreciate the help.”**

**I had never seen this man before. I had only worked here for a month and some change though, so I assumed that this man was simply just an older gentleman who lived somewhere up in the bluffs who didn’t need to come into the bank very often. It was however, a little unusual for anyone to be dropping off some sort of package. I studied the box for a moment before looking back up at the man. His gaze was now firmly fixed on it, almost like he expected it to sprout legs and bolt at any moment.**

**I gave him a customer service smile that didn’t quite reach my eyes. “Sir, are you a customer with us? Do you have a safe deposit box here set up? I’m new here still, and I don’t think I’ve seen you before. I just want to make sure I can identify who I’m working with for future reference.”**

**His brows furrowed slightly as though I had slighted him in some way.**

**“I understand the trepidation young man. Bank security is extremely important after all.”  He slid a hand into his back pocket and pulled out an old dark leather wallet that was nearly ready to fall apart from years of usage. He found a card and handed it to me. His driver’s license was slightly overdue for renewal. I saw a picture of the old man with a more vibrant beard and more white teeth in his smile.**

**“Thank you, sir. I’ll just look you up in our system to verify that you have a deposit box and we’ll get this squared away.” I said, as I typed in the unfamiliar name.**

**When the page finally loaded, there was a lot of information missing. No address, no phone number, no email. Just one savings account with about $400 in it. I didn’t think too much about the limited scope of business he did with the bank, but it was strange that he would have a safe box with us without much personal information. I glanced back and forth between the screen, his I.D., and the man himself. The look of growing impatience was written into every nook and cranny on his wrinkled face. Rather than sit here and pry for more personal details about the strange man, I took him at his word, just as I did with a lot of the people in town.**  

**As I began to hand his I.D. back over, his hand snatched the card out of my hand faster than I had expected. The skin on his fingers looked dry and his skin lost almost all color, resulting in a sickly gray flesh color. It was cracked and wrinkly, like his heart was refusing to pump blood to his extremities.**

**I grabbed the keys to the safe deposit box room and prepared to lead the man over to his destination, grabbing his package to carry it over with us.**

**“Wait!” He croaked. “Be careful with that box young man. Its contents are very…fragile, and I don’t want anything bad to happen while you’re lugging them around. Didn’t anyone teach you to be careful with other people’s things?”**

**“What’s in this sir?” I replied, not fully able to mask my annoyance with the situation. “Should I be worried that this is a bomb or something? Banks and bombs really don’t mix too well.”**

**“It’s not a bomb! Why would I want to blow up the only place I know that can keep the contents of that box safe and sound? As for what’s in it, well….” His voice drifted slightly as he put all his mental energy towards picturing what he was depositing. “It’s really none of your business young man, but the deposit is just as important as where it’s going.”**

**“You don’t really have to tell me sir.” I answered back, slightly confused by his wording. “Would you feel better carrying it?” As I finished asking him, his features softened and he didn’t seem as tense. I did my best to shrug off the weird interaction. A lot of the customers that come through the lobby have always been grumpy elders of the community, so I always tried my best to not let it get to me.**

**I carefully put the box back down and the man gingerly whisked it back into his arms like a child and his favorite stuffed animal. I ushered him over to the door that divided the back of the teller stations and the lobby, and he followed me right up to the safe deposit door, his feet dragging on the carpet with every step.**

**I used my key fob on the door sensor and with a single beep, the door was unlocked. The first thing I always noticed about that room was how cool and humid the air felt. It was rare for anyone to go into the room in general, so the heater would only come on when it was needed to keep it from getting to refrigerator temps. The bleak white interior didn’t do anything to help that cold feeling. The room was small since we served a more rural community. There were about 150 boxes total, all of various sizes along each of the walls.**

**Once the door was open, I allowed the old man in and he walked towards his box. It’s policy at our bank that we aren’t supposed to know what our customers store, so I stood outside the door with my back facing him while he opened safe 13.**

**It only took him a minute, but I could sense how giddy he felt while he fumbled with the lock and key. I’ve never met any customer that mumbled along with every movement he made and every movement of the door of the box. More so than even those weird mannerisms, I was surprised that he managed to fit that entire package into the safe. Considering the things he might’ve already had in there, I thought putting a whole box in might be too ambitious. I had an inexplicable desire to look and see if the box could indeed be swallowed up entirely into the safe. As discreetly as I could, I turned my head so that my eyes could peer over to where he was standing.**

**Box 13 was about waist height and he was bent over at the midsection with both of his arms completely inside and his face only a couple inches outside the opening. He had a look of immense satisfaction, and I thought I could hear the faint sound of the box being crushed. The scene reminded me of forcing medicine down a dog’s throat. I was frozen in disbelief for a moment, unable to look away until the thought of being caught breaking protocol entered my head. I returned to my original position and shortly after, I heard a hollow thud and the turn of a key.**

**“Ok, young man.” He said, as though a weight had been lifted off of his shoulders. “That should do it. Thank you for your assistance.” He walked past me out of the room, I let him back out into the lobby, and without another word, he strode through the open space and back out the door into the cold like he was gliding on ice.**

**As procedure, our bank logs any activity going in and out of that room through our computer systems. When I opened the program and looked at all our catalogued visits, I saw that he had indeed been in before. Even though this was the first time I had seen him, his name was recorded 80 times in the last 5 years of saved data.**

**Part II**

**I tried for a long time to wrap my head around what I thought I had seen in that room. My brain could not accept how strange the interaction had been. Those safe boxes were usually just used for small packages or manilla folders with social security cards or personal documents. Yet, the old man was able to get his gangly arms and his box completely engulfed within the safe. Over the next couple of weeks, I did my absolute best to avoid that room. If someone came in and requested to go in, I would pretend I couldn’t find my fob or would ask a coworker to take care of it because I had another task to do. Walking past the door would give me a strange anxious feeling, like I saw something I shouldn’t have. Even just picturing the scene again was enough to get my pulse racing. There was no way to get it out**

**I thought about talking to a professional about my experience and feelings, but it seemed less like a path to mental comfort and more like a one-way ticket to a psych ward. So, I kept my mouth shut and just put as much space as I realistically could from me and that room, hoping this fear would subside eventually. I knew deep down that it was really just a feeble attempt to calm my nerves. I knew that just as he had done so many times in the past, he would come back one day. He’d need my help with another deposit.**

**I was trying my best to look productive at my teller station facing the open lobby of the bank one day. Sorting through the day’s paperwork and balancing the inventory of cash in my drawer, when that click of the doors interrupted me.**

**Even though it had been a month since this job had gone from boring to stress-inducing, my mind’s first thought every time the doors swung open was that it was going to be that elderly man walking right up to my desk and I’d have to face the room again. It was like my mind was anticipating it, attempting to prepare itself to go back. This time, I was partially correct.**

**A pale man, pale as the driven snow, was sauntering through the lobby like the cream linoleum floor was wet cement. His coat enveloped his small frame like a cloak and his boots reminded me of clown shoes on his feet.**

**As he slowly reached the teller desk, his face was easier to see. His facial hair was unkempt and white with visceral stains around his mouth, leading to his chin. His teeth were almost non-existent, a handful of them were still stuck in his mouth but were shades of yellow and black. His skin seemed to simply be nothing more than a thin mute-colored sheet covering his boney frame. My hands were instinctively gripping my side of the teller counter until my knuckles were white. Even with all these differences, I could tell this was him. The man who's very thought has tormented me for weeks. What I got wrong in my assumption about his return was that he had no package with him.**

**It took me several seconds to address him once he arrived in front of me. I couldn’t find the strength to take my wide-eyed stare off of him and relax my muscles.**

**“Good morning sir.” I finally muttered. “What can I help you with today?”**

**The strange old man had very labored breathing and coughed into his hand a few times.**

**“I’m looking to get into my safe deposit box young man.” His voice was weak and sicky. It took all of his energy to have this one conversation with me.**

**“Okay sir. You’re here to make a deposit?” I asked, already knowing the answer.**

**He nodded his head a couple of times rather than say anything. I could feel myself start to sweat and my legs felt like they had turned into wet noodles. I looked around to my coworkers to see if I could pawn this off to them, but nobody else was nearby to help. I would have to go into that room again.**

**I led Mr. Wright around to the door that led behind the counter and towards the safe deposit box room. Every step I took to get closer made my heart beat just a little harder, a little faster.**

**I took the key fob out of my pocket and held it up to the sensor. My muscles clenched as I heard the beep and opened the door. The room was cold and sterile. Nothing at all seemed to be out of the ordinary and yet, my eyes would not leave the small, engraved piece of metal that said “13”.**

**“Wait, you said you were making a deposit right? What exactly are you depositing? You didn’t bring anything with you today.” I said, as the old man shambled over to his safe, key already in hand.**

**He turned to look at me and once again nodded. He held out his hand with the key in his palm, tempting me to get close to the source of my anxiety.**

**“Sir, I’m not really supposed to handle your safe or anything you’re putting inside. It would be a breach of our confidentiality policy here.” I explained, hoping this would squash any desire he had for me to help.**

**The man did not move an inch. He persisted in holding his key towards me, determined to break me.**

**“I think you’re more curious than you let on. I’m not strong enough anymore, but you can help me again.”**

**I looked at him, then the safe box. This old man looked like he might keel over right in front of me if his business here lasted 5 more minutes. He was just an old and physically weak person who needed a hand. I had helped so many others like that at the bank before, why shouldn’t I now? I’d be cautious with the safe box and do this quick. I would get to see what has been making me nervous for weeks, if there’s anything at all. It could finally be a way to get peace.**

**I took the key from his dry, cracked hands. It felt warm in my hands. I crouched in front of box 13 and inserted the key into the lock. My mind raced with possibilities about what could possibly be wrong with this box. The anxiousness transformed from terror-filled fear to a macabre sense of wonder, like the gross curiosity you might feel when you drive by a car accident. The lone thoughts in my head being about how impossible the situation should be, but I had the urge to know more.**

**It turned easily and I took a step back to allow the man to open the door. Without any of the excitement of the previous visit, he opened the box, peeked inside, and turned to me one last time.**

**“I am too weak to deposit anymore. You’re going to help me inside and lock the door. It will call to you now. I’m sorry.”**

**Before I could respond, he turned back to the safe, ducked down, and started to force his body inside of the box head-first. He was so small and frail but it seemed impossible that he could fit inside entirely, yet the box physically adapted to his size. He stuck his arms in first in a Supermanesque pose. I could hear a sick squelching coming from inside with slight cracks mixed in. I tried grabbing his midsection so I could pull him out and I managed to get the back of his head and shoulders back out slightly. They were spotty with some sort of saliva-like fluid, but I couldn’t get him completely out.**

**“Box 13 needs its deposits young man. If I can’t get one, I’ll be one. You’ll feel its pull.” He spat out through the disgusting liquid. He was holding on to something with the last of his strength and wouldn’t let me get him out. “Help..me..inside..”**

**I looked inside the box over his head, and my heart sank into my stomach. The inside of the deposit box was a dark maw. It was an abyss with sharp and dull teeth covered in moisture haphazardly placed throughout the interior. It emanated a putrid warm odor that was the antithesis of the sterile cleanliness of the bank.**

**The poor old man’s arms had been broken by crushing pressure of whatever this ungodly thing was. They were shattered in multiple places, unnaturally held together by what was left of his soft tissue. They resembled grisly tent poles, designed to be pulled apart with a central string keeping them together. I felt vomit attempting to wretch itself up my throat.**

**“Deposit…me” The he whispered, almost like a prayer to God’s own ears, but it seemed God wasn’t listening. The only one to hear his pleading was me.**

**My head was pounding while I held the frail man for a moment. What would the police think when they saw what happened to him? Why did he want this? Why does this thing need deposits? All these thoughts swirled like a hurricane, but it didn’t matter. I had become a passenger in my own skin and my body acted on its own will. Compelled to obey the man’s wishes to my horror.**

**His frame made him light and easy to maneuver into the gaping mouth. The smell coming from the safe was a vile mix of metal and bile. He didn’t move at all as I continued to force him inside. The squelching of flesh continued, occasionally interrupted by tearing and cracking of organs and bones.**

**As his waist reached the metal edges of the safe, I looked inside and saw how the vicious devourer lubricated the old man bit by bit before crushing segments into viscera which could be sent into whatever laid further down.**

**As his torso was crushed, one of his legs had fallen out of the safe, detached halfway up his femur. The saliva had covered the gaping wound and most of the leg. It felt warm and slimy. Without even a second thought of consideration, I picked up the limb and forced it in, making sure to deposit all of him.**

**The last remnants of the deposit disappeared into box 13 after a minute or two. Every bit of him had been devoured, clothes and all.**

**There were ichorous trails of crimson blood flowing down from the entrance, something that I knew I would have to clean up to avoid anyone knowing anything about the box. I avoided looking at it again. I shut the door of the safe and locked it, knowing the deposit was satisfactory for now.**

**I quit my bank job immediately after all this happened. There was no way I could be employed in a place where that thing resides, but I took that cursed key with me just the same. As much as I never want to set foot in that building again, I know that the old man had thought the same thing at one point.**

**It’s been a month since I was in that freezing room at the back of the bank. I felt horribly about what happened to that strange old man, but he was a deposit that had to be made. The first week or two were fine but in the following days it became tougher to get out of bed, I would lose my appetite at the sight of food, and concentrating on tasks gave me migraines. The past few days have shown me my new reality. I see that grotesque mouth in every dark corner every night. Eating food makes me imagine the sounds of a body being crushed. The only thoughts that aren’t bringing me bouts of agony are ones about satiating box 13. If I deposit more flesh, it may spare me a while longer.**

**I had a chance to escape its grasp after I caught glimpse of the strange box, but something kept me from running from the bank. I should’ve listened to that part of my mind. There isn’t a single day that goes by that is boring anymore. Tomorrow I’m going to make my own deposit.**
