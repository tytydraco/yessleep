I’ve always had a strange relationship with the internet. I guess it started as an escape—a place where I could get lost in something, forget about real life for a while. But I’ll be honest, the deeper I’ve gone, the less comforting it’s been. I like the idea that there are mysteries hidden out there, little corners of the web that no one talks about, secrets tucked away for people who know where to look. But sometimes, the internet has a way of staring back at you.

It was a Friday night when I first found *The Forgotten Ones*. I was alone, as usual, clicking my way down the rabbit hole of obscure forums and hidden websites, looking for something interesting, something mysterious. I was reading about an ARG (Alternate Reality Game) that had apparently popped up and disappeared almost immediately, leaving only cryptic, half-finished posts behind. People on one forum were saying it was a hoax, while others claimed that the “players” had gone missing after the game shut down. It was late, and I knew I should go to bed, but something about the whole thing hooked me.

A link popped up in one of the threads, posted by an anonymous user whose profile looked brand new. It didn’t have a description—just a simple URL and a warning: *“For the truly forgotten.”*

It felt like an invitation. I don’t know why, but I clicked it.

The page loaded slowly, as if it hadn’t been touched in years. The design was old-school—grey background, plain black text, and a strange, almost uncomfortable silence. No autoplaying ads, no social media icons, nothing that suggested it was a modern website. Just a plain header at the top that read: **"Welcome to The Forgotten Ones."**

At first, I thought it was just some abandoned forum, one of those dead sites people used to use before social media took over. But there was something about it that kept me there. The posts on the main page were strange—short, disjointed sentences with no context, like bits of conversation ripped out of time. Names were displayed beside each message, but they weren’t typical usernames. They were titles, almost like roles or statuses. Names like “The Lost Echo,” “Wanderer #9,” and “Memory Faded.”

Curiosity got the best of me, and I clicked on one of the threads. The title was simple: **"I can’t remember who I am."**

The post itself was even stranger:

*“I’m not sure how long I’ve been here. Time feels… different. If you’re reading this, please help. My name is… no, I don’t have a name. But I need someone to remember me.”*

There was a reply underneath it, from another user called “Shade of the Forgotten.” They responded simply, *“Welcome. We’ve been waiting.”*

I felt a chill run down my spine. I’d seen a lot of weird stuff online before, but this was different. It didn’t feel like a joke or an ARG. It felt real, like someone had poured their actual thoughts, their fears, onto the page.

I clicked through more threads, each one somehow darker than the last. One was titled *“Can you see me?”* The original post was just a single line:

*“Please, if you’re out there, just let me know you can see me. I don’t want to be forgotten.”*

There were replies beneath it, from other users with names like “Echo,” “Lost,” and “Wanderer.” Their messages were cryptic, almost like fragments of a conversation that had been cut up and shuffled around. *“I can’t see you, but I feel you,”* one said. Another replied, *“We’re all here, but no one remembers.”*

It was unsettling, but I couldn’t look away. I’d stumbled onto something that felt… wrong, but in a way that I couldn’t quite define. It was like I was peeking into the thoughts of people who had somehow fallen through the cracks of reality, left to linger in this forgotten space.

After what felt like hours of scrolling, I noticed a pinned post at the top of the page titled **“Rules of The Forgotten Ones.”** Something in me hesitated before clicking it, but I couldn’t stop myself. The page loaded, and a list appeared—simple, but oddly desperate.

1. Do NOT post real names.
2. Do NOT share photos of yourself.
3. Do NOT ask for others’ locations or share your own.
4. You must never close the forum while a post is still loading.
5. Do not attempt to contact users outside of this forum.
6. If you begin to feel watched, do NOT interact with anyone in the real world.
7. Do NOT attempt to remember others for too long.

The final line at the bottom of the post was written in all caps: **"FORGETTING IS SAFETY."**

My stomach twisted as I read the rules, my mind racing to make sense of them. Some of them made no sense at all, like the one about feeling watched. But one thing was clear—the people here were serious, deadly serious, and I was beginning to understand why.

I should have closed the site, I should have clicked away and forgotten all about it. But a message notification popped up as I hovered over the tab to leave. It was from someone called **Echoed Voice.**

*"I see you found us, Sam."*

The screen went cold, and I felt my pulse quicken. How did they know my name? I hadn’t registered, hadn’t shared anything personal. I glanced around my room, as if the answer might be hiding in the shadows.

I tried to tell myself it was a coincidence, that maybe I’d left my name somewhere online, and they’d found it. But it didn’t feel like a coincidence. It felt like someone had reached through the screen and whispered my name just to get my attention.

I typed a quick response, my fingers trembling.

*“Who are you? How do you know my name?”*

The reply came instantly, almost like they’d been waiting for me to ask.

*“You’ve already forgotten, haven’t you? We all forget, eventually. But I remember you.”*

I felt the hair on my arms stand up. I was scared, but at the same time, I was hooked. I wanted to know more, even though every instinct told me to close the browser and walk away.

After that night, I couldn’t stop thinking about *The Forgotten Ones*. The messages haunted me, echoing in the back of my mind whenever I was alone. I began spending hours on the forum, scrolling through post after post, reading the disjointed fragments that felt like messages from another world.

Each day, the posts seemed to grow darker, more personal. I started seeing threads with titles like, *“Why do I remember you?”* and *“The ones who watch.”* They felt like warnings, but I couldn’t turn away.

Then, one night, I received another message from Echoed Voice.

*“Are you still here? I can’t see you, but I feel you watching. Don’t forget me, Sam.”*

The words left me feeling uneasy, but I responded anyway, ignoring the part of me that knew I shouldn’t. I wanted to ask how they knew me, how they seemed to know what I was doing, but all I could type was:

*“I haven’t forgotten.”*

The screen flickered, and a new message appeared, this one from an account I hadn’t seen before—**Shade of the Forgotten.**

*“Be careful, Sam. The more you remember us, the more we can see you. The more we see you, the harder it is to leave.”*

For the first time, I felt real fear. It was as if something was warning me, like I was teetering on the edge of something I couldn’t understand.

But instead of closing the site, I stayed.

The next night, after tossing and turning for hours, I found myself sitting in front of my laptop, staring at *The Forgotten Ones* forum. I hadn’t planned on visiting it again. In fact, all day, I’d been telling myself to just forget about it. But as soon as the sun went down, the curiosity crept back in, insistent, pulling me back like a gravitational force.

This time, as the page loaded, the site seemed different somehow. It was as though the colors were just a shade darker, the shadows around the text a bit deeper. It was probably my imagination, but it unsettled me nonetheless. And the forum seemed… quieter. There were no new posts, no new responses. Just the same eerie, fragmented messages from the night before.

I forced myself to click on the pinned post labeled *“Rules of The Forgotten Ones.”*

The list was the same as I’d remembered, but now the rules felt more like warnings, almost pleading. The final line, **"FORGETTING IS SAFETY,"** seemed to stand out, almost glowing, as though trying to urge me to heed its advice.

Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I needed to understand this place, to figure out why it existed and why it had this pull on me. So I started reading the posts again, combing through every message, every cryptic fragment, searching for something that would make sense of it all. But with each post, I only seemed to sink deeper into confusion.

After a while, I noticed one thread that I hadn’t clicked on before. It was titled, *"The Ones Who Remember."*

I clicked on the thread, and the screen took longer than usual to load. For a moment, I thought my computer had frozen, but then the text appeared, stark against the dark background.

*"If you’re here, you’re one of us now."*

That was the entire post. But it felt like it had been written specifically for me. Like whoever had posted it knew I was there, staring, unable to look away.

Underneath the message was a reply from someone I hadn’t seen before—a user named **“Watcher.”** Their message was simple but unsettling.

*“Remembering is dangerous, Sam.”*

My breath caught. I didn’t remember ever giving my real name, and I certainly hadn’t registered on the site. How did they know who I was?

I could feel my pulse quicken, and my hands started to sweat. The cursor hovered over the browser’s exit button, but I couldn’t bring myself to leave. I needed answers. So I typed a response.

*“Who are you? How do you know my name?”*

The response came almost immediately, as if they’d been waiting.

*“We know all of you, Sam. You’re the one who’s forgotten us.”*

I stared at the screen, feeling a chill run down my spine. How could I have forgotten something I’d never known in the first place?

I was about to type a reply when another notification popped up. It was a private message, from **Echoed Voice.**

*"Do you want to remember, Sam?"*

The question hung in the air, heavy and foreboding. Something about it felt wrong, but the need to know more overpowered the fear gnawing at me. I typed out a single word:

*“Yes.”*

The screen flickered, and for a moment, it went completely black. When the page reloaded, I found myself staring at a new thread. The title read: *"The Rules Are For You."*

The post inside was a list—a new set of rules. I scanned through them, my stomach twisting with each one.

1. You must not tell anyone about *The Forgotten Ones.*
2. Do not attempt to delete this forum or remove it from your history.
3. If you see someone familiar in a post, do NOT reach out to them.
4. Do not keep any lights on when reading the forum at night.
5. You must not look away if someone speaks to you here.
6. Always remember: the closer you get, the harder it is to leave.

The final rule was different, written in a strange, almost frantic font that stood out from the rest.

1. **Do not try to remember us.**

I sat back in my chair, feeling a wave of nausea. My hands were shaking, and I realized I was gripping the edges of my desk so tightly my knuckles had turned white. None of this made any sense, but I couldn’t deny the creeping feeling of dread growing inside me.

I reached for my phone, half-considering calling someone, anyone, just to break the silence around me. But then I remembered Rule #1: *You must not tell anyone about The Forgotten Ones.*

The rational part of my mind told me it was a stupid rule, probably just part of the elaborate prank someone was playing. But there was another part of me—a deeper, quieter voice—that warned me not to break it.

Hours passed, or maybe minutes—it was hard to tell. I kept scrolling through threads, each one revealing something new, something worse. Every post seemed designed to burrow into my thoughts, each reply a thinly veiled warning or invitation.

Eventually, I stumbled upon a thread simply titled, *"Faces We’ve Forgotten."*

I clicked on it, almost out of reflex, and a new page loaded, showing a list of messages, each one more cryptic than the last.

*“I don’t remember his name, but I remember his face. He watches me from the screen, just a shadow now.”*

*“I tried to forget, but he won’t let me. I see him in the reflections, watching, waiting.”*

*“They come for us when we remember too much. Do not let them see your face.”*

I felt a chill crawl up my spine. The words were starting to blur together, each post a distorted echo of the last. The more I read, the harder it became to shake the feeling that I was being watched.

And then I saw it. A post written by someone named “Silent Witness.” The name seemed familiar, like a half-forgotten memory, something buried in the back of my mind. The message was simple:

*“They’re with you now, Sam.”*

My vision swam, and for a moment, I felt dizzy, like I’d just stepped off a moving train. How could they possibly know? I was alone in my room, the door closed, the lights dim. But the sense of being watched had grown stronger, a suffocating presence that seemed to fill the air around me.

In a panic, I closed the laptop and stumbled back from my desk, breathing hard. The room was silent, but I felt as if someone were right behind me, just out of sight.

And then my phone buzzed.

I snatched it off the desk, my heart pounding. The notification was from an unknown number. I hesitated, staring at the screen, half-tempted to just turn the phone off. But curiosity won out, and I opened the message.

*"Why did you leave, Sam?"*

It took me a moment to process the words. I hadn’t told anyone about the forum, hadn’t mentioned it to a single person. So how did they know?

Another message popped up before I could even think of a reply.

*"You can’t leave, Sam. We won’t let you forget."*

I wanted to throw the phone across the room, but instead, I turned it off and tossed it onto my bed. My mind was racing, a storm of fear and confusion that wouldn’t settle. Was this just some elaborate prank? But no one knew about the forum—not a soul. And the messages, the names… they felt real, like whispers that had followed me back from the darkness of that site.

I tried to avoid the forum after that night. I really did. I told myself it was nothing, just a weird corner of the internet that had gotten under my skin. But over the next few days, the strange sense of being watched only grew stronger. Every time I walked into a room, every time I glanced out a window or caught my reflection in the mirror, I felt it. A presence, just out of sight, just on the other side of my vision, watching, waiting.

Finally, unable to resist, I opened the laptop again and went back to *The Forgotten Ones*. As soon as the page loaded, I felt a sick sense of relief, like I’d come home after being away too long. I hated that feeling, but I couldn’t deny it. Something about the forum had claimed me.

The first thing I noticed was a new message notification. It was from **Watcher.**

*"Welcome back, Sam. You’re starting to remember."*

I didn’t reply. I couldn’t. The words on the screen felt like a trap, like something that would pull me deeper if I so much as acknowledged it. But then another message appeared.

*"We’re with you now. Do you feel us watching?"*

My hands were shaking, and my vision blurred as the room seemed to close in around me. And then I felt it—a cold whisper on the back of my neck, a brush of air that sent a shiver down my spine.

I turned, but there was nothing there. Just my empty room, dimly lit and silent. But as I looked back at the screen, I realized that maybe, just maybe, I wasn’t alone anymore.

I didn’t sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt the shadows creeping around me, closing in, whispering things I couldn’t quite hear. And whenever I managed to drift off, I’d be pulled awake by the feeling that someone was there, hovering just outside my vision.

The next morning, I went through my day like a ghost. Work was a blur, conversations were meaningless noise. I caught myself glancing over my shoulder, checking every corner of the room. It was ridiculous, and I knew it—no one was there. No one could be there. But the feeling never left.

As soon as I got home, I couldn’t resist. I opened my laptop and typed in the URL for *The Forgotten Ones*. The page loaded slowly, and I noticed that familiar sinking feeling as I took in the dark background and the eerie, broken conversations. It was like stepping into another reality, one where nothing made sense and the only rule was to forget.

My message box had several new notifications. I hesitated, my finger hovering over the touchpad, but my curiosity won out. I clicked.

The first message was from **Echoed Voice.**

*“It’s time, Sam.”*

That was all it said, but the words felt ominous, like a quiet threat. I swallowed hard and checked the next message. This one was from **Watcher** again.

*“The rules are for your protection, Sam. Breaking them brings us closer.”*

My heart raced as I read it. Breaking the rules? I hadn’t broken any—at least, not intentionally. But then I thought back to the rules I’d read. No sharing your real name. I hadn’t done that, right? Not intentionally, anyway. No sharing locations. And yet… they knew my name. They’d known I was there.

A third message popped up, interrupting my thoughts. This one had no sender name attached, just a single word:

*“REMEMBER.”*

I felt an icy chill race through my veins. The urge to respond was overwhelming, but I didn’t know what to say. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but every word I typed and deleted felt wrong, inadequate.

Finally, I settled on a single question:

*“Who are you?”*

A response appeared almost instantly, as though they’d been waiting for me.

*“We are the Forgotten, Sam. We are the echoes left behind when the world looks away.”*

The screen flickered, and my room seemed to darken. I could feel my pulse pounding in my ears as I read their message over and over again. The Forgotten… echoes left behind. What did that even mean? But before I could type another question, another message appeared.

*“When you remember, we can return.”*

Something about those words made my blood run cold. Return? To where? To here? I closed the laptop, desperate to break away from the screen, to regain control over my thoughts. But even after shutting it, the words lingered in my mind, twisting into something darker.

The following nights were worse. Every time I tried to sleep, I’d feel that same suffocating presence, the shadows whispering, moving just out of reach. And the strange sense of being watched grew stronger. I’d catch glimpses of movement in my peripheral vision, but whenever I turned to look, nothing was there. My reflection in the mirror seemed different, somehow… not quite right. Like I was being replaced piece by piece by something darker, something that knew me too well.

After another restless night, I woke up with a new message notification on my phone. I didn’t recognize the number, but the message made my stomach turn.

*“It’s almost time, Sam. Don’t look away.”*

I tried to ignore it, to push it from my mind. But it was impossible. The words echoed in my thoughts, haunting me even as I tried to go about my day. By the time I got home that evening, I was a wreck—physically, mentally, emotionally.

Without even thinking, I opened *The Forgotten Ones*. It was like my hands had a mind of their own, my fingers moving across the keyboard as though they were being guided by someone else. The page loaded, and I was met with a new post at the top of the forum.

The title read: **“The Ritual of Remembrance.”**

The post itself was short, just a few lines, but each word seemed to resonate deep within me.

*“To remember is to let them in.”*

*“To remember is to give them form.”*

*“Only the Forgotten can return.”*

I felt a shiver crawl up my spine. I knew it was insane, but a part of me believed every word. Something dark and forgotten was reaching out to me, trying to pull me into its world.

The next line made my heart skip a beat.

*“If you’re reading this, Sam, it’s already too late.”*

My screen flickered again, and this time, the entire forum seemed to shift, as though the text and images were rearranging themselves. I watched, transfixed, as new threads appeared, each one titled with a single word: **Remember. Remember. Remember.**

One by one, I clicked through the threads, each one showing strange, distorted images—faces I didn’t recognize, scenes I couldn’t place. But somehow, they felt familiar, like half-formed memories clawing their way back to the surface.

As I stared at the images, something strange happened. My vision began to blur, and I felt a strange tingling at the back of my head, like someone was whispering directly into my brain. I blinked, trying to shake the sensation, but it only grew stronger. The images seemed to shift and pulse, warping into something darker, something more alive.

And then I heard it—a voice, faint and distant, echoing through my mind.

*“Sam, do you remember us now?”*

My breath caught. The voice was familiar, but I couldn’t place it. It was like someone I’d known a long time ago, someone I’d forgotten. But I didn’t want to remember. I could feel that instinctively, deep down. Whatever was waiting for me in those memories, it wasn’t something I wanted to see.

I tried to close the laptop, to turn away from the screen, but my hands wouldn’t move. It was as if they were frozen in place, held there by some invisible force. The voice continued, growing louder, more insistent.

*“Let us in, Sam. We’ve been waiting so long.”*

My vision blurred, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. I wanted to scream, to break free from whatever was holding me, but I couldn’t. I was trapped, helpless, as the shadows closed in around me.

And then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. The voice faded, the images on the screen returned to normal, and I found myself staring at the plain, dark background of *The Forgotten Ones* once again.

I took a shaky breath, my mind racing. I needed to stop this. I needed to get away from the forum, to delete it, to erase every trace of it from my computer. But as I reached for the power button, a new message popped up on the screen.

*“You can’t leave us, Sam. We’re with you now.”*

The days that followed were a nightmare. Every time I left my laptop closed, a part of me felt lighter, safer. But at the same time, the whispers, the presence… it was like a pressure building up inside my mind. It felt like something was clawing at the inside of my skull, urging me to go back to the forum.

I tried to resist it. I went to work, kept busy, and even slept with the lights on—anything to feel normal again. But it was only a matter of time before the itch returned, too powerful to ignore.

One night, I gave in. With shaking hands, I opened the laptop and typed in the URL. The site loaded slowly, like it was struggling to reach me, pulling itself through an unseen darkness. When the page finally appeared, the first thing I saw was a new notification.

It was a private message from **Watcher**.

*“Do you remember us now, Sam?”*

I swallowed hard, my eyes glued to the screen. I didn’t know what to type, didn’t even know if I should respond. But there was something about the question that felt deeply unsettling, like they were asking more than they seemed to be.

Before I could decide, another message popped up.

*“You’re close, Sam. Close to remembering. And when you do, we’ll be right here, waiting.”*

I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw the laptop across the room, to delete the site, to break free. But instead, I did the only thing I knew how to do—I kept reading.

The forum was darker than I remembered. Each thread seemed to pulse, the words taking on a life of their own. One of the posts, titled *“The Price of Remembering,”* caught my eye. My fingers moved toward it on their own, clicking the link.

Inside was a single message:

*“The more you remember, the less of you remains.”*

The words echoed in my mind, reverberating through me like a warning. It felt like a plea, like someone trying to tell me to stop before it was too late. But I was already in too deep. Whatever was happening, whatever this place was… I needed to understand.

I scrolled down, reading replies from users with names like *LostEcho* and *SilentSteps*. Each one told a story of remembering something, someone, they had lost, only for that memory to consume them.

*“I remembered his face, his voice. But when I looked in the mirror, it wasn’t me staring back anymore.”*

*“I couldn’t let him go. I couldn’t forget. And now, he’s here, whispering, taking pieces of me every night.”*

The stories blended together, each more chilling than the last. I could feel my pulse quicken as I read, the words weaving themselves into my mind, clawing their way into my thoughts.

And then I saw it—a reply at the bottom, written by **Watcher**. My breath caught as I read his words.

*“Sam, if you’re reading this, it’s already too late. You’re one of us now.”*

The feeling of being watched was unbearable now. Every time I glanced in the mirror, every time I looked at my reflection in a window, I felt it—a presence, lurking just beyond the glass. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was no longer alone, that something was with me, watching, waiting.

One night, as I was brushing my teeth, I caught a glimpse of something strange in the bathroom mirror. My reflection was… wrong. It looked like me, but there was something off about the eyes, something darker, almost hollow. I blinked, and the image returned to normal, but the unease lingered.

I stumbled out of the bathroom, heart racing. The shadows in the room felt alive, shifting and pulsing as though they were reaching for me. I knew it was insane, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me from within the darkness, waiting for me to remember.

That night, I barely slept. Every time I closed my eyes, I could hear the whispers, faint and distorted, like voices from another world. They were calling to me, urging me to remember, to let them in.

 

The next day, I woke up to a new message on my phone. It was from an unknown number, but somehow I knew it was them.

*“You can’t forget us, Sam. We’re with you now.”*

I felt a chill run down my spine as I read the message. They were relentless, clawing their way into my life, into my thoughts. I tried to ignore it, to push it from my mind, but the whispers only grew louder, more insistent.

That night, I opened *The Forgotten Ones* again. I didn’t want to, but it felt like I had no choice, like something was pulling me back to the forum.

A new thread had appeared, titled simply *“The Return.”* I clicked on it, my heart pounding.

The post inside was from **Watcher**.

*“When you remember, we can come back. We’re waiting, Sam. So close now.”*

I felt my hands tremble as I read the words. The presence in my room seemed to grow stronger, pressing down on me, suffocating. And then, I heard it—a voice, faint and distant, echoing through the darkness.

*“Sam… let us in.”*

My breath caught in my throat. The voice was familiar, like something I’d heard a long time ago, something buried deep within my memories. I tried to ignore it, to push it away, but it was relentless, clawing its way into my mind.

And then I saw it—a shadow in the corner of my vision, shifting and pulsing, growing darker with each passing second. I turned, but there was nothing there. Just the empty room, silent and still. But I knew I wasn’t alone.

The next few days were a blur. The whispers followed me everywhere, their voices growing louder, more insistent. Every time I looked in the mirror, I saw glimpses of something dark, something that wasn’t me. It was as if my reflection was changing, becoming something else.

One night, as I was brushing my teeth, I saw it again—the figure in the mirror, staring back at me with hollow, empty eyes. I froze, unable to look away, as the figure seemed to move, shifting closer, closer, until it felt like it was right behind me.

I turned, but there was nothing there. Just the empty room, silent and still. But I knew that something was there, lurking just beyond my vision, waiting for me to remember.

That night, I dreamt of shadows, of faces I didn’t recognize but somehow knew. They whispered to me, calling my name, urging me to remember, to let them in. When I woke up, I felt a strange, heavy presence in the room, like something had followed me back from the dream.

I stumbled out of bed, disoriented, and caught a glimpse of my reflection in the window. For a moment, I didn’t recognize myself. My face looked… wrong. Hollow, empty, like the face of a stranger.

And then I saw it—a faint shadow in the reflection, hovering just behind me, watching.

The next time I opened *The Forgotten Ones*, a new message was waiting for me. This one was different, written in a strange, almost frantic font that seemed to pulse and shift as I read it.

*“Remember us, Sam. Remember what you took from us.”*

I stared at the words, a deep sense of dread settling over me. What had I taken? What were they talking about? But the memories were hazy, like fragments of a half-forgotten dream.

And then, slowly, pieces began to surface. Faces, voices, memories I couldn’t quite place. They were people I’d known, people I’d loved, but somehow… forgotten. I didn’t understand how, didn’t understand why, but I knew, deep down, that they were the ones calling to me, the ones reaching out from the darkness.

They wanted me to remember, to give them form, to let them return.

The screen flickered, and a final message appeared.

*“You can’t escape us, Sam. We’re with you now. Always.”*

I closed the laptop, my heart pounding, and looked around the room. The shadows seemed to shift, pulsing with a dark, malevolent energy. I could feel them pressing down on me, surrounding me, waiting.

And then I heard it—a whisper, faint and distant, echoing through the darkness.

*“Sam… it’s time.”*

 

The shadows were closing in. I could feel it, creeping along the walls, moving in the periphery of my vision. Every time I tried to ignore it, it only grew louder, more insistent. The voices in my head, the whispers from the shadows—they were everywhere now.

It started with little things. A flicker at the edge of my vision, the feeling of someone behind me, even though the room was empty. But then it escalated. One night, I woke up to find the curtains in my bedroom drawn open. I was sure I had closed them before going to sleep. I got up and checked the windows, half-expecting to find someone standing outside, watching. But there was nothing—only the darkness of the night, the quiet hum of the city outside.

Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong, something was watching me.

That’s when I saw it again. In the bathroom mirror.

I’d been brushing my teeth, my mind racing with a thousand thoughts, when I caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye. My reflection… was different. At first, I thought it was just the lighting, but the longer I stared, the more I realized something was very wrong. My face—my own face—looked… unfamiliar. The eyes were hollow, like empty sockets, and the skin appeared stretched, as though someone had been wearing my face like a mask.

I turned sharply, my heart racing in my chest, but when I looked back at the mirror, everything was normal. The reflection was mine again, as if nothing had happened. I was shaking, my mind on the edge of panic, but I tried to tell myself it was just a trick of the light. That’s what I told myself. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

The nightmares had become more vivid, more real. In my dreams, I was never alone. There were faces, eyes staring at me from the darkness. And the whispers—they were louder now, clearer. Sometimes, I would hear my name called in the night, soft but insistent, as if someone was just on the other side of the wall.

But when I would wake up, no one was there.

The presence was real, though. I could feel it—the weight of it. The air in my apartment felt heavier, thicker, like something was pressing down on me. The shadows had taken on a life of their own, twisting and moving when I wasn’t looking. Every corner seemed to hide something, a figure waiting, watching.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to know what was happening. I had to confront whatever this was. So, I logged back into *The Forgotten Ones*.

The screen flickered as the page loaded, and I was greeted with a new message. It was from **Watcher**, as always.

*“You’re close, Sam. So close now.”*

I didn’t hesitate. I clicked the message. My heart pounded as I read it.

*“It’s time to remember, Sam. Time to open the door. The more you remember, the more we return. We’re waiting, Sam. All of us.”*

I stared at the screen, trembling. I knew, deep down, that something was about to happen. Something I couldn’t stop. And then, the next message appeared.

*“Do you remember us yet, Sam? Do you feel it? The shadows are closer now. You can’t escape.”*

I shut the laptop, panic rising in my chest. But I knew it wouldn’t do any good. They were already here, already inside my mind. I could feel them.

It wasn’t long before the encounters started to get… physical.

I woke up in the middle of the night, unable to breathe, my chest constricted as if something was pressing down on me. I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. The room was suffocatingly still, but the air felt thick with something cold and unnatural.

And then I heard it.

A whisper.

It was barely audible at first, but it came from the corner of the room, just behind me. My heart raced as I strained to hear it. The voice was faint but unmistakable. It sounded familiar, like someone I had once known, but the words were distorted, twisted.

*“Sam… remember us…”*

The voice was closer now. It was almost as if the whisper was in my ear, hot breath against my skin.

I spun around, but the room was empty. No one was there.

Except the shadows.

They were different now. They moved, twisting and shifting, as if something was hiding within them. I watched in horror as the shadows seemed to stretch toward me, dark figures rising from the floor, creeping closer and closer.

In the corner of my vision, I saw a face—familiar, but wrong. The eyes were hollow, sunken, as if it had been staring at me for a long time. I couldn’t look away. My body was frozen in place, unable to move as the figure seemed to approach, its mouth forming a silent scream.

Suddenly, I was jolted awake, my heart pounding in my chest, the sweat dripping down my face. I was back in my bed. The room was still. Silent. The shadows were gone.

But I knew. I knew they were still there.

The next few days were a blur. I couldn’t focus on anything. Work felt like a distant memory, and I was too consumed with the constant feeling of being watched. Every corner I turned, every mirror I looked into, there they were—those eyes, staring back at me, hollow and empty.

It was happening. The memories were coming back. Slowly, but surely, they were returning. Faces I couldn’t place. Voices I couldn’t identify. The shadows were growing stronger, their presence invading every moment of my life.

I couldn’t escape it. The forum, the shadows, the whispers—they were all I could think about. And the more I remembered, the stronger they became.

One night, I finally gave in. I logged into *The Forgotten Ones* again. This time, I didn’t hesitate.

The message waiting for me was chilling.

*“You’ve remembered, Sam. You’ve opened the door. We’re here. We’re with you now.”*

I stared at the screen in disbelief. The words were like a weight on my chest, suffocating me. And then, the screen flickered.

And I saw it.

A face.

It was my face, but not. The eyes were hollow, the skin stretched too tight. The figure on the screen grinned at me, and for a moment, it felt like it was reaching out of the screen, toward me.

I screamed. But no sound came out.

I turned away from the laptop, my breath catching in my throat. The shadows were closing in around me now. I could feel them, pressing in from all sides. They were here.

And then I heard it, loud and clear, echoing through the room.

*“Sam… it’s time to remember. It’s time to join us.”*

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move. The shadows had consumed me, had taken me. I was lost in them… Now, a part of them.

I closed my eyes, and I [remembered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLkYT7yWpKg).
