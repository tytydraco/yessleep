**No wordy intro this time, there is something big coming. I have them scared. While I get the final parts together, I'd like to share some correspondence from a victim of NuMind, transcribed exactly as written, though with the names changed.**

**Stay vigilant, stay hungry, and STAY AWAY from any NuMind tech that's still floating about. Not everything got recalled.**

Testimony 2: "Jack"

Hi Ian,

I saw your request for testimonies on the forum, and I wanted to give mine. I was a beta tester for the NuMind mind patch, and I've included my paystub and instruction leaflet in the envelope as proof. I hope you don't mind me sending a letter to your PO Box instead of emailing, but I don't use technology unless I have to any more.

The advert to be a tester kept flashing up on my social medias, I suppose they use there [sic] algorithms to find the right people. Apparently being a recently made-redundant 59 year old man with memory problems makes me the right person, or maybe they just knew I'd be ~~vunrable~~ vulnerable. I was foolish either way and signed up.

The computer made the forms really easy for me, filling in all of my details so that all I had to do was hit the "okay" button. The instructions came the next day in the post, along with a map to the testing place and a date and time and what I could expect on the day. They asked me not to drink before (6 years sober!) and I made my way over.

They sat me down in the lab and put a shiny sticker on the back of my neck, and it had a series of wires linked up to computers that some scientists were looking at, and they put some electrodes on my head as well that they said would help measure my brain responses. I told them that they'd be lucky to see anything happen up there! but none of them laughed.

The first test was to try doing some puzzles with the patch on and compare it to a test I'd taken without, and I can tell you that it was wonderful. It was like having the brain I'd had as a young man, bouncing between thoughts and solving things with ease! I was having a terrific time.

After that a lady scientist asked me what I wanted from the patch, and I knew that it could help with my memory so I asked to see my wife Susan's face again. I wanted to remember her how she was you see, before she got sick, but for real and not just looking at ~~fot~~ photos. The lady smiled and said they could do that, and that I had to just lie back and do my best to bring her face into my mind. The scientists were tapping away for a minute and I was getting a bit upset because nothing was happening. And then suddenly they pressed a button, and there she was! Her face in my head as clear as day! and not just her face, but her voice too. I could remember her laugh, how she'd said my name, dates that we went on years and years ago that I'd completely forgotten, I could finally remember it all. I think I must have been crying (it was overwhelming you understand) and I reached out with happiness and said "Susan" because I had her back!

The lady scientist said something like "Can you feel her with us Jack?" and I said "Yes" because it was like having her back after all these years! But then one of the scientists said "Algorithm 1" or something similar and pressed a button and suddenly she vanished! Like the memory had been turned off. And I said "No, bring her back!" and one of the others said "Too much, trying ~~agolr~~ algorithm 2" and my mind lit up with her again! But something was wrong this time, because it wasn't Susan. Or it was her, but she was behind me back where I couldn't see, and it wasn't memories any more. It was like she was in the room, actually her, but just behind my shoulders. They had me strapped down, I should have mentioned that, and so I couldn't turn but I said "Is that you?" But it wasn't just her! Others were there too. People, moving about, and it was like when you know someone is impatient behind you in a queue and you know they're there like a presence! Like you have the sixth sense for a person being behind you! And they were saying something I couldn't hear...

I tried twisting around because she was saying things she'd never said and I know my memory is bad but there was a difference between remembering something I'd forgotten and being made to remember something that wasn't real, and these weren't real memories! She was saying things like "they've stolen me!" and "they're hurting me, please help!" and I asked them what they were doing. "theyr'e pushing through" the glasses one said, and suddenly it got even worse. Susan was gone, and in her place was a flood of memories that weren't mine at all. So many people and places I'd never seen, strangers calling me names like Daniel or Lucy, a terrible one where I was lying in a hospital bed with all these people in suits around me asking me to sign something. The patch thing was feeding me a chaotic jumble that hurt! hurt to experience. I must have been howling like a maniac because the lady hit a button and it all faded away but I was still making all kinds of noise because of it all. So then the glasses scientist said that he was "engaging the sedative subbutine" or something, and all at once it seemed okay, like the panic just left.

After that they tidied me up and apologised, but I said it was okay because I did feel okay. They said to keep the patch on for a day, and I did, and I honestly don't feel so bad about it. That being said, it's squiked me out about technology now, the static or something makes me get headachey. I'm okay though, and I'm only writing because you said you were looking for experiences and I thought I could help. My friends have said that I seem a little different, they've been acting off with me, but I think they're maybe just jealous that they gave me an extra thousand for putting me through all that and they're not looking for volunteers any more.
Hope your investigation goes well!
