*Collecting = stealing, by the way.*

I haven’t been sleeping much lately.

My hands typically don’t stop shaking. 

Every time I close my eyes, I dream of the collection. Eighty human eyes floating in preservative fluid, staring back at me from their glass containers. And I know, with sickening certainty, that Jessica intended mine to be number eighty-one and eighty-two.

*The perfect pair.*

We met at Mercy South, where my mom was recovering from cataract surgery. Jessica was her ophthalmologist - brilliant, the nurses whispered, a rising star in ocular microsurgery at just thirty-two. I can still remember the first time those amber eyes locked onto mine, how something primal inside me wanted to look away but couldn’t. Like a rabbit trapped in a predator’s gaze.

"The human eye is the most perfect mechanism in existence," she told me that day, her fingers sketching the layers of the retina on a notepad. "A living camera more complex than anything humans could build."

I asked her to coffee after my mother was discharged. Six months later, we moved in together. That’s when the strange behavior began.

I’d wake in the middle of the night to find Jessica hovering over me, her face inches from mine, studying my eyes in the darkness. My heart would pound as I pretended to be asleep, afraid to let her know I’d caught her.

"You have such unique eyes," she told me once when I couldn’t hide my wakefulness. "The way the green fractals out from the pupil… like a nebula." Her thumb brushed my eyelid, and I flinched. "So sensitive," she murmured. "So full of expression."

That night, I dreamed she was peeling my eyes from their sockets like grapes.

When she moved in, I noticed the small wooden box on her dresser. When I asked about it, she traced her finger along its polished edge, and for a moment, her expression changed to something hungry.

"Just keepsakes from special cases," she said, then changed the subject.

I should have pressed harder. I should have looked inside. But there was something in her stare that made the words die in my throat.

The renovation of our basement was her idea. A climate-controlled space for my photography equipment, she suggested. I was suspicious - I’d mostly switched to digital and rarely needed a darkroom - but she insisted.

The contractors finished while I was away on a three-day wedding shoot. When I returned, Jessica seemed eager to show me the space, but an emergency at the hospital called her away. "Go take a look," she urged, those amber eyes gleaming. "I think you’ll love it."

The basement lights clicked on to reveal pristine white walls, stainless steel counters, and a large refrigerated case humming quietly in the corner. What confused me was the heavy padlock securing the unit.

"Safety protocol," Jessica explained that night. "Medical samples. Hospital regulations." When I asked for access, she smiled tightly. "Sorry, love. Liability issues. Only authorized personnel."

For weeks, I avoided the basement. 

Something about it filled me with dread. But one evening, Jessica got an emergency call from the hospital. A trauma case required her expertise immediately.

As she rushed out the door, her key ring fell from her purse.

Among her keys was a small silver one I’d never seen before. I found myself drawn to it, the small key feeling like a burning coal in my palm.

I crept down to the basement, heart pounding as I approached the refrigerated case. The key slid in perfectly. The seal broke with a soft hiss as I opened it. Cold air billowed out, carrying a faint chemical smell that burned my nostrils. 

Inside, arranged in perfect rows on glass shelves, were dozens of small acrylic containers. Each held a pale, round object suspended in clear solution. Each was meticulously labeled with dates, initials, and strange symbols.

Human eyes. Eighty of them.

I counted three times, hands trembling. Not pairs - individual eyes. Blue, brown, green, hazel, all staring blindly through their transparent prisons.

My stomach heaved. I barely made it upstairs and to the bathroom before vomiting.

The next morning, Jessica studied my face over breakfast with clinical precision. "You seem distracted," she noted. "Are you feeling alright? Your pupils are dilated."

I couldn’t meet her gaze. "Just tired. Big editing job today."

Her hand covered mine on the table, her grip slightly too tight. "You should let me check your eyes. It’s been a while since your last exam."

I pulled away, fighting the urge to scream. "I’m fine. Really."

Her smile didn’t reach those amber eyes. "If you say so. But vision problems can develop so suddenly. One moment you’re seeing perfectly, the next…" She made a popping sound with her mouth that sent shivers down my spine.

I barely ate. 

I barely slept.

Every moment in our apartment felt like being trapped in a predator’s den.

When Jessica left for work the next day, I searched her office with trembling hands. 

In her desk drawer, I found a small leather-bound appointment book. Flipping through it, my heart rate jumped as I saw patient initials that matched the labels in the refrigerated case. Next to some names were stars, others circles.

Most terrifying was finding my own initials, J.T., circled on a date. 

Sunday, April 20.

That night, I snuck away to Home Depot and made a copy of her key. The next day, when she went to work, I went back to the basement. 

The refrigerated case now contained eighty eyes. The newest container held a dark brown eye, labeled with that day’s date and the shortened initials of an elderly woman.

That was when I noticed the nearly invisible seam in the wall behind the case. My fingers found a recessed edge, and with gentle pressure, a panel slid aside.

Behind it lay a small chamber with walls covered in arcane symbols painted in what looked disturbingly like dried blood. In the center stood a circular stone table with eighty-two shallow depressions arranged in spiraling patterns.

On a shelf sat ancient leather bound books in languages I couldn't identify and a journal written in Jessica's precise handwriting. I photographed every page with shaking hands.

Later, huddled in my car three blocks away, I read her words with growing horror:

"The Convergence requires eighty two vessels of sight, one stolen from those who take their sight for granted. The final eyes must be a pair belonging to one who has seen the truth and still chooses sacrifice. When all are placed according to the pattern during the darkest night, The Watchers will finally see our world through these windows and grant their wisdom to the worthy observer."

Jessica had been planning this for years, before she met me, before she became a surgeon. The journal's earliest entries dated back to her teens, describing dreams of "beings of pure sight" who existed in dimensions visible only through "a circle of borrowed eyes."

I realized with sickening clarity that I was never her boyfriend. 

I was her final ingredient. 

My eyes, the eyes of someone who had discovered her secret, were meant to be the centerpiece of whatever ritual she was planning.

Then I saw it. Something I'd missed before. Jessica had made notes about the ritual location, mentioning that the circle of eyes needed to be "contained within walls that have never known electric light" for the convergence to reach full power.

On the final page was a hand drawn map leading to an abandoned barn. "The perfect vessel," she had written. "Untouched by modern light since its construction in 1879."

My blood ran cold. I knew that barn. It stood on the property where I'd grown up, where my grandparents had lived until they died ten years ago. Had Jessica chosen me because of this connection? Had everything been planned from the beginning?

Even more disturbing was the date she'd circled repeatedly: Easter Sunday, just three days away. Her notes referenced "the resurrection," "the rebirth of sight," and "the return of the divine through innocent eyes."

"The Messiah shall return through the windows of souls that have witnessed truth," she'd written. "Easter Sunday, when the veil between worlds is thinnest, He shall gaze through our offering and walk among us again."

That evening, I returned home, having convinced myself I could maintain the pretense of normalcy while forming a plan. Jessica brought dinner from my favorite restaurant.

"I've noticed you've been distant," she said, pouring wine that glowed blood red in the light. "I think I know why."

My heart nearly stopped. "You do?"

She reached across the table, her fingers brushing mine. "You've been in the basement. You've seen my collection."

The casual way she said it, like discussing stamps or vintage cameras, sent ice through my veins.

"What’s going on, Jessica? What are you really doing?" I whispered.

Her eyes shone with fervor. "Something magnificent. Something world changing." She explained her belief that Easter Sunday marked the perfect moment for the return of a divine presence she called "the True Seer" - an entity that would use the collected eyes as windows to enter our world.

"He needs pure vessels to see through," she said, her voice taking on an almost religious reverence. "Eighty one eyes arranged in the sacred pattern. The centerpiece must come from one who has witnessed the truth and still chooses to serve."

I gripped my knife so hard my knuckles turned white. "And my eyes? That's why you chose me?"

She smiled, the expression almost tender. "Your eyes will be the gateway for His return. The final vessels through which divinity will enter our world again." She reached across the table to stroke my cheek. "I chose you because of your photographer's eyes, so sensitive to light and composition. Perfect for the central position."

Her expression softened further. "I'm hosting a special gathering this weekend. An Easter celebration. With some of my colleagues who share my vision. It would mean everything if you would join us."

I understood immediately. The ritual. Her "colleagues" were surely fellow cultists.

"Where?" I asked, trying to sound merely curious.

"I was thinking somewhere meaningful," she replied. "Somewhere connected to you."

My mouth went dry. "Like where?"

"You’ve told me about your grandparents' old property before. The one with the barn. Wouldn't that be perfect? A return to your roots for this new beginning?"

I stared at her, mind racing. 

If I refused, she would find another way. Another place. 

But if I agreed...

"You know," I said, forcing enthusiasm into my voice, "that's actually perfect. I still have the key to the property. I could get everything ready."

Jessica's eyes widened with surprise, then delight. "You... want to help?"

I reached across the table, taking her hand. "I've been thinking about what you said. About The Watchers. If they've shown you things... I want to see too."

The lie tasted bitter, but Jessica's smile made it worthwhile. She believed me.

"I'll help with everything," I said. "Let me make the arrangements."

I spent the next two days preparing, but not in the way Jessica imagined. I drove to my old hometown, to the hardware store where I'd bought fishing tackle and BB gun pellets as a boy.

The owner, Mr. LeGrand, still remembered me. He didn't ask questions when I purchased gasoline cans, road flares, and timing devices.

"Doing some demolition work at the old place?" he asked casually.

"Something like that," I replied.

Next, I visited the barn, my childhood refuge now transformed into something sinister. I moved silently through the familiar space, placing the gasoline cans strategically, wiring the timing devices with trembling hands. My plan was simple: let Jessica and her cult gather for their Easter resurrection ritual, then trigger the explosion that would destroy everything, all while I watched safely from a distance.

I told Jessica I'd prepare the barn, insisting on doing it alone "to make it special." She was thrilled by my apparent conversion, never suspecting I was setting a trap.

As the sun began to set on Easter Sunday, Jessica's colleagues began to arrive. Five of them, all wearing crosses and medical pins, all with the same clinical detachment, the same unsettling focus on my eyes whenever they looked at me. They brought equipment, surgical tools, and the refrigerated case containing the seventy nine eyes.

The stone table was already positioned in the center of the barn. I had suggested it, claiming it would be more stable on the dirt floor than the rotting wooden planks. In reality, I'd placed the largest of the gasoline cans directly beneath it.

My plan was precise. The timing devices were set to trigger at 8:20 PM, starting with the explosives beneath the table, followed by the east wall thirty seconds later, and the final largest charge by the entrance at 8:21. I would excuse myself at 8:00 PM, claiming to get more wine from my car, and be safely behind the old oak tree when everything went up in flames.

I glanced at my watch repeatedly as I greeted each new arrival. 7:30 PM. The barn was filling with Jessica's colleagues, all with that same predatory gaze.

"Nervous?" Jessica asked, squeezing my arm as I checked my watch again at 7:45. She was wearing a white medical coat over a blue dress, like some perverse mixture of doctor and Sunday best.

"Just excited," I lied, feeling the weight of the backup detonator in my pocket. "When does the... ceremony begin?"

"Just after sunset," she said. "When light leaves the world, He will bring a new dawn."

That was perfect. I'd be long gone by then, watching from a distance as the barn burned. I nodded, forcing a smile, and turned to greet another guest.

At 7:55, I was pouring wine for an elderly colleague of Jessica's when someone stuck me with a needle. From behind. In my neck. The world spun, then went black.

I woke to find myself already strapped to a chair, my head throbbing. The barn was now lit only by candles and oil lamps, creating a circle of flickering light around the stone table. Disoriented, I tried to move but found my wrists and ankles secured tightly.

"He's awake," someone said.

Jessica's face appeared above me, her amber eyes gleaming. "I'm sorry for the rush, Jason. We couldn't risk you changing your mind."

"What time is it?" I managed to ask, my mouth dry with fear.

Jessica glanced at her watch. "Almost 8:00. We're ahead of schedule." She held up a syringe. "Local anesthetic. This part will be painless."

Panic flooded through me. Ahead of schedule. The explosives wouldn't detonate for another twenty minutes, and I was strapped to a chair in the middle of the barn. My entire plan was collapsing.

The needle pierced the skin beside my right eye, then my left. A cold numbness spread across my face. I felt hands holding my head steady, metal instruments touching my skin, all while I desperately tried to think of a way to escape.

I glanced frantically at the clock on the wall. 8:05 PM. Fifteen minutes until the first explosion.

"The procedure takes approximately seven minutes," Jessica said, pulling on surgical gloves. "Then we can begin preparations for the convergence."

I looked at the clock again. 8:12 PM. Only eight minutes until the first explosion, and I would still be in the chair when it happened.

"Wait," I gasped. "Shouldn't we wait until sunset is complete? For the moment when darkness fully takes the land?"

Jessica shook her head, already focused on her instruments. "The eyes need time to acclimate to the pattern. The ritual begins at sunset, but preparation takes hours. The resurrection must be ready for the stroke of midnight, when Easter Sunday meets Monday."

A male colleague checked his watch. "We should hurry. It's getting late."

I strained against the restraints as Jessica leaned over me. My gaze darted to the clock. 8:15 PM. Five minutes left. If I could just delay them somehow...

"I have a confession," I blurted out. "I'm scared."

Jessica paused, scalpel in hand. "That's natural. But unnecessary."

"Could I have a moment? A prayer or something?" I pleaded.

She exchanged glances with her colleagues. "Two minutes," she conceded. "No more."

8:17 PM. Three minutes until explosion. My heart hammered in my chest as I pretended to pray, eyes closed, silently counting the seconds.

"Time's up," Jessica said at exactly 8:19 PM. One minute left. My prayer had bought me precious seconds, but not enough.

She leaned over me, scalpel in hand. "Beautiful," she murmured, her face inches from mine. "Such perfect specimens."

I felt pressure, then a strange tugging sensation as she worked with terrifying speed and precision. I couldn't feel pain, but I could sense something being severed, could hear the wet sounds of surgical instruments. My vision in my right eye suddenly went dark.

"One," Jessica announced triumphantly. I heard the soft clink of my eye being placed in its container.

The world tilted sickeningly as I lost depth perception. Through my remaining eye, I glanced frantically at the clock: 8:19:45. Fifteen seconds.

Jessica's blood stained gloves returned to my face with mechanical efficiency. "And now the second," she said, her voice thick with anticipation.

I counted down in my head. Ten seconds. Nine. Eight.

More pressure. More tugging. Seven. Six. Five.

The strangest sensation of disconnection. Four. Three.

Then darkness. Complete and absolute. Two. One.

The explosion came just as Jessica announced, "Both vessels obtained!" The concussion rocked the chair I was strapped to, knocking it backward onto the floor. Screams erupted all around me. Heat washed over my face.

"What's happening?" Jessica shrieked, her clinical composure shattered.

As the chair crashed to the ground, the restraints on my right wrist snapped. My hand immediately went to my pocket, finding the backup detonator I'd planted there in case something went wrong with the timers. I pressed it, triggering the remaining explosives immediately rather than waiting for their timed sequence.

Another explosion, larger than the first, ripped through the barn. I heard the crackle of flames, felt the rush of heat as fire engulfed the dry wood.

"The vessels!" Jessica screamed. "Save the vessels!"

Somehow I managed to free my other hand and fumble with the ankle restraints. All around me was chaos, the sounds of people running, shouting, coughing in the thickening smoke.

I crawled away from the table toward where I knew the door would be. Eighteen paces forward, then six to the right. I had practiced this route countless times as a child, playing blindfolded games with my cousins.

"Stop him!" Jessica screamed somewhere behind me. "He's ruining everything!"

I heard her frantically gathering the containers, trying to save her precious collection as another explosion tore through the eastern wall.

The heat was becoming intense, the smoke thick and choking. My bandaged face was wet with blood, my empty eye sockets throbbing despite the anesthetic. But I kept moving, counting each pace, each turn.

I pushed through the door into the cool night air, stumbling forward until I collapsed on the grass. The heat of the inferno warmed my back as I crawled further away, guided only by the sensation of the flames against my skin.

The final explosion was the largest, sending burning debris raining down around me. I covered my head, waiting for the worst to pass, then continued crawling until I reached the old oak tree I knew stood thirty yards from the barn.

There, I finally allowed myself to stop, to feel the rough bark against my back as I listened to the destruction of Jessica's life work, the collection, the ritual, all of it consumed in cleansing fire.

I heard screams from inside the barn, then silence. No one else made it out.

When the paramedics found me, I was barely conscious. "Eyes," I kept muttering. "Eighty eyes. Plus mine. Eighty two."

They assumed I was delirious from pain and blood loss. In the ambulance, as they worked to stabilize me, one of them asked what happened.

"Fire," I said simply. "An accident."

It wasn't exactly a lie. For Jessica and her followers, my betrayal had indeed been an accident they never saw coming.

The police found six charred bodies in the barn's ruins. 

They found nothing that would prove my story, and I've offered no explanation beyond a tragic accident while exploring my family's old property.

I'm blind now, permanently. The doctors have offered prosthetics, but I've refused. The empty sockets, now healed into smooth hollows beneath my bandages, are my reminder of what I sacrificed to stop Jessica's ritual.

The newspapers called it a tragedy. 

A gathering of doctors and researchers, they said, killed in a freak accident. They never found the eyes. The heat of the fire had destroyed them completely, melting the containers and incinerating their contents. The Watchers would never see through those windows now.

It's been six months since that night. I live alone now, learning to navigate the world without sight. The nightmares are less frequent, though I still sometimes wake in a cold sweat, feeling Jessica's scalpel against my eye.

I may have lost my sight.

But in this darkness, I see more clearly than ever before.
