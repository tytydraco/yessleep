To the average passerby, it wouldn’t seem to be secretive, but it is. South of the town square, there is a huge field that goes out to an overlook of the water. There’s an abundance of flowers that riddle the field. Flowers of different kinds and colors, looking like it was ripped from Munchkinland in The Wizard of Oz. Not only is it beautiful to look at, but it’s a spectacle to listen to.



See, our town is blessed with a field of flowers that can sing. The songs they play can depend on the weather or the events of the town. If it’s a beautiful, cloudless day, the song is usually light and upbeat. If it’s raining, it’s still beautiful but melancholic. Around Christmas time, the flowers play a wealth of jingle bells. Saint Patrick's Day is a cacophony of light bagpipes. At night, a delicate lullaby for the whole town. This may sound like it could get annoying and droning, but the music being played is so peaceful and relaxing, that everyone accepts it as a part of life. Even newcomers to the town realize how soothing the songs are. It’s amazing. We only have one rule though, and we were working on signs that will be dotted around the field so no one forgets.



DO ***NOT*** PICK THE FLOWERS



In big red letters on a black background sign. Underneath that in white letters is our town's Preservation Society. I myself am a newer member of the society. Our only goal is to tend to the field during the winter. Making sure that everything looks okay and the flowers hold up. Otherwise, we leave the field alone and let the orchestral flora continue. Everyone in town knows this rule. 



Last summer, there was a family who moved in. A freshly built abode a few houses away from my own. I live on the southern side of the town, so I live close to the field. I was so happy a new family would experience the beauty the town gives us. I decided to head over and greet them after a day or so, just so they can be settled with no one bothering them. I knocked on the door and waited. To no avail. I tried knocking once more. Again, nothing. I looked over to the side of the door and found a strange looking doorbell. It had a big button on it and surrounding the button was a light. I pressed the large button and looked through the surrounding windows of the door frame. Lights blinked gently in the house, and around the corner came a bigger gentleman and a black haired woman. They flashed me huge smiles while walking down the hall to the door. They opened it to greet me. 



“Hello! Welcome to the neighborhood!” I said and handed them a welcome card. I got a gift certificate to our town's grocery store for them. They accepted it, smiled and bowed their heads, but didn’t say anything. I was taken aback a little bit but then I saw a small boy turn the corner nearest the door to see who was at his new house.



I gave him a big smile and said to all three of them. “I’m Maryann. If you need anything, I live in that home right there.” I turned and pointed towards my house. 



When I turned back. I saw the two adults staring at me. The woman started to move her hands up and began to sign. 

“Oh I’m so sorry I didn’t mean–” and then I noticed that the man and the young boy began to sign to each other as well. The whole family was deaf. 



I don’t know much, if any sign language, but for an assignment in school I had to learn my name. I signed it to them and they had big smiles across their faces. The man looked to have a moment of realization and reached for something out of the frame of the door. He handed me a pen and a yellow notepad. I took it and wrote a small message. 

  


*My name is Maryann. I apologize, the only ASL I know is my name. I guess I’ll start learning!  If you need* *anything* *please let me know. I live three houses away. I’m happy you guys are here!* 

  


They seemed really happy about that. They waved me goodbye and I walked back to my house. When I went back inside and sat on the couch, it hit me. They don’t even get to experience the joys of this town. They can’t experience the songs. 

  


I saw them around town every now and then and waved hello. I learned a few things at this point. A casual “How are you holding up?” and “Good to see you” but I still couldn’t figure a ton out. I was learning though. For them.  



One day I noticed that they left their house with things for the beach. It was beautiful outside and the music was lovely. I had some chores I let pile up in my house, so I would’ve also gone to the beach if it wasn’t for that. The family went towards the south of town, there was a path that led to the beach from there. 



The music was incredible. A slow mass of flutes, steel drums, bongos, and xylophones. All in a conglomerate of wonder. I was washing dishes and getting lost in the song. My hips swayed to the music as I had a big goofy smile on my face. 



Then the music stopped.



I stared at my hands as the water overflowed the bowl I had let slip into the sink. Silence enveloped me and I could hear my blood run through my body. Each heartbeat of mine got louder and louder. 



Then there was a roar. 



A roar that could take down a whole skyscraper. An ancient bellow. A growl of immense pain. A roar that shook the town. A roar I will never forget. I flinched at the noise but never broke my gaze with the half clean china. A tear rolled down my face. 



The music came back. Not as pleasant as it was before at first, but returned to its peaceful nature. 



A few days later the freshly built house was put up for sale. Neighbors claimed it was vacated. Haven't seen the family since their journey to the beach. The Preservation Society signs were put up all around the field and we’re working on more. Everyone in town knows the rule. The rule shall never be broken.
