The cicadas had finally arrived.



After weeks of breathless news reports anticipating the historic double emergence of two broods – 13 year Brood XIX and 17 year Brood XIII – the first creepy crawlies were finally emerging from their dark hibernation. The residents of our little town were excited to greet them, sharing photos on social media of cicadas as they came up out of their holes and marched across yards and sidewalks. Small children could be seen stooped over with sticks, poking these land crustaceans as they made their slow, clumsy journey towards the trees. Empty brown shells began to dot wooden fences and patio furniture, and the soft sssssssk-ssssssssk-sssssssk of their calls could be heard in the evening air.



The local news channel sent their C-string lifestyle reporter to our town to document the “invasion” – even though she had to drive around for an hour to find a tree with enough cicadas on it to justify the twenty seconds of airtime. The brewery down the street from our house added Cicada Shots to their menu, bottles of strong booze with dead bugs swirling around the bottom. People loved it.



But after the first few days, the novelty wore off. “It’s not so bad,” people shrugged to each other when they chatted while waiting for their restaurant to-go orders or in line at the grocery store. We had no way of knowing that this was just the beginning.



After the slow start of the first two weeks, the cicadas began to emerge in earnest. My husband John and 13 year old son Aidan moved them carefully out of the driveway before backing the car out of the garage, gently lifting them and carrying them to the grass, but there were soon too many. John got out the leaf blower and cleared a path every morning but by evening they peppered the pavement again in greater and greater numbers.



As I rode my bike to the library one afternoon, I noticed thickening splotches of smooshed cicadas in the streets and on the sidewalks. I gave up trying to avoid them, turning up my air pods to drown out the soft crunch of shells under my tires. It will be over soon, I reassured myself. Just a few more weeks to go.



The next morning, we stumbled out of bed bright and early and started the coffee maker. It was the last day of school, the last day of waking up early and packing lunches and navigating the school drop off line for three blessed months. We were so relieved we didn’t notice the noise in the air at first. What had been a steady background hum for the past few weeks was now an urgent screech. It sounded a bit like standing next to someone revving a chainsaw.



I handed Aidan his lunch and wished him luck on his last day. He rolled his eyes like only a teenager can, and opened the back door. Then he screamed.



“What?” I quickly ran over to find out what had him so terrified. Our entire back patio was a teeming, seething mass of insects. The table, chairs and umbrella weren’t even visible under the blanket of black bugs and brown shells. Every inch of the swing set was covered. With the door open the noise was deafening. We retreated to the kitchen and tried to come up with a plan.



Just then our phones pinged with simultaneous text messages. “It’s the school,” I said to John. I clicked open the message and scanned the lines quickly.



“Dear Cougar families. Due to the increased cicada activity overnight, we have made the decision to cancel the last day of school. We did not come to this decision lightly but our students’ and staff’s safety is of the utmost importance. Anything left in your child’s locker will be mailed to your home at a later date. Please stay safe.”



“Woo hoo!” yelled Aidan, throwing his arms in the air and doing a little dance in the kitchen. “Cicada day!” He disappeared into the basement family room without another word.



My husband looked confused. “What do you think they mean by ‘stay safe.’ That seems a little over-dramatic for a few bugs.”



I looked at him doubtfully. “That’s more than a few bugs, honey. I think they’re right, why go out if we don’t need to.” We both work from home so staying inside was no problem. We usually walk our dogs around the neighborhood once or twice day, but that was obviously not happening today. We would all just stay in until the ruckus died down.



The cicada calls were louder than they had been, but we adjusted our Teams settings to mask background noise and it seemed to do the trick, for the most part. During every meeting, people asked about the bugs. From what I was able to gather, the city had almost no cicadas at all. The suburbs seemed to be experiencing the highest number, with our small village at the epicenter of the emergence. I uploaded a photo of our backyard into the meeting chat and a co-worker said I should send it to the news station. I laughed and said I thought the cicadas had probably used up their 15 minutes of fame.



At dinner time, we made a survey of our food situation. We had a lot of extra cans on hand, a habit I had gotten into during the pandemic. The freezer was full of frozen foods and there was a shelf in the pantry of canned garden veggies from last fall. We decided that we could stay home comfortably for several days, even a week if it came to that.



I was pouring a tin of tomatoes into a pot to make chili when the alarms went off. The high pitched beep of the emergency alert system barely made it above the shrill scream of the cicadas, even with the windows closed and the air conditioner running. I wiped my hands on a towel and went into the living room where John was standing in front of the television.



A scared-looking news anchor was reading from a printed paper in her hands. “...Level of mutation is unprecedented,” she was saying urgently. “Scientists at the Botanical Garden believe that extended chemical exposure has led this particular brood of cicadas to become omnivores. That is to say, their usual diet of tree sap has been expanded to include biological fluids. We have had multiple reports today of cicadas consuming small animals, pets, and at least one suspected human fatality in the western suburbs. Schools were cancelled today and police are urging citizens to shelter in place, with all doors and windows locked. If you must leave your home, it is imperative to cover your arms and legs with long sleeves. Tuck your pants into boots and your sleeves into gloves and secure them with a strong tape. Also wear a head covering with netting tucked into your collar.” A graphic on the screen showed common household items that could be used as armor and cicada smashing weapons.



“Is this a joke?” I said to my husband. “They’re just bugs! They don’t eat people.”



He was scrolling on his phone and didn’t respond right away. Finally he looked up, pale and shaken. “I don’t think it’s a joke,” he said. He held up the screen so I could see an Instagram post of an animal skeleton being picked clean by cicadas. A bright blue collar was still around the neck.



“I think this was a dog,” he said quietly, and looked like he wanted to throw up.



I went to the windows and looked outside. No one was on the sidewalk and there were only a few cars in the streets. The entire front lawn, sidewalk and all of our landscaping were covered with a moving carpet of cicadas. Cars rolling down the street had cicadas stuck all over them and left trails of crushed bugs in their wake.



As we stood there gazing out, a soft thud hit the window. Then another. And another and another, as cicadas started launching themselves towards the plate glass. We stepped back quickly. “Can they see us?” I wondered uneasily.



“Maybe,” he said. “Or maybe they sense heat. I’m not sure. Let’s close the curtains though.”



We went around the house, closing blinds and curtains. Soon it was dark as night inside, even though the sun wouldn’t set for another two hours.



I looked at our dogs. “What do we do about them?” I asked John. “They’ll have to go potty eventually.”



“Not outside,” he said grimly. “You saw that photo. We’ll just have to clean up after them for a few days.” We rolled up all the rugs and stuffed them behind the sofa. It was annoying and inconvenient but I wasn’t truly scared. Not yet. That would come later.



That night, we watched the news for hours, turning the volume way up to be heard over the cries of the mating cicadas until we gave up and switched to closed captions. By the time we went to bed, there were 3 confirmed human fatalities and hundreds of injuries. They suspected that 13-17 years of exposure to chemical pesticides and fertilizers had created this mutant strain. It was unknown if the cicadas’ lifespan was affected or just their diet. But they had an undeniable hunger for blood, and it was suggested that they were laying eggs inside the bodies of the people and animals they didn’t devour. I wondered what would be worse, being eaten alive by insects or becoming a living host for their larvae. I shivered at the thought.



Outside, not a soul was moving on the street when we peeked through the blinds. The only sound was the crushing scream of millions of cicadas surrounding our house. I picked up my cell phone and found that there was no signal. Without a landline in our house, we were completely cut off from the rest of the world. We were on our own.



\* \* \* \* \*



I was dreaming, a nightmare of being chased by hungry insects who could find me no matter where I hid. In my dream I couldn’t tell if the cicadas were screaming or if I was – until I felt them swarming over my skin and into my open mouth. Just as I started to choke, I found myself jolted awake, sitting up in bed, heart beating wildly, sweat drenching my pajamas. I quickly ran my hands over my body, my mouth, ensuring everything was ok. It was just a dream. Then I heard the dogs barking hysterically in the living room.



John was already out of bed by the time my feet hit the floor. I ran into the room 3 steps behind him. “What is it?!” I yelled, fumbling for the switch on the table lamp.



The sudden light illuminated a terrifying scene. Somehow cicadas had gotten into the house. They were crawling up the walls, on the bricks of the fireplace, on the cream-colored linen curtains. Both dogs had cicadas on their fur, and they were barking in terror and snapping at them wildly. I dropped to my knees and started ripping off bugs and flinging them away, smashing them with my hands.



“How are they getting in?” screamed Aidan behind me.



I whipped around frantically. “Go to  your room!” I shouted over the sound of cicadas and dog whimpers. “Close the door and put a towel under it. Stay in there until I tell you to come out!” He turned and bolted, for once doing what he was told without argument.



“The fireplace!” yelled John. He dropped to his knees in front of a seething pile of cicadas in the gas fireplace and reached his hand up inside. I could hear him cranking the flue closed; I was flabbergasted. How had we forgotten about the flue? It was a direct line into our house from the outside. We slammed the glass fireplace door shut and secured them with the belt from my robe.



The next hour was a blur of bug smashing. I grabbed a pair flip flops from the entry way and wiped out every bug on the walls and ceiling, while John stomped bugs into the hardwood floors with his bare feet. When we were done we were covered with insect guts and broken wings, panting and sweating.



Suddenly I became aware of a noise I could hear through the whirling screech of cicadas. It was faint, a high-pitched sound coming from next door. The sound of screaming. We ran to the dining room window and peeled back the curtain.



The neighbor’s house was dark, but that’s definitely where the screams were coming from. “The flue,” whispered John. They didn’t close theirs either, and they had no dogs to bark and alert them when the bugs came in. They were probably still in their beds when the insects started to feast, unable to fight them off or escape. One of their blinds twitched and for a second we saw, by the light of the full moon, a hand come up and hit the window. It quickly disappeared, leaving behind a rusty smear of blood.



John started for the door but I grabbed his arm. “We can’t help them!” I said, shaking my head. “Even if you could get over there, the house is full of cicadas. There’s nothing we can do for them now.”



“But..” He was shaking, and I know he still wanted to go next door, to try and get their teenagers out of the house at least. But he also knew that I was right, that there was no way to save them, and he would only be throwing his life away.



“We need you here,” I whispered. I brushed a crushed cicada off his shoulder and squeezed his hand, looking into his eyes. “Aidan needs you."



He nodded and took the dogs into the bathroom to wash out their wounds while I wiped bug guts off the walls and floor.



Thankfully, the dogs were ok. We used warm water to flush out hundreds of tiny cicada eggs from their injuries, pink blobby swirls that oozed towards the drain. There was no way of knowing if we got them all, but we did our best. By the time we were wiping away the last smears of bug guts and eggs, the sun was coming up.



Aiden cracked his door open and I told him it was safe to come out. He looked like he had gotten no sleep at all, and his eyes were red and puffy from crying. “Are the dogs ok?” he asked, looking at them huddling together, damp and miserable, on the couch.



“I think so,” I nodded. “Are you ok?”



A tear slipped down his cheek as he shook his head. “The neighbors…” he whispered, and I hugged him to me tightly.



“I know,” I said into his hair as I rubbed his back. “It’s so sad about the Carsons.”



He pulled away and looked up at me. “No, I mean the other neighbors.” He grabbed my hand and pulled me to his bedroom window. I peeked through the blinds and in the soft glow of dawn I could see directly into the neighbor’s house on the other side of us. It was a bedroom, a nursery, with teddy bear curtains on the window. They were open and I could see inside. The corner of a crib railing, a comfortable chair, a changing table. And every inch of it was crawling with cicadas.



I quickly let the blinds close and stepped back from the window, a hand over my mouth. Maybe they were gone, I told myself. Maybe they got out before it got bad. I looked at my son and knew I had to keep it together, for him. I forced a smile and reached out to stroke his hair again. “We’re safe in here,” I told him. “Everything is locked up tight. They can’t get in again.” I hoped it was true.



That morning, we worked to seal off all the vents, the attic trap door and basement windows using plastic and duct tape. We dug out the hand crank radio from our emergency kit, but the news had stopped reporting fatality numbers, instead repeating instructions to secure your home and stay put. The National Guard was going door to door and collecting survivors from the hardest hit areas. They had a refugee camp somewhere up north where it was colder, and safer. A video showed soldiers with flame throwers clearing a path to a suburban brick ranch, bringing out a family under a small white tent and helping them into a Humvee.



Outside, in the distance, above the roar of cicadas, I could just make out the deep rumble of diesel engines and the reassuring chop of helicopters.



We packed our bags and waited for the knock on our door, knowing that we just had to hang on for a few more hours and then this all would be behind us. It would become a story we’d tell our families at the holidays, our friends over backyard beers and burgers. How we survived the carnivorous cicada double brood of 2024. Soon we would be safe, with nothing to worry about. Back to life as usual.



At least, for another 13 years.
