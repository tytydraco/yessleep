I was obsessing over $k1nw@lkers for months, I've read so many stories about them, talked about them with friends, fell asleep to videos of them, if your reading this this is your sign to stop obsessing over them. When you hear people say to not say they're name because it attracts them to you this is true. I didn't believe it either but I believed in them so I would continue saying they're names 

I'm a normal 16 year old girl that lives in the woods of Vermont, I've lived in Vermont my whole life but moved to this house a few months ago  I've always loved like crytidcore and creepy woods and stuff but when we moved here I had a really bad feeling about the woods, looking at them bothered me and I always got a gut feeling that there was something bad out there... 

 My friend came over a few days ago and we were messing around with scary stuff at this haunted battlefeild up the hill from my house and by the time we got back to my house it was dark, we were sitting in my room and there's a window in my room that faces straight towards the woods, these woods are thick and dark.

 I had a fan in my window so it was open and me and my friend were chilling and then we hear in a deep male voice come from the woods "HELP". Me and her froze in fear and looked at each other. It was at that moment I realized I shouldn't have said they're name, I should have never obsessed, I looked at her and said "look at your messages look at what I texted you" 

and I said "that's the noise $k1nw@lk3rs make" and we just kept looking at each other, the silence went on for about 5 seconds then we hear another "HELP ME" and the woods went quiet... Dead silent, no crickets,nothing me and her were completely frozen in fear and at this point we were just curled up silently, then we heard the sound of metal scraping on metal, I don't know how else to discribe it other than Freddy Krugers knives scraping metal, but it was distant, it got closer and closer to my window and it kept getting close for about 10 seconds.

 it was when me and her realized it wasn't metal scraping... It was groaning, a low whiney groan, I dont know how to explain it other than like a really pathetic chainsaw but it kept getting close and closer to the point it was right next to my window.

 my friend managed to squeeze out the word run and we bolted for my door and ran to my mom crying and told her what happened, we were fucking terrified but she didnt believe us, i made her shut my window and my friend  left.nothing else happened that night but that was a few days ago, 

today.. it was around 9pm but it was really dark outside and there was a casserole dish with old Mac and cheese in the fridge that I was told to go dump, I told my mom before I went out that I was scared and there was something out there.but i went outside and threw it in the woods and as soon ss i stepped out the woods went silent again, I was fucking petrified, woods dont just go silent like that, but then i heard rustling coming from close by and i got the fuck out of there.

I don't know what I'm expecting to get from posting this here. Nobody believes me but I have never used reddit in my life and I downloaded it just to post this. Maybe it's answers I'm looking for, another plausible explanation?
Has anyone else experienced anything like this before, please help.
