It was late at night , My friend Jake had sent me a video named Control.mp4. It was normal for him to send me weird videos he found on the dark web, So I couldn't be bothered to check it when I had my final exam the next day and went to sleep.


I went to school and gave my exam the next day . After the exam , The school had a session on mental health awareness. They told us how help is available for everyone and what happened to Jake was unfortunate.


I was shocked , The school just told me that Jake took his own life. There's no way that's possible. Jake had some weird hobbies but he was a happy guy , There's no way he'd take his own life. Something was up and I knew it.


I quickly went home and tried to call Jake , There was no answer. I tried texting him, But there was no reply. I looked up his name on the internet and there it was , An article about how Jake had taken his own life.


The article said that multiple cuts were made by a knife on him before the final cut to the throat. There were no images. I started writing everything that I have found on this page whoever is reading , It might help me figure out what's going on. 


I suddenly remembered the video he had sent me the night before , "Maybe that has something to do with this?" I thought and quickly opened the vid Control.mp4


It was a 30 minute long video. In the first minute , There was a teenage girl sitting on a sofa. Soon she took a knife and started making cuts on her face while screaming for help.


"Why is she screaming for help when she herself is making the cuts?" was my first thought. At the end of the first minute , She cut her throat and the cries for help stopped.


In the 2nd minute , It was a guy in his twenties. The exact same thing happened with him. He started cutting himself while screaming for help and then cut his own throat.


It was the same with the 3rd , 4th ,5th and every single minute afterwards. I was feeling sick, All of these people were taking their lives while screaming for help. Why?


I finally reached the 29th minute, It was Jake. He started cutting himself in the same manner as everyone else , Crying for help. Nobody was there to help him , He finally stopped after cutting his throat.


I was crying at that point , Maybe if I had replied then I could've saved him. That's when I suddenly noticed that the video was sent by me to one of my other friends.


I was confused because I never sent that. That's when the 30th minute of the video started , The video shouldn't have been longer than 30 minutes. I started watching , Then I saw who was in the video.


**It was me holding a knife**


**HELP ME**
