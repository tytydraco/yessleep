In the South, Wakes used to be a very common occurrence. A simple ceremony to show respect for the dead. My father said it was a way to ensure that the dead don’t leave this earth knowing they’re alone, and it also gives everyone a chance to say goodbye. I was a little pipsqueak back in the day, and before I did the wake, the world seemed wonderful and free of any pain. Then my parents sat me down and said that my grandfather had passed away. It gutted me and I cried that night. The only problem was that I never knew him that well. I had vague feelings about him, like I remembered his presence, but I couldn’t form a concrete memory. Evidently, he cared for me much when I was a baby and babysat whenever he could. And even then, he was an older man. I mean *old*. He didn’t have my Dad and Uncle with my grandmother until he was in his late forties. He passed at the age of 98, and by all accounts, he died in the best way possible: relaxed in his bed, with a faint smile on his face. He might’ve even had a good dream as he passed. Or maybe that's just how I chose to see it. In the end, his last wish was that no one would leave him alone until he was buried in the ground.

We lived in Laurel County and had to drive on down to Bell County to do the wake. They explained it to me on the way down, and I thought it was scary, but I was too afraid to protest. My parents were clearly saddened by my grandfather’s death, even if it *was* peaceful. I asked some other family members about it years later, and many had similar feelings: He just seemed like the type of person you never expected to die, like he’d be around forever and ever. When someone like that goes away from your life, it stings. We arrived at my grandfather’s house around five or six in the afternoon, I’m not sure when exactly. It was a two-story Victorian home with a wrap-around porch and an unkempt yard that was slowly turning into a mudhole due to the rain. All I knew was there were a lot of vehicles out front, but it was mostly trucks of varying colors and varying amounts of rust coating the bodies. There were folks on the porch, some sitting in chairs and some standing, looking out into the yard. Sadly, there weren’t any kids my age there. My cousins, whom I consider to be some of my best friends, wouldn’t be born until two to three years later. My Uncle Gary wasn’t married yet, and his wife Lydia wouldn’t be in the picture until a year later. As I looked at the crowd, I never felt so alone. I was the lone child in a sea of aged family. Some folks were red-faced by tears, and many were silent. Just soaking in the sad truth that Walter Ernest Blakely was no more. My Uncle Gary made contact with me and gave a thin smile,

“Hey, Kiddo.”

“Hello, Uncle Gary.”

“You okay?”

“Yeah.”

“Parents, feeding ya good?”

“Yeah.”

“Good.”

He approached my dad with a fierce hug, and I even heard him sob into his shoulder. They exchanged words, I’m not sure what was spoken, but I’m positive it was something that was to stay between them. While they chatted, my mother grabbed my hand and led me inside the house. An array of great aunts, cousins, uncles, & family friends all approached me saying similar things, ‘My God, you’ve gotten big!’,  ‘How old are you now?’, ‘You playing any sports yet?’, etc. After getting acquainted with the rest of the family. My Father and Uncle Gary returned to the house. My Mother told me to get acquainted and look around the house for anything that interests me.

“Your Papaw wanted us to take some things when he passed. He didn’t really care about what went to who, but he made sure that you got to look around first. Just pick some things out that you like.”

“Okay. How long is a wake?” I said sheepishly.

My Mother’s face turned solemn because she knew what my reaction might’ve been. Telling any child that ‘we’re spending the night with your deceased grandparent’ might elicit an angry or distressed reaction. However, when she told me, I was oddly fine with it. Despite not being at my grandfather’s in a long time, I felt relaxed here. I was here as a baby, but maybe, somewhere in my mind, I remembered this place somehow. Like a phantom sense of nostalgia washed over me. I went through the house, looking at everything that might interest me. I noticed the mirrors in the house were covered.

My first instinct, as a silly little kid, was that my grandfather was a vampire. But later, my relatives cleared up the significance to me as nothing more than superstition and tradition. I came across his bedroom, and it was more sparse than I imagined for someone like him. While I was in the house, I’d heard stories about him in passing, and it made him out to be a larger-than-life figure. Yet, the bedroom was plain and unassuming. There were no rugs, just a regular wooden floor that creaked with every step I took. As I looked around, I noticed he had a closet, a dresser, a mirror (which was covered), a bed with lavender colored sheets, and at the foot of his bed was a weathered wooden chest. Being a child raised in adventure tales told to me by my father, by radio shows, & as I grew older, by books…this looked like a treasure chest that I always imagined having. Looking at it piqued my curiosity. What could be in there? What on earth did my late grandfather keep to himself? I had a tinge of guilt about wanting to look inside, but who was I going to offend? A man who ain’t even here anymore?

Against my better judgment, I opened it, and the metallic hinges squeaked as I did. Looking inside, I saw no gold of any kind that I had been hoping for. There were, however, plenty of eclectic items to look at. There were medals he had from a conflict that I knew nothing about from my History classes, and he even had an army-issued revolver. I held it in my hand; it felt cool to have a *real* gun in my hand as opposed to one of the faux-metal cap guns that I had. I put it aside and kept digging around.

‘I’m keeping the gun,’ I thought, ‘it’s too cool to give to somebody else.’

I brushed away pictures of kids and a woman (who I think was my grandmother). There were old books, some I thought I might pocket for myself. Most had interesting titles, and all of them were written by a man named Faulkner. I set them aside, along with the gun, and kept digging around. At the bottom was something wrapped up in tissue and twine. I lifted the object up and felt its hefty weight. Under the twine, there was a note. I plucked it beneath the bound item and saw a scribble of writing on it:

*‘TO JACK’*

That was my name. I unfolded the paper and looked at the writing.

*‘Jack,*

*You may not know me well, but you will. Bring this downstairs when they have my wake and turn it upside down. You must be alone.*

*Love,*

*-Papaw’*

My blood felt icy reading the note. I removed the cloth and twine to find an hourglass. It was glass; the top and bottom were made with what looked like copper, and the sand was an almost dark red, bordering on black. ‘Turn it over,’ the letter said. ‘You may not know me well, but you will’. I was scared, but my curiosity outweighed fear. I had to understand why my grandfather wanted me to find this hourglass. I covered it back up with the cloth and put it inside my jacket. When I exited the room, I was met by my Uncle Gary, who had tired eyes and in his right hand was a cup of bourbon.

“Hey, Kiddo. Find anything you might like?”

“Yeah. He has neat stuff.”

“Well, your grandfather *was* neat. After we have the wake and the graveside, maybe we’ll go to lunch and we’ll tell you stories.”

He looked at me, concealing something under my jacket,

“Whatcha got?”

I couldn’t shield it from him or they’d surely suspect something. So I lifted the hourglass into the light, and it wowed him.

“What a pretty hourglass!”

“Yeah, there’s some over stuff in there I want too, but I’ll let my mama know what I picked out.”

“I see. Want to know what I might get?”

“What?”

There was a glimmer of light in. His eyes as he talked. He wasn’t crying, but his eyes were wet. Perhaps he mourned all he needed and cried all he wanted. He blinked back tears, but there was no sadness in his voice; more than anything, he seemed oddly calm.

“The arrowheads. You see, Dad- Sorry, Papaw, he loved collecting things from the past. He loved seeing things that used to be, and one of his favorite things to collect were arrowheads. This used to be Cherokee land, and he loved how he knew he was on historic land. Stolen land, sure, but historic nonetheless. He thought it was incredible to think about tribes weaving in and out of the woods, children running free with each other, making fires at night, singing songs, making deerskin clothing, and, of course, folks hunting. All the records of this stuff might be in museums. Pots, deerskin stuff, tools…but you know what relic is available right beneath your feet?”

“Arrowheads?”

“That’s right! Arrowheads! They’re the only piece of history that you ain’t gotta buy or auction for. You find it anywhere, and then it’s yours. Your papaw had nearly fifty, and they are displayed in the smoking room above his fireplace. You’ll see them when you go in to see him.”

He patted me on the shoulder and told me to hold on to the hourglass. He gave me a hug and walked around in silence, sipping his cup of bourbon. I descended the stairs to hear the family still chatting amongst themselves, and catching up. I didn’t see my Mother or Father, so I asked my great-aunt Helen where they were. She brushed my hair back and said they were with my Grandfather. She pointed the way, and I found myself in the smoke room. It was an apt name; the whole damn room reeked of cigarette smells, and the furniture had this yellowish tinge. Like the whole room was stained by nicotine. Within the room was my father being consoled by my mother. He was sobbing as she rubbed his back. In front of them was a plain casket with a thin linen sheet draped over the outline of a man’s shape. The fireplace was lit and crackled. Above the hearth was a display case of 50 arrowheads of different shapes and makes, just as my Uncle told me. My mother looked over her shoulder and noticed me. She leaned in to my Father to whisper to him, and he stood to his feet in an instant. He cleared his throat and wiped away the tears as he turned to face me.

“There you are!” He said in a half-assed attempt to appear happier or unfazed by the display of death in front of him, “I see you found something, huh?”

“Yeah. There’s other stuff I picked out too.”

“Good. Don’t mind me, son, I’m just…sad.”

It’s the first time I’d seen my father so distraught; he wasn’t terribly old, but grief aged him in ways I didn’t think possible, like where my father was, a husk only remained. The hourglass felt heavier the longer I held it. I remembered the words of the letter, and I asked nervously,

“Can I have a moment with Papaw?”

My parents looked slightly surprised and maybe even a little confused at first. But when they looked at me, I guess they felt pity for a little boy who hardly knew his grandfather. My mother approached me and softly spoke,

“Take as long as you need, sweetheart.”

She kissed me on the forehead and walked out back into the hall. My father straightened himself up and patted my shoulder.

"Lemme know when you're done, me and Gary will stay with him the rest of the night. You can rest in his bedroom if you like."

I nodded, and off he went.

When the door closed behind me, I saw a bolt lock, and I instinctively locked it. It was just me and my grandfather now. The flame of the fireplace danced, leaving vibrating shadows streaking across the floor and ceiling. I saw the silhouette of my grandfather’s corpse outlined by the fire, and I thought about the note. Why am I doing this? Why am I here? Maybe it was an obligation to the dead, to a man I was so desperate to know that I was willing to do anything for him. I sat in a weathered old chair with the hourglass facing the casket. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and flipped the hourglass. The sands trickled down, making a fine noise as they fell down the glass.

“Please,” I spoke to the void, “Please.”

Nothing. For the longest time, there was nothing. Disappointed was an understatement. The note scared me, but it intrigued me too. The idea of talking with my grandfather, whom I barely knew, seemed like a miraculous occasion. I should’ve known better than to trust the words of a dying old man, maybe even a delusional one. But I wanted to believe. As I was about to get out of the leather chair, the coffin made a loud, audible *thump*. I stopped in place, frozen, and pondering if what I’d heard was real. My sense of sound was heightened, trying to pick up on the slightest noise. The crackling fire, the sand running through the glass, and a rhythmic thumping noise that grew and grew until I realized it was my own heart.

That’s when I heard the snaps and pops of old bones being put into motion like rusty, ancient cogs in an old machine. Rising from the casket, adorned in a fine suit, was a waxy and pale imitation of a living man. He looked like the picture on the table, but worse, good God, so much worse. He had both eyes closed, but I could see them moving beneath the uncanny flesh, and behind a sewn mouth, I could hear him moaning- no, trying to speak! Dear Christ! He needed to talk! His fingers clasped at his mouth, trying desperately to tear his lips apart to no avail! Trying to open eyes shut by glue! That’s when I remembered the arrowheads! As the figure in the casket struggled to regain his senses, I laid the hourglass down and rushed behind the coffin to grab the arrowhead display case off the wall. I yanked it off the screw and propped it open, grabbing the sharpest arrowhead I could see. I went to the corpse thrashing in the casket and tried to place my hand on him to ease him, but he whimpered at the touch.

“Papaw!” I said, and then it stopped and looked in my direction. The undead, waxy-faced old man looked at me with a face of what looked to be shock. I continued,

“Papaw, I got an arrowhead, you can…you can cut-“

I didn’t even get a chance to finish my sentence when he showed me an open palm. Like he was waiting to receive the arrowhead, I placed it in his palm, and he immediately went to work on his eyes, cutting into the crevices of the eyelids. After the arrowhead tore through skin, the eye caps fell into his lap, and two panicked, grey, & withered eyes shot around the room and finally landed on me. Tears filled its eyes as it saw me. He dug the arrowhead into his lips, ripping the stitches in his sewn mouth. The noise was unpleasant, like leather getting ripped apart. When the last stitch was torn, he gasped for breath like a diver bobbing for air after swimming a marathon.

“…J…Ja…” He coughed, dust & phlegm shot from the decayed mouth. The smell was that of formaldehyde & cheap perfume. He sat upright in his coffin, rubbing his throat.

“Jack.”

I was too scared to talk.

“It’s okay, Jack, I know you’re scared, but you don’t have to be!”

He smiled, revealing an array of crooked and yellowed teeth. He was a nightmare to look at, but he had this infectious energy about him. The phantom nostalgic feeling hit me again. I truly knew this man; this was my papaw. He may be waxy, he may be pale, and he may smell…but that’s my papaw. I approached him slowly, and he yanked me in for a hug. He was so strong, I could hear the joints in his body popping with every movement.

“Goddamn, Jack, I missed you so much!”

He released me and marveled at me.

“You’re so big! My God! How old are you now?”

“I’m ten.”

He chuckled, but it made him cough once more. His eyes darted around the smoke room, and he finally spotted it: the Hourglass.

“You read the note! Thank God! You done good, Jack!”

I was still in shock, and all I got out was,

“How? How are you doing this?”

His hopeful smile dropped, and he adopted a more serious expression. He almost looked sad. If only I knew why, I wouldn’t have asked.

He pointed over to the hourglass and spoke,

“*That* is why I'm doing what I’m doing. And it was all for you.”

“All for me?”

“Yes. Sit back down, Jack. I’ll explain.”

I did what I was asked, and when I sat down in the leather chair, I noticed that the sand in the hourglass was starting to accumulate at the bottom.

“The day you were born, I was so glad. I felt like heaven had leapt into my heart. And I was looking forward to spending so much time with you. God, you were such a beautiful baby. I had hoped that I would have more time on this earth, but in my final years, my body started to fail. When you get as old as I am, you’ll learn. Nobody ever thinks they’re getting old until it sneaks up and bites you in the ass.”

I giggled at that, and I think my Grandfather liked hearing me laugh. He continued.

“Anyway, the visits became less frequent, and then I stopped seeing you after you were five. I didn’t want you to see me like that; I didn’t want your memory of me to be a frail, dying man. But I always wrote, and your father always wrote back. He always traced your hand in the letters. I always got a kick out of seeing your hand get bigger and bigger. One night, I felt my heart pounding away, like my heart was gonna burst out of my chest...then it dawned on me that I'd never see you grow up. I'd never see you as a young man, and you'd never remember a word I said to you. But I had to find a way to carry on, to be here for you, to talk with you, be with you, have a chance to tell you how much I loved you..."

He stopped to inhale, he'd whipped himself in a frenzy, and coughed again. He cleared his throat and looked to me with solemn eyes.

"So, I made a bargain with something you should never know about. He will remain nameless here, but I performed a ritual. I tied myself to that hourglass so that you could turn back the clock on death itself! Maybe you think me a fool, but you'll never know the love for your children and your children's children until you've held them in your hands."

I was silent, I looked at the hourglass, and now the bottom was starting to fill up. Ten minutes had passed since he first turned the hourglass. We stared at each other, wondering who would speak first, but I asked,

"What did you bargain with?"

"That's not important now, Jack. Sometimes we do wild things for those we love. All I know is that I'm here now. It may not be long, but it'll be enough."

He paused, smiling at me, the ripples in his skin grotesquely wrinkling as he did. The teeth were crooked and yellow, and he folded his hands upon his lap. He asked,

"How's school?"

And from there, we talked about anything and everything. I talked about my problems at school, my friends, the girls I liked, my interests, my favorite books, etc. And he replied in kind with thorough, painstaking detail about similar experiences he's had. He talked about so much that I cannot squeeze it all into one story. Each time he talked, there was joy, humor, wisdom, and above all else, kindness in his words. It's like I was reintroduced to him for the first time; my vague feelings and emotions about the man had finally transformed into a tangible figure, which I could comfortably call my papaw. If only he could've stayed, and if only he hadn't performed that goddamned ritual. If only... what a terrifying two-word phrase, ain't it?

Time passes quickly when you're with those you love, whether it be friends or family. Conversation has a magical quality that makes time fly over the most mundane things, such as that night in my grandfather's smoke room. The hourglass ran far too quickly for either of us; we could've kept talking for hours, days, even. But once the sands trickled to their grains, my grandfather's expression changed, and a sudden fear overtook him. I could hear it in his trembling voice and saw it in his jittery mannerisms. He watched the sands run out as he desperately spoke to me,

"Jack, I love you; you'll never know how much your papaw loves you. Don't forget our talk. I'm sorry we had to meet like this. Maybe we could've talked in heaven, but that was too long a wait."

As he spoke, I heard creaking wood under the carpet of the smoke room. I turned around to find nothing. I returned my gaze to my grandfather to see that he was frozen in horror, eyes bulging from their sockets.

"Jesus Christ, help me. Forgive me."

The footsteps inched closer, and now it sounded like there were more of them. They surrounded me in the small room, and creaks in the wood shattered the silence. I looked at the carpet and saw the indentations of hoofprints making their way closer to the coffin. My grandfather's eyes were transfixed on these unseen things, and dark tears that stank of rot began to roll down his face. He looked at me and pleaded,

"Close your eyes, kiddo, you don't need to see this."

"Papaw, what did you do? What is this?!"

"I'm sorry, but maybe someday you'll understand. I'd happily burn in hell if it meant that you'd know just how much you're loved."

The things crept closer,

"Our father..."

Step.

"Who art in heaven..."

Step.

"Hallowed by thy name..."

Step.

"Thy kingdom come..."

Step.

"Thy will be done..."

Step.

"On Ear-"

They were upon him in seconds, his arms flew backwards as if he were being restrained, and he thrashed his head around until it was held suddenly still by another unseen force. He was struggling to speak, let alone breathe.

"God help me!" he screamed, "Jesus Christ help me, I repent! I'm sorry!"

I heard a knock at the door behind me,

"Jack?!" My father said, "What's going on in there?!"

The door shook; he was trying to get in, but I was too horrified to move. My blood froze as I saw these unseen things restrain the man I knew as my papaw. He was in a state of panic, trying to do everything he could to break free, his decrepit bones snapping from the force. He looked at me and screamed,

"CLOSE YOUR EYES! DON'T OPEN THEM!"

I cupped my hands over my eyes and shut my eyelids so hard I started seeing stars. In the darkness, I heard my grandfather utter his last words.

"I LOVE YOU, JACK, YOUR PAPAW LO-"

A tremendous clatter struck the carpeted floor of the smoke room. The door behind me was getting kicked in. As I opened my eyes, I saw the coffin was toppled over onto the floor, my grandfather splayed out on the floor in his suit. His limbs twisted in unnatural places like a discarded doll, and his face was wrought with terror. When the door swung open, my father found me wailing in the room, curled up into a ball.

I don't remember much after that. My father was distraught at the sight of his father; he screamed at me to explain what happened, but I knew deep down that he'd never believe me. What I ended up telling him was that I was crying and yelling that I wish he wasn't dead, and then the stand he was on broke. He didn't believe me at first, but I kept repeating it so often that I began to believe it myself. After the funeral, my family went out for lunch and swapped stories about my grandfather. Some of them I'd heard from my grandfather himself in his reanimated state. When it came time to pick out items from his house, my Uncle Gary got the arrowhead collection, but it appeared he was one arrowhead short; he chalked it up to misremembering. I got the old revolver, his Faulkner books, and of course the hourglass.

Time went by too damn fast. I bought my grandfather's house, regardless of the memories I had there; it was a beautiful home. I met a wonderful woman named Lydia, who I'd call my wife, had a kid, got older, and then saw those around me die off. Apart from the accident that claimed Lydia, they were almost all natural causes. When I became a grandfather, it was one of the best days of my life. You were so precious to me, and I was so excited to share my life with you. Then the headaches started, and shortly, I landed myself in the hospital. The Doc didn't hold back and gave it to me straight. When my grandfather wrote his letter to me, he was in his nineties, but I write this letter to you as a sixty-year-old man who'd just gotten a brain cancer diagnosis. I have five years left, give or take. Joseph, my wonderful grandson, now you know why I've gifted you the hourglass. I've bled the sands of time, gouging the palm of my hand with the arrowhead I'd kept from that day and made the same pact as my grandfather, because I know now. I know what it means to not be there, to just be a feeling for a child who won't remember you. Joseph, you will know me, God willing, you will know me.

When I die, follow these instructions at the wake: Go to the smoke room, make sure you're alone, turn the hourglass upside down, and then we can talk. Before the sands run out, I want you to close the coffin lid down and leave the room. No one should see what I saw. I don't know where I'll go; maybe it's hell. But I'd gladly burn, just like my grandfather.

*You'll never know how loved you are.*

*-Papaw Jack*
