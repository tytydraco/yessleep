We arrived at the hospital around 7:30 at night, me (Jax) and my partners Ryan (a big quiet man) and Sydney (probably the most beautiful women I’ve ever met) get out of the all black van with the only noticeable marking being a logo with 3 arrows pointing towards themselves.

The hospital itself had shut down around 30 years prior because of what was assumed to be an outbreak of some illness that was never identified killing over half the patients in a night, it was only 1 floor but still decently sized for the era it was made in, what used to most likely be a nice building was now moss covered and mostly boarded up, located in the north part of Florida.

“We’ve arrived on site” I say into my radio as we start strapping on our plate carriers with 3 extra magazines for our AR15s and clipping on our side holsters for our Glock 19s and lastly our helmets only rated to stop small calibers but strong enough to take blunt force if necessary and of course nvgs with it being abandoned and all.

“10-4 Jax were not to sure what class this is so precede with caution” 

“Great” Sydney says knowing the potential danger since we have almost no information other then that recently some “explorers” had went missing

“Yall know the drill, search and rescue if they’re alive but our main objective is exterminating the anomaly” I say to my team 
Ryan just nods his head never being much of a talker but most big guys aren’t and he was at-least 6ft5inches

Walking into the building I say something into my radio along the lines of we’re entering the building, flipping on the nvgs the tall dark hallway lights up green as we start to enter, there’s a front desk with a long hallway behind it that looked to separate into 6 other small halls for the patient rooms and a kitchen on the far left side.

Ignoring the kitchen we start heading down the long hallway planning to start from the back of the hospital and make our way up to the front as we step over broken glass and push empty beds out our way we head to the end of the hall planning to start on the side hall to the right since the other seemed to be mostly empty with only what looks like the remains of the rehab part of the hospital, heading down the hall we stop at room 1 and see nothing inside or out, pulling out my scanner to check the anomaly rating to see nothings going off which repeats for every room till we reach room 6 the last door on the right.

Before opening the door the device starts beeping like crazy, silencing it we all turn to each other and prepare to breach and enter the room, me taking point I slowly open the door stepping into a room that looks like it was never abandoned, we did a double take and yep a completely normal looking hospital room, stepping in we see nothing till we see a bathroom door which we prepare to breach as I hear something moving around in there.

“I’ll take point” I whisper nodding to Sydney and Ryan, kicking the door open I see what looks to be a 1980s era looking nurse cleaning the bathroom

“Umm hello” I say to the lady who hasn’t even turned around to acknowledge our presence

“Hello” I say louder reaching to grab their shoulder and spin them around, but when I do what turns around was almost normal except the face, the hair, nails, body, everything about her or it was normal atleast for the time period we assume it’s from but the face, it had wide black eyes with a single white dot that I assume was its pupal, a mouth that hung open like something from the Evil dead, and ears that leaked black goo, and a skull like nose.

It screeched an unholy sound as I step back readying my rifle before it shoots I guess shock waves from its mouth sending me flying out the door slamming into the wall on the other side of the room, Sydney and Ryan step forward raising their weapons before Sydney’s flys back barely missing me but not missing the wall and Ryan’s gun gets knocked out his hand as he reaches for his pistol, it grabs him screaming into his ear as he tries to fight its grasp but in a second he drops.

Thinking quick I grab Sydney and run out the room 

“So physical isn’t an option he overpowered Ryan in a second” Sydney says as we run towards the middle of the long hall looking for a spot to set up

“Yea we need to keep distance I say as we flip a bed in the hall and hunker down waiting for the creature to walk into sight”

“My nvgs broke” Sydney says frustrated 
“Switch to flashlights” I say flipping up the nvgs and clicking the button on the side of my rifle, the now lit hallway shows nothing but emptiness when we hear in a singsongy 
voice
 “what can Ms.Mary help you with” in a low scraggly voice which repeats over and over as we ready ourselves 

We see it enter the hall way as we take aim and light the bastard up, it drops for about 10 seconds before slowly picking itself up repeating “what can Ms.Mary help you with”

Rushing down the hall we switch mags as it runs towards us faster then any animal alive could, jumping to the side we see it rush pass us and stops we flick off our lights hoping it would conceal us as we slowly slide our back to the corner of the hall behind it when I drop the old spent mag I had previously just used when we see the creature not even flinch at the noise, noticing I lean down slowly and pick the mag up and preceded to throw it down the opposite direction and see the creature still hasn’t moved.

“I don’t think it can hear us” I whisper to Sydney as we now are speed walking backwards down the hall, when the creature starts to turn and look around presumably searching for us, slipping into a room we shut the door.

“How are we getting out of this one” Sydney says looking at the barred windows

“I have no clue” I say stepping towards the back wall

“One of us can try to distract it while the other lines up a shot” I say looking into her eyes wondering if after today I’ll ever be able to express how I feel about her

“Look I know it’s dumb to think about this right now especially with everything going on and it being against protocol, but how about a date if we make it out of this” I say cautiously 

“Sure, but you know that means we gotta kill this bitch” she says smiling 

“Okay” I say with new found confidence, I’ll go distract it, you line up the shot I say as I rush out the door, spraying shots at the creature down the opposite hall

Running towards the creature it stretches its mouth wider and sprints towards me screeching 
“WHAT CAN MS.MARY HELP YOU WITH!” 

Right before we collide in the middle of the hall I turn left shooting behind me as it chases me I hear Sydney’s feet running down the hall I just came from, diving to the ground In front of me I turn and spray the last of my mag into the creatures chest as Sydney runs up behind it stuffing the barrel to the back of its head and empty’s the gun.

The creature drops as we start reloading our weapons I pull out my pistol and put a few extra in just in case, we radio over “Ryan’s kia but we got the creature preceding towards the entrance to await the clean up crew” 

Walking away we hear a faint “wha- what can Ms.Mary help you with” spinning around the creature had already picked itself up and grabbed Sydney by the head lifting her up, charging the creature I scream “PUT HER DOWN!” I try to tackle the beast before being knocked away like I weigh less than a feather and slamming the side of my body so hard into the wall it cracks and breaks my arm.

“Yelling in pain I look to see the creature slowly rip Sydney’s head clean off as she screams and screams and then silence

Sobbing I lift myself up clinching my arm I sprint down the hall only looking back for a second but I wish I didn’t, it-it was eating her, I turn the corner and slam my good arm into the door busting out as soon as back up arrived but I don’t know how they fared against the creature, I passed out only after.

“I awoke to find myself back at home base and that’s everything I remember doc”

“Well Jax, it seems you were very lucky, will ignore your breach of protocol given the fact you watched her die in-front of you but next time don’t get so attached sgt”

“Yes sir” I said softly clicking off the recorder in my pocket 

“At least everyone can know your sacrifice Sydney” I whisper to myself before walking out.
