There was something in those woods. When the leaves fall softly swinging side to side in the air and the birds sing their sacred songs in different chirps and squawks, it stands, obstructed by trees and shrubs, watching with eyes full of malice.  That’s the impression that I got at least. When I first came across the creature I was fishing near the riverbed. It rained as if the ocean was above the forests the previous day and I wanted to cash in on the schools of fish just waiting to be fried or baked or sautéed. Gallons of water running with gentle crashes. The river, waists deep and cold but not freezing. Rays of light showering me with grace as if the heavens have granted me safety from all the things that were wrong in the world. Looking up I could see the trees receiving similar treatment, branches so clear I could count them all. Breathing in and the air feels refreshing, out and the lingering sensation stays. Never once have I feared what nature created. How could I when all the beauty in the world is because of this earth. The fauna, the great deep bodies of water, the majestic animals that roam. Things were far better here, and they always will be.

I’m sorry for that monologue. I have been living in these parts for the past twenty years now. I’m just sad that I had to leave, and in a hurry too. Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah.

It was on the other side of the river. I was there none the wiser, looking for some fish. Specifically, salmon since lemongrass and salmon were a flavor that was comparable to wagyu steak. Strike one and nothing. All I got was a spear stuck to the ground. It was a shock to find it stuck but that’s crude craftsmanship for you. Nothing but a knife and a stray tree branch. I tugged as hard as I could and I fell back into the water, my shirt and overalls getting instantly soaked as my back laid onto the river floor. Opening my eyes I saw a plethora of fish which made my accident more embarrassing. I got up, wiping excess water off my face and I readied myself. Second strike and nothing. Smashed the water I did. Nothing happened but I missed a great opportunity and now the fishes swam off some place. I still had high hopes though. Some of them weren’t as Squamish as I thought they were. I moved closer to the opposing side of the river, and I readied myself. So enveloped in focus and determination that I never once blinked or looked away. One, Two, Three. Third strike and bam. I finally caught something. Three bass and one salmon. I raised my hands swinging from side to side, hollering away and thrashing around. I finally caught something. Four somethings to say the least’s. I can make a hefty stew with these fishes. For an old fella like me a catch like this was like winning the lottery. Whenever I fished with a spear, I always just caught one. I still got it I said to myself. I’m eating good this supper. Potato wedges fried in deer fat with some lemongrass, onion, garlic, carrot, fish stew. One foot across the other. Making little dances while I walked out of the river.

Snap! What was that? I stood still for a couple of seconds. I wasn’t the only salmon lover in these woods. Plenty of bears walk along these rivers. I once saw one with its bear cub just a couple of miles north from here. With the abundance of the swimming delicacies, it wasn’t a stretch to see one so eager to steal my catch. So, I gripped my spear as tightly as I could, enough to make my hand red. If I’m going to die here, then I’d rather die a man.

At first there was nothing but vines, trees, and tall grass. Walking slowly, I maintained my stance with the same focus as before. Then the vines started to give way to something white and pointy, several more of these points showed themselves and they appeared to be connected to a furry, light brown base. It’s legs followed; it’s hooves making imprints on the soft mud of the water. It had a brown torso and a large neck almost like a giraffe. It was a deer. Not just any deer but a buck with huge antlers. Large enough to be half as tall as a tree. It’s eyes fixed on me. I froze, not out of fear but out of amazement and a hint of regret as I left my rifle and hunting knife at my cabin. I was looking across the river by then, so I didn’t really have the chance to kill it with my spear. Then again what difference would it make. If I killed it I would’ve had a rough time just carrying the damn thing to my base. I would also have to put my fish aside and I don’t want any stray critters getting even just a lick of my score.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

It sounded like a man on fire. The scream was so loud that near by birds flew away. It then ran towards me. Some of its movements were finnicky and loose. It’s as if all it’s muscles were shrinking. One of the steps made it’s ankle bend and snap with a meaty crunch. When it got it’s leg in the water I swear that every strand of fur just floated away leaving a greyish, reddish mass of muscle. You know how tenderloins have little strands that when cooked enough could separate. It looked like those strands were moving around like worms, jiggling and moving in quick succession the deeper it got in. By then the entire lower half of the deer was submerged and furless. The water wasn’t as clear and pristine as before as a cloud of grey surrounded the animal. Imagine a deer walking on a flight of stairs. Then imagine that every step it took it ages rapidly until it finally disintegrates into a pile of dusty black dirt. The same thing happened to this deer. It just went down and down and down. It’s screams getting loud and loud then soft and eventually silence. Only its antlers were poking out of the water. The grey stuff spread through the whole stretch of river eventually reaching beyond the eye could see. At that point I was thoroughly over dinner. The thought of the young buck’s eyes melting away from its sockets killed my appetite for the whole week.

During the trek home I found myself contemplating all the horrendous theories that I found plausible. Every meter traveled was another thought that drove me insane. I can’t use the river anymore, How am I supposed to live without a fresh water source?  Was that buck the only one that had that disease? Is it even a deer or was it just mimicking the last thing that it killed?

If that’s the case, then what if it kills a human?

The creature was a perfect imitation of a deer. From its antlers to it’s brown fur. A perfect imitation. I’ll never be able to eat meat ever again, I’ll never be able to trust any animal again, I’ll never be able to trust a person ever again. I’ll always imagine those wriggling masses of red strands crawling about in the water, masked only by the grey shit that came off the corpse. I’ll have to rely on my crops. My small vegetable patches of potatoes, carrots, onions, and garlics. What if they find a way to inflict their disgusting tendrils on my harvest? What then?

When I reached my cabin, I immediately blocked every nook and cranny of my humble abode. Every piece of firewood I stocked up for the winter, every tree in my area, everything that I could put between me and that thing was used to secure my base. If any of those worms managed to even get half of their bodies in, then they’ll be greeted by lead. After barricading I rested, hugging my Remington, my last hope for survival.

A few hours passed. I struggle to keep my eyes wide. Thinking of using my fingers to forcefully open my eyelids I reached my face but then I thought to myself. What if these things were bacterial? The only thing that could wash your hands is dirty. Thoughts like these are unpleasant but any precaution is necessary. At this point I thought I was going senile. A sixty-five-year-old man living in the woods for twenty years with nothing, but a hand axe, a hunting knife, and a Remington point twenty-two for company. Maybe that’s a good thing, dying here in this place that I’ve called home. Even if it means turning into one of them. Damn I have gone senile. If I really am then there’s nothing to really worry about. I can die surrounded by the only friends I have, the trees. Maybe this is God’s way of saying it’s time. I’ve accepted it at this point in my life. I have no children or wife to write to, and I certainly have no regrets.

Several hours passed. Snap, the sound of a branch echoing across from me. Releasing me from my half sleeping stupor. Then another snap, and a crunch. It came from every direction. Becoming louder and louder as they get closer and closer. Rifle at hand I ready myself like a fisherman using a spear. Kneeling on one knee and steadying my aim running in my head the scenarios that could come up. A possible break in or a possible break in. The only thing I was really prepared for was if they broke in. Eyes wide, hand axe at my right side ready for any melee combat, ammo on the left if I ever need to eat one. Watching and waiting for the right time.

“Oh Say, can you see” BAM!

The force of a hundred fists dropped me to the floor.

“By the dawn's early light” BAM!

All the walls were shaking knocking off my wooden sculptures and furniture.

“What so proudly we hailed” BAM!

They were breaking my barricades and destroying my walls whilst singing, pronouncing every syllable with a metallic coldness.

“At the twilight's last gleaming?” BAM!

A bump appeared on all the walls, then simultaneously they all got bigger with every thud, until they burst into the walls.

“Whose broad stripes and bright stars” BAM!

Their fists oozing blood, gripping and squirming to grab anything, anything to infect, anything organic so that they could increase their numbers.

“Through the perilous fight” BAM!

At that point I started blasting every arm stopping them momentarily before continuing.

“O'er the ramparts we watched” BAM!

Aiming at every arm and firing every round I was left with my only bullet.

“Were so gallantly, yeah, streaming?” BAM!

I shoved the barrel in my mouth after loading the last round. If they get in I’ll do it, if they get in I’ll do it, If they get in I’ll do it, If they get in I’ll do it, If they get in I’ll do it, If they get in I’ll do it, If they get in I’ll do it, If they get in I’ll do it, If they get in I’ll do it, If they get in I’ll do it.

BANG! “Hey assholes! Come get some!!!” BANG! BANG! BANG!

A collective silence. Then marching in a rhythmic manner. One and two and three and four. Other bangs soon followed. Their collective footsteps marching farther until silence returned. A calm befell me, and I slumped over myself in the fetal position. I was a little hesitant to sleep but my body said otherwise. When I woke up the cabin was littered with hundreds of holes from the roof to the lowest parts of the walls. I gathered my things and waltz carefully outside pointing my rifle at every corner I turned. It wouldn’t really help as much considering the lack of damage my gun made to these things but heck maybe a head shot would stop these things.

Everything was clear. The holes were still there, and the deep footprints of the things were scattered across my shack. This wasn’t a manic episode as I hoped it was. These footprints all were facing my compound in a tight circle and then they all went to one direction.

The river. They all went and marched towards death. Maybe the mysterious gunman knew their weakness and lured them to water. I hope he was ok, but hope isn’t going to cut it in this world. I want to make sure if those things weren’t out there anymore. To have a clear to live my life the way it used to be.

I don’t know why I went back. I told myself that it was for my safety. Something to confirm that the threat was gone and I could presume like nothing ever happened. A part of me was curious. What happened to my saving grace after that terrible night, did he get eaten or something? Did he turn into one of them? I don’t know and I’m going to find out even if it costs me my life. Looking back, it was a stupid thing to do but I came out of it ok, so it wasn’t all that stupid.

When I got to the river the first thing I saw was my own reflection. The water was as clear as day and the fishes didn’t seem to mind. The second thing I saw was the massive group of floating bones and camo lined clothes across the water. When I looked closer, I could see multiple combat vests and firearms stuck in sand and dirt. The antlers were still poking out.

I never looked back. I just got up and left. I followed the same route I used when I first came to these parts and booked it.

It’s been about a week now. My savings deposit was still operational, and I managed to rent myself a shabby apartment complex. There’s plenty of new weird things to adjust to. Just last week I ran into a weird Japanese looking robot delivering food while I was working my graveyard shift at my local seven eleven. Lots of weird technologies and customs to abide. I miss those damn woods already.
