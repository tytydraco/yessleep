The other day, my son Alex visited from college. It’s his sophomore year, and up until then he’d been planning to go into computer science like me. That’s when he told me he wanted to sit down and talk man to man. So even though he’s not quite 21, I poured him a bit of my good scotch and we sat down in my study.

“I’m switching to environmental science,” he blurted out after a few seconds. “I know that’s not what you want, but I think it’s what I need to do. If you feel like I’m letting you down, I totally understand. If you want to stop paying my tuition, I get that too. It’s just–”

I held up my hand.

“It’s fine,” I said. “Don’t say you’re sorry. If anything, I should be apologizing for making you think I’d be upset.” I motioned over to a poster that had been hanging on my wall for a few decades, an old black and white photo of William Carlos Williams with a quote beneath that read, *“It is difficult to get the news from poems yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there.”*

He nodded like he understood. The thing with the quote was that it couldn’t *really* sink in until you’d lived a bit. Twenty years just wasn’t long enough to see the way life grinds your friends to dust. Sure, Alex had experienced the sharp pains of a few sudden losses, but he didn’t know the truth of entropy yet, the desperation of decades, slowly watching your soul leak out.

“I’m going to tell you a story now,” I said. “It’s a true story. You can believe it or not. That’s up to you.”

I found my hand was shaking a little as I set my glass of scotch down on the table. I had never told anyone the story, not even my wife. It lived in a dark corner of my mind that I preferred not to visit. But it seemed important that I tell Alex now.

I began to tell Alex the story:

When I was a little older than you, my sister Nina and I took a spring break road trip, driving back from L.A. all the way home to New Mexico. I was a couple years out of school, and she was a senior, majoring in poetry. Personally, I thought the whole thing was a joke, but I was young, a little bit sexist. I figured if she couldn’t get a job with a poetry degree, she’d end up getting married and just being a mom. Nothing wrong with that.

As for me, I had a little bit of change in my pocket for the first time in my life. Money was basically all I thought about. Even if I was thinking about girls, it was about how I’d find a better, hotter one if I had more cash. Like I said, I was young and stupid. It was how I thought back then.

“You should listen to this album,” said Nina. She popped a Smiths CD into the player and cranked up the volume.

“It’s a little loud,” I said.

“It’s poetry.”

“I’m trying to drive.”

She turned it down a hair and then sang along as the music blasted. To be honest, I hated it. The whole album seemed equal parts pretentious and whiny. Honestly, it made me worry my sister was going to end up with a guy like the singer, penniless and way too in touch with his emotions.

“You got a plan for after school’s done?” I asked.

“I think I need a break,” she said. “I’ve got a friend who’s going backpacking through South America. She might stop and work at a hotel or something, maybe learn Spanish as she goes. I’m thinking of going with her. Probably safer, two girls together.”

“And then what?”

“Hard to say,” she said. “I guess I’ll have a lot of time to think about it while we’re traveling.”

“That’s not a plan.”

We argued like that, back and forth as we drove east. At some point, the sun fell behind us and everything got dark. Even though it was night, it was still a hundred degrees outside. I kept checking my gauges, making sure we didn’t overheat. We were on a long stretch of the 10 between Tuscon and El Paso, a million miles from any real civilization.

Suddenly, I saw something dart across the freeway up ahead. At first I thought it was a deer, but it was too small. I slammed on the breaks, almost skidding off the road. I came to a stop maybe twenty feet in front of the figure, only now realizing it was a little girl. She was maybe eight or nine and wearing an old-fashioned dress, dripping wet.

“Stay in the car,” I told Nina. “I’ll see what’s going on.”

She put a hand on my wrist.

“Don’t,” she said.

“There’s no one out here for miles. She’s going to need help.”

In the meantime, the little girl stared in at us from in front of the car. Her color was all washed out from my brights, but it didn’t seem to bother her eyes. It was like she was staring right through us, unblinking.

I stepped outside and walked up to the girl. She was shivering despite the heat, and she smelled of salt, like she’d just stepped out of the ocean, though it was a hundred miles away.

“Do you need help?” I asked. For some reason, I found myself keeping my distance, keeping the car door between us.

“Sing me a song,” she said quietly. “I’ve been awake ever so long. I can’t sleep without my lullaby.”

“I can get you to the next town,” I said. “Or do you have a house out here nearby? Parents around?”

She smiled and shook her head.

“You’re very kind,” she said. “But I don’t want any of those things. Just a song please. It doesn’t have to be a lullaby, if you don’t know one. Any song will do.”

“Just sing to her,” whispered Nina from inside the car. “And then let’s go.”

The little girl took a step toward me. As she did, I saw that she left wet footprints on the hot freeway behind her. Wet lines of mucus were running down her nose, further wetting her too-white skin.

“It’s very quiet in the water,” she said. “Much too quiet. None of the fish have anything to say. Sing me a song. Maybe a new song. I hear there are so many new songs these days but no one sings to me.”

I racked my brain. I’d listened to a few Pink Floyd albums in high school but not like my friends who could sing along to every lyric. It had just never seemed that interesting to me. Music was a waste of time.

The girl took another step toward me. When she smiled, she opened her mouth wide, and I saw that it was full of water and wet seaweed. The salty smell hit much harder now. I could practically hear the ocean in her rattling breath.

“Happy birthday to you,” I started singing, trying to ignore the panic rising in my chest. “Happy–”

“Not that one,” she said, her smile suddenly gone. “No more birthdays. Never again.”

“It’s the only one I know,” I said. She took another step, reaching the other side of the car door. And then with one tiny finger she flicked the window glass, and it shattered, falling to bits at my feet. I tried to take a step back and fell to the ground. I scrambled back and felt a pain in my palm as glass sliced into it.

At the smell of blood, the girl’s eyes lit up. She pushed at the car door, and her slightest tough slammed it shut. She stood over me, steam coming off her in the hot night air, licking her lips.

“I wish you’d had a song to sing me,” she said. “I might have loved it. I would have sung it all the way home, every step back to the ocean.”

She reached forward with two hands, placing them on either side of my head. She began to press, and the pressure was insane, like nothing I’d ever felt, the way the ocean must press in at you when you’re a thousand feet deep.

And just then, I heard a voice singing,

*I am the son*

*And the heir*

*Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar*

*I am the son and heir*

*Of nothing in particular.*

Nina was standing behind me, singing her stupid Smiths song into the hot night air. As she did, the girl stood and began to dance. When the verse repeated, she mouthed the words quietly to herself. Soon, she was twirling and smiling, shaking her wet hair, filing saltwater into the night. And then, as Nina sang the last word, the girl bowed and walked off into the darkness.

I stood up and began to pick the glass from my hand. After a few minutes, I realized I was crying. And then Nina came and hugged me tight.

I poured myself another glass of scotch, then filled up Alex’s cup too.

"I ended up paying for that trip Nina wanted to take down south,” I said. “When she came back, she ended up going to grad school in New Jersey. On my thirtieth birthday, she sent me that poster, and I’ve had it on my wall ever since. Of course, by then I'd already started to change the way I approached my life. Still, it was a good reminder."

Alex finished his drink and looked up at me, his eyes large. He looked sick.

“I’ve seen her too,” he said quietly. “When I was a kid. Sometimes, I’d wake up at night, and I’d look out the window, and I’d see her there. I still remember the salt smell. And I’d scream and I’d scream and I’d scream for you. And you always came. You always ran in, and you never left without singing me a song. [By the time you stopped singing, she was always gone](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).”
