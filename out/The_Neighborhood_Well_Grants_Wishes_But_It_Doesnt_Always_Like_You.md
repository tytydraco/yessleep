The neighborhood I reside in now is the nicest place I’ve ever lived. Beautifully kept- with trees so vibrant and skies so clear, you’d think someone had turned up the saturation. Not only that, but this place has one extra perk that trumps them all.

No one ever used to use it. From what I can understand, it’s a gamble- and a very expensive one at that.

I also know there's something alive under my neighborhood. No one here has ever seen whatever or whoever it is, but we all know it's there. 

Superstitions have never had any hold on me. Walking under a ladder, breaking a mirror, and black cats were no more special to me than any other mundane aspect of my life. Sure, I thought the idea of it was cute- a story to inject a little bit of magic into the lives of children- but, just like Santa Claus, there was no truth behind them in my eyes.

It's the reason I was so surprised when I moved to my new neighborhood- the one with the wishing well behind the old church. I could see it from my window- sitting abandoned across the street. 

Even as a child, I understood that the purpose of fairy tales was to bring joy, mystery, or some other moral lesson to the listeners. They were a positive thing. 

So, why then did everyone here act like this? Why is it a taboo to even speak about the well? 

The day I moved in, there was no welcoming party. No friendly neighbors to greet me like in my old town. There was only a note taped to my front door, and even that was blunt, 

“You will only be warned once. The well is not to be used. Stay away from it.”

It wasn't signed or addressed, but I chalked it up to a crazy neighbor. It didn’t take long for me to forget all about it.

This suburban town was a lot quieter than the city life I had come from, but I didn't mind it. I kept to myself, mostly. Always have. Easier that way, especially after things fell apart with my sister. We hadn’t spoken in years.

The neighbors were friendly and despite living alone, I never felt lonely. There was nothing out of the ordinary- with the exception of that one small, looming detail.

Anytime the well was mentioned, no matter by who, people's smiles would drop like a sinking stone. The subject would immediately be changed and if it wasn’t, people would simply excuse themselves from the conversation. I learned this the hard way when I made the mistake of asking about the well at a barbecue I had been invited to. 

I may as well have insulted the dead, the way everyone stared. My host pulled me aside to another room, I could hear the chattering continue as soon as I left. They explained to me only that the well was not up for conversation. I asked why, and I was then asked to leave.

From that day on I figured I’d play along. I mean, everyone was friendly enough and I didn’t really care about the well. Why not just let it be?

The next week, that same neighbor invited me out for coffee-two towns over. I found it annoying. I wasn’t in the mood to socialize, and they knew I had nothing else going on that day, which made it hard to come up with an excuse without seeming rude. Still, curiosity won out.

That’s when I finally got something-some version of the truth, anyway. It wasn’t much. Vague, cautious, and watered down. But it was more than anyone else had been willing to say.

In a hushed voice, they told me people here are afraid of the well. It’s older than the neighborhood. Older than the church. Maybe even older than the town itself. No one maintains it-no one dares-yet it never changes. The bricks never crumble. Plants don’t grow over it. There’s no mold, no moss. Even the birds won’t perch on its edge.

I didn’t believe a word of it.

Ironically, I think my unbelief in the supernatural is what saved me from it at first.

It started with a man a few houses down. I didn’t know him well, but I’d seen him out on his porch most days-usually with a drink in hand and a tired look in his eyes. One day, he stopped showing up. A neighbor whispered that he’d lost his job. Another said he was about to lose the house too.

Then, one night, someone saw him at the well. Drunk. Talking to it like it was a priest or a god or an old friend. He tossed a coin down and made a wish.

A week later, he won the lottery. Half a million dollars. Just like that.

No one said it out loud-not at first. But everyone knew. The timing was too perfect. The man who’d been sleeping in his car was now driving a brand-new SUV. Wearing a gold watch. Talking about moving to Florida.

It took time, but slowly… people started getting brave.

A coin. A wish. A new car in the driveway.

A coin. A wish. A promotion no one had seen coming.

A coin. A wish. A woman who’d been in hospice walked out of her house two weeks later, smiling like nothing had ever been wrong.

No one ever admitted it. No one talked about it. But the silence in this neighborhood started to feel different. Not cautious… expectant.
Like everyone was waiting their turn. 

The tricky part about gambling is that it is a trick in and of itself. A game of russian roulette. But the rewards were too sweet to resist. 

The next wish didn’t go as well. 

I actually knew this one personally. Dale. He lived at the very end of the street. 

The kind of man who owned three cars and made sure you knew about each of them. Loud voice, louder opinions. People saw him that night, dressed too nice for a midnight stroll. Holding a coin the size of a silver dollar. He made a big show of dropping it in.

The next morning, his front door was wide open, swinging on its hinges. The inside looked like a tornado had blown through the house. Shattered glass littered the floor, the furniture was overturned and torn, and a trail of dark streaks led from the stairs to the door. They smelled like mud and mildew. 

No one has seen Dale since. We did, however, find his wedding ring caked in mud on the ground outside.

I should mention that, the morning Dale disappeared, there was a 4th car in his driveway: a bright blue Bugatti Veyron. Brand new. Clean. Keys still in the ignition. Expensive even for someone like him. 

After Dale, things went quiet again.

No more coins. No more wishes.

The Bugatti sat in his driveway for a week before it disappeared-towed in the middle of the night by someone no one seemed to recognize. No paperwork. No questions.

People stopped talking about the well entirely. Conversations grew stiff when it came up, then stopped altogether. Barbecues resumed. Lawns were trimmed. Porch lights flicked on at the usual times.

It was as if Dale had never existed.

That was the rhythm of this place. A quick flirtation with the forbidden, followed by complete, willful silence. No one warned newcomers anymore. They just watched-waited to see who would get curious first.

I never intended for that to be me, but my mind was made for me.

I got the call late at night: a drunk driver, an intersection, and my sister. She was alive, for now, but in critical condition. 

I rushed to the hospital to see her, but they wouldn’t let me in the room. They gave me the usual spiel. “We’re doing everything we can.” 

But I saw it in their eyes. She was a goner.

The drive home felt unreal. I loved my sister, despite the silence, despite the petty fight. I never stopped. I just never said it.

The doctor’s words rang in my head again. “Doing all we can.” But I wasn’t. 

There was still one thing I hadn’t done. One thing I could still do.

The rest of my drive home was spent calculating and justifying what I knew I was going to do next.

Five wishes had been made. Of those, only one ended badly.

A one-in-five chance to save her.

It was past midnight by the time I pulled into the driveway.

The neighborhood was still. No wind, no barking dogs, not even the distant hum of cars. Just that heavy kind of silence that feels like it’s listening.

I stood outside my front door for a long time, keys in hand, staring across the yard.

The well sat behind the church, tucked just beyond the fence line. It was barely visible from my house-just a ring of brick swallowed in shadow. But tonight, I could see it clearly. As if it wanted to be seen.

I didn’t go inside.

I walked.

Each step felt heavier than the last, like the air thickened the closer I got. The grass underfoot was damp even though it hadn’t rained in days. The church loomed to my right, its windows dark. I half expected to see someone watching me from inside-but there was nothing.

Just me and the well.

I reached into my pocket and found a coin I hadn’t remembered putting there. A dull penny. I almost laughed. My sister's life, in exchange for this? But it wasn’t about the coin. It never was. 
I stepped forward. Cleared my throat.
My voice shook, but I forced the words out.
“I want my sister to live.”
The coin dropped.
There was no sound. No splash. Just an endless silence.
I backed away from the well slowly, like with a wild animal, and spent the rest of the night by my phone, waiting for a call. 

I didn’t sleep.

I sat on the couch with the curtains cracked just enough to see outside. The well was just a silhouette-unmoving, undisturbed. I watched it like a hawk, as if it might change its mind and spit the coin back out.

I started writing this sometime around 3 a.m., while I was still waiting for the hospital to call. I didn’t know if I’d ever get the call, or if something else would happen first. I just needed to get it all down-just in case.

The phone finally rang just after 6 a.m.

I fumbled it to my ear before the second ring. My heart was already halfway out of my chest.

It was the hospital.

She was awake.

Stable. Breathing on her own. Responding to questions.

The nurse called it a miracle.

I didn’t speak for a full ten seconds. Just held the phone to my ear and listened to the sound of the universe tipping sideways.

I thanked them. I don’t remember what else I said. I just know I was smiling when I hung up.

And then I looked out the window.

Someone is peeking over the wall of the well-looking me right in the eyes. Skin white like paper. Bloated, like a waterlogged corpse. Every few minutes it moves a little-an inch here, a twitch there-but it never stops staring.

It’s leaving the well slowly.
A hand over the edge.
Then an arm.
Now I can see its mouth. Or the beginning of it, anyway.

It’s vertical.
It starts at its lips and runs down its throat, a long seam that splits its head in half. I can’t see how far it goes. I’m sure I’ll find out very soon.

I already tried running.
When I went to the door, it was there.

I saw it through the peephole. Just standing on the other side, gasping-bubbling like something drowning in its own breath. Its skin dripped black water that pooled on my porch.

But when I backed away, panicked, and looked out the window again-
it was still by the well.

My front porch was empty.

Unlucky as it is, I made this gamble. My sister gets to live and that’s what’s important. I just hope she sees this so she can know I’m sorry.
