I’m sharing this here because I don't know what else to do. I guess I should just begin at the start, I was driving down a local street and spotted a garage sale. I had moved in recently so I decided to stop by. I looked around for a while until I found a leather notebook and I just felt.. Attracted. I'm not sure why but I went to the front and bought it. I drove home and decided I should see what was in it. Here is what I read…

I am dedicating this journal to my ventures in the world of cryptozoology. I'm taking a 14-day trip up to Washington, recently there was a sighting in Woodland County and I want to investigate. I bought some equipment and booked a cabin. I'm on the plane right now, I will write more in the morning.

Feb 20
I arrived at my cabin this morning. It's pretty secluded in the woods. The trees are beautiful, they are tall and bushy. There's a grocery store only 6 miles away. I got some groceries from the store and I set up my expedition supplies.  Tomorrow I'm going out on my first expedition. I'm very excited.

Feb 21
I just got back from my expedition. I saw a few deers but not many. Pretty cold outside but it was nice being outside. I went up to a tree near a river.  Some good news: I got in contact with the witness. They said they would be happy to meet up. Until then I'm going back out. Wish me luck!

Feb 22
I just got back again. Still nothing though I did see some bones! I'm going to look at them tomorrow. Interestingly the witness has become skittish. They said they had a weird feeling. Like someone was watching them. Anyways, wish me luck!

Feb 23 
I did it! I was up in the tree when I saw it! It was walking not too far and I snapped a picture. He was big the size of some small trees brown and furry. So cool! Though it seemed like it noticed and it looked at me. his eyes were emerald green. I got a really good photo of this! I can't wait! After this trip, I'm going to share it with the press! And some better news they agreed to interview tomorrow!

Feb 24
The interview went interesting. He said that recently he felt as if he was being stalked. And the feeling of being looked at increased. He even swore he thought he saw Bigfoot in his yard. It was odd. Even there he was nervous. He kept looking around and at one point he just straight up left. He said he had to do something. As I'm writing this I hear some odd noises outside but it is quite windy. I'm sure it's fine. Though. I don't think I want to go out tomorrow. 

P.S.
I'm writing this at 12:45 at night. He just sent me a text. I don't know what to say. All I can do is tell you what he said. “JAMES I NEED YOU TO LISTEN TO ME BIGFOOT HE NOT JUST A MONSTER HE’S AN APEX PREDATOR HE SMART HE FOLLOWING ME I JUST SAW HIM IN MY BACK I TRIED TO RUN OUT THE FRONT IT WAS BARRICADED HE FOLLOWED ME HOME I DO KNOW HOW LONG I HOLD WAIT NO THE DOORS BREA-” …

I was woken up by to knock on my door. It was the police. The witness is missing. They questioned me and left. I know this is going to be my last entry. He's watching me. I saw him outside. On his shoulder, I see a small chunk of damage. I'm assuming he tried to shoot it. He was right. He is the apex predator. We both know this. I'm sorry. If you're reading this. my boy Ted or Carrie, I love you. And I must warn you DO NOT make my mistake. DO NOT go after big feet. For your safety. And to you bigfoot I know you will find this. FUCK YOU.



I don't know what to do. I'm posting this to honor this man and as a warning. On the page with the picture, the photo was ripped out. And if you are Carrie or Ted contact me
