Hi everyone! This is a bit awkward, but I'm in a bit of trouble and urgently need help. Does anyone in Far Water have a shovel I can borrow? I know it sounds strange, but preferably one that can… um… seal gaps? I mean, figuratively, seal gaps! For gardening! You know, sometimes you need to compact the soil to prevent things from leaking out, I mean, to prevent plants from growing out of the soil. It's a very specific gardening task.



I would be extremely grateful if you could. If possible, I can arrange for someone to pick it up tonight. It's urgent.



Please DM me if you can help!



Kiss, Louise💖



Edit: Okay, I should explain the situation. This is actually a pretty funny story! Well, not the kind that makes you laugh out loud, but the kind of "Oh my god, how did my life get like this?" kind of funny. Let me start from the beginning…



I think I should formally introduce myself. My name is Louise, I'm twenty-eight years old, I have a trust fund, but honestly, nothing special.



Six months ago, I met John through my best friend, diana. Well, I said "best friend," but to be honest, I've been a little confused by diana lately. Sometimes she looks at me with a calculating glint in her carefully crafted eyes. But I'm probably just being paranoid; it's one of my flaws—I always think the worst. Of course, except when I think the best, and most of the time I do. You know, I always try to please people. Always.



diana introduced us at one of those dreaded charity dinners I'm always dragged to. "Louise, darling," she whispered, her long hand on my elbow, "you absolutely have to meet John. He's perfect for you."



Oh, he really is perfect. He was six feet two inches tall, with jet-black hair falling perfectly across his forehead, and eyes as deep as aged whiskey. His smile made my legs weak—a little embarrassing to admit, but I've always been the kind of person whose legs go weak easily. Especially after three glasses of champagne, which I'd had exactly three when diana introduced us.



“Louise,” he said, taking my hand and kissing it lightly, as if we were in a Victorian romance novel. “What a beautiful name.”



I giggled. Really giggled, like a little girl，I wasn't proud of it, but I had to admit, my two biggest weaknesses were being easily flustered and falling in love quickly when drunk, and embarrassingly quickly at that. It was a terrible combination. My therapist said I had “boundary issues” and that “this pattern of developing attachments before being sure someone is trustworthy is worrying.” But what did she know? She'd never seen John smile.



“Thank you,” I stammered, my cheeks already flushed. “Your name… it’s a name too. A good name!”



Such a smooth talker, Louise. So smooth.



But John just laughed, a warm, genuine laugh that made me feel like the most charming woman in the room, not the most awkward. “You’re lovely,” he said. “I’d love to invite you to dinner sometime. If you’re not taken yet?”



I should mention that I’ve been single for eight months now, since my ex-boyfriend Daniel disappeared. But we’ll talk about Daniel later, Daniel… it’s complicated.



“I’m not taken!” I practically shouted, drawing stares from people at nearby tables. “I mean, no, I’m single, very single, very free.”



Diana laughed from behind her champagne glass, while I wanted nothing more than to collapse on the dance floor and die. But John just laughed even brighter and asked for my phone number. I gave it to him, silently praying that I hadn’t mixed up the numbers under the influence of the champagne.



He called the next day. The third day too. Soon we were dating，official dates, dinners, weekend plans, and he called me "his girl" with that possessive tone. It was incredibly romantic.



The problem was, John wasn't like any of the men I'd dated before. First of all, he was penniless. Well, not entirely penniless; he had a job in "business consulting" and seemed to spend most of his time on the phone and eating expensive lunches, which I usually paid for. But compared to my trust fund, he was practically broke.



"Do you mind?" I asked him once, about a month into our relationship. We were in my penthouse, and I watched him pour himself a drink.



"What is it?" he asked, then came over and sat on the custom-made Italian sofa.



"I have…you know." I glanced around the apartment, embarrassed to say the word "money." 



John smiled and pulled me closer. “Baby, I love you for who you are, not for your bank account. Money is just… a nice extra income.”



I nestled in his arms, ignoring the faint voice deep inside me, a voice that sounded like my therapist saying, “Louise, this is the biggest red flag I’ve ever heard.”



But I love him! I really love him! Love conquers all, doesn’t it? All the movies say that. The poor guy wins the heart of the beautiful girl, overcomes their differences, and lives happily ever after in her penthouse while he continues his unreliable “business consulting” job.



Everything was perfect. Absolutely perfect.



Until he suggested a trip.



It was a Monday, I remember it clearly. I always try to be away from home on the first day of the month because watching someone else clean my house makes me feel awkward. John and I were having brunch at my favorite little restaurant.



“I’ve been thinking,” John said in that typically nonchalant tone a man uses when about to offer a suggestion that’s anything but casual. “We should go somewhere. Just the two of us.”



“Oh?” I said, carefully cutting my gold-leaf omelet. “Where are you thinking? Paris? The Maldives? I know a great resort in Bali—”



“Actually,” he interrupted, “I’d like somewhere more…private. Secluded, away from the hustle and bustle.”



I paused, my fork still at my lips. “Secluded?”



“Yeah, you know. No distractions. No cell phones. Just the two of us.” He reached across the table, took my hand, and traced circles on my palm with his thumb,a gesture that often made me forget who I was. “Don’t you own a property somewhere secluded? I think you mentioned a villa?”



I did own a villa. "Well, strictly speaking, it was my great-aunt Meredith's villa, but she gave it to me when she died. The cause of her death was mysterious, and no one in the family wants to talk about it. It's practically the middle of nowhere,I mean really the middle of nowhere,surrounded by dense forest, accessible only by a long, winding dirt road that hasn't been maintained since the 1970s."



"Oh, you mean that villa," I said suddenly, lowering my voice. "John, I think..."



"Come on, baby. It'll be romantic. Just you and me, away from the hustle and bustle." His eyes softened and pleaded, and I felt my resolve crumble like a sandcastle at high tide.



"I don't know. It's too remote. There's no cell phone signal. And I think the heating's broken. To be honest, John, I really don't want to go..."



"Please?" He squeezed my hand. "For me?"



That's it. My biggest weakness. The people I love beg me to do something "for them," as if my comfort and desires were more important than theirs. And, to be honest, in my eyes, they always have been.



“Okay,” I heard myself say, even though every cell in my body was screaming, “No, no, no!” 



“We can go to the villa.”I said.



John’s face lit up with a Christmas morning smile. “Great! I’ll arrange everything. We can leave on Friday.”



“Friday?” I exclaimed. “We have less than 3 days left!”



“Opportunity knocks but once, right?” He grinned and kissed my hand. “Trust me, Louise. Everything will be perfect.”



The drive to the villa took six hours, most of which I clung tightly to the door handle, trying not to think about those horror movies that start with couples heading to remote locations. John was enthusiastic, humming along to the radio, occasionally pinching my hands. He probably thought it would reassure me,but I wanted nothing more than to jump out of the moving car.



“This feels great!” he kept saying, “Just the two of us, no one to bother us.”



“Hmm,” I responded, my gaze sweeping over the increasingly dense forest on either side of the road. “Wow.”



When we finally arrived at the villa, it looked like a scene from a Gothic horror novel. It was a three-story Victorian building, crumbling, with a lookout tower on the roof, weathered shutters, and several crows that looked like real ones perched on it. The garden had been overgrown with weeds for years, roses and ivy so dense they seemed to be threatening to devour the entire building.



“Wow,” John said, a phrase that could have many meanings. My mood plummeted from “This is amazing” to “We’re definitely going to die here.”



“I told you this house needed repairs,” I said apologetically, as if it were my fault my villa looked like the Bates Motel. “We could turn back. There’s a great hotel about an hour’s drive ahead…”



“No. This is perfect.” John had already gotten out of the car and stretched. “It has…atmosphere.”



Atmosphere. That was one way to describe it. “A nightmare” was another word that came to mind, but I didn’t say it aloud.



We unloaded our luggage，or rather, I unloaded my four suitcases, while John carried only his single travel bag. I opened the heavy wooden door with that ridiculously large key that looked like it stepped out of a fairy tale. The interior of the villa was slightly better than the exterior, mainly because I'd hired a cleaning company last week. But the air of confinement still lingered, like the smell of old books and secrets.



“I’ll start a fire,” John said, heading towards the massive stone fireplace in the living room. “Why don’t you get us some wine?”



“Because I’m not your servant,” I thought. “Of course, darling!” I blurted out.



“It’s alright,” I told myself as I rummaged through the wine cellar. Yes, this villa had a wine cellar, even with cobwebs. This was a romantic getaway with my boyfriend. Nothing strange about it. Everything was normal.



As I carried several bottles full of wine (because I couldn’t decide which one to bring and didn’t want to upset John with my choice) upstairs, I felt it for the first time.



A feeling of being watched.



I froze on the stairs, the bottles clinking softly. A sharp pain shot through the back of my neck, and a premonition, ingrained in my ancient lizard instincts, washed over me: something was very wrong. I slowly turned and looked down, only to see the darkness of the cellar shrouding everything.



Nothing. Only shadows, wine racks, and that distinctive smell of earth and stone.



“Louise, you’re just imagining things,” I muttered to myself, “there’s nothing there.”



But I quickened my pace and went upstairs, my heart pounding, though it had nothing to do with the movement itself.



The feeling wouldn’t go away.



For the next two days, I couldn’t shake the feeling: something, or rather, someone, was watching the villa. More precisely, watching me. The feeling was especially strong at night; the old house creaked and groaned around us, as if whispering, and the wind rustled through the trees outside the window.



“Did you hear that?” I asked John, sitting bolt upright for the seventeenth time. “It’s just that something’s off with the house, Louise,” he said without even opening his eyes. “Go back to sleep.”



But it wasn’t just the house. I knew it wasn’t. There were signs. Small things, John dismissed, but I couldn’t ignore them. There were footprints in the garden that weren’t ours. I distinctly remembered closing the window, but it was open the next morning. I had a feeling someone had been in the kitchen, even though John swore he hadn’t gotten up the night before.



“You’re being too sensitive,” John said the next day, bringing up the footprints again. We were eating breakfast，or rather, I was eating breakfast; John was eating the breakfast I’d made for him, head down, playing on his phone.



“I’m not being too sensitive,” I insisted, hating the complaining and apologetic tone in my voice. “I really feel like someone’s outside.” John sighed, put down his phone, and looked miserable. “Louise, baby. There’s no one outside. We’re in the middle of nowhere. Who would be following you?”



“I don’t know! But I have this feeling. I feel like someone’s watching me.”



“Watching you.” His tone was flat, tinged with suspicion. “Louise, I love you, but you need to calm down. This was supposed to be a romantic trip, and you’ve turned it into a horror movie.”



“I’m sorry,” I said instinctively, because I always say that. “You’re right. I might just be overthinking things.”



“You are overthinking things,” he said, glancing down at his phone. “Now, could you make some more coffee? This one’s getting cold.”



I stood by the coffee machine. The kitchen in this villa was very modern, one of the few things my great-aunt kept up with. I tried to convince myself that John was right. I was being paranoid. There was no one outside. Those footprints were probably from animals. The open window was probably just my imagination. The things that had been moved in the kitchen were probably…



Well, I couldn’t explain the kitchen thing. “I’m sorry,” I said, handing John the freshly brewed coffee. “I know I’ve been a little selfish. It’s just that…”



“Since what?” John asked, unusually looking up at me.



I bit my lip. I hadn’t told John about Daniel. In fact, I hadn’t told anyone about Daniel except diana, and even Diana didn’t know the whole truth.



“Since my ex-boyfriend Daniel disappeared,” I said softly.



John’s eyebrows shot up. “Disappeared? What do you mean, disappeared?”



“That’s it. He disappeared. Eight months ago. He was here one day, and the next day he… was gone.” I hugged myself tighter, feeling a sudden chill despite the warm kitchen. “The police said he might have just left town. Said he had some financial difficulties, so he ran away. But I don’t know. It feels… wrong.”



“Hmm.” John seemed to be processing this information. “It’s really strange.”



“It’s making me a little paranoid,” I admitted. “My therapist said it’s post-traumatic hypervigilance.” Ever since Daniel disappeared, I’ve had a bad feeling, a constant sense that something terrible is about to happen.



Indeed, it is. But what I didn’t say was that this paranoia was so intense because of something that happened when Daniel disappeared，Special circumstances. These circumstances relate to our last conversation, which ended in an argument. A terrible argument. The kind of argument where words, once spoken, cannot be taken back.



The kind of argument that ultimately led to someone's disappearance.



But I didn't want to think about it. I promised myself I wouldn't.



"Relax," John said, standing up and stretching. "I'm going to take a shower. Maybe you should go for a walk, clear your head."



"Go for a walk? Go outside? Go where there are footprints?"



"Yeah, it'll do you good." "Get some fresh air." He gave my forehead a casual kiss and went upstairs, leaving me alone with coffee, thoughts, and a growing premonition: something very, very wrong.



I didn't go for a walk.



Instead, I did what any sane person would do: I checked every lock on every door and window, made sure the kitchen knives were within reach (just in case), and then sat with my back against the wall in the living room so I could see all the entrances at a glance.



“It’s okay,” I told myself. “You’ll be okay. Everything will be okay.”



But that wasn’t the case.



The storm hit on the third night.



Of course. Because what would be a Gothic horror experience without a terrifying storm? It started as distant thunder and occasional flashes of lightning, then gradually escalated into a raging torrent, the wind howling and the rain pounding against the windows like bullets.



“It’s so cozy here,” John said, seemingly unharmed. We were trapped in a gloomy villa, surrounded by what felt like the end of the world. He was sprawled on the sofa, a book he’d found in the library about Victorian architecture, but he wasn’t even reading it.



“It’s so cozy,” I echoed, when a sudden, deafening clap of thunder startled me. “Yeah, it’s so cozy.”



Just then, I saw it. A flash of lightning illuminated something outside the window. A figure. Definitely a figure. Humanoid, standing in the garden, staring straight at the house.



He was staring straight at me.



“John!” I screamed, my hand trembling as I pointed to the window. “There! There’s someone outside!”



John only tilted his head slightly. “It might just be a twig or something.”



“That’s not a twig! It’s a person!” “I see them!”



Another flash of lightning. The figure was closer. It was definitely a person. It was definitely watching us.



“John, please,” I pleaded, hating my hoarse voice. “There’s someone outside. We have to call the police.”



“Call the police for what?” John finally showed some interest and asked. “No cell phone signal, you forgot? The landline has been down since we got here.”



“Then we have to do something! We need to—”



A knock at the door.



Knock, knock, knock.



We both froze. The knocking echoed in the house, sounding especially loud in the storm.



Knock, knock, knock.



“Don’t open the door,” John said, probably the first rational thing he’d said on this trip.



But I was already walking toward the door. Not because I wanted to—heaven knows I didn’t want to at all—but because some terrible mixture of politeness and curiosity was driving me. He walked forward like a puppet on strings.



“Louise, don’t—” John began.



I opened the door.



A figure stood on the porch, soaking wet, the porch light flickering dramatically at that moment. He was tall, very tall, and thin, his black hair plastered to his scalp, his eyes gleaming like a wild beast. He was dressed in all black, which did nothing to lessen the aura of a serial killer he exuded, and he… he made strange hand gestures.



Sign language. What was he gesturing?



And I recognized him.



“Didn’t I tell you not to follow me?” I said, my voice trembling, which John would have mistaken for fear, but it was more like anger.



The figure on the porch, Liam, gestured a few more times. Frenzied gestures. His hands moved rapidly, a gesture I had seen years ago: danger. Inside. Him. A trap.



“Alright, alright,” I said, raising my hands, “come in. You’re soaking wet.” “



I grabbed Liam’s arm and pulled him into the hallway, acutely aware that John was standing right behind me, staring at this soaking wet stranger I’d just dragged into our room. A secluded villa in the midst of a storm.



“My God, you’ve scared me to death these past two days!” I exclaimed, slamming the door shut to block the wind. My voice was loud and urgent, just as John expected. “I knew someone was out there! I knew I wasn’t being paranoid!”



Liam shivered, his dark clothes dripping onto Aunt May’s Persian rug. He looked like a drowned rat. A tall, intimidating little dog, clearly having been following me for two days.



“Louise,” John’s voice was tense. “Who is this?”



Okay. Introduce yourself. I can do introductions to eachother; I’m good at social etiquette, even in completely crazy situations.



“John, this is Liam,” I rubbed my hands together, my voice trembling with just the right amount of nervousness. “He’s an old friend of mine. A middle school classmate. We, well, used to know each other.” "He might...he might live nearby! Right, Liam?"



Liam started gesturing again, his hands flying across the page, but I couldn't look at him. Not now.



"He might live nearby," I repeated, my voice louder. "Small world, right? The odds are so low!"



John's expression shifted from confusion to anger. "He's been following you for two days? And you...you let him in?"



"He's fine!" I insisted, my voice rising. "He just...he might want to surprise me. You, Liam? Good heavens, you must be freezing!"



Liam's gestures became even more frantic now, and I pieced together what he was saying: recording. Evidence. John. Diana. Insurance money.



Oh, Liam. Always so thoughtful.



"I'm calling the police," John said, pulling out his phone.



"No!" I almost screamed, this time my voice filled with panic, "No, John, don't call the police. It's unnecessary." “Liam’s harmless. He’s just…he just cares about me. Aren’t you, Liam?”



Liam nodded obediently.



“This is insane,” John said, still holding his phone. “Louise, this guy has been following you. He followed us all the way to this remote place. He even stood outside in the storm watching us. And you expect me to…just…make him tea?”



“Yes!” I said desperately. “Tea’s great, I’ll make it, who doesn’t like tea!”



“You’re hopeless,” John said, his voice full of disgust. “You’re utterly hopeless. I can’t believe I’ve wasted six months on this.”



“You’re right,” I said softly, obediently lowering my eyes, just as he expected. “I’m sorry. I know I’m too difficult.” “I don’t want to live with a stalker,” John shook his head. He grabbed his coat from the hanger, and I felt a genuine wave of panic wash over me.



“I’ll wait for you in the car,” John announced. “Come find me when you’re sober. If you want to stay here with your stalker friend, that’s your choice. But I don’t want to stay any longer.”



The door behind him slammed shut with a bang, so hard it shook the windows. The sound echoed in the room, followed by silence, broken only by the sound of the downpour and the dripping of water from Liam’s clothes onto the carpet.



I stood there, staring at the closed door, stunned for a long time. Then, I slowly turned to face Liam.



“Okay,” I said, my voice lowering, returning to a certain range that felt truly comfortable—deeper, colder, completely unlike my previous soft soprano. “That was really dramatic.” Liam stared at me, his eyes filled with both worry and approval. His hands moved quickly and familiarly: Are you alright?



"I'm fine," I said, walking past him toward the living room. "But it would have been better if you hadn't been so conspicuous. Did you have to stay in the garden for two whole days? John noticed, you know? Even John noticed, and he's not exactly a perceptive person."



Liam followed behind me, gesturing as he went: We have to make sure you're safe. We have to keep an eye on him. We have to protect you.



"I can protect myself," I said. "Play me the recording." Liam smiled, reached into his pocket, pulled out a small recording device, and held it up like a trophy.



"Great," I said, taking the recorder and pressing play.



Diana's voice filled the room. I listened to their conversation with detachment, as if reviewing a business plan. In a way, it was a business plan. A very deadly one.



"Are you sure she'll agree?" diana asked. "She's not one to act on impulse."



"She will. I know how to handle her. A few compliments, a pitiful look, and she'll be obedient." The recording continued playing; John and Diana were discussing the insurance policy, the beneficiaries, and the most suitable secluded location for staging an "accident." I listened to John describe me as pathetic and exhausting, saying he couldn't wait to get rid of me.



"He's right, my complaining is exhausting," I thought. "I have to speak in that voice in front of him, it sounds like I'm breathing helium."



Liam started gesturing in sign language again: Are you angry?



"Angry?" I pondered the question as the recording ended. "No, maybe disappointed."



I walked to the window and looked at the car in the driveway. John was in the driver's seat, his phone flashing in the darkness. He was probably texting diana, telling her what was going on.



"How much do you know?" I asked Liam without turning my head. "I mean, about Daniel."



A long silence followed. Then I felt him gesturing: Enough.



Liam approached me, his hands moving slowly but firmly: "I know what you're thinking. Don't do this." "Let me handle him. You don't need to—"



That's Liam's problem. He's never as good as me at handling things. For example, if I were to follow someone, it would never be this obvious. Or… that's the real problem, right? That's why I posted that silly thread on Reddit. Because Liam was too hasty; he forgot that the last time I used the shovel he brought was great, very sturdy. But he took it with him when he left. Now I need another one, but I don't know where to find one in the middle of nowhere at night.



I patted his cheek and kissed his hair. "Thanks. But I can handle it."



So, does anyone have a shovel? I'll DM you the address. Don't worry too much, I'm just doing some gardening to calm Liam and me down. I'm really panicking right now. Also, we might need some acid to deal with the weeds, which would be great if you could bring some.
