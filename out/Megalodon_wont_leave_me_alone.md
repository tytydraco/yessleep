I never wanted to write this. But I have to warn someone, anyone, anyone at all. Maybe he will stop bothering me when enough people become aware of him. His name is Megalodon. 

I live in Arkansas, just west of Fayetteville close to Lake Wedington which most local people visit only during the daylight. They say it’s beautiful, peaceful, and untouched. I started fishing again last week during a peaceful evening alone. The pond near my house was a perfect mirror of stillness and silence with unexpected depth. The water absorbed your reflection completely.

That’s where I saw him first. 

Through the dim shine of his old diving helmet, he stared at me while his jeans and leather jacket were sopping. His clothes dripped water in the ankle-deep pond. He held a catfish with his bare hands and squeezed so hard I feared he would break its bones. The fish squirmed against his grip while its mouth moved without making a sound. He wasn’t fishing for fish. He was fishing for something else. 

That night, I got the first message. 

Unknown Number: “Good catch tonight. You hooked me.” 

I blocked it. Another spam text I thought. 

Next day, another: 

Unknown Number: “You left something behind.” 

Attached was a photo. The photo showed my fishing equipment I left behind at the pond’s edge where the mysterious figure had positioned himself. My blood went cold. 

Days passed, and the texts kept coming. Always vague. Always unnerving. Always at night. 

I attempted to ignore the texts until one left me so shaken that goosebumps took over my entire body.

Unknown Number: “Come outside. I’m fishing.” 

Heart pounding, I peeked through my curtains. Under the faint glow of the streetlight he stood at the pond’s edge while his diving helmet sparkled under the moonlight. His slow wave accompanied by a shiny hook in his hand signaled his presence.

I bolted the door and windows and called 911. The police responded to my call but discovered nothing. They laughed it off as a prank, one of them even questioned me about if I had done any drugs. They failed to notice him as he slowly disappeared into the darkness of the water.

The next day, I researched local history. Lake Wedington was part of a CCC project from the 1930s until its closure after excavation workers struck an underground source which brought seawater into the lake. Their search revealed floating dead objects which were bloated and distorted beyond recognition. Residents relocated due to fears about the mysteries that had emerged from the depths.

They called it Megalodon. Not the shark. Something older, deeper, hungrier. 

The helmeted entity concealed its true underlying form.

My phone buzzed later that night and fear settled deep in my stomach.

Unknown Number: “Open up. Let me in.” 

Silence. Then gentle knocking on my front door. Rhythmical, almost polite. 

Knock. Knock. Knock. 

I stared through the peephole. He remained completely still while his helmet hovered just inches from my front door. The sound of breath filled the air with wet, labored gasps that resembled the struggle of someone trying to breathe through waterlogged lungs.

Then, chillingly, my mom’s voice: 

“Sweetie, please open the door. I’m scared.” 

My mother was one of the very few covid victims who died back in 2020.

Slowly I stepped back as my mind demanded I flee and disappear. But where? 
Knock. Knock. Knock. 

My little sister’s trembling voice emerged from the darkness.

“Please… it’s dark out here.” 

My sister moved to Colorado years ago. 

He wasn’t mimicking them. He was wearing them. 

Knock. Knock. Knock. 

My voice this time, broken and pleading: 

“You can’t leave me out here alone. Please.” 

Shaking and crying I fell backward into the kitchen. I called 911. The person who spoke to me over the phone sounded exactly like him with his voice sounding wet and distorted.

“You hooked me. Now reel me in.” 

I’m trapped now. All doors locked. All lights off. Water infiltrates beneath the doorframe and devours my feet. Saltwater. The scent of decaying seaweed fills my lungs.

He doesn’t hunt. He fishes. 

And he’s fishing for me. 

I don’t know what happens next. When you encounter someone standing by calm water who is soaking wet and wearing a diving helmet that hides an ancient hungry presence, you must avoid getting close. Don’t stare. Don’t let him see you. 

Because once he hooks you… 

He never lets go.
