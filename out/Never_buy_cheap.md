I'm a single guy in my 30''s, and I recently broke down and bought a sex doll. 

Judge if you want, I don't care. 

Though lacking much of the fulfillment of a healthy relationship, I had determined that owning a doll was a hell of a lot cheaper than dating in the long run.

The thing is, they're expensive if you don't want some nightmarish cheap mannequin. Some are advanced, with lifelike skin and motion, and they'll run around 3 grand easily.

I make enough to get by, but I was definitely willing to go a little shady to get a deal. I found some weird Chinese site that sold dolls custom made at high qualities for about half what I found anywhere else, and after some research on Reddit got confirmation that this company actually delivered a good product.

She arrived a week ago. I didn't name her. It felt weird. She arrived naked and bald wrapped in plastic and it was a little eerie unwrapping a lifelike body I'll admit. Id heard the dolls were heavy- and she was. About as much as a real person. Once I got her wig on and dressed her in some of my exes clothes--you don't need to tell me-- 
She actually looked very nice.

But I couldn't shake the creepiness of it all. I'd avoided the type of doll a lot of guys buy, giant tits and ass, tiny waist. My doll had a beautifully toned and average shaped body, the face of the classic Girl Next Door. But when you're not having sex with a sex doll.... it's just kind of sitting there like a corpse.

When I finally went through with having sex with her, halfway through she exhaled. It freaked me out but then I figured, obviously some air gets shoved into these things and then gets out. But I couldn't keep trying.

She sat in my closet for 5 days. I had dreams where I'd walk into the closet and she was gone, and I'd feel a wave of relief wash over me. When I woke up, I'd remember she was there and feel dread.

Eventually I noticed the smell. Sickly sweet decay. If you've smelled it before it's unmistakable and it was without a doubt coming from the doll.

The dread in my gut climbed up my spine and stood my hair on end as I opened the closet door and looked at the doll slumped over. The smell wasn't overwhelming, but it got worse when I dragged the doll into my room. I already knew what I expected to find, but had to confirm it.

Using a sharp knife from my kitchen I carefully cut the dolls face around the edges, and braced for what I might see when I peeled it away.

Nothing. Hollow head. But that rotted smell was coming from the doll no question, so I moved lower and sliced the body from collar to groin.

As I did so the body slipped and spilled across my lap a mass of ragged wet rodent carcasses. A rat and a litter of young somehow trapped inside the doll and shipped overseas.

You can't ship these dolls back, and like hell I'd throw it out for the garbage man. So one night I crept out back and buried this whole nightmare like a murderer buries his victim.
