***


 

We flew to Germany. Tickets were expensive. 

— 

I met Becca’s family. They were wonderful. 

— 

After months of waiting, dozens of nights of watching 90’s shows, listening to new “best of” playlists and scrolling through my phone, the moment had finally come.  

It was our thirteenth night in Berlin, and I told Becca that I was going to a club famous for its EDM raves, (she knew I had an appreciation for German techno). Although Becca was not a huge fan herself, she told me to have fun, and that we would catch up later that same night. She would go to a bar with one of her cousins. 

In truth, of course, I was going to the *Friedrichstadt-Palast*. A large, pretty famous theater in central Berlin that could accommodate up to 1,800 spectators. The throngs outside curled for over two blocks, but people in line told me not to worry: “das ist normal.” 

Tickets weren’t cheap. The equivalent of a hundred Canadian or so. It was a near sold out screening because apparently—the film was supposed to be good.  

I was curious from a typical filmgoer’s perspective whether or not the movie would be to my taste at all. Was it even possible for me to like it? *Can I really enjoy something that has been responsible for so much trauma?* 

By some miracle, my seat was on the floor and not on a balcony. I sat in the west wing surrounded by an odd mix of audience. Half were the expected critics, cinephiles and Berliner upper crust all wearing their sophisticated evening attire, but the other half were … *strange*. It's like they’re expecting some kind of heavy metal concert. They were wearing all leather, latex and lots of clothespins. Several have pentagrams inscribed on their clothing. I recognized plenty of the expected band shirts. *Black Sabbath. Slayer. Behemoth.* 

A tanned, cheerful presenter went up and explained that he was very proud to present this “exquisite gem” of a film to Europe for the first time, and that the filmmaker was in the audience with us tonight. There would be a Q & A after the screening. 

I took a quick scan of the crowds to see if I could recognize somebody, but the audience was too massive. A flesh colored soup in every direction. 

Soon the lights went down, the projector turned on, and several sponsors were briefly flashed on screen. Armani. Uber. Mastercard. Something called ZDF, Potsdamer Platz and RBB Media.  

Then the movie started. 

— 

The opening scene is loud. It’s a festive night outdoors with lots of candles, lanterns, instruments and plenty of characters eating meat off skewers. It had to be set in the early 1900s, 1800s, or maybe 1700s? *(*I don’t know my medieval times)*.* We’re introduced to a bride on the eve of her own wedding. I realize she looks identical to Polina.  

A skewer goes through my stomach.  

I’m mentally bombarded with images from that set three years ago. I see Polina getting wet from our march in the woods, I see her moaning under the twisted oak tree. Then I see her looking mangled and despondent after repurposing Kon’s dead body. 

*This actress on screen is Polina. No one realizes we are watching a ghost with a stolen body on screen. A wraith in cold flesh.* 

I exhale the thought. Squeeze my eyes shut.  

*It’s just a movie. Just pretend it’s a movie. That’s all you're here to see.* 

After a few moments I pry my eyes open, and do my best to forget. I try to get carried away by the movie’s plot. And to my surprise, I do. 

Very quickly we learn that Polina is to be betrothed to a sharp, brutal man. It's someone she clearly does not want to marry. In the last hour of freedom (before she is expected at the altar), the camera follows Polina as she wanders away from the party towards a small pond, seeking solace in the night.  

In subtitles we see Polina speak to herself. Pity herself. She looks into her reflection in the pond and says, “I would rather marry a pig than that awful oaf.” The water warbles a bit, buffeted by wind. 

As luck would have it. Her husband-to-be chokes at the dinner banquet—on one of the meat skewers. There’s a scene where multiple people attempt a primitive Heimlich maneuver to no avail. The groom’s family ends up in tears, and the priest calls the wedding off. But despite everything, Polina’s folks still get to keep her wedding gifts as compensation. Including a large black swine.  

The wedding guests leave despondent or drunk, or some mix of both, while Polina on the other hand, is secretly euphoric. It's the closest I had ever seen her to revealing a smile. 

That night she visits the swine by herself at the pigsty. She is so relieved that she goes to thank the animal. Much to her surprise, it begins to talk. 

“I’m your new husband.” 

Polina is of course scared. Confused. “You’re my new husband?”  

“Yes. Your wish has been granted, and you must treat me like your husband. If you betray this gift, your soul is forfeit.” 

Polina’s pupils widen, she covers her mouth. Through narration we learn that animals could only speak back then if they had been imbued with the Devil’s magic. Although terrified, Polina reluctantly agrees to visit and feed the pig each night. 

Through title cards, we learn a week has passed. Polina appears just in time to calm down a raucous swine. The pig is aggressively headbutting the fence of the pigsty 

“Why are you treating me like an animal? Am I not your husband? Should I not be wearing your husband's clothes?” 

Polina has no rebuttal for this. And so the following night, we watch her walk up to her town’s small cemetery and dig up her fiancee's grave. The burial soil was not very deep (because the region is mountainous), it is dug up in a quick montage. Her betrothed had been buried in the finest suit he owned, and in between worried stares, Polina removes it piece by piece. 

In the morning, Polina’s youngest brother wakes up the family with laughter. “The pig has found a suit! The pig has found a suit!” 

It’s a laugh riot. The family assumes that someone in the village is playing a very funny joke. Maybe the neighbor’s teenage son? Everyone is surprisingly accepting of the pig’s new clothes, and no one draws the connection to Polina’s dead husband-to-be. 

Polina pretends to find it amusing too, and says she would like her gift-pig to remain this way. Everyone is instructed not to undress the pig. And so no one does. The clothes are too filthy to touch anyway. 

On Polina’s next nightly visit, the swine has a new demand.  

“So you’ve dressed me like your husband. That much is true.  But how come I must eat my dinner out here, out of a trough? While the rest of your family eats inside?” 

Polina has no rebuttal for this. So the following night, she invites the pig inside. “He gets along well with the children,” Polina explains. 

Although the children are not overly ecstatic, they do indeed play with the pig, offering it some of their dinner. With a certain measure of reluctance, the family accepts this novelty, at least for the night. 

But the following morning, the swine *still* demands more.  

“How come after dinner, I am led back into this pen, and not to a bed? How come I am not permitted to share a bed with my wife?” 

Polina has no rebuttal for this. And so, after sneaking the pig more of their dinner the next evening, she waits until everyone else goes to the communal bedroom, and then she leads the pig into her own bed in the living room. 

She leads the pig first onto the straw bed. He practically occupies the whole thing.  

“Now lay with me.” The swine says.  

Teeth clenched and shoulders raised, Polina slides onto the small patch of sheet that’s still accessible. Her ankles are seen colliding with the pig’s hooves. She shifts to lay as distantly as possible, but the pig squirms closer. 

“Wrap an arm around me.” 

Polina begins attempting this, and abruptly stops. She is simply too disgusted to continue. She rolls off the bed. 

“A wife must lay with her husband,” The pig says. 

“I can’t. I’m sorry. I just can’t.” 

“You will. Or your soul is mine.” 

Without much choice, she lays back down, facing the pig. With all the willpower she can muster, Polina raises an arm and wraps it around the pig’s head, as if she were coddling a child. Or a lover.  

“Now kiss me.” 

The pig opens his large gaping maw. A glistening, pink tongue flaps out, searching for interaction. There is still some rotting food in the back of the pig’s molars.  

At this point, I pull my head back and look around the audience, swapping petrified expressions with the middle aged Berliners seated around me. No amount of special effects in the world can fake what is being shown on-screen right now.  

It is indisputably a live-action animal pig with a live-action actress.  

They are about to kiss.  

Are they actually going to?  

They do.  

I hear reflexive gagging, and mutters from the audience. 

*“Mein Gott … ”* 

*“Widerlich.”* 

*“It must be fake … ”* 

But it’s not. I can only muster about two seconds of willpower to watch this pig lick a human’s mouth like an over-excited dog. 

Polina screams and brushes the pig aside. It squeals loudly, rolling in the bed. 

“Kiss me! KISS ME!” 

When I look back at the screen, Polina’s father emerges from the bedroom, eyes wide with shock. “The Devil has my daughter!”  

The pig shrieks around on the bed, flopping and flailing like any real life animal would. 

We see the father grab an ax, lift it, and then the film cuts to black.  

Fade in: it's the next day. The pig lies headless on a large wooden plank, while Polina’s mother cooks its haunches over a fire. There is yelling and stomping, the camera pans over to the father who points and spits at his daughter.  Polina is curled in a corner, sobbing. 

She is banished to the forest. If she is ever caught close to the house again, her father will have no choice but to kill her. He will not risk spreading her evil to the rest of the family. 

With nothing but her gray dress and a small sack of food, Polina treads away and into the dark, foreboding woods, forbidden from even looking back at her home. 

The camera glides behind her as she stumbles through the branches. Polina moves awkwardly across deepening areas of peat and mud, before she realizes what’s underfoot, she trips into a bog. Polina sinks down to her waist, struggling tragically and inefficiently. She sinks down to her neck, and calls for help as loud as she can. Within a matter of seconds … she chokes. We see bubbles. Fingertips. Polina drowns. Another cut to black. 

When we return, Polina wakes up beside a large oak tree. The very same tree I climbed in four years ago. I feel goosebumps like I’ve never felt before. I am frozen in my seat. 

“Am I alive?” The subtitles hold on the screen. The actress has now changed, she is gaunter, paler. She looks like Polina did on the day I first met her. She turns to the camera, and asks the audience the same question. “*Czy ja żyję? Czy ja żyję?”* 

“Am I alive?” 

“No you are not.” The pig’s voice returns. “You have broken your promise. You have killed me like a common swine.”   
   
Polina takes a step back and circles around the tree in reverse, searching for the source of the voice. “I didn’t mean to!” She yells. 

“Your soul is forfeit. It is mine.” 

Polina takes her hands in her head. “I didn’t mean to! I didn’t mean to!”  Something invisible pushes her over, attacks her. She tries to shove it away but it's too strong. 

There’s squealing. Screaming. 

*This is the sound I recorded. This is what we shot beneath that tree*. *What happened was real.*  

“And because you have cooked and eaten me, I shall rebuke the same.” 

Something invisible takes a bite of Polina’s shoulder, she wails and falls to the ground. 

Then the film abruptly cuts to action shots of her escaping. She is terrified. Running wounded through the forest. The camera is jumpy and chaotic. I soon recognize this segment as the POV shots that Olek took as he ran through the woods on his own. A fern branch brushes past the lens. 

I feel a panic attack coming on. I can’t be here. I can’t be in this theater. I get up, and attempt to squeeze by the patrons, but I can’t get past. The film is too loud and the other patrons are literally too glued to the screen to even notice me. 

I plonk back down and recognize the cabin. The old lodge cabin we had visited that day. It’s wooden, mossy and dilapidated. With clever angles, it looks like it could be medieval, made in some rural woods, but I know it's modern. This one anachronistic detail is what allows me to breathe. 

*It is still just a movie. Just a recreation. A farce. This is fake. It's all fake.* 

But then comes Konrad on screen. O*r at least what I know to be the reconfigured body of Konrad.* I recognize the shoulders and cheekbones a little, but the rest is all Polina. The audience won't be able to tell. 

This Polina walks out to a fire, searching for warmth. And out from the fire … emerges a ten foot demon.  

The thing from hell. 

Everyone in the theater reels back. Gasps erupt. 

The thing that had seared its way into my memory that fateful day. It was what Olek had been trying to capture on screen the whole time. 

“I’m not interested in capturing some ghost, or possession.” Olek had told me when he forced me into that circle of cult-members. “No no. I want to catch the uncatchable. The impossible.” 

I held the boom unwavering and pointed it at Polina. I could hear the fierce snarls coming out of the fire. Polina shrieked as the small flame erupted into a conflagration, opening some awful portal that never should have been opened. Olek had invited the unthinkable into our plane. 

Even now, simply staring at a projection on screen, I am as captivated as I was back then. 

It was a cross between a baboon and a boar, except it had *flaming tusks*, and *mouths for eyes*. The beast cried out and gored Polina, killing and roasting her.  

*And because you have cooked and eaten me, I shall rebuke the same.* 

The sound of her smoldering screech is the last thing I remembered recording. 

Now here it was again. An unholy image. Dark magic. *Actual footage of a devil on screen*. It is horrifying, terrifying, but at the same time … mesmerizing. This one shot of the demon feasting upon Polina is traumatic and real. The audience can inherently feel that something genuine is happening. There is something on screen that is more than just an image. It is impossible to look away. 

My heart jumps through my neck, I can feel it in my eyes. This moment on film is the precise cause of all misery in my life. I can’t unsee it. I can’t unhear it.  

It is proof that evil is real. That there is something worse than the worst thing you could possibly imagine. 

The screen becomes too bright. I feel faint. 

— 

When I come to, there is riotous applause. The lights in the theater have been turned on, and everyone is now on their feet, giving a standing ovation. 

I am confused. Not just because I missed whatever portion of the movie came next, but also genuinely mystified. A full theater standing up, and giving unanimous applause? 

I wait to see if it is out of politeness, surely after a minute they will stop. But they do not. The clapping only grows stronger. 

I look around and could feel the beguilement. They are enthralled. Hypnotized by what they just saw.  

The applause goes on for over fifteen minutes. Eventually the presenter goes back on stage, *still* continuing to clap, uninterrupting the applause for another ten minutes. 

The director appears and holds his hands up high over his head. He closes his eyes. It goes on like this for *another* five minutes, until finally, after one last set of cheers and whistles, the pandemonium settles down. 

“Thank you,”  Olek says. 

—   
   
Catharsis is not what I felt. This was not the closure I was after. I felt like I had bared witness to something only I knew the true meaning behind, and I didn’t know what to do. 

On stage, Olek still wore his signature black trench coat, except this one was hemmed and stylized in a high fashion sort of way. He answered benign questions from the presenter about the location, script and budget, but nothing that cut into the heart of what everyone just saw. 

And then when the floor was opened up to audience questions. Everyone continued to shower praise. 

“Who did your cinematography? It was beautiful.” 

“Where did you find your actors? Unbelievable.” 

“How did you pull off those VFX? How?” 

Something inside me became livid. I looked around to see if there was anyone as put off as I was. *Does no one else know what Olek truly is?* 

*Does no one else know what happened behind the scenes?* 

I was beside myself. I lifted my hand to ask the next question. But there was a sea of hands, would they even pick me? 

*Fuck it.* If no one is going to say it, then I would. Olek was in the middle of responding to some meager question when I stood up and yelled. 

“Murderer! MURDERER! The man on stage is a murderer!” 

Patrons within earshot turned to me, the room fell quiet. Even Olek appeared taken aback. 

I began to rattle off the names of the Polish teens who went missing, reading from a list I kept in my pocket. “Adrian Kowalski! Paweł Nowak! Martyna Wiśniewska! …” I was probably butchering the pronounciation, but I yelled them anyway. 

A security guard started to walk down the aisle, approaching my row. Olek is also approached by some other organizers on stage. He shook his head and grabbed the mic. 

“Please do not arrest her! Please do not! This is actually all good to hear.” 

I finished hollering the names. Questioning voices swirled around me. 

“She is thinking of a tragic event that happened in the Polish film community,” Olek added a fair bit of grief to his voice and took a pause. “A man named Łukasz Dębrowski shot an infamous video in Poland where seven students went missing.” He lifted his hand, “I … was one of those students” 

Sharp inhales travelled through the crowd. Several *wow*’s. 

“Yes. It was a traumatic experience, but it was also, for me, revelatory. It was one of the chief inspirations behind this film actually. It is important to remember those who have suffered, so in the future we need not suffer again.” 

Audience-members turned to me, looking for my response. But what was I supposed to say? Was Olek lying? Was the real Łukasz actually found and arrested? 

Before I could assemble a reply, someone else asked a question, and very quickly I was forgotten. Just another fly on a wall. 

Just another attention seeker. 

— 

Once the doors opened, I squeezed out of my seat and ran outside. I wanted to get as far away from the Polish warlock, as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, with close to two thousand seats vacating—I was trudging through molasses. 

To make things worse, as I snailed out the exit funnel, I just so happened to bump into Becca, who was pleasantly surprised to see me. I had no idea she was even at the screening. 

I did not want to pause, or mill about in the slightest, but I couldn’t just blow off my partner. 

“Anna! Oh my god! I didn’t know you were coming to see *Krew*! I would have saved you a seat!” 

I gave a half-assed excuse about my rave being cancelled, and then finding something else to do. Becca seemed to accept this and then introduced me to some filmie friends she had made recently at a bar. I shook their hands between a river of people. 

“We should get a couple drinks!” Becca pointed to the bar across from the coat check. “Everyone’s too busy going to the bathroom. This is the perfect time! Come on!” 

I really didn’t want to linger here. I really just wanted to go. But I calmed myself by picturing Olek exiting out the back. *Chances are he was leaving like everyone else. I could distance myself by staying.* 

So despite my reservations, we sat at the bar. I wore my toque and zipped up my jacket. I didn’t want to be recognized as ‘*that person at the Q&A*’, but as soon as we started talking, I realized that was the last thing on anyone’s mind. 

“Could you feel it in the room?”  

“You mean, the energy? The magic?”  

“I have never watched *anything* that has made me feel the way that movie does!” Becca held both hands on her head, a smile from ear to ear. “That was insane!” 

I nodded and tried to fake a grin. It was easier to pretend I was on the same page, but on the inside, I was dying. 

“And that’s the guy?” One of Becca’s new friends asked. 

“That’s the guy!” Becca slapped my thigh, stinging it a little. “Anna, you’ll never believe this, but I’ve got some amazing news. You’ll never believe it!” 

I knew that Becca had been trying to line up work for spring through a few of her contacts, and she didn’t want to tell me because she didn’t want to jinx it. She had been pining hard for B unit camera op on *Yellowjackets …* 

“Im shooting his next one. I’m officially his next DP!” 

“That’s fucking awesome!” The other filmies said, clinking their drinks.  

The information passed through me. It didn’t register. 

“Isn’t that great Anna?” Becca hovered her martini close to mine. 

“Isn't what great?” 

“I’m shooting Olek’s next movie. My first art house, I’ve caught my big break!” 

I stared at her and tried to cobble together some kind of smile, I tried to cobble together any kind of response at all. I couldn't.  “No, you’re not. That’s … what?” 

“I know! Crazy right!” She bumped my glass and took a big swig. 

I crumpled on the inside. *No. Please. This can’t be happening.* I mumbled out some paltry congratulations without actually thinking about it. She kissed me on the cheek. Then I whispered to her ear, “You can’t do it. You can never do it. Please don’t.” 

“What did you say?”  She indicated ‘another round’ to the bartender. 

I didn’t have the energy to explain. I needed to get out. I needed to get away from here. Olek could show up without me knowing. He could find me. 

“I’m sorry. I’ll … I’ll meet you at the hotel.” 

“Anna, are you alright?” 

I shrugged and stood up. Then I left completely unceremoniously as our second set of drinks arrived. The filmies swapped confused glances, Becca stood up, but didn’t follow. 

“I’ll see you at the hotel?” She called behind my back. I didn’t reply.  

— 

I was a complete mess on the uber ride back. *This is a dream, this can’t be happening. There’s no way any of this is real.* 

I bolted to our hotel room in a flurry and ran to the sink. I set the water to hot and splashed it onto my face. I set the water to cold and did the same. I alternated like this, over and over. 

I wiped my eyes and sat down on the bed, questioning my sanity. I took deep long breaths, emptying my lungs completely before filling them back up. I did this for about five minutes, until I could feel my heart slow down. 

I closed my eyes. *You’re gonna be okay. You’re safe here. You’re gonna be okay.* 

Then a light breeze tickled across my neck. Which was odd because I did not remember leaving the window open. *Did I turn on the AC?* 

When I looked up, he was there. Leaning against the coat rack.  

Olek was in my room. 

“What a coincidence,” he said. 

I stayed seated on my bed. Said nothing. Enough impossible things had already happened on this night that I refused to even believe he was here. 

And yet he was. Leaning on the coat rack. 

“Berlin huh?” 

I tried to look away, but found it difficult, his gray eyes were locked onto mine now. There wasn’t any sense of menace, or immediate danger.  Just a sort of nonchalant observation.  Like how a wolf might study a lost fawn. 

“Did you enjoy the movie?” 

I briefly considered jumping. Running.  Doing anything to get out of this situation, but he was blocking the door. I was dealing with someone who could literally apparate. What could I do? What could I *even attempt* to do? 

“You know I had a lot of trouble changing my identity. It was a lot of effort to fix that.” He took a step towards me, and lifted a single finger, pointing it. “Do you want me to fix it again?”  

Ice cold dread coursed through my entire body. It felt like I was in that cabin again, shivering in a thin, damp dress. With a lot of effort, I found the ability to speak, and sputtered out what I could. “N-n-no. No. I won't tell anyone. I'll never speak of it again.” 

He walked over to the window, closed it, and put his hands in his pockets. “You were the first one I’ve let go. My experiment with mercy, you know?” 

Outside was dark, the rain had started to trickle. I could see a few streams sliding down on the window, streaking Olek’s reflection. “Do you like mercy?” 

I cleared my throat. Nodded. 

“Good. I think your friend will too. I look forward to working with her” He lowered the blinds on the window. Drew the curtains. 

“Speaking of mercy. I let Polina go, did you know that?” 

My eyes were glued to his own again. I couldn’t look away. My bed had turned into the soiled, rotted cot that I had clung to in that cabin. 

“I couldn't keep bringing her back. She was truly depleted. After that last shot … she’s forever gone.” 

His dress shoes squeaked one after the other. His black coat tailed behind. In a moment's time Olek had sat beside me on the bed. 

*Don’t move. Remain steady. Don’t show fear.* 

“It is very hard to find a new wraith. It needs to be someone who has suffered for a very long time. Someone who is always suffering.” 

He put a hand on my shoulder. Patted it once. Twice. 

I pictured gunning for the door. I pictured struggling to fend him off. I pictured doing nothing at all. 

“You're within reach.” Is all he eventually said.  

Then he sighed and stood up, walking calmly back to the door.  I had a burst of adrenaline. I was ready to jump forward. To leap on his back. To run screaming towards the window.  

But Olek wasn’t even paying attention to me. Instead, he glanced at his phone, and scrolled through some text. Tapped a couple things. After putting it away, he seemed to remember I was still in the room. “There’s a party happening. An underground club. You’re welcome to join if you want.” 

I was far beyond a place of shock, and yet somehow this still shocked me. *Is He actually inviting me to a club? What in the actual fuck?* 

He seemed to be able to read my face. 

“Suit yourself.” 

He turned around the corner out of sight. I could hear the door handle unlock, followed by the latch I put on.  With an old creak, the door swung, and in about a dozen footsteps, the czarownik’s presence vanished down the hall. 

I ran over and shut everything—applied all locks.  

Then I went back and sat down on the bed. *Do I call Becca? Do I call the police? Do I call the hotel? … Do I … Did that … actually just happen?* 

*Am I dreaming?* 

I grit my teeth and eyes, feeling the muscles of my face contract.  

Behind my scrunching eyelids I erase everything. This reality. This moment in time. This present universe. Everything’s wiped. This can’t be happening. 

After a few minutes I find myself lying on the bed. Unaware if I laid down myself.  

*I must have just woken up. That’s all.* 

I’m not entirely convinced, but I pretend that I am. 

I pretended it was all a dream. 

Pretending is what I’m good at. 

Pretending is all I’ve got.

The film shoot in Toronto would go for over a month. Becca said she would send me pictures everyday, of any fun stuff that was happening on set. 

I told her she could send me pictures—but nothing of the crew, nothing of the cast, and no equipment, cameras, or anything else. Nothing.  

She agreed, and very few pictures were sent. 

At work I asked if I could be removed from the Bridge Studios circuit, I didn't want to deliver mail to that district anymore. So my boss transitioned my route to downtown. It was a lot busier, (with a lot less parking) and I couldn't listen to my music as much, but that's okay. At least I was keeping my mind somewhat clear. 

Sometimes I would see a news van with a reporter standing outside, and other times I would see twenty-somethings making a student film. Depending on the day, I’d be able to look past it and breeze by, but not always. Sometimes I would get reminded of my boom pole, my headphones, and then get plunged back in. 

I would get flashes of the horns, the mouths, the *flaming tusks.* I would see that *thing from hell* again. Then I would pull over and spend several hours easing my way out of multiple panic attacks. 

It just was what it was. 

I pretended it was normal. 

I knew that I needed a true distraction. A paradigm shift. Something that could reset my brain away from my fear, unease and vulnerability. 

So halfway through Becca’s shoot, I had finally bit the bullet on my credit cards, and signed up. I enrolled at the Digital Music Academy. 

— 

On the first day, we were each assigned a MIDI keyboard. They looked expensive and brand new. Each MIDI came semi-weighted with a built-in pad controller, and my hands flickered across the keys with ease. It was a very nice feeling. 

There were two teachers overseeing twelve students. Both instructors were going to train us exclusively in person for three days a week, over three months. I was allowing myself to get excited. 

I couldn't remember the last time I felt excited. 

We introduced ourselves, everyone got a minute to explain their favorite genre of music. I said mine was trance-house with pop vocals. Someone recognized one of the more obscure artists I dropped. It felt good. 

The older instructor walked around, explaining how we would be using Ableton Live. There was an in-software tutorial that he recommended following alongside his directions, and that today we would be composing a melody with a simple 4/4 beat. The goal was to get familiar with the program. 

The younger instructor followed silently, handing out headphones for each of our stations.  

That’s when my heart sank. 

I tried to ignore the brand, but I couldn’t. 

They were Sennheisers. The exact same headphones I had used every day on set. My hands shook. My throat ached. Using all the willpower at my disposal I forced them onto my head. *It’s just plastic. It can’t hurt me.* 

*There is no way I can give up on this class.* 

“Everything alright?” The younger instructor asked. 

I nodded quickly. “Yeah yeah, just trying them on.” 

“Good. Try opening our test file.” 

Our computers were all given the same demo song to manipulate, it would help us understand how track layers and automations worked. I gave mine a play and recognized it as some 2010’s dance hit. 

As a class we analyzed the placement of the drums, treble and bass layers, but I was trying hard to discern what the background vocals were. A choir of children? Seagull calls?   
   
I scanned through the tracks in the software and couldn’t find them.  As I delicately pressed the foam cups to my ears, I realized the high pitched sounds were not of kids singing or of birds calling. 

It was squealing.  

At first it started soft, barely distinguishable from my thoughts, but soon it grew, both in volume and duration. I pulled out the headphone jack. The playback didn’t stop.  

The instructor came by and asked if I was okay again. Apparently I was crying. 

The squeals turned into screeches, the screeches turned to wails, the wails deepened into thunderous, demonic howls.  And somehow overtop of it all came chanting. Dark, harmonic chanting.*“ Anna. Annna. Annnnnnn—”* 

I dropped the headphones onto my neck. and wiped away my tears. 

“Yup. I'm fine. Everything's fine. I’m just—I can handle it.”   
   
“You sure?” 

I wasn’t, but what did that matter at this point? How could I even begin to scratch the surface of what I was trying to overcome? I had to find joy in something. I had to move on. I would force myself to find joy in this. I pretended to smile. 

“I’ll be fine,” I said. “Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.” 

The teacher looked into my eyes to try to understand what I was going through, but there’s no way she would. It must’ve been like that moment when I looked at Polina. At her sad, defeated eyes, bearing the weight of something that was impossible to explain. 

I was the same as her now. I was just like Polina.  

I held my face and started to sob. I couldn’t stop.
