Not sure if this is allowed here but, have you heard of u/SpecialNeedsDevil. Although it's been on Reddit for a while, I just found this story and it was truly one of the worst things I've read in a long time. If you don't know who this is, here's a video I've made now.

This was a mother, with a heart seemingly colder than ice, who came to the  r/confession subreddit to air out her dirty laundry. What she would write sends shivers down your spine. This mother, if we can call her that, came forward to explain how she was about to dump her own son into a residential facility. So she can conveniently erase him from her life, like an unwanted chapter she wishes to forget. In fact, she declares her child as nothing more than an inconvenient blip in her life. No remorse, no regret.

>"I don't love him. He doesn't have any personality, there is nothing to love. And yet I'm responsible for him. In addition to his extreme delays he's also medically fragile. Respiratory crises, fecal impactions (his autonomic nervous system doesn't function properly), issues with his G tube, infections, pressure sores no matter WHAT we put him on or how we position him.  
Our older son has suffered because his non existent brother has colored everything in his life. He's had medical care get delayed because there's only one of me and hos brother is more critical. We do have a visiting home nurse but only 20 hrs/week and we aren't eligible for more. I was starting law school, I gave up my dreams and my plan for my children for this potato. My older son can't do a lot of things he wants to do because of the youngers need for care and appointments.  
The final straw was I heard a sound. I went into Younger Son's room to check, thinking he had forgotten how to breathe again, and saw Older Son hitting him and screaming "You're why I don't have a mother! You're why I don't have a father! You're why I can't have friends over! You're why I can't be in sports! I didn't ask for you and I hope you die!"  
Instead of being horrified, I watched. And Younger Son just did. not. react. No signs of pain or fear or upset. No reaction at all.  
Reading this part kills me. She simply watched as her son beat up a helpless seven year old. That kills me inside, and perhaps she doesn’t even deserve this child."

  
While she did receive a lot of support in the comments. My only thought is, thank the lord that she doesn’t have that child with her anymore. It’d later come out that her boy had 3p deletion syndrome,  a rare autosomal and contiguous genomic disorder characterized by the following: intellectual disability; motor developmental delay; unusual facial features.  
It’s a serious case, and difficult thing to deal with, but to call your child a cucumber is next level evil. I don’t sympothise for the mother, I sympothise for the child, and I can only hope he’s in better hands, and that he’s seeing some real love for the first time.
