She left no Footprints in the Snow


"Come on, just one more drink? You know I'm good for it."


The bartender looked at me evenly, his dark eyes slitted as he tried to hide his frustration, "I know no such thing. You've still got money on your books from the week before last, and you dare to come in here flaunting your wealth? I was a fool to let you drink before you had settled your tab. Now get out."


The other drunks at the bar laughed, egging the bartender on as he crossed his arms. 


I wanted to argue, but the man was quite a bit larger than me, and I realized the futility of continuing. 


He would win, just as everyone did when they went up against me, so I hung my head and mumbled something about leaving.


As I stepped into the cold winter air, I felt some of my buzz deteriorate, the derision of my drinking companions following me out into the chill weather.


I was too drunk to be walking home, but it was my only means of convenience. 


I lived in Osaka at the time, back in the early two thousands. I was not what you would call a solid citizen. I believe the word most of my culture uses for people like me is NEET. It basically means I wasn't enrolled in school, I wasn't working on a family, and I wasn't in a job. I had never been a very diligent worker or a very good student. The jobs I'd had were menial and often didn't last longer than a month or two. My grades had been good enough to get me into several very expensive cram schools, but not into college. With no real prospects, I had settled into my life as a nobody. My parents paid for a cheap one-bedroom apartment in a part of town where you had to step over the winos as you stumbled home. They sent me money to avoid having me come to the house and bring shame on them. I didn't care, all my money went to booze or even less lofty pursuits, and I was essentially circling the drain.


I suppose fate had another plan because that was when I met a very special woman on my way home.


I had been celebrating a small victory that night, but it seemed that my luck had run out. I had a little extra money after my raffle ticket had brought a small windfall, and I had been buying drinks for a few of the barflies in an effort to get some female companionship that evening. They had taken my drinks and laughed at my jokes, but when the money was gone, so were they. I had drunk up all my extra money, and after having no luck mooching drinks from the usual bar patrons, I was forced to head home.


It was early December, and the snow on the ground was only an inch or two. The black ice glistened treacherously from the damp pavement, and I was trying my best not to weave too much as the bracing air took some of my buzz with it. The streets were mostly deserted, a few late-night pedestrians here and there, and the lights were far from seasonal. We don't really celebrate Christmas in Japan, not like Americans do, and the lights here were usually from the billboards or the advertisements that lit the night as well as the street lamps. 


I had turned a corner, heading from the trendy part of town I had been drinking in and into the less savory area where I lived, when I first saw her. I stopped for a moment, not quite believing what I was seeing. It was a youngish woman, her long black hair blowing in the winter wind and her bare feet walking delicately atop the snow. She was dressed in some kind of robe, a wrapper too light for the weather, and I followed behind her as I tried to find the courage to speak to her.


If she was out here in so little on a night like this, then she had to be as drunk as I was. Either that or on some kind of drug, but neither of that mattered much to me. There was heat in my apartment and a little more beer in the fridge. We could get warm together, maybe have a little drink, and watch the sun come up over the edge of my balcony. In her current state, I had little doubt that she would be glad for a warm place to stay, and as I quickened my pace to come even with her, I tried to find my best opening gambit.


"Good evening, what's a beautiful flower like you doing in the snow?"


Now that we were even with each other, I could see her better. Her skin was as perfect as a china doll, her complexion smooth as porcelain and her color as pale as milk. Her eyes were small and dark, focused ahead as she made her way towards wherever she was going, and it almost seemed she was ignoring me. That was nothing new, women often pretended they couldn't see me, but it was the little glances that kept me invested. 


She kept glancing at me with these coquettish glances, favoring me with these intriguing lifts of her thin lips, and they kept me interested.


"Aren't you cold? I know somewhere you can come to warm up. Your feet must be freezing."


We were about five or six blocks from my apartment, and since she seemed to be heading in that direction anyway, I thought my luck might be turning around.    


The two of us kept walking, me chatting away as she glided across the icy sidewalk. She seemed immune to the black ice that sometimes tripped me up, and I began to notice how smoothly she moved. I know that sounds a little strange, but she moved as if her feet never touched the ground. It was like watching someone operate an extremely lifelike puppet, but it only seemed odd through the lens of my memories.


At the time, I was just a drunk and slightly amorous male who was hoping to trick this clearly intoxicated woman back to my apartment.


I'm not the hero of this story, that should be obvious.


"What's your name?" I asked, realizing I didn't even know what her name was, but all I got in return was that same sly side-eye. Her face was utterly emotionless until she glanced at me and smirked. She seemed to know how to keep my interest, and I had become less flustered by the wind the longer we walked. I felt myself slowing to match her pace, my wet socks and cold feet no longer bothering me, and as we turned onto a familiar street I realized we were about two blocks from my apartment. I could even see my window from here, the buttery yellow light spilling out onto the street through the dirty window of the sliding door, and I smiled as I thought about how the sun would look as it came in through that pallid portal. 


When she turned suddenly, I almost missed it.


We were nearly there, the front gate to my apartment complex less than twenty steps up the road, and she had suddenly glided into the space between two buildings. The alley was a known haunt for winos and bums, and I found myself standing at the entrance as I watched her stroll into the semi-darkness. She had captured me effortlessly, and when she spun preternaturally in the low light and crooked a finger at me, I was taking that first step before I could stop myself. 


Luckily for me, the black ice got me before she did.


I slipped, falling onto my butt, and as the cold rushed over me, I sobered a bit.


That was how I noticed that, despite the snow in the alley being deep enough to cover the first three inches of the garbage cans and dumpster, she hadn't left a single footprint in the snow. 


I looked back and saw that the only footprints back the way we had come were mine, and that was when something hung in my booze-soaked broan.


"Beware of the Yuki Onna, my son," my mother had told me when I was very young, "Be careful that she doesn't get you while you're out in the snow."


I had stopped on my way out the door, my sled under my arm and my boots unmarked by moisture as of yet, and asked her what that was.


"Yuki Onna sometimes hunt for handsome men and try to take their life force. It stalks them through the snow, luring them away so it can get them alone, and freezes them in place as it draws out their precious life energy. So if a beautiful woman tries to take you away, come home quick and tell me so I can scare her off."


She had said it jokingly, but as I sat in the snow, I realized I was about to do exactly what she had warned me against.


The porcelain woman, a woman I now noticed left no trace behind, crooked a finger at me again, but I was up and running before it could waggle more than once.


Fortune was with me, and I didn't find another puddle of ice until I reached the stoop of my apartment. I could hear her behind me, her scream the roar of a winter wind, and as I rounded the gate and came into the courtyard, I expected to be pounced on at any minute. It would serve me right, I realized as I came shakily up the steps to the front door. I had thought I was the hunter, seeking my prey to lure it home, but I had been tricked and ran afoul of a much larger predator. I stumbled on the ice near the door, fumbling my key from my pocket, and as I looked up, I saw her reflected in the glass.


Her hair was no longer straight, writhing behind her as it rose like a nest of vipers. The wrapper now looked more like a funeral shroud, the edges tattered and dark with grave soil. Her dark eyes were now large and round, their centers full of terrible knowledge, and her jaw was opening much too wide as I slammed the key in the lock and rushed inside.


I shoved the door closed behind me, expecting a loud bang as she barreled through it, but when I turned to look from the stairs, the courtyard was empty save for the snowdrifts.


I drank the beer in my fridge alone that night, realizing how close I had come to death, and deciding it was time to make some changes.


I called my mother the next day and told her I needed help.


That was twenty years ago, and my nights of midnight carousing are behind me. I went to cram school, got my test scores up, started college, and now I work as an Engineer. My wife and I met in college, and we got married after she finished her doctorate. We have an apartment in a much better part of town, a son getting ready for highschool, and my current life is as far from that apartment where I saw the snow woman in as night from day. I no longer depend on my parents, and I've left the rut I had wallowed in for so long behind me.


I still go out drinking with my coworkers sometimes, but now I'm careful how much I have before making my way home.


On the night I barely escaped death, two homeless men were found frozen to death in that very alley. The news believed they had succumbed to the elements, but I think the Yuki Onna was simply looking for a third course to its long meal. Some nights, when the snow falls and leaves drift on the sidewalks, I sit in my apartment, and just wonder if it's still out there, hunting the streets of Osaka for its next meal.


Then I remember how lucky I am to have escaped the cold embrace of the Yuki Onna.
