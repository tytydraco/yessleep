The Veil’s Blossom

Somewhere deep in the Appalachian Mountains, far off any known trail, there’s a flower that shouldn’t exist. Locals call it La Flor del Velo or “The Veil’s Blossom.” It’s a flower with petals as pale as moonlight and a deep, almost black center. They say it only blooms in places touched by tragedy, and those who find it are either very lucky or very cursed.

Coleman was not one to believe in tall tales, but when he heard the stories of the flower from an old prospector, his curiosity got the better of him. The prospector, a grizzled man missing an eye, had warned him in a raspy voice, “There’s a reason the old-timers leave those blooms alone, son. It ain’t the kind of high a man wants.”

But Coleman had heard whispers that La Flor del Velo wasn’t just any flower—it was a potent opioid, stronger than anything you could find on the streets or in the labs. A single bloom could be ground and smoked to achieve a euphoria so intense that it was almost otherworldly. But along with the ecstasy came something else, something no one wanted to talk about. They just called it “the visions.”

Coleman, a man in desperate need of an escape, decided to find the flower for himself. He spent weeks combing through the dense woods, following vague directions and scraps of old maps until he stumbled upon a clearing shrouded in a heavy fog. There, growing in clusters around a ring of dead trees, were the blossoms.

They were beautiful, almost ethereal. Coleman plucked one, ignoring the unease creeping up his spine. He brought the flower back to his cabin, crushed its petals into a fine powder, and prepared to smoke it.

The first hit was everything he’d been promised. Waves of warmth and comfort enveloped him, erasing every ache and every worry. The pain from old injuries dulled, and his mind felt like it was floating in the calmest ocean. But just as he began to relax, something changed.

Coleman’s cabin, which had felt cozy and familiar moments before, seemed to stretch and distort. The walls elongated, and the wood creaked with an almost human groan. He tried to shake it off, telling himself it was just the effects of the flower, but then he saw it—the first of many visions.

A dark figure stood in the corner of his cabin, barely discernible in the dim light. It was shaped like a person, but its limbs were unnaturally long and bent at impossible angles. Its head twitched with sharp, jerking movements, and when it turned to look at him, he saw that its eyes were empty voids.

Coleman’s heart raced, and he tried to stand, but his legs felt like they were filled with lead. The figure took a step forward, its limbs creaking like old wood, and whispered his name in a voice that seemed to echo inside his skull. He closed his eyes, trying to will the vision away, but the voice grew louder and more insistent.

When he opened his eyes again, the figure was gone, but the dread lingered. He stayed up all night, unable to shake the feeling that he was being watched. By dawn, the effects had worn off, and Coleman convinced himself that it was just a hallucination, nothing more. But he couldn’t deny the allure of the flower’s high. The way it numbed his pain and made the world feel softer, more bearable, was unlike anything he’d ever experienced.

So, he smoked it again.

And again.

The visions came every time. They grew worse, more vivid. Sometimes, it was the same figure with the void-like eyes. Other times, it was a chorus of shadowy children with skeletal smiles, standing at the edge of his bed and whispering secrets in voices that seemed to come from a different plane. He saw his late mother, standing by the window, her eyes gouged out and black blood running down her cheeks. He saw friends he’d lost to war, their bodies twisted and broken, reaching out to him with fingers that melted into the walls.

But the high—oh, the high was worth it. The pain would vanish, and he could forget, if only for a little while. Each time he smoked La Flor del Velo, the hallucinations became more frequent and more intrusive. But Coleman was already in too deep to stop.

One night, as he drifted in and out of his drug-induced stupor, he saw something different. The shadowy figure wasn’t at the corner of the room this time. It was standing by his bed, its face inches from his own. Coleman tried to move, to scream, but his body refused to obey. The figure leaned in closer, its breath cold against his skin, and whispered something in his ear.

“They are watching.”

In his haze, Coleman didn’t understand. He didn’t want to. He just wanted the nightmare to end. The next morning, he was found by a park ranger, wandering aimlessly in the woods with a dazed expression. He didn’t remember leaving his cabin, but the ranger told him he had been muttering incoherently about “the eyes in the trees.”

Back in the village, Coleman was warned again to leave the flower alone. But it was too late. The pain returned with a vengeance, and the whispers of the shadows grew louder whenever he was sober. The only way to silence them was to smoke more La Flor del Velo.

Coleman’s final night came on the eve of a full moon. He crushed the petals into an even finer powder than before, determined to chase the high that had once brought him peace. He lit the powder, inhaled deeply, and waited.

The warmth spread through his body, but this time, there was no calm ocean. Instead, the shadows in the corners of his vision began to writhe and slither. The figure with the void-like eyes returned, but this time, it was not alone. Dozens of shadowy forms crawled out of the walls, dragging themselves towards him with desperate, broken limbs. They whispered his name, begging him to help them, to free them from the place where they were trapped.

Coleman tried to look away, but when he turned his head, he saw his reflection in the window. His own eyes were gone, replaced by black voids.

The pain that had once disappeared now surged back with a ferocity that took his breath away. His limbs felt like they were being torn apart from the inside, and the shadows continued to whisper, their voices overlapping in a maddening chorus.

“They are watching. They are waiting.”

The locals found Coleman’s cabin the next day. The interior was covered in scratch marks and symbols drawn in ash. Coleman was lying on the floor, his eyes wide open but completely black, like twin abysses. The Veil’s Blossom was still clutched in his hand, its petals wilting and disintegrating into dust.

The coroner’s report listed his cause of death as an overdose, but the locals knew the truth. Coleman had looked behind the veil, and something had looked back.

If you ever find yourself deep in the Appalachian Mountains, and you stumble upon a ring of dead trees and a pale, moonlit flower—leave it be. No high is worth the price of seeing what lies beyond the veil. And if you hear the shadows whisper your name, don’t answer them.

Because they are always watching.

And they are always waiting.
