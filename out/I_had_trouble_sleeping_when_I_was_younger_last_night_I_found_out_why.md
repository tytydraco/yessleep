It started when I was 8 years old. At the time, I had begun to have these “jolts” from my sleep. Some point near midnight, I would suddenly be thrown awake, it was like those moments in which you would just be about to sleep, but your body suddenly acts like you are falling, only these jolts would cause me to feel like I was being thrown into the air. My parents at first chalked it up to insomnia, school at the time was stressful for me with all sorts of new classes and information being taught, so I don’t blame them for thinking that at first. However, the jolts were very rare at first, but over time, began to happen every night, and slowly, I would wake up with more panic, screaming and throwing punches at a threat which wasn’t present. 5 days after these more aggravated jolts began, my parents began to think that insomnia was less likely, they began to ask if I had problems at school, things like bullies or mean teachers. I hadn’t really had any bullies at the time, and all the teachers were nice, so the answer was always no. They took me to a few checkups with the local child’s clinic, they found nothing physically wrong, but they noted that I had much more “self-inflicted trauma” whatever the hell that was supposed to mean. They gave my parents a prescription for sleeping pills and suggested that I take one an hour before bed, hopefully to keep me asleep. These pills never worked at all. While I did feel more drowsy before bed, it never stopped the jolts from happening, and they continued to happen every time, at midnight. 



This went on for a while and I just wanted the horror to end, I eventually asked my parents if there was a “Sleep doctor” they told me that while there was no such thing as a “Sleep doctor” they could have me visit a psychiatrist. Soon enough, I was sitting in an office with several toys, fidgets and books scattered about, as Dr. Cole, my psychiatrist at the time, proceeded to ask me several questions. They were ridiculously simple, with questions such as “How old are you? Have you always felt like seeking psychiatric help? Do you sleep well? Do you eat healthy?” and so on. Then after those questions, he took out several papers, the ones with splotches on them to see how the patient's mind works on identifying it. I swear to god, every single one of those papers had 2 large, pitch black circles on either side, so dark it felt like I could stick my hand in and lose it forever. I know that some of them may have had features similar to that, but for me, each one had the exact same spots, empty voids that seemed to stare directly into me. On about the 9th paper, I burst into tears and tried to cower under the desk, as Dr. Cole re-stacked the papers, slid them into a folder, and began to fill out a report. Later that day, my parents were told that I could have a case of mild schizophrenia, where my brain forced images I didn’t want to see onto the paper. My parents were once again given a prescription for me. My father made a fuss, objecting to having his youngest son take pills for a real medical disorder, rather than having it treated, safe to say, I didn’t go back there again.



For months, I had to deal with these jolts, all the damn time, and it got so bad that I stopped sleeping in my room anymore, and just decided to sleep with my brother David. David was 10 at the time and honestly, he didn’t want to have to put up with my shit anymore, but he still let me sleep with him if it got me to shut up. After some time, my birthday came up, the party was supposed to be an excuse for me to get outside time, but with my midnight jolts, my parents decided to let us all stay inside and bond together more. At the party were 3 of my closest friends, two of which I was neighbors with, the last one being a classmate. Along with my friends were two of my cousins, who were at least 5 years older than my brother, but still enjoyed coming over to hang out with us from time to time. During the party, I somehow managed to forget about the jolts, as everyone played games, talked about upcoming events and most importantly, laughed at absurdly basic jokes. In the evening, my brother and I grabbed out our sleeping bags. Then David went to set up the pullout bed from the couch, while I collected blankets and pillows. David stood in front of everyone and told them the sleeping bags were for me and him only, and that the couch-bed would be up for claim, then I smirked as I told them to “Duke it out for the bed”, I had expected a thumb war or a game of rock paper scissors, but instead, our cousins volunteered to sleep on the floor, while my friends arm wrestled for the couch-bed. After deciding the bedding arrangements, we stayed up for a good 2 hours after normal bed time, daring each other to try staying awake longer than the other. Of course, I was the last to fall asleep



As I drifted off, I smiled from the whole day of fun, despite only really staying inside and laughing until we couldn’t breathe. Then, about midnight, I could feel myself being thrown up out of sleep, and the urge to scream and lash out at the closest thing flew by, but my voice, I couldn’t scream, my mouth was open and yet my vocal chords refused to open up. My arms, already in the sleeping bag, didn’t move. I remembered my cousin saying he had moments like this often, sleep paralysis, where you wake up too quickly for your body to register it and unlock your movements. I scanned the room to see if anyone was around, the only things I saw was the mess of board games and snacks, my brother, cousins, and friends asleep, and the large window to the side of the front door. My cousin had always told me that in his paralyzed state, he would always try to keep looking at different things since he knew that the mind would eventually get bored and try to create things like monsters, my brother told him that looking around would encourage the mind to create the demons, my cousin just shrugged and told him that he never saw anything that wasn’t there before. I kept looking at every part of the room I could to make sure nothing changed. When I was satisfied, I closed my eyes and tried to go to sleep. Then, shortly after closing my eyes, there was a rustling sound in the bush right outside the large window, my eyes shot open and I turned to see what it was, I was horrified. 



The man, thing rather, standing outside my window was tall and dark, he seemed to be wearing a black hoodie of sorts, but his face, I could never forget it, a dark, yet pale face, no discernable mouth or nose, and the eyes, they were exactly like the large dots I saw on the paper in Dr. Cole’s office, but they seemed more hollow. Somehow, I managed to scrunch my face up into a scowl, hoping that he would see my anger and leave. He did in fact see the scowl, and turned toward the door, and walked to it, I blinked just to make sure I wasn’t seeing things, but the thing, he was now standing inside of my home, just in front of the window, terrified of blinking, I forced my eyes to stay open. The thing started to walk closer, slowly, my eyes watered and I fought as hard as I could against the urge to blink, until suddenly, I did. When my eyes opened up, the thing was gone, scanning the room, nothing was out of the ordinary. I realized that my body was unlocked from paralysis and I rushed to my brother to wake him up.



“David! David!” I shouted, “There’s a man, I saw him! He’s hiding in our house!” My brother stirred and turned over from me. “Come on David! We need to wake up mom and dad!”



“It’s late dude, go back to sleep.” My brother groaned.



“No! I can’t sleep, David! He’s in our home! He could be waiting to kill us!” I shouted back.



David slowly got up, stretched his arms and said in a yawn “How about we look for this man and if we find him, we can go get mom and dad. Deal?” I nodded. David got up and we began to look around in the living room, under the couch-bed, under the coffee table, and we even checked the hallway closet, there was nothing. We went back to bed and David almost instantly fell asleep, I knew what I saw, I knew it. My jolts after that night stopped, I never knew why, so for a while, I just thought I was going through a fear phase where I was afraid of everything. I’m currently 19 years old and last night, I was proven wrong, when I experienced a jolt, and outside my window, was the man with no eyes.
