It's been three days since my roommate's past officially caught up with her. There have been significant changes to our town. The entirety of the beach is under lockdown, marked off with barricades and flapping tape. Somber-faced men and women in official-looking combat gear stand guard around it at all hours. The buildings closest to the shore have been evacuated. I don't know the reason the residents were given. Probably something to do with the danger of flooding. I don't even think that's a lie.

Kit Sutton has been under near constant surveillance by agency staff. The personnel running in and out remind me of the old days when Nettie Peterson was getting paid to train me. Speaking of which, Kit and I are holed up at her house at the moment. Every couple, there'll be either Mary Markov or another guard to check in on us.

We've had bad weather before, but not like this. The sky is crowded with dark clouds, tall and imposing before the horizon. The sun hasn't been able to peek through in so long that the days passed seem like one long night. The wind is the biggest problem. It's strong, violent and utterly relentless. You can't go outside anymore without it sweeping you off your feet. Nothing's safe—entire trees, lampposts and street signs are lying strewn around town. All the shops and businesses have temporarily closed down, as has the kindergarten. To top it all off, it's obvious that this is just the beginning. The real storm isn't even here yet. It sits a couple miles ahead of the shore like a spider perched on its web, brewing above the ocean and rolling closer and closer with every passing minute. 

I haven't seen Elijah Carter since the stabbing. I called him yesterday and had a rather short conversation. He told me not to worry, but he sounded off. I think he hasn't been well. I can still see him hovering above me clear as day, covered in my blood and trying desperately to keep me awake. I can still hear his voice—how panicked he'd been. I wonder if it's the same with him, and if he's having nightmares, too. I want to speak with him, but I suppose it'll have to wait until the storm's over. Whenever that may be. 

Frankie Preston on the other hand is constantly on the phone with me. If we're not talking, we're texting. I don't know why; there's barely ever an immediate reason for contacting him. Still, I find myself irrationally wishing to share the mundane details of my daily routine with him. Judging from the sixteen blurry shots of different birds outside his window, I believe he feels the same. The hotel he's staying at is a little further away, hardly even in town anymore. Normally, I wouldn't appreciate that kind of distance between us, but I'm glad he's safe. 

Nettie Peterson has been "bending over backwards", as they say, to make Kit Sutton  and me feel better. Her methods are unconventional, but she gets results. She chained me to the sofa—literally—by wrapping a blanket so firmly around me that I couldn't find the strength to get up. She proceeded to force-feed me chicken noodle soup, which she considers medicine. Getting Kit to eat has been more difficult. My roommate has been going out of her mind. Mary Markov and the other agents assured her that there'd be no need for her to return to her old home, that they'd find another way, but so far, it doesn't look good. Down at the shore, the tide has drawn very, very far back. We know what's coming.

We've been thinking feverishly, all of us. We're trying to come up with some idea, some other plan, anything at all. To be honest though, I'm losing hope, and so is Kit. My savior human is clinging onto our last shreds of optimism, but as much as it pains me to say, I can tell she's being fake. There's so much fear in her eyes. She can't keep her voice firm, nor her hands from trembling. She secretly feels the exact same way.

It's been four hours since I wrote this. Consider what I'm about to share an update. Heads-up, I suppose, because it's certainly a drastic one. A lot has changed in these four hours.

I had just received a picture of the pretty soap bar Frankie found in his bathroom when Nettie called out to me from the kitchen. "Where's Kit?"

"In the garden, I think," I replied, not looking up from my book.

"Could you go check on her? I don't want her to be by herself." She waved to me with her oven mitt. "I gotta keep an eye on lunch."

"You don't need to do this, you know that, right?" I asked, arduously sitting up. "We'd probably just be eating instant noodles at home."

"Yeah, I don't doubt it!" Nettie snorted, shaking her head.

"I do cook! Just not at times like this." My back cracked when I got up. 

"Sure you do," she replied over her shoulder, making a shooing motion with her hand to send me off. I trotted over to the glass door separating the garden from the living room and slid it open. Nettie had secured her outside furniture to the spot. The better part of her trees and shrubs had been covered in protective plastic tarp. The rest had suffered immensely from the storm already, much to my best friend's dismay.

Kit was sitting in Nettie's favorite chair, staring blankly at the painted white fence. The wind was howling through the pickets, sending her hair flying and her baggy sweater fluttering. I joined her, moving against the charged air with some difficulty before I was finally close enough to speak into her ear.

"Nettie wants to know if you're okay."

"I'm not," she replied, her voice far softer than usual. "But you know that, don't you? Or do I actually have to pretend?"

"She's trying really hard. Are you gonna come inside with me?"

"I know." The sigh she let out was carried away on the storm. She pushed herself to her feet and followed me inside. I took back my spot on the couch while she walked over to Nettie. They briefly talked in hushed whispers I couldn't understand over the steady humming noises of the stove and oven. Then my roommate got a strange, sorrowful look to her, and the two of them hugged. It was short, but close, and I saw Kit press her nose into the crook of my best friend's neck. It kind of caught my attention; Nettie and I hug all the time but I've never done this. The entire embrace looked different somehow. 

A little while later, the three of us sat down to eat. The meal was an altogether silent affair, neither of us saying more than a couple words. Outside, the wind was whistling, sweeping down upon the roof and rattling the window frames. 

"A shame about your plants," I said to Nettie.

"Yeah," she replied, staring at her plate. "But I'll fix them back up. Don't you worry."

I knew she would. Someone who can raise all kinds of different flowers in such a limited space can no doubt nurse them back to health. After lunch, my savior human went to take a nap and I suppose I fell asleep, too, because the next time I checked, an hour had passed. I rolled off the sofa and took a look outside. The sky had grown darker still. Kit was nowhere around. I lumbered up the stairs, past the rows of decorative mirrors and paintings warmly adorning the hallway. The door to Nettie Peterson's bedroom was open, but I knocked nonetheless. She was lying atop her flower-printed sheets, her glossy black curls spread widely around her head. She would have been the picture of serenity, had it not been for the distressed frown that creased her forehead even in slumber. 

She groaned as she slowly sat up, rubbing her eyes. "What are you up to, baby girl?"

"Looking for Kit."

"She's not downstairs?"

"No. Not in the garden, either. I thought she came up here with you."

Nettie Peterson locked eyes with me, then her face fell. "Oh God."

Realization set in for me at the exact same time. My heart sank and my stomach turned. I spun around. "Kit!" I bellowed, rushing down the corridor and proceeding to tear open each door I came across. I glanced into every room, but found them all empty. She was gone. My savior human head got out of bed and was trailing behind me, collecting our jackets as she went. "We gotta go down to the beach," she pressed out, sounding choked up. Outside, we were greeted by a howling gust of wind. Running was difficult—it felt like the air was actively pushing against us, trying to blow us back into the house. We somehow managed to reach the shore where the guards were already giving us strange looks from afar. They recognized me, though, and soon enough, Mary Markov approached us.

Despite the danger of the situation, she had the same unflappable air about her as before. Her blazer and pencil skirt looked slightly rumpled and her hair was tousled. She'd no doubt spent at least a couple hours down by the waterfront. I asked her whether she'd seen my roommate, but she dodged the question. "I'd like to draw your attention to something else, if I may," she said, extending her arm to point out at the beach. That was when my best friend and I finally allowed ourselves to take in the view offering before us. Far off in the distance, silhouetted against the storm-tossed sky, was a *wall* of water. I could see it rise, growing taller and wider seemingly by the second. It was rolling towards the beach, steadily, slowly, but visibly picking up speed. It was dark and imposing, and deep within me, it sparked a primal kind of fear. The sheer size of the behemoth towering out there at sea made me feel like a tiny insect or a single grain of sand. I wanted to run. Every muscle in my body suddenly felt like it burning, the heat screaming at me to flee, to save myself.

*When was the last time I had laid eyes on something this big?*

Gruesome images flashed before my inner eye. Memories of an enormous black mass in the sky, of an ear-shattering growl that echoed across the plains of a world that hasn't existed in five years, of breeders trying to shield their young with their last breath. Of screams in a language I don't speak anymore. 

It was about to happen again. When this torrent would reach the shore, it would bury everything in its wake. Everything I’d come to know, everything I loved, would be consumed. The ocean would drink away my building, Nettie’s house, her garden, the diner…  

I doubled over and threw up, gazing in shock at the puddle of vomit forming at my feet. I don’t empty my stomach through the head hole very often. 

Mary Markov cleared her throat. “Oh dear. Um, do you need anything? Should I send for some water or meds…?”

“I’m fine,” I muttered, straightening up again.

Nettie Peterson stood still, frozen, her large round eyes fixed on the wave building out at sea. Her lower lip was quivering, and for a moment, she looked like she was about to say something. However, no comprehensive words left her mouth. After a couple seconds, she turned and faced us with an expression unlike anything I’d seen on her before. Intense fear, dread and grief mingled upon her features, her nostrils flared and her brows twitched in a way that suggested she was on the brink of bursting—like a crack in a dam, lengthening and growing before the entire thing would split open. “Where’s Kit?” she whispered, her voice almost inaudible among the wuthering gusts of salt-flavored air.

Mary Markov’s frown deepened. “Don’t you understand, the wave is still getting bigger…”

My pulse was thrumming in my ears, joined by a penetrating ringing. Once more focused on the terrifying vision that took up more and more space before us, I found that I couldn’t look away—I watched, transfixed in quite literally paralyzing fear, as the mass of water grew and grew, swallowing the horizon. 

“Where’s Kit?” Nettie repeated.

“It’s going to come crashing down with more force than anything this town’s ever seen. It’s not going to leave a single house standing—”

“Where’s Kit?”

“Even if we evacuate every last person, people’s livelihoods are on the line here.”

“Where is she?”

Mary Markov sighed deeply, then pointed at one of the high cliffs hanging down over the shore. I could see the faint outline of a person sitting on its far edge. My savior human immediately took off running towards it, and I set out to follow, only to stop when the newsreader placed a cold, sweat-laced palm on my lower arm. “Please be reasonable,” she said softly. “Think of what we’d—”

“I know,” I replied, meeting her probing gaze. She nodded, dropping her hand and allowing me to catch up with my best friend. We headed up the steep incline side by side. I held my breath as Kit’s blue hair moved into focus. 

“Don’t go!” Nettie called out, long before we’d reached the other woman.

Kit Sutton sat in silence for what felt like an eternity. She finally pushed herself up and turned to face us. Her eyes were bloodshot, dried tears puffing up her reddened cheeks. Coming to a halt in front of us, she took in a rattling breath, gently kicking the dusty ground with her heel. “Hi guys,” she began, falling silent again immediately after. Fixing me with a regretful look, she put on a strained smile. “Looks like you’re gonna have to pay rent by yourself again after all. Sorry.”

“It’s okay,” I breathed.

“Is it? You know, ‘cause I promised you I’d—”

“It’s okay.”

“Right.” She sighed. "You've been really good to me. Better than you ought to, actually. Again, I'm sorry."

"You have nothing to apologize for," I told her.

"Maybe not. I just sorta wish things had gone differently." She glanced over at Nettie. "A-anyways, I'm glad you came."

"Don't do it," Nettie whimpered. "Please, please don't—just stay, we can figure it out…"

Kit Sutton shook her head. "Oh, come on, we all know this is it." She reached to grab the hem of her sweater, pulling it over her head and revealing one of her old graphic tees. I'd seen this on her hundreds of times. She proceeded to shove the sweater down my best friend's reluctantly outstretched arms. The baggy top fluttered wildly in the wind, the grayish black color oddly complementary to Nettie's long lime green skirt. Kit stared at her for a moment, her bottom lip caught between her teeth. "But it was nice while it lasted."

With that, she suddenly whirled around, taking a running start before throwing herself off the cliff. For the blink of an eye, her body almost seemed to float, suspended by some unseen string, before dissolving in mid-air, liquefying and dripping down to mix with the masses of water waiting in the ocean below. Nettie cried out, both of us leaping for the edge to look after her. There was nothing to be seen, though. 

I nudged her in the side, pointing at the monster wave. It had halted its unstoppable race towards the beach. More so, it had begun to *shrink*. Abruptly, it collapsed in its entirety. The wall of water that had been building itself up before our very eyes crumbled down, almost like a pacified wild animal. The only trace left of it was the tide rapidly flooding back to our shore, lapping at the rocks and sand. That and nothing more. The clouds crowding the sky burst wide open, giving way to golden sunlight shining down at us. The fierce gusts of wind faded as if tiring of their work, a gentle breeze taking their place. The change was almost startling 

I could see Mary Markov standing below. She was gazing out at the calming ocean, her hands to her hips. She then turned and waved to the guards standing nearby. Looking back at my savior human, I found her wearing that same heart-wrenching expression. This time however, I could actually see her break.

Bathed in sunlight and with the soft, salty air playing in her hair, Nettie Peterson started to cry.
