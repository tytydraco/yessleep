It all happened so fast, just a few days into a camping trip and suddenly I was in a nightmare. In the chaos and aftermath of the event I keep thinking, I should be dead now. I should have died several times over. I don't know what cruel twist of fate or ironic karma has led to me being here and alive, while so many of my friends have been lost.

Lost....... can I really say lost? Deep down I fear they are not just lost.

My hands tremble even now, as I remember the madness of those nights in the forest. Men and monsters, or at least what looked like monsters lurk in those woods. I still doubt everything I saw in that haze of terror. I don’t know where they are now, I barely escaped, and I don’t know if I can bring myself to go back. I don’t know if anything could convince me to reenter that hideous place and look again upon that edifice of horror.

I'm sorry, I need to compose myself; I will try my best to recount the tale of what happened to my friends and I that night, over a year ago on May Eve, in the shadows of Mount Deception.



My friends Kasey, George, Mark, Rachel, Joanna and I were setting out on a camping trip to the Olympic National Forrest in Washington. We were going to be journeying through the forest from campground to campground, hiking, climbing and generally having a great time outdoors for almost the entire week of late April.

We drove down through beautiful countryside on the way through the national forest and toward Deception basin and the camp nearby. Living in the city for so long I had forgotten how nice it really was here in the pacific northwest. This was going to be great for all of us out here on a week-long adventure in a beautiful national forest, with an exciting mountain range to explore. We were well-provisioned and thought we should be set for whatever could happen. As excited as I was to be here, I was a little nervous as well. I was not the most adventurous type and I had not been away from home for so long, even with my friends as company the time we would be away had me a little apprehensive. I felt a hand on my shoulder and looked up out of my reverie to see Joanna. She wore an expression of concern and empathy as she must have read my emotions.

“It will be okay Nick.” She assured me, smiling gently as she spoke.

Joanna was my best friend, almost more like the big sister I never had, she looked out for me and always had my back. She was practically family and after my mom had passed away, Jo would always joke that she had helped raise me, and honestly, she wasn't wrong.

“I know it seems like a long trip, but the time will fly when we are out having fun, and if any of these knuckleheads give you trouble for being homesick, I will kick them in the balls.” She smiled again while pointing to Mark and George and gesturing a mock threat.

“Who us?” Mark said with feigned indignation dripping from the response as he suppressed a chuckle of his own.

“Not me if that's the case, I am smart enough not to mess with Jo.” George agreed quickly while pretending to hide behind Mark. We laughed a bit until Rachel chimed in.

“How much longer till we get to the first camp? I’m so hungry, and I want something warm to eat, these snack bars suck, thanks for managing to pick the one flavor that tastes like dirt Mark.” She said accusingly while also suppressing a slight smile.

“Sorry my lady I didn't realize you had such a refined palate; I have bad news about the rest of the trips menu in that case.” Mark responded with a sardonic grin. George referenced the map and the GPS to double check though most reception would be gone once we got far enough into the forest.

“Probably about ten more minutes or so, keep on this trail.” He said adjusting his glasses slightly.

"That's not too bad, stop complaining and enjoy the sights." Kasey said while rolling down a window and sticking her head out.

We were almost there and excited to start our adventure. After a few more minutes of driving and a few complaints of needing to get there so they could,

“Take a piss like a racehorse.” As Mark so eloquently put it, we arrived at our campsite.

“Don't forget to put up the Discover pass so we don't get fined.” George mentioned as we started unloading the car. He was always fretting over little things like that. Despite being kind of a know-it-all all and sometimes a little too proud of it, he was a solid guy and we relied on him to plan out and research a lot of our trips and shared adventures.

“Yeah, yeah I got it, not like a ranger is likely to enforce it out here, I don't think they even know this park exists in the state park registry.” Mark said, while laughing at his own joke.

“Hey Nick, the cars rides over want a beer?” Mark smiled and was already looking to unpack the cooler.

“Nah I’m good maybe later.” I replied.

“More for me, he cracked open a can and hopped out of the car.

Mark was always on vacation in his mind even when we were at work. He was one of my oldest friends since high school and always managed to bring me out of my shell into crazy adventures. Because of our long history, I normally didn't mind when he got too raucous for his own good. Rachel brushed past both of us holding her brimming suitcase which she had managed to cram half of her wardrobe in by the looks of it. She was holding up her cell phone with the other hand and a half-panicked grimace was plain on her face for all to see.

“Oh my God, I thought these were like, official parks for camping. Don't they have park wi-fi or satellites or something?” She groaned and kept wandering around the campsite vainly searching for a signal.

“Watch where you are walking Rach, the big roots by that tree could be a tripping hazard.” Joanna shouted out the warning, but as if on cue, Rachel tumbled over and fell, dropping her bag and phone in a heap.

“Oh my God!” She shouted in frustration, “If my phone is broken, I am going home, I was supposed to get tons of pretty forest pics and videos to rub in Maddy’s face. How am I going to show that I am having a great time on vacation while she is stuck back home if I break this thing day one!” She laughed a bit like she was just joking, but sighed while turning the phone over in her hand and inspecting it for damage. We all tried not to laugh at her outburst and Mark couldn't resist chiming in,

“I don't know babe, maybe by your logic there's an official state park Apple store to buy a new one.” A grin spread on his face as he watched Rachel's frustration. George started laughing as well but suddenly stopped. Mark looked back just in time to get punched in the shoulder so hard he almost fell down.

“Owww what the hell Jo? I get punched for laughing?” He said in fake outrage.

“At your girlfriend’s misfortune? Laughing hurts more.” She said with a smile and as he was about to respond she kicked him in the shin.“That's two for flinching by the way.” She said as she smiled, satisfied with the conclusion.

“Okay, okay I surrender.” Mark said while bowing low to Joanna as she moved past. She high fived Rachel and went to start unloading the van. As I was laughing Mark elbowed me in the gut and shoved two bags of tents into my hands.

“Come on let's get this setup while the sun is still out.” I agreed and followed him, and we began setting up in our campground. The area was pretty rocky and not the nicest campground, but it was so close to the Mountain and its many trails that we supposed we had to give up something for it. I struggled to get the tents deployed at first but after a while, I had gotten one of the tents up and Mark had deployed his.

I heard a thud and saw the last bag drop down near where I had just stood up and Mark glanced down at me and quickly said. “Oh, by the way, there's one more, that's all you good luck I got to take a quick smoke break.” He smiled and ran away laughing, leaving me with the remaining tent to set up.

Joanna had come along, and she helped me set the last tent up in good time. We had gotten the campground nice and comfortable with our chairs and cooler of provisions.

Kasey was helping collect some firewood since we likely would not have enough for the whole trip, and we didn't see a place to collect any since the ranger station was closed this time of year for whatever reason. I remember thinking it was odd since it seemed a prime camping time of year. As we continued to setup the camp and start a fire, I heard a voice call out from the edge of the campsite. I realized we were not as alone as I thought we were.

A tall man in a baggy ill-fitting ranger outfit approached us along with a younger looking and admittedly very pretty woman. Her ranger uniform also did not seem to fit right but mostly because it exaggerated certain features near the chest and seemed to have an inordinate amount of cleavage and no apparent undershirt to go with her regulation outfit. I tried not to focus on it to not be rude, but as they approached, I couldn't help it and she winked at me as she caught my stare. I felt myself blushing as I tried to duck back a bit while my friends approached the newcomers.

“Hello everyone, my name is ranger Kyle and this here is my associate ranger, Jessica.”

He gestured towards her and she smiled at us all. I looked to my friends and as expected George and Mark were gawking as well, while Joanna remained stoic and betrayed no emotion. Rachel was glaring at Mark and looked annoyed that ranger Jessica had caught his attention as thoroughly as it had ours. Kasey rolled her eyes also unimpressed by the ranger.

“Hey everyone, so happy you decided to camp here this weekend.” Jessica said with another exuberant smile. She almost seemed to pose after and she blatantly leaned in while speaking in a way that almost made Georges jaw hit the ground. The girls groaned at this, except for Jo who spoke.

“I am happy to see there are some park rangers out here, we were not sure what the rules for firewood gathering were, if we were allowed to get our own or if we had to buy some from you. We will need several bundles.”

Ranger Kyle looked confused at the comment and then smiled again and said,

“Of course, right of course firewood. Fresh out at the moment so you all have our blessing to gather some. We just wanted to come check in and welcome you. You picked a fantastic weekend to come to Mount Deception. It is May Eve tomorrow night and we have a few other campers here who are partaking in a midnight celebration. I am sure they would welcome more revelers, it is after all, Walpurgis night tomorrow.”

Walpurgis night? I did not know too much about it, besides being the opposite equinox day to all hallows eve. It was supposed to be a pagen holiday or something. I thought that was interesting a bunch of people were out here celebrating it.

Rachel spoke first in our group with a disinterested, “Eww you mean that pagen witching day? Creepy, why would a bunch of people really go into the woods and light bonfires and freak out over some old holiday anyway?” She rolled her eyes and then sneered at Jessica in particular and went back to camp. The rest of our group shrugged; a bit embarrassed by the rudeness of the statement, but also unsure of what to say to the rangers. Kasey followed Rachel soon after, muttering something under her breath and I thought I heard the word, “Slutty”.

“Well just think about it, and don’t hesitate to ask for anything else. The ranger station is closed, had some faulty wiring. We do have a camp near the mountain if you need anything. It is a little far out but you should be able to find it.” Kyle said.

“Yes, it can get terribly boring there. We always welcome new visitors to stay a while, relax and enjoy coming....out to the wilderness.” Jessica said while never taking her eyes off of Mark. As they turned to leave, she shot one last wink at us and George continued to gawk. Mark leaned on a tree shifted his cigarette and smiled back at ranger Jessica. Now that Rachel had walked away he was being a bit of a dick. No harm in flirting, but on a trip with your girlfriend? It was pretty blatant. I made a mental note to remind him not to be a jerk later.

The rangers left back to their camp. I thought it was weird they were not at the station, the excuse for why they were not had seemed very strange and something felt off.

The silence was broken by George flatly stating, “I’d hit that.” Mark nodded and clapped him on the shoulder and Joanna put her face in her palm and just muttered,

“Men....” We resumed setting up our camp.

It was getting into the twilight hours and we had done some minor exploring near the base of Mount Deception, but we reigned it in to wait for tomorrow for a full day of exploration. There was little discussion over our encounter with the rangers and Rachel was giving Mark a seriously cold shoulder. We had started a nice campfire and were cooking hot-dogs and drinking the awful beer that Mark had brought just because a case was super cheap.

“Ya know Mark.” George said while grinning,

“I could have saved you the 20 bucks and just pissed into 24 cans and it would have tasted the same.” Mark laughed and quipped back.

“It is an acquired taste you ignorant douche.” We all laughed at the back and forth, until Rachel mentioned how,

“You could go share a few beers with the slutty ranger Mark, I hope you two have fun.” That made it a bit awkward and Mark did not say anything to smooth it over besides a halfhearted apology. Things quieted down and Kasey and Rachel had gone to sleep in their tents, George was heading to bed too and waved goodnight. Joanna said she would wrap everything up and go to sleep last.

There was an odd chill in the air that didn't feel quite right for this time of year and something about it made Joanna’s seem tense. Whatever is was, she seemed distracted by what I was trying to talk to her about and more focused on every perceived sound in the woods beyond.

“Oh, what was that? I'm sorry Nick.” She had said while looking over her shoulder and gently prodding the campfire with a stick.

“This place is nice but.... something feels a bit off. Those rangers did not seem right and I don’t like that it seems like no other campers are here. Maybe it is just my imagination. I’m going to wait to go to sleep for just a bit, go on and get some shut-eye I will be fine.”

She smiled again and I took her word for it and went to my tent to go to sleep.

Despite how relaxed I had felt earlier I had a hard time getting to sleep. Maybe what Jo had said was getting me to question our safety out here. I thought the rangers seemed overly friendly and the May eve celebration invitation was strange. This campground was kind of in the middle of nowhere near a not-often-hiked-on mountain, yet it still seemed strange no other campers were here at the site. Just some celebration tomorrow night, but where? Besides that, I felt like I heard something at the edge of the perceived sounds of the forest, a rhythmic chanting or murmuring that sounded like people.

Maybe they were closer than we thought, but what were they really doing?

I managed to slip into a fitful sleep after an hour or two and what little I can remember from my dreams were colored in the paranoid shades of anxiety and fear.

I was woken up by screaming. I bolted upright and rushed out of my tent, still in my boxers.

“Rachel where are you? Somebody help!” Kasey was screaming and pacing back and forth. Her clothes had blood on them and as I surveyed the campground, I saw almost all of our supplies were either gone or destroyed and near Kasey and Rachel's tents there was a trail of what looked like blood.

“What the hell Happened?” I blurted out as I started feeling the air of panic and frenzy overtake me as well.

Joanna was walking around the camp's perimeter holding a large hunting knife and looking around in every direction as if trying to track a scent. Her eyes were narrowed, and she looked very intense.

She softened slightly when she saw me emerge from the tent and I could tell something very bad had happened last night. I just didn't know what the hell it was.

George was there too, he was still in his tent and only peeking out, apparently holding a can of bear mace and begging us to make sure it was safe before he came out.

“I knew we shouldn't have left the food out; I told Mark and Rachel to put the stuff away but they were too busy fighting. It was probably a fucking bear or mountain lion. Both Rachel and Mark, those idiots are probably dead because they did not listen and went out last night.” George whined a sound after his tirade that sounded equal parts annoyed and scared for his life.

Apparently, they had left their tents at some point. Mark having said he was leaving for a smoke had left first. Rachel thought he was going to the ranger camp to see Jessica and followed. There was shouting and rustling and Rachel had come back crying but Mark had not come back. I did not know if he really left Rachel for the ranger camp and an alleged midnight rendezvous, but it didn't matter, Mark had not come back. Rachel left after a few hours to confront him, that was about an hour ago I was told. Now she had not come back either. Kasey had woken up first and saw both of them were missing and then saw that our campsite was totally destroyed along with apparent traces of blood all over.

I thought George might be right about the animal attack, but I realized that we would have heard a scream or something at least to wake us up in the night if that had happened.

Joanna walked back to the tents and the look on her face was grim.

“I don't think it was an animal, and that's not even the worst of it.” She said staring at us while fidgeting with the knife in her hands.

“An animal wouldn't need to flatten our car's tires and take the battery out.” She finished, fixing the rest of us with a stare that almost felt accusing as if to gauge our reactions.

“Wait what?” I demanded as I took in the new horrifying news. On top of our friends going missing in the night, it appeared we were stranded here as well.

I couldn't believe what was happening, my mind raced for answers while Kasey and George looked on the verge of complete panic. Jo’s eyes kept darting back and forth as if expecting some imminent attack from the foggy tree line near the camp.

I looked at my watch and saw it was just after 5 am. I was considering proposing something, but my head started to hurt and I thought I heard a low droning chant again, like the one I had heard last night.

“Do....do any of you hear that?” I asked with a tinge of fear in my voice. I was worried I was alone, but Joanna closed her eyes, focused and then promptly agreed.

“Yes, I hear it too, what is that? It sounds like people whispering something in the distance.”

Kasey and George tried to focus their hearing and listen for the sound but claimed they could not hear what we heard.

George broke the eerie calm first by quickly insisting we leave and get help.

“If we walk, we could maybe reach the main road near the forest border in a couple of hours. It is not ideal, but it could work.”

“And leave Mark and Rachel out there!?” Kasey shrieked back at George and looked like she could throttle him for insinuating the idea.

“It was probably those weird park rangers, they seemed super sketchy I think they were fakes I think they were planning something, no one else is here. They could be hunting us for sport, we need to leave now!” George screamed back at Rachel and turned to me with a pleading look in his eyes.

“Calm down you two.” Joanna said, stepping between the two and trying to de-escalate the situation.

“Whatever we do, we know we can't leave them behind and we also know that we need to work together if we are going to make it back in one piece, right? So, let’s try and at least see if we can follow any trail that was left so that we can try to save our friends and then get the hell out of here.”

Though we were all terrified it seemed as if everyone agreed with Joanna’s plan, myself included. We started searching around the campground and I remembered there was a small splash of blood near the tent. I walked over and examined it more closely and saw a small trail of footprints in the damp morning soil leading away from camp. I also saw a strange hand-print on a tree nearby, but the print looked like it was actively fading away and somehow vanishing before my eyes.

“Over here!” I shouted and the others quickly came to investigate as well.

“We have to follow it.” I blurted out before anyone else could react. I was about to point to the hand print as well, but it was completely gone now. I didn't know how it vanished so quickly, something very strange was happening.

George spoke first. “We don't know where this goes or if there's something dangerous out there. I still think we need to go get help. We can't help them if we get ourselves killed.”

“But we can’t just leave them, if they are hurt, they won't last till however long it is till we get back, we need to go now.” Kasey shouted back at George, venting her anxiety and frustration. Joanna looked deep in thought and finally broke the stalemate.

“We should follow the trail. We should also salvage what we can from the camp and pack it up so if we get lost further on, we are not without shelter or the meager provisions we have left, mostly the dirt flavor bars.” Joanna gave a slight smile as she showed a handful of the snack bars she had recovered, and Kasey groaned. “It will take too long to try and hike back to wherever it is we could find help and I don't like the looks of that bloody trail; I think we have to go now and do our best to be safe about following it. I also think we should avoid that ranger camp unless the trail leads through it. A person was responsible for what happened to the car and I don’t trust them at all.”

We packed up what we could and at George’s suggestion, we left a note explaining our intent to anyone who either came back to camp or found it. We didn't know if it would work but it couldn't hurt if we got lost and someone found it, they could hopefully come looking for us. We followed the trail into the woods but lost it shortly into the afternoon. We decided to keep moving in the general direction the trail had been going, though we were doubtful of moving as far down the path as we were going. It was about 1 pm and as we were trudging on, I considered we may have made a mistake when I paused and heard again the disturbing sound of chanting in the distance.

Jo stopped as well; she was hearing it too. This time George and Kasey stopped walking and I figured they must finally be hearing it.

“What in the hell is that?” Kasey cried out.

“You guys are finally hearing it too yeah?” I said and before I could say another word Joanna held up a fist and pointed in the distance.

“Look over there.” She whispered to us and pointed into the tree line in the distance. There were figures moving about but they looked to be wearing heavy robes and we could not make out any features from this distance. We cautiously moved closer following Joanna as she motioned for us to keep down and stay quiet.

We ducked down near a small thicket and watched. The figures didn't speak, and they moved eerily slow and fluidly almost like they were in some sort of trance. They were taking a sloshing clay jar of some liquid and daubing it on the tree trunks.

After marking several trees with hand prints in some sort of dye one of them started to loudly chant some strange unknown verse of hymn and the marks disappeared off the trees before our eyes. We heard a terrible groaning sound like the trees were starting to bend over somehow. Then the figure put down the clay jar and shouted in the same unknown language, clapped its hands twice and ran off.

Joanna jumped out and was going to try and pursue them when we all froze as we heard a terrible cracking, splintering sound like that of a tree being felled close by. Before we could react two of the nearby trees exploded and the top halves crumbled away. There was a terrible pressure in the air and a thick bank of fog drifted in from seemingly nowhere.

We did not know how those figures could have felled trees so quickly with whatever that bizarre spectacle was, or where this fog had come from so suddenly. Yet as we looked on, we realized with dawning horror that something was moving.

Out of the destroyed tree stumps emerged two large figures. The hulking beings appeared to be close to eight feet tall, maybe taller but they shambled forward in a hunched posture that made it hard to tell. They were covered in gore-soaked animal hides from various creatures in a gruesome patchwork and seemed to have sick-looking skin that glistened underneath with an unearthly pallor. They smelled awful and we stood there frozen with fear. The closest one moved forward, sniffed the air twice, and then let out a blood-curdling roar with a mouth that opened horizontally rather than vertically.

Kasey screamed and ran back the way we had come immediately. George froze in place looking at the hulking things impossible features and was not responsive. I tried to grab George's arm and move him, but he just looked on in disbelief at the nightmare entities that had burst forth from those trees with no explanation.

I was almost right there with him, but pure survival instinct took hold and I forced myself to move. The creatures began moving towards us, acrid drool spilling from the horrible misshapen jaws, it seemed to sizzle and burn the ground where it landed. I grabbed George and pulled but only managed to knock him down. He merely grunted and continued looking at the monstrous sight, oblivious to the mortal danger it represented.

I bent down and tried to help him up and looked to Joanna who by now had drawn up next to us and grabbed George’s collar and hoisted him upright. I was about to speak, but before I could think twice Joanna had gotten in front of us and told me in no uncertain terms,

“Go, now! I will catch up."

“But what about you?” I managed to blurt out in desperation and fear.

“I will try and lead these things away, just go!”

“But you can’t...” I started to protest.

“Now!” She yelled at me while shoving me back and standing strong against the towering forms of the gargantuan abominations.

After a severely delayed reaction, George screamed and finally turned and broke into a manic sprint that I struggled to follow. I looked back once as I fled but the sight was soon obscured, and I heard howling and bellowing from inhuman lungs and the determined sounds of cutting and punching and kicking, and then my heart sank.... cries of pain and a strangled scream.

I barely avoided hurdling face-first into a tree as I ran for my life. The tears whisked off my face as I fled and left my best friend to her fate.
