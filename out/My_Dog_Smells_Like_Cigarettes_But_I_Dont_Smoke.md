Chapter One: Moving In

The house wasn’t anything special. Two bedrooms, a laundry room that smelled like detergent and old wood, a backyard big enough for Ace to run around in. It was the kind of place you rented when you didn’t have the money for something better but still wanted a place to call your own. A fixer-upper, as the landlord had called it. But as far as I could tell, nothing really needed fixing.
Except the chimney.

"Previous owner sealed it up years ago," the landlord had mentioned offhandedly during the walk-through. 

"Best to just leave it alone."

I barely registered the comment at the time. I didn’t care about the chimney. I wasn’t the kind of person who sat in front of a fire with a glass of whiskey, contemplating life. If anything, I liked that it was sealed up. Less maintenance.

Ace had taken to the place immediately. He ran through every room like he was cataloging them, sniffing every inch, claiming every corner. A mutt with a bruiser’s build—part pit, part shepherd, part Rottweiler—he was the kind of dog that looked like trouble but was more likely to curl up next to you than bite.

"Feels weird," 
my girlfriend had said when she first stepped inside, her arms crossed as she scanned the walls. 
"Like… I don’t know. Old."

"It is old," I said. "That’s kind of the point. Cheap rent."

She made a face, but didn’t push it. She wasn’t the type to argue over things that didn’t really matter.
She didn’t move in with me, but she stayed over more often than not. I liked having her around. Even when she was quiet, there was something grounding about her presence. Like an anchor to reality, a reminder that even if I was alone in this place, I wasn’t actually alone.

That first night was restless. Not because anything happened, but because I couldn’t quite shake the feeling that I’d forgotten something. Like when you leave the house and feel like your keys aren’t in your pocket, even though they are.

Ace slept fine. I should’ve taken a lesson from him.

I didn’t think about the chimney again. I didn’t think about anything, really. It was just a house.

For now.

Chapter Two: The First Sign

It was a couple of days before I noticed the smell.

I was sitting on the couch, half-listening to a podcast while scrolling on my phone, when Ace climbed up next to me and flopped his head onto my lap. I scratched behind his ears absentmindedly, letting his weight settle against me. 
That’s when it hit me.

Cigarettes.

It was faint at first, subtle enough that I almost convinced myself I was imagining it. But the more I focused on it, the stronger it got—stale, acrid, like the inside of a car where someone had been chain-smoking for years.

I frowned, leaned in, and sniffed him properly. The smell was coming from his fur.

I pulled back, wrinkling my nose. "Dude, what the hell?"

Ace thumped his tail against the couch, completely unbothered.

I scratched my head. He hadn’t been around anyone but me, and I didn’t smoke. Neither did my girlfriend. None of my friends did, either. The only people who came over vaped, and that didn’t leave a smell like this.

I ran my hands over his coat, checking for anything he might have rolled in. Nothing. Just the smell, clinging to him like a second skin.

"You roll around in someone’s ashtray outside?" I muttered, rubbing at my jeans where the scent had transferred. 

I didn’t think much of it. Dogs got into weird shit all the time. Maybe someone had thrown a cigarette butt into the yard, and he’d brushed up against it.

Still, it bugged me.

That evening, my girlfriend came over. She had this habit of coming in without knocking, kicking off her shoes in the doorway like she’d lived here for years. I liked that about her. Made the place feel a little less empty.

Ace trotted up to greet her, and she crouched down to scratch under his chin. "Hey, big guy. Miss me?"

I watched, waiting for her to react, to pull back from the smell. She didn’t.

"You smell that?" I asked, standing up.

She glanced at me. "Smell what?"

"He reeks like cigarettes."

She frowned, leaning in to sniff him. Then she made a face. "Ew. Gross."

"Right?" I said. "I have no idea where he got it from."
She wiped her hands on her jeans and stood up. 

"You should give him a bath."

That was it. No questions. No curiosity. Just an offhanded suggestion before she walked into the kitchen to grab a drink. She didn’t even seem that bothered by it.

I hesitated, feeling weirdly disappointed by that. Like I was the only one who noticed something was off.

That night, I woke up feeling watched.
Not in a paranoid way. Not in the way where you jolt up, convinced someone’s in the room with you. This was different.

It was the kind of feeling where you’re sure someone’s looking at you, even if you can’t see them. Like an itch between your shoulders, a weight on your chest, something just outside your field of vision that refuses to reveal itself.

I turned over, and my eyes landed on Ace. He was asleep at the foot of my bed, breathing steady, chest rising and falling in deep, even rhythms. 

He wasn’t looking at me. But something else was.

I stared at the darkened corners of the room, half-expecting to see something staring back.

Nothing.

Just shadows. Just my own shitty imagination.

I rolled onto my back and forced my eyes shut, willing myself to ignore it.

It was just a feeling.

But it stayed with me long after I finally fell asleep.

Chapter Three: The Chimney Stirs

The cigarette smell was stronger the next morning.
I didn’t notice it right away, not until I was pouring my coffee and Ace brushed against my leg. It hit me then—sharp, stale, like old smoke trapped in fabric.

"Dude," I muttered, stepping back. "It’s worse."

Ace yawned like he couldn’t care less.

I crouched down and sniffed again, just to be sure. It was definitely stronger. Not overpowering, but noticeable. Like he’d spent the night in a chain-smoking competition and lost on a technicality.

I rubbed my face and stood up. 

"Guess it’s bath time."

Ace groaned in protest but didn’t move. Lazy bastard.

I was getting towels from the laundry room when I heard it.

A whistle.

Not a melody, not an intentional tune—just a faint, breathy sound, like air squeezing through a narrow gap. Like someone pursing their lips but not quite blowing.
I froze. It came from inside the wall.

The laundry room was small, just enough space for the washer, dryer, and a few shelves. The chimney was in here, too—sealed up, forgotten. I barely ever thought about it.

But now, standing in front of it, I did.
I reached out and ran my fingers over the bricks. They felt wrong.

Not bad. Not cursed. Just... off.
Some spots were too smooth, like they had been worn down by years of touch. Others were rough, almost jagged. The texture wasn’t consistent, like the bricks hadn’t all come from the same place.
I pressed my palm flat against it.
For a second, nothing happened.

Then—

A soft click.

The kind of sound a lock makes when it shifts slightly, not unlocking but adjusting.
I pulled my hand back fast.
The laundry room was still. Too still.
The whistle didn’t come again.
Ace was waiting in the hallway when I stepped out, watching me.

I hesitated. "You hear that?"
He blinked once. Then, slowly, he turned and walked away.

Not scared. Not spooked. Just... there.
Like he had already made peace with whatever it was.

Chapter Four: The First Transfer

It was late when I let Ace outside.
The air was thick and warm, clinging to my skin like an extra layer I didn’t ask for. Crickets hummed from the grass, distant, rhythmic, indifferent. Ace trotted onto the lawn, stretching once before shaking his fur, shedding the weight of the house like it had been pressing down on him.

The second he stepped out, I knew something was wrong.

The smell didn’t leave with him.
It should have. Every time before, Ace had been the one carrying it. But now, as I stood in the doorway, the smell of cigarettes was still here. Still around me.
Then the dread hit.

Not the kind of fear that spikes in your chest and fades. This was heavier. Suffocating. Like stepping into a room where the air was too thick to breathe. Like something was waiting. Watching. Pressing in from all sides.
The entire house smelled like it now. The furniture, the walls, the air itself—like I was inside the smell.
My hands clenched into fists. My legs locked up. Something was in here with me.
I forced myself to move, to shake off the feeling, but it stuck.

Then—Ace barked.
A single, sharp noise, cutting through the weight of it all. My head snapped up.
He was at the window, ears perked, staring at me. Not scared. Not panicked. Just focused.
Like he knew.

The second I unlocked the door, he bolted inside.
And just like that, the dread was gone.
Not faded. Not drained away.
Gone.

Like a switch flipped. Like it had never been there.
But the smell—the smell didn’t vanish instantly.
It weakened. Slowly. Like it was drifting, finding its way back to where it belonged.
Back to Ace.

I swallowed, staring at him as he trotted into the living room, circling once before lying down. Like nothing had happened.

But something had.

Something was wrong.

And for the first time, I looked at Ace a little longer than usual, my mind grasping for an explanation I didn’t want to find.

Chapter Five: The Unraveling

It started with small things.

Keys not where I left them. A cabinet door open when I knew I had closed it. A glass sitting in the sink when I hadn’t used one.

Little things. Things you could write off.
At first, I did.

Then it got weirder.

I came home one evening and found the TV on—playing static. The remote was on the coffee table, untouched. Ace was asleep on the couch, head on his paws.
I stood there for a long time, staring at the screen.
Ace didn’t move. Didn’t acknowledge it.
I shut the TV off.

The next night, I woke up to find my bedroom door open. I always slept with it closed.
Ace was on the floor, right where he always was. But the air in the room felt wrong.
Like I had just missed something.

Ace’s mood had changed, too. Not in a bad way, not in any way I could describe, really. He still acted like Ace. Still sat next to me when I watched TV, still greeted me at the door, still ran to the window every time he heard a car pass. But there was something behind his eyes.

A sharpness.

A knowing.

It made my stomach twist.
I tried to shake it off, but every time I looked at him, I felt like there was something I was ignoring to see.

I told my girlfriend everything that night. About the smell. The feeling. The whistle.
She didn’t brush me off. She sat next to me, pulled her knees up to her chest, and listened.
"I don’t know what to tell you," she said finally. "I believe you. I just... I don’t know what to do about it."
I exhaled. "I don’t either."
She reached for my hand. She didn’t have an answer, but at least she was here.

The whistle came again the next night.
Louder. Clearer.
Ace was in the living room with me when I heard it.

The chimney was empty.

But something was still inside.

Chapter Six: The Realization

It wasn’t Ace.

I don’t know when exactly I started to realize it. Maybe it had been sitting in the back of my head for a while, waiting for me to stop looking for the wrong answers. But once the thought surfaced, it refused to leave.

It wasn’t Ace.

The smell wasn’t on him. It was following him. Like a shadow, like something waiting for its turn to move.
The objects that had been shifting—they only moved when he was in the room. But not because of him. They moved when I wasn’t looking.

The whistle wasn’t tied to him, either. He had been in the living room with me when I heard it from the chimney.

And Ace? Ace had never been afraid. Not once.
Because whatever this was, he had always known it was there. He had been carrying it, living with it, taking it with him—until the night it stayed with me instead.
I watched him sleep that night. Not out of fear, not out of paranoia—but because I was waiting to feel that presence again.

It was different this time. The weight was on me now.
Ace slept peacefully, his breaths deep and steady. He didn’t feel it anymore.
Because I did.

I swallowed, shifting in bed. The air felt thick. Like the house was watching me.

I had spent days, maybe weeks, thinking the wrong thing. Thinking it was him. But he wasn’t the one changing.

It was.

The moment Ace had stepped outside that night, the entity had stayed with me. But when he came back in, he didn’t even hesitate for a second to take it back. It had let me feel everything Ace had been carrying this entire time. And I had blamed him for it.

I tensed my jaw and gritted me teeth, staring at the ceiling. It had never been Ace I needed to fear.

It had always been whatever was lingering around me now, shifting unseen through the space we shared.
And for the first time, I let myself see it for what it was.

Chapter Seven: The Breaking Point

I opened the door and let Ace out.

He hesitated for a moment, glancing back at me before stepping onto the grass. The moment he was outside, the air inside the house shifted.

The smell was suffocating.

Thick, clinging to my skin, sinking into my clothes. It wasn’t following Ace anymore. It had settled into me, like a new layer of existence, pressing against my ribs and weighing down my breath. It was inside the house now, inside me.

Ace stood outside now, staring at me through the open door. His ears twitched, but he didn’t move. He was willing to come back in—waiting for me to decide. He was giving me the choice.

I stepped forward, but my legs didn’t want to work. Every instinct screamed at me to stay, to let it consume me, to sink into it until I didn’t have to think anymore.
I forced myself to step forward, to push against the weight, against the thing clawing at my ribs. It fought me. But I fought harder.

The second I stepped outside, it was gone.
No smell. No weight. No presence.
The night air was cool against my skin, and for the first time in weeks, I felt like I could breathe.
I sucked in air, hands on my knees, staring at the ground. I was free.

Ace sat beside me, watching.
Then the thought hit me.

It didn’t leave.

My stomach twisted. It wasn’t gone—it was still inside.
And there was only one other person in there with it.
I turned back toward the house.
I lifted Ace over the fence first, placing him on the other side. He didn’t fight me. He just stared, waiting, watching.

I was supposed to run.

I almost did.

But I couldn’t leave her in there.

I pushed the door open. The second I stepped inside, the smell returned, punching the air from my lungs. The dread slithered back into my bones, wrapping itself around my spine.

She was sitting on the couch, one leg tucked under the other, scrolling through her phone like it was just another night. The glow from the screen lit up her face in soft blues and whites, casting shifting shadows that made her look like a memory I was already forgetting. For a split second, I wondered if she even knew I had walked back in. If she had felt the change in the air, the way the house had settled into something different. Or if she had been absorbed into it already, part of the emptiness.

"We have to go," I said, my voice hoarse. "Now."
She frowned. "What?"

I couldn’t explain. I couldn’t make her understand. I just needed her to leave.

"I’m serious. I—" I swallowed. "I think we should break up."

She blinked. "Wait, what?"

"I need you to go. Now."

Her expression twisted, hurt flashing across her face before hardening into something unreadable. I didn’t care. I just needed her to leave.

She grabbed her things without another word, shaking her head as she stormed toward the door.

I followed, watching, waiting—

The second she stepped through the threshold, Ace ran past me, bolting back inside.

I barely had time to register what was happening before she crossed the doorway.

And then—

The house exhaled.

Not a sound, not a movement, but something deeper, something felt in the marrow. Like the walls had been waiting for this exact moment. Like it had all been leading to this.

The air collapsed in on itself, folding, twisting, turning inside out. The space between seconds stretched and thinned, the room warping like light through heat. The doorway was no longer just a doorway. It was a threshold in the truest sense—a dividing line between what was real and what wasn’t.

My breath hitched. Something peeled away.
The walls bent. The floor trembled. Or maybe I did.
Ace was already inside, disappearing into the darkness as if he had never left at all. My girlfriend—she was still stepping through, her foot frozen midair like time had stuttered, like reality wasn’t sure how to let her leave.

And then it did.

She was gone.

And everything else went with her.

Chapter Eight: The Void

There was nothing.
No air, no walls, no ground beneath my feet. Just an absence so absolute that my body no longer felt like a body. I was here, but I wasn’t.

I tried to move, but there was nowhere to move to.
I tried to breathe, but there was nothing to breathe in.
There was only Ace.

He sat beside me—or maybe he didn’t. Maybe he was part of me now, or I was part of him. It didn’t matter. He was here. We were here.

I don’t know how long we stayed like that. A second? A thousand years? Time didn’t exist anymore, but we existed within it.

I held onto my name at first. My shape. My thoughts. But they were slipping, unraveling thread by thread, breaking down into something smaller, something quieter. Like I was dissolving into the nothing around me.

And Ace—he didn’t fight it.

Because he never had to.

He had always known. He had always accepted.
I think I laughed then, or maybe I cried. Or maybe I did neither. Maybe I just let go.

Ace shifted—or maybe I did. There was no difference anymore.

We weren’t separate. We weren’t anything.
We had always been here.

And somewhere, in the unraveling threads of my fading thoughts, I remembered thinking once—long ago, or maybe just a second ago—that the chimney wasn’t just a chimney.

Maybe you have too.
