I first discovered the wreck a week ago, and I pray to God that I am strong enough to never return to it again. Already, I can feel something urging me to go back. I am a good man and will do my best to resist the temptation. I know already that it will not be easy.

“What was all that about?” said Sarah as we loaded our scuba gear into the back of our old pickup truck.

I grinned, flexing my muscles playfully, “There is something down there.”

“Oh, please. You’re not trying to pull one over on me, are you?” Her gaze lingered on my chiselled physique, a testament to years spent working in the dive industry as an instructor and course director.

“I’m not kidding. There really was something. A submarine.”

Sarah raised her eyebrows and began peeling off her figure-hugging wetsuit, and I could not help but notice the admiring glances of a couple of younger passing tourists. I am sure she was aware of their lustful glances. She exudes an effortless sensuality, and exposing her tanned skin and skimpy bikini does not seem to bother her in the slightest.

“Stop kidding around. We have dived this spot a hundred times at least. You know as well as I do that there is nothing down there”.

But she was wrong.

\*\*\*

It had begun as a usual Saturday for us, diving together as we often do. Sarah is not only my girlfriend but also a talented photographer whose stunning images have graced the pages of international magazines. Her skill and professionalism have won her countless awards, and today, she was intent on getting some shots of an invasive Mantis shrimp species that had started to become more common in the azure waters around the Maltese coast.

As we descended into the water, Sarah immediately began searching for the shrimp. She knew where they were likely to be found, but the search process was tedious. I followed along dutifully, watching her graceful form move through the ocean like a mermaid. However, after ten minutes of this slow-paced exploration, I couldn’t take it anymore. I needed a little more excitement. So I signalled to Sarah that I was going off on my own for a bit, and she gave me a playful wink before continuing with her search.

As I swam away, I looked back and couldn’t help but admire how she moved through the water effortlessly and gracefully. She was more than capable of taking care of herself in these shallow depths, but sometimes, I couldn’t resist the urge to protect and watch over her from a distance.

As I descended into the familiar waters, the sun shimmered through the crystal-clear ocean, casting undulating diamond-shaped patterns upon the enormous blocks of rock littering the shallows. I gently finned over the lip off the drop-off at twenty metres and looked down. My attention was immediately drawn to a large dark shape that seemed to lie upon the sandy bottom at perhaps thirty metres, like a giant guardian of the depths. My heart raced with excitement as I moved closer, and my eyes widened in astonishment as I realised what the object could be. Without hesitation, I swam deeper, eager to investigate this unexpected discovery that filled me with a sense of both euphoria and fear.

The German U-boat had presumably lain undisturbed upon the sea bed for over seventy years, a haunting reminder of the past. Its once sleek and deadly exterior was now rusted and covered in algae, giving it a strange ghostly appearance. As I dove towards it, a feeling of unease settled in my stomach. What tragic circumstances had led to its sinking? And what secrets were hidden within its flooded confines?

At a depth of thirty metres, I would get through my air fairly quickly, and I also had limited time if I wanted to avoid decompression stops, but my curiosity prevailed, and I swam towards the stubby conning tower. Only then did I start to worry that the sub might contain dead bodies. What had happened to the crew? Had they been able to escape, or was their final resting place within the flooded confines of this steel sarcophagus?

I know now that I should never have done what I did, but I could not stop myself. An overwhelming urge gripped me, and I peered through the open hatchway into the mysterious and dark interior of the wreck.

Later, when I returned to Sarah’s side, she was still absorbed in taking photographs and hardly acknowledged my return. Excitedly, I grabbed her arm and shook it, trying to get her attention. She gave me an annoyed look as I thrust my dive slate in front of her mask. After much signalling and insistence, she only read what I had hastily scribbled on its surface in pencil: ‘I found a wreck!’ Understandably, she looked surprised, as we knew there was no known wreck within five miles.

Slightly begrudgingly, she followed me towards the drop-off. I was leading and kept looking over my shoulder to ensure Sarah was still following. I could hardly contain my excitement as we swam over the ledge and looked down. Sarah gave me what I would call ‘one of her looks’ as I stared down at the seabed in disbelief. The U-boat had vanished.

“But there was something there. I saw it.” I told Sarah later as we drove back to our apartment.

“You thought you saw something.” She corrected. “Maybe you were just narked. It looked pretty deep.”

“I suppose that could be it.” I said, “ All the problems with Jurgen and the dive school must be getting to me.”

She smiled and ran her hands through her salty blond hair.

“I’m thinking of taking a long shower when we get back,” she said nonchalantly before shooting me a suggestive glance from underneath her lashes. “And you should join me. You really could use some stress relief. We both could.”

Sarah put the radio on, and we drove back to our beach-side apartment. She sang along beautifully and harmonised with the songs on the radio, and I lost in anticipation of what was promised to come. As we pulled into the driveway and I killed the engine, Sarah hopped out of the pickup and headed for our apartment.

“Come on, slow, coach. Let’s wash off all that dried-up salt together,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper but vibrant with promise. “Perhaps we can find our kind of adventure in the depths of all that shower steam, shall we?”

I grinned and followed her into the apartment.

I did not mention that I had peered down the hatchway into the flooded submarine or that I had explored its darkness.

\*\*\*

All the problems I am now experiencing with my Dive School started about five years ago. As the price of exotic destinations dropped and more unique scuba diving destinations became available, my business slowed down.

My customers seemed to have been lured away by the white, powdery beaches and waving palm trees of places like the Caribbean, the Maldives, and even Papua New Guinea. It was getting so bad that I swore that I would strangle the next diver I heard mouth that well-worn phrase, ‘The Med is Dead’.

Eventually, last year, against my better judgement, I took on a partner, Jurgen. He offered to buy half of my business and bring in lots of extra customers through his network of dive clubs in his native Netherlands. It seemed like the perfect solution at the time.

To begin with, things went very well. After spending so many years of hard work building up my dive business by renovating an old derelict building on the coast, adapting a fishing boat, and paying for expensive advertising in glossy dive magazines, I was suddenly able to relax a little and let my partner take some of the strain. This turned out to be a mistake.

Before long, almost eight per cent of our customers were from the Netherlands, and I was getting hardly any bookings from anyone else. Even when I did have some of my own customers, I got the feeling that they were less than happy that the dive trips were dominated by Jurgen’s customers, who all seemed to know each other. Not too long after, Jurgen came to me insisting that he should get more than fifty per cent of the profits as he was bringing in most of the customers. We argued about this constantly, and it even got to the stage where he threatened to sell his share of the business to someone another acquaintance of his and take ‘his’ divers elsewhere. Two weeks ago, Jurgen announced that he wanted to buy me out. After all these months of bickering, I was on the verge of accepting the less-than-fair market price he had offered me, but that was before I discovered the wreck.

The day after I found the mysterious U-boat, Jurgen took a boatload of ‘his’ customers to one of the local dive sites. Sarah was planning to review the digital shots of shrimp and edit some other work, but the deadline was rapidly approaching. Her ‘little hobby,’ as she had termed it a few years ago, had become a real success.

“Have a great day at the dive school, “ she said, giving me a quick kiss before hurrying off to the room she used as her office.

I had no intention of telling her what my actual plans were.

\*\*\*

An hour later, I was passing over the underwater ledge and looked down. The wreck was there, just as it had been when I first found it: a hauntingly dark silhouette set against bone-white sand. I had not imagined it. The wreck really did exist! This time, I made sure that I was suitably equipped to allow myself a thorough examination of my discovery.

As wrecks go, it was rather odd. It sat upright on the bottom, its ship-like bow slightly buried in the sand. I swam around it but failed to find any obvious damage, making me wonder whether the crew had deliberately sunk it. It just sat there, on the bottom, as if silently waiting, hidden in the depths until it was time to pounce.

Reaching the conning tower, I gazed down through the open hatch. Surprisingly, there was little marine growth around the edges, and after clipping a guideline to the stubby radio mast, I went inside.

My first impression was one of intense cold. I guessed that this might have been due to sunlight from above being unable to penetrate the wreck to warm the non-moving water within it. As I played my powerful torchlight over the interior, a mass of pipework and sheathed wiring, I could not help but feel a sense of great curiosity. There did not seem to be any apparent reason for the U-boats’ sinking.

Due to the confined space, moving around was difficult. I had opted for a small rebreather instead of traditional scuba to avoid the risk of my bubbles stirring up sediment, which could quickly reduce the visibility to zero. The rebreather also offered the considerable advantage of plenty of gas for a long dive and deco stops afterwards.

Fine greenish sediment had settled on every surface, and even my gentle movement through the water dislodged fine rust, which rained down from above, reducing visibility to no more than a metre ahead. My torch, which is hugely powerful and one of the best on the market, seemed unable to penetrate the sombre interior efficiently. It was as if the darkness had a substance of its own. It soaked up light like a sponge.

Cautiously, I edged forward, going deeper into the aquatic mausoleum. The water around me felt somehow thicker, and I had the impression that I was swimming in treacle. The darkness increased.

How could the inside of a submarine be so damned big? I had swum for what I considered a considerable distance, yet there seemed to be no end to the cavernous interior. After another five minutes of finning, I stopped. I figured that I must have swum a couple of hundred metres. There was no way that this type of sub could be so big inside. Hell, it wasn’t anywhere near so long on the outside. It just did not make sense. The other and more worrying reason that I had stopped was fear. My light was almost useless. Examining it, I could see that it burned brightly enough, yet the darkness was somehow darker and hungrier!

It was then that I noticed the smell. I know it sounds ridiculous, but that is the best way to describe it. It was as if I could smell something rancid. A rotting stench that I could taste through the rebreather’s mouthpiece. I inched forward, my heart pounding in my chest and ears like thunder. The ‘smell’ was almost overpowering. Suddenly, I came within inches of some kind of barrier, a wall of thick, undulating darkness. I sensed that the darkness was waiting. For what? I had no idea, but strangely, I felt sure it had been waiting for a long time.

Don’t ask me what made me do it. Curiosity? Stupidity? Who knows. Tentatively, I reached out. I watched as my hand disappeared, engulfed by the blackness. The pain was immediate and excruciating, a freezing coldness that penetrated the very bones of my finger and began to spread up my wrist and into my arm. I had, I felt, touched pure evil. In horror, I screamed, snatched my hand back, and retreated as fast as I could towards the conning tower and its open hatchway. I did not bother to collect my guidelines. I fled for the surface in terror, up towards the light.

I had no intention of ever going back after that first dreadful experience. For two days, I managed to pretend to myself that it had simply not happened. I began to wonder whether or not there might have been something wrong with my recollection of events. Perhaps I was the effects of nitrogen narcosis, though that is not something that has seriously affected me in over thirty years of diving. A distant family member is often described as ‘not playing with a full deck’. She spent some time in an asylum. I hope it is not hereditary.

\*\*\*

I had almost deliberately forgotten about the wreck until I mentioned it to Jurgen. Afterwards, I reasoned that telling Jurgen was an attempt to accept that I was not crazy and had indeed seen something. Of course, now I realise there might have been some other motive for telling him.

From the moment I told him about the wreck, he was hooked. Where was it? How deep? Would it make a good dive for customers? It was the first time there had been any semblance of friendship between us for months. He insisted that we should explore it together. How could I refuse?

As we descended towards the submarine, I watched Jurgen’s face. When the ghostly shape of the wreck began to become visible, his eyes grew wide with excitement. He turned to me and grinned, then finned towards the conning tower. I followed.

The wreck looked exactly the same as the last time I had seen it. A chill of memory shivered down my spine. Jurgen looked down into the wreck and then, seemingly on impulse, took hold of the guideline I had left last time and followed it headfirst down into the gloomy innards of the submarine. I did not want to go inside again but felt grudgingly that I ought to stay with my partner.

Inside, it seemed even colder than before. Jurgen was kneeling on the bottom, looking around with his torch. Holding the guideline, he indicated that I should go first and that he would follow. I shook my head and signalled that he should lead. He shrugged and then set off, with me close behind.

We swam for quite some time before Jurgen stopped and turned to me. He looked confused. We had been swimming for a ridiculously long time, considering the size of the U-boat. He appeared worried, but I gave him the OK sign, which seemed to be all the reassurance he needed. He swam deeper into the darkness. Nervously, I followed him.

Not long after, I began tasting that revolting smell I had previously experienced. The apparent thickness of the water seemed to slow our movements tenfold, and the light from our torches withered to pathetic conicles of light. We had reached oily blackness.

I have no satisfactory explanation for what I did next. Perhaps it was because Jurgen had virtually stolen my dive school from me. It might even have been that I simply did not like him anymore. Whatever the reason, it is sufficient to say that I pushed him into the blackness.

Jurgen fell forward and was immediately engulfed. For a brief moment, I felt relieved. Glad to be rid of him. Then all hell broke loose. His panic-stricken face reappeared through the oily film. His mask and regulator were gone, and he was screaming in terror. I could actually hear his muffled cries as vast bubbles of air spewed from his mouth. The darkness began to retreat deeper into the wreck, and it seemed to be dragging Jurgen with it. His arms flailed wildly. His fingers desperately trying to grab onto something. I could hear and see his fingernails scraping and splintering against the cold metal floor. Then he was gone.

I felt no guilt, only a weird kind of revulsion. It was the kind of excited disgust that I had when, as a kid, I had peered into the gutter at the mashed remains of some poor animal, a cat, I think, that had been hit by a car a few days before. How long would this thing, whatever it was, be satisfied with one person, I wondered. I turned and left. Ascending to the surface, I looked back down, half expecting the wreck to disappear. It hadn’t.

All this happened a matter of days ago, and since then, I have been haunted. I have been haunted by the ghosts of my life, people who have at some time caused problems for me, let me down and disappointed me. Since I have spent most of my life in the diving industry, it is not surprising that most of these people are also divers. It would not be hard to persuade them to explore a virgin wreck of a U-boat with me. It is a temptation that I must resist for the sake of all that is good.

I am a good man.

Last night, I started to draw up a list of potential diving partners’ names. It is just a game, really. I do not intend to do anything with this list.

I am a good person.

The list is a lot longer than I had expected…
