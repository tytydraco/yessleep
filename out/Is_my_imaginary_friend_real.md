You know that phenomenon when you can feel something is right behind you and your brain begins to subconsciously create physical and auditory sensations to justify it.



The warmth on the back of your neck to the faint sounds of inhales and exhales. Culminating in a looming shadow, reaching around your extremities like a strait jacket, permitting only one primal response. Turn around.



Well, I think I’ve been experiencing that all my life. I can’t say how long it’s really been occurring, rather I catch it in those moments when I’m completely alone. In those short minutes where I’m obscured from the eyeline of another living thing, it rears its head.



It’s never malicious, not causing my swivel out of fear, rather curiosity. Those alien eyes burning into the back of my head or inquisitive glances over my shoulder, simply illicit my full attention for the short time I notice them.



With an unknown entity so close as to feel its presence, the only answer is to look. Though as quickly as those sensations take hold, they’re gone when I turn to meet my ever-present shadow.



Replaying that action like a favourite movie, I’m always left wondering why. Why is that sensation so strong if only to turn my attention to a vacant space?



Speaking to my parents on a similar topic, they recall me having something of an imaginary friend. Frequently in my early years, they’d catch me talking to myself, nothing strange for a child, but even in my adult life I know I talk to myself in situations where I fear the silent solitude.



Maybe there is a being there, either we grow up and loose our perception of it or as adults we just cover it up. Maybe I’m not the only one.



I’m a sceptic, I always have been, but after today, some memories have come flooding back.



Back in my late teens, I’d gone down for a drink in the early evening and in my rush to hop back on whatever game I was enthralled in, I left the kitchen door open, allowing our family dog to wander up after me.



With my mind hyper focused on the task at hand, I didn’t even register his presence at my door, until he barked. Indy was a quiet dog, didn’t even kick up a fuss at the small animals that frequented our back garden, but the way he carried on as if there were an intruder, rubbed me the wrong way.



Similarly, Jesse, my older sister walked in on me when I assumed she was out at her friends. Something about her forgetting her brush in my room, resulting in her making me jump. I don’t know how I could have ever forgotten the face she pulled.



If fear had a physical, tactile visage, she wore it like a mask. Not sure whether to freeze of fly out of my room, her complexion a ghostly white for the second or two her eyes were transfixed behind me.



Though as quickly as she had been traumatized, she reverted back to her jovial self, grabbing her brush and drop a Jesse coined, “Snake you later”, bourn from a childhood game.



Speaking to her about it after that experience, she seemed none the wiser, not even able to recall a single detail about what seemed to be the most fear inducing thirty seconds of her life.



That could be their M.O, inducing a bout of amnesia in order to hide their existence, though to what end? Simply to observe?



The nexus for this rant came about this evening. We’d had a power outage, but our backup was clinging to the last vestiges of life. Walking the hall after taking a leak, my focus was on the flickering bulb overhead, resulting in me stubbing my toe on our large, ornate full-length mirror.



Being the only person in the house, I didn’t feel it necessary to hold in my curses at the inanimate object. With my conscious mind fixed on the pain blitzing through my toe and my shouting match with the mirror, my eyes lingered on its reflection for a split second.



Under the dim flickers of light that incandescent bulb radiated, I witnessed it for the first time. Like a dream shrouded in layers of thick haze, obscuring the full picture, I got a sliver of its figure.



Looming over my shoulder, a dense black silhouette observed through an eyeless face. Its rippling form, moving to mirror mine perfectly.



The moment I witnessed that finite glimpse, its form evaporated like a long-forgotten memory. Rushing into my room and slamming my back up against the wall, I’ve been trying to solidify that image, but its deteriorating fast.



Writing it down is at least staving off its degradation, keeping the vision somewhat palpable, though I can’t say if what I’m recalling is even the full picture.



That niggling feeling of its ever-present gaze has changed now. It seems perceiving its existence is a two-way street, and it knows that I’ve seen it.



It’s masterful at hiding itself, though if my experience is anything to go off, it must be linked to my latent cognition. If I truly believe I’m alone and its presence is a minor thought swirling in the endless pool of my consciousness, then for a fleeting moment its tangible.



I don’t know what this means, why they’re here or what happens now. If my memory is anything to go off, I’ve seen them all throughout my life, though in the end, I never remember.



Maybe tomorrow I’ll open this site again and deem these words a tired ramble, deleting my experience all over again. At least I’ll be around long enough to catch myself at the end of the loop again.
