I don't know how I can write this and have you believe me, but I will try.

My name is Chaucer Heim. I was born three thousand years ago. If you have ever heard the expression 'History is written by the victor, I can assure you this much is true". Your first thought is likely 'how is this possible?', and to be honest with you I am just as confused. I know now that people no longer believe in magic, as they did in the time I come from.

I never did either, but this, this wasn't magic.

I was born to a culture of people you have never heard of, and to a place that no record of exists. I have studied the maps and can tell you the place I am from has been swallowed by what is now called Mediterranean Sea. There are many things that I could write here so I have to prioritize.

The gist of what has happened is this; my people who were related to the Goths departed Europe in 1000 BC and headed south through Greece settling on on an island New Aegea (see 'Aegean' and also 'Aengland').

I know what modern perceptions call to mind when speaking of Ancient Greek islands that vanished under the sea. I will tell you this by my sword, Plato spoke of Atlantis as utopia, but he was wrong.

Atlantis was not the utopia, they were the destroyers of it...

In that time we we're apart of what was considered the Mediterranean Union: Greece, Rome, and New Aegea. I was a fighter in my youth, and not an educated man so please excuse my crude writing and lack of historical knowledge. My thinking has become more brutish and dull since I awoken, but I will get to that.

The important part is what I have to tell you because it's more relevant than ever.

In those times our people lived peacefully. It was a time of enlightenment and idealized depictions of Greece and Rome could not compare to the reality. It was truly utopic.

We were foolish in thinking it would last...

I was twenty eight years of age when I heard the warning horns blow. I still remember the look in Hildeklaus's eyes. I grabbed her by the shoulders and looked at her deeply 'I will return' I told her fighting tears back. I never found her.

When I got to the shore where the men were making a commotion, I saw then what I could hardly believe. The luxury of time has afforded a vocabulary that can explain what we had seen that day, but in that moment the best we could describe it as were 'Floating Vessels'.

You may now know them as 'Airships'. To modern sensibilities this would have been like seeing UFOs... Be 'ware, that these were not blimps or planes, rather more akin to what you see depicted now in 'fictional' media.

It was a procession that I will never be able to forget. The first ship was entirely gold. At the bow stood a man in an ornate garb (or what I thought was at the time) waving to us with a beaming smile. Some of my fellow Aegeans cheered. It was truly a spectacle. Beside that man was a woman, but she was not able to hide her (quickly to be revealed) disdain, unlike her companion.

There were several of such ships that flew in tow. A ship which seemed to be perpetually aflame crimson and purple. One that was entirely platinum and cobalt, sparks of electricity jumping from a floating orb at it center, evidently a generator for the ships power. A stern and muscled man sat on a throne overlooking the rest of the fleet.

Finally were the men in sets of completely silver armour flying, propelled by winged boots, their leader with staff in hand. The ships were en route to the palace.

Many of the men found the spectacle amusing and began to chatter excitedly. Some, like myself were not, for we knew "Those who come for peace, don't flaunt weapons of war".

I got to the palace just in time to confirm my fears.

"Hello 'Sir' King" the man in silver said in a grandiose and subtly mocking tone.

"Greetings, and who are you to bring these flying war ships to my Kingdom?"

"Sir, sir to you I am a merchant. See, I bring no ship. See, that I come to you in humble boots" the man laughed, prompting all the other to follow suit.

"None the less" he said in a sickeningly fake placating tone "I can guarantee you, I come bearing treasures and gifts as an offering to you, your Kingship." Servants approached and placed chests of precious metals and gems, fabric and spices.

"We are a prosperous people, we need no thing, but tell me, what is your intention here?" The King said sternly.

"Please, please, listen to me closely. I come to bring you only one thing... peace"

"That is all any good and honourable man should value in life" The King responded

"Then you will have your peace king" the man said, his voice filled with hate

"REST IN IT!" he yelled as he lifted his staff and plunged it into the King's chest.

"Betrayer..." the King said as blood spattered from his mouth.

At this the Silver clad man raised his hand and clenched his fist and a loud sound was emitted from the golden ship. At that the archers aboard began to release their arrows on the people. The bloodshed was unlike any battle known to us. It was a slaughter. I looked up to the man and woman on the golden ship as the arrows flew. They were laughing. Laughing like it was the funniest thing they had ever seen.

I detested them.

A few of us were able to flee due to knowledge of an underground tunnel system but not many. Aegea had fallen. I made my way to Athens, and in time they did too.

When the Greeks and Romans heard of the carnage in Aegea they were stunned. It wasn't long before they would witness for themselves, the blood-lust of the Atlanteans. It was a nightmare, and in a way it still is. The Atlanteans went to the Egyptians and in exchange for technology and the building of the Pyramids they would fight alongside them, against us. The odds were impossible.

This was dread.

When the Atlanteans arrived in Greece, however, it was different. I was there in Hellasopolis that day when they arrived. When 'she' arrived.

Shakespeare asked 'what's in a rose, by any other name'? I can tell you based on my experience that day, everything.

When she and the other one appeared in the plaza people cheered. I knew then it was over.

They traded Greece for an olive tree... Athena.

I write this to you on nosleep... I know (it's one of the few channels still available because no one would suspect it) but I 'll tell you real fear is seeing the hatred that seeped through the cracks in the guise of her phony smile as the Greeks danced around that Olive tree. From that day forth Hellasopolis was known as 'Athens'.

By now I think you may have the picture. It wasn't difficult for them to destroy Rome after that. From what I see in the history books, it seems as though they toyed with them dwindling their society away and fracturing it over the course of the next thousand years. I can only imagine what events they have completely rewritten as they did with Aegea.

So why do I write this now? Recently there have been many reports of UFO sightings and Mexico has even unveiled real 'aliens'. I can tell you this for a fact, that 'thing' from Mexico is not an alien. The Atlanteans are the 'aliens', they have never left.

Don't buy the olive tree, that's all I can say regarding that.

As for the how I'm writing this to you, that, I can not fully answer. What I recall is this... after Athena took Hellasopolis I knew that things would never be the same and from the looks of it, they would only continue their quest to conquer. I decided I would return to Aegea in reconnaissance.

I was able to sneak aboard a ship as a stowaway and return to the capital. The entire place was filled with slaves working for who knows what ends. I made it back to my home. I knew I wouldn't find Hildeklauss but, nonetheless, it was still crushing.

What happened then though I can only describe as fate. The man who had been placed in my home happened to work one the private estates of the Atlantean known as 'Chronos'. We decided on a plan. The next evening I would confront Chronos and find out what the Atlanteans were planning.

The last thing I remember was sneaking into his room. I lunged at him, somehow I surprised him. The look on his face was uncanny, as if he had never been surprised about anything. My blade pierced him and he winced in pain. I think catching him off guard is the reason I was sent to this time. In his pain I believe he reacted without thinking and somehow sent me to 2023.

I don't know how it is possible, but it was like one second I was there and then nothing but silence. The next thing I recall I was waking on an cruise ship south of Italy. I can only assume that I must have 'blipped' back into reality in the same spot, though only now Aegea is beneath the sea, and by fate (or perchance not) I landed on that ship.

I can't say much else for now. I think they may be coming after me. I have seen no direct signs of them but many subtle ones that I cannot get into further.

I will say I have found a great deal of interest and hope in the Holy writings of the Jewish people, I believe the story of Aaron's Staff is relevant. I will be making my way to the Holy Lands.

I will not be able to respond to this post or reply to anything. I know the amount of questions this raises is enormous but the answers are there. Remember truth is stranger than fiction.

Pray for me as I will pray for you.
