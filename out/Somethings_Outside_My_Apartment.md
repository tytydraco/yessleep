I don’t know if I’m losing my mind, but I need to write this somewhere before it gets worse.  
  
I live in a small two-bedroom apartment on the edge of town, not quite the city, but not the countryside either. It’s one of those complexes with identical beige buildings, a half-empty parking lot, and a chain-link fence separating it from a strip of woods that no one really goes into. The kind of place where people keep to themselves.

I’ve been here for two years. It’s quiet, which I like. Or at least it was.

About three weeks ago, I started hearing this weird noise outside my window at night. Not just a random noise, it sounded like *someone* walking. Not heavy footsteps, but slow, dragging ones. Like bare feet on pavement.

At first, I thought maybe it was one of my neighbors coming home late, or some raccoons going through the trash. But the sound didn’t make sense, it would stop right beneath my window, stay there for a few minutes, and then move toward the fence that leads to the woods.

After a few nights of that, I started looking out the blinds when I heard it. But I never saw anyone.

Until the fifth night.

That night, I was up late working on my laptop when I heard it again, slow, scraping steps on the sidewalk below. I peeked through the blinds. The motion light by the parking lot flicked on, and for a split second, I saw a figure standing near the fence.

It was tall, *too tall*, and thin, but the proportions were wrong. Like someone who had been stretched out. I could see its outline in the yellow light. It had long arms that hung lower than they should’ve, and its head tilted like it was listening.

Then the light turned off, and it was gone.

I didn’t sleep that night.

I told my neighbor the next morning, a woman named Danielle who’s lived here longer than I have. She looked uneasy when I mentioned the woods. She said she’s heard weird noises too, especially around 2 or 3 in the morning. Crying, sometimes.

“Could be coyotes,” she said. But her voice didn’t sound convinced.

I tried to brush it off. Maybe it *was* an animal. I even left my phone recording one night while I slept, just to prove it was nothing.

When I played it back the next morning, most of it was silence, until about 2:17 a.m. That’s when I heard footsteps, then this sound like someone whispering, really close to the microphone. It was too quiet to make out, but it almost sounded like my name.

The next night, I left the phone recording again, but when I checked in the morning, the file was corrupted. Just static.

Things got worse after that.

I’d find the motion light by the parking lot on when I woke up, even though it’s supposed to turn off automatically. My trash can got knocked over twice. Once, when I stepped outside in the morning, I noticed what looked like *handprints* on my window. Not fingerprints, full, flat palms. Too long. The skin had left smudges, like it was damp.

I tried calling the building manager, but he brushed it off as “kids messing around.”

Then, about a week ago, I got home from work and found something sitting outside my door, a dead rabbit. Its body looked twisted, like its neck had been turned completely around.

I didn’t even touch it. I called maintenance, but when they came by, the body was gone.

That night, I heard someone knock on my door around midnight. Three slow knocks.

When I looked through the peephole, no one was there. But I could hear breathing.

It was deep and uneven, like someone trying to imitate what breathing *should* sound like.

After maybe thirty seconds, it stopped. I didn’t sleep again that night either.

The next morning, I noticed muddy footprints leading from the front door to the sidewalk, bare feet, large ones, with toes that looked too long.

Danielle moved out two days later. She didn’t even tell anyone. Just packed her car and left.

I don’t know what’s happening here.

Last night was the worst.

Around 2:30 a.m., I woke up because I heard something tapping on my bedroom window. I live on the second floor, so there shouldn’t be *anything* tapping on my window.

When I looked, I saw a face pressed against the glass.

It was pale, almost gray, and the eyes were too big. The mouth was open, moving like it was trying to form words, but no sound came out. Then, this part still makes my stomach turn, I realized it looked like *me.*

The same eyes, the same hair, but wrong. Like someone wearing my face but not knowing how to use it.

I fell backward, hit the nightstand, and by the time I looked again, it was gone.

I haven’t told anyone else yet. I don’t even know how to explain it.

But tonight, as I’m typing this, I can hear it again, the dragging footsteps outside, moving up and down the sidewalk. Every few minutes, it stops right below my window.

And I swear I just heard it whisper my name.
