Sophomore in Velvet High Land I’m not a big religious person per se, but I grew up with a family in Cubeston Ohio who fell in that stereotypical group of the nut jobs that take it too seriously reading too far into a sentence, think of your classic high school English teacher you groaned and cursed and everyone murmured them when they weren’t around, not having to worry about getting told on about because well…even if the teacher offered to give them a bit of a boost in grade for being an informant.

As many of you already probably guessed it’s not the best town and is late in modern technology the mayor does not have enough funds to support a lot…as most people are using whiteboards and projectors our schools are left with chalkboards and a 2 ft tv’s with old recorded lessons as the teachers would commonly have to pause the old rusty sound to add information or point out information that is out of date and not true..

even the architects of the town layout weren’t all that good a high school being built next to a gas station that was the only place for liquor and fine-ish wine, you probably passed by our town a lot when you drive on those hour long high ways to meet your relatives and cousins you barely know, it’s very secluded and not even on google.


I guess the only good thing going on here is the busy work people not minding others' beliefs even though I don’t believe in anything they do  I have come to respect it..the main gathering place in the town is a giant hand pointing at the sky..1 week ago and 3 days I took my sick nana there to get some dinner because my family was at church doing some volunteer service and my older sister Landa who also stood to facts and more courage’s then I ever could hope to be was at home taking care of her cat she just got her stock of insulin because she’s type 1 diabetic and my family liked to be prepared for a month longer just in case a truck couldn’t make it in the town so if a tree blocked the entrance she could last for two months… 


my nana had been sick for some time now paralyzed from the waist down I had to push her on her wheelchair..she always seemed nervous by the giant hand-gathering point I didn’t want to admit it but it made me feel uneasy too..the black and brown copper splashed on it a bit as it looked like it was trying its hardest to finish turning green and as I walked my nana by you she looked it all over trying to see for some reason how long she could guess it would take for it to turn fully green..


she said it was just a fun game ..but I get the feeling she’s hiding something as we’re about to enter a restaurant.

she mumbled something saying this town is cursed and we should leave before the hand turns fully green…she always said that each time slowly getting more and more urgent..she only relaxed when we left town..but our whole bloodline is here ..

her mother died here and on her deathbed around 10 years ago she whispered something to my nana that shocked her everyone was curious about what she said but shortly after my nana's mom died..and it was my nana who carried the knowledge..the oldest in the family would pass on there knowledge and wisdom to the second eldest when they felt there time was close..

they were always scarily accurate on the feeling of when they were going to die..when the shadows on the wall were going to extinguish there candle..that’s what I heard from everyone that’s what they always said..when there time was getting near..


I pushed her past the door to enter the restaurant as she said…she’s all of a sudden not feeling too well and we should go back home and get takeout out…she always..loved dining so I assumed this was serious so I turned back walking slowly to the house not noticing the green grew more on the copper hand statue as I pushed…god, I hoped I would have noticed.

The next day I woke up feeling groggy and sore rubbing my eyes as the fog cleared my dizzy sleepy mind and I heard crying…I went down the stairs and my nana unexpectedly died in her sleep laying on the couch without warning…no feeling it was their last day no words..but even though they said she was asleep…there were words in blood on the floor backward saying “The day of reckoning is near”

I felt chills down my spine trying to focus seeing my family crowding around her they already called someone to clean and collect the body for a burial. There was no foresight or warning that their time was near at least that’s what I think.

I’m going to have to stop here those..things are out there as it’s turning day …I know my oldest sister the one that needs insulin is alive for sure as she and I were looking for her cat in the woods when it just started…when those…things appeared, ill tell the rest of the story later I don’t want to use all my battery on my laptop..this was the only page I had opened that could be sent to people being Reddit whenever I tried to open a new tab it wouldn’t work, anyways I need to prepare for when day comes . I hope I will write back soon.
