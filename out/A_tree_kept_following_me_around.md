I first saw it when I was eight years old.

It was late in the afternoon, and I was playing in the woods behind my grandmother’s house. She lived in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by sprawling forests, and I hated every minute of my summer visits. She was a kind old lady but always distant. Whenever I lazed around the house, she’d tell me, “Go outside and play.”

One cool day, I wandered farther than usual into the woods. I was throwing rocks at a bird when a rabbit darted past my view. I chased it, watching it dart and weave through the trees. The deeper I went, the quieter it got. The air felt heavy—so heavy it sat in my chest.

The rabbit juked sharply and ran across a clearing, and that’s when I saw it.

It stood in the middle of the clearing, blackened and gnarled, like it had been struck by lightning but refused to fall. The bark was split and cracked, with strange knots that looked almost like faces if you stared too long. The branches twisted outward, like skeletal fingers clawing at the sky.

A tree.

I froze, unsure of why it scared me. It was just a tree. But something about it felt…off.

“Greg!” my grandmother’s voice called out, startling me. “Come inside! It’s getting dark!”

She had a trumpet for a voice, and I whipped my head around so fast it almost came off. I ran home. Just before I left the clearing, I turned to get one last look at the tree. It must have been a trick of the light, or maybe I was looking in the wrong place, but it was gone.

I didn’t tell anyone about it. What was I supposed to say? That a tree disappeared? Even as a kid, I knew how crazy that sounded.

But after that day, I kept seeing it.

Sometimes it was in the woods, sometimes in the fields, sometimes along the side of the road when my parents drove me home. It was never close, never in the same spot, but always the same tree. Blackened, twisted, and impossible to forget.

By the time I turned twelve, I convinced myself it was a recurring dream, a trick of my mind. The sightings stopped as I got older.

I’m 36 now. Married, stable job, decent life. My wife, Ellen, says I overthink everything, and she’s probably right. That’s why I didn’t tell her about the tree when it showed up again.

I was walking to my car after work, the late shift at the hardware store. The parking lot was empty except for the streetlights buzzing overhead. I left my lunchbox on the car’s roof and opened the door. As I reached for it, I saw it—standing at the edge of the lot, partially obscured by shadows.

My heart stopped. It looked exactly the same as it had twenty years ago. Twisted. Charred. Watching.

I blinked and rubbed my eyes, and it was gone.

For weeks, I told myself it wasn’t real. Work stress, lack of sleep—there had to be an explanation. But the appearances became more frequent. Not every day, not even every week, but enough to leave me on edge. Sometimes in the distance, other times much closer.

One day, I saw it outside the window of a café where Ellen and I were having breakfast.

“What’s wrong?” she asked, noticing the way I froze mid-bite.

“Nothing,” I lied, forcing a smile.

But it wasn’t nothing.

It followed me through the years.

It was there on the day Ellen and I moved into our first house, standing at the edge of the yard as we unloaded boxes. It was there the night our son, Sam, was born—I spotted it in the hospital parking lot when I went outside for air. It was there at my father’s funeral, a dark silhouette against the gray sky.

I tried ignoring it, pretending it didn’t exist. But the more I ignored it, the closer it seemed to get.

One night, I broke down and told Ellen about it.

“It’s a tree,” I said, pacing the living room. “I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s been following me my whole life.”

She stared at me for a long moment before sighing. “Greg, you’ve been under a lot of stress. Maybe you should talk to someone.”

“I’m not crazy,” I snapped, louder than I meant to.

“I didn’t say you were,” she said softly, her eyes full of concern.

But I could tell she didn’t believe me.

I slept on the couch that night.

One evening, I called my friend Sean to grab a few drinks. He was my oldest friend, the kind of guy who could make you laugh even when everything felt like it was falling apart.

“Greg,” he said, slurring slightly after a few too many, “you’ve been weird tonight. What’s going on?”

I debated whether to tell him, but the liquor loosened my tongue.

“There’s this tree,” I began. “I know it sounds insane, but it’s been following me since I was a kid.”

Sean laughed. “A tree? What, like it’s stalking you?”

“I’m serious, Sean. I see it everywhere. It’s real.”

“Alright, show me,” he said, waving a hand.

“It only appears sometimes, man. You don’t understand!”

Sean laughed again, but when we turned the corner, we saw it standing under a streetlight.

Sean stopped laughing. “What the hell?”

“Do you see it?” I asked, my voice shaking.

“Yeah,” he said slowly, taking a step forward. “That’s… creepy.”

“Don’t go near it,” I warned, but he didn’t listen.

He walked up to the tree, reaching out to touch its bark. As soon as his hand made contact, the air seemed to shift. The branches creaked, and Sean stumbled back, clutching his chest.

“Sean?” I shouted, rushing to him.

He didn’t respond. He collapsed to the ground, eyes wide open, staring at nothing.

I looked up at the tree. It hadn’t moved, but I swear I felt it watching me.

I moved my family across the country after that. I wanted to believe I could escape it, leave it behind.

But it followed me. It always followed me.

Years passed. Sam grew up, went to college. Ellen and I got older, slower. But every time I saw the tree, I felt like that kid in the clearing again.

By the time I was in my sixties, it had stopped hiding. It stood outside my window every night, a silent reminder that it would never leave me.

One cold autumn evening, I couldn’t take it anymore.

I walked outside and stood in front of it. The wind was still, the air sharp in my lungs.

“What do you want?” I whispered.

The branches creaked, but the tree didn’t answer.

I reached out, my hand trembling as I touched the bark. It was cold and rough, like stone. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, a wave of memories flooded my mind—every moment I’d seen the tree, every time I’d tried to forget it.

And something else, too. A presence, ancient and vast. It wasn’t threatening. It wasn’t kind. It simply was.

It had been with me my whole life, not as a threat, but as a witness. A silent, unyielding shadow, tied to me in a way I couldn’t explain.

When I pulled my hand away, I felt an odd sense of peace. The tree didn’t move, didn’t follow me back inside. It just stood there, as it always had.

Watching.

Waiting.

And for the first time, I let it.
