Basically, the story begins with that ability - or talent - of mine: sometimes, I just up and come up with some really badass ideas and concepts. I could tend to my own business somewhere, or just sit and relax, and then suddenly, I just have a fully-elaborate concept in my head. Like, I could just sit on a bench in my front yard, stare at various things and listen to the sounds of Nature *(and a faint voice of my parents talking to my grandparents talking about something in the house),* and then **BAMM** and I've got a fully-fledged concept of Pygmaoreans, the short people who live miles under the earth's surface in the underground tunnels and cities they themselves made. No, not just "hey, there are ancient gnomes living underground from the time before the man". I've got a detailed enough history, culture, and customs of those gnome-people - I just don't post it right here, since this is kinda off-topic and will be possibly as long as my message itself.   
And then I was like, "Hey grandma! Did you know there are Pygmaoreans living under the ground?" And my granny listens to my story, and then says things like *"Oh, what good fantasy you have here, my dear"* and pats my head or gives me an ice-cream. I've lost count to the amount of stories I've made up this way. I still don't precisely know how do I do it; it might happen spontaneously, when I just up an come with a huge story out of the blue; other times something happens, and it triggers my mind to put a long, detailed concept together. Sometimes ex-nihilo, other times it's relevant.

And when my parents were once talking  about Christ and how good it is to follow His teahings (I'm not religious, so I don't care much), my mind have put a big story, again. *"Christ isn't the ONLY deity, dumbasses. Holy shit. You don't even begin to understand how vast is the world of gods - and just how many there are of them out there. Then again, who's to blame? You only know what's written in the books, written, unsurprisingly, by the humans. And it's as if you don't know stuff can be made up."*

This is the beginning of a long train of thoughts I've experienced back then.  Even from my knowledge of Christianity (which is remarkably shallow), this is definitely not something the Church would approve. But this somehow look more realistic than whatever the religious dunces usually come up with. Simply because I haven't found any glaring fallacies in this one. Not like I've just up and trusted it - I prefer an approach you could call "scientific": until something is either undoubtedly proven or mercilessly debunked, it's in the "maybe, maybe not" zone. But since "maybe, maybe not" is definitely more trustworthy than "I'm almost absolutely sure than it's not", the attitude I held towards those official Christian teachings, I kind of grew to associate Christianity with my version of it.

In my version, Jesus Christ wasn't even Jesus Christ - that's just the name humans gave him. And since his real name (pretty much as every other god's name) just can't be spoken or written in any human language, well, he just went with the Jesus Christ name while he possessed a human form. That's right, possessed - Gods themselves are incorporeal and whatever bodies they seem to be in are just "vessels". Things they use to interact with this world. Their real selves, the "souls", are basically immortal and untouchable. So when those Romans got "Jesus" nailed, his spirit just up and left the world and re-entered it with a newly-prepared vessel (don't ask me how they make them and how they interface through them, I just can't find the words in any language I know to describe that). The second, third, fourth - and many more -  comings of Christ have already happened and no one gave a fuck about that. Actually, it's more like those of the same kind as Christ have been coming to this world more times than anyone cares to count. 

Let me clarify something: while Jesus himself (and those of the same species as him) do bring about miracles in this world, it's nothing like using a few fishes and bread to pull a whole bunch of food out of his ass like he did to feed an entire city or village or what was it - and he didn't walk  on water  as well. Gods' miracles usually come in form of great inventions (think of Tesla or Leonardo Da Vinci, for example) or revolutionary ideas (such as embracing constructive debate in search of truth instead of pushing you point using whatever power available, and acknowledging the value of the sovereign individual, along with their liberties and potential merits, insteal of looking down on them just because they're "peasants" or from a lower social layer). *Basically, many of those things which give humanity a technological, ethical, or societal  push forward.* Many of them were made by the "Jesus-kind" temporary visiting this world through a human body acting as a sort-of "vessel".

Of course, for one "Jesus" acknowledged by the humans as significantly worthy, there are hundreds if not thousands of those neglected, or outright abused by humans for being "weird". Pretty much every "Jesus" has a different mindset, and a different system of beliefs - but it's not like they would really quarrel  over it or throw one of their off the sky and call him a fallen angel just because they disagree. You could say they disagree all the time, if only they would have "time" as it exists in this world. And nevertheless, they align perectly fine with one another. If there is anything all "gods" have in common, it's their friendly and understanding attitude; they all strive to live in peace and harmony, and though they do know of violence (and are not against using it if really necessary), they try to avoid it whenever possible. Not like the humans do, not the "well, we kinda want peace,  but those assholes just can't leave us alone (read: won't take a knee before us and proclaim us their masters/won't accept our faith or ideology)". Not this kind of "peace and coexistence".

So, though this concept came out  of the blue to me, it still looked more natural to me than whatever religion humanity  could come up with. Even though I've always treated it as "it might or might not be true". Better than any of the *"a god came from the sky, and he gave us a book, you must all abide by the book and ask no questions or we'll kill you 'cause that's what God wants" bullshit.*

Now, I have a good friend - he's from another country, and I've stumbled upon him accidentally in comments for some post on the internet, fuck, I don't remember what social network was it - and we chat often and chill out over the web. You  could say he's mentally closer to me than anyone who  lives nearby. So one day, when we were talking about Christianity and religion in general, I've  started using concepts from my understanding of Christianity without giving much thought about it. Talked about the other gods, about how different a god is from a human, about how much those "gods" already did for us through their human forms while being here and how much they could've done for us if we wouldn't have been close-minded, violent jackasses who've been picking on them and outright refusing to hear them out most of the times, and he was like, *"Yeah, I can agree with you. I mean, Tesla have literally invented a death ray - and he just kind of stashed the project away from human eyes, knowing well they would definitely not use it for good, instead of using it to become the Death Emperor like most humans would do. Surely it's a sign that he's not of the human race."*

**And this was the point when it fucking hit me.** We've been talking like that for a while, and we've agreed with one another almost entirely. But I've been using my  own perception of religion this whole time. He was talking to me from my viewpoint as if he perfectly understood it! But I've kind of made it up in a flash outta nowhere, and I didn't spread it aggressively enough so it would be known by a dude from another country, and known well enough to keep up the conversation...

*"Ugh, look. I've just noticed. How do you know exactly the same interpretation of Christian religion I have?"* I've decided to be the most direct with this one. Not like I've thought of anything better back then.

"What do you  mean?" he says, then followed by a "Hold on..." and, after a few minutes of silence, he came back. *"Look, now that I think of it. This vision of what gods are, well, I can't really remember where did I come with it."* Then, after a pause, "Wait a minute, it looks like something I've come up with a long time ago, actually! I just couldn't believe there are people who believe in that stupid Bible book, and... Well,  it just kind of came to me. Not like I've been treating this one seriously, either. But surely better than any of that religious bullshit others believe in."

A thought have crossed my mind, that I'm possibly talking to a version of me from a parallel world (possibly with one small difference which makes him intractably evil, too) So I've started asking him things he could possibly know should he actually be the (evil?) me - events from my life he shouldn't know a thing about. Turns out he really didn't know what I'm talking about, as his entire life - from the childhood to what he is today - is entirely separate from mine, and he's even several years older than me.

We've talked a bit more. I've asked him about some other concepts which I know to have "popped into my head outta nowhere". Well... he knows about Pygmaoreans, he knows about the Ice Castle high above the sky (which existed before the time of man and is now nothing more than a bunch of little ice shards scattered across the ionosphere), and he knows about the "Long People Who Lifted Up To The Stars" *(one of the older civilizations, originating from the Earth, have managed to master interstellar travel, and before the Earth got snowballed some time in the past, some of them have managed to evacuate from the Earth and settle several dozen light-years away on a slowly-rotating desert planet around an orange dwarf).* He didn't know about the "blue moon spectacle" *(apparently, some time soon, for some reason, the moon will appear with a distinct blue-ish hue some night)* and neither he knew about the "Nuclear Jupiter". *(This one's about a half-secret human experiment launched somewhere in 20th century. They've constructed a probe and sank it into Jupiter to test out some sort of nuclear fusion which, apparently, would be easier to perform under great pressure. Needless to say, they all, except for one, did perform that fusion - in form of a loud, powerful explosion, and one of them simply became a dud.)*

I've also learned some new ones from him. The one that left the biggest impact on me is what he called "The Secure Cell". According to the story, nearly every civilization on this Earth have, during their evolution, became a sort-of, well, maximum security prison. In all of these civilizations, common people desired primarily to be fed, sheltered, and cared for; things like freedom, or the potential to grow, were largely of no meaning for the common people. Exceptions were considerably rare, and so, these civilizations ended up turning themselves into sort-of prisons, where the majority voluntarily surrender their freedom and privacy in exchange for safety and basic provisions - such as guaranteed food, care, and limited pleasure. Their life became increasingly governed by all sorts of standards, guidelines and other rules; ironically, this kind of tight control is always what played a large role in their downfall.

So... For a few days, we've been exploring these interesting similarities. How come the tales I've made up in my head spontaneously and instantly match so closely to the tales a dude from another country did?.. Since none of us believed in the "mental illness" theory (not in the least because of our "plausible until thoroughly debunked" mindset), the "collective psychosis" was a poor explanation. There's an interesting phenomenon before us, so why not play with it?..

And several days later, we've started noticing strange things. Even stranger than the sudden near-total match in stories we've supposedly made up independently. At first, it was that Google started giving both of us wild conspiracy theories out  of the blue. So I look for something on the web, and a random search result on the first page catches my attention with certain words and phrases - I clicked out of interest, and here we go, a page with some bizarre content appears before me! And it's nothing like your typical BS popular with various ideological nuts, like *"the military is gaying  up  frogs"* or *"those who want to keep their weapons are terrorists who want to kill us all!"*.

For example, the first page I've clicked was telling me how the gods have been visiting the Earth for as long as it existed, how they've helped all civilizations grow, their role in uplifting pre-sapient beings... This stuff was actually interesting. So interesting, I've actually read it despite looking for something else (I don't remember what exactly). The story told me that every civilization on Earth got uplifted by the gods at various points; that gods entered this world  in a temporary form matching the body of the civilization's main species from time to time, and when they've managed to get attention from the civilization  living at the time, it usually ended up  with some contribution which have pushed that civilization a bit forward in technological, artistic or in social affairs. And at some point, these civilizations eventually collapsed. But  some of the people were saved, one way or another.

Another page spoke of the existence of the souls; it said that, some of us are actually spirits resising in human vessels, and without that "spirit" the human is little more than an animal that can be trained to speak (to a degree) and perform simple labor. The "spirits" do not inhabit every human body - in fact, there are far more people without the spirits than there are those with them - and that the "spirits interacting with the world through their vessels" are responsible for, well, nearly all (if not all) progress, as they were almost always the ones who came with revolutionary ideas or brand-new mechanisms. Or created great works of art.

The same page then said all spirits have a certain capacity to "talk" with one another, and selectively receive information from their own world - but since they don't talk in any human language, it is often hard for a spirit-in-human-body to translate the received concepts into human consciousness. It's just like with foreigners who know a bit of language, but not the customs or the culture of the people of a nation; there'll always be concepts native to that country which just don't exist in the foreigner's homeland. And the world of gods operates an entirely different set of natural laws - they're unreachably far above the entire physics of this world.

Anyway, this is all interesting and stuff, but I've got curious as for why does Google sling this material towards me. Is it an aberration  of my own perception, or something else? The dude from before did receive the same sorts of material, but so far, we two were the only ones I know to meet this strange behavior of search engines. I've tried using different search engines for a while; turns out not all of them exhibit this kind of behavior. The big ones - Google, Bing, Yahoo Search - do give me random stories like that, while the smaller and lesser-known ones (Startpage, DuckDuckGo, Mojeek, and the Russian one called Yandex) did not.

At some point, I saw the story of the Long People who Fled to the Stars on one of those strange sites. The same story I've made up once - and told to my friend in a private conversation using a messenger - the story was written exactly as I know it. I don't remember if I told this story to anyone else, ever, like I did with some other things that just popped up in my head - but this wasn't one of those which've gained any considerable popularity. And it was reproduced absolutely identically to what I know! Sure thing, I've asked my friend whether he had ever published it anywhere - he says he had never even told this one to anyone.

After a few more strange pages, and finding one more story which I remember never, ever telling to anyone, not even to my distant acquaintance, I've decided to run a small test. Either the people believing in "mental illnesses" are right and I'm totally fucked up in the head, having illusions of Google and some other search engines stalking me with weird content - or, Google does indeed stalk me. After all, plausible until thoroughly debunked...

First, I've pulled out an old laptop I haven't been using since I was a teenager, and brought it to a cafe with public Wi-Fi available. I know a bit about web surveillance, so I've guessed Google and other big engines might know me by my fingerprint and typing style; so I've altered my typing speed and style to the best of my abilities, and made some searches. Nothing. No weird results leading to some shady websites with addresses made of random letters and numbers hosting a bunch of weird stories. Okay. I've visited a friend of mine, and used Google from their machine. Nothing here either.   
Next move, inviting a friend to my house and have them use Google from my machine. The weird pages were there, I did click on them and my friend have confirmed their existence. "Dude, what's that weird shit?" - that was roughly their reaction.  
Next, I've tried using my Android phone (the one I rarely, but still use for internet) from a public Wi-Fi (both the same hotspot as with the laptop, and a different one). The weird content is there in both cases. Well, not  impossible since they might know me either by some cross-site account matching, or by measuring my behavior via event tracking.   
Last move, the one to tell me whether I have hallucinations or there is something Google wants from me... I travel to another city, buy a brand new cellphone there, travel to a third city, do Google searches from there using public Wi-Fi... nothing.

Knowing that I'm not insane, I come back home. Boot up my PC. Launch my messenger, to have a talk with the dude from "over there". And what I see, is a new message from an unknown contact. Called "The New Ark". Asking me to add them as a friend. "Well, why the fuck not add them? There are already creepier things happening to me."

The response was rather swift. No more than thirty seconds after I've added them, they asked, "So, did you visit the pages? Those we've slipped into your Google searches. Talking about the history of earlier civilizations, and the nature of the gods." Well, seems like whoever's stalking me decides to talk to me. I was considerably scared at the moment - who knows what do they actually want from me? Nevertheless, all those horror and thriller movies have taught me one thing: don't behave like a little panicked dumbass when weird shit hits the fan. So I told them straight, that I did read some of these pages, and I sure as hell want to know more about this whole ordeal because, frankly, if they want something from me, they better lay it as it is. No creepy web stalking.

And they did lay it as it is. "Wait a while, it  might take some time. There's a lot to tell you. By the way, if you will have any questions - ask us via this channel. We will answer the best we can." And then, he sent me a zip-archive, divided into several parts - each part is of the maximum allowed filesize for my messenger.

I've just finished reading, watching, listening to this. All sorts of documents, narrations, evidence of this and that. There's a lot to say, so I'll try to summarize to the best of my abilities:

There exist immortal, untouchable beings known as "souls" or "gods" or "spirits". They're roughly the same thing; they exist in some kind of a "spirit world" absolutely unreachable by anything from this world. The entities living in it live above physics themselves - they are governed by a set of laws above physics, a "super-physics" if you will. This way, they can get into this world and act to a limited extent; one example of such interaction is possessing a human body and interacting with the world using it.

Since even  before the first lifeform on this Earth, the "gods" have been observing this universe. Though none of them have "created" it, like the common religious tales tell, they've made quite an impact on this world; it is thanks to them that the matter have appeared - it is them who've shifted the balance between the matter and antimatter slightly, which resulted in the entire material Universe forming from the primordial chaos. So,  one could say they sort-of have created the universe as we know it; without their little push, there would be nothing but a bunch of energy, resulting from mutual annihilation of both matter and antimatter, existing in equal amounts before the interference.

The spirits' interest in this world is still unknown; whether it's just a game for them, or they routinely interact their world as some part of their life, is not certain. What is known is that nearly all of them have a friendly, peaceful attitude - they strive to live in perfect harmony with those inhabiting this world. Every time they came here, they were mostly helpful, and in those cases they weren't rejected or abused  by the inhabitants of this world, they usually gave a considerable push to the entire civilization they were working with - either in form of some technology, or an improvement to the civilization's socio-political affairs. Or even by providing great works of art.

The spirits are considerably different,  in their ethics, values, views and mindsets, from every civilization inhabiting the Earth so far. Their rather gentle and peaceful nature leads to them preferring nonviolent interactions, and preferring peaceful exchanges as the engine of progress, as opposed to war. While humans value and respect raw strength, the spirits give no special value to it, instead giving their respect to one's mental abilities - both the general intellect, and the special capabilities and talents. While humans traditionally resolve most their disputes either through intimidation or through combat, the spirits have a tradition of debate and an approach based on arguments and logic.

This, of course, leads to a huge incompatibility between the spirits and regular humans; unable to understand each other, they rarely live in harmony. For one successful spirit like Jesus or Tesla, there are thousands of those neglected; they're never accepted, never listened to. Ironically, the adepts of large religions following the (distorted) teachings of one of those benevolent spirits ended up killing lots of spirit-carriers for things such as "heresy" and "blasphemy".

It's not like the spirits don't care outright for the suffering they endure in their human bodies; it brings them considerable discomfort. While they still try to resolve the problem peacefully, if pushed far enough, they will resort to force and violence - and their attitide will change from "make peace with them" to "eradicate the threat completely". Since violence isn't something spirits are used to, they won't follow the instinctive strategies native for humans - the goal will not be "show them your power, and cease assault if they show ssubmissive behavior or retreat". Nothing ilke the typical behavior inherited from animals; once the spirits have identified something as a threat, the only attitude towards them is "erase, completely".

In fact, the spirits do not "love" or "like" the humanity, or humans in general, or any other civilization of this world. The only ones whom they feel sympathy for, are other spirits - those like themselves - so they're trying to make the world better for the spirits. While they try to make it better for humans as well, so mutual benefit would occure, their primary goal is the well-being of other souls. Not humans in general.

Basically, things were going fine until roughly the 20th century. A century and something after the humanity (under the guidance of some of the spirits) have accepted the value of the individual, and the merit of intelligence and constructive discussion, violent and fallacious ideas have appeared - resulting in some of the most oppressive and authoritarian regimes of the 20th century. For an average human, it wasn't too bad since they could eat, live and work even under these regimes; but for spirits, it was a total nightmare, since their needs are far above basic animal needs.

In many countries, various sorts of oppressive movements began taking root, threatening to make life unbearable for the spirits, globally. No matter how hard they've tried to fix the situation, it never became better on any significant level for any long period of time; their efforts were either malinterpretted, turning their benevolent ideas into oppressive narratives, or outright disregarded after some time. Though their ideals are said to be upheld by many countries, and even form a part of their constitutions - it is more than just easy to circumvent these principles, or outright ignore them.

Overwhelmed with omnipresent malice and oppression, the spirits are no longer benevolent entities seeking harmony with everything. They now have a firm understanding that the civilization they're dealing with is nothing but malice. Only suffering will come from living with them. And while they're still benevolent and peaceful in their nature, they understand that this particular bunch of assholes shall be dealt with. Nothing personal, just the need to destroy these particular nuisances so they'll stop being a threat for the spirits. Erase them. Get rid of them. No more showing then the horrors of so-called "hell" to discourage the others from being aggressive. Just get rid of them.

This have already happened five times. Five times the civilizations were eradicated, each time through a similar scenario. Not even once it was due to an unfortunate natural calamity; the spirits have helped every civilization survive every natural disaster so far. And when these civilizations became a disaster themselves... the spirits just helped them eradicate themselves.

"If we can't stall the decay into oppression and malice, if we can't reverse them... let us accelerate them, intensify them. Let their own fire of destruction ravage them. When they burn out, our kind shall come up again, to live in peace and harmony." This was what one of the people behind the whole "6th Ark Initiative" have said.

As you can possibly guess, the people behind the initiative believe themselves to be the spirits in human bodies - and the reason why they're looking for people like me is, well, that somehing in our expressed behavior tells them we are spirits, too. As for how do they find us... Well, you'll probably be shocked to know just how much data is gathered about you by those surveillance systems which are reportedly "for your safety". And even more is gathered by the web surveillance. And of course, the spirits' organization have managed to gain access to those vast amounts of data and use it for their own needs. Such as seeking out other spirits - and more.

The initiative itself is basically the attempt to gather all the "spirits" so they would be relocated in the safe place while the "fire" will rage across the human civilization. As for the "fire", this time they plan to use the human stupidity and violent tendencies against themselves. Basically, the plan is to gather all of the oppressive/faulty/authoritarian/violent movements which are popular among humans, crank the madness to the eleven, and let the humans destroy each other in a wave of especially intense holy wars and power-struggles. Now that the communication networks span the entire world, not just one of these movements dreams of world domination. "A world under \*\*ism! We'll just get rid of all those who don't agree with us, and rule the entire planet and be happy for all the eternity!" This dream have proven to be attractive enough to start brutal, bloody wars full of atrocities throughout the entire history of humanity.

Of course, none of the spirits wants a fellow spirit to be caught in cross-fire. Hence, the "6th Ark project", as the organizers call it. The effort to pull every human who has a soul away from danger, while the humanity crushes the skulls of their own people in their struggle for dominance. Every time they've killed each other off this way. All the five civilizations before the humanity.

Right now, the humanity is being pitted against itself, for roughly twenty years already. Various social and political movements are being agitated over bullshit issues and made-up causes; they're slowly being prepared to lash at one another when the signal goes off. Meanwhile, they're reportedly preparing to save all the spirits, down to the very last one - they say they've got many, many places where the spirits would "wait out" until the humanity fucks off for good.

I've asked this... these... whoever's managing the account that reached out to me. How long do I have to prepare until they launch that self-desctruction of humanity, how do they know if you've saved all of the spirits, and what if their intentions become public? This is what they've told me:

1. *Based on all the observations, the shit will hit the fan somewhere between 2030 and 2035. By this moment, they're planning to extract every single spirit, and put them in one of the "safe places".*
2. *The 6th Ark people have literally immense amounts of data on nearly everyone; ironically, the spirits seem to be the least known, as they're often very stingy about their privacy. Which already places them in a list ofpotential spirits, making search even faster and easier. And even if they flood the system with false, forged data... there's always something which might give some of their important traits away.*
3. *This is literaly what they've told me:* ***"In fact, you know what? You can upload the entire set of documents somewhere right now, post the links to all major social networks, advertise them, and the only ones who'll give a shit are the fellow spirits. Because they'll be the ones to actually read and listen. This is something we've tried to do for ages - to communicate with the humans, to warn them of incoming dangers when needed, and to stop them from fucking everything up. They've never listened. They will not listen now."***
