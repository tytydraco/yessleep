Once upon a time, there was a small, isolated town named Millfield,  surrounded by dense, foreboding forests. The town was infamous for its  strange happenings and the eerie darkness that consumed it every night.   


One day, a young woman named Mary moved into the town, eager to escape  the memories of her past and start a new life. She had heard stories of  the strange goings-on in Millfield and was eager to experience them for  herself. But what she found was far more sinister than she could have  ever imagined.    


Mary couldn't resist the urge to explore the forests, despite the  warnings of the townsfolk. As she walked deeper into the darkness, she  felt a sense of unease that grew with every step. Suddenly, she heard a  voice, and she turned to see a figure shrouded in darkness, advancing  toward her.   


"I am the Guardian of the Forest," the voice boomed in her mind. "I am  here to warn you that the darkness is not what it seems. It is a portal  to a world beyond our own, a world of terror and despair, where you will  never return."   


Mary was terrified, but she couldn't let go of the hope that she would  finally find peace in this strange world. She begged the Guardian to  allow her to enter the portal, promising that she would never reveal its  secrets to anyone else.   


The Guardian reluctantly granted her request, and Mary entered the  portal. She was transported to a world beyond her worst nightmares. The  sky was blood-red, and the ground was covered in a thick, sticky  substance that she quickly realized was blood.   


As she walked, she encountered creatures of unspeakable terror, their  twisted bodies and razor-sharp claws a testament to their insatiable  hunger for flesh. Mary tried to escape, but she was pursued by these  grotesque beings, who seemed to sense her fear and revel in it.   


As she ran, Mary stumbled upon a clearing, where she was confronted by  the Guardian of the Forest. He told her that she must leave the world  beyond the darkness and never return, or she would be consumed by the  horrors within.   


But Mary was unable to resist the lure of the other world and she  returned, time and time again, each time experiencing even greater  terror and violence. Eventually, the creatures caught her, and she was  horrified to see that they were not just mindless beasts, but beings  that enjoyed the suffering of their prey.   


They tore her limb from limb, feasting on her flesh and drinking her  blood. Mary's screams echoed through the darkness, a warning to all who  dared to enter the portal.   


Years passed, and the town of Millfield was consumed by a darkness that  no one dared to enter. The townspeople whispered of the young woman who  ventured into the portal and was never seen again, and the Guardian of  the Forest stood watch, a silent reminder of the horrors that lay beyond  the darkness.   


And as for Mary, her soul was trapped in the world beyond, forever  doomed to suffer the horrors that she encountered there. Her final  thoughts were of regret, and a longing for the peace that she had sought  but would never find. Her blood-stained bones lay scattered across the  ground, a warning to all who dared to enter the portal and face the  horrors that lay beyond.   


The darkness of Millfield was a reminder that some things are best left  untouched, and that there are forces beyond our understanding that we  should fear. The portal remained, waiting for the next unsuspecting soul  to enter and suffer the same fate as Mary. And the Guardian of the  Forest stood watch, a silent warning of the horrors that lay beyond the  darkness.
