I had just got back from the grocery store and had arrived home when I decided to go ahead and check the mail. 

I live by myself and have never had a girlfriend, so I have been used to shopping by myself all the time. No pets either, just me and my little home, my home…sweet home. 

I could have just drive to the mailbox now thinking about it, but that doesn’t matter anyways. But, I head out the front door of my house after unloading the groceries and make my way over to the mailbox just down the street in the cul de sac. 

It was a hot summers day in the middle of July and my birthday would be coming up in just two weeks. When that time comes, I will be visiting my family for a little bit and head back home.

Walking down that crosswalk to get to the mailbox, was… well it was very tiring with the sun beating down on my face. As I got to the mailbox having to take a break from the heat and just breathe, I grab my keys out from my pocket, and unlock my mail slot number 11 and reach my hand in it expecting to get the usual boring junk mail. The type of junk mail that says something like, “CONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE JUST WON $10,000 AND… A NEW CAR!!!” 

*such a dumb fucking scam!*

But this time when I grabbed the mail, something was off. Something felt… DIFFERENT!?

The other mail that I felt was just the typical paper, but this one was silky smooth and felt like plastic was covering something. The thing was big I could feel by running my fingers down it, and it was in the shape of a square. 

“Is this a book? A picture book? A movie cd case perhaps? A video game???” I said to myself in my head. “What the fuck is that?!”

“I don’t have any recollection of buying anything online.” I said again outloud this time. “And even if this was something I ordered online, I know for sure it wouldn’t have been a book or a movie, a video game probably, but one that big?” I begin to think about if I should actually get this thing and maybe just leave it in there because someone could have accidentally put it in the wrong slot, maybe the worker who delivered the mail just mixed up the names and gave it to the wrong mailbox number?

“Well, fuck it. I’m gonna see what this shit is!” I said. I then finally grab the thing and pull it out.

The first inspection of it was that it was pitch black. No words on it. Not even a sticker that shows you bought it. Not even a “to and from” on it! 

“Ok, this is weird. But it was probably just someone wanting to drop something off for one of their friends and accidentally put it in my slot. Makes the most sense at least!”

Heading back to my house in the hot pounding sun, I walk down the crosswalk and away from the end of the cul de sac, turning a corner to get to my house. The other boring and useless junk mail, staying put wedged between my fingers. 

I arrive home and open the front door, go inside, and close it behind me. With excitement and interest, I rip open the “mysterious package” that I got. Behind the plastic covering on the inside was the typical covering for whatever was inside the paper slip. Opening that up I saw… a vinyl record.

One of those old vinyl records that people used back then. People still use them to this day but now since everything is online, they aren’t so common anymore, especially to but, yet ship to someone!

I then realised, “How will I listen to this? I don’t have a record player. I guess I will have to buy one real quick from Walmart or something.” I said to myself while throwing away the junk mail. 

Heading over to Walmart, I find the section in which the record players are, and look at the price. “Only $59.99, that’s not so bad.” I said while making a delighted expression on my face.

Checking out and bringing it to my car, I head back home with anticipation on what this mystery album will sound like and if it will be good or not. 

I head through my door again and something, some feeling in my stomach, told me to lock it. So I followed that feeling, since it always seems to be right, and deadbolt locked the front door.

I head over to the nearest table and finding an outlet to plug the record player in. I take out the mystery vinyl, and place it on the player. “We gonna be ripping some bangers tonight!” I said with excitement.

But the thing that was weird, is that the vinyl record was just black, no words, no song track list, nothing. Complete emptiness. 

I felt very confused by this and also a little uneasy but at the same time brushed it off by the mystery of the whole thing.

Switching the player on, the scratching noise begins meaning that the vinyl record has started playing.

It started with no instruments, no singing. Just a faint breathing noise. It sounded like a male breathing. Then the audio just stopped.

“Ok that was very weird…” I say out loud this time even more uncomfortable and uneasy. “But it could have just been a creative start or something, like experimental or something.” 

In thought of what is going on, I get interrupted with the next “SONG” beginning to play on the album.

This time, no instruments again, but a noise of screeching. It sounded like a tire screech when someone brakes to hard.

The audio was only about 30 seconds long if just repeating the same audio then it switched to the next “SONG.” 

*track number 3*

This time, I heard a deep growling noise. It was demonic sounding and caused the record player to skip over it. I heard faint words that were hard to understand but I could barely make it out. The words, “due”“die” and “kill.”

Then track number 4 began to play after it cut out the demonic noises.

Track 4 was the sounds of gunshots and people screaming out bloody murder. It sounded like it was footage from a war or something because I heard explosions in the background as well as cries of horror and agony. 

Track 5 began shortly after and was the noise of a little baby giggling which then quickly turned into a cry and then a blood curdling and ear bleeding, scream! 

“AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!”

That stopped and began the next track, track 6. 

This next track was the sound of footsteps stomping around what sounded like leaves, I could hear birds chirping. So this place sounded like it was in the middle of the woods or something like that.

Here comes track 7 as it started to play.

This track was very very very weird. The sound of a woman in water moaning out loud. 

“The fuck is this sick perverted shit!?” I said out.

Track 8 was nothing but the noise of dogs growling and howling but at the end the dogs began to whine and sounded like they were dying. That one got me and I was thinking about turning the player off, but I was too interested to do so. That feeling of knowing that something is morbid and awful but you are still curious and in awe from it that you can’t stop watching or listening to it. That weird, weird… weird feeling.

Track 9 began and was the noise of a laundry machine at full blast. Nothing much on that one. 

“What is the concept of this album!?” I said while chuckling. I know I shouldn’t have laughed, but it was just so weird that I couldn’t help myself but to.

Track 10 began and was the noise of a little girl screaming, her screams muffled. It sounded like she was being kidnapped, poor doll.

This was when I had to turn it off but…

*just one more and than I’m done*

Well track 11 began and was the noise of…

Myself talking. Or it sounded like me at least. It was me. Wait what the fuck!!! What the hell!

The vinyl record than stopped indicating that that track was the last one. 

A total of 11 tracks on the weird and demented album, but I realised, my mailbox slot number is 11.

“What the actual fuck is going on MAN!”

Then I heard knocking at my door. Loud loud knocking!!

Then a loud scream from a man!

“PLEASE, SOMEONE HELP ME! It is after me!!! HELP ME! AHHHHHHH!”

*than silence* 

Peeking out the window from my living room I saw something horrifying.

A dead body of a male, 20 years old. Getting eaten by rats, vultures, and maggots.

I almost threw up by the site of it. The lifeless body laying on my drive way. Being a feeding ground for nature.

“What did he mean by IT though?” I said in confusion and fear.

Than the record player randomly started up again. 

I thought I had taken it out but than just remembered that I hadn’t and just left it in there after hearing the knock on my door.

The record player began playing noise. 

But the sounds of what just happened. The sounds of the knocking on my door and the sounds of the man yelling in pure terror. Than a demonic voice at the end that said, “look out the window!” And then a little snarl at the end! 

Peeking back out the window, I saw red words on the driveway.

It was from the dead man’s blood.

The words spelled out …

“You ripped the album i see, now it’s my turn to rip your insides out.”
