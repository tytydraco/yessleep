We heard a slippery, wet sound outside on the ground, followed by something scraping against the bricks on the wall.

"Tlik. Tlik. Tlik. Tlik."

A thing resembling a head appeared in the window.

I ran to my husband.

"Something's out there, Kevin!"

"What do you mean?" He laughed.

"It didn't have eyes, but I think it saw me."

A loud "Pzit. Pzit. Pzit." crawled around in my consciousness.

We both reeled over in pain. Someone screamed, and our dog Stacy yelped.

"The fuck was that?" moaned Kevin.

The door unlocked as a sickly orange and grey figure slid inside.

"Hello, Mark. I see you've found a wonderful person." The words clawed their way into existence, etching meaning through something that felt like thought.

"Do you believe you would do anything for each other?"

The words mixed incoherently, somehow making sense. They were out of order, jumbling around and echoing each other's meaning. Concepts forced themselves into reality as words.

"I'm going to test that."

Its body changed size.

"Tlik. Tlik."

It changed sizes again, closer.

We fumbled backward.

It 'smiled'.

"Laugh. Laugh. Laugh."

I hid Kevin behind me.

Kevin trembled and grabbed my arm.

I held onto his hand.

"Get the fuck out of our home."

"Protective, are we?"

The air moved as it lifted an appendage toward Kevin.

"Mine."

My body froze.

I couldn't even move my eyes.

Its protuberance shifted "\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" away as it grabbed Kevin.

I was screaming in my head at the thing, watching Kevin disappear out of my peripheral.

"Shut up, or I'll eviscerate him."

Tears rolled down my cheeks.

"That's better."

I fell to the floor, breathing hard.

"You will get him back, but only if you listen."

The ideas of meaning exploded in my head without saying anything.

I could feel people thinking.

"Find them."

"You will know what to do."

I couldn't move.

"Oh yes, you can."

"Pzik. Pzik. Pzik."

I doubled over again.

"Listen, or I'll start destroying memories."

Its presence scratched inside, causing me to scream.

It gouged away my mother's face, lines of deterioration removing context over every recollection. I was clutching my head in my arms.

"Mom!" I breathed out, exhausted. It was causing me to hyperventilate.

"Do it, Mark!" Kevin's voice struck me like words typing into my thoughts. The fabric of his personality expressed himself as an inner monologue in written form.

"There's nothing here. It's empty. It hurts to speak. It hurts to think."

I ran out of the house, feeling my way to the words inside my head.

I found one.

It was a child.

My husband was telling me what to do by proxy of that thing.

I can feel the screams in my hands as it went limp.

The next one was a friend.

I peeled them with a dull knife by Kevin's guidance.

He was crying as he controlled my hand.

The thing was hovering over me.

"Why are you doing this?"

"I was traveling through."

There were two other people.

It's gone. I have Kevin back. We don't know where to go.
