When I was a kid, young, probably around four or six, I would always have trouble getting to bed. I would toss and turn, uncomfortable. I couldn't explain why to my mother why I had always felt like something was wrong whenever I laid down onto my bed, looking at the ceiling in my own cold sweat. Eventually, I would always end up going to my mom and dad's room. My brother would always tease me for it saying that I'm "Too old to be sleeping with your parents," and when I had pissed in their bed one time as a toddler. However that night, I decided to man up, and grow a pair. I was tired of the endless teasing from my brother, and I wanted to prove to him that I wasn't just some crybaby who needs their parents to help them sleep. To be honest, looking back on it now, I should've just ignored my brother entirely, and followed my initial instinct of leaving the room out of fear. 

"Honey, are you sure you wanna sleep in here? Your mom and dad are always okay to let you sleep with us if you feel sad without us." My mom said.

"Mommy, I don't wanna! I wanna sleep in my own bed!" I replied, like a little shit, if I'm going to be honest.

"Well.. okay, just, if you wanna come to mommy and daddy's room, just knock on our door and we'll let you come sleep with us." She said back to me.

I closed the door, with more conviction than a toddler should have, then laid in my bed. I stared at the ceiling, and closed my eyes. My brother wouldn't make fun of me tommorow, I was sure of it.

Later that night. I awoke in a cold sweat. One where my whole body was covered in it. It wasn't like it was hot in the room, infact, it was during the winter, and my mom always kept my window open since the air conditioning hardly reached my room, so, it was fairly cold. 

I tried to ignore the feeling, I really did. I tossed, and I turned, I closed my eyes and counted sheep, turtles, T-Rex, all the animals my toddler brain knew of at the time. I eventually had begun to drift off to sleep. My eyelids grew heavy once again, and I knew it was time. Slowly, my body relaxed, and I was nearly asleep, when,

*SKRUUK*

Something and scraped loudly, something sharp. It sounded metalic, in a way. Nearly like a knife. 

*SKRUUCH*

It happened again. By now, I was already alert. It sounded as if it had come from the attic entrance above me. You see, in this house, all the bedrooms resided on the second floor, with the kitchen and living room downstairs. In two of the bedrooms, my brothers, and mine, were there attic entrances. 

*SKRUUK* 

One more scrape. At the time, I thought I had connected the dots to something so obvious. My brother must be playing a prank on me! It wouldn't have been a new development, he's done a few pranks before, and I'd been humiliated more than enough times by being scared of him.

"Liam! You are playing another prank on me, I know it!" 

I said to the attic entrance above, trying to keep my voice down and not awake my parents.

No response.

"It's not funny Liam! I'm trying to sleep!"

No response.

By now, I was as furious as a toddler could get. First, my brother, Liam bullies me for not being able to sleep without mom and dad, but now, he is trying to scare me into going to their rooms so he can make fun of me? 

"Okay, Liam I'm gonna go up there and beat your butt!" I shouted

No response.

I groaned, then hopped off of my bed. I spent a little bit of time dragging my bed over under the attic entrance, then stood atop my bed, jumped as high as I could, and grabbed the latch to open the attic.

The stairs slid down loudly, I could only hope my mom and dad didn't wake up. If they did, I would've been in big trouble.

I take one peek out of my bedroom door, and no one seemed to be stirring, so I closed it quietly, and hopped up onto the unfurled attic stairway.

In the attic, It was dark. Really dark. So dark I couldn't see my hand infront of me, or anything around me. I have no clue how Liam could've gone through here and found my rooms attic entrance to play his prank in this darkness. 

I could hear the crickets outside, chirping loudly as usual. The wind blowing against the shingles of the roof, the jingle of our windchime by the front door. Our attic wasn't very sound proof.

Now that I'd taken in all of the scenery, or lack thereof, all my previous confidence had gone. I was just a toddler after all, afraid of the dark. I had made my mind up to go back down and try and figure out how to close the attic door when

*SKRUEECH*

The scraping noise. Except now, it sounded like it had a bit more of a.. squelch to it. It sounded more clear now. It was nearby. The thin attic walls weren't soundproof, but they hid the nature of the scraping well. My toddler mind couldn't comprehend what it could have been, but I know now, that it was most likely flesh. 

"L-Liam?" I said. My voice shaky, tears starting to well up in my eyes.

The moment I spoke, the atmosphere changed. The wind was gone. The crickets stopped abruptly, the soothing chimes in the distance had begun to die out in sound. 

I stood on the stairs, frozen in complete fear. I couldn't move at all. This type of fear was too much for a toddler, leaving me only just able to sit there. There was no fight or flight, just freezing. My mind at that moment was probably racing as fast as my heart was.

I could only come to one conclusion. That was not Liam. That was not my brother. 

I couldn't see anything in that pitch black darkness. I think maybe it was for the best. 

My body which was lagging behind my racing mind, finally caught up. 

I went backwards down the stairs as fast as possible, falling down on my side in the process, then quickly getting up and running to my mom and dad's room. I turn the knob, it was locked. 

"MOM! MOM!" I shouted in distress, pounding on the door.

Ten seconds of screaming and slamming on the door later, my mom opens the door.

I run into the room crying my eyes out. I explained everything that happened, and they probably thought I was just raving about something childish, and didn't believe me. 

"You have to believe me! Check the attic, it's there! I heard it!" I exclaimed to my dad.

He got up with a sigh, and said,

"Fine. I'll go check the attic if it'll make you feel better. It's gonna be nothing in it though, so don't get your hopes up." He said exasperated.

At the time, I thought my dad was indestructible. More powerful than Superman, more smart than Batman, and more agile than Spider-Man. So, I followed behind him into my room, and up the attic.

He turned on his phone flashlight, and scanned it around the attic floor. I was sitting on my bed below him, watching him nervously.

"See, nothing he-" He stopped mid sentence. I could see his obvious immediate disturbance.

"Son, you know how to call the police right? Mommy taught you? Call 911 right now on the home line in the kitchen and wake up your brother." He said. This was the most serious I'd ever heard my dad.

"But, dad-" I said, getting cut off

"Now. Go, now." He demanded.

I ran out my room and bursted into my brothers room. 

"Liam, Liam wake up! We need to call 911!" I shouted, jumping onto him, which startled him enough to wake him up immediately.

"What? What do you mean 911, like cops?" Liam said.

"I dunno, daddy just told me to, he seemed really mad!" I said, running downstairs to the kitchen.

Turning on the kitchen light, I dialed 911, on the house phone. I told them about how my dad had told me to call them, and how he seemed really panicked. Due to me being a toddler, I couldn't really convey everything perfectly, but I managed to get the point across well enough that police were on their way to our address. My dad, Liam, and me waited in the kitchen. He wouldn't let us go anywhere upstairs. I was really curious at the time what he had seen in that attic that I hadn't. But my fear of my dad getting angry at me outweighed the want to see whatever was up there.

At the time, I didn't find out what was up there. Shortly after we had moved out of the area, I joined a new school along with my brother, and that was that.

But now, decades later, I had come across an old  article. It was small, short, concise, and only really published in the local area. 

"Man behind the killings of fourty finally caught and sentenced." Was the headline 

I figured it'd be interesting, until I clicked the article and was met with a picture of my home. 

It was said in the article, for years, a killer had used that houses attic to dismember and consume his victims.

His M.O. usually went like this.

He would find the victim, drug them, climb up the large tree that leaned on the attic window, and throw himself along with the victim inside the attic. He would then start, for lack of better word, dismantling them. His victims were alive when he did it. He usually drugged them with something that prevented muscle movement.

The sound I had heard that night was the scraping of flesh off of bone, someone dying. I suppose one reason I wasn't killed might've been because they got some kick out of someone being nearby while they murdered someone.

The more I thought about it, the more I realized what my father saw that night. I can imagine him turning the light on his phone on, waving it around and seeing a glimpse of a shiny, growing pool of blood. Shining the flashlight up, he wouldve found someone, partly bone, partly muscle, partly skin. 

The killer was never found by the police. Some private detective did it. They killed them, though. Probably for the best.

Nobody knows that they looked like, my dad who was one of the only people to catch a glimpse of them just said he could only tell they had average build, average height. 

To this day, my father doesn't speak anymore on the topic of this. I can understand why. If it wasn't for the darkness that night, I would've had to pay a lot in therapy to this day.

Just know. If you hear anything lurking, scraping, scratching in the dark, it could be a prank, it could be mice, but you never know, it might be something far worse than you could ever imagine.
