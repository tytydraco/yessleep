   Somethings outside my room… I don’t know who or what it is. I’ve been staying at my house for the last month and I’ve been hearing noises outside my door. 

   It all started about 2 weeks ago. It was a little past midnight, I was up watching my TV when I checked the time on my phone. I realized how late it was getting and decided to punch out and go to sleep. I turned off my TV and started to drift to sleep when I woke up to a creek as if someone had been putting all their pressure into a loose floorboard. I sat up and looked around my room and saw nothing. Assuming my mind was playing tricks on me I decided to lay back down and tried to hurry to sleep.

   When I closed my eyes I started to plunge into the abyss when I was awakened by another creek. This time it sounded as if someone was walking away. Now almost certain I wasn’t going crazy, I grabbed my bat by my bed stand and headed to the door. Not knowing what I was looking for assuming someone breaking in. I quietly opened my bedroom door and looked down the dark hall which was barely light up by nothing but a pungent yellow street light. Down the hall near the corner, I saw a shadow. Focusing my eyes trying to see what it is barely out of reach of the dim light, I could make out what I believed to be ahead. In a mixture of rage and fear of an intruder, I shouted “Who the hell are you what are you doing in my house.” *BEEEP* a loud car horn from down the road startled me, and I ended up turn my had to face the window out of fear as my body moved on its own.

   Turning back to where the person was I couldn’t make out the silhouette anymore. “Where did they go?” I asked myself. I proceeded to tiptoe down the hall with bat in hand trying to keep my composure. When I reached the corner I clenched the bat tight and jumped around it… There was nothing there what? I just saw them, I slowly reached for the bathroom door nob sweat drenching my palms. I swung it open expecting to catch the perpetrator red-handed, but there was nothing.  I slowly shut the bathroom door and breathed a sigh of relief. *SLAM* “What was that?” I peered around the corner and saw my bedroom door had been shut. Now visibly shaking I crept back to my room opened and scanned it. There was nothing. I ran around my entire house making sure every door and window was locked while checking for someone. Nothing, thinking I was paranoid or just downright insane. I went back to my room crawled into bed and had the worst sleep of my life. When morning came I chalked everything up to it being a wild lucid dream and went to worm.

   2 days later, I had my next interaction with this unknown entity. I was sitting up in bed on my laptop scrolling through Twitter, when I heard a light scratching at my door. Startled I assumed it was my cat trying to get in. I went to let her in but being so caught up I realized my cat had passed away not too long ago. Hand on the door knob I froze sweat dripping down my forehead. I decided to open my door but nothing was there. I decided to call it a night and sleep since I had work in the morning and didn’t need to hear my boss chew out for being late. Suddenly I woke up out of nowhere. I’m a heavy sleeper and I could sleep through a hurricane if given the chance too. I opened my phone and read 1:12 a.m., confused about why I suddenly woke up. I panned the room to be greeted by darkness. Then I heard it *chhhhhh* a loud long scratching noise from the top to bottom of the door was heard. So loud it felt like I had headphones on. After gathering myself from almost shitting my pants, I had a weird wave of nausea hit my head. It was my 20th shot of vodka and I passed out. I woke up in the morning and completely forgot about what happened until I saw the 1-inch thick nail marks along my door. Terrified I took a picture and left in a hurry to work skipping breakfast.

   About a week after that I haven’t had anything happen. While brushing my teeth I heard the creaking again, assuming it was my lard body cause I brushed it off. Then my lights cut out, assuming I forgot to pay the light bill. I hurried to finish brushing my teeth. When I went to open the bathroom door I heard a light knock. In shock, I sat in silence nearly pissing myself. *bang bang bang* the banging kept getting louder. I was in the corner furthest from the door curled up in a ball, waiting for the door to give any moment. The banging got so loud it was ringing in my head like bouncing a ball in an empty cave. What felt like hours was only a minute the banging had abruptly stopped. I sat there for a moment trying to figure out what the hell had happened and gathered my composure. Cautiously I opened the door, but there was no one there. I ran through the house trying to figure out what caused that god-awful banging. There was nothing.

   3 days ago I was after not sleeping for what felt like an eternity it happened again. This time I had what sounded like a dripping faucet outside my room. Then I heard it, a child’s giggle. The giggle sounded painful like it was choking on its mucus or someone trying to get water out of their lungs. The giggling slowly turned into a painful laugh the a cry. The cry was so loud it was painful, I covered my ears to try to stop my head from throbbing. But that didn’t help it was like it was coming from my palms. In tears from my head throbbing it stopped. I sat there in silence out of nowhere a scream so loud it felt like my eardrums ruptured and I ended up passing out like I was hit in the head by a tire rod.

   Yesterday I woke up to what sounded like something dragging itself under my bed. Shuffle around and adjusts itself. I sat there frozen not wanting to alert whatever was there that I was awake. Then I heard the giggle… A chill ran down my spine I grabbed my keys and jumped off my bed. I went to run for the door but something caught my leg. I looked down and a decomposing blueish-tinted arm dripping water was grabbing my pants. Frantically I pulled and tugged and got free I booked it into my car and put it in reverse, but before I pulled away I looked up and saw my blinds being pulled open. Just a few a few inches signifying someone was watching me as I ripped out of my driveway. 

   I'm writing this to you at 2 a.m. from a motel to warn you. If you hear strange noises outside at night you’re night safe. Your fate has already been sealed to be decided by this creature. She is here for me I hear her giggles.
