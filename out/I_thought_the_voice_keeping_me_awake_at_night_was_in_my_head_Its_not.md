For the past week my nights have been terribly wrong and painful. I don't know where to start.. 

It's like.. the air in the room has quite literally turned against me.   
  
It began small, say little whispers that I wrote off as my brain misfiring at the edge of hypnagogic sleep. Everybody's heard those voices once in a while. 

It started as a sound that sort of shaped itself into my name. Like a plea to stay awake, or a confused pronunciation of language. Then I'd feel this slow, creeping, almost freezing chill - like the blanket over me wasn't enough anymore. I felt I was sinking in a bed of ice cold water, my body felt brittle.

The voice - I first thought it was stress or some form of insomnia. Last night proved that what I was hearing wasn't just in my head.

I had just laid down from a tiring day. I shut the lights to my room and kept the door slightly ajar. I slowly began to sink into bed. 

The second my eyelids dropped, a voice slipped in like it had been waiting all this while. It was low, calm, not even trying to be scary.

*"Stay awake",* it said.

Then, almost gently, *"Just... don't look behind you."*

I grew disoriented.

*"Don't... look.... up.",* it followed later, like an intimate whisper in my ear. I shuddered, almost nervously, like a wet voice had spoken in my ear.

I kept my eyes shut, fearing I'd see something if I'd open them. 

*"Open... your.. eyes"* the voice chanted.

*"Open... your.. eyes"*, it demanded.

It repeated the phrase like a mantra.   
  
Curiosity got the better of me and I slowly slid them open, fearing the worst. 

Instead.. I saw nothing.

Nothing... but just a slight curve of something - like the crown of a head, leaning into my field of vision,   
watching me from above. 

Where'd it come from? My heart beat faster.. I froze in place.   
  
I didn't see its whole face, but if I had rolled my eyes upward, it would certainly be visible.

As the realization of something terrible seeping into my room hit me, the lights snapped on - almost blinding me. The curved crown of the dark head was now clearly visible, and I didn't dare to look back to it's face. The figure's frame felt like it was shaking in excitement.

I gulped.   
  
The voice returned, *"Get up... close the lights.."* I heard a slight chuckle as it died from my ears.  
  
I didn't move at first. My body screamed to stay put in bed. But the longer I resisted, the heavier the air got, like it was pressing me into the mattress. 

I finally pushed myself up, not turning, and approached the switch. With every step I took, I heard someone else's footsteps falling exactly in sync with mine, like a second pair of feet shadowing me.

I flicked the lights off, shuffled backwards to bed. The footsteps met mine in a horridly well-placed rhythm.

The second I shut my eyes, it started again. The same game, the lights on. The voice coaxing me up, growing intentfully menacing and cruel each time; Footsteps pacing me in a dance. Over.. and over. I was too scared to look back at the entity (I felt was) following me so closely. I feared it'd snap my neck should I have turned.

*"Get up... (chuckle) .. close the lights.."*  
*"Don't sleep.. kill the lights."*  
*"Kill.... kill.. the.. lights."*  
*"Don't look back, no, don't look back!"*

My eyes were bloodshot, burning raw like they'd bleed out. A curtain of red began to lint above my eyebags.

The game stopped, as if the voice now knew of mercy.

I lay stiff, unable to sleep - willing myself to ignore the slight, growing bulge at the edge of my vision. The shape above me started to change. 

The voice wanted to show me it's face as it slowly creeped into my vision.

A long, sickly dry, gray face in the dark. It's eyes two snow-pale orbs, blinking slowly, almost mechanically in the dark - glowing white like a husky's eyes catching headlights - fixed on me. A mouth stiched painfully shut with what seemed like wire in the dark.

I felt terribly cold. My body spiked so violently I thought my veins would burst. My arms and legs went rigid, my frame locked, and all I could move were my eyes. Fear gnawed at my chest.

I tried looking away, but the cold eyes wanted to meet mine. 

As I grew paralyzed, I began to lose my breath, my skin grew pale as if it was freezing - also cracking into bloody blisters erupting all over. My heart skipped several beats. My jaw grew stiff.

I couldn't physically fight its influence. So I did the only thing I could - stare back.

That's when it *shrieked* \- or better yet, *screamed.* 

It wasn't human - not even animal. The sound was so sharp and layered it felt like it was shredding my nerves. My ears began to bleed, my vision grew red. 

As I forced myself to stare into it's cold eyes - the creature began to coil like a monstrous, darkly tentacled serpent. My bedroom door slammed open as if the scream itself had blown it apart.

The longer I stared, the louder it shrieked. Until, in one impossible flicker, its large, wiry shape shot past me - like a blur of black cold wind, and the door slammed shut again.

Silence followed. My stiff body broke out from its stasis, the blood slowly chugging through my body. I grew warm. My head felt terribly dizzy.

I haven't slept since. My body is begging me to. My head keeps nodding forward, my eyes keep rolling shut - but everytime I feel myself slipping into a daze, I hear it breathe against my ear.
