I'm reading  "HR GIGER ARh+ (Spanish) " book and I tought you guys would aprecciate this personal story that's there. I strongly recommend checking his work if you're not familiar with it already.

I translated this from spanish so probably I made some mistakes.

"A true occult story"

I prefer to tell this story in detail, because, being a fanatic for the truth, I want each of its details to be verifiable. Basically, it is about a question: can an object be evil or not?

Some years ago a friend of mine - the gallerist Bijan Aalam, to whom I owe most of my collection of occult objects - gave me a devil's head. It was made of hollow wood and, according to Bijan, covered with human skin. The neck was finished with a collar of fibrous bark, similar to that found on Chianti bottles. This object came from some Spanish heritage.

There is still nothing clear about the provenance of this head with three curved horns. It is supposed to be about a hundred years old and to have been used as a ritual object in Satanic cults or similar ceremonies. In any case it is clear that it was never used as a mask, as the hole in the neck is too narrow. Possibly it was worn on the head, and the fact that it is hollow had the function of reducing its weight. I cannot give any further details, as I do not have them. I put the head in question on my shelf and forgot about it.

Shortly after, Bijan came to visit me and I told him that I had been suffering from severe depression lately and that I could not explain its origin. Bijan pointed to the Satanic head on the shelf and suggested that it was probably due to its influence; he knew that negative forces were attributed to it. He advised me to put it somewhere in the basement. I followed his instructions, put it in a cardboard box with a couple of other junk, took it to the basement and forgot about it.

I hate being superstitious. I think it is a great weakness that enslaves and can lead one to madness. Superstition can bring about coincidences, that is, one unconsciously makes certain things happen. I make an effort not to be superstitious and I avoid everything that has to do with sects or religious fanaticism.

A couple of years ago, on Friday, March 23, based on a painting from the *Serie Victory*, painting *Nr. 516 V*, we printed a red poster for an advertisement for the magazine "Team" (No. 4, April 1984). It had the title *Satanás* and we printed it in five colors. The fifth color - normally only four are used - was an orange-red which greatly increased the effect of the painting. That day I was returning to Zurich, returning from the I.C. Müller company in Seefeld. I recently had the basement cleaned.

Because the press had done a good job, I looked at the head and thought it would be nice to put it on a pedestal.

In the evening I was invited to an event (Tango Palace) at the Albisgüetli with my ex-wife Mia. My friend and collector W. also wanted to go to the event with his girlfriend B. He suggested that we stop by his house first, and then we all go together. As a present, I brought him a copy that had just come off the press; W. enthusiastically hung it on the wall. Everyone was impressed by the intense red.

B. had put on a beautiful black, transparent dress made of a kind of *Tul de viscosa*, which W. had given her. It was admired by all those who made up that small and exclusive circle of tango fanatics, which Mia had taken care to gather. A sculptor had set up shop in the room, persuading people to allow him to make a plaster cast of their faces, so that he could make a mask out of it. We approached him, and I, in turn, tried to convince B. to let him make a cast of her beautiful face. On some tables that were scattered around the room there were some red candles; B. leaned on one of them. When I heard that the sculptor in question wanted to keep the mask, I thought of telling B. that she'd better drop the matter. But it was too late, she was already in flames. The fire had caught one of the sleeves, and in a moment it spread all over the dress; B. was a human torch. W. was motionless, I took off my jacket and we tried to extinguish the flames, in vain. The victim was writhing on the floor.

The flames were finally put out and we carried her into the shower. Mia had called an ambulance, it arrived, she was wrapped in blankets and carried away like a ghost. Some of the people present had not even noticed the accident. But W. and I lost our party spirit. As soon as I got home I put the damned Satanic head in a plastic bag and took it back to the basement. B. had third-degree burns, a lot of pain and many operations ahead of her.

"Occult History II"

This event is one of the strangest coincidences that have ever happened to me, which in reality seem to be fate. The next “coincidence” happened on June 27, 1988. I was preparing the material to be presented at an event at the St. Gallen City Museum together with Ralf, my assistant. The event was entitled *Simposio de alquimia* (Alchemy Symposium) and had been organized by Urs Tremp and Armando Bertozzi. My task was to fill a display case, more or less 2 meters wide, with many objects, I wanted to mix the banal with the magical.

We had already selected exactly 27 objects, which were on the table waiting to be collected  the next day. The Satanic head – catalogued by Ralf as *Cráneo del diablo No. 22* (Devil’s Skull)  – had not been brought into the light of day since that terrible event four years ago. After making the list, we sat down in the garden. It was about six o’clock in the evening when we heard a loud crash in the neighbouring garden and alarmed voices. We both stood there looking at each other; everything was clear, it was a warning from the Satanic head. So I ran to hide it back in the cellar. Outside a gale started. Ralf immediately went home, because he was afraid that he would get caught in the rain on his motorcycle. I called my mother. Five to seven minutes had passed since the crash when someone knocked loudly on my door. The neighbors told me, frightened, that the plum tree in my garden had slowly fallen towards theirs, landing exactly in the place where they had been sunbathing until just before.

They were beside themselves. I went out with them and checked: the huge tree had been cut down 2 meters above the ground. Somehow, lightning had struck it and severed its trunk. It didn't fall immediately, but got caught in the branches of a tree in the neighbouring garden, and then the wind brought it down. Without those few minutes of delay, the neighbours would have been crushed by the tree.

The next day Tremp came to collect the objects for the exhibition, and I told him about the incident. Nothing he did could convince me to display the satanic object. I had already been warned; our lives and the paintings would have been at stake if we had displayed it, and I did not want to take any chances. Superstition had got the better of me once again. If I have to photograph the spawn of evil for this book, I will do so exclusively in the basement."
