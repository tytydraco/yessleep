In the dream, I watched myself laying in bed. Maybe I was sleeping. I don’t really know. The light coming through the window was bright. Bright like it was in day, but heavy, syrupy. Not the full spectrum light given off from the sun. Darker, like if the earth could give off light. It was night. It didn’t hurt to look at the light despite its intensity. In fact, we wanted more of it. We wanted to open our eyes as wide as we could, turn it up somehow, let as much of the slow pulse of it wash against us, thrum inside me. Molasses, jacuzzi, the bobbing of a buoy. I smiled.

So did the me in the bed. I watched my eyelids flutter open, leaning forward as I woke. I (he?) sat up nose first, like a man in a cartoon smelling a pie. His (my?) tongue  poked out of his mouth like a snake tasting the air, and he gulped down what he tasted.. The electricity of a beating heart detected with new organs. Blood in the water. An echo of the world bouncing back and assimilated. He (We?) looked at me (us) and his smile broadened. I nodded and motioned to the window, and I turned to look.

He looked into the light and his eyes welled. He sighed the way you might if a doctor told you the tests had come back negative and you were going to be ok. You (I) already were (was) ok. I walked over to the window and joined me there, and we shared the good news. The light was everywhere outside. It had no source. It was the source. I was feeling giddy. I slung my arm around my shoulder and kissed the side of my head. It felt like he (I) was my child, and I was showing him (me) something wonderful for the first time. The ocean, fireworks, the stars, the Grand Canyon, an octopus, the stars, a diamond, the stars. 

I told him that I had something wonderful for me, for us. I began leading him out of the room. A look of panic as I turned away from the window, an elastic resistance that got stronger the further I turned. But I shushed him, and the grip on my shoulders was firm and reassuring, and I knew that it would only hurt for a minute, and then it would all be ok forever. It already was ok. He opened the front door to show me the light and to show me to the light, and I led him out of the house to let it immerse me. Like bathing my son for the first time. See how good the warmth feels? How good it feels to be clean? To be safe and to be loved? To look up together at the sky and feel it looking back?

I came awake walking. I felt around for me but I wasn’t there anymore. The grass under my bare feet was damp and had a chill and I looked down at it like I would catch it doing something. But I was the one doing something, I realized. I stopped walking to try to figure out what it was that I was doing, and something bumped into me from behind. My right leg shot out in front of me and I regained a sort of balance. I tottered for a moment in the half lunge and then straightened up. I was awake. I’m awake, I thought.

“Sorry,” from behind in a groggy voice. The person who had said it had done so subconsciously, automatically, like a hiccup.

I turned around to see a half-familiar face. A man in his 40’s, a face I’d always seen bent in a polite smile when I waved to him as he walked his dog past my house during the summers. A half-dozen hellos, some chat about the weather and the dog and my lawn. He was in classic pajamas, blue and white stripes crossing the soft fleece of a loose-fitting button top and a pair of drawstring pants. I wanted to ask him where his nightcap was, but the light from my dream was filling the parts of my head that weren't being actively used.

“That’s ok,” I said. He pursed his lips into the half-smile I knew, and gave a small nod as he stepped to my side and began trudging on. I nodded back and watched him move around me, walking up the incline of the small hill we stood on. I watched him walk forward, moving further above and ahead, silhouetted in the sweet dark glow coming over the peak of the hill. The light was viscid, and I could taste the honey on it. I remembered that the man’s name was Chris, and he lived a block or two away from me in our small suburb. His shape got smaller for a little while, then stayed the same size. I realized that was because I had started walking again. 

“Hey, wait,” I called out. Chris turned his head slightly over his shoulder at the noise but didn’t slow. He looked back up to the crest of the hill and the glow coming from the valley beyond it. Looking at the light was like finding the scratch for an itch, one that went deep enough to stop the burrowing of it. It was what a cat felt when it purred, closing its eyes tight to shut out any stimulus that was not this feeling. I looked down away from the light and my mind jangled convulsively, withdrawal collapsed into a single moment. I held my head down and an unpleasant pressure like a sneeze built in my head. Not in my head but inside, in my brain somewhere inaccessible, somewhere deep I couldn't go. My eyes strained to look up into the glow at the top of my peripheral vision. My head jerked up spastically and I yanked it back down like a man fighting a parade balloon on a windy day. I quickened my step and started trotting after Chris.

His legs appeared before me and I made my way a few paces ahead of him before I turned around and let my head rise. “Hey, Chris,” I said gently, reaching an arm out to touch his shoulder. He didn’t notice me so much as the absence of the light he had been staring at, and grunted. He strafed slowly to the side, trying to move around me like he would a rock that had fallen from the sky into his path. I moved over to stay in front of him, my hand finally making contact with his shoulder and gently slowing his momentum.

“Sorry,” he muttered again.

“Hey Chris? Excuse me? Can you please stop for a second?”

A muted snarl played over his lips as he strained to look around me. I kept one hand on his shoulder, slowing his progress as he pushed up the hill. I waved the other in front of his face and he swatted at it weakly. He moved like a kid trying to stay sleepy as he transferred himself from the couch where he’d dozed off to his bed. He moved like a person drowning who didn’t want to be saved.

“Chris. I just need a second buddy.”

=His eyes focused on me for a moment, then flitted away to cloud over in the light, then focusing again on me.

“Hey Chris, it’s Ken.”

Recognition flashed for a second, submerged beneath the lapping waves. I gave him a small shake and he clawed his way above the water into consciousness.

“Chris, it’s Ken.” He looked at my face and nodded, pulled his lips tight into an unwelcoming smile. “I need to talk to you.” He looked at me like I was a stranger on the street trying to get him to sign a petition.

“Busy now,” he slurred, “I gotta show me.” His annoyance rose with his awareness. “I have to… It needs to see and I…” He trailed off as he looked around, looked at me, looked into nothnig. He grimaced like a migraine had stormed suddenly into his head, and began moving with purpose. “This is a bad time,” he said, his voice going perfunctory and businesslike. “Good seeing you, Ken.” He reached up, grabbed my wrist firmly, and pushed it down.

“Just wait a second,” I repeated again and again, climbing the hill backwards to stay in front of him as he dodged and strode with rising intensity. 

“I really need to leave.” He looked more and more desperate. “You need to get out of my way.” I was trying to block his vision of the light, trying to slow him down and maybe get him to turn away. Alarm was rising on his face as he darted his head away from my hands. Strength was returninig to him and we approached violence as we slapped and grabbed at each other.

I thought of a person searching for a pocket of air under ice and I didn’t know if I was thinking of Chris or myself. As we stumbled together up the hill, the ambient light increased and more bled into the edges of my vision. More reflected off of Chris’ face, and as my hands fumbled out at him I didn’t know if I was trying to stop him or reaching for the light.

Animal panic on his face from being cut off from what he craved, from the fear he saw my face, taking it in through eyes covered with a protective sheen but not fully blind, from not knowing what he was doing. “Fuck out of my way,” he said sternly, a final warning. He grabbed one of my wrists, bent it into my chest, and pushed hard. I stumbled back, my heel catching on a lump of grass or a mound of dirt, then falling a short way until the slope of the hill met my body.

Chris paused and looked down at me, surprised at the burst of motion. 

“I’m sorry, Ken.” 

He was already moving again, raising his eyes up from my body as he passed by me. “I have to go. We need this.” His body relaxed as he turned his face up again at the light. His hands dropped to his sides gently and his shoulders untensed and they rolled back. His head moved rhythmically side to side as the muscles in his neck relaxed and he slowed from the brisk stride he had overtaken me with into a gentle amble. All I could see in his eyes as he passed me was the beautiful joyless light, headlights pouring dark.

I rolled over on my stomach as he continued up the hill. We were only about 50 yards from the top. The light now bled over the edge and dribbled down the hill, like floodwaters breaching their banks. Like a prismatic mudslide, like being buried alive and living the rest of your life there in heaven. Like a bug in amber, perfectly preserved, perfectly content. I began to calm. Maybe I had overreacted with Chris. He wasn’t hurting anyone. And he was so happy once he was moving again. He was rising like the light, like the feeling that I felt building in me, and building around me.

Around me, figures swayed up the hill more than they walked, like leaves drifting up instead of down. I realized that these were other people. It sent a shock through me, and I snapped my head around wildly, terror for the first time appearing undisguised in my mind, creeping dread realized and solidified. Dozens of people around me, none aware of me or each other or of being unaware. Their faces were placid masks that would occasionally shudder, sleepers having a nightmare. 

I turned back down the hill where more and more people, hundreds maybe, faded into the darkness at the foot of the hill. Most were dressed for bed, in nightgowns and underwear down to nothing at all. Beyond the bottom of the hill was a gulf of darkness, unlit by either the ghost light coming from over the hill or the light of the city a few miles distant. 

Most of what I could see of the city was the outlines of buildings, but a few streets lay open under the streetlights. The streets thronged with people, milling and packed so tightly they seemed a solid mass. It moved like many as one, bobbing gently like boats on a calm sea, and they poured out from the streets of the city into the lake of darkness that separated them from the hill. That dark space felt empty before but now filled with sinister frothing. It roiled with bodies, churning drowsily in unconscious motion, bugs under a crowded rock. Like looking down at a deep ocean, life in ceaseless senseless agitation under the opaque surface.

I fought to shut my eyes while my body wrenched them open, the urge irresistible, the opposite of a sneeze. The light was on all sides of me, filling up my eyes like a pool, drowning me in a sweet nyquil nod. I looked back up the hill. People stepped around me as they climbed, barely making noise as they swished gently through the grass. Most were in bare feet, some in socks, a few slippers. They marched past in various states of undress, an army of irregulars under a banner of stars. The light shone and bounced in every direction off the curved mirrors of bare skin, like misshapen angels looming and retreating in the negative light.

I watched Chris reach the summit and pause. He spread his arms over his head in rapture. His shadow sploshed over the hillside, projected up onto the sky, but the light was no less intense for it. I felt tears stream over my smiling lips. I had lifted myself up to my knees, my attempts to fight off the pull of the light getting weaker. I  wasbleeding out and beginning to accept it.

“What is it?” I screamed up at Chris.

He kept his arms raised and turned around to us all. He looked like a prophet or a conqueror who had come to lead us, drag us into paradise. He beamed down on us with mercy, or maybe pity. The light shone around him with such ferocity it seemed like it would consume him, would burn him up or absorb him like quicksand, constrict him in an endless open void. 

He pointed down into the valley behind him, then swept his arm over us all. The shadow he projected was charged with the light, and the ground sparkled as though the stars had fallen to earth, or maybe they had been harpooned and pinned. He refracted the like a prism to each of us individually and all of us together. A feeling like a moan ran through us all, an ache like a shiver like a shudder like a thrill. We were a family seeing our new baby for the first time, and a surge of love and fear and jealousy and generosity united and animated us. We were here to celebrate it, to protect it with our love and our hate and our gentle supervision could turn vicious if that’s what was needed. We were here to shape it and to let it shape us. This was all we had ever wanted. It was the whole point, finally there after years of waiting and doubting.

I looked at Chris, and he told me to tell you. He withheld the light from me for as long as it took for me to take my phone from my pocket and post this. He knows you want to come with us, and we're letting you.

Soon, Chris will turn around and disappear over the rise. I'll stand up and go with him, and I'll see what's on the other side.
