I’m typing this up because I need someone—*anyone,* really—to tell me I’m not insane. I smelled something coming from my basement a few days ago and followed it. Now I don’t know what to do anymore.



My nightly routine is always the same. I toss my work clothes, soaked in ten hours’ worth of pipe grime, into the washing machine. 

Then I sit and listen to the water hissing through the faucet—*wait, is there a faucet in the washing machine?* I’ve never really checked. My machines are definitely pre-Y2K; they’re still shiny in spots—but a greasy shine. Like mayonnaise you leave out in the open too long. 



If I close my eyes, I can almost imagine a waterfall. A kind of gray, murky waterfall filled with chemical runoff and other people’s shit. It’s different from what I pictured with my parent’s machine.

The basement of my childhood home was my kingdom. A whole floor of the house just for me and my family’s bountiful laundry schedule. Our machines paid their keep. By the time I was eleven, I did too. 

Every evening, I played in-between loads while I listened to them hum and bang and maybe scrape if change had been forgotten in a pocket.



Now, I don’t always have the luxury to sit and listen to the autonomous chore. Adulthood streamlining has taught me a very important lesson: I don’t have time for laundry—and I don’t make laundry if I avoid wearing clothes at home.

After my naked dinner, I take a shower and collapse into bed for the cycle to begin the next day.

Since I moved out of my parents' house, I’ve had the same languid urge to listen to the washing machine fill. It’s an urge I’ve never had any reason to ignore. Until that night.



You know how people talk about having a “gut feeling” that something is off, like if a relative or spouse gets hurt? There’s some ethereal connection between the two people, some binding force that seems more like twin telepathy than gut feeling. I’m uneasy just thinking about it. 



How do you get that feeling with a house?



\---



I was walking up the concrete path that connects my garage and house. It was pretty late, maybe eight at night. The sky was a little overcast and the wind had the kind of nip that makes it feel like November in April. My *house*, though. 

The closer I got, the bigger it felt. I’m not saying it was looming over me like a funhouse mirror or anything. I guess the reality of how huge it was compared to me really sunk in, then.

Feeling two inches tall was one thing, but the way the air rushed out when I cracked the back door… 

I like to keep diffusers plugged in everywhere. I don’t have any pets so the only ones the fragrances can hurt are me and the bugs I share board with. 

This month, I went with “Laundry Linen.” Boring, sure, but you can’t beat the classics. 



There was no familiar smell that met my tired nostrils. No comforting images of white sheets dancing in the wind to soothe my mind. Just this oppressive, burnt plastic smell that seemed to cling to me as soon as I walked in. It made my mouth dry up, leaving my tongue to fend for itself in the sticky pink prison.

The air seemed to thicken as I moved deeper inside. I was gagging by the time I walked the twenty or so paces across my house, opening every window in my path, audibly begging the chilly spring air to cleanse the stench. 



The smell concentrated the closer I got to the basement. The air between me and the chipped white door got deeper and deeper as I walked. 

It felt like I was being dragged toward it—just not in the yummy pie-in-window way. Man, it felt like it was actually moving *away* from me. Towing me along the linoleum like a tugboat. 

The space was warmer, too. Almost like a sauna whose steam was twinged with old tires and grease stains. By then, I was convinced that there had been a fire down there. Something contained and small, but potent enough to stink up my whole place. 

I got to the door faster than I expected. 

Before I could even question the logic behind that thought, I stretched my arm out.



I recoiled when I touched the doorknob. I had to tap it a few times with rigid fingers before my brain accepted that the burning feeling wasn’t anything dangerous—or hot. It was *freezing*. A thin layer of condensation gilded the lightweight metal, smeared in places by my frantic probes.

After a second of dumbfounded silence I yanked the door open, ready to see orange and yellow dancing somewhere within. 



I had what an ex-girlfriend of mine described as a “spooky basement.” Unfinished, concrete floors and exposed wood beam ceilings. A narrow crawl space opened up directly in front of the stairs, like a black maw that normally suffused the whole basement with an earthy smell.



The only thing I saw when I flipped the light on was the pale white of my painted brick walls, crowned by that menacing rectangular cavity. The rickety stairs made me uneasy on a good day. Untreated wood as old as myself, jammed in place with no backing to prevent them from sliding out of place. 

As I tiptoed they seemed to squeak louder than I remembered. Maybe I just normally tuned it out.

With each step, the space felt more rotten. It was like I was walking into a mausoleum that was definitely filled with skeletons and ghosts. 

I pictured a creature in the crawlspace. Its sharp teeth glinted a greenish-yellow below red, menacing eyes that could see in the dark. It would climb out of the crawlspace when I was distracted with my ritual and eat me in many more than one bite.

I chuckled a little at the childish daydream, half expecting the thing to jump out at me.



*Shuffle*



About halfway down the stairs I paused—the warped step taking the opportunity to let out a long groan. My ears perked, tightening my temples as the hair on my body stood at attention. 

I heard something. A shuffle of feet or a box sliding against the rough concrete floor?

I stood that way for a minute before a breeze from the open windows upstairs caressed the back of my head. I remembered that the space behind the stairs was open and gooseflesh erupted all over me. Suddenly feeling very exposed, I rushed the last half of my descent.

The image of curled wiring and scorched insulation was overwhelming by the time I got to the bottom of the stairs. My nose burned and my tongue felt like wet plaster. The only sounds in the house were me, myself and I. 

Me, breathing. Myself, pissing. And I—want to go home. 



Except this is home. Fuck.



It fully *hit* home as I stood in the basement under the bare yellow lightbulb, smelling whatever stench was making *its* home in my olfactory system. 

Something was wrong. 

Not a normal kind of wrong, like I forgot to move a clean load of laundry to the dryer and would have to run it again to get rid of the mildew twang. My skin prickled, every inch of me alive with a sensation I couldn’t name. There was something behind me, in front of me—something watching. 

The silence grew deeper, heavier, as if the house itself were holding its breath, waiting for something to happen. It wasn’t alone.

My heart thumped like a war drum as my mind raced to uncover the alien feeling. It was something I shouldn’t have to experience in the twenty-first century. 

My hands closed into sweaty fists, almost like I could fight the thought as it hit me—I was being *hunted*.



Why was I in the basement, anyway? 



At the very least, I should have called the emergency number. Gotten a professional to traipse into my dungeon, instead of little old me. 

I stood at the foot of the stairs, looking between the black hole of the crawlspace and my grimy washing machine, weighing my chances in case the monster decided now was a good time to get me. 

The logical side of my mind fully quieted as a pressure rested on my body. It came on like a cold sweat.  

My clothes started to feel heavy all around me, weighing me down like I had been pushed into a pool. The change was sudden enough—*heavy* enough—that I started to strip out of sheer panic. 

I kicked off my boots and peeled up my sweatshirt, then yanked my work pants down. I was gasping a little by then, my whole body taut like a bowstring. The air had settled somewhere within me, exposure numbing the unnatural flavor it carried.

I stood there in the dim light, pants around my ankles and sucking in the heavy environment when I heard it again. Barely perceptible, to my right—where the washing machine lives. I felt like a rodent, all heartbeats and adrenaline.

I waited, silent and still. My gaze pinned on the dull, glinting machine as electricity coursed through me. 

I sniffed my nose—*no way.* 

Another sniff. 

I felt a stupid grin forming on my face as the realization and relief hit me in tandem.



*Laundry Linen*.



I shook my head, the adrenaline crashing around me like shattering plates. My jittery fingers ran along my scalp as a laugh escaped my throat, breathy and grateful.

Feeling crazy is one thing, but I was acting crazy. *I think I worked too hard today.*

I waved away the imagined monster and ignored the crawlspace with a concerted effort. The melting plastic smell was gone, and I wasn’t sure I didn’t completely make up what happened.

The heaviness that had suffocated me just moments earlier lifted. I rolled the tension from my shoulders and stooped to grab my discarded uniform, still half-conscious of the open space behind me.

I undressed fully and stepped up to the machine, letting my muscle memory take the lead.

I stood there, listening to the water rushing into the basin, my breath still clipping through a post-panic haze.

Then I heard it. 

Close. *Loud.*

I didn’t imagine it. 

I had tried to rationalize too quickly.



*Shuffle, Bu-gung!*



I need some time to sort through my thoughts. If I don’t post again… check the crawlspace.
