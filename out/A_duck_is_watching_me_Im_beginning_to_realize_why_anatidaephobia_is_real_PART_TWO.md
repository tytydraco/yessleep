**It's here.**

I don't know how, or why, or anything... but it's here. The duck that's been haunting me for months has made it into my home.

Thanks for all the support on my last post. I'm going through a really tough time right now, with a demon duck stalking me and eating the only person who cared for me. You guys have been an outlet for me, and I'm so grateful for that. I've decided to keep you all updated on everything. I need someone to talk to, and right now, you're all I've got. Well, mostly.

Sorry for taking so long to update. You know, it’s hard to be consistent when you have a murderous, flesh-eating duck looming over you all the time.

To recap: A duck has been following me around for months, and, a while ago, it ate my boyfriend. I moved away, and shortly after, it showed up in the window of my new rental house.  The last development, and the most horrifying, is the duck crap I found in my bathtub.

When I saw it, I basically froze. I was petrified. In the moment, I wondered if it *knew* what it was doing to me, how it was toying with my mind. How could a duck know that, though? I don't know.  I just *felt* it.

The sickening feeling in my stomach compelled me to cry. I did cry, for a long time. I knew the duck was watching me, somewhere, somehow. But I didn't care.  It's a feeling you get used to, but it isn't a good one.

I just want my life back. I want my boyfriend back. I miss him so much.

Anyways. I figure since I'll be updating you guys, I'll tell you a bit about myself. My name is Joanna Summers. I'm twenty-two years old. I dropped out of college and moved out at twenty, because I wanted to make a life for myself. My parents hated me for it, and we haven't talked in years. Until recently, I worked night shifts at a local cafe, that is, until I moved. My boyfriend, Jackson, and I were planning on getting engaged pretty soon, but... yeah. Right now. I'm unemployed, and barely keeping my new home. My parents probably hate me, but they still send me a check every month. I guess they couldn't stand the thought of me being completely desperate. I do appreciate them, really. I just don't have a relationship with them anymore. I don't have a relationship with anyone, except for...

a MURDEROUS DUCK.

I'll stop rambling. I want to try and tell you about what's been going on.

After the duck poop thing, I was in shambles. Any comfort I had was gone after that. I wanted more than anything to be held by Jackson, or just to see a face I knew. I sat in the bathroom floor and cried for I don't know how long. I lost it. I must've been in there for an hour, maybe two, before any rationality came back to me.

At that point, I had an intense drive to find the darn demon of a duck. I practically tore the house apart in an attempt to find it. But I didn't. I couldn't find it.

So I took some mental time, and I read your comments online. A few of your suggestions were interesting, so I attempted a few. I looked into getting Aflac, but that fell through. I couldn't afford it, plus it was hard enough trying to contact someone. Not to mention, how would I explain why I needed it in the first place? 'Oh, a murderous duck is chasing me, so I need insurance.' Yeah, not super believable. Then, I bought a retractable baton off of e-bay. Good for distance, and I could see how tough this duck really was. The only problem is, it didn’t arrive for a few days. I do have some pretty big knives, though. I made sure to grab one of those from the kitchen.

I found myself at a crossroads. I couldn't call any family or friends - they'd think me insane. Who would blame them? It's not every day you're stalked by a flesh-eating bird. I couldn't expect the police to believe me either. I'd already tried animal control, they didn't pick up. Apparently I didn't have great service. I planned on calling them later. Still, I had no idea where this duck was, or how to tell them what was so urgent. There's no way they'd understand.

I was so scared.

To get my mind off of things, I turned on the T.V. in my house. If anything could get my mind off of the fact that a duck was haunting me, it was some *real* news. I turned on the news channel and laid back on my sofa. Mostly it was just about Queen Elizabeth's death, and how Charles was holding up. It was a bit boring, but it comforted me. Normalcy comforted me.

But it didn’t take long for that normalcy to go away. I was distracted by the sound of shuffling coming from near my bed. The one place I HADN’T checked was under my bed. Immediately, my heart started thumping so loud that it almost drowned out the other noise.

I didn’t know if I had the strength to look. But I was trying to muster it up. The shuffling went on for a while, and with every moment it bugged me more and more. I didn’t know how it did progressed like it did, but after a few minutes, it became so unbearable that it was all I could think about.

In a rash decision, I stormed off of the sofa, clicked the mute button, and threw the remote on the ground. I ran to my bed, and sure enough, the sound was coming from there. “Dang it.” I said. Then I realized something - the shuffling had stopped. This was when I really started to be terrified. After deafening silence in which I held my breath to listen, I became furious. “WHERE ARE YOU!?” I shouted, and began to cry when my breath ran out.

Wiping the tears from my eyes, I bent down. I braced myself for what I might see. But I didn't see anything. Well, there were some shoes under the bed, and some eerie cobwebs, but cobwebs were the *least* of my concerns.

Then, I heard a quack. 

Everything in me wanted to run - but I didn't. I froze in place, staring under the bed, not daring to move my eyes, for fear of seeing *it*. My fears were confirmed at that moment, but it didn't end there. As if taunting me, I felt it nibble my foot. I crouched in that position for a good 15 minutes, shaking and petrified, before I allowed myself to move. When I looked behind me, the duck was gone. What was in its place was much worse.

When I saw it, I immediately broke down in tears. A bracelet.

Jackson's bracelet.

It was one I had gotten him for his birthday last year. He hadn't let a day go by where he didn't wear it. Many things crossed my mind when I saw it lying on the floor of my rental house, covered in blood. Among them was the thought, *how the heck did it get that bracelet?* I was almost sure Jackson had been buried by that time - he hadn't wanted to be cremated, that I knew. He told me he was to pretty to be burned. If only he'd have seen himself after the duck tore him...

I never really figured out how the duck got Jackson's bracelet. I suppose it could've yanked it off that day it ate Jackson alive... but then again, I hadn't paid much attention to what he was wearing, instead I had paid attention to what he was *not* wearing - some patches of skin. 

Regardless of how it got my love's bracelet, it brought it into my house, and that was what terrified me. I knew that it had gotten in somehow, but I wasn't about to figure out how a stupid duck could defy the laws of... well, *everything*. 

Warily, I picked up the trinket, flinching at its cold touch on my fingers. I felt as if it was an act of terror to touch the thing, but part of me didn't care. I took it to the sink to rinse off the blood, but it still was stained when I was done.

As I left the bathroom, I caught a glimpse of something white in my mirror.

My heart was racing, but part of me shrugged off the idea as paranoia. I knew the duck was here, but I could've easily been seeing things, right?

Deep down I knew that was wrong.

The rest of that day was relatively normal - with the exception of me crying every 30 minutes and feeling like my life was reduced to nothing. It's not a good feeling. 

That night I went to bed, but for obvious reasons, I couldn't easily sleep. I remember thinking:

I need to stop this. I need to get out of this.

I thought that enough times to drift into a sleep that was uncomfortable, but satisfactory.

Then, I had a dream.

I dreamed I was in a library with thousands of books. I wasn’t in control of my body - it was like watching myself from the outside. Anyway, in the dream I grabbed a book from seemingly out of nowhere. It looked like one of those ancient documentaries of old, long gone species. It’s pages were worn and yellow, some torn, and there were stains all over the contents. The drawings inside wire sketches of species I chalked up to be some kinds of primal forms of animals that exist today - some resembled big cats, dogs, or even birds.

*That’s* when I saw it.

I turned the page, and there it was, just in front of me, almost like it was staring at me from the page. A perfect rendition.

It was the duck. *The* duck.

And just like that, I woke up.

That’s when I made the realization - I needed to research. I had to find out if there was *anything* out there about murderous, flesh-eating, stalker ducks. Yeah, it’s a stretch, but I’ve seen weirder things, and I’m guessing you have too, since you’re on Reddit.

Anyhow, I got on the hunt. I googled, yahood, binged, and pretty much used every available search engine looking for some kind of explanation. Not to my surprise, I couldn’t really find anything plausible. Then, it hit me.

I didn’t need to find information on absurd ducks - I just needed to know about ducks. Just *ducks.*

I’m sure it sounds silly, trying to look to the basics to find a solution, but what else could I have done? Not to mention, it *was* a duck after all. If anything could explain it’s behavior, it would be science. 

After a while of searching, I came across [this](https://artisanfarmers.org/aggressive-duck-behavior/) article. Obviously it’s not a perfect representation, but I decided asserting my dominance was what I needed to do. Funnily enough, the solution was something one of you suggested all that time ago.

I realized it was the time to fight fire with fire.

It was the time to get a duck.

**It’s here.**
