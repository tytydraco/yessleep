It wasn’t guilt. Not really.

I kept telling myself that every time I visited the spot.

A few weeks had passed since I first stumbled onto the hatch. Since I ran like hell from something I couldn’t explain. Since I left my camera behind – the only proof of what I saw.

And yet, I kept going back. Not inside, just close enough to check whether someone else had found it.

And one day, someone had. It was open wider than before – not just ajar. Fresh boot prints in the grass, layered over my old ones. Someone else had been there.

I told my friend Leo – the guy who first told me about the place. Actually, I told him everything. From the moment I set foot in the facility to the exact second I ran for my life. And I shouldn’t have.

He was already hooked the moment I described it. Although he didn’t believe me, he wanted to see what I saw with his own two eyes. He couldn’t stop asking questions about it, and I kept ignoring him and telling him to drop it.

When I told him about the fresh boot prints, he gave me a look like I’d just invited him to a treasure hunt. “I mean, don’t you feel like you left something behind? Think about the camera, the footage on it…” He was right. I had been thinking about it, even though I told myself I wanted to forget.

“Look, even if you’re scared, I’m going there this weekend.” What a fucking asshole, right? He knew I wouldn’t let him go alone. If something happened, I’d carry that for the rest of my life.

I didn’t want to go back. I just… couldn’t let him go alone. I knew what it looks like from the inside. I knew the creature wasn’t aggressive – not last time. Maybe if we moved carefully, stayed quiet… we could grab my camera and leave. A quick, 5-minute adventure.

I didn’t *want* to go back. I *had* to.

That’s what I told myself anyway.

We packed some food and water – in case we needed to distract it, though I doubted that would work – and drove straight toward the place of my nightmares. I entertained the thought of bringing it a gift – maybe wine – but decided against it.

Leo was practically buzzing with excitement the entire drive. He had way too much energy for someone about to step into an abandoned relic possibly haunted by something that should not exist.

Me? I barely said a word. I just kept watching the treeline blur past the window and hoped I wouldn’t regret this more than I already did.

We parked at the same spot I had weeks ago. The trail hadn’t changed. The crash of waves, the howl of the wind—it all felt like déjà vu in the worst way. I froze until Leo’s enthusiasm shook me out of it.

“Man, this place really is something,” Leo whispered, crouching by the boot prints like a detective. “So, these were the new prints you were talking about?”

“Yeah, they’re a couple days old now” I muttered.

“This is insane,” he said, overly joyous. “It’s real. Seems like my sources are to be trusted.”

I didn’t reply, my eyes scanning every detail near the hatch.

He turned toward me with an eager grin. “You ready?”

I looked at him, then back at the hole. I felt my stomach drop. I swallowed hard and adjusted my pack.

“No,” I said. “Let’s go.”

Leo went first. He insisted – “For the camera!” he said, half-joking, half-firm. His boots clanged against the bottom of the elevator.

“Remember,” I whispered, softly dropping down into the elevator as well. “We go inside, get the camera, and leave. Nothing else.”

“Arthur, chill, it’s going to be fi-” The elevator groaned to life as I pressed the “DOWN” button – something I thought I’d never do again. The descent was silent, except for the unavoidable noises of the machinery clanking beneath us.

It stopped, and with it, my breathing did too. I felt a cold chill in the air, like last time.

The doors opened to the same long corridor I remembered – tight hallways, concrete walls, pipes running along the edges like arteries. But something was different. The air was denser, tighter, and a low, pulsing hum vibrated through the floor. It felt like the facility wasn’t exactly *dead* anymore. Like it had been switched on since my last visit – or *because* of it.

We stepped into the water – was it higher this time around? Or was I just imagining things? It almost reached our shins, which I couldn’t help but notice. We both reached for our flashlights, turning them on in sync.

“Leo, get behind me” I ordered, in a whispered tone. “I know where to go, don’t go off wandering around.”

We moved slowly, the soft splashing of the water disturbing the silence between us. We reached the reception and I couldn’t dare look back at the sheets of papers. Although Leo was curious, he didn’t want to fall behind.

It didn’t feel like returning. It felt like *intruding*.

Some of the doors I’d passed by last time were now slightly open. Not fully – just enough to suggest something had come through. I saw Leo wanting to explore, but I signaled him to stay behind me and not to go off on his own. Begrudgingly, he listened.

Apart from the doors, everything was the same shape, the same layout I remembered – but none of it felt the same. The air had weight now, like the walls had exhaled after holding their breath for too long. The facility was no longer asleep – it was *awake*.

Leo kept following behind me, humming under his breath like we were walking into an abandoned mall and not the kind of place that left a taste like panic in the back of my throat.

We finally arrived at the hallway that sloped downward. Last time, there’d been double doors at the bottom. Now? Just a jagged hole in the wall, wide enough to walk through. The sound of moving water echoed through the facility – not caused by our walking, but by something else inside.

Leo didn’t stop.

“Wait. This is where it was. Where I saw it last time. Let’s be careful and stick to the plan.”

Leo nodded, and we stepped through the hole.

There I was. Back in the large chamber, a cold chill running down my spine. I looked around frantically, trying to find my camera and avoid the ship as much as I could. But Leo had other priorities.

“Okay, this is… actually insane.” He said, then took a few steps forward as I was still surveying the floor.

My boots splashed in the water, then I finally saw it. My camera.

I jogged over and crouched down. The casing was cracked. I flicked the power switch, just out of instinct – nothing. Completely dead.

“Hope the SD card’s still good. That’s all I need,” I whispered under my breath, then tucked it away in my backpack.

Leo, unfortunately, found the vessel but didn’t approach it – just swept his flashlight over it like he was scared it might move if he got too close.

“C’mon man, I found the camera. Let’s get out of here and I can show you everything.”

“You weren’t kidding about this place.” His voice was quieter now. Less awe and excitement and more unease.

“I know,” I said, standing up slowly. “You good?”

He hesitated. Then: “You remember the boot prints?” he asked, not meeting my eyes. “The ones you saw outside the hatch.”

“What about them?” I asked cautiously.

“I made them,” he blurted out. “I didn’t go in, I swear. I just wanted to grab your attention. You weren’t going to come back and I thought-”

“You *faked* it?” My voice was low, but sharp with a hint of disappointment. “You manipulated the scene – *just* so I’d come back?”

Leo flinched. “I-I’m sorry, but… but come on. You haven’t stopped thinking about it.”

I stared deep into his eyes, trying to hold my voice back.

“You were obsessed, Arthur. You still are. You couldn’t stop talking about this place. I had to see it for myself.”

I took a step forward him. “You don’t get it. This isn’t just an old facility. There’s something wrong down here.”

He looked away. I saw shame on his face. “I had to see it. And I knew you wouldn’t come unless someone gave you a reason.”

I didn’t have time to respond. Something answered for me.

**It’s here.**

A soft splash. Not ours. We both went rigid.

Another splash, slower. Deliberate. This wasn’t just an object or something floating. It was moving towards us. It was coming from the far end of the dry dock.

Leo whispered, “What the hell is that?”

I already knew.

My pulse slammed against my ears. From the shadows, something shifted. A slim, tall silhouette, approaching through the water. It was no longer idle. It was moving. Searching.

I leaned in, whispering. “Back out. Slowly.”

We both began stepping backward through the water, careful not to splash.

The silhouette moved again – not fast, but purposeful. Every step it took seemed to echo through the chamber.

We reached the edge of the room. I could see the doorway we came through.

But we both made the same mistake: we looked away.

When we turned back, it was gone. My breath caught in my throat. I held up my hand, signaling Leo to stay still. He didn’t listen.

“Where did it-”

The we heard it.

*Splash.*

From behind us.

I spun around, scared of what I was about to see.

There, silhouetted in the corridor, just between us and the way out. It stood still, head tilted slightly, as if studying us.

It didn’t charge. It didn’t speak. It just waited, like when I first visited.

Leo’s breathing was shallow. His light trembled in his grip.

A sudden twitch in its shoulder. Then the arm moved – not fast, but like it had just remembered it could.

“We can’t stay here,” Leo muttered. “Arthur, we-”

Then it lunged.

A sudden lunge that was aimed at the space between us. It wanted to separate us.

I looked up at it. The creature was twice my size, its eyes fixed on Leo.

“Run!” I yelled, not knowing what else we could do in that situation.

Leo bolted left, toward the other end of the chamber. I went right, toward the small surveillance chamber and beyond it.

Behind me, I heard water crashing. Then Leo yelling my name. Then a metallic sound like something *big* fell down.

Then nothing.

I didn’t stop. My flashlight beam bounced off walls as I turned sharp corners, slipping in the water. My backpack hit the doorframe as I kicked a door open and burst into a room – metal shelves, papers strewn across the floor, overturned chairs.

And beyond them – monitors. Dozens of them. Still on and flickering.

The hum I’d felt earlier? It was louder here. Coming from this room.

I slammed the door shut behind me.

I let out a breath that I’d been holding in for the last minute of running.

My light caught on a corkboard plastered with papers. Diagrams. Anatomical sketches that didn’t look fully human. Logs with dates stretching back to the seventies. Each marked VESSEL-DWELLER.

My flashlight dimmed as I stepped closer. There were official orders, handwritten notes, small post-its, drawings – everything you can imagine.

I stared at the words until they burned themselves into the back of my mind.

There were binders stacked under the shelves. Some sealed. Some opened and warped by time, but still readable. The computers hummed, screens blinking with old interface windows, asking for login credentials I didn’t have.

I took off my bag and slumped it against the wall. My breathing finally slowed. I think I was safe here. Locked in, but safe.

Whatever this place was – whoever built it – they knew what they were doing.

I don’t know what happened to Leo. Maybe he got out through a vent. Maybe he… maybe he didn’t.

But I’m not leaving. Not yet.

I’ve got food and water. I’ve got shelter. And I’ve got days – maybe weeks – worth of documentation in this room alone.

So I’m going to stay.

I’m reading every goddamn page in here. Every note. Every entry. Every name scratched out and scribbled over. Every tiny bit of detail I can find out about this place, and the creature it holds.

Maybe Leo was right. I really *am* obsessed.

When I’m done, I’ll come back. I’ll tell you everything. I’ll bring it all to light.
