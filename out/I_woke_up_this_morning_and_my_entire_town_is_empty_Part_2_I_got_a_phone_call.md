Last night after the break-in and my escape, for some reason I found out that when I went to respond to people on my first post, I, for some reason cannot type using letters when I try to respond to people. So if I reply to anyone’s post it’ll be in numbers, at least until I can somehow fix the problem. Each number corresponds with one from the alphabet.  

This morning, I woke up in my car. It was cold, and I could still feel the goosebumps I had from last night, whether it was from the cold, or my fear of that old woman, was unknown to me. I tried to think about what was going on, why was that old woman trying to kill me? Who is she? I was reading through the responses on my last post, someone suggested I go to Walmart and get a ‘survival guide.’ I’m still debating on whether or not it is safer to live outside as opposed to inside. Unfortunately, I realized that I could not go back to my house anymore, I’d be unsafe there, that old woman knows where I live now. 

I had no real plan and as I set my plans on Walmart, I kept thinking about what the old woman said. “We want blood.” Who is we? I kind of shrugged it off and tried not to think about it. All I could hope was that someone would come into town and find me, I just wish I didn’t feel so alone. As I drove to Walmart, I passed by the movie theater, it was very rundown and the owners never took care of it. But I noticed something as I passed by and it made me slow the car down. Written, in what I can only assume was blood, was the words: Crave Crave Crave. I had no idea if it was that crazy old woman who wrote that or what, but I didn’t intend on finding out. 

I drove into the deserted Walmart parking lot. It’s funny, normally I could never find parking here, but now I had all the parking I could want. I left my car and walked inside the store. The store surprisingly was not quiet as I thought. A Springsteen song was playing over the loudspeaker. There was an eerie feeling, not being able to hear people speaking to their families or talking on the phone. I pulled a cart out of the row and continued further into the store. Some of the overhead lights flickered, and they nearly sent me into a panic. But I continued through the store, putting canned food in the cart, as well as some fresh foods. I got a small, portable gas stove, some small propane canisters, some small pots, and some big gallon jugs to fill up with water. Again, I had no idea if it was safer to live indoors or outdoors at this point. 

While walking around the tech aisles, I bumped into a shelf of Xbox games and a bunch of them fell on me and the floor. The sound echoed throughout the entire store. I sighed and started picking up the games, when I stood back up, a middle-aged man was staring at me a few aisles down. I paused for a moment, not knowing if he was like the old lady from last night. I was right, the man began to charge me, but I turned and ran in the opposite direction. I ran into the sporting goods aisle, hearing the fast-paced footsteps behind me. I turned to my left and grabbed what was closest. It was a baseball bat. The man was getting closer, only a few feet away from me before he said it. “We want-“ I smacked him across the face with the baseball bat and he immediately collapsed to the floor. 

I walked back to my cart, and as I grabbed onto the cart, my phone rang. I took my phone out of my pocket to find that my girlfriend, Nancy, was calling me. I answered the call. On the other end was static, “Nancy?” I asked. “S..” I heard, “Nancy?!” I shouted, “S-S…” I was about to hang up when I heard, “S-Sam!” The call ended, I tried calling her back but to no avail. I started walking out of the store and stopped when I saw the old woman from last night, she was standing next to my car. Even from the storefront, I could see the toothless smile on her face. The goosebumps came back, but I knew that I couldn’t go back into the store. I started pushing the cart towards my car, closer and closer until I was within feet of the old woman. “We WANT blood, we CRAVE blood” she nearly shouted. I pushed the cart into her, knocking her to the ground. I pushed the cart to the other side of my car and quickly tossed everything into the backseat. When I looked up, the old lady started to get to her feet and the man from the store was now outside and running toward my car. I opened my car door and hopped inside, locking the door as soon as I sat down. I started the car. The two demented people began banging on the windows of my car. I put the car into drive and drove away. I’m still on the road and not too far from the Walmart, those two are still looking for me and I have no idea how many of them there are. If anyone has any idea of what is happening or what they could be, please tell me. I will update with an edit in a few hours and a part 3 as soon as I can. I think tomorrow I’m going to try to leave town.
