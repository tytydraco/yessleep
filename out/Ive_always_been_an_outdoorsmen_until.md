So, my story is as follows. I'm 18 and have always had a passion for fishing and hunting. I grew up in a small town in southeast Chilton County in Central Alabama. I have hunted and fished every since I was about five years old.

 I felt always at ease in the space of the forest or on a lake. Well, until I saw it that is. I don't know what it is but it lives here. I'm not the only one either. It was late August of 2022 and I was riding my four wheeler. Not nice but something I could take our scraps off from the days before to feed the animals. It was that dusky time in the evening where the burnt orange sky was at its fullest. 

Keep in mind, I've done this for years. There was a creek behind my house( we owned two acres behind my house) and I went riding because it had just rained and wanted to get my four wheeler a little muddy.   

It was getting dark very fast. Keep in mind im in the woods so it gets dark very fast. Not a problem I thought but oh son was I wrong. I was in first gear as I was climbing back up the trail to my house. My four wheeler was always prone to just stop. It was shitty, I admit but I grew up poor and it was like a brand new can-am to me. 

So, Im going about 5 miles per hour just creeping around and then it happened, my four wheeler died again. I thought to myself "it's the battery again". My dad always told me that I should keep a screwdriver to try to jump the battery. So I shut my headlights off and get off and take my seat off. I got my screwdriver and this Ryobi spotlight my dad had for his work. I start to try to jumpstart my battery. 

Keep in mind I have hunted and fish this part of the woods all my life. I'm not a individual who gets scared at being alone. I find a comfort in it. As I was trying to get my battery to jumpstart I kept on getting the feeling of being watched. 

It's a normal reaction in the woods as animals live out there too. I just kept working and I was at the point of just walking back considering the house was only about 4 football fields through the woods(probably shorter I'm not a mathematician). Hell I didn't honestly wanna go back in the morning to go get it. So i kept working. Then it started. 

I heard a rustling like something moving around behind me ( for my hunters, like when a deer breaks leaves as they are walking) instinctly I think "oh, its a deer just moving around. Five minutes probably passed before I heard it again. This is the moment when you know you fucked up. 

Now , I definitely know I'm being watched. I had a glove department on the back where I kept everything and I dropped it open to get my dads 357 out just in case it was a random meth head walking around. I shouted out into the darkness, "I have a gun and I'm not afraid to use it". I was met with silence from the forest in front of me. I turn around now shaking and trying my damnedest to get it to start. Then I hear it.

I can only describe it as when you try to get up out of bed and your bones creak. I turned around to face whatever it was. I shined my light in the direction and to my terror I see it( I still don't know what it is). It stood up just right behind the ponderosa tree that was back there. 

It was pale looked very malnourished. Talk about real uncanny valley. It was approximately 8 to 9 foot tall. Taller than any human I've ever seen. My eyes locked with it. It expression calm and relaxed. Longer arms that came down to about its mid thigh. Hairless. Eyes as black as illegal tint on windows. Just staring. It had realized I knew it was there. I pissed myself in fear. I reached around to the feeling of the grip of my dads gun and pointed so quickly and just a shot rang out. 

Guys, when I say that it was unfased I ain't lying no blood no nothing. Just a scream and off behind the maze of trees behind IT. I took off so quickly( David goggins would've shit his pants) I made it to the house and my dad was there at the front door talking to my grandpa as he does every night. 

It was almost as if he knew what happened when he looked at me. He said one sentence, I will never forget . "Son , there is things that live out there that we will never be able to understand". I was muttering out what had happened and before the words rolled off my tongue , he stopped me and said " there is no more to discuss" and he never said anything about it again. 

I have talked to others about what I've seen and they all say it comes when you are at your most vulnerable. One common denominator in all of this is that it lives in only a certain mile radius in the woods. Since then I haven't been back there since. If y'all guys know what this could be or have similar encounters please reach out. You are not alone.
