“Hold on babe, I’ve just gotta run by the ATM before we pay,” I said. “You can’t just use the card, Jess?” Alexander asked me exasperatedly.  “The card machine said it was out of order when we walked in,” I told him. “Okay, fine. I’ll be over here looking at these wallets while you go,” he replied.

As I walked down stairs to the designated area for the ATM machine, I noticed a red glow pulsating slowly. When my feet left the bottom step into the dark grey carpet, I felt like I’d left the planet all together. The red light clashed with the white tile on the walls and it felt like I was in a hot box.

Surely the lights aren’t heated… I felt the need to run, go back up into the store and tell Alexander we weren’t buying a damn thing today, but he was already stressed with us relocating for his new job. He was being promoted in the firm and needed a few nicer items for his wardrobe. He’d tell me I was being silly and if I hadn’t wanted to come I should’ve stayed home.

I took a deep breath and started moving forward. I fumbled around in my purse for my wallet. In the muted red light, I managed to find my debit card.

I inserted it with intentions of withdrawing $200. The screen lit up with green letters:

—> withdrawal?

—> deposit?

—> check balance?

I pressed the button by withdrawal.

—> amount?

The machine questioned as it hummed lightly. I manually put the $200 amount in. I expected it to just give me my money when it did something… peculiar.

—> What will you give me in return?

“What?,” I muttered to myself. I tried to cancel the transaction but this machine just was not giving me my card back. I feel like I pressed every button and it still asked:

—> What will you give me in return?

I banged my fist against the screen. I felt like I was having a bad dream. This was, needless to say, the weirdest thing I’d ever experienced, and one of the most upsetting. How could I give this stupid machine anything? Why was it even asking me this?

“WHAT DO YOU WANT?” I shouted. “Just your soul,” said a airy voice. I looked around frantically and saw no one. “For $200?” I said incredulously. Not that I was going to give whatever the hell this was my soul anyway, but surely it was worth more than $200. “For any amount of money, or anything else you want” it replied.

“No. No, I can’t do that,” I said. “Really? Are you sure?,” it asked. “Yes. I’d like to keep my soul, thank you,” I told it. “Very well then,” it said, while promptly returning my debit card. I quickly grabbed it with shaky hands and ran as fast as I could back up the stairs.

I nearly plowed Alexander down when I reached the top. “Jeez, Jess. Are you alright?,” he asked. “I- I think so,” I told him. I was drenched in sweat so badly my hair was wet. “What happened. I was looking at wallets and before I realized it an hour had passed,” he said. “The ATM is broken. It was so hot down there. I didn’t want to come back without money but it wouldn’t give me my card back for awhile…,” I trailed off.

“Don’t worry, Jess. I’ll get them to hold the clothes and we’ll go down to the bank drive through, okay?” he assured me. It seemed like he was a million miles away. I nodded weakly and let him walk me to the car. The cool air outside giving me a chill.

“Are you sure nothing else happened?,” he questioned. “Yeah, it was just so hot. I think maybe I got a little dehydrated,” I said with a faint smile. Alexander got the money then ran me through the drive through for a drink.

While he went inside to pay for his clothes, I  sat in the car wondering what the hell had just happened to me. Had a ATM really asked me for my soul? Either way I knew I could never tell Alexander. He’d think I was crazy. He was one of those people that didn’t believe anything he didn’t see with his own eyes.

It’s been about a year and the thought of my experience still makes me uncomfortable. I don’t even like going to that store anymore, and I haven’t until just recently. What was strange when I went in is that there wasn’t even a stairwell there, no signs that there was an ATM, and that none of the staff even knew what I was talking about when I asked what happened to the ATM room downstairs.
