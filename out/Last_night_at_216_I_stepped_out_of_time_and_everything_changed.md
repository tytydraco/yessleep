I keep thinking I shouldn’t post this. Even typing it out feels weird, like I’m about to break some rule I don’t understand. But here I am. I guess I just need to see if anyone else has felt something like this.

It happened at exactly 2:16 AM. I know that for sure because I had just checked my phone. I couldn’t sleep, so I was lying there in bed, scrolling through the usual endless feed. Everything was normal until suddenly it wasn’t. The room didn’t get cold. Nothing jumped out of the shadows. It was like the whole world took a really long pause.

It was so quiet, it hurt my ears. I didn’t notice the silence at first. It was more like the background hum of everything—my fridge, the cars outside, the wind—just faded out. Even the glow from my phone screen seemed kind of muted. For a second I wondered if I’d lost my hearing or if maybe I was dreaming.

I got up, feeling stupid and restless, and walked over to the window. The street outside looked like a photograph. A car was stopped right in the intersection, headlights catching the mist. I swear I saw a cat in mid-leap just above a trash can. Nobody moved. Nothing moved. I remember tapping the glass just to see if anything would react. Nothing did.

I started feeling unsettled, but it wasn’t fear exactly. It was like something was watching to see what I’d do. I wandered out of my room, walked through the apartment. All the clocks were stuck on 2:16, not just my phone. The red digits on the microwave, the ancient wall clock in the hallway, my wristwatch I never wear—everything frozen.

I kept going, out into the hallway. Every door was closed except one down at the end. I know my neighbors and that door is never open. I walked toward it, telling myself I was just curious, not completely losing it. The air felt thicker the closer I got, almost like walking into a steam room. My skin prickled.

Inside that open doorway, it was pitch black. Not a normal darkness, but the kind that makes you feel like if you step through, you won’t come back. Standing right outside was this little kid. I’ve never seen her before. She looked up at me, almost bored, and said, “You’re awake, aren’t you?” Not a question, more like a statement she didn’t care if I agreed with.

I said something dumb like, “What’s going on?” She smiled, the tiniest little grin, and said, “This is the space before morning. Most people sleep through it, even if their eyes are open.” I asked her if I was dreaming and she shrugged, picked up a piece of chalk from her pocket, and started drawing shapes on the hallway wall.

It hit me then that I could feel my heart pounding, my breath in my chest, the floor under my feet. I was there, actually there, in a way I don’t remember feeling in years. She drew a circle, looked up at me again, and said, “Don’t worry. When it starts again, you’ll remember.”

I wanted to ask her what she meant, but before I could, I blinked and the lights came back. The clocks ticked forward to 2:17. The street outside was moving again. The fridge kicked on. My phone vibrated. It was like nothing happened, except everything felt different.

Today, everything has a kind of shine to it. People made eye contact on the sidewalk. I noticed a bird’s song and actually listened. My coffee tasted stronger. I don’t know how to explain it except that now, I’m paying attention. I keep thinking about that kid and the way she said I’d remember.

I don’t know if any of this makes sense. Maybe I finally lost it. But if you’re reading this, and you felt something weird last night, please tell me I’m not the only one. Even if you just noticed the silence, or the way the world seemed to pause.

Maybe we just woke up.

I keep replaying that moment, standing in the hallway, trying to remember the exact way she looked at me. It’s like some part of me has been waiting for that feeling my whole life—the sense that there’s more, and that “more” isn’t some big revelation or secret knowledge. It’s just this, right here. Being present. Actually seeing the world instead of just moving through it half-asleep.

I’m not saying I understand what happened. Hell, maybe nothing did. Maybe it’s all a trick of a tired mind and a weird night. But something deep down feels different. Things are sharper. Realer. I notice little kindnesses, tiny details. People’s faces look new.

So here’s the honest part: If you’ve been waiting for a sign, for some moment to say “yes, I’m finally ready”—maybe this is it. I think I am. I’m tired of living on autopilot. I want to notice things. I want to actually be here, even if it’s hard.

If you’re reading this and you felt that same pause, or even if you just want to believe that waking up is possible—let’s just agree, right now, to not sleepwalk through whatever comes next.

Maybe this is what it means to finally be awake.

If you’re with me, leave a reply. Even if it’s just to say you saw the same thing, or you want to. I don’t want to forget, and I don’t want to be the only one. Maybe that’s how it starts.

I’m here. I’m ready. Are you?
