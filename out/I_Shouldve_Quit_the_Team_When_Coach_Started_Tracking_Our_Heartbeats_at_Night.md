I know this is going to sound like some overblown locker-room ghost story, but I swear on everything, if you’re an athlete, or you’ve ever pushed your body past where it’s supposed to go please read this. And don’t stay on a team that treats you like we were treated.

I play varsity basketball for a small D-II college. Nothing special just a scrappy team with more grit than talent. Our new head coach, Coach Halvorsen, was supposed to turn things around. “A culture reset,” the athletic director called it.

The first weird thing was the **bands**.

At our first team meeting, Coach wheeled in a case of black wristbands, thick silicone straps with a metal plate on the underside.

“These measure stress, recovery, fear response,” he said. “They’ll help me push you to the brink safely.”

The *fear response* part got some chuckles, but Coach didn’t smile.

“These stay on. You sleep in them. You shower in them. If you remove them, I’ll know.”

That wasn’t hyperbole, whenever someone took theirs off, Coach would show up within minutes. Once, Jackson slipped his off in the dining hall to wash ketchup off it. Coach walked in like he’d been waiting outside the door.

“You don’t take it off,” he whispered, gripping Jackson’s wrist so hard his knuckles went white.

We laughed about it later, but not for long.

Every morning at practice, Coach checked a tablet with our overnight readings. If yours were low, heart rate spikes, elevated cortisol, he’d make you run “Threshold Laps.” Over and over until you felt like your bones were rattling.

What bothered me wasn’t the punishment. It was how I *never* remembered whatever had made my readings spike. Night terrors? Panic attacks? I slept like a rock.

Then guys started complaining about **dreams**.

**“I keep seeing Coach.”**  
**“I’m running in the dream, but something’s chasing me.”**  
**“My body won’t move, but Coach is whispering right in my ear.”**

I didn’t have those dreams, until last week.

I woke up drenched in sweat. The band was burning hot on my wrist.

In my dream, I was on the court alone. The gym lights buzzed overhead. Every time I tried to walk toward the exit, my shoes stuck to the floor like the hardwood had turned to glue.

Coach was sitting on the bleachers, staring at me.

“Keep going,” he said. “You can do more.”

I tried to speak, but my jaw wouldn’t move. My heartbeat in the dream was deafening—like a drum inside my skull.

Then Coach stood, walked toward me, and

My band beeped. A shrill, sharp sound that didn’t stop when I woke up.



Not five minutes later, I heard knocking in the hallway, slow, steady *knock… knock… knock.*

My heart stopped when the knocking reached **my door**.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

“Open up,” Coach said through the wood. “We need to talk about your readings.”

I stayed silent, pretending to be asleep.

After a full minute, he exhaled, low and disappointed. Then his footsteps faded down the hall.

When I checked my band in the morning, it showed the highest heart rate spike I’d ever seen.

Yesterday, the team captain, Reese, broke into Coach’s office after hours. He said he was sick of being tracked like livestock and wanted answers.

He came out pale, shaking.

“There’s footage,” he said. “Of us. Sleeping.”

Every player. Every dorm room. Different angles.

“You don’t want to see what he does around your bed,” Reese whispered. “How close he gets.”

We reported it to campus security, but Coach was gone by the time they went to confront him. Office cleared out. Tablet wiped.

Just the bands left behind.

Except mine, because I’m still wearing it.

Because it won’t come off.

I’ve tried scissors, knives, a box cutter, it just snaps back. Tighter every time.

And last night… God…

Last night the band got hot again. And I heard breathing in my room. Not mine, **behind me**.

I didn’t turn around.

Because I knew exactly who it was.



If you’re an athlete, and you’re asked to wear something “for performance tracking,” don’t do it.

And if you ever wake up to knocking that matches your heartbeat…

**Don’t open the door.**
