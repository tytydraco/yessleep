It laid right there on the floor, in the middle of my bedroom, ready to reveal its secrets.

 

Knife in hand, I approached and knelt in front of it, filled with the hope of softening my daily life with its content. Its black leather outer shell caressed my left hand while I replied to the tenderness with the blade in my right hand, ripping it open like you would do with a fish. Rendering a sweet melody, its rattling golden zippers that had attracted me earlier that day, further convinced me that I had picked the right one this time.

 

It was as if it begged to just be stolen, and that day, I did not resist the temptation.

 

An equally black box stared back at me when I had finally opened the suitcase. Upon inspection, I realized that it was a trunk nicely fitted inside the suitcase and decorated with golden patterns. This has to contain something insanely expensive, I thought, beaming with excitement and in a hurry to open the trunk and get my hands on the loot. I then suddenly heard it: a chuckle, soft yet confident, coming from the bathroom. On the other hand, I was confident about being alone in the house at that 10pm time, especially since I was doing what you now know.

 

It was only the beginning of a very painful and dreadful night.

 

My knife still in hand, I crept all the way to the bathroom and reached the door, before suddenly storming in, hoping to surprise any trespasser. I found it empty. Maybe some sort of hallucination or the sound came from outside, I thought, before returning to the trunk in the bedroom. Once again, I knelt in front of it, and once again, before I even touched it, a sound interrupted me. However, it came from something at a very short distance from me this time.

 

I heard a man sobbing in my closet.

 

Startled, I stood up and clenched the knife, my eyes scanning the closed door of the cupboard while trying to understand what was unfolding. I wanted to speak but confusion rendered me mute and I only found myself creeping towards the source of the sound. I then stood in front of the closet at a certain security distance and finally recovered my voice:

 

"Who's in there?" I asked, failing to attach the required amount of authority to my voice and question. The intruder must have noticed it on the spot, because after hearing me, he stopped sobbing and started chuckling.

 

All hair on my body rose along with my heartbeat as I began to tremble in fear. It was the exact same chuckle from earlier that came from the bathroom, repeating itself like some messed up recording, growing in intensity and slowly evolving into a laughter. Either foolishness or an adrenalin rush then prompted me to quickly open the closet and face the consequences. The sounds stopped on the spot and I only found my belongings in there.

 

"What was that?" I wondered, unaware that a part of the answer awaited behind me.

 

While doing futile inspections of the cupboard's interior, I heard a clicking sound behind me and immediately turned around. I quickly looked around unable to spot anything out of the ordinary until I understood that the sound came from the trunk. It was now open. I slowly walked around it, eager to discover its content hidden by its open lid and at the same time dreading it. My eyes then widened as soon as I saw the pieces, superimposed into that trunk and I let out a gasp.

 

A severed foot, two hands sticking out from the macabre pile, and a severed head turned towards me with open wide eyes and a disturbing little smile.

 

Every meal I had for that day escaped through my mouth almost immediately after the gasp. My brain went blank, devoid of any thought despite all the efforts I made to grasp what I just put myself into. I stood there looking at the corpse, and it took me at least five minutes to gather myself and assess the situation: I stole a suitcase and there is a man in pieces inside, I thought. A few more minutes later, I heard something worse than all the previous sounds. It was the doorbell followed by three firm knocks on the house entrance door and then:

 

"Mr Varitz? Mr Varitz are you there? It's the police!"
