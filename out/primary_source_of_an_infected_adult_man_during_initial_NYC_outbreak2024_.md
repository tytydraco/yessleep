call me "X". I'm one of those scrounged up "volunteers" that deal with the bodies of infected. what your about to read was found in the home of "Johnathan S. Kirk" a 24 year old white man who lived in NYC. this is part one of the "diet log" as he calls it.  

My diet log

Well, I suppose I’ll start with an introduction. My name is John K. I'm 24 years old, 5ft 7in, and 255lbs. In other words, a fat fuck.  This is sorta gonna be my online diet/health log and personal diary. I'm hoping it’ll help keep me accountable as I've had issues in the past with weight loss. And maybe some of you will be motivated by my journey.

Today was the first day of my journey! I know its cliche to start during the beginning of the year, but it really does feel like a fresh start. I definitely did good today, I ate a balanced breakfast of two eggs, some yogurt and some strawberries. Then I had a lunch of a BLT sandwich on whole grain bread, less sauce and double the lettuce than id normally add; I also chose to forgo chips and had water instead of soda. Then for dinner I had a large chicken ceaser (is that how you spell it?) salad with fat free dressing and very few croutons. And I was even able to have a low cal Greek yogurt ice cream bar for dessert!  

the most important thing i did today was go to a new gym and hire a personal trainer for once a week. His name is Bear, and he sure as hell looks the part! He’s hairy and broad shouldered with  long black hair that's tied up in a bun. But what i really noticed about Bear is that his tips of his fingers were scarred and wounded, like they been chewed at and burned. Part of me wanted to ask but Bear mentioned he was an army veteran, and I didn't wanna bring up bad memories during our first session.

Did good again today, had essentially the same meal as i did the first day because some produce is going bad quicker than I thought. Ive been struggling with self-control even more than i thought, the grocery store is what a bar is to an alcoholic for me. But I'm optimistic! I heard a fitness instructor online say that if you're trying to lose weight you should shop around the edge of the grocery store and that's really helped. (mostly because I get distracted by the tech stuff lol) 

I know this journey is gonna be hard, but want to know what else is hard? Going blind and getting your legs hacked off because of unmanaged diabetes; i saw it happen to my great uncle.

Had my second training session with Bear. I really enjoyed myself, even more than I thought I would. Received some diet advice from him too, apparently, I should be eating more raw red meat and raw seafood? Seems off but I'm not the fitness guy. After the session I went to the store and picked up a couple of high-quality steaks and sashimi grade fish. I made myself a fancy little sashimi platter for dinner and holy shit. It was good, if I can lose weight eating this stuff it'll be a walk in the park!

Been feeling...weird. Not normal weird either,i have a history of depression and anxiety (who doesn't nowadays) but this isn't that, I've been feeling more...primal for a lack of a better word. I've been 2x hornier, 2x hungry, and 2x pissed off, but it feels...good? I have a family history of mental illness, and I'm worried this is a start of psychosis or a manic episode. I'm gonna talk to my mom soon, hopefully she’ll know what's up. At least my diet is going well, been eating mostly raw/rare meats like Bear told me to. I don't even crave ice cream or chocolate anymore, as the meat has started to taste sweet to me; and because of that I've lost 6 pounds! He’s a miracle worker!

Finally got the time to visit my mom and ask her about our family mental illness history in more detail. I didn't get much help, honestly, most of my family history is relatively mundane and nothing that would cause what's going on with me. I wanted to tell her more about what's been happening to me, but I don't want to worry her, she's already worried enough about me.

 I especially don't wanna tell her about the thoughts I've been having. You online folks are really the only ones who are gonna be told about what's been bouncing around in my head. I've been thinking obsessively about gore, death, murder, blood, cannibalism, necrophilia, all that stuff. I don't know what to do with myself because I don't think I could admit these thoughts out loud. Or the fact that I don't want these thoughts to stop. 

January 21st, 2024

My brain is really putting me through the ringer now. I feel crazy, crazy crazy crazy. The thoughts have been getting worse and even more delicious. On the outside i look as normal as ever, though. The fact that I've been able to keep it together and follow my diet and workout regimen all the while suffering this, surprises even myself. You know those really fucked up datura trip stories? Thats what my thoughts are like, constantly. I feel like an aware and alive zombie.



February 1st,2024

I'm sorry for taking so long to update this but I've been all over the place. On the 23rd I woke up covered in blood, and when I stood up, looked down and the tips of my fingers were mangled and chewed, ivory bone seemed to shine against the dark red blood. I rushed to the bathroom in an attempt to bandage myself up but as soon as I looked in the mirror my heart sank into my stomach. There was dark red blood all over my lips and cheeks. I didn't know how this happened, but I did know. Of course I did. I ate my fingers tips.

 For some reason my first instinct was to call Bear. I yelled at him frantically through the phone, cursing him like a preacher. After my frantic rant he was levelheaded, “I haven't done anything to you, john. I suffered too, but it's a part of becoming better for the better of the world” I believe him. Soon after I called 911, getting an ambulance to take me to the hospital as my fingers hurt too much to drive. I asked to see a psychologist at the hospital, and after a long conversation was diagnosed with OCD. It doesn't feel right at all. 

  
that's the first portion of his log. the rest is a hard read, even for me. but i will post the rest soon, as i feel the public deserves every bit of information it can get. whats left of the public, that is.
