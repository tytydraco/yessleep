I work for a security monitoring company. We watch feeds for small businesses. Gas stations, storage facilities, parking garages. Places too cheap to hire actual security guards. 

My job is to sit in a windowless office and watch twelve monitors. Each monitor cycles through feeds from different clients. If I see something worth flagging, theft or vandalism or someone passed out in a bathroom, I clip the footage and send it to the client. Otherwise I just watch.

I work the overnight shift, 11 PM to 7 AM. Four nights a week. The pay is terrible but I can do homework between incidents and nobody bothers me.

Last month I started seeing things in the feeds that didn't make sense.

Small things at first. A camera would glitch, show static for a few seconds, then come back. Or a timestamp would jump forward, skip a few minutes like the recording had a gap. I mentioned it to my supervisor and she said the system was old, probably corrupted hard drives. She told me to log the glitches and keep working.

The glitches got worse.

Cameras would cut to feeds that weren't in the rotation. I'd be watching the parking garage when the screen would flicker and suddenly I'd be looking at a different location. Empty hallways. Stairwells. Rooms I didn't recognize. Then it would flicker back to the normal feed.

I started logging every anomaly. Times, locations, duration. After two weeks I had thirty-seven incidents. No pattern I could find. Different cameras, different times, always brief. Never more than ten seconds.

Then I saw myself.

It was 3:47 AM on a Tuesday. I was watching a feed from a 24-hour laundromat. The camera points at the front door and the row of washers along the window. 

The screen flickered. The image changed.

I was looking at a kitchen. Small, outdated. Linoleum floor, white cabinets, fluorescent light fixture. A woman stood at the counter with her back to the camera. She was wearing a blue shirt and jeans, pouring something from a pot into a container.

The woman turned around.

It was me.

Same face. Same hair. Same scar on my left eyebrow from when I hit my head on a swing set in third grade. She looked directly at the camera for maybe two seconds, then the feed cut back to the laundromat.

I sat there staring at the monitor. My hands were shaking.

I rewound the footage. Watched it again. Definitely me. Definitely a kitchen I'd never seen before. The timestamp said 3:47 AM, same as the current time, but the date was wrong. It showed a date three days in the future.

I clipped the footage and saved it to my personal drive.

I didn't tell my supervisor. I went home when my shift ended and tried to sleep but I kept seeing that kitchen. The white cabinets. The fluorescent light. I'd never been in that room. I was sure of it.

But the person in the footage was me.

The next night I watched the monitors more carefully. I kept a notebook and wrote down every time a feed glitched. Most were the same as before. Random locations, brief flashes, nothing identifiable. 

At 2:18 AM I saw the kitchen again.

Same room. Same camera angle. This time the kitchen was empty. Just the counter, the cabinets, the light. The footage ran for six seconds, then cut back to the gas station I was supposed to be watching.

I checked the timestamp. Current time, but the date was two days in the future.

I started pulling old footage from the archive. The company keeps everything for ninety days before it's deleted. I went back through six weeks of overnight recordings, looking for anomalies in my shift times.

I found myself in forty-three clips.

Different locations. Different clothes. But always me, always a timestamp that didn't match. Some were in the future. Some were in the past. A few showed dates that hadn't happened yet.

In one clip I was walking down a concrete hallway. Institutional walls, painted cinderblock, heavy doors with wire-mesh windows. I was wearing scrubs. I've never owned scrubs. The timestamp said it was recorded eight months ago.

In another I was sitting in a car. Nighttime. Parked somewhere dark. I was crying. That clip was dated five days from now.

I made copies of everything and tried to find patterns. Times of day. Locations. What I was wearing or doing. Nothing connected. The clips felt random, scattered across months, showing me in places I'd never been doing things I couldn't explain.

Then I found the longest one.

Eighteen minutes of footage from a camera I couldn't identify. It showed a small bedroom. Single bed, dresser, one window with blinds. The timestamp said it was recorded three weeks ago at 4:33 AM.

I was asleep in the bed.

The camera was positioned high, probably mounted in a corner near the ceiling. It had a clear view of the whole room. I watched myself sleep for eighteen minutes. I didn't move much. Occasional shift in position. At one point I rolled over and the blanket slipped down.

At the sixteen-minute mark, I sat up.

Not like I was waking up. More like something had pulled me upright. My eyes were open but I wasn't looking at anything. I got out of bed, walked to the dresser, opened the top drawer. I took something out. I couldn't see what it was. Then I walked out of frame.

The footage continued for two more minutes. Empty room. Unmade bed. Then it cut off.

I didn't recognize the room. Not my apartment. Not anywhere I'd stayed. But it was definitely me in the bed.

I started carrying my phone everywhere, recording myself. If I was somehow sleepwalking or having fugue states, maybe I'd catch myself doing something I didn't remember.

I recorded eight hours a day for a week. Every night before bed, every morning when I woke up. I recorded my whole shift at work, my commute, my time at home.

Nothing unusual. I was exactly where I thought I was, doing exactly what I remembered doing.

But the clips kept appearing in the security feeds.

I saw myself in a parking garage arguing with someone I didn't recognize. I saw myself in what looked like an office building, walking past cubicles at 2 AM. I saw myself standing in an empty field at dusk, just standing there, not moving.

The timestamps were getting closer to the present.

I tried to find the locations. The parking garage looked generic but I drove around checking every multi-level structure I could find. Nothing matched. The office building had no identifying features. The field could have been anywhere.

I thought about going to the police but what would I tell them? That I was seeing myself on security cameras I didn't have access to, in places I'd never been, at times that didn't match reality?

Last week I saw myself in my own apartment.

The feed glitched at 1:23 AM. When it came back I was looking at my living room. Same couch, same bookshelf, same TV. The angle was from the corner near the ceiling, like the camera in the bedroom I didn't recognize.

I was sitting on the couch. Just sitting there, staring at the wall.

I stood up from my desk at work and looked around. I was alone in the monitoring room. The door was closed. I looked at the monitor again.

On the screen, I stood up from the couch in my apartment. I walked to the window and looked out. Then I turned and looked directly at the camera.

My phone was in my pocket. I pulled it out and opened the camera app, switched it to the front-facing view.

I was at work. Fluorescent lights. Gray walls. Monitors behind me showing the feeds.

On the screen, I watched myself in my apartment walk out of frame.

The feed held for another ten seconds, then cut back to the storage facility.

I went home when my shift ended. I checked every room in my apartment. Corners, ceiling, behind furniture. I was looking for cameras. Something had to be recording me.

I didn't find anything.

But I started noticing things that were slightly wrong.

Objects moved. Not far. A cup on the counter six inches to the left. My keys on the coffee table instead of the hook by the door. Books on the shelf in a different order.

Small things. Easy to dismiss as memory errors.

Except I started testing it. Before I went to work, I'd arrange objects in specific patterns. Three pens on the desk in a triangle. Four books stacked with the spines facing out. When I came home, the patterns were different.

Someone was in my apartment while I was gone.

Or I was in my apartment and didn't remember it.

I set up my laptop to record while I was at work. Pointed it at the living room, set it to run all night. When I got home the next morning, I checked the footage.

Seven hours of an empty room. Nobody came in. Nobody moved anything. But when I looked at the coffee table, the remote was on the wrong side.

I tried to think rationally. Maybe I was moving things and not remembering. Stress, lack of sleep, some kind of dissociative state. I made an appointment with a doctor.

But the footage from work kept getting worse.

I saw myself in a bathroom stall, sitting on the floor. I saw myself in a basement with exposed pipes and concrete walls. I saw myself in a car trunk, curled up, eyes open, not moving.

That clip was dated tomorrow.

Last night I watched myself die.

The feed glitched at 4:52 AM. I was looking at a room I didn't recognize. Tile floor, industrial sink, metal table. I was lying on the table. Not moving. Eyes closed.

Someone walked into frame. I couldn't see their face. They were wearing gloves. They stood over me for a long time, just looking down. Then they picked up my wrist, checked for a pulse.

They let my arm drop and walked out of frame.

The footage ran for another three minutes. Just me on the table. Not breathing. Then it cut back to the normal feed.

The timestamp said it was recorded six hours from now.

I called in sick. Told my supervisor I had food poisoning. I went home and locked every door, checked every window. I'm sitting in my kitchen with all the lights on.

It's 10:47 AM.

In six hours I'm supposed to be dead in a room I've never seen.

But here's what I keep thinking about.

I pulled the footage from every clip I've saved. Went through frame by frame. I was looking for something, anything that would tell me where these recordings were coming from.

In the clip of me sleeping, the one that ran eighteen minutes, there's a moment at the very end. Right before it cuts off. The camera shifts. Just slightly. Like someone adjusted it.

And in the bottom corner of the frame, for maybe half a second, you can see a reflection in the window.

Someone standing in the room. Watching me sleep.

The resolution is too low to see details. But I can see the outline. The shape.

It's me.

I'm the one holding the camera.

I have to go to work tonight. My shift starts at 11 PM. I thought about not going, but if I'm already dead by then, what difference does it make?

And maybe when I get there, I'll finally see where all these feeds are coming from. Maybe I'll find the source.

Or maybe I'll just watch it happen.

I've been checking the monitors from my phone. The company app lets me view feeds remotely. I've been refreshing it every few minutes.

Ten minutes ago, a new clip appeared.

I'm in my kitchen. Right now. Sitting at the table with my laptop.

The camera angle is from behind me, over my right shoulder. I can see the screen. I can see what I'm typing.

I looked around my kitchen. There's nothing behind me but the wall.

But on my phone, I can see myself sitting here. I can see the back of my head. I can see my hands on the keyboard.

The timestamp says it's being recorded right now. Live feed.

I'm going to stand up. I'm going to turn around.

If there's a camera, I'll find it.

If there's not, then I don't know what I'm looking at.

I just stood up and turned around.

There's nothing there.

But on my phone, I can still see myself. Still sitting at the table. Still typing.

The person on the screen hasn't moved.
