Update/edit or whatever it's supposed to be: 11:43 Oct 5th. I'm not doing ok. I'm not ok.  I'm not sure if I'm... Me. Who am I? I need help.im starting to hear the voice in my head, mine, only distorted. This isn't some sort of schizophrenic cry for help, it is something otherworldly. Not just in the sense of an external manipulation. It's more like something that is trying to completely take control. 

I can't remember my name. Had I posted it? I can't remember. I can't seem to read the previous contents of my last post without my vision becoming blurry and my brain seems to get foggier. I can't even remember where I live. I can only remember a face. Some sort of hideous version of the one I was used to seeing in the mirror.

I'm looking at my hands. The left is covered in blood. The previous lacerations on my hand were now extended up the length of my forearm. Again I couldn't even tell where I was. The only source of documenting my continually fucked up experience is this.

I'm confused, even the simplest instinctual  actions seem to be miles away from logical thinking. I feel lucky to be coherent enough to document anything. I can't say whether or not I did anything to deserve this. I never felt like a bad person. I've done bad things, but as always felt compassion for people and remorse for any wrongdoings.

The demonic face I had seen seemed to replace the face of random passersby. Ever so often I would hear a distorted giggle coming from whatever it was. Of course the faces which weren't a hellborn mimickery of my own gauked at me as if I we some kind of lunatic.

I walked as fast as I could, avoiding the faces of the people that I passed. Again I found myself wondering how long I've been walking. My legs are sore, I just wanted to get home, only for some reason I couldn't remember how to get there. This had to be some sort of side effect of exhaustion and maybe dehydration.

I trotted sluggishly to the nearest alley and collapsed by a dumpster. I have never felt this lonely in any sense. I buried my face in my hands and cried. I dont even remember if I was such a person as to cry. I only knew that I was utterly terrified of what I'd witnessed thus far, and dreading how much worse it may get.

In the middle of my inner turmoil I heard something. It took me a moment to realize that it was coming from the dumpster not two feet from me. I immediately figured I was merely the witness of a casual dumpster diving, but why would I hear tapping, as if from long nails.

I went completely silent as the tapping became more frequent. Faster and faster it moved it's way up to the cover of the dumpster.I attempted to slowly stand and slip away. Before I could, I noticed the lid lift, revealing two large, black eyes.

The flight instinct kicked in, but not before a head emerged from the dumpster, attached to a long neck that quickly extended towards me, opening it's mouth and extending its jaws impossibly wide into a grotesque mixture of an unnatural smile and a resemblance of pure hatred.

The gaping mouth of the creature screamed an inhuman scream that transitioned into a maniacal laughter as I turned to run. I stumbled and ended up barrelling into a few people and falling. As they stood they all expressed their aggravation. I uttered my apologies in a quivering voice and ran away, covering my face.

Am I crazy? Or is the situation I've found myself immersed in something that could only happen to someone so unfortunate to have been too curious. Too enamored with the idea of something beyond our own meaningless existence. Even if that entailed making my life a living hell. 

If things get any worse I'm afraid it won't be only myself that becomes the victim of this thing that is clearly determined to consume me. I can think of only one way to end this... The way it started. I'm heading back to the tunnel. 

I'll update one last time before I... Do whatever needs to be done.

Update: Oct 7th, 7:51 p.m
I can't take it back, and I can't take it anymore. Something horrifying was unleashed from that place. Whatever was down there, in that dark corridor below the shack, that was found in a desolate location that doesn't seem to exist to anyone else, aside from myself and my best friend, whom was dead as fuck. 

It made me tear up, thinking of Jacob still sitting in that chair, cold and lifeless. And the same thing that drove him to madness and eventually his death is now becoming my living nightmare. My fate.

The fact is something takes control of me at times, as it has before. The difference is I have memories of these moments that come in fragments. 

The pure malice I've felt in just a few seconds of these points of lucidity while still in this state... I can't describe. I feel as if I'm close to the worst possible point of no return, meaning harm to others or myself. I have to end this while I'm coherent enough to do so.

More and more frequently I've been having blackouts, finding deep lacerations in symbols I've recognized in flashes during what can only be described as glimpses of the walls of hell

I've been lucky enough to be able to document this shit storm via my phone, as it's my only outlet. That, and this platform. Who'd believe me otherwise? I'm pretty confident it's still too farfetched to pretty much anyone.

I don't know if I even love anything anymore. I feel like a non-existent, yet still tormented being trapped within the walls of existence. Nothing makes sense. The face is everywhere. The distorted demonic replica of the face I was used to seeing every day. 

It enjoys my pain, it laughs at my torment. And it wants me to do horrible things... I can't let that happen. 

I'll post soon, if I can
