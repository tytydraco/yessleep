“Beam me up, Scotty”.

  
A wry smile broke out on my face, one of the rare ones. This was the first passenger with a sense of humour in quite a long time. He smiled pleasantly at me; a smile with actual warmth behind it. He was young, handsome in a sense, with a dark grey suit, and an expensive Breitling watch in the tray by his feet. *Important* I reminded myself. *He was more important than me, someone with places to be and no time to get there.* 

  
“Have a wonderful trip, sir”. *The standard line.*

  
The electric humming had built in the background, and with a single blinding flash, he was gone. Just like the hundreds of others before him already today; forgotten, and soon to be replaced by another important person in an expensive suit.

  
I pressed the button on my control screen in front to advise the Immigration Controller that the room was ready for the next passenger.

  
\*\*\*

  
You see, you could go all day without actually having a positive interaction with one of the passengers. They existed in an altogether different class of society, a class that only interacted with those below them when they absolutely needed to. It wasn’t an attitude that I was completely unfamiliar with, coming from my background as a Flight Attendant – the almost deliberate indifference that they showed, the fact that they would put concerted effort into appearing to accidentally ignore you. That fact didn’t stop it bothering me, sucking the life out of me slowly. Despite this fact, working as a Flight Attendant had provided perks; the ever-changing views out the cabin windows, sunshine filtering through the cabin even when the world below was shrouded in rain and cloud. *I used to like that thought, sitting above the grim monotony below, basking in a sunshine that only a few thousand people at a time could experience.* The stark differences between that and my new office could not be underestimated. There were no windows in the departure lounge, and we were at least 3 stories underneath the centre of London – a far cry from cruising forty thousand feet above it all on an Airbus A350.

  
Even the term “Departure Lounge” felt like a bit of a grim joke. There was no lounge here, just a minimally appointed waiting room that houses our Immigration Department. Leather armchairs were placed carefully in corners, aiming to look inviting, but without ever being designed to be sat on. I assume they are very uncomfortable, like the ones that rich people keep in that front room of their houses, that no one ever uses, but I digress. There was no need for lounges or chairs that were actually comfortable in this place, as no one really stayed here long. That was the beauty of Relocation; a technology for people who understood that time is money, and who had a lot of one of those things and none of the other. Instantaneous travel to any compatible location on Earth. Eight seconds to be precise, between the blinding flash in the Departure Gate, and an identical flash in the Arrivals Hall. Eight seconds compared to dozens of hours sitting mindlessly in the First-Class seats, pouring energy into actively being unpleasant to the service crew. For people who were very important, this equation made a lot of sense – even when you attach a 5-figure price tag to the process. These were people who made decisions that shaped the world, or at least wanted you to think that is what they do. These people arrived at Immigration exactly when they needed to, waited no longer than was absolutely essential, and definitely did not use any of the time they were saving to attempt pleasantries with myself or any of the other Relocation staff members. 

  
A quick Passport and ticketing check was carried out prior to entering my office, and then it was a simple Interference Check prior to departing for anywhere they wanted.

   
“If you could please ensure that any transmitting devices are switched off or in Flight Mode, before placing them in the tray by your feet” I would begin.

  
“Please stand still with your arms by your side. Have a wonderful trip, sir”.

  
And then they were gone.

  
\*\*\*

  
How exactly were they transported? It wasn’t really part of my training as a Host, but it is fair to say that one doesn’t work in the business of teleporting people around the world without demonstrating some degree of curiosity.

  
*Relocated, not teleported. There’s a difference.*

  
Even my internal monologue was starting to adopt the company standard phraseologies, and that annoyed me more than it probably should.

  
I had asked at my training day but hadn’t really received the answer I was looking for. Our trainer was a middle-aged woman, dour and drab with the personality of a cinder block. Sharp around the edges, and boring. We had just sat through the standard welcoming spiel, delivered by the Director as a painfully self-indulgent promotional video. The Director was a sharp looking man, slightly greying around the temples, but sophisticated enough that it was reasonable to assume he had actually dyed these grey highlights to appear wiser. He spoke with a clinically perfect accent, almost robotic, with no discernible quirks to allow me to ascertain his background. I was rather good at that, being a seasoned Flight Attendant on British Airways’ international fleet, and it bothered me slightly that I had no idea who this man was, or where he was from. He had, after all, basically re-invented the world as we know it.

  
“Innovation really is the backbone of human evolution. Right from the beginning, we have thought outside of the box – and that is what has allowed us to excel as a species. Iterative innovation really doesn’t drive society forward – it just occupies the minds of the everyday human, keeps them productive and beneficial to the greater race. Radical innovation is what has brought us to where we are today – thinking of solutions that are so simple, yet so far removed from the current approach, that what we come up with treads the narrow barrier between science and science fiction.

  
When carrying supplies became too troublesome, someone decided to roll them, and we got the wheel. European civilisation exploded and conquered most of the world. When horses became too slow, the internal combustion engine was added to carriages – and in less than 100 years, we evolved from the 20 horsepower Ford Model T that choked and spluttered on gasoline, to the 160,000-shaft horsepower scram-jet engine on the SR-71 Blackbird; a machine built to travel so fast, it was limited by the melting temperatures of its own airframe.

  
For generations we have invested so much in being able to travel more quickly, more efficiently, and more reliably than those before us – but as evolutionary as these ideas all were, they were still thinking inside of the box, a box that they created themselves simply by avoiding the simplest question of all: why do we need to move in order to travel?”

  
It was at this point that the murmurs rippled around the room; we all knew why we were here and what the job was that we were training for. I think for some of us, me included, there was still a healthy sense of disbelief, like we were actually part of some high-end social experiment – and not attending a training day to commence work as teleportation attendants.

  
“If everyone would please put on their glasses” the drab woman commanded, her tone flat and lifeless. 

  
I did as I was told, sliding the surprisingly lightweight tinted glasses over my eyes. A few of us exchanged glances, smirking, and whispering excitedly. It was like being back in school when the science teacher was performing an experiment with vinegar and baking soda.

  
The was no countdown, no dramatic pause, if our drab instructor were even capable of such theatre.

  
A slight humming noise was perceivable over top of the chatter of our group.

  
A blinding flash lit up the room, not dissimilar to what I would imagine the first moments of a thermonuclear detonation would look like – and then he was there. Standing in the middle of the presentation area, like everything was completely normal, was a man that absolutely not been there only a split second before. I felt the breath get absolutely crushed out of my chest – there was no trickery here. The impact of the demonstration was in its absolute simplicity, no stage drama, no tricks of the light, no curtains or costume changes. Just an ordinary looking man who had quite literally teleported into the room right in front of my eyes.

  
“Relocation is the next evolution of the human species” the Director continued via the presentation screen, his pre-recorded face showing no evidence that he was aware of how utterly shell shocked his audience would be at this point.

  
“We have re-invented the idea of thinking outside of the box. We have answered the simplest of questions, and the answer is no. What are we, really? A rather convenient arrangement of atoms, connected in such a way that we live and breathe, despite sharing 94% similarity to a banana.”  
He smiled at his own wit here, a slightly strange expression that did not look unlike someone trying to smile for the first time.

  
“We are not the atoms, but the arrangement. There are atoms everywhere, all around us. Why waste time and energy moving the atoms when all we need to do is move the idea of how those atoms are arranged? That is Relocation – the realisation that we are a construct, not a thing – and we can move the idea of us anywhere in the world in only eight seconds.”

  
\*\*\*

  
Our training day had been a blur of simple explanations of impossible phenomenon. We had taken classes on basic administration and how to look after our passengers.

  
“Your passengers are important people”, our instructor had droned. 

  
“They have places to be and no time to spend getting there, which is why you are here. You are here to ensure that, due to their importance, they get where they need to be in the fastest way possible. You are not here to make conversation, or to make friends. You are here to facilitate their relocation. Your lines are as follows:

  
If you could please ensure that any transmitting devices are switched off or in Flight Mode, before placing them in the tray by your feet.

  
Please stand still with your arms by your side. Have a wonderful trip, sir/ma’am

.  
Do I make myself clear?”  
  
We had taken classes on possible issues that could occur with the Relocation process.

  
“The most common issue associated with Relocation is Ephemeris Error” stated the instructor, with about as much enthusiasm as one would expect if she were reading the terms and conditions of an iPhone. 

  
“Ephemeris Error may cause the passenger to arrive in a slightly different position to the one which is designated. There is no cause for concern, as long as the Arrival is within the arc on the floor of the Arrivals Hall. Only report to your supervisor if the Arrival is outside of the arc – the Ephemeris Error cannot be allowed to be outside limits. Ephemeris Error is generally random in its dilution of Arrival accuracy – you may see Arrivals slightly left or right of their normal position, but very rarely in front or behind where they normally arrive. We only report repeat Ephemeris Errors if there are three arrivals in a row that are perceptibly outside the normal arrival position – do I make myself clear?”

  
“Not really” I had challenged. “What causes it?”

  
“Generally speaking, interference in the time impedance module of the positional integrator caused by external electromagnetic signals, or signal interference” she had replied bluntly, as if any of those words actually made sense when constructed in that order. I glanced across at the woman next to me, my expression querying whether that had made the remotest sense to her. She shrugged, suggesting that I was not the only one in the room who had no idea what a time impedance module did. Our trainer continued

  
“Geometric Dilution of Arrival Position may also cause the passenger to arrive in a slightly different position. In a lot of cases, Geometric Dilution occurs insidiously, increasing slightly with each arrival. Again, we only report Geometric Dilution if it results in an arrival being outside the designated arc in the Arrivals Hall.”

  
I raised my hand. “If both Ephemeris Error and Geometric Dilution of Arrival Position cause the passenger to arrive in a slightly different position, how do we know which one is which in a real case?”

  
The trainer scowled, her look suggesting that I should probably shut the fuck up right about now.  
She sighed heavily before droning on, “Geometric Dilution is caused by temporarily indeterminate variables in the arctangent integrator, Ephemeris Error is-

  
“The positional integrator, yeh I know” I cut in. “But how do we actually know which it is? Because they have different reporting criteria”.

  
“Geometric Dilution is caused by temporarily indeterminate variables in the arc tangent integrator” she re-iterated, seemingly unaware of the fact I had actually just asked her a question, and that those words still made no logical sense arranged in that manner. 

  
“Subsequent variations of arrival position when affected by Geometric Dilution will always be in the same direction, and not random. Again, there is no cause for concern unless the arrival is outside of the arc that is designated for arrivals – if they are, report this to your supervisor”.

  
\*\*\*

  
Armed with absolutely no knowledge of how the entire system worked, I was put on shift, mindlessly pressing two buttons – one to advise my Immigration agent that I was ready for the next passenger, and the next to Relocate that passenger to wherever they needed to go.

  
“If you could please ensure that any transmitting devices are switched off or in Flight Mode, before placing them in the tray by your feet.

  
Please stand still with your arms by your side. Have a wonderful trip, sir/ma’am.”

  
FLASH

  
“If you could please ensure that any transmitting devices are switched off or in Flight Mode, before placing them in the tray by your feet.

  
Please stand still with your arms by your side. Have a wonderful trip, sir/ma’am.”

  
FLASH

  
And so on for eight hours a day. 

  
Until it happened. The first error that I observed. I was working Arrivals Hall, which functioned quite similarly to the Departure Lounge, albeit the lack of requirement to actually talk to your arrivals. Quite the change of pace. The room flashed, and my arrival stood before me, a good two feet to the left of where he should be. He looked slightly confused for a moment, before bending down to collect his devices from the tray.

  
*I wonder if it feels different when there’s an error.*

  
I was told there was no feeling to it – you were simply somewhere one second, and somewhere else eight seconds later. Like being under anaesthesia, those eight seconds felt instantaneous to the traveller. Unlike the complete indifference shown by most of my very important arrivals, this gentleman seemed momentarily perplexed by his positioning in my Arrivals Hall. I felt my training kick in.

  
“It appears there has been a small Ephemeris Error, sir”, I stated with a surprising degree of authority, given I still had no idea how exactly Ephemeris Error occurred.

  
“This is well within limitations sir, and there is no cause for concern. Please have a pleasant stay in London.”

  
The gentleman finished picking up his belongings, and glanced back at me, a slightly forced and pained smile on his face. It looked very much like he was trying to smile, despite his obvious dissatisfaction with whatever he was feeling. Something about this caused the hairs on my neck to prickle uncomfortably, like something that I was seeing was not quite right, but besides the two feet of supposed Ephemeris Error, everything in my field of view was perfectly normal. The gentleman left the room, and once again, the blinding flash filled the space.

  
This gentleman was a good three feet to the right of the previous Arrival, ever so slightly to the right of the typical position. I sat up straight in my chair, feeling the cold sweat starting to build on my forehead. I hoped that my demeanour was not noticeable to my new Arrival, but like the one before him, he was preoccupied with collecting his possessions from the floor. 

  
“It appears there has been a small Ephemeris Error, sir,” I stated, my voice faltering slightly this time. “This is well within limitations, sir, and there is no cause for concern.”

  
He turned to face me, a smile briefly flashing across his face. There was no warmth to that smile at all, no sincerity. It almost felt like this gentleman had only seen images of a smile in a magazine and was attempting to replicate that expression for me here in the Arrivals Hall. It was not very convincing, and I could feel my heart rate starting to increase. The back of my neck prickled with an intensity normally reserved only for sunburn. Like the gentleman before him, he turned away from me and marched out of the room without looking back.

  
*Ephemeris Error is generally random in its dilution of Arrival accuracy – you may see Arrivals slightly left or right of their normal position, but very rarely in front or behind where they normally arrive. We only report repeat Ephemeris Errors if there are three arrivals in a row that are perceptibly outside the normal arrival position – do I make myself clear?*

  
That was two in a row. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, and my throat was increasingly dry. One more Ephemeris Error and I would need to report this. *But to who?* That realisation threw me a little and did nothing to quell my anxiety. It hadn’t really dawned on my up to this point, but myself and the Immigration Agent outside the door were the only two people that I was aware of in this section of the building. I had not been introduced to anyone that I would consider my supervisor or superior. I started to realise just how inadequate my training was for this job; how little I knew about even the most basic reporting structure within the company. *How had I not realised this?*

  
*Please arrive where you should.*

  
*FLASH*

  
Perfectly centred. My newest Arrival was right where he should be. I felt the weight of the world lift off me in that moment, and my relief must have been noticeable on my face, but it was short lived. The gentleman collected his belongings and turned for the door without ever facing my way. It wasn’t totally abnormal to be ignored like this, but even the most deliberately aloof of my passengers generally couldn’t avoid at least glancing at effectively the only other thing in the room. *Had he put his watch on his right wrist?* I felt my wits rapidly sharpen, like my brain was trying to piece together a complex puzzle. *I swear the last three Arrivals have all been left-handed*. My neck continued to prickle unpleasantly, and this line of thinking was not helping. While three consecutive Arrivals being left-handed was far from impossible, it was at least improbable enough that my brain was moving into overdrive as a result.

  
FLASH

  
Another Arrival, this one a much older gentleman. Bending down with surprising grace, he collected his belongings and affixed his watch to his right wrist. My spine tingled awfully. I broke away from my typical lines, or lack thereof. 

  
“Good afternoon sir, welcome to London,” I managed to get out.

  
He never turned or so much as broke stride, opening the door and leaving the room.

  
*interference in the time impedance module of the positional integrator caused by external electromagnetic signals, or signal interference*

  
FLASH

  
A younger gentleman, in a sharp cream suit. He pocketed his phone and affixed his watch to his right wrist. My brain was starting to scream, something was not right here.

  
“Good afternoon sir, we-welcome to London”. I could no longer disguise my concern. “Do you have any plans for your trip?” Totally unprofessional, but absolutely necessary to ease my racing mind.

  
He strode to the door, completely unphased by my attempts at human interaction. I could feel the sweat dripping down by back, exacerbating the horrible prickling sensation. *Someone fucking talk to me.*

  
*signal interference*

  
*FLASH*

  
A middle-aged gentleman in a charcoal vest stood perfectly in the middle of the room. Unlike the Arrivals before him, he glanced up at me after collecting his possessions off the floor. His smile did nothing to quell my nauseating unease. Each muscle group seemed to work completely independently, like he was smiling for the first time as a fully grown man. 

  
“Good afternoon, Mia”, he began, with a noticeably perfect and indistinct accent. I could not for the life of me place where this man could have come from, *or how he knew my fucking name*.

  
It hit me like a tonne of bricks where I knew the voice from. That cringe-worthy introductory video all those weeks ago, a smartly dressed Director prattling on about wheels and horses and SR-71 Blackbird planes.

  
“Who the *fuck* are you?” I managed.

  
His faux smile had faded and was replaced by an icy expression that chilled the blood in my veins.

  
“You can’t truly believe that your *simple* species created all this, can you?” He gestured toward the ceiling, towards whatever machinery lay beyond the walls.

  
“Those Ephemeris Errors,” I interjected.

  
He laughed, a distinctly unpleasant noise, like he wanted to convey humour without actually knowing how our kind did that.

  
“A suitably complicated and intangible explanation of something quite simple,” he chortled. “You see, we weren’t completely lying. Signal interference is actually quite close to the truth; to be specific, *it is signal re-assignment to a new origin of travel*.

  
My blood ran ice cold, and my jaw clenched so hard I could feel the enamel on my teeth chipping.

  
“We needed to ensure it worked safely, before the rest of us Relocated,” he continued, turning to stride toward the open door. “But don’t worry – we’re all here now, and we’re going to have a *wonderful* trip”.
