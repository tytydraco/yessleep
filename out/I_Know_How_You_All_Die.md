I haven’t slept in days.
Every time I close my eyes, I see it happen again - your faces, your screams, the exact moment your futures end.

I guess I should start at the beginning, though time feels slippery now. I don’t know what day it is. I barely know who I am anymore beyond the one fact smothering everything else:

I know how you all die.

The first time it happened, I thought it was a panic attack. I was on the bus, half-asleep, forehead pressed against the cold window. We were passing a construction site - wires hanging loose, workers shouting - and then suddenly, the world… shifted.
I wasn’t on the bus anymore.
I was standing in the middle of a cracked road, rain bouncing off the tarmac. A boy on a bike pedaled towards me, earbuds catching the light. I opened my mouth to say something, to warn him of something I didn’t fully understand. Before I could, a delivery van shot around the corner. He never saw it.
The sound. God, that sound, it was the worst part. Metal hitting bone. The screech of brakes too late. The thud of a body folding wrong.

I screamed.
I blinked.

People stared - I was back on the bus.
The boy was still alive. Pedaling past the construction site, humming to himself. Exactly as he’d been seconds earlier.
“Are you okay?” an old woman asked me. I lied and said yes, even though every muscle in my body shook.
I told myself it was a hallucination. Stress maybe. Possibly dehydration.

But then it happened again.
And again.
And again.

A woman at the supermarket: her trolley tipped, a jar fell, glass shattered - and for a flash - I was somewhere else, watching her choke on her own blood in a dimly lit car park. 
A man jogging past me in the woods: for an instant, he was face-down on a kitchen floor, smoke pooling beneath a closed door as his lungs filled with heat.
A little girl on the playground: one blink she was laughing. The next she was floating face-down in a pond, her hair fanning out like ink in water.

Everywhere I went, people were dying, future versions of them, overlapping the present like double exposure photographs only I could see.
It wasn’t just strangers. It spread, creeping closer.

My co-worker, Jenny: wobbling on a stepstool while pinning decorations to the break room wall - then suddenly slumped over her steering wheel, music still playing as exhaust fumes filled her sealed car.
My neighbor, Mr. Carver: watering his plants, then clawing at his chest as his pacemaker failed during a storm.
My sister. My wonderful sister. 
She was brushing her hair at my kitchen table, complaining about a guy she was seeing, and then, for a split second, she was lying broken in a ditch, her phone just out of reach, headlights fading in the distance.
I begged her not to go out that night.
She just laughed and told me not to be silly. 

Now the visions don’t wait for people to cross my path. They come unprovoked. Unwanted. They tear through me like seizures. It feels like people die in my head every time I blink - crashes, falls, drownings, fires, suicides, murders. God, the murders.

I used to think it was a warning. A curse meant to help me save someone.

But that changed 3 days ago.

Because that night, for the first time, I didn’t see a single death.
I saw ALL of them at once.
A flood. A tidal wave. Thousands of endings collapsing into each other - family, friends, crowds, faces I didn't recognize - all overlapping in a single blinding surge that nearly tore my mind apart. I dropped to the floor convulsing, my teeth cutting into my tongue, but the visions didn’t stop. They kept piling on, stacking, pressing down until I couldn’t breathe under the weight of it.
And then I understood.
It wasn’t about saving individual people.
It wasn’t about timing or fate or warnings.
It was a countdown.
A single moment in time when every death I had ever seen - and every death I have yet to see - comes together. Converges. One event, one world-ending breath where everything ends at once.
That’s why the visions have been getting closer.
Why they’ve been intensifying.
Why I feel like something is standing right behind the veil of reality, watching me understand what no one should.

Because the deaths aren’t scattered.
They’re synchronized.
And the countdown is almost over.

I wish I didn’t know how you all die.
I wish I didn’t know how I die.
But unfortunately I do.
It's already written. Already chosen.
All that’s left now is the waiting.

And the sound I hear outside my door tells me I won’t be waiting long.
