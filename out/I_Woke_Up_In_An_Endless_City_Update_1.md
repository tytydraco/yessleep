That wasn’t a person.  
This is going to sound crazy, but that was *not* a person. I knew something strange was going on here, but I’d convinced myself for the first few hours that there was some kind of rational explanation. I… hadn’t decided on what that explanation actually *was,* but… well, moot point. Right as I was getting ready to publish my first post, I heard a knock on the window. You know that kind of quiet that sets in when snow gets really thick, where it makes you feel like your ears are clogged? I hadn’t realized it, per se, but it’s like that all the time here. So much fog it muffles the sounds, maybe.

So when I heard the knock initially, I just about jumped out of my bloody skin. Once I realized there was someone, I quickly posted and ran to the front to see who else was out here. In my defense, the windows were a kind of wavy tempered glass that you couldn’t make out more than vague silhouettes through, and the thing outside was humanoid.

More or less.

It looked like an art piece, some kind of twisted marriage of concrete, rebar, and spray paint. Its sides were chunky and irregular, with one smoothed out, like it was a torn-out piece of a wall that had started to get up and move. It walked on two too-spindly legs, one of which had a wide, flat hole in the middle.

Its torso was huge in comparison to its legs, giving it an almost goofy look, which wasn’t helped by the fact that it lacked arms entirely. Between the lack of arms and the thick upper body, it gave off the impression of someone in a straitjacket. I didn’t get a good look at its head.

I wish I could describe it further, but honestly, I only saw it for a split-second. I slammed the door in its face and just ran. I ran way too far, way too fast, and now I’m cowering in an empty parking structure. The spiral just seems to keep going up forever. I’m on floor 4, and if I want to keep contact with the outside world, I’m going to need to find a working outlet somewhere. I’m also kicking myself for pushing my body. I have no idea if the thing was able to follow me- or if it even tried- and I’m already getting thirsty from the run. I don’t know if there’s any working plumbing around here.

Fuck. Piss. Bugger. Writing this helped calm me down, at least.

Okay. Priorities. I need water. The human body can survive without it for around 3 days, but not only has my clock not been reliable, but that’s in ideal circumstances. Losing half your body’s water to terror sweat is going to shorten that timer. I need to scout buildings for plumbing. Sinks, bathtubs, even toilets, if I have to. It’s my most pressing concern. After that… figure out what the hell is going on with this place. Where I actually am. *When* I am, maybe. After my run-in with the concrete freak, I’m officially not ruling anything out, including the possibility that this is somehow London in the distant future. I feel like I would’ve noticed if I’d been cryogenically frozen, but… um. I’m getting ahead of myself. I’m going to go look around. I’ll report back what I find.

\-

FUCK. It’s been an hour. There’s nothing.  
Oh, don’t get me wrong. There’s *plumbing.* I’ve seen sinks, water fountains, you name it. None of them do anything. No guesses yet as to what’s going on there, but it’s a mite inconvenient. I looked around a bit, hoping to find some basins that were still full- so, basically, a loo. But, every toilet I found was empty. I’m almost relieved I didn’t have to stoop to that.

Why does the power work, but not water? I don’t understand the rules of this place. (If there even are any rules.)

Something to worry about later. Right now, I *have* to find a source of water. There must be a pond somewhere, or… a water tower, maybe? If I can get out of the downtown area and find some actual nature, some grass or something, I feel like I’ll have better chances. But… I haven’t seen anything green since I got here. There aren’t even any trees planted along the sides of the streets.

I’m finishing packing up everything right now. I’ve got a loose tablecloth I tied into a sort of knapsack around the end of a piece of rebar, and I grabbed anything I thought would be useful. Some of those pastries, spare bits of cloth, a pipe I might be able to bludgeon something with in a pinch. Not sure how much it’ll help against concrete monsters, but if I’m being honest, the weight makes me feel better. I’m going to try to keep this updated regularly as I go, but I *do* need to keep my eyes peeled. If I end up dead out here, I hope at least someone out there is reading it. I’ll be back when I have something more to report.

I have something to report.

So, I’m still downtown, first of all. No foliage to speak of, but there’s plenty of buildings. They keep getting stranger the farther I go, and it *still* hasn’t gotten dark. The repetition would be maddening if it weren’t for the oddities of the buildings themselves. I’ve noticed some trends.

They’re all unique, in some way. No two are exactly alike. I still see big apartment blocks with clean chunks sliced out of them, but some have more rough breaks, like they were torn apart. There was one that was so squat and low that I wouldn’t have been able to fit in the door without laying down and crawling through on my stomach. The building’s roof didn’t even reach more than a foot or two above my head, and I’m not exactly tall.

Some of the structures are so precarious, I can’t believe they can even stand upright. I’m no architect, but when I saw what looked like an office building with giant concrete pillars that were clearly there for structural support around the beveled-in ground floor, no less than half of which were completely disconnected from the base, I had to believe that there was something strange going on. The holes in those pillars followed a kind of pattern, too- four long gouges dragged horizontally across the building face, like something sharp had sliced through them in one fell swoop. Never mind that at their thickest, they were at least a meter of solid concrete.

Some of them don’t make any sense at all. I mean, even less than the ones I’ve described before. They’re relatively rarer, but there’s some buildings that I couldn’t see a clear purpose for at all. Some without doors or windows, some without any way to get between floors, some in strange, twisting shapes, more like some psychotic rollercoaster track than a place where people are meant to live or work. One was a slab of solid steel, a rectangular prism that spiraled in on itself, getting thinner and thinner as it rose into the sky. I didn’t see the end of it, but it couldn’t have been wide enough for a person to even fit on the interior by the time it disappeared into the clouds above.

Since I know people are liable to ask, no, I haven’t seen any more of those… things. I’m not actually sure there *are* any more. Well, maybe I’ve seen more, but not up close. Every once in a while, I’ll catch glimpses of something moving in the fog. Something vaguely humanoid. It’s always out of the corner of my eye, and when I check more closely, I’ll find nothing. After the second time it happened, I elected to just keep the pipe in my hand, rather than needing to draw it from my makeshift knapsack. I’d give it a 60% chance I’m just jumping at shadows.

But, it’s hard to blame me, right? This place is downright *eerie.* Walking down the endless streets, I have a hard time staying focused on the reality around me. The fog coats the air in a thick blanket of muffled silence, so even my own footsteps and breathing sound alien and unreal. The whole place is so still, only the intermittent changing of the traffic lights and my own movements remind me that I’m not looking at a painting.

I keep thinking about my home. About Porter. I miss him. He always knew how to make me feel safe, and I could use a bear hug right about now. He isn’t exactly brawny, but he has a way of wrapping his arms around me so tightly that it feels like I’m a kid again, warm and safe under layers of blankets. I tried to text him an hour ago. My mama and baba too. Nothing. I can’t even tell if they went through.

I know it’s silly to say, but I was almost afraid to reach out to anyone directly, because that would make it… real? For a while, I’d hoped that this was a dream. I know, I know. Clichè, right? In my defense, I had good reason to think it might be. See, when I was a little girl, I used to sleepwalk.

It’s called parasomnia. Or, more specifically, it’s a subset of parasomnia called somnambulism, but the doctor who first treated me called it a parasomnia. I only learned the distinction later.

Anyway. It was bad, whatever you want to call it. “One of the worst recorded cases in modern medical history”- a fun tidbit I overheard from the doctor talking to my parents, when he should’ve known damn well that his office door was thin enough I could’ve overheard. The stress from hearing that probably didn’t help matters much. Either way, everyone was suffering for it. I would stand at the foot of my parents’ bed, mumbling incoherently, turn on a bunch of lights in the flat, or make food in the middle of the night. Once, my mama got woken up by the cold. She rolled out of bed to find the front door wide open in the middle of January, and saw me standing in the middle of the street, eyes wide open and completely glazed over. She said I was staring up at nothing.

After that, they decided we needed to treat it. Normally, in kids, sleepwalking goes away on its own, but that’s only provided you *don’t* get hit by a car in the middle of the night. I got put on some heavy antidepressants, and pretty soon, it stopped happening.

I never really *stopped* taking them, per se, but you know how it is. After a few years, you start to slip. You forget to take them every single night, and when nothing goes wrong that night, it becomes less of a priority. At some point, my sleepwalking stopped being an issue, and I never noticed. I hadn’t gotten a new prescription since I was 15. Until a few months ago. I’ve taken to staying the night at Porter’s flat more and more, since it’s either that or my dorm, which is depressing enough that I’d take a night just about anywhere else. He told me he heard me talking all night a few months back, then saw me snooping around his junk drawers.

It happened a few times before he thought to actually tell me, and since I’d never explained my sleepwalking to him, he thought I might have been screwing with him, or cheating on him or something. It hasn’t been every night since then, but it’s been getting more frequent. I meant to get back in contact with our old doctor to get another prescription, but classes and work always seemed to take precedence. You know how it is.

Here’s the thing, though- I *remember* the sleepwalks. That’s pretty unusual on its own, but not out of the question. It’s just that every account I’ve heard has always been fairly vague about the whole thing. They talk about fuzzy memories, impressions and emotions. But I *remember* them. Not as they actually happened, but as clearly as any other memory. They don’t fade the way dreams do. When I would sleepwalk, I would see things. Strange worlds and beings, different versions of the place I was actually in and the people that were around me. 

I do remember the night I stood in the street. I didn’t want to admit it at the time for some illogical childish fear of getting in trouble if I said it, but I wasn’t there for no reason. In my head, I wasn’t in a street. I was in a field of dry, dying grass. A lone house- *my* house, sat atop the hill behind me. I’d gotten out of bed with a conviction that I needed to check something outside, and when I got there, I just stood in awe. The moon was different. Not the moon I knew. It hovered in an empty sky, pale and reddish, with a sort of shifting, eerie light dancing across its surface. It reminded me of the way light moves at the bottom of a pool of clear water. Right before my mama woke me up, physically hauling me out of the road, I remember thinking that something was watching me.

That… was a lot, I know. But maybe you understand why I wasn’t more freaked out when I woke up here. The sleepwalking’s been getting bad again, and I haven’t been dealing with it like I should. So, maybe I was too ready to accept what is by all rights an insane situation, assuming it was just another half-waking dream. Empty, foggy city? Sounds just like something I’d dream up.

Except… I’ve been here too long. My memories are too clear, and while I know you don’t *feel* like you’re asleep when you are, there was something else. It only hit me before I decided to leave.

My phone.

I’d *read* an article on my *phone.* 

If you weren’t aware, one of the few ways to tell for sure if you’re dreaming is to try and read something. Brains can’t handle writing while asleep, for some reason. The text will dance before your eyes, change and morph into something illegible. I know because I’ve *done* it before. I built a habit that I’ve long since lost of reading everything I can, just in case it wakes me up while I’m sleepwalking. It’s worked before, too. The realization that I’m asleep is sometimes enough to jar me back to reality.

But I did it here. And the words made sense.

I’m not dreaming.
