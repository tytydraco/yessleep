The soles of my shoes were almost worn through, just thin scraps of rubber between my feet and the endless road. I felt every pebble, every crack in the pavement as I walked, mile after mile. My legs ached, a constant, dull pain that I’d gotten used to. It wasn’t like I had a choice—there was nowhere to stop, nowhere to rest that felt safe. It had been weeks since I’d slept anywhere with a roof. I couldn’t even remember what it felt like to lie down on a real bed.

The towns blurred together after a while. Some were just a few houses and a gas station, others had diners or motels that looked warm, but I never went in. People didn’t really see you when you’re homeless, not unless you got too close, and then they’d give you that look. The one that said, "Keep moving." So I did. I always kept moving.

There were days when I thought about sitting down and just stopping, letting my body give in to the exhaustion, but something always pushed me forward. Maybe it was the hope that the next town would be different, that maybe I’d find a place where someone would look at me like a person and not a problem to ignore. But that hope felt thinner every day, just like me. 

The hunger was the worst part. It gnawed at me constantly, a hollow ache that never went away. I learned to ration the little food I managed to find—half a sandwich here, a stale bagel there. I’d pick through dumpsters when no one was watching, but even then, there wasn’t much. People don’t waste as much as you’d think, or maybe it’s just that there were too many others like me, all picking through the same scraps. 

Water was easier, at least sometimes. There were parks with fountains, or if I was lucky, a fast food place that didn’t mind me filling up a bottle in the bathroom. But there were days, long stretches of road between towns, when my throat was dry and my lips cracked. Those days, I just focused on putting one foot in front of the other, because stopping meant giving in to the thirst, and I couldn’t let that happen.

The nights were the hardest. Once the sun went down, the cold crept in, and it wasn’t just the physical chill. It was the loneliness, the kind that wrapped around you like a blanket of ice. I tried to find sheltered spots—under bridges, behind abandoned buildings—but there was always that fear. The fear of someone finding me, kicking me out, or worse. I’d sleep with one eye open, listening for footsteps, trying to ignore the sounds of cars passing by, the lights flashing in the distance.

Sometimes I’d see people driving home, their faces lit by the glow of their phones, laughing, talking, completely oblivious to the world outside their windows. I’d wonder what it was like to have a place to go back to, a place that felt safe. But those thoughts were dangerous, a distraction. So I’d focus on the road again, on the next town, the next step.

Once, I tried asking for help. I’d stood outside a grocery store, holding a cardboard sign I’d found, scribbling “Hungry” with a broken marker. People walked by, not even looking at me, their faces turned down like I didn’t exist. Some pretended to check their phones or hurry their kids past me. One guy threw a half-empty soda can at me, told me to get a job. Like I hadn’t tried. Like it was that easy.

But I learned my lesson. Don’t ask for help. No one’s going to save you. You’re on your own out here.

I’ve been walking for so long now that I don’t even remember where I started. One town fades into the next, and it’s all just one long stretch of road, with no end in sight. Every day is a battle between the part of me that wants to keep going and the part that wonders why I bother. But I keep walking. Maybe there’s something ahead, something better. Or maybe there’s just more road.

Either way, I don’t have a choice. So I walk.
