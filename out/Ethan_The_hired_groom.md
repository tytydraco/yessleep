Ethan, a 17-year-old boy with skin as pale as the moon, messy red hair falling over his crystal-cold blue eyes, always dressed in his worn black jacket and dark pants that made him look like a walking shadow. His life was pure hell. His father was a violent alcoholic, a burly man who came staggering home from the factory, with bloodshot eyes and fists ready to strike. Many nights, Ethan and his mother ended up curled in a corner, feeling the burn of the blows and the echo of insults that resonated like thunder in the empty house.

His mother... poor woman. Years of abuse had driven her mad, with episodes where she lost control and scratched Ethan, screaming horrible things while tears ran down her face. But then she would repent, hugging him while sobbing and asking for forgiveness. Ethan loved her anyway; she was his only light in that darkness. At school, things didn't get better: bullies humiliated him for being poor, pushed him against cold metal lockers, laughing at his old clothes and that he never had money for anything. The family barely survived; the little money his mother earned as a waitress went to his father's alcohol, and now she was getting sicker and sicker, with a mental breakdown that was becoming physical, coughing up blood and needing expensive treatment that never came. Ethan felt trapped, as if invisible hands were slowly strangling him every day.

One night, unable to sleep with his heart beating like a war drum, Ethan opened his broken laptop in his freezing room. The blue glow of the screen was the only thing cutting through the dimness. Desperate to find a way out, he dove into the Deep Web, that hidden labyrinth of the internet where normal people don't enter. He navigated through forbidden forums, with black backgrounds and red texts blinking like evil eyes. There, on a site called "Shadow Escorts," he found people who offered him work. It was nothing good: they hired him to assassinate, but disguised as something innocent. Ethan was handsome, with that red hair and blue eyes that attracted girls from afar, despite the bullying. They would pay him to act as a "rental boyfriend" for just 24 hours... and then, eliminate the victim. He hesitated a lot, feeling a coldness creeping up his spine, but when he saw his mother collapse again on the kitchen floor, gasping and spitting blood, he accepted. The money was too good to refuse.

His first mission was terrifying. He was hired for a rich girl from the neighboring town. Ethan met her in a dark park, under streetlights that buzzed like dying insects. They spent the 24 hours pretending: walks through rainy streets where water splashed like cold tears, forced laughter in cafes smelling of burnt coffee, stolen kisses that tasted like betrayal. She quickly fell in love with his fake charm, not knowing it was a trap. When time was up, at midnight, Ethan took her to a deserted alley. His heart hammered in his chest, sweat prickled his skin. He took out a knife hidden in his black jacket, and with a quick, silent movement, he cut her throat. The gurgling of blood on the wet pavement still haunts him in nightmares. He left her there, disappearing into the shadows. Days later, police found the mutilated body, but Ethan already had the money in his anonymous account. There was no trace connecting him.

And so more assignments began. Each time, the same thing: girls who "bought" him for 24 hours, falling in love with his mysterious appearance. Ethan seduced them with cold smiles, took them to isolated places at the end of the time... and killed them. Some with the knife, feeling the warmth of blood on his hands; others strangled, hearing their last choked gasps in the darkness. The bodies appeared mutilated or simply disappeared in black rivers or dense forests where crows cawed like demonic laughter. With the money, he bought medicine for his mother, food for the house, a little hope in the midst of horror. But his father discovered it. One night, drunk as always, he burst into Ethan's room with eyes red with fury, demanding the money while waving a broken bottle that shone like a weapon in the dim light. The fight was savage: blows that sounded like bones breaking, furniture overturned with a crash. Ethan, cornered and filled with accumulated rage, grabbed a kitchen knife. He plunged it into his father's chest again and again, feeling the flesh give way and warm blood splatter his face. The man fell to the floor gurgling, his glassy eyes fixing on Ethan one last time. He dragged him to the basement and buried him under the cold dirt floor, where the smell of rot mixed with that of death.

For a while, things improved. Ethan's mother recovered a bit with the treatment, but the illness was too strong. She died in her bed one dawn, her fragile body pale as a ghost, leaving Ethan alone in that house that now smelled of death everywhere. Desperation consumed him like a black fire: he realized that life in the Deep Web was a pit of monsters, rich and sick people who played with lives as if they were nothing. Rage blinded him. He tracked down his main boss through encrypted chats, an anonymous voice that became a real man in a luxurious penthouse in the city, surrounded by luxury that stank of corruption.

Ethan broke in one stormy night, with a stolen gun tucked in his black jacket, the cold metal pressing against his skin like a reminder of his new reality. He climbed the emergency stairs, hearing his own ragged breathing and thunder rumbling outside. He found the boss in his office, a fat guy with an arrogant smile. Ethan didn't hesitate: he took out the gun and fired. The blast was deafening, like a scream in the void; the bullet entered the man's chest, splattering blood on the white marble walls. He fell to the floor writhing, and Ethan gave him the coup de grâce in the head, the echo resonating like an inevitable end.

Since then, Ethan disappeared into the shadows, becoming an independent hitman. They say he's still out there, a ghost with messy red hair and icy blue eyes, dressed in black and armed with his gun. Reports of missing people rise wherever he goes, girls found dead in alleys with their throats cut or bodies hidden in forgotten places. And if you hear a soft knock on your door at midnight, with the wind whispering your name... don't open. Because Ethan once whispered to a victim he let live by mistake: "In the end, we all hire our own demons... and mine always arrive on time, with the knife ready and the gun loaded."
