*Thursday, August 31st, 2023.*

I woke up during the night to the feeling of a tickle in my throat. I groaned and let off a soft cough, hoping the tickle would just go away, but unfortunately it didn't. I opened my eyes slowly, meeting the sad darkness of my bedroom. I glared over at the glowing green clock on my bedside table; *4:25am;* groaned again, swinging my legs over the side of my bed, gently pulling the thin blanket off of myself. A shiver went through my spine as I felt the cold winter air on my legs, just feeling the goosebumps arrive.   
I rubbed my eyes as I stood, turning to walk out of my bedroom, the glow from the hallway's night light beaming from under my closed door. I approached my door and opened it, the colder air from the hallway hitting me in the face. I coughed more and tried to scratch my throat from the outside as I headed towards my kitchen. I grabbed a glass cup from the cabinet and filled it with water at the sink. I drank the water. It was cold and hurt my teeth as the water entered my mouth, but it was still very soothing to my itchy throat.  


I sighed, putting the glass cup down on the sink, I yawned, simply just heading towards the living room, I decided that since I was already awake I might as well start my day, despite how early it was, I turned the light on and I squeezed my eyes shut before going to the couch and sitting down, my pet black cat *'Midnight'* meowing and hopping up on my lap. I patted her and smiled down at her, *"Hey baby..."* I muttered before turning on the TV, letting off another cough. Maybe I should go to the doctors today.

*Friday, September 1st, 2023.* 

I woke up coughing, I groaned again after my coughing ended. I opened my eyes to the moonlight gleaming through my window, I turned my head up to the green glowing numbers; *3:49am;* I sighed, the tickle now being at the back of my throat, I threw my legs out of bed, meeting the cold chill of the air and the coldness of the floor tiles in my bedroom. I let out a soft groan filled with annoyance and headed out of my bedroom and to the kitchen. I coughed softly as I got to the kitchen, grabbing the glass from the night before and filling it up with water. I quickly sculled down the water, it hurt my teeth again with every mouthful I took. 

I sighed and put the glass back down on the sink, I took a deep breath and walked back to my room, wriggling my way back into my covers and slowly drifting off. Though, I soon woke up again to hearing Midnight yowling at something, *"Midnight.!"* I yelled out, but Midnight didn't stop. I sat up, *"Midnight!"* I snapped, Midnight meowed and came running out from the bathroom across from my bedroom, though the yowling continued. I groaned out, and fell onto my back, covering my ears and ignoring it. Probably just a cat outside, right?

*Saturday, September 2nd, 2023.*

I woke up to yowling again, I looked over at the clock; *3:36am;* I rubbed my eyes, *"Midnight,* ***shut up!"*** I yelled out, slamming my hand down on the bed but I felt something fluffy. I glared down at my hand, it was Midnight, she was looking around, *alerted* to something, she looked at me, getting up and coming over. Midnight sniffed my face. *"Sorry, Midnight... I thought that was you."* I whispered to the small black cat as I scratched her ear. The yowling continued and I sighed, *"You hear that too, don't you, Midnight?"* I sighed then suddenly the tickle was back, I coughed and coughed, trying to get the tickle out. I held my throat as I coughed, my eyes watering and my face going red. Midnight brushed herself up against my chest.   
Finally, I stopped coughing but the tickle was still there, *lingering.* I continued to pat Midnight, listening to her purring, *"Wanna come to the kitchen with me?"* I said gently before picking up the small ball of fluff. I slowly stood up and headed to the kitchen, listening to the yowling growing louder outside.

I walked into the kitchen after it felt like hours just walking there. I gulped and did the same as the past two nights, I filled up the glass and chugged the water down, although this time it didn't help as much. I put the glass back on the sink and slowly walked back to my bedroom, carefully sitting back on my bed, Midnight in hand. I laid back and closed my eyes, Midnight curled herself up on my stomach. I fall back into slumber.

*Sunday, September 3rd, 2023*

I woke up to yowling and my throat tickling again. I look over at the glowing green numbers again though this time, they were slightly blurry. I blinked a couple times and finally read the time; *4:10am;* I sighed and sat up, rubbing my eyes. I slowly stood up and wondered to my bathroom, opening the cabinet in there. I slowly pull out some cough medicine, in hopes to sooth my throat a bit better than just drinking water. I open the bottle and take a swig of the medicine, swallowing it easy, *"grape flavor... makes everything better."* I chuckle to myself before putting it back in the cabinet.  
I sigh and close the cabinet then look at myself in the mirror, *"what is happening..."* I rub my eyes before I suddenly feel dizzy and nauseous, I heave and gag, making a quick turn and going over the toilet, throwing up whatever my last meal was. 

I sit on the bathroom tiles beside the toilet, I sighed heavily and buried my face into my hands. I reach up and flush the gross liquids down before standing up and heading back to my bedroom, the world spinning around me. I lay down on my bed and just bury my face into my pillow just trying to remember how well I felt the day before despite being on the phone to the local doctor, who just told me to keep drinking water and taking cough medicine. *Yeah right, like that helps.* I think to myself.  
Eventually, I drift off into slumber. Hopefully this just passes by.

*Monday, September 4th, 2023.*

I again wake up, but it was different. I heard yowling again so I looked around, Midnight was staring at me with worry in her dark blue eyes, she was yowling and tapping her paw on my cheek. I tried to speak but I couldn't and I tried to take a breath... *and I couldn't.* Except, the noise I made was more of a *gurgle.* Everything was spinning, I reached up to my throat and felt something *wet.* I pulled my hand away and looked at my fingers.  
**Red sticky liquid dripped off of my fingers.**

I stared at my fingers for a few seconds before it clicked in my brain... *blood.* I started freaking out and tried to scream but I couldn't. I started to cry silently until I felt something forcing it's way out of my throat and crawl onto my face. I looked, *a spider.* I sat silent as I looked at the creator that was covered in my blood, I cried more at the sight until I felt a rupture in my throat. Suddenly, hundreds... *no,* thousands... *no,* ***millions*** of baby spiders came rushing out of my mouth and nose, choking me.  
I passed out after that, feeling nothing, thinking nothing and seeing nothing.

*Tuesday, September 5th, 2023.*

I woke up, yawning and stretching, I felt my warm covers and the bit of fluffy pressure next to me, I wondered what I'd do today, and as I looked around, I saw the beaming sunlight coming through the cracks of my curtains. I look at the green numbers; *8:57am;* I smile until it faded away again, I reached up and checked my throat, nothing wet, no holes of where the spider had exited and more importantly, *no tickle in my throat.* I sighed in relief as I sat up, Midnight meowed, showing me that she was hungry, I chuckled and sat up in bed.  
I looked around and smiled wider, and after over a week of agony... *peace.*
