Rainbow Creek isn’t the most interesting town, and it likely wouldn’t exist at all if not for the two colleges it was built around, or the federal prison a few miles outside of town. It’s a small city nestled in the Montana mountains, and while the locals are happy to live the small city life, college students, like me, crave things that remind us of the cities we came from.

That’s what brought me into Gannon’s antique shop. Back home my mother would take me antiquing with her. She had a taste for the old and unusual, and as I was nearing the end of my first semester of my freshman year, I found myself feeling homesick. So, one day, as the cold late autumn air nipped at my skin on my evening walk, I finally decided it was time to drop into the old antique store.

There was an old bell that rang as I opened the door, and the old man behind the cash register barely acknowledged my presence, looking up from a stack of old documents he was reading that I guessed must have something to do with the jeweled sword laid out on the countertop.

I started browsing the wares and was quick to notice that this was unlike any antique shop I’d ever been in before. The antique stores I was used to shopping at with my mom had old things, some up to maybe two-hundred years old, but this place was in an entirely different class.

Old was not a strong enough word for many of the items old man Gannon had for sale. Many of them would be better classified as antiquities. The newest item I found was labelled as being from the year 1852, but most were older than the fifteenth century, and some were even marked as being over two-thousand years old.

It was one of these older items that caught my attention. It was a bronze figurine, roughly six inches tall of a winged, goat-headed, hermaphroditic creature with serpents crawling across its belly. The craftsmanship was exquisite, showing every detail in clear relief with such a lifelike appearance that I could almost see it move. The eyes were made of some kind of deep red jewel that seemed to glint with a light all their own. The body was completely corrosion-free and shone like it had just been polished.

It was ugly and beautiful. It was alluring and horrifying.

I had to have it.

I checked the label next to it. It read simply *Idol of Baphomet Circa 500 CE $3,600*.

I was no expert on ancient artifacts, but I did know that high quality art from before the renaissance was ridiculously expensive, and this figurine, this idol, was far more finely crafted than anything I had seen in museums. If it was real, it was a true masterwork of antiquity, and that made it vastly underpriced.

Still, $3,600 is a lot of money. It was, in fact, exactly as much money as I had in my bank account after paying bills for the month. I’d been saving for a rainy day, setting aside something from every paycheck I’d received since I got my first part time job at the age of sixteen, and it represented my life savings, but this idol was too good an opportunity to pass up.

I took it to the checkout counter and got old man Gannon’s attention. “I want to buy this,” I declared.

He looked at me, and he looked at the small idol I had set on the counter, then back at me again. “I don’t think you want that particular item,” he replied. “It’s special. You don’t pick it, it picks you.”

I scoffed. “Don’t insult me old man!” I replied testily. “I may just be a student, but I have enough money for this!” I handed him the label with the price listed, and he examined it intensely.

“That’s not the price I put on it,” he said slowly.

“It’s the price,” I replied hastily, sensing that the old man was going to claim the idol was supposed to cost more before jacking the price up. In fact, I was certain of it. An item of that age and quality was definitely worth more. He probably left a zero out of the price by accident.

It’s the price,” I repeated, and I have exactly enough money to pay for it.” I produced my debit card from my wallet and held it out to him.

He stared at me thoughtfully for a moment before taking my card and running it. The charge came up as good.

“It seems the idol has chosen you after all,” he said, and I could swear I detected a hint of sadness, maybe pity in his voice. “Be careful with it.”

“Wait here,” he commanded, then went into the back room before reappearing a minute later with a binder. “This is the provenance of your antique,” he said in a businesslike tone. “Be sure to read it as soon as you get home. It tells you the story of this particular item as far back as is known. There are gaps in the history, but that’s expected for an item of this age.”

I took the binder from him and flipped it open. It was filled with documents in protectors, half of them old and in other languages, and the other half new translations to English placed in a separate protector behind each original document.

“Don’t forget to read them,” old man Gannon said warningly as he packaged my new idol for transport home. “Always know the details of anything you buy, new or old.”

“Sure thing,” I said dismissively as I took the package from him and scooped up the provenance binder. “I’ll read it at my first opportunity.”

If only I had actually done as I said, maybe I wouldn’t be in the position I’m in now.

I hurried home with my prize and placed it in the center on my desk’s bookshelf.

I stepped back to admire it, snapped a picture with my phone, texted it to my mom, and called her to tell her about my amazing find. We spoke for a little more than an hour, a lot of our conversation being speculation about the true value of such an artifact, wrapping up with a promise that we would take it to an appraiser when I came home for the summer.

It was early evening by that time, and all of my friends were done with classes for the day, so I put the binder of provenance on the bookshelf, left to go party with the girls, and promptly forgot about it.

I got home late and exhausted, so tired that I fell into bed fully clothed, and I swear I was asleep before I even hit the mattress. I had vividly troubled dreams. Visions of damned souls screaming in eternal torment in Hell. Images of violence and bloodshed among the living. Lies, pain, and betrayal were all around. Behind it all, ever in the background, was a winged, goat-headed figure with glowing red eyes and an evil smile splayed across its caprine lips.

The next day was tough, not just because I stayed out too late and my first class was early, but also because my dreams seemed to have sapped the rest from my sleep, leaving me slow and foggy all day long. I barely made it through my classes, went to my dorm, and promptly went to bed despite it being early afternoon.

My dreams remained troubled, filling my head with the same visions as the night before, only closer, more present this time. I could swear I actually smelled the stench of sulfur and burnt flesh. I could feel the pain and anguish of betrayed lovers. I could taste the iron blood in my mouth as people were gruesomely murdered.

Mixed in with the overwhelming cacophony of torment, I began to feel my own response. Horror and revulsion gripped my heart, and I felt like I was suffocating, barely able to breathe as I choked on the smoke of billions of damned souls. I felt physical pain, and my mind screamed to wake up, but I could not. I was trapped in the hell world of my dreams, and there was no escape. I was bound to sleep, forced to suffer along with the many, many tortured souls that filled my every sensation.

It felt like a lifetime that night, and when I woke up to my alarm blaring next to my head, it was with a great gasp for air, trembling, and a racing heart that took many minutes to slow down as I went from gasping to hyperventilating as the panic overwhelmed me. It was only when I was able to convince myself that it had all been a dream, a horrible, horrible dream, and the waking world was safe that I finally was able to slow down my breathing, and eventually get myself under control.

I looked over to my desk and set my eyes upon the idol of Baphomet sitting in a place of honor where it was easily visible. Seeing it, I was reminded of how the demonic figure in my dreams had taken on the form of my new relic, and I wondered for a moment if the two were somehow connected. I walked over and picked it up, examining it closely from all angles. It was so lifelike, and the gem eyes were so lustrous that they seemed to glow much like the eyes of the dream demon.

“How peculiar,” I muttered quietly. “Why are you showing up in my nightmares? You’re beautiful.”

I stared into the luminous gemstone eyes of the idol as I spoke, and it felt as though they were staring back at me until I finally set it down in its place of honor and left to attend my first class of the day.

My friend, Geraldine, could see that I was out of sorts during our first class and caught up to me when it was over. “What’s going on?” she inquired. “You look like something’s eating you.”

“You have no idea,” I replied exasperatedly.

“Then give me the idea,” she quipped.

Her manner may have been on the sassy side, but I knew she was sincere. “I’ve been having nightmares the last couple of nights,” I told her. “Real bad ones, and they feel more like I’m actually there than like I’m dreaming.” I trailed off at the end, then continued. “But that’s ridiculous, right? They’re just dreams. I don’t really feel, smell, and taste anything in them any more than I see and hear in a normal dream. At least . . . I don’t think so.”

Geraldine looked thoughtful, her thin, arched eyebrows pinched in concern. “I don’t think so,” she replied. “But then I’ve never heard of people dreaming in all five senses before. Maybe we should head over to the library and check out a book on dreams.”

I shook my head. “No, you can go if you want to, but I have enough dream stuff on my mind without researching brain patters or mythology.”

Geraldine cocked her head to the side. “Fine,” she said. “Then how about we blow off some steam by skipping class and day drinking in your dorm room? I’ll even bring a dimebag to share. Your roommate dropped out. Nobody’s going to bother us while we have our own little party.”

“I have to admit that sounds like fun,” I replied with a smile. “And I could definitely use something to clear these thoughts out of my head.”

“Great!” she chirped happily. “You head home, and I’ll meet you there in an hour with everything!”

Geraldine was true to her word, and she showed an hour later, almost to the minute, with a backpack full of beer, a flask of whiskey, and a baggie of weed and rolling papers.  We launched right into our private party, leading off with a couple of boilermakers before lighting a couple of joints. Underage drinking and drug use be damned, I felt happy and free for the first time since the nightmares began.

We chatted like we always do, about anything and everything, everything that is, except my nightmares, and the distraction proved good for me. Having those dark thoughts pushed aside for a little bit of chemically enhanced normalcy was exactly the medicine I needed.

After our fifth game of Uno, Geraldine happened to look at my desk and notice the idol for the first time. “What’s that?” she inquired, curiosity taking over.

I walked over, picked it up, brought it to the table, and set it down in between us. “This is an antique idol of Baphomet from the sixth century,” I informed her. “I picked it up at Gannon’s a couple of days ago, and I’m pretty sure I got it for way less than what it’s worth.”

Geraldine was fixated on the small idol. “May I pick it up and take a closer look?” she asked. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”

“Go right ahead,” I replied with a wave of my hand. “Just don’t drop it. I’m taking my mom out to get it appraised with me this summer. If it’s worth bank I’m selling it, and I want to get top dollar.”

She picked it up carefully and turned it over this way and that as she examined it closely. “I didn’t think people knew how to make such detailed sculptures back then,” she replied. “The details are finer than even the greatest Greek and Roman master sculptors, and art was in decline in the sixth century.”

“You would know that Ms. Art Major,” I laughed.

She looked concerned. “I’m serious,” she replied gravely. “The work is too detailed to be a bronze sculpture from that time period. How do you know it’s not a fake?”

My jaw dropped in surprise. “I . . . I never thought about that,” I stammered. “I bought it at Gannon’s, so I just assumed the old man wouldn’t rip me off.”

“Did he give you any documentation we can use to validate it?” she asked.

It took me a moment to remember, but when I did I got up and went to my bookshelf. I pulled out the binder old man Gannon had given me and brought it to Geraldine. “He gave me this,” I stated. “He called it provenance.”

Geraldine set the idol down and took the binder from me. She opened it and flipped through the pages, quickly glancing at each document, taking only long enough to note that the originals showed the proper signs of age before moving on to the next page. She nodded her head approvingly. “This is good,” she said brightly. “Have you read any of it yet?”

I shook my head. “No. He said I should as soon as possible, but I’ve been too busy and tired to bother.”

“Mind if I borrow this then?” she asked. “I’d love to learn the history of this little demon of yours.”

Something about the word demon shook me slightly as the word rattled around in my brain. I dismissed it as nothing more than the jitters from two nights of vivid nightmares. “Go right ahead,” I accented. “You’re better qualified to validate this art stuff than I am.”

“Great!” she replied happily as she closed the binder. “Now how about you put your demon back where it belongs and have a rematch?”

And that’s what we did until the hour was late and we were both thoroughly faded. We said goodnight, and Geraldine took the binder with her.

My dreams that night were less intense. The hellish torments and violence were replaced with a singular vision of Baphomet seated atop a throne of bone with rivers of blood flowing out from the base. He spoke to me in a deep voice, speaking a dark language that I could not understand. With each word, I could feel a sensation in my brain like thin threads wrapping around the inside of my skull.

The great demon said something I didn’t understand, but the tone made it clear that it was a command. I obediently approached the throne and held out my hand. He took it in one great hand, and his grip was like a vise though I did not resist. He closed his other hand, leaving only his index finger outstretched, then he lowered it to my open palm and drew his long, sharp talon along it, leaving a deep, bloody gash behind.

I felt the sting as his claw pierced my skin, and the slicing burn as he cut my palm open, but I did not scream. He let go of my hand and stretched his arms and wings out wide as he stared so deep into my eyes that I could swear he saw my very soul. Under some compulsion, I raised my cut and bleeding hand, and pressed it against his bare chest, directly between the breasts, right over his heart.

Something surged through my body, and it was both exquisitely delightful and exquisitely agonizing at the same time. It branched like lightning through every organ and limb and sat in my brain like fire.

Then I woke up, my alarm blaring, telling me it was time to get up and get ready for class. I turned it off, sat up, and that’s when I noticed the severe, throbbing pain in my right hand. I looked at it and screamed in horror.

My hand was cut across the palm, blood oozing slowly through a fresh, partially cauterized wound, just like it was in my dream.

The amount of panic I experienced at this is beyond my ability to describe. I screamed, and I kept screaming until people began pounding on my door. If I hadn’t stopped and answered it, they would have battered it down to rescue me from whatever had me screaming so loud and long.

Several people offered to escort me to the doctor when I showed them my garish wound, but I refused. They would have asked questions, and my answers would have made me look crazy. Who would believe that I merely went to bed, dreamed about a demon cutting my palm, and woke up to a slashed hand in real life? They would think I was either crazy or having a mental breakdown.

I lied and told them it was an accident, that I was only screaming in pain, and that I would go to the doctor. None of it was true.

I called Geraldine, and she didn’t answer her phone. I called again, and again, and again to no avail. I went to her dorm, and her roommate didn’t know where she was. She didn’t come to class.

I was fully freaking out by the time I returned to my dorm and was fully relieved to see Geraldine waiting at my door with the binder of provenance, and a dusty old book that looked like no had read it in years.

She didn’t wait for me to acknowledge her. “We need to talk in private, now!” she insisted, dispensing with all of our usual pleasantries.

“Okay,” I said dumbly, taken aback by her alien demeanor. I unlocked my dorm, and we both entered.

No sooner was the door closed than Geraldine began to speak rapidly. “We have a problem,” she blurted. “A big, big, giant, humongous, gigantic problem!” She hurried to the table without waiting for a response and put the binder and the book down on it. “Sit,” she insisted.

“Wait,” I replied. “Whatever it is, I think we need a drink.”

She nodded in agreement, and I retrieved a couple of beers from the fridge, cracked them open, set them down on the table, and took my seat. Geraldine responded by picking up her beer and chugging it faster than I had ever seen her do before. She looked like she thought it might be the last beer she ever drank, and didn’t want to waste a moment downing it.

She slammed the empty can down on the table, belched, and tapped the binder with her free hand as she wiped her mouth on her sleeve. “I couldn’t sleep last night, so I read this,” she began hastily. Catching herself, she slowed down. “I couldn’t sleep because I was having the same crazy nightmares you told me you’ve been having, and I woke up having a panic attack after just an hour of sleep. So, I decided to read the documents your little statue came with.”

“Idol,” I corrected. “It’s an Idol.”

“I know that” she growled testily. “Stop being pedantic and listen to me. If these documents are telling the truth, we have a big problem, and we have to find a way to fix it!”

I took a big drink of my beer. “I think you’re right,” I sighed. “I had a different dream last night, but when I woke up I had this.” I showed her my right hand, and her eyes grew wide at the sight of the gash across my palm.

“Oh . . . no . . .” she said slowly. “No. no. nonononono!” She grew more frantic with every no. “It’s really happening! God help us, it’s really happening!”

“What’s happening?” I asked seriously.

She looked into my eyes with a fixed, panicked stare. “Baphomet, the real Baphomet, is coming for us.”

I shook my head in disbelief and took another swig of beer to calm my nerves. What she said was unbelievable, but she obviously believed it, and it was enough to make me question my own firm belief that nothing supernatural is real. “That’s impossible,” I replied without conviction. “And even if he were coming for me, why would he come for you?”

Geraldine opened the binder to spot she had bookmarked and tapped the page repeatedly with her finger. “It says here that the idol finds those whom Baphomet has chosen to be his servants. It says that he comes to them in their dreams, and after tormenting them with visions of their future, he binds them to him in an eternal blood oath.”

“No . . . way,” I said hesitantly, my lack of conviction apparent in every syllable and pause. “If that were true, there would be records, a lot of them!”

Geraldine turned her hands to point down at the binder. “There are,” she insisted. “Right here! Over a hundred of them. They are personal accounts and eyewitness accounts of the people who once owned your idol, and what it did to them and those around them. It’s dangerous!”

Old man Gannon’s words echoed in my memory. “Be sure to read it as soon as you get home,” I murmured.

“What?” Geraldine asked, not quite hearing me.

“Old man Gannon told me to make sure to read the binder as soon as I got home,” I replied. “I didn’t, and you’re starting to make me think I should have.”

She turned the pages back to the first one, then flipped to the English translation. “Read this!” she commanded, sliding the binder over to me.

“Beware the Idol of Baphomet,” I read aloud. “This graven image is no mere trinket. It is empowered by the demon lord himself, and failure to perform the proper rituals will result in your doom.”

I looked up at my friend. “This is serious?” I asked, already knowing the answer, but wishing for a different one.

She nodded gravely. “It goes on to give a detailed ritual that must be performed before you go to sleep any day that you touch the idol once it comes into your possession. Failure to do it opens you up to Baphomet and allows his influence to spread to others through you if you let them touch it too. They can cleanse themselves with the same ritual, but it has to be done before they go to sleep, or else he can claim them too.”

“Then let’s do the ritual!” I blurted. “Let’s do it now and get it over with, and never touch that accursed thing again!”

Geraldine shook her head with tears welling up in her eyes. “It doesn’t work that way,” she said sadly. “Once he’s in you, he’s there to stay. This binder is filled with people’s failed attempts to regain their freedom once they let Baphomet in, and nothing worked. No exorcism. No ritual. No holy trinket. Nothing released them from the demon’s grasp.”

I felt a crushing weight inside my chest as her words sunk in. I sat back in my chair, fully deflated. “So, there’s no hope,” I said resignedly. “We’re both doomed.”

“Maybe not,” she replied with faint hope. One of the documents mentions a book called, well, in English it’s called the Tome of Dreams. I went to the library as soon as it opened hoping to find a translated copy, and I did!” she held up the dusty old book triumphantly.

I spent my entire day reading it, and it mentions a way to fight back, but it has to be done inside the dream itself. But there’s a catch!”

“And?” I inquired impatiently, not liking the theatrics.

“It says that if you fail, your fate is sealed, and the totem that brought the demon upon you will seek out a new servant.”

“Well, that’s not high stakes at all!” I said sarcastically. “And what happens if we do nothing? If I just keep the idol and go about my life as best I can with completely messed up dreams?”

She gave me a serious, fixed gaze that demanded and held my attention. “The same thing, only slower as he gradually hollows you out and enslaves you to his will.”

I felt utterly defeated. “Then I guess we have no choice. What do we do?”

“Not we,” she corrected. “I. I am the most recent person touched by Baphomet’s influence. I have to do it first, and if I succeed, I can guide you through it, both here, and in the hell world.”

“You mean the dream world?’ I asked.

“No,” she said flatly. “These dreams aren’t dreams. They’re us, literally us, our souls, being taken to Baphomet’s realm in Hell. It’s a hell world.”

It took a moment for the gravity of her revelation to properly sink in. “Well. That . . . sucks.” I groaned.

Geraldine produced a thermos from wherever she had it hidden on her body. How had I not noticed it before? “Tonight, before going to bed, I’m going to drink this. It’s a tea made from a blend marijuana, peyote, and ayahuasca. It’s a shamanic thing with no connection to the Judeo-Christian tradition that Baphomet belongs to. It taps into the older, pagan era when he was worshipped as a dark god. I’m going to drink this. Perform the ritual in the hell world itself, and free myself of this curse before helping you do the same thing.”

I was out of my depth. What she told me made no sense, but I could not deny the physical proof cut into my own hand. I wanted to deny it. I wanted to scream that it was all nonsense. I wanted to laugh and call it absurd. I wanted anything other than to admit the truth and face reality.

The reality is that I messed up big time. As big as anyone can mess up and not only was I paying for it, but so was my friend and classmate. And it was all my fault.

It was my fault for buying the idol in the first place. It was my fault for ignoring old man Gannon when he told me the idol was not for me. It was my fault for ignoring him again and not bothering to read the binder he gave me and warned me to read. It was my fault for letting Geraldine touch the idol after these previous faults. It was all mine, and I hated it, but I was impotent to do anything about it.

Geraldine drank her potion and went to bed in my dorm that night. I don’t know what she did, but my own dreams were peaceful at first. They were nothing more than the ordinary, meaningless drivel of a mind sorting out what it had been taking in.

Then, at the end, everything shifted suddenly, and I found myself in Baphomet’s throne room once again. I saw him lift Geraldine up with one clawed hand until she was left dangling over the edge of the throne. She gasped as she clawed futilely at his iron grasp. He spoke in that same strange language, his deep voice resonating throughout the room and my own body and mind.

I could not understand the words themselves, but, somehow, I knew their meaning. “Failure. Now take your place forever!” Then there was great snap, and I saw Geraldine’s head suddenly coked too far to one side, her mouth hanging slack, staring straight ahead with lifeless eyes.

Baphomet turned his fell gaze upon me, and spoke again, and I knew, somehow, I knew, he was promising terrible, terrible things, and I would live long enough to regret my mistake before he took me to spend eternity at his side in Hell.

That was six days ago. At least, that’s what the calendar on my computer is telling me right now. My body is cut up and bruised, and I hurt to my very soul.

When I came to this morning, Geraldine was missing. There is only a bloodstain where she had lain to go to sleep that night. The idol is missing too. Where it went, I cannot know. Honestly, I hope Geraldine somehow survived, that my dream was a lie, and she took the accursed thing to destroy, or, failing that, hide it where no one will ever be cursed by its presence again.

But I don’t think that’s what happened. My head is filled with fuzzy visions of terrible deeds, seen through my own eyes, but as though I am merely an observer in my own body, like someone else was in control the whole time.

I went online and searched up the strange visions in my head, and they are all real. The murder of a family of five two days ago, slaughtered with such brutality that the cops are unsure if it was man or beast that did them in. the torture of a classmate out in the woods, left for dead once she was too weak from blood loss to scream anymore. A cinderblock dropped from an overpass, smashing the windshield of a passing car below, causing it to careen out of control and cause a forty-car pileup with over a dozen fatalities.

These visions, and more, so many more, were all true. The last six days have been marred by murder and mayhem, and I know that I am at the center of it all. These bloodstains on my clothes are not only my own. They are the blood of my victims, too many victims, and the memory of the atrocities I committed are coming back like a crashing wave.

The dreamlike fog I first saw them in, the faint whisp of a memory that first set to my task of researching them has been blown away. I know what I did. I know my crimes. I know that I was not in control of my own body as I committed them.

And I know that I liked them. God help me, I liked them.

I know I should turn myself in. I know I need to go to the police, confess, and have them throw in solitary confinement before I fall asleep again. But I can’t. I won’t.

My will is no longer my own. My will, my body, and my soul belong to Baphomet. I am his to do with as he pleases. Six days a week I am bound to labor for him. One day only, the Lord’s Day, I am free to do as I will.

Even if I wanted to, I don’t know if I could turn myself in. I don’t know if Baphomet would exert his will or influence to stop me. I am bound to him now, by blood I am bound, and nothing can change that now.

What I can do is tell my story. I can warn you that if you find the idol of Baphomet, do not take possession of it. Don’t even touch it. The binder with the protection ritual is gone now. Destroying it was the first thing I did when my master took over my body. Without it, you are as helpless to resist him as I was.

I know what I should do. I know I should go to the police. I know I should end myself if I don’t imprison myself. It’s the right thing to do, but the truth is, all I want to do is go to sleep and let my master take control for the next six days.

I just hope he doesn’t follow through on his threat and take me home. I know his intentions for my family, and I have seen his handiwork firsthand.
