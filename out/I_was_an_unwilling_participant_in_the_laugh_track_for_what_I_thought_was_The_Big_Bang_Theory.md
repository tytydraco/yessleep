“The Big Bang Theory?”

I was never a fan of the show and its laugh track. In fact, I was sure the laugh track was used as a torture method by the CIA to get people to talk. I could never understand how ANY of the plot was as funny as the laugh track made it out to be—and giving an episode the benefit of the doubt, I was right. 

I was in high school during its initial seasons airing, so I would come home to my dad watching re-run after re-run, and it drove me fucking crazy. He was partially deaf, so the volume was cranked all the way up—and due to my father and I not exactly being on the same page, he refused to turn it down. 

So, it was endless, and I mean ENDLESS re-runs of the same intro song and that monotonous canned laughter that took me right over the edge. 

When my best friend asked me to accompany her to participate in a re-recording of the show’s laugh track, my first visceral response almost sent me tumbling off my chair. Millie was being 100% serious and at first, I laughed out loud. I didn’t mean to, but the absurdity of becoming the very thing I despised sent hysterical giggles creeping up my throat. 

To combat this, I took another scorching sip of my coffee and tried not to look my friend in the eye. “You’re kidding,” I finally said, leaning across the table and lowering my voice into a hiss. “Wait, didn’t that end like three or four years ago?” 

There weren’t many customers at our regular café so late, so I was pretty comfortable doing a throw-your-head-back laugh. I don’t think I found what she was asking me funny, but more so the idea that after escaping it and moving out, I was being dragged back into the hell of that god-awful laugh track. And not just hearing it again, but becoming part of it?  

I waited for Millie to nod and smile like she was joking, but she just dropped her phone onto the table, anxiously sipping her latte. I had known Millie almost my whole life. She had pitched several bad ideas all the way through middle school and high school. 

“It’ll only last around two hours!” 

Millie’s smile was bright, but I could tell from her expression, the weird glitter in her eyes, that she would be benefiting more than me. I only had to raise my brow for her to cave. She picked up her phone and waved it in my face, and I only got a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it flash of her screen before she was pulling it away. Millie wrapped her fingers around her latte in its styrofoam cup. “Do you remember that influencer agency I’ve been trying to get into for like, ever?”

I nodded. “The shady one?”

"It’s not shady, it’s just not well known,” she said. “You need a password to actually see the content.”

“That’s exactly why they’re shady.” I pointed out. “Shouldn’t this ‘agency’ be openly looking for content creators instead of hiding in the shadows?”

She nodded. “Yes. But these guys are…” she trailed off, her lips quirking into a smile, that same far-away look taking over her expression. Ever since she became infatuated with the idea of joining this agency, Millie spaced out for more normal. In fact, if she was just looking at her phone and watching these so-called content creators, it was like she was in a trance.  “Special.”

I inclined my head. “In what way?”

When Millie dodged the question, instead pointing out a new follower on her notifications, my suspicion grew. I had an inkling where this was going, but still, I gestured for my friend to continue. 

Millie had been trying to be an influencer for a while now. It started pretty small with books. 

She bought a whole load of books, but quickly became overwhelmed by the fact that she would have to actually read said books. Millie loved reading, often dropping plans to hang out with me to revel in the latest Karen M. McManus book when we were growing up, but apparently, there were certain rules book influencers had to follow—kind of like a hive mind. If popular book influencers had a strong opinion on a certain book or author, that opinion became universal in the community. 

She made a TikTok about a series she had loved as a kid, only for her comments to be filled with anon accounts telling her to unalive herself because she didn’t share that certain opinion.  It’s not like the book or the author was bad—in fact, it was simply about the “I am not like other girls” trope which was popular when we were in high school. 

It was because she didn’t follow this hive mind in that community, blindly hating popular books for outdated tropes. Millie was naïve, admittedly, and wasn’t fully up to date on what the community liked and hated, so she took these comments to heart and deleted her account.  When that didn’t work out, she tried any and everything to get a decent number of followers in order to even be acknowledged by this agency. But apparently, she wasn’t exactly what they were looking for. She just got rejections in the form of shady-looking emails from an address that was clearly made up. When Millie showed me these emails, I couldn’t believe she was genuinely pursuing these guys. 

They might as well have had a banner at the bottom of the screen saying, “WE WILL SELL YOUR ORGANS.” 

But no matter what I said, and how many interventions I staged with various members of our friend group, also housemates of hers, it was a bad idea—Millie was completely smitten. I had given up trying to stop her when she made a point of ending our friendship if I continued to “react negatively” when she spent hours in her room modelling clothes and only got several likes or attempted a mukbang. I was always there on the other side of the camera trying to keep my mouth shut, but after watching her force three burgers into her mouth, I couldn’t stand it. But the thing is, I value our friendship. I love Millie. I love everything about her, and I didn’t want to lose her. So, what was I supposed to do?

Cave.

To keep the friendship between my best friend and me, I became her biggest (and only) fan. I liked and commented on her Instagram, shared her posts everywhere I could, and smiled through gritted teeth. “So, this agency,” I said, maintaining that exact smile so she didn’t get afraid that I was about to “act negatively” about this choice, “If I were to actually come with you and do whatever, what exactly will you get out of it?” I frowned. “And what does The Big Bang Theory have to do with it?”

Millie suddenly found great interest in her latte.

I leaned forward, unable to resist a relieved smile. “It’s got nothing to do with The Big Bang Theory, has it?”

“If I told you what we were really recording for, you would probably say no.”

“And you have thoroughly underestimated how much I hate that show,” I said with a smirk. 

When she didn’t say anything, I sighed. “It’s for that agency, right?”

Millie’s gaze remained pinned to grains on the table. “They’re offering audition places to people who volunteer to take part in their laugh track recording,” she murmured. “And it’s not even a proper audition. I just have to make a certain video, and then post it. 

Whoever has the most likes wins.” She lifted her head, her eyes glittering with a certain emptiness I couldn’t understand. It was only when Millie was staring at her phone when she looked at me like that. I imagined it like a creature was hiding in the depths of her iPhone, ominously sucking out her soul. 

Her lip quirked into its usual smile, but there was nothing past it except an almost feral desperation to be part of this no-name agency.  “Sooo, being my best friend, what do you say?”

“What do they want you to film?” I inquired, ordering another coffee. It was going to be a long night.

That’s… a secret,” she said. “We’re just going to record a laugh track.”

“Laugh track?” I frowned. “They’re an influencers agency, why do they want a laugh track?”

I didn’t get my answer until three days later en route to the recording. I didn’t exactly agree to it verbally, but there was no way I was letting Millie go on her own. If this was some kind of scam, I would be there right beside her to remind my best friend that violence was an option. The constant start and stopping of the bus was making me nauseous, and I instantly regretted joining her. In my head, I was already being slammed with different scenarios which all ended in the two of us either ending up dead and dismembered or in another country with our organs removed. Millie didn’t share my anxiety. 

In fact, she didn’t seem nervous at all. When I glanced at her she was practically vibrating with excitement, her gaze glued to her phone as usual. I had maxed out my phone battery trying and failing to reassure my roommate that we would be okay, and the only thing I could do was stare at the back of a woman’s head. I did get curious though, when Millie kept making squeaking noises and wiggling in her seat—what exactly she was so immersed in? I must have been staring at her because my friend finally looked up from her phone and tugged an earphone out. I noticed her quickly angle the phone screen so I couldn’t properly see it. I made a point of leaning forward with a smile. “Is this what the laughing-track recording is for?” I asked curiously, peering at what I could see on the screen. Millie quickly paused whatever she was watching and turned to me with a smile.

“Do you want to watch?”

I shrugged. “We have thirty minutes to kill and the movement of this bus is making me want to barf, so sure.”

When my best friend’s smile curved into a frown, I looked pointedly at her. “I still think this is a bad idea, you know.” I prodded the screen. “But I am intrigued about what has stolen my best friend.” I leaned forward, squinting. “What is this, a reality TV show?”

“No, it’s a stream.”

“Like, a Twitch stream?”

Millie shoved her phone in my face, and finally, I got a full look at whatever this thing was. At first glance, I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. The screen showed a teenage girl standing in front of a mirror in an over-the-top decorated bedroom.

It was pink. Very pink. There was more pink than I had ever seen in my life. Her bed was pink, the carpet and the rug, all the plushies lined up on also-pink pillows, and oddly, even the sides of the mirror. The girl herself looked around seventeen or eighteen but had the expression of a little kid. Her eyes were far too wide and bright, lips split into an almost unnerving grin.

She stuck her index in her mouth and made a point of showing all of her teeth and then nodding before canned laughter sounded, making me wince. Somehow, it sounded worse than the laugh track from The Big Bang Theory. This laughter was almost pained. Millie laughed along, giggling at parts that weren’t funny. The girl ran downstairs into the kitchen, and there was a close-up shot of the knife drawer. More laughter. The girl started towards it in slow strides before whipping her head back at the call of her name. Elle. 

Before I could ask questions, Millie dragged the recording forward. To my surprise, this thing seemed to be an actual stream filmed professionally. But when I asked my friend what streaming service it was on, she just shushed me, her smile growing as wide as the girl’s. Whatever Millie was watching was exactly like a teen movie; the whole, ‘getting ready for school and rushing down the stairs for breakfast.’ I started to get bored three minutes in. 

“So, it’s like a stream, but more of a live feed?” Millie whispered. “It follows this girl in a town without rules. She’s coming up to her eighteenth birthday, aaand she’s the only one who hasn’t..” Millie trailed off with a giggle.” I nodded at her to expand, but she wasn’t looking at me. This was what she was obsessed with? I don’t know what I was expecting but this wasn’t it. I was just watching a teen movie—and a bad one. 

After the girl had hugged her smiley mother goodbye and rushed out into her front yard, something did prick my attention. White picket fences. Blue sky. The sun shining. I had seen enough movies and TV shows to know that this type of thing usually pointed to too much perfection—and there was already an eeriness in the way the camera kept going back to the knife drawer, almost as if teasing the viewer.

“What’s with the knife drawer?”

Millie only turned to wink at me. “You’ll see!”

When every neighbor waved hello, and the paper boy jumped off of his bike to personally greet the main girl with a grin, I realized I was right. This was either a satirical comedy or just plain bad. It reminded me of the start of a musical or an SNL sketch that had stuck in my mind. The only thing these people weren’t doing—thankfully—was singing and dancing. 

Though I wouldn’t have been surprised if they suddenly burst into song. It definitely had that kind of atmosphere as Elle strode down the sidewalk, grasping her backpack straps. 

It hit me suddenly that this place looked like modern-day 2023 but there was no technology.  I expected Elle to pull out her phone, but she just kicked through dead leaves and smiled at the sky with a not-quite-there smile. Millie nudged me, her eyes wide, almost unseeing, on the screen. “It’s coming up to my favorite part!”

“I don’t understand,” I said. “Is this some kind of satirical comedy?” I had to admit, I was getting intrigued. Because the further this girl wandered from her white-picket-fence neighborhood, did cracks start to slowly form in this seemingly perfect façade she had built around herself. Or maybe the town had built it around her.  

The sky, once bright blue when she was swallowing yummy pancakes and laughing at her mom’s jokes, started to… well, not darken. 

I don’t think darken is the word. A single cloud appeared. It wasn’t grey or stormy or held any weight, but one cloud in a perfect sky, along with constant shots of Elle’s grinning face and unblinking eyes, was oddly terrifying. 

But somehow, the laugh track continued on, just laughing hysterically at this girl who was oblivious to the world beginning to crumble around her very slowly. The knife drawer started to make more sense as the stream continued on. I noticed Millie was practically trembling with excitement. 

Elle stepped on something, and the *crunch* went right through me, sending shivers creeping down my spine. Millie was glued to the screen, though her smile has twisted and contorted into an almost feral grimace—like she was both anticipating and dreading what happened next. Elle didn’t look down at what she had stepped on, simply stepping over it with a laugh, motivated by the laugh track. 

The camera followed the sky first, more clouds forming as she got closer and closer to the town centre, perfection morphed into devastation. I saw it first in the crumbling buildings tipped over in the distance, the town clock tower slightly tilted at an angle, and a sharp lash of wind whipping leaves into Elle’s face. 

Which the invisible audience found hilarious. Elle skipped past a store with a shattered window, and slowly, very slowly, the camera began to show blood spatters which started small and barely noticeable, before stretching to pooling scarlet seeping on the sidewalk underneath piles of bodies contorted and mangled without their heads. Something cold and slimy crept up my throat, but I couldn’t look away. I tried to lurch away, a shriek culminating in the back of my throat. Mille was smiling widely at me, her eyes sparkling. “Keep watching!” she whispered excitedly. 

And somehow I did. Elle, now fully aware of what was going on around her, sometimes stepping over corpses and other times stamping on their heads, the sound of crunching bones and shredded flesh squelching under her feet—kept going until she was standing in front of a high school which seemed to be the only thing left standing in the town.

Whatever this sickening idea of a reality TV show was, somehow the high school was the only thing left standing in this dystopian world.

Finally, I managed to coerce speech. “Is this… real?” I whispered. My mouth was dry and I wanted to look away, I wanted to take my friend’s phone from her hands and throw it out of the window. This despair I was seeing, the pain and anguish of this dying town and its residents filled me with a feeling I didn’t understand. It was so vivid, I felt like I was there with them.  

I felt ridiculous for even asking, but what I was looking at looked real. The sharp, intense red of blood seeping across rough granite and shredded and decomposing flesh on every sidewalk, a whole town of corpses— looked real. 

I wasn’t sure even a Hollywood production company could do that good effects. 

There was too much detail in every corpse, every shattered skull and dried pieces of brain matter, every mangled limb, for it not to be real. When I looked at my friend for an answer, she paused and pulled a face like she didn’t know, before shaking her head and reassuring me this was all fake, and the production quality was due to several billionaires funding whatever this thing was. I finally started to understand how Millie had been completely enthralled in this stream, or whatever it was.

I don’t know if it was the contrast of Elle’s seemingly perfect character in a decrepit and broken society or the constant feeling that I was going to see something even more horrifying as she got further down the walk, and the state of the town became more evident in ignitions of fires in the distance and an overturned school bus. 

In a fucked-up way, or at least whatever was seeping into my brain and taking hold, told me what I was seeing was… beautiful. It was horrifying, yes. But the attention to detail and the color of fire and smoke in the air were captivating in ways I couldn’t fully understand. 

I couldn’t look away. I found myself glued to the screen, the footage creeping into my mind and twining its way around my brain. I was aware of the bus ride, but reality was starting to blur around me while fiction blossomed in front of me in clarity. Suddenly, it was my world which was the dull grey and the black and white, the monotonous drone of normal life, while the stream was exploding in color.

I saw it in Elle’s hair, which seemed brighter, blonder, twirling in an invisible breeze. 

The bodies she continued to stamp on, the stream of red staining every corner as she danced up the steps leading to the entrance to her high school—was somehow vivid and eye-catching, pooling in every crevice. Millie nudged me when Elle pushed the doors open with a childlike giggle, much to the delight of the invisible audience.

“Okay, so I know you’re watching like a thousand streams in, but recently, the town was taken over—and everything just kinda crumbled.”

“What?” I hissed. The bus hit a pothole, and I thwacked my head on the window, reality bleeding back into fruition. I couldn’t believe how far into this stupid stream I’d gotten. “You’re telling me they weren’t hit by a nuclear bomb and wiped out?”

Millie hummed. “Well, yes, you could call him a bomb, I guess?”

*“Him?”*

“Oooh, we’ll get to him soon! He’s my favorite,” Millie chuckled. “Actually, I’m pretty sure he’s everyone’s favorite. Everyone thinks he and Elle are like, so cute together. Before the escape streams, he was actually hated for being boring. And he was SO boring. The guy was supposed to be a total psycho, like JD from Heathers, and he was a bore. He was at the top of the polls to get kicked from the stream,” her lips quirked. “After the escape stream and a brief hiatus, he returned to Brightwood and turned the town upside down. And I mean brutally. He took down hordes of people, slaughtering classmates—even his own parents! This boy tore off his dad’s head with a chainsaw!” 

Millie was getting progressively more excited, wiggling in her seat, and I wondered if she was anticipating this mystery guy’s appearance. So far, I felt like I was watching a Twitch stream mixed with Lost. Millie elbowed me. “Yesterday, they tore down the school together so what we’re watching now is the aftermath.”

“Uh-huh.” I tried to share her enthusiasm, but an unwelcome feeling was twisting in my gut and creeping across the bare flesh of my arms, the phantom legs of a spider entwined around my spine. “And what exactly is the escape stream again?”

“I’ll get to it!” Millie seemed delighted I was asking questions—but I think I was more horrified than intrigued.

“So, this girl is clearly a psycho. She’s trampling over bodies."

Millie shook her head. “No, she’s not a psycho. But ever since she returned from hiatus, it’s like she’s acting like everyone else now. Elle used to be the only one who hadn’t killed anyone. She was like the only kid in her school who didn’t have The Urge, and half of her classmates already had multiple kills. There’s this one kid who killed seven kids before he turned eighteen--"

I cut her off, waving my hands. Millie was talking too fast for my coffee-drunk mind to understand. “I’m sorry, the what?”

“It’s called The Urge.” Millie looked at me like I was the crazy one before her lips spread out into a grin. “Oh, I didn’t tell you!” Her eyes flicked to and from the screen, following the camera movements. Elle was making her way down the main school hallway, stepping over lockers that had tipped over, and the corpses of students and teachers who all had something in common. I noticed it when I looked closer. They all had giant, gnawing crevices in their heads. Like someone had pierced them right through the skull. 

“Okay, so the whole thing started with Elle, and she was just a normal girl, right? But she lived in a town with no rules, so murder was legal. That goes for everything. Strangling, decapitation, cannibalism…” Millie’s eyes were bright with every word that slipped from her tongue, her finger hovering over the phone’s screen shaking with excitement, presumably ready to pause at the best parts. “Elle was the only one who had not yet killed anyone—like anyone,” Millie rolled her eyes. “So lame. I think she represented the last hope the town had, you know? Before she gave in to it too.”

“Gave into what?” Fully enthralled now, I watched the girl traipse through the hallway, swaying from side to side like she was drunk. 

“The Urge,” Millie murmured. “The last time we saw Elle as herself, she was following crazy Annalise into the forest,” she caught my eye. “Annalise was the resident psycho bitch. She went through the urge, but instead of killing anyone, she just broke down. Well, a few months ago, Elle was dragged into the forest by Annalise, who like, totally insisted something was going on in the town, and they were being watched. We still don’t know who was watching them, or stalking them, or whatever. Annalise didn’t exactly elaborate. She just said there were people in the walls.” 

Tapping  pause on her phone screen, she twisted to me. “Spooky, right? Well, after that the stream just ended. The next day, Elle was nowhere to be seen—and they focused more on a group of kids in a different class which was like, so boring.” She blew a raspberry. 

“Eventually, they did start to release extra content which was staged kind of like an escape? Elle almost escaped before she was betrayed in the betrayal of ALL betrayals!” Millie shook her head with a laugh. “I was on the edge of my seat! I really thought she was going to get away, but the person she had trusted the whole time turned out to be playing her like a fiddle. It was crazy. They were getting millions of views for this extra content, and it just got better when Elle turned into a different person. She completely broke apart when she realized everything which was happening was supposed to happen, and the people who were helping her were only moving along the fake narrative in her head,” 

My friend giggled. “I think I’ve watched the betrayal scene like a thousand times. It only gets better the more I watch it and if I go back, it foreshadows the betrayal very subtly.”

“So, this was all extra content and not actually on any streams?” I asked.

“Nope!” Millie scrunched up her nose. “They should have made it public to everyone because it’s some of their best content. I still think they should take the betrayal off of Patreon. You can watch it if you really look for it, but some people are missing out on lore. Like, they know nothing about the crazy escape streams or the time when Elle and Kaz killed that FBI informant.”

“This town has lore?” I couldn't resist a snort.

Millie grinned. “Brightwood has always had lore! Kaz has a whole history…” she trailed off. “I’ll get to that, but it’s kind of gross.”

“In what way?”

Millie sighed. “Okay, so if you dig deep enough into this stream’s history, it gets more fucked up the more info you find. There’s been  tonnes of speculation and evidence to back it up that several of the people in the town were brought up to be killers.”

“In a town where murder is legal and everyone is a psycho killer?” I rolled my eyes. “That’s surprising.”

Millie looked like she might saying something, opening her mouth, before smiling widely and nodding. “Yeah! Ignore me, I’m just nervous about the recording.”

“Who’s betrayed her?” I was vaguely aware we were nearing our destination, and I had become inexplicably drawn to this stupid stream.

The bus came to a startling halt, and I realized we were at our stop. Still, though, I wanted to stay where I was, but Millie was already rushing down the aisle, eagerly grabbing my sleeve and pulling me off the bus. When my shoes hit the ground, my head spun. 

I found myself baffled by normal life around me, the commute bustling past me and traffic flying past in a blur.  This specific part of the city was the more… bougie, compared to the student neighborhood I was used to. I found myself drinking in the kind of houses I would never be able to afford.  Millie was already power-walking down the sidewalk. 

It’s down here!” she said excitedly, “Come on!” 

When I joined her, she shoved her phone in my face. “So, I’ll be quick because we need to get to the recording, but this guy?” she prodded the screen. I couldn’t see him clearly because of the sun’s glare,  but I could just about make out a figure joining Elle, wielding a baseball bat. “That’s who betrayed Elle and got her caught.” She shot me a grin. “Kaz Issacs. It's very friends to enemies to lovers–maybe."

Peering at the screen, I couldn’t see anything. The sun was too bright. Before I could snatch the phone from her and see for myself, a feral desperation taking over me that I didn’t understand, Millie pocketed it with a sigh. “We can watch it later!” she tugged me into a half-run. Millie was acting like we were late when we were in fact early. 

I wasn’t expecting the place to resemble an actual agency, but when my friend pulled me through automatic doors and I made a deal of pointing out how fancy everything was—like an architect’s wet dream--  she shook her head and pointed to a door at the very back. Compared to the modern aesthetic of the main reception area, the door looked straight out of a horror movie.  “Darkroom are through there.” That was I pulled back and refused.

Millie just rolled her eyes. “Trust me, it looks better on the inside, I promise.”

“Darkroom?” I hissed. “That’s what they’re called?”

“Relax!” she laughed, entangling her fingers with mine. “You trust me, right? They’re literally just an influencer agency, there’s nothing nefarious going on.”

Somehow, she was right.

What I expected to be a serial killer’s lair was a small room with minimalist decoration, a receptionist sitting behind a MacBook. Millie handled everything, signing us in and giving our names and details. According to the receptionist who pointed through a set of doors, they were getting ready to start the recording. Millie took this as, “They’re started and you’re late” and freaked out, dragging me through the door and straight into… red. I’m not sure how to describe this room, except with varying shades of red. When I turned to my friend, her whole face was bathed in red light which reflected in her eyes, alleviating her smile. I got that feeling again, the shivers down my spine. 

But I shook it away. This place seemed legit, and as much as I hated the idea of my best friend being scammed or exploited, I wanted it to be real so she could reach her dream.  The room reminded me of a movie theatre with people already sitting in their seats and anxiously muttering to each other.  According to the receptionist’s instructions, we had to find our allocated seats—and when we were given the order, we had to… laugh. That was it. There was a large cinematic screen set up in front of us, so I figured that is what we would be watching.

“Are you excited?” Millie leaned over and whispered to me when I was feeling the exact opposite—especially when a guard strode in before locking the door behind him.

I twisted behind me, and there was an exit door at the back.

“Can everyone please place their arms on the armrest please?” A voice suddenly came through the speakers, sputtering in static.

Following everyone else, including my best friend, I rested my arms on the plush armrests.

“Clara.”

Millie’s voice was different, somehow. She was giggling. “Remember when I said I would do anything to be an influencer?”

In front of me, the screen flickered onto a red screen. The startling color matched the lights, and I found myself once again unable to look away. Things started to go very slowly after that. I remember something metal creeping over my wrists, pinning them to the armrests. “What?” I managed to get out as the screen switched from that startling reddish blur to a deeper shade, which twisted me inside and out. My words didn’t sound or feel real.  

I could already feel it. Just like the stream that Millie showed me, this thing was alive, entwining inside me and numbing my lips, contorting my thoughts. But unlike the stream which forced me to think of words like beautiful and horrifying, pushing me to enjoy what I was seeing, this thing plunged through my skull. I could feel it, the phantom blade of a knife cracking open my skull and releasing me to swimming red, which was suddenly directly in front of me, pouring into my mouth and choking me, drowning me. I screamed, opening my mouth, but the screech clawing at the back of my throat twisted into something else. Laughter. I was laughing-- and I was barely aware of it until I could feel my body straining against the metal around my wrists, throwing me back and forth as hysterical screeching laughter poured from me. 

I felt it like blood seeping down my lips and chin, my eyes widening, unblinking, straining to stay open while this thing took me. It wasn't going to let me go. I could it worming its way through me, setting fire to every nerve ending, plunging my thoughts into endless fog I couldn't claw away from. The screeching of hysterical and pained laughter filled the room, rattling in my skull. I don’t know how I got loose. Maybe I clawed at the metal around my wrists until I was bleeding, screaming into the growing void inside my head. Or maybe I just got lucky. 

The world spun around me, and I was still laughing, shrieking into my blood-spattered hand as I hit the ground on my knees, and crawled past others who had succumbed to the red, reduced to twitching limbs contorting in their seats. I couldn’t hold it back, the thing in my throat, in my chest and gut, and brain—the thing twisting my body into its very own canned laughter. 

There was no guard at the back, and I left them. I left Millie. There was a woman right at the back, who I almost grabbed and took with me. She was crying. Tears streamed down her face as she laughed. But her eyes were wide with terror. She was laughing herself to death. 

Laughing until her brain exploded through her head, and yet her body hit the ground and its mangled mouth continued. I was vaguely aware that my mouth was filled with blood, and whatever had been done to me had almost ejected my organs through my lips. 

The further I got away from the screen, it got somehow better, but whatever it was which had grasped hold of me wasn’t letting go. Through the door at the back, I expected a way out. But what I was instead greeted with, were clinical white hallways which reminded me of a school. I started down the hallway on my hands and knees, squeezing my lips together to avoid making noise. 

There was a hazy red mist over my eyes. When I was slowly getting to my feet, pressing my hand over my mouth to stop another fit of giggles escaping my lips, the door at the end of the hallway swung open, a shadow slipping into startling white. Through the scarlet haze over my eyes, I couldn’t make out an identity.

The shadow started to run towards me, and I reeled back on my hands. I tried to crawl back, but it ducked, ice-cold hands wrapping around my wrist and pulling me to stumbling feet. Now that I was face to face with the shadow, the silhouette, it had a face. It was a guy. Seventeen or eighteen. Dark brown hair, blood-spattered cheeks, and a wide grin stretching across bloody lips. 

His smile, however, did not match his eyes. He was terrified, a cavernous darkness I didn't want to even begin to understand. I had never seen someone so scared, and yet so exhilarated, so severed from sanity, that he was left a splintered puppet with no direction, no thoughts of his own except… run.

The guy gestured behind him at what I guessed was the exit before the door he'd come from flew open once more, this time a girl stepping over the threshold. I recognized her the second the dull red haze faded from my vision. 

Elle. 

But it wasn’t the Elle I’d seen on the stream, because that girl seemed at least a little human, despite her clearly deteriorating mental state. Her smile matched the guy’s, and I realized they too had been through whatever was inside that room of red. No. 

No, they had been through much worse. I saw it in the hollowness in Elle’s eyes, vacancy in her smile. Before I could fully drink in this girl and try to figure out what had happened to her, what had turned her into this shell—I was being dragged backward by the boy. I thought Elle would pursue us, but she just stood with her arms folded, that eerie grin still splitting her lips apart. When cool air finally grazed my cheeks, the boy dragged me through a fire door into the parking lot, I couldn’t breathe. I dropped to my knees, and pressed my face into concrete, sucking in precious air.

I wasn’t laughing anymore, but I could still feel it inside me, phantom laughter writhing through me.

It took me half a minute to regain myself, and a further to realize the boy who saved me (and himself?) was way too quiet.

And when I lifted my head, finding myself face to face with him wielding a metal pipe, I understood why. I had enough time to open my mouth before darkness swallowed me up. I didn’t even remember him hitting me. I woke up to laughing—the boy’s laughing. But it sounded strangely distant, like ocean waves. Far away, and yet also close. 

He almost sounded like static.  I was moving, my head pressed against the cool pane of a car window. It was dark outside, and next to me, the boy was curled up on the seat, roaring with laughter. When I lifted my head, I glimpsed a middle-aged man in the driving seat. “Miss, can you shut him up?” The man groaned. “Jesus fucking Christ, he’s been laughing for over an hour. Has the kid taken something?”

Pulling away from the window and the pool of drool I’d found myself in, I tried to coerce words into my mouth which wasn’t screaming.

“Where are we?” I managed to whisper.

“Coming out of the city,” the man said. “Before the kid went fucking insane, he told me to get as far away from there as possible.”

I nodded, swallowing hard. “And… what’s his name?”

“Felix, or something like that. I don’t care. Can you stuff something in his mouth? He’s driving me crazy. He needs to stop laughing like that, or he’s getting out. The laughing is getting old. If he were my son, I would have kicked him out by now.”

“Laughing?”

I turned to the guy, and sure enough, he was kicking his legs, his mouth wide open in a hysterical shrieking laugh, but I couldn’t hear it.

There was something smudged under his elbow, and I grasped for his writhing arm, pulling up the sleeve of his shirt.

PRTY OF D A ——--O O M

“What’s that?” The driver murmured. “Some kind of tattoo?”

Before I could respond, the Uber driver’s expression seemed to twitch in the car mirror—from an annoyed frown to a sudden smile splitting his lips apart. I didn’t hear him start to laugh, but I could see the jolt in his body and chest, his head smacking into the back of his seat. When his hand left the wheel, the car was careening forwards. I don’t remember the crash, just the aftermath. Luckily, I wasn’t injured, and neither was the guy, who was somehow still giggling when I slipped back to consciousness, finding myself being strangled by my seatbelt. 

The car had flipped over. The boy was faced down on the ground, and from the manic trembling of his body, he was laughing. 

But he wasn’t the only one. When I twisted my head, I glimpsed a long stretch of scarlet, which was almost Brightwood red, bleeding across the road. The Uber driver wasn’t so lucky, his decapitated corpse lying mangled in the middle of the road, while his head, I could glimpse it near me, twitching like it was still connected to its body. No, because it was laughing. Just like the boy curled into the ground, the severed head’s mouth was wide open, dead eyes unseeing, while his mouth continued to work, continued to laugh and laugh and laugh.

I crawled out of the wreck and got as far away from there as possible, as soon as headlights started to appear in the dark, heading straight for us.

As soon as we were discharged from the hospital,  I’ve taken this guy back to my apartment and he’s staying with me while I try to figure out what the fuck is going on. I don’t trust him going with anyone else, and I’m pretty sure he belongs to some kind of organization. Darkroom, if I had to guess. 

Someone is watching us. 

There has been a black SUV outside for almost twelve hours. This guy is completely out of it—and when he’s conscious, he’s laughing. I have noticed something though. When he laughs, his mouth widens almost inhumanly, and I can see something attached to his back tooth. It’s like an implant?

It’s silver, like a [filling.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/120xf14/in_my_town_of_brightwood_pines_murder_was_legal_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) 

Should I get this thing out? Is that what is causing this laughing?
