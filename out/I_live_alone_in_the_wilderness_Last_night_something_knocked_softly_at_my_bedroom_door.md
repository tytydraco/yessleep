I jolted upright.

Stale air escaped my lungs in quick, shuddering bursts. Adrenaline surged through my newly awakened veins, pulsing its manic rhythm into the back of my eyes - the familiar war drums of an approaching panic attack.

Across the room, the door sat quietly in the darkness.

*There was no knock. It was just a dream.*

*Calm down.*

*You need to calm down.*

My ears perked, searching for noise.

Ancient floorboards groaned as they teetered over their termite-stricken support beams.

Wind howled through the valley, causing some loose rain gutters to clink rusty metal against the rafters.

A gag bubbled across the back of my tongue, imagining the filthy, contaminated air pawing at the sides of my house, painting the stone veneer pitch-black with its disease, its pesticides, its toxic emissions and its cancerous oxides.

But that was it.

*See? No more knocks, because no one’s here, because no one can be here. Also, why would anyone even bother breaking in? For your vast riches? For you? Give me a break.*

Still, my buzzing nerves refused to settle.

I swung my jittery, sweat-caked legs over the edge of the mattress, sighed, and raised both hands in front of my chest.

*Three quick taps to the right collarbone. Three long taps to the left collarbone. A final three quick ones on the right. Inhale, exhale.*

**Tap-tap-tap. Tap...tap...tap. Tap-tap-tap. Breathe in, breathe out.**

It was the last vestige of therapy I’d managed to hold on to.

**Tap-tap-tap. Tap...tap...tap. Tap-tap-tap. Breathe in, breathe out.**

Always soothing, always centering. With every repetition, my mind cooled. The pattern never failed to bring me home.

Then, gently, almost lovingly:

**Knock-knock-knock.**

I stared at the door.

**Knock...knock...knock.**

Suffocation seared deep gashes into the base of my throat.

**Knock-knock-knock.**

The latch bolt clicked, and it creaked open.

Not fully.

Only an inch.

I froze. My wild heart thumped, marching along the underside of my sternum, battering its cartilage, threatening to spring from the confines of my rib cage like the jester of a blood-drenched jack-in-the-box.

*The nearest house is ten miles away.*

*None of the alarms went off.*

*Who the fuck is standing out there?*

A series of dull, sluggish thuds emanated from the hallway, quieter and quieter as the seconds crawled on. Not exactly footfalls. The noise was muddy. It lacked discreteness: no separation of one foot from the next. The thuds were more like an overfilled burlap sack being heaved across the floor, items audibly shifting within the coarse fabric with each pull.

My bulging eyes remained fixed on the moon-touched darkness spilling in from the cracked doorway.

I shifted forward. The wood was cold on the balls of my heels, biting at the exposed skin. I stood. A long, shuddering moan exploded from the plank bowing under my weight.

My entire body tensed. Psychic pain ran dizzying laps along the length of my spine, up and down, up and down.

I listened.

I waited.

Silence.

A razor-sharp vacuum of sound.

Then, from a further distance: the knocks. Same pattern. *My* pattern: tainted, defiled, bastardized.

Then, the thuds resumed.

I bent over, drew an aluminum baseball bat from under my bed, and crept towards the door. Pearly moonlight trickled across the room, filtering through the pines outside my second-story bedroom window, manifesting a dancing panorama of ghostly shapes as the branches wavered in the wind.

I *could* have escaped, right then and there.

I *could* have opened the window, climbed down the tree, and sprinted through the forest in the direction of the nearest highway.

Hell, I *could* have just jumped. The ground wasn’t that far. Good odds I would’ve limped away with a few bumps and bruises, nothing more.

It wasn’t an option.

*I’d rather die than leave this house.*

I flattened myself against the wall and peeked my eyes over the doorframe.

A large, amorphous shadow lingered motionless at the end of the hall. They were wide enough to fill the hallway, but short, barely tall enough to rise above the railing. Jagged edges protruded all along their silhouette: from their thick torso, from their broad shoulders, from their slender, box-shaped head - everywhere. A malformed clump of black fangs on an ominous patrol.

I squinted. Cocked my head side to side.

*What in God’s name are they wearing?*

Halfway between us, a narrow beam of moonlight descended, illuminating a column of dust in its angelic glow. My gaze drifted upwards. I threw my hand over my mouth and wrenched my head from the doorway. A wail churned in my throat. I fought desperately to keep the noise contained.

There was a small, circular hole in my roof.

The perimeter was compromised.

My hand fell from my lips. I grasped my chest, practically clawing at its bones. My lungs became a bonfire.

*I’m already breathing it in. I can feel it sinking into me, chewing on my scars. I’ll be wheezing soon. Then the gnawing breathlessness, and then...*

A phantom sensation took hold of me.

It was the feeling of a tube sliding down my throat, icy plastic compressing my airway, overriding my will, forcing gulps of filthy atmosphere inside of me before promptly sucking it all out, every single scrap of oxygen until my lungs deflated like a balloon.

My fingers, on autopilot, guided solely by muscle memory, rose to tap my collarbone.

They only collided once:

**Knock.**

The sound was impossibly resonant.

I snapped.

I scrambled over to my nightstand, bare feet slamming into the wood. The bat fell from my sweaty hands. The hollow metal collided with my bedframe, and a high-pitched, melodic clamor tore through the room. Coughing, I ripped the drawer off its hinges and sent it crashing to the floor. Pens and hard candies and loose change scattered around me as I dug through its contents, stopping only when I found what I was searching for: a facemask and a roll of heavy-duty tape.

I threw the mask on and stomped into the hallway, my mind a hazy, screaming blur. The ceiling was thankfully low. I lifted myself onto the treacherously slim railing that overlooked my foyer, reborn as a living paradox - driven utterly fearless under the influence of mind-shattering fear.

My trembling hand reached towards the hole in the ceiling. Steam gathered around its perfectly circular, concrete margins, but the air wasn’t hot against my fingertips; it was painfully cold, downright glacial. I slammed a torn edge of tape into the stone.

It was mushy. Gelatinous. A chunk of concrete was displaced upwards by my meager touch.

Disbelief roared through my body.

The piece of tape didn’t stick. Instead, it fluttered down, swaying delicately, a falling leaf in a bitter November wind. My other hand stretched to catch it.

I slipped.

I could see up through the hole as I fell.

There was an unnaturally bright, yellow-tinged star in the night sky: a shimmering speck of amber bejeweling the firmament.

The back of my head smashed into something hard.

A blip of pain,

then everything turned black.

\- - - - -

I had the strangest dream.

It’s 2021.

I’m back in New York City, entombed in a sleek, minimalist apartment high above the city streets. I’ve been out of the hospital and off the ventilator for a few months, maybe half a year. I’m staring outside, petrified by the disorder, the raw chaos of it all. My dread calcifies into swathes of tiny, pus-stained crystals, clogging the arteries that feed my heart, causing the vessels to swell painfully in my chest.

I start tapping on my collarbones.

Craig sneaks up behind me.

He startles my frayed nervous system.

I jump, twisting around to face him. My ex-husband is rolling an overstuffed suitcase behind him. Dirt-stained socks and books dog-eared with hundred-dollar bills are leaking from small slits in the front zipper. I’m not sure why I didn’t hear him approach. The wheels of the suitcase rattling against the tile are borderline deafening.

Once again, he chastises me. Says something like:

“If you’re dead-set on living the rest of your life as a fuckin’ germaphobe, the least you could do is keep the apartment clean.”

I correct him, coldly, clinically - the way I wanted to correct him when it really happened.

“I’m not really germaphobic. Broadly speaking, I’m agorophobic. If you want to be more precise, I guess you could label me ‘aerophobic’, though that usually refers more to a fear of flying in a plane, rather than a fear of the air itself...”

He waves a dismissive hand in my general direction and turns to walk away.

Craig doesn’t get very far.

After a few steps, his body melts.

The man completely liquifies into a puddle of molten skin and soggy clothes. No skeleton is left behind. The handle of the suitcase flops onto the human reservoir with a wet smack.

I’m upset, I think. Something close to upset. At the very least, I feel decidedly alone.

But not for long.

The puddle quivers. Convulses like there’s an earthquake in the distance.

The steaming fluid springs to life.

It snaps up, congeals to everything around it, and begins to animate...

\- - - - -

I jolted upright.

My back muscles lamented the sharp movement, crying out in agony. I winced. My skull throbbed something vicious. Hot, labored breaths pushed against the inside of the facemask.

The coffee table broke my fall.

The house was dark. Every room was quiet.

No thudding,

no tapping,

and no knocking.

I hoisted myself off the fractured glass top and stood. Nagging shards dug playfully into my heels. The pain barely registered.

*Was anyone ever really here?*

I pivot my aching neck. Judging by the bleary green dot aside the front door, the alarm system was still primed. All five deadbolts remained tightly latched, silver chains curling between the door and its frame, twinkling in the moonlight.

*Moonlight...*

I swung forward, eyes wide, knees weak, nearly toppling face-first into the shattered remains of my coffee table before catching myself.

And there it was.

A single, quiet beam of moonlight streaming through the enigmatic hole in my ceiling, skewering my perfect bastion like a spear through the gut. My eyes traced its descent. The same beam glittered silently in my first-floor restroom.

*Something plummeted through the roof, but, Lord, how far down did it go?*

I limped over to the open door and flicked the light switch. The trajectory was clear. Whatever fell, it plunged through the ceiling, through the upstairs floorboards, and finally through the basin of my shower, a few inches from the drain.

Everything around the point of impact had changed.

Or, more accurately, was *still* changing.

A bevy of white acrylic cysts encircled the small hole. Most were the size of a tennis ball, but the largest among them was nearly the size of a fire hydrant. Engorged and pulsing, a phosphorescent liquid dribbled from the cysts. A smaller one audibly popped as I observed them, releasing the liquid and a smoky, metallic scent into the air, like the aroma of a pork chop if you could grill it with gunpowder.

The hole continuously exuded wisps of steam.

I followed one of those wisps up the shower wall.

Right where the steam appeared to concentrate, a tuft of strawberry blonde hair grew from the tile, attached to the ceramic by what looked like a patch of scalp. Clearly, it was my hair. I'd lose a strand or two when I showered, but never a whole godforsaken tuft.

*God, Christ, I need to go.*

*But where* ***can*** *I go?*

I flicked the light switch off.

*I’ll just have to hide.*

Blackness enveloped me.

Then, to my right:

**Knock-knock-knock.**

I didn’t turn.

**Knock...knock...knock.**

I couldn’t bear to look.

**Knock-knock-knock.**

I just ran.

The foyer passed by in a messy haze. My body howled, each accumulated injury its own voice in the agonizing cacophony. The small of my back spasmed, the muscles kicking like a mule. Hot blood dripped down my pounding head wound. My lungs ignited. Viscous breath like coal smoke sputtered from my cracked lips.

The heaving thuds were only a few steps behind me.

I reached the door and started unlatching the deadbolts.

One. Two. Three.

**Thud. Thud. Thud.**

Four, and five, and -

**Thud.**

My hand gripped the knob.

I could open the door.

I hesitated.

God, I hesitated.

**Thud. Thud.**

The phantom tube began to slither down my throat once more. The icy plastic. The filthy, filthy atmosphere.

*TURN.*

*TURN YOUR GODDAMNED WRIST.*

**Thud.**

My hand fell from the knob.

I couldn’t bear it.

I just couldn’t bear it.

I turned around, put my back to the door, and slumped to the floor.

It was only a few feet in front of me.

A hallucinatory amalgam of steaming flesh and strawberry blonde hair, ornamented with random pieces of my home. They jutted from its corpulent center with no apparent order or intention. A faucet head from its left flank. Vinyl records fanning from its chest like an exotic bird puffing out its plumage. There was no head on its shoulders; only the narrow apex of an antique clock. As it thudded towards me, the fixture chimed four AM. The sound was muffled and coarse, emanating from within its shuddering hide.

It towered over me. Globs of the phosphorescent liquid drizzled at my feet, like it was slobbering. The amalgam's copious steam distorted the surrounding atmosphere.

I waited.

I braced for the end.

No end came.

It began sliding away from me.

The amalgam heaved forward a few inches, then paused. The faucet head swiveled, then protruded, revealing a length of red, spongy muscle driving the metal. The curve knocked a familiar pattern into a nearby wall.

*My* pattern.

Then, it started moving again.

*It doesn’t want to hurt me...it doesn’t want anything.*

*It’s aimless. No goal, no purpose, no point.*

*It’s just wandering.*

*Spinning its wheels.*

*Trapped.*

The parallel was hard to swallow.

Tears welled. I choked back a few sobs before tearing the mask from my face, launching it across the room. As my hand recoiled, I accidentally smeared a drop of the amalgam’s fluid onto my pinky finger.

The tingling only lasted for a second.

Then, I began changing.

A nub of malignant flesh burst from my pinky finger, shattering its nailbed. An overdue scream finally billowed from my chest.

It was another pinky finger, glistening with blood.

I sprang to my feet and sprinted into the kitchen. I placed my thumb into my palm and they congealed together. Additional fingers exploded circumferentially from my pinky, eviscerating the original digit. They pushed into each other with malignant indifference, growing, expanding, becoming a hellish latticework of oozing stumps. I didn’t bother with the lights, nor a cutting board. The change was spreading. I had no time.

I raised the butcher’s knife.

*You can choose to live.*

I raised the knife even higher.

*Or you can choose to let yourself die.*

The blade fell like an avalanche.

*Can’t have it both ways.*

**Clunk-clunk-clunk.**

A vortex of electric agony detonated across my wrist.

I screamed.

I screamed again.

There was warmth. Profuse, distressing warmth. Eventually, the static simmered.

When I could manage, I looked down.

It was done, and it seemed to have stopped the spread.

*Make a choice.*

I wrapped the wound best I could and left the writhing mass of fingers on the countertop.

Then, I sprinted for the door.

I twisted the knob,

took a deep, deep breath,

and tore[ it open.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)
