So to start I think I will share with you what I have written for my part to help you at the very least grasp what's happening with me and hopefully you guys will be able to help me somehow. I also would have to stay awake for as long as I can and you'll understand why after reading this. Well here goes nothing :   
  
Now, for my part I believe that it will be best for us to trace back what happened up until now as well as trying to understand the origin of this *thing*.

Okay, hear me out. We’ve been stuck in the same loop over and over again, but for some reason, I can't remember whatever happened during those days—except for yesterday **that isn't yesterday.**

The last thing I remember is talking to my parents about my college classes on the phone before hanging up and going to sleep.

At this point I am sure that you know why I am writing this, and you probably have a much better understanding of the situation than I do, but just for the sake of it lets try having an outside view of things.

For starters, I admit, I’m quite a paranoid person. Sometimes, I have this habit of putting my wallet inside my pillow since I grew up insecure about leaving important stuff out in the open. But now that I live alone in my one-bedroom apartment, I started putting it in my locker, under the sweatpants that I wear, so I don’t forget it when I go out.

I also check for cams in the shower **every day**. I keep every receipt from shopping for at least two months before throwing them away. I cover the cameras on both my phones and laptop. I **always** use a VPN whenever I browse the internet.

Is it extreme? **Maybe.** But this is how I grew up, which makes me even more certain about the situation I’m in.

So, according to what's written on the book that you are currently reading, I have been stuck here for minimum **70 days—since I am number Seventy**. My past selves were able to write down what they experienced, and the writing idea came from the first Emmel. He wrote, and I quote:

**For the Me of Tomorrow:**

"*I was sceptical at first, but now I don’t know if I’m being paranoid or if I’m onto something. See, I woke up with an intense stomach-ache, so I started searching for my credit card to go buy some medicine from the pharmacy. I started with my locker, but I couldn't find it, so I went to my second hiding place. I slipped my hand into my pillow and took it out, but something felt off—it had multiple scratches on it. The thing that made me even more curious was that only the first two numbers of my birth year—20 (since I was born in 2001)—were intact, and the same thing with the first three letters of my name:* ***EMM****.*

*At first, I didn't think much of it. But the pain worsened, so I went to my medicine cabinet where I keep all my pills. As I was reading the prescription on one of them, I saw something that made me forget about the pain.*

*There were three letters written in caps with scratches under them:* ***EMM****.*

*Now, maybe this was just a coincidence, but I tried something with the number 20. At first, I started counting from the first word of the prescription until I reached the* ***20th*** *word, which said:* ***"repeated."*** *Then I thought that wasn’t enough, so I counted* ***20 words from EMM*** *and found:* ***"days."*** *Then I counted* ***backwards from EMM*** *and found:* ***"you."***

*I spent the whole day trying to convince myself that it wasn’t a hint—just me being me—but the pain prevented me from thinking straight. So, I went back to bed and stayed up until approximately* ***9 PM,*** *which is when I’m writing this.*

*This might be the most edgy and weird thing that I ever did but if this is true then am a mastermind.*

*And for my future self—I left this book on the desk for you. If, for some reason, it remains intact after the loop, I’m counting on you to figure it out.*"

This guy is **crazy.**

That’s what I thought at first after reading his words. But then, as I continued, I realized that even with his far-fetched conclusion... he was onto something. Especially after what the **Second** and **Third** me had to say.

"*Okay, so I just came across what that maniac wrote and... I think he's right. I have no recollection of writing all of this, and I found the book exactly where he said it would be.*

*But I still doubt his theory, because contrary to him, I* ***didn't*** *wake up with a stomach-ache. Heck, I woke up feeling* ***great****—maybe the best I’ve felt in months. So, I’ll have to test this myself to see which of us is right.*

*For now, I’ll write in detail everything I did today, from waking up until now, which is* ***9:23 PM***…"

**Second Me** went on to describe his day: waking up, cleaning himself, preparing breakfast (2 eggs and bread with tap water since it was the only thing available to eat in the morning), then reading some books to prepare for the spring semester, lunch, diner etc... He specifically mentioned math books—**Chapter 2 and 3.**

Then, after taking a shower and as he was putting the books back on the shelf before going to sleep, he noticed the **diary** on the desk and decided to read it.

Then he also decided – just to be sure – to break the table and the chair that were in my kitchen leaving them for Third to check if they are still in the state that he left them in.

When I first read this, I was still sceptical of **Emmel 1’s** theory. My day didn’t go exactly like **Second’s**, but like him, I had no memory of writing any of this. I mean, the **diary** in front of me has **200 pages**—if I wrote something that long, there’s no way I’d forget about it.

Then I read what **Third Me** wrote.

That’s when I knew this was real.

"*Yep. I’m scared.*

*I had the same day as* ***Second****, but that’s* ***not*** *what’s scaring me. Normally, I don’t have a routine for my day—besides waking up and going to the bathroom to clean myself—so me doing exactly what he said is* ***very*** *unusual.*

*Also, if* ***Second*** *was right—and knowing myself—I should have* ***less*** *eggs in my fridge.*

*But right now, I’m staring at* ***18 eggs.*** ***Excluding*** *the ones I prepared this morning. Which means that only the two that I prepared this morning were used.*

*The same thing goes for diner. My freezer is empty as I just ate the chicken that I bought "yesterday," and my pack of rice was untouched until I opened it this afternoon.*

*I also read the same chapters that he did 2 and 3. But what scared me the most is that I found the chair and table that he said he broke, and they were intact.*

*So genuinely…* ***what in tarnation is happening*****?**"

Those were his last words.

I don’t know why he didn’t write more, but I **understand** him. I was also petrified after reading his paragraph. I checked my food supply, just like he did, and found it **intact.**

**Fourth** and **Fifth Me** didn’t say much apart from them checking the credit card and finding the same grazing and hints as **First**. They mostly kept writing about how **scared** they were. Their handwriting was barely readable, even for me.

But **Fifth Me** raised a **very** good point in the middle of his frenzy:

*"Why is the book the only thing that remains unchanged?"*

He’s **right.** Why doesn’t the resetting affect it too?

That’s when **Sixth Me** tried something new.

"*Let’s calm down a little bit now. This is new for me too, but we’ll just waste time if we keep freaking out.*

*I know it’s weird for me to write as "we," but if this is true, then it’s better to* ***live the scenario.***

***Fifth*** *gave me a good idea.*

*Now, I won’t harm the diary by any means, since it’s the only source of information that I have. But from what I read; it seems that the diary* ***always*** *remained on the desk.*

*So, I’ll change its location—put it on the shelf next to my college books—and see if it will spawn back in its place or not.*

*I know that I might never find it again, but I think it’s worth a shot*."
