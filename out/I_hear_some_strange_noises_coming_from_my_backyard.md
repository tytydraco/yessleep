 As I lay in my bed, trying to fall asleep, I couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was watching me. Every night, I would hear strange noises coming from outside, in my backyard. I tried to ignore it, thinking it was just the wind or my imagination, but the noises persisted. 

 I decided to investigate, so I sneaked out of my bedroom window and made my way to the backyard. As I reached my backyard, I saw something that I will never forget. I saw a figure standing in the shadows, watching me. I froze, my heart racing, I couldn't move, I couldn't scream. I quickly ran back inside and locked all the doors and windows, but I knew deep down inside that it wouldn't be enough to keep him out. 

 From that night on, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was being watched. I started to notice strange things happening in my backyard, like footprints in the mud and objects moved around. I started to feel like I was being stalked, like someone was always watching me. 

 I tried to tell my parents, but they didn't believe me. I was trapped, trapped in my own home with someone who was stalking me. I didn't know what to do, I was alone and I was scared. Every night I would lay in bed, eyes wide open, staring at the window, waiting for him to come back. But he never came back, I never saw him again, but I knew that he was still out there .

 As the nights went on, the feeling of being watched only intensified. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't focus on anything. I was always on edge, always looking over my shoulder. I started to notice more and more strange things happening in my backyard. Objects would disappear, only to reappear in different places. I even found strange symbols etched into the ground. 

 I tried to tell my parents again, but they still didn't believe me. They thought I was just imagining things, that I was being paranoid. I knew that I had to take matters into my own hands. 

 I set up a camera in my backyard, hoping to catch the stalker in the act. And one night, I finally got the evidence I needed. The camera caught a figure, shrouded in darkness, moving around in my backyard. I couldn't see his face, but I could tell that he was watching me. 

 I showed the footage to my parents, and finally, they believed me. We contacted the police, and they launched an investigation. But despite their best efforts, they were never able to find the stalker. 

 To this day, I still don't know who was watching me, or why. But I do know that I'll never be able to forget the feeling of being watched, and the terror of not knowing who or what was behind it. 

 I started to do some research on my own, trying to find any clues that might lead me to the identity of the stalker. I dug deeper into the symbols that were etched into the ground and found out that they were ancient symbols of protection. But I couldn't understand why they were there, who put them there and what they were supposed to protect me from. 

 I was constantly on guard, never alone. I always had someone with me, even when I went to the grocery store. I was too scared to be alone, too scared that the stalker would come for me. 

 One night, as I lay in bed, I heard a noise coming from outside. I immediately thought it was the stalker, but this time, I was ready for him. I grabbed a baseball bat and slowly made my way to the backyard. And there he was, the stalker, standing there in the shadows, watching me. But as I reached the backyard, there was no one there.  

 One day, I heard the news that someone had died a few blocks from my house. The details were sketchy, but it was enough to send shivers down my spine. Was it the stalker? I couldn't be sure.

 Years have passed since that night, I never heard or saw the stalker again, but the fear and the unknown still lingers. Even though I have moved on with my life, the memory of that night still haunts me.
