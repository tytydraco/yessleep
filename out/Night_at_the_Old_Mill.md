i never planned to take that path through the woods at night it was late and i was tired and the shortcut past the old mill seemed like my only option the road was cracked and overgrown and moonlight barely reached the ground i told myself it was fine that nothing could happen but deep down a knot in my stomach grew tighter with each step

the first sign something was wrong came as a soft scraping from the barn door to my right it sounded like nails dragging along wood i stopped and listened my heart pounding like a drum it paused then started again louder and more urgent i strained my eyes but saw nothing just the shadowed outline of rotten planks

i should have turned back but curiosity or fear held me there i crept closer to the door and felt a chill creep up my spine i could almost taste the cold stale air inside i pushed the door with a trembling hand and it swung open on its own with a long slow creak that echoed through my bones

inside the barn was darkness so dense it felt solid the smell of damp hay and rot filled my lungs i fumbled for my phone and flipped on the light the beam cut across broken planks and old barrels and then fixed on the far corner where a shape was huddled under tattered burlap the figure didn’t move or breathe at first then a low moan rumbled like distant thunder

i stepped forward and the burlap shifted and fell away revealing pale skin that glowed in the beam the eyes were wide unblinking and the mouth was twisted into a grin that felt wrong it wasn’t a human smile more like a torn ribbon spilling blood and dirt i froze as it pulled itself upright on all fours its arms too long and its fingers ended in sharp points than claws

a scuttling sound behind made me whirl around but there was nothing else i spun back and the thing was closer now its head cocked to the side like it was studying me its grin widening its eyes bored and hungry it tilted forward on its toes and hissed softly like a snake tasting the air

i backed up and the beam of light shook all around the walls danced with shadows the floor was slick with dark stains and patches of something i couldn’t name each step was wet and slippery and i twisted my ankle it gave way and i fell hard the phone skittered across the floor going dark

for a heartbeat i lay there the world silent then i heard it scratch the barn boards it was coming closer and i scrambled to my feet a sharp pain shot through my side some part of me moved too slow as its claws raked my shirt and cut into skin i tasted metal on my tongue and felt a freeze of terror so deep my chest tightened

i ran stumbling blind through the barn slipping in the wet floor and banging into barrels at last i saw the door and lunged for it the creature’s breath hot on my heels its claws slash the air inches from my back i felt the air tear as it passed me and then i burst out into night air like surf crashing on rocks

outside i limped away clutching my side the woods seemed quieter than before the trees formed dark shapes overhead i didn’t look back i kept moving until the old mill faded behind me and i reached the cracked pavement of the road that led home the stars looked so distant and cold and the wind whispered through the leaves like a sigh

my neighbor found me collapsed on her doorstep she called an ambulance and held a blanket around me but my mind was far away i heard her voice asking questions but everything sounded muffled as if i was underwater i could feel the blood seeping through my shirt and the pain in my side each breath a burning reminder of what had happened

at the hospital they cleaned the wound and wrapped it in bandages they said it was a deep gash probably caused by metal or glass i nodded but no one could explain the cuts the pattern was wrong jagged like claws not shards the doctor frowned but recorded it as an animal attack or a fall

i wanted to tell someone about what i saw but the words stuck in my throat no one would believe me how could i explain crawling on all fours a grin made of teeth and blood and eyes that glowed in darkness i left the hospital before sunrise and returned to my empty apartment where every corner seemed to hide a shadow

sleep did not come easy i lay awake listening for any sound nails scratching walls breathing just beyond the door sometimes i thought i heard a whisper telling me to come back to the dark where it waited but i told myself it was the wind or my mind playing tricks i stared at the ceiling until the first light of day crept in

the next morning i went to report what happened at the barn the police officer listened politely and took notes but when i finished he looked at me like i had lost my mind there were no footprints no drag marks no signs of a struggle just the barn door slightly ajar and scraps of burlap caught on a broken hinge

they dusted for prints and sent blood samples to the lab the results came back negative for any known animal or human dna it was declared a mystery and closed i walked away with a police report that said no evidence to support my story but i knew what i saw and felt because i still carry the scars on my side

i moved apartments and changed my routine but the memory follows me like a shadow even in crowded places i feel eyes on me and hear distant scratching at night sometimes when i close my eyes i see that grin and hear the ragged breath coming closer and i know it never left the barn it waits there in darkness hungrily waiting to find me again and finish what it started
