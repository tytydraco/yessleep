My wife, Emily, had severe bleeding after the delivery of our first baby. And she was dead for three minutes. I thank my lucky stars that the doctors could revive her. They had to put four pints of blood in her.

She was in a coma for two weeks. Her body was healing itself said the doctors. I can still feel the fear I felt, not knowing if I was going to lose the love of my life. Having a newborn child along with this, wore me down so much that I wished we never had our daughter.

Emily woke up on the 16th day. I cried like a baby then and within a month, we were back home. Life was good for a while. I had my wife and our little bundle of a miracle whom we named Lilly.

The changes began slowly. It was her eyes that I noticed first. Emily had such warm brown eyes that could put hot chocolate to shame. She had really expressive eyes, that were always full of joy. But one day, it was as if her eyes lost all emotions.

I was entering the kitchen to make some formula to feed the baby when I noticed Em staring at me or more like through me. Her eyes were empty. I asked if she was ok to which she said she was more than ok. I suspected maybe she had post partum depression because truth be told, the delivery was more than traumatic. I decided to observe her closer.

Then I noticed the staring. She'd be rocking our babygirl in the nursery one moment and then staring off into the distance the next. It would've been somewhat normal if it wasn't for the twitching. Her head would often twitch to the sides as if hearing something or someone.

It was one of these twitching episodes that had me believe it wasn't my wife anymore. 

I had a get together with my colleagues one night, after which I returned home around 1am. I was trying to be extra silent so as not to wake Lilly and Em.

I noticed that the light was on in the nursery. Maybe a late night feeding, I thought. 

The door to the nursery was slightly ajar and I peeked in to get a glimpse. What I saw shook me to my core.

Em was standing at the head end of the crib. Her face was, how should I say it, glitching? It was like another person was trapped in her body and was trying to get out and that face, it was not human.

I could feel my heart beating in my ears. I couldn't breathe. I slowly inched back but then I remembered about Lilly. That thing was with my baby. I pushed open the door, ready to what? hit my wife? I honestly didn't know what to do. That thing turned towards me and we locked eyes.

The next day I woke up on my bed in the same clothes. Emily wasn't in the room. I couldn't remember what happened last night. 

My baby. I had to get to my baby. I rushed out of the bedroom into the nursery. Lilly wasn't there. No, this couldn't be happening. 

Then I heard the giggles coming from downstairs. I flew down the stairs. Emily was in the kitchen bouncing Lilly in her arms.

"You were so drunk last night that you crashed out as soon as you got in', she says laughing.

 She looked normal, no glitching face, no empty eyes. She looked like my Emily. She felt like my Em.

The days passed and Emily was back to normal. Maybe the fear and stress had gotten into me. Maybe I imagined all this. A psychotic break I guess. 

All was well in our life.

Then came our anniversary. Lilly was to stay with my parents for the day. Em cooked my favourite dinner, dressed in a red halter dress that had me more than a little excited. Things got heated and we made love that night. It was the first time we were intimate after her delivery.

I woke up alone. The water was running in the bathroom. I slowly got up from the bed with the decision to surprise Em with a massage in the bath. She might have been sore from yesterday.

I inched open the door and what I saw had my heart beating hundreds a minute. 

Emily was standing in front of the mirror in the bathroom, rubbing her belly. Her very pregnant belly. The face in the mirror didn't belong to my Em, it was something else, something evil.

I closed the door quietly, got dressed as fast as I could and was out the house in minutes. It was like I was on autopilot. 

What the hell was that? What am I supposed to do now? Call an exorcist? But what about the thing in her belly?

Right now, I'm parked in front of my parents house writing this post. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't lose my Em, not again. So please, any advice you have will be greatly appreciated.
