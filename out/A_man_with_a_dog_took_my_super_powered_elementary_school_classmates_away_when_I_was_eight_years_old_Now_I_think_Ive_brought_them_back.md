I think we have all had the thought, or even tried to jump out of our window and pretended to be Peter Pan.

Most kids end up in the emergency room, because they are in fact not like the boy who never grew up—no matter how many times they watched the movie. 

I was one of these kids, unfortunately. 

But can you blame me? If you never fantasized about flying to Neverland and living forever fighting pirates as a little kid, you lacked an imagination. I didn’t jump out of my window, but I did try to do the famous Peter Pan swoop out of the tree in our yard, which of course landed me in a room of white with a broken arm and my mother screaming in my face. 

When Harry Sutton, the kid on my street, announced to the group of us at his eight birthday he was going to dive out of his bedroom window, the majority of us were excited to see him attempt it. Even me, who already had first-hand experience on how bad of an idea it was. I knew he had been steaming with jealousy that I had ended up with a cast on my arm and smothered in attention from classmates. I figured he was going to pull this stunt sooner or later. Harry was constantly trying to be better than everyone else. 

Still though, we were eight years old and filled with birthday cake and chocolate frosting. The adults were all inside talking about how amazingly talented Harry was, because he was one of the smartest in our class—led of course by his mother who would not stop talking about how her son was already being recommended to Ivy league colleges. 

Harry Sutton wasn’t that smart. But every parent wanted to believe their kid was special and one of a kind. It turned out, Harry did have something special about him. However, it was nothing to do with math. I remember standing with all the other kids staring up at Harry’s bedroom window, where he was perched, with his arms flung out. My mouth was full of cake and I was joining in the chant among the other kids urging him to jump.

“Jump!”

Harry Sutton was one of those kids who never refused a dare.

He ate worms and dirt, jumped into the deepest part of our town lake and even farted on the school’s intercom.

So, the idea of him doing something insane like pretending to be Peter Pan, had turned all of us into an excited mass of yelling and screaming, some of us laughing and giggling, while others, the weird ones, loudly described his untimely demise. Isadora Cassidy held up her soda can, waving it in the air. She jumped up and down, giggling, spinning around in the red dress she had made sure to tell all of us about all day. It was a nice dress, but she was acting like a princes, doing manic spins and twirls.

“Harry, you’re a chicken!”

My neighbor was coming close to stumbling into the Sutton’s pool, and I was quick to shove her forwards before she was inhaling pool-water.  “Jump, jump, jump!” 

Joining in with Isadora and the others, I forgot about the unimaginable pain I had felt when breaking my arm, suddenly thrilled with the thought of Harry getting his very own broken arm like me. He deserved it, after all. Harry was stupid enough to risk dying to one-up my attempt to be Peter Pen, so yes, I would definitely enjoy him taking a trip to the emergency room on his birthday. “Jump!”

Raising my voice over everyone else’s, I urged a grinning Harry to take the dive. But to my annoyance, he stumbled back, the confident smile on his face morphing into fright. He was looking down at all of us, and the drop, as well as the concrete patio and glistening pool water below him—and I think at that moment, Harry Sutton realized he had made a huge mistake. 

“Maybe you should get down?” Roman Faircliffe downed his own cup of soda, shouting up at Harry. 

I guessed Roman had taken one look at the concrete patio and imagined Harry’s head cracking like an egg on impact.  In response, of course, the birthday boy shook his head and scowled. Instead of giving up, he stepped closer to the edge, and one girl screamed. Being kids, I don’t think common sense existed among us. 

The filter which told you to “stop” wasn’t quite formed yet. Because, when we all started to call him a baby and a chicken, Harry Sutton actually defied all our  expectations.

And jumped.

At least… I think he jumped. I definitely saw his primed toes leave the plastic of his windowpane, and his fingers which had been grasping onto the window for dear life, thrusting forwards to propel him into the air. 

I don’t think any of us were expecting him to actually dive into the air like that. We might have been yelling and calling him a chicken, but we didn’t actually want him to do it. In fact, we had already been excitedly talking about what nicknames we could call him when we went back to school. Initially, I was sure I had seen him dive out of his window, and had covered my eyes, slimy chocolate cake creeping up my throat at the thought of the boy hitting the ground with a sickening smack. Harry was definitely going to be a pancake. I seized up, my body stiffening. Maybe he was going to die.

I had half a mind to run back inside and tell all of the parents--- and I had been stumbling back with heavy breaths, already sure all of the other kids were staring at his body on the ground. 

They were screaming, after all. 

But after a moment, I realized they weren’t screaming in terror. Instead, they were laughing and whooping, shouting the boy’s name in amazement. Curious, I peeled my clammy hands from my eyes, my gaze flicking to the ground in front of us. No Harry. 

At the corner of my eye, Isadora Cassidy was screaming—and I mean SCREAMING. Her eyes were wide with almost feral delight, a grin splitting her mouth apart. The crowd of kids followed her, all of them in some kind of frenzied trance, chanting Harry’s name. Before I looked up. I expected the boy to be still standing on the windowpane, after somehow defying the laws of physics and teasing us before diving back inside his window. But… no. 

Something clawed its way up my throat. 

But this time it wasn’t undigested cake. 

A cry erupted from my throat, a yell I wasn’t in control. Harry Sutton hadn’t plunged onto the ground with a splat. No. Because he never left the air, his body floating above us, suspended in mid-air like a real superhero. It took me a disorienting moment to notice Harry himself was screaming, in both terror and glee. I didn’t blame him. The kid had actually achieved every other kid’s dream. Being Peter Pan. But I wasn’t sure he was looking for Neverland. Part of me expected him to do just that, to swoop into the air just like the animated character. But no. 

His body was twisting and contorting, his arms flapping like a bird as if he struggled to stabilise himself. There were no strings. It wasn’t a trick of the eye, or a show I had been oblivious of.

Harry was flying. Just like Peter Pan. From the look on his face, wide, cartoon-like eyes and a wild grin, the boy had no idea what he was doing or how he was doing it. The rest of the party was as you would expect when the birthday boy was kind of… stuck in the air. Harry’s mom fainted, while the rest of the parents sort of stood there in disbelief. After being stuck in the air, struggling and trying to control himself, Harry did manage to touch down onto the ground, and stumbled straight into his horrified father’s arms.

Initially, my town had no idea what to think. Parents thought was some kind of miracle kid, while church-goers were either convinced he was a gift from God, or the physical embodiment of hell itself. Like in all small towns, the latter became a rumour which couldn’t be stopped. 

Two days after the boy had somehow flew in front of a group of parents and kids at his eighth birthday, strangers were already stalking him on his way from school. 

Harry lived opposite me, so I would wake up every morning to people from the church holding up huge wooden signs and demanding they take Harry to “purify” him. 

When the adults were all arguing, with Harry’s parents being verbally and physically attacked. 

Harry came over, eager to hide in my bedroom.

Mom was sceptical at first, because in her eyes it was technically kidnapping, but Harry was terrified. He thought he was going to die, and to my surprise, wrapped his arms around my mom, and begged her to protect him.

She did. 

Mom made sure to make him feel as welcome as possible, and his gift was kept from conversation. When I tried to ask him if was planning on becoming Superman when he grew up, mom gave me The LookTM. Harry’s mother came to collect him, her eyes haunted. She no longer looked at him like she was her talented little boy. Instead, her eyes were cold.

When the boy reached for her hand, Mrs Sutton acted like he had the plague, instead gently ushering him from our kitchen.

I didn’t expect to see Harry again. 

In my head, he had been sent to a school for gifted children.

But when I walked into class the next day, Harry was sitting at his seat like usual. He was jittery, his knees bouncing under his desk, though seemed mostlyokay. There was a group of kids crowded around him, and the boy was clearly overwhelmed. 

This time he wasn’t enjoying the attention. 

Harry explained the whole thing had been a one-time thing, and he was okay after multiple visits to the doctor, as well as a baptism at the church. From the look on his face, I knew he didn’t have a choice whether he was baptised or not. Still though, Harry seemed his chipper self when he talked more, explaining that he was expected to talk at the carnival about his “trick” and how it had absolutely nothing to do with any odd gifts—and it was just that, a “trick”. Harry Sutton was lying about it being a one-time-thing. 

Because he had been hovering in front of my window two nights before, the two of us seeing how long he could float for. He managed twenty minutes before my mom quite literally dragged him back inside. It looked like his parents had strictly told him that it couldn’t happen again. Harry seemed happy with that.

I took my usual seat. Class started out as normal as it had ever been. Though I did notice our teacher, Mrs Jackson, casting looks towards Harry. The boy had always been a star student, and she often enjoyed including him in class discussion. 

This time, though, when he raised his hand to answer questions she was throwing at the class, the teacher completely ignored him—and even gone as far as moving away from him, making it very obvious she didn’t want to be near the kid in the politest way possible. 

Harry seemed angry at first. Upset. He gritted his teeth all the way through reading time which was usually his time to shine, since he was several reading stages above all of us. Instead, Mrs Jackson picked out Roman Fairview to read a passage from a book I knew he couldn’t understand or read. Neither could I. 

The cover was very grown up, and when I peeked inside, every single word was gibberish to me. Usually, Harry would be able to breeze through the first few pages to bring us all into the story. But now that it was Roman, the kid who only spoke to announce he had accidentally stuck a needle through his finger, I was expecting chaos. 

I was right. Roman wasn’t great at reading big words, and when he attempted the tongue-twister which was the opening paragraph, kids were already giggling and whispering to each other. I don’t think he meant to say “poop” instead of “coop” when reading about chickens, but it definitely sounded like “poop”. Which sent the class into fits of laughter, with Harry, happy all the attention was off of him, twisting around in his chair and calling the boy stupid directly to his face.

“I’m not stupid.” Roman’s face was glowing red, which was making everyone laugh more.

I could see the book’s pages in his hands crinkling under his clenching fingers.

Harry threw a pen at him, and the breath caught in my throat when it bounced off the wood of his desk. “Yes you are.” The boy’s grin was wide. “It’s not hard.”

“But I can’t…” Roman squinted, glaring at the book. He lifted his head with helpless eyes. “Mrs Jackson, all the words are squiggly.”

I think Mrs Jackson was having a bad day 

"Read it, please.” She said stiffly. “Start from the beginning, Roman.”

The boy started to read again, but he kept stumbling over his words. This time, to my confusion, the teacher actually laughed. 

Mrs Jackson had never laughed at us. Ever. In fact, I always saw her as one of the nicer teachers. I remembered falling over at recess, and she took her time to sit with me and talk calmly while the school nurse was picking gravel from the ugly cut in my knee. Now, she was actively smirking at Roman, who had gone tomato red. “I can’t read it.” He whispered, his hands going to claw at his hair. I noticed my textbook slide off of my desk. 

But I hadn’t touched it. Then, across the room, Lissa Jason’s pen flew out of her hands and hit the wall. “I can’t read it!” Roman shrieked, before jumping to his feet and shoving his desk over.

But his desk wasn’t the only one which moved. I thought it was an earthquake at first. Though it wasn’t the ground which was shaking, it was every object in the classroom, shaking, quivering, before dropping onto the ground. The first wave was relatively normal. Some kids screamed in fright, and the teacher dropped to her knees to cover her own head, while yelling at us to get under our desks. Before Roman dropped to his knees, sobbing and pulling out chunks of his hair. When he pounded the floor with his fists, everything seemed to go in slow motion in front of me. My desk flew up, up, up into the air and crashed into the ceiling with every other—hovering for maybe half a second, before crashing back onto the ground.

I wasn’t aware that I had been crushed by one, and with foggy thoughts bleeding through me, I could only lay on my back and stare at Ben Tanner who sat in front of me. His body was still in the air, but it was contorted and wrong, twisted, like his bones had been ripped from him. There were three others like Ben, hanging suspended in mid-air. Dead. They were dead. Lucy, Jane, and Ryan. 

I could see their blood hanging with them, pooling in thick beads around head wounds I knew wouldn’t get better. 

Mrs Jackson, who at first had been transfixed by the bodies hanging in the air, had crawled over to Roman, who was still sobbing into his knees, and grasped onto his shoulders, whispering for him to calm down, and that it was going to be okay. 

When the boy collapsed into her chest, sobbing into her shoulders, our dead classmates rained down from the sky—like angels. I lay on my back for a long time with an aching arm and a scary cut on my leg, surrounded by the skeletons of desks and textbooks littering the floor, frowning at one singular pen still hovering in the air, I started to wonder if I was going to die. 

If one of my classmates was going to kill me. 

Mom came to collect me, not saying a word in the car. Instead of talking to me about my three dead classmates, and Roman Fairview, she took me to Target to distract me. She bought me a new coat, some dry shampoo, and a comic book. 

When she was loading groceries into the car, I glimpsed a kid standing on the other side of the road. Mimi Wainwright. She had been sick on the day of Roman’s breakdown. I don’t think her mom had told her, because when she saw me, she waved. “Cole!” Mimi bounced up and down with a wide smile. “Hi! Did you watch the new episode of SpongeBob?!” 

Mimi Wainwright was known for being a big baby in our class. She cried at almost everything, but I really liked her. She was originally from Australia, which meant she had a crazy accent which I loved to make fun of. Mimi talked weird, but when I teased her, she just giggled and purposely over exaggerated her accent. I could share my SpongeBob theories with her during recess, and she ate each one up with the kind of excitement and positivity which made her look like she was glowing.

As usual, Mimi’s hair was in pigtails she kept tugging at. Before I could reply, Mimi’s mother, who clearly knew about the Roman incident from the look on her face, ushered her daughter away, the two of them walking hand-in-hand. Mimi, none the wiser, skipped and jumped across cracks in the sidewalk, laughing when she stumbled over. “Can we go to the park?”

“No, Mimi.”

I could just about hear their conversation, as I moved down the sidewalk, eager to know if Mimi knew about Roman.

“But I want to go to the park! Can we go for five minutes?! Mimi hopped forwards, almost falling over. “Please, mum!”

“No.”

“But—”

“Miriam, we are going home.”

“No.”

Mimi came to an abrupt stop. “No. I want to go to the park.”

When her mother grabbed her gently, Mimi screamed. I was used to her screaming when she didn’t get her way. But this was a different type of scream which carried in the air, more of a wail, one which sent me to my knees, my hands slamming over my ears and a shockwave rattling the world around me. I saw the first collision, a truck slamming into the back of a school bus. That was enough to send my thoughts spiralling into a frenzy. All I could see was Mimi. Mimi's eyes were closed, her hands over her ears, mouth open—wailing. 

And her scream was turning my brain into soup, sending waves of agony crashing into my skull.

When something wet and warm dripped down my neck, I stopped thinking. I just remembered Mimi’s blonde curls caught in a whirlwind, and her mother, who wasn’t moving, lying in a seeping scarlet which seemed to move in its own way, like it was sentient. Mimi’s scream was like a monster breaking into my skull and leeching to my brain. And I couldn’t get it out.

Once it was in there, once her cry had threaded its way into me, it wouldn’t leave. I remember feeling lightheaded and strange, like I was flying. Other people around me were dropping onto the ground. I was staring at a woman with a stroller, who had abandoned her baby, rolling around and screeching into the concrete.  

There was another loud crash, and I was violently thrown onto my back, staring at the glow of the sun—and my mother’s frightened face. She was pulling me to my feet, and across the road, where the road had been mostly empty, was a pileup of cars which had crashed into each other like in the movies. “Miriam!” 

Mimi’s father was trying to calm the girl down, and I really thought he was going to succeed. I could see him through flickering eyes. The man took slow steps towards his daughter with his arms out, ready to pull  the hysterical girl into a hug. Before…

I blinked rapidly.

Before… red.

There was an explosion of red where Mimi’s father was supposed to be, before his headless body slammed into the ground with a meaty smack. And that was the first time I realized that it wasn’t just Harry Sutton and Roman Fairview who could do scary things. Our whole town was cursed with kids who could suddenly hurt people without wanting to, or even realizing.

They were murderers without motive. Or the motive was as pathetic as not being able to go to the park or being unable to read a book properly. Problems which usually plagued us which would cause us to cry or get angry, were suddenly being solved by exploding heads or sending inanimate objects flying into the air. I cried to get my own way or went to my bedroom to make some kind of point. My classmates, however, were barbecuing their teachers. I wasn’t in class when it happened, but enough kids who weren’t traumatised were already talking about it. Sam Sutcliffe, after being told he wouldn’t be making the junior soccer team, had set the coach on fire during an argument. 

One of the kids who had been there had described it as Sam snapping his fingers with a smirk, but from the expression on Sam’s face I’d caught while his mother dragged him to the car after being suspended, I knew he too didn’t mean it. 

Roman didn’t mean to kill three classmates, and Mimi didn’t want to kill her mother, and explode her father’s head. But they couldn’t control it. Whatever “it” was, controlled them.

Before I knew it, the strange affliction was spreading like a sickness.

Isadora, my neighbor, could suddenly set fire to things too.

Sounds cool on paper, right?

Not when you’re eight years old and have no control over it. Just like Sam Sutcliffe.

She didn’t come to school for a week and I thought she had the flu, before mom came to my room and told me calmly that Isadora was sick like the other kids. I didn’t understand what she meant until I woke to the stink of smoke choking the back of my nose and throat, and a fiery orange glow through the window we usually talked through. Our windows had always faced each other since we were kids, so the two of us had grown up talking to each other. 

Isadora’s bright pink curtains had been set alight, consumed in brilliant, beautiful and yet terrifying orange. Mom dragged me outside where we watched Isadora’s house explode, with Isadora and her mother standing outside, watching their house crumble. Isadora seemed remarkably calm, her eyes lit up in the glow of the dancing flame in front of her. 

When I tried to talk to the girl, my mom pulled me away and strictly told me I was to not speak to any of the infected kids. It became almost the norm to see a tree set on alight on the way home in the car, or a dead body in the road. Where there was a corpse, a kid from my school was always nearby, and 9 times out ten, they were in hysterics. Some kids had found a way to use their abilities for their own personal benefit. Though it’s not like they were hurting anyone. A girl who could turn invisible was caught stealing candy from the store and was treated like a criminal. The mayor declared a curfew, and announced a crisis meeting which would be held at the town hall, which all parents had to attend. The infected kids, which the majority of the elementary school, were locked up in the sheriff’s office.

After multiple visits to the town doctor, and an MRI scan, mom told me I seemed to be okay—but I had to be kept under constant observation. So, that meant going along with her to the town meeting. When we walked in, however, I was stared at like I was a feral beast, and my mother was told to escort her “monstrous” child out of the premises. That’s how I ended up sitting on the concrete steps leading into the town hall, the sun baking through my shirt, a sickly feeling in my gut which wouldn’t go away, and Pokémon Sun on my 3DS. 

I knew about the whole craze with Pokémon go. Teenagers across town were obsessed with it. While elementary school children were developing abilities nobody could understand, the seniors in high school were freaking out every time they found a rare Pokémon. Part of me could understand. I think the teens wanted a distraction from their freakish siblings. 

I did ask mom for a phone, but apparently I was too young for one. So, it was just my 3DS and me. I was gritting my teeth through a tough match, when a shadow loomed over me, accompanied with a sudden wave of nausea. When I lifted my head, I found myself staring at one of the most beautiful grown up’s I had ever seen. 

Though I wasn’t sure if he even was a grown up. His face looked… strange. It’s like I was staring at a being pretending to be human.

The man wore a white lab-coat and jeans, though when my eyes travelled up to his face, his ears were oddly pointy, and his skin was far too white, a sheen to it. The man’s eyes though, were… hypnotising; a shade of green I had never seen before. I found myself lost in his eyes, in his wide grin, before I managed to tear my gaze from his face, and drink in the rest of him.

His body was oddly shaped, like a shadow which had come to life. With him, to my surprise, was a dog, a golden Labrador attached to a leash. “Hello.” The man’s smile wasn’t friendly. When he spoke, his tongue was far too long and slimy, flicking out of his mouth like a lizard. His accent was strange. Like Mimi’s, but a little different. I had heard it on the TV, and mom often pointed out people with the accent. “Can you point me in the way of the mayor’s office, please? I have heard whispers of some frightening children causing problems. I spoke to your mayor, and…” The man trailed off, chuckling. 

“Dear lord, why am I talking to a child?” He seemed to chastise himself, or maybe he was talking to the dog. “Where is the mayor’s office?”

I patted the dog with a smile. “In there.” I pointed inside. “I’m not allowed in.”

The man’s lips curved. “Oh.” He inclined his head. “Are you one those…” He drifted off, his tongue coming out in another slithery flick. Like a snake. “Are you one of the inflicted?”

“No.”

He frowned. “Oh, that makes sense,” he hummed. “I don’t believe I remember your face from the field trip last year.” His lips split into a grin. “Kid, you missed out on quite the opportunity! What child doesn’t want to see the wonders of nuclear power?”

I frowned at him. “You’re weird.”

He looked taken aback for a moment before side-stepping past me and pushing through the doors.

“Who was that?”

When I twisted around, Tommy, one of my friends, was in front of me. Tommy had voices in his head. He told me they sounded like roaring waves, a string of unintelligible words constantly inside his head. At first, it had driven him crazy. 

He had to be carried out of class, screaming about his brain being taken over by aliens. After a while though, he seemed to have at least gotten used to it. Tommy knew exactly what I was thinking or going to think. He could also make people do things if he grabbed their hands. Luckily, he only used that ability to stay up late or get extra pudding. To combat the voices, Tommy wore headphones. Tommy’s smile was wide, but I knew he was faking it. Being locked in the sheriff’s office with half of the town’s kids couldn’t have been fun. I jumped to my feet, shoving my DS in my pocket. “Nobody,” I said, “How did you get out?”

Tommy folded his arms. “Harry can fly, remember?”

“So, he brought you? Like a bird?” I couldn’t resist a laugh, and the sickly feeling coiling in my gut faded a little.

He shoved me with a laugh. “No! I mean… he used his… uh.. his thing… to help a bunch of us escape. And here I am!”

I frowned. “Why?”

Tommy’s eyes darkened. He stepped closer to me, his breath in my face. “Because they’re going to send us away,” he said softly. “I heard it.”

“Aren’t you scared?” I asked. “Of the voices?”

He shrugged. “I was at first. But now I can kind of work it, it’s kind of fun.”

“Can you hear me?”

Tommy nodded.

“What am I thinking?”

He didn't look at me, folding his arms across his chest. “You’re scared of me, stupid head."

“No. No, that’s—-“

“It’s okay.” Tommy smiled. “I know that you think Mimi is pretty.”

“I do not!”

Our laughter was cut short by the doors flying open, our mayor appearing, followed by a mass of parents yelling and crying, clutching their kids for dear life. The kids were strangely quiet. And when I followed their gazes, they were staring at the strange man in the lab-coat.

“The decision has been made!” The mayor shouted over them. “Doctor Markham will take the inflicted children—and in exchange for curing them or their sickness, they will reside with him at the facility he works at. No! I am not making any exceptions!”

Tommy stumbled back, his eyes wide. “What’s happening?”

I grasped for his hand, but mom was pulling me away. “Come on, baby.”

“Where are we going? What about Tommy?"

“Cole, I said we’re going home.”

Parents were right to hold their children back and attempt to drag them away. But the strange man was quick to stop them. He pulled out a violin, to my confusion, and began to play.

Mom’s hands were suddenly over my ears, and she was whispering that this “enchantment” wasn’t for me. The Pied Piper, she called the man. Though I was sure The Pied Piper didn’t wear jeans and a lab-coat. I couldn’t hear the violin, but I was sure it wasn’t the cause of the kids suddenly coming to an abrupt halt, and following the man as he strolled down the road—whatever melody he was playing somehow bringing the parents to an unsettling calm. They stopped crying, and simply dropped to their knees, their expressions going blank. 

The kids didn’t just seem hypnotised by the man. They followed him, dancing, and twirling, grasping onto each other and laughing, wide smiles on their faces. When Tommy let go of my hand and joined the end of the line, I could only watch him disappear with the line of kids. I followed them despite my mother’s protests. I knew the instrument the man was playing was not responsible for playing with their minds. Instead, it was a device poking from his pocket. I tried to snap Tommy out of it. Keeping low, following their march through town as onlookers stared in bewilderment, I threw pebbles at Tommy’s back to try and get him to look at me. 

Tommy was gone. He might have still been there physically, but my friend joined the others, trapped in endless happiness with the other kids, as the man with the violin led them into the forest where they completely disappeared from view. I was told the man would only take them for a few days, cure their sickness, and then give them back as good as new.

However, days passed.

Then weeks.

A whole month.

“When is Tommy coming home?” I asked over breakfast one day. I couldn’t even eat my cereal, I felt sick to my stomach.

Mom was frowning at her phone, scrolling through vacation pictures. “What was that, sweetie?”

“Tommy.” I dropped my spoon in my cereal. “And Isadora. When are they coming home?”

Mom looked up from her phone, her eyebrows pinched together. “Who are you talking about, honey?”

Her words sent something cold squirming down my spine. I dived upstairs to the bathroom and managed to choke up my breakfast, but the feeling wouldn’t go away. When I asked Harry’s parents where he was, his mother just laughed and told me she did not have any kids. I tried other parents, and went as far as screaming at them in the street—where were their kids? 

Why was I the only one who could remember them? 

Mom told me I had an overactive imagination, insisting that I had made them all up, especially when I told her that Harry could fly, and Mimi had a scream which could explode her dad’s head. 

The local doctor told me I was just an imaginative child.

And I really started to question myself. 

Had I really made them up? 

Isadora, who I had known since we were babies, was she really just a character in my head?

Harry. Who could fly, and Tommy who could read minds….

All of them sounded like my own personal characters in the comic book inside my mind.

That was until I found them.

I didn’t mean to find them. I’m going to describe it the best way I can. I woke up one morning with an empty feeling like something had been ripped from my gut.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t swallow, and when mom tried to snap me out of it, I just told her I needed to go somewhere. Mom was worried, so she rang the doctor. 

I snuck out under her nose and went exactly where the feeling told me. I went to the woods.

I wasn’t the first person to find them. I could tell by the growing crowd of people muttering to each other, that something had been found.

Inside a shallow ditch deep in our forest were exactly twenty bodies piled on top of each other. There was no blood or gore which would make my stomach turn, but it was just the sight of them dumped there which sent my thoughts spiralling. I thought I had imagined them. 

I thought I was crazy. But they were there. 

The town had forgotten its children, parents gathering who had no idea they were looking at their own cursed kids. They didn’t look like my classmates. They were… thin. Almost skeletal. Like they had been drained of their life.

There was nothing to assume foul play.

According to our mayor and the police, it looked like a group of kids had starved to death or been poisoned. There were two survivors. Charlotte Tate, who couldn’t die, and Roman Fairview, who she happened to be clinging onto. It didn’t take long for the town to be introduced to their abilities when Roman sent dust flying into the air when he was dragged from the hole, whimpering under his breath and shaking his head, his eyes blank and unseeing.  The two of them were mute, traumatised by whatever they had seen. 

While Roman acted like an animal, mumbling to himself, Charlotte calmly climbed out of the hole and brushed herself down. I was watching them be escorted away in a police car when mom finally found me, wrapping her arms around me. “They’re miracles.” She whispered into my ear. 

I told her they had been hurt by the bad man with the dog, and mom just rolled her eyes and patted me on the back. It was a poisoning, according to the report in the newspaper—and to my confusion, nobody was questioning who these kids were. Neither Charlotte nor Roman seemed to remember they even had parents, which worked in the mayor’s favor. As soon as he realized the two of them had abilities that were out of this world, he adopted two of them, renaming them. Charlotte and Roman West. 

I tried to talk to them numerous times, but it was impossible. Every time I tried to, I was dragged out by a guard or chastised by my pissed mother. “It’s none of your business.” I was told, after being threatened with a restraining order at the age of thirteen.

But I didn’t care.

I wanted answers.

I wanted to know why my best friend wasn’t just dead in a hole in the ground but forgotten by his parents—and the whole town.

I wanted to know why my classmate’s had developed these abilities in the first place.

Years passed, and every day I woke up and went straight to my window expecting Isadora’s smiling face.

Instead, I was greeted to the blackened skeleton of what had been her bedroom.

Isadora’s parents had moved away when I was twelve.

On my fifteenth birthday, I had that same sickly feeling twisting in my gut. When I opened the window that morning, a sour stink tickled the back of my nose and throat, a thick greenish mist hanging in the air. It didn’t last, thankfully. By the time I had biked my way to ‘school’ which was just a classroom in the town hall due to there barely being any fifteen year olds in town, the stink had mostly cleared. 

School consisted of three students, a stuffy room and a laptop. 

The students were the  mayor’s adopted children, Roman and Lottie, and me. Being in a room with two super powered teenagers for six hours was as fun as you can imagine. 

Lottie blasted her Spotify playlist, her head of dark curls nestled in her arms, and Roman watched YouTube videos on his phone. 

I wasn’t sure if the two remembered what had happened to them, so maybe I could call it trauma. But they were assholes. Charlotte spent most of her nights at the hospital healing people, after the town discovered her gift could be contagious. 

I used to be Roman’s friend as a kid. The two of us and Harry were like the three musketeers, along with Tommy and Isadora. Now, it was like he couldn’t recognise me. All I was to him was a plain kid lacking superpowers. Which apparently was his only personality trait. Roman liked his powers and used them to get what he wanted. Being the mayor’s adopted son was also a plus, I guess.

Lottie made sure to sit as far away from me as possible, while Roman used a pen and paper, which was his way of communicating due to him being mute, to drive me nuts. That day it was no different. 

Five minutes into a math class which was just a YouTube tutorial playing on a large screen, Roman tapped me on the shoulder, before sliding over a piece of paper with a crude looking drawing on it. 

Roman wasn’t the best artist, though his skills were good enough for me to understand what he had drawn. It was a badly drawn sketch of the man with the dog who had taken them away at the age of eight years old. The man I thought I fucking imagined, and yet somehow the mute idiot with an anger problem remembered his kidnapper. I couldn’t believe it. For a moment, I thought I was seeing things, before Roman prodded the drawing with a grin.

Written underneath a stick person which I guessed was me, which was being sawn in half by a giant sword, were the words:

“YOU’RE NEXT LOL.”

“Wait.” I jumped up, my fingers curling around the drawing. “Can you… remember what happened?”

When Roman rolled his eyes, I couldn’t stop myself. “The man who took you,” I hissed out. “You remember him, right?”

“Cole.”

The guard standing outside the door cleared his throat. “What did I tell you about speaking during class?”

I didn’t reply, screwing up the drawing and throwing it at a smiling Roman’s face.

“Talk.” I spat. “I know you can, asshole. You’re not fooling me.”

I turned to Charlotte.

“Lottie?” I swallowed. “You were both there! You… you survived, and they didn’t!” I couldn’t stop my voice from choking up. “How is that fair? Why did he leave you behind, but not them?”

Roman grabbed his notepad, scribbled something down and held it up.

“Shut the fuck up.” The note said.

He wrote something else, and I noticed his hand trembling around the pen.

“Drop it.”

I couldn’t resist a choked laugh. “Drop what?” I yelled. “Why don’t you talk to me, huh? I know you can.”

Roman's eyes darkened, his lips curling into a scowl. Before I could attempt to get away from him, the air was suddenly moving in front of me, blurring into one confusing mass, and my legs were slowly lifting from the ground. Over the years, Roman had managed to come into his ability. Instead of throwing a tantrum at eight years old, sending desks and students flying into the air, the boy was pinning me to the ceiling with a simple stare. He let me go, eventually, after I was forced to apologise. 

I wasn’t sure if Roman knew what “letting go” meant, though. Because sending me plummeting to the ground head-first was worse than being trapped under his control. 

I thought about telling mom about what was technically bullying, but since it was the mayor’s son, I had no chance of even getting an intervention. It was dark when I got home. The three of us had to stay until all of our work was finished, and that dragged on to almost 8PM. Roman’s drawing played on my mind all day. 

I didn’t understand what he’d meant until Isadora’s dog greeted me when I was dragging myself up our driveway. At first, I was happy to see her, but my mind was filled with questions from Roman’s drawing—my body aching from the awkward way I’d hit the ground after being released from Roman’s psycho power. 

I reached out to stroke the dog, dragging my fingers through her fur, before I caught my fingers which were covered in soot and dried blood. I lurched back with a hiss. Betsy died during the explosion. I remembered Isadora hyperventilating when they found the dog’s remains among the wreckage of her house.

So, how…

“Hey!”

Lifting my head, I found myself staring at a ghost.

No, not a ghost.

Tommy.

His rotting body, which was somehow mending itself right in front of me and was growing up right in front of my eyes. 

His sunken eyes were growing, bulging from his skull, thick dark hair sprouting from his head.

He was coming back to life, the closer he was to me. The boy was dragging himself down our lawn with one leg, while his arms stayed limp at his side. He looked like a zombie, and yet it was still Tommy. It was still the kid I thought was dead; the boy I had been forced to forget.

There wasn’t much of his face left, most of it had been eaten away by the earth after being buried for eight years. And somehow my super powered friend was standing right in front of me. Tommy, with the body of an eight year old, and the mind of a teenager, spat in my face, a mouthful of bloody dribble.

I stumbled back, swiping at my mouth.

Well, I wasn’t expecting that.

“Why the fuck,” he said, “Did you bring us back?”
