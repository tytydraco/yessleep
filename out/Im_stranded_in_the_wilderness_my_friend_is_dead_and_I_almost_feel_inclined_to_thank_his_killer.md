It is what it sounds like, I watched my old friend get shot in front of me and the person who did it just locked me in a room, yet part of me still wants to thank them. I'm honestly not sure how good of an idea it is to be writing this right now, the person that locked me in here is still around, I've heard them walk by a few times, and though it's been hours it doesn't look like they plan on sleeping anytime soon.

At the very least they aren't hanging around listening for me, and I suppose if they were going to hurt me they would have done it already. I’m too on edge to sleep, and sitting here with my thoughts isn't helping. All I can really think to do is write them down, the service out here is as spotty as ever, and with my phone smashed to bits I doubt I’ll be able to call for help. I'm just lucky I found this laptop, they didn't check the room much when they threw me in here. No windows and a locking door was enough, I guess.

I’ll try to get my thoughts in order here. How “ordered” I’ll end up making them? I'm not sure, but some messed up things have happened, and I feel like I'm losing my mind just stewing over them. I'll start from the beginning. I work at a remote summer camp on a lake in Ontario. It sits on a small island, way out in the wilderness just north of the Canadian border. The whole place is abandoned during the winter, but a few times every season we send someone up to check in on the place. This year, I was chosen.

The drive up was quiet, with each passing hour I saw fewer and fewer cars until I reached the turnoff onto the long road to camp. On that road I saw no one, and hours later I came down into the snowy parking lot and pulled my car into a garage on shore. I set out on foot across the frozen lake, and upon shore I went to the electrical shed to turn on the island's generator, the only source of power due to the camp's remoteness.

The moment I left the little building after starting it, I was met by the sidelong stare of a deer, standing some five or so feet away on the trail ahead of me. It isn't uncommon to see wildlife out here, but they tend to be pretty shy around people. This deer on the other hand, stood just paces away, unmoving and looking right at me. 

The animal didn't seem well off. It looked mangy and malnourished. Its hide was taut against its bony frame, ribs and joints jutting out visibly. In places its fur was shed down to the bare skin, which was blotchy, and discolored. Its stare was glassy eyed, and it stood there with an awkward stance, as if struggling to hold itself upright as it peered over at me. After a mistaken breath through my nose I could tell something was seriously wrong with it.

I winced when I breathed in. A fetid, sickly sweet odor filled my nostrils and made me gag on my own spit. It smelled like it was dying, like it was one missed heartbeat away from dropping off the face of the earth, and the odor was bad enough to urge me to get away from the thing. I couldn't take it, the stench made my stomach twist and I locked up as fast as possible and set out for the camps lodge where I planned to stay. 

The encounter freaked me out. Of course I felt bad for it, its condition was saddening and it looked like it was in pain, but I couldn't deny that it unnerved me. Its eyes were glazed over, but at the same time they seemed to bore right into me.

If you’ve ever gotten that uncomfortable feeling of being watched, it felt just like that, except the animal doing the watching was standing right there in front of me. 

I know it was irrational, but after walking for a moment longer I couldn't bear the urge to check. A glance over my shoulder told me that it was still standing there, craning its neck at an odd angle to look right at me. I tried to assure myself that it was all in my head, but the feeling of its stare burrowing into me persisted as I walked up the path. Regardless, I was glad when the smell dissipated after getting farther away from it.

I tried to put my worries aside and think logically. Animals get sick, it's disheartening to see but it happens. I also had stuff to do, and I focused on the work that needed to get done. After getting inside the lodge I dropped off my bags, turned on the circuit breakers and heating in the basement, and went out into the cold once again to check the place out.

Things were normal around camp, the old buildings were as sturdy as ever and the few issues worth fixing wouldn't take long. Still, I felt uneasy. Even after a few rounds I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. Every slight sound spiked my heart rate, and while the deer seemed to have disappeared, or at the very least decided to stay out of sight, I caught traces of the rotting smell lingering in the air. Shivers crawled through me each time one crossed me, but no amount of nervous looking showed me their source.

Admittedly I was on edge, and resigned to the fact that I was freaking out over a mangy animal, I made my way back to my car on the mainland. I was lucky enough to be acquainted with one of the few sociable people nearby, an older man named Richard, who I met through my years working at the camp. He stayed in the area year round, and was one of the only people I talked to during my rare winter visits. 

I thought that catching up would help clear my head, and frankly I was still exhausted from the car ride up, not being in the mood to do any more work. I hadn't spoken to him since summer, and I wanted to talk about the happenings in the area. Especially the deer, it kept weighing on me, and I’d never seen anything like it before. Mange? Something else? It almost looked like chronic wasting disease, but I knew it was completely unheard of in the area. Regardless, if anyone around might have seen more signs of it, it would be him. 

After a short drive, I turned the corner into his lot, and my mood faltered a bit. His truck was sitting out in the open, coated in a layer of snow. It struck me as odd. I knew that he kept religiously good care of it, more so during the winter, but there it sat outside in the middle of the driveway, being unattended since at least the last snowfall.

Getting out of my car I approached the stout cabin. Fresh bootprints led up to the door, so it seemed he was inside, for whatever reason leaving his truck out in the snow. I knocked on the front door once, then again, and again until my hand started to hurt. Concern grew in me, I don't know what I was worried about exactly, but I felt pushed to check in on him. I tried the knob, not expecting it to give, but to my surprise the door swung open. The inside of the cabin was dark, and upon stepping in I felt the icy air stay unrelenting around me. If he was home, he was braving the freezing temperatures inside, making no effort to heat the house.

I heard the scuff of something move beside me in the darkened room. Before I could look, blunt, cold metal pressed onto my ear with enough force to jerk my head to the side. I froze up, I wasn't sure what it was, but I could make a good assumption. My words poured out before I could even think.

“Richard! Fucking christ, its Daniel! Daniel from the summer camp? You know me dont you? Look I don't want any trouble, just put it down and we can-”

The person beside me pulled back the hammer on what I could now be sure was a gun. They spoke in a cold, commanding tone, pressing the weapon harder into the side of my head. “Stop. Calm down and stay still, you follow my instructions and you won't get hurt, understand?”  It sounded like a woman's voice, and whoever it was, it certainly wasn't Richard. I gave a shaking nod.

“Good. You got an ID on you?” She said.

“I do, i can give you my wallet if you want, just, please, I don't want any trouble."

"Neither do I, give it to me and we'll see if you came looking for it."

"The fuck is that supposed to- nevermind, forget it. Here " I said, pulling it out of my back pocket and pointing my hand out behind me. The wallet left my hand, and a moment later the gun left my neck. I had the urge to bolt out the door, but almost on cue she said, "Try anything and I drop you. Sit tight for a second."

After a moment the barrel pressed against my neck again. "I'm gonna ask you a few questions. You answer them right and you go home, you don't, and you stay here… Figuratively speaking."

"Okay I- I think I understand what you're saying."

"Good. First, what is your full name, date of birth, and height?"

"Right, okay. My full name is Daniel Girard Mayfield, born October fourth 1994, and I'm, well shit I don't know, a hundred eighty centimeters? I mean it doesn't have to be exact right? You aren't going to shoot me if i'm off a few- please I really don't-"

"Okay, chill. Chill out and shut your mouth. You're fine, I don't expect you to have your exact height memorized. Next I want to know what you're doing out here. Both in general and why you're snooping around this house."

Lip quivering, I tried to answer. "Look, please I just work out here, I work at a summer camp, it's empty now but I'm here to check up on it, so here I am. And why Im here? I'm looking for my friend. He lives here, Richard Anderson, if you know him, or if you're his kid, or something. I haven't seen him in months and I'm worried."

She let out a long sigh, and the pressure against my neck dropped away before she spoke. "Look, I'm sorry, but I don't know your friend. I didn't talk to a Richard when I bought this place last month, never saw him before or after then. I wish I could help you but I can't, and regardless, you can't stick around for it if I could. You need to get in your car and go home."

"Woah, what? Look I just have to figure out what's going on, you said you bought the place? Can I at least turn and talk to you face to face-"

"No. What you have to do is leave, turn around and walk to your car. Dont turn my way when you do."

"Please, don't leave me in the dark here, he's old, and if you bought this house, well, I dont know but hes not the type to sell he has a choice, and-" still trying for answers, I was cut off again by the gun to my head.

"Turn around. Walk. I'm sorry, truly, but I cant help you. You need to leave now, I won't ask again."

Defeated, scared and at a loss for words, I relented. I turned and left. The moment I crossed onto the porch the door slammed shut behind me.

Halfway to my car I turned my head to look at the place, and was about to keep walking when something caught my eye. A dark shape lingered in the shadows between the garage and cabin, I squinted to make it out but it moved away and out of view before I could place it. An animal, maybe? A person? Just a trick of the light? I didn't care.

All I wanted was to get back, pack my things and go home. I didn't want to spend a minute that wasn't necessary being around. I figured I could ask around, figure things out elsewhere, all that mattered was getting home. Sadly, the forces of nature had other plans.

The temperature had been dropping since I first arrived, and after being above freezing the entire day before then, the roads were slick. On the way to camp I struggled to come to a stop even going ten under the limit, sliding out onto the road. With high winds now blowing down from the north, the sun setting fast, and temperatures still plummeting, I didn't feel safe driving home in the dark. All the fear of getting shot aside, dying of hypothermia in a ditch on the side of the road would be worse.

I couldnt get any service to check now, but earlier the radar showed good weather the next day. I decided to leave in the morning rather than risking the icy roads. I wasn't happy about it, I somehow felt stupid for my decisions, though I was unsure of how else I could have acted. Reluctantly, I set myself to working before settling in for the night, trying to distract myself from my growing anxiety.

Before I knew it the sun had set, blanketing the island in inky darkness. I was washing up after a hasty dinner when a loud thud echoed from somewhere across the building. Walking through the mess hall and into the main room, nothing looked out of place. Something falling wasn't out of the question, one of the old mounted deer heads had detached from the wall once and nearly impaled a counselor, so I was on the lookout for something like that.

Finding nothing, I was about to give up and go back to my business when I heard another thud at the front door. After another moment a sharp rapping rang out from the door and my mind jumped to the stranger from earlier. Was she out there looking for me? I really shouldn't have said anything about where I worked, this was the only summer camp around, and it wasn't exactly hidden.

Not wanting to be seen, I pulled back the curtain as little as I could and took a cautious peek out of the window. Whoever it was seemed to be a man, and werent obviously armed. They were dressed in ragged day clothes, jeans and a flannel shirt, and were a head shorter than me. Their face was obscured by a scarf, wrapped all around their head. 

They weren't dressed for the weather, and their beat up clothes wouldn't help against the subzero temperatures outside. My worry for their safety overtook, and I opened the door a crack, allowing the light from inside to spill out onto them. The wind was blowing fast outside and I was hit by a blast of cold air. “You alright out there? Not a good idea to be out wandering around in the cold, you lost or something?”

Leaning against the doorframe, head hung low, the man spoke, his voice hoarse and low as if he had something caught in his throat. “Ugh, a bit. Thank Christ someones here, was starting to worry I’d keel over before I found shelter. You mind if I come in? Feels like my face is about to fall off out here.”

Opening the door wider I gestured toward the couch. “Come in, sit down, please. How long were you out there?

Entering the lodge he slumped down, sinking into the couch and clearing his throat a few times. I stood next to him, and was hit by a wave of some horrible stench. He smelled awful, like he’d just crawled out of a damn dumpster. I swallowed hard, pushing away my apprehensions. “You don't look too good, do you need help, should I call someone?”

Waving a dismissive hand he said, “No no no, you don't need to call anyone, just gotta catch my breath, warm up a bit.” He looked up at me and spoke again. “And really, I'm not sure how long I was out there, but,” He paused, his glassy, tired eyes seeming to focus on me.

“Wait, Daniel? That you kid? Hell, I could hardly see you through the cloth. Hold on- Let me just-” Struggling, he pulled the scarf from around his head to reveal his sallow, beaten face. He was covered in bruises and cuts, his nose a dark, purplish black, frostbitten beyond belief. Pulling myself out of my shock at the man's injuries and smell, I saw the battered face of Richard. 

My neighbor Richard. My friend Richard. The same man who I'd meant to meet, but whose house was inhabited by a gun toting lunatic. The lunatic that said she’d never seen him before. The lunatic that wanted me gone, bad enough to threaten me at gunpoint. I assumed he'd moved, sold the place, passed even and had it sold by the inheritor, but he sat right before me, looking and smelling like he just dragged himself out of hell. He didn't sound like himself at first, voice rough and full of phlegm, but it was him.

I just stood there, mouth agape trying to form the words. “Richard- what? What? The hell are you doing out here? There's someone in your house and your- your out wandering in the damn woods? And your face! Fuck me, how long were you out there? Your nose is black, Richard! I need to call you an ambulance right now-”

“Woah there kid, slow down now. Look, there's no need to get all worked up.” He said.

“Slow down? No way in hell Richard, you need to tell me what happened. Why are you out here? I had a real nerve wracking interaction with someone, in your own damn house mind you, and to be honest I'm worried for the both of us. The hell happened to you?”

He sat for a while before speaking, staring at nothing and appearing deep in thought. “Okay, alright. I’ll try but it's all a bit foggy. I remember, well I remember waking up to something, a noise, a crash I think. Middle of the night, something, I thought something fell. Went to check, next thing I remember is, that's right, she pulled a gun, beat me, I blacked out and woke up in a ditch covered in snow, head hurting something awful. Yesterday, I think. The day before? Hell, I don't know, kid, it's all a mess. I can't think straight.” He said, slumping back on the couch.

“Richard I’ll call you an ambulance, call the police, get you the hell out of here. You'll be okay. I'll call right now, get you to a hospital and get your damn house back.”

I reached into my pocket to pull out my phone, when his hand shot from his side and latched to my wrist in an icy, iron grip. “Wait. Daniel look, that can wait, okay? Could you get me something first?”

“Right, sure, of course. What do you need?”

“I just gotta warm up a bit more, you got a heater? Could start a fire maybe?” 

We did have a few old space heaters stored in the basement somewhere, it’d be easier than getting a fire going. “Right, yeah a heater. I can get that. Just sit tight and I’ll be right back.”

He released his grasp on my wrist. His outstretched hand quivered, the fingers had a tinge of blackened skin on them as well. The sight sprung me into action, I rushed to the kitchen and headed down the basement stairs to get everything.

I was a few minutes into rummaging through old boxes and shelves when I heard a long creak from the basement stairs. Turning, I saw that Richard had stopped dead in his tracks a few steps from the bottom, staring at me.

“Richard? You alright?”

“Uh, Right I,” He paused, staring off for a second. “I thought maybe I could call the police, to make things faster. Just give me your phone and I can call.” 

I could only shake my head. “Richard, it's fine. Go back upstairs, I can call okay? You need to rest, get the cold out of your bones. Go lay down.”

He stood there for a moment longer, staring at me before grumbling and going back upstairs. After finding what I was looking for, I headed back up into the kitchen towards the main room, carrying a bundle of blankets and supplies for him, calling out as I went. “Richard, I’ll need to soak that frostbite before I put any heat on it, if I just hit you with the heater you’ll get hurt even more. I've got a first aid kit here so I can-'' The room was empty. “Hey? Where’d you go? Richard?”  

I was about to start searching for him when a cold draft of air hit me. Peering down the dark hallway at the other end of the room, I saw that the back door was wide open. Worried, I approached. I was relieved to see that no footprints had been left in the snow outside, meaning he was still in the house somewhere. I assumed he was still confused from the cold, likely hypothermic and not thinking clearly. I went to close the back door, but the groan of old hinges echoed from behind, halting me. Slowly turning, I called out into the darkened room opposite the open backdoor. "Richard? You there?" 

Had the wind blown it open? The air didnt feel that strong but the door opened by itself. Eyes straining, I peered through the doorway. The shadows in the room didn't feel empty, and reaching behind me, feeling for the switch by the back door, I flooded the hall with light. 

Richard stood in the room, a few feet back from the doorway, leering at me. The light from the hall cast him in an odd way, accentuating his disheveled features. The light should have caught his eyes, reflecting off them, but they held a dull, shineless look, like all the light was just lost.

Taking a long, worried breath in, I was once again hit by his damn smell. Wracked by a wave of some hateful, rot tinged odor, I retched. Stepping back and swallowing hard in an effort to keep down the bile welling up, I spoke through gritted teeth. “Richard? You alright?”

His chapped lips twisted upwards into a slight grin. “Why don't you turn around and close that door, Daniel? It's real cold out there.”

“Richard you’re hypothermic, you said it yourself you're not thinking straight. Go lay down.” My heart pounded, something about the look on his face disconcerted me in a way that I couldn't place. He took a step forward into the doorway. 

“Turn around and close the door, Daniel, you wouldn't want to let the cold in would you? Just turn around.”

I reached for my coat pocket, not breaking my gaze. “I’m gonna call you an ambulance Richard, just calm down, you're delirious. I'm gonna to get you some help.” My eyes left him for a split second to unlock my phone, and when I did, he lunged, catching me by surprise and tackling me backwards out of the open door. The phone flew from my hand and my head slammed back, cracking against the frozen ground. A sharp wave of pain shot through my skull and my vision flashed white before my eyes.

I made a feeble attempt to scramble backwards, but he pinned me to the ground, knees digging into my stomach knocking the wind out of my lungs. Drawing back, he layed a single, hard punch into the side of my face, breaking the little composure I had left. Leaving me helpless on the ground, head spinning and ears ringing, he sat up, peering at me with a cocked head.

He dug around with his hand in the snow, his chap lipped grin growing wider as he appeared to find what he was looking for. He waved my phone in front of my face, then gripped it with both hands and bent it in half before throwing it off into the woods. 

Still braced against me, he spoke with a sneer. “I thought you’d put up more of a fight than that. Looks like it was a good idea to let you tire yourself out before I showed up, huh? Quite the hard worker, aren't you? You’ll make a good addition.”

“Wha- what the fuck are you talking about? Richard what is this?” I sputtered, words slurring on the blood pooling in my mouth as I tried to speak.

His grin widened, baring a set of blackened, grimy teeth before speaking. “You keep calling me that name. I thought you’d remember your own friends way of talking, pick up on it, but I guess my little show held up pretty well. Lay on the pity, act all sad, and cold, and hurt, and everyone lets their guard down.”

Leaning forward, he placed both hands in a firm hold on my neck. His weight shifted, putting his entire body into the chokehold. I grasped at his wrists, trying with everything I could to get him off me, but the pressure on my throat was unrelenting.

“Don't struggle, there's no point in fighting this, all the adrenaline in the world couldn't save you now. Let go Daniel, you'll be in a better place soon.” He said, spitting his words, forcing his weight down even harder.

My head swam, but I still fought, using every ounce of force I had in an attempt to get the psychotic assailant off.

Over the sound of my own pounding heart I heard something in the distance. A low, droning growl met my ears, and it seemed to catch my attackers attention as well. He looked away, staring off into the night, never losing the grip on my neck.

“Sounds like an engine, maybe someones out there, hm? No matter, no ones coming for you Daniel, just give up. Let go.” 

Every passing second was a herculean effort. My vision began to blur, each heartbeat sending a painful throb through my head. I couldn't keep fighting, I felt myself getting weaker each moment and every muscle in my body wanted to give up. I nearly did, when something caught my eye.

A light, somewhere off in the woods, shone through the trees. The sound of the engine grew louder, the light growing brighter along with it. There was someone out there, and to my relief, someone coming this way.

Pushed on by the hope of rescue, I kept up my fight, just managing to remain conscious. The light grew nearer, the dark shadows of trees shifting as it moved. For a second, the noise of the engine stopped, before picking up again, louder, coming closer.

“Agh, damnit. Guess I was wrong then, huh?” He said, grip loosening slightly as he turned to look at the source of the light. “Now who might that be? Sit tight, you won't get far if you try to run.” The death grip on my throat loosened, and at last he let go, standing up to look off into the woods.

The engine had stopped again, and, straining my aching neck upwards, I could see a snowmobile or something had parked a ways away. A figure dismounted and approached, and while the intense beam of the headlights cast them in a silhouette, blinding me to their features, I could see them draw a pistol, aiming it towards Richard.

I almost expected him to rush the person, but instead he started pleading. “Don't shoot! Please, I need help, this man tried to attack me, I got the best of him but you have to help. He's lost his mind, went nuts on me and-”

He didn't have time to finish, an ear splitting crack along with a blinding flash of light erupted from the figure and stopped him dead in his tracks. 

He staggered backwards, losing his footing and landing next to me in the snow. Crunching footsteps approached, the figure coming into the lodge's light. They were clad in heavy duty winter clothing, face obscured by a mask, but Richard obviously recognized them.

"That wasn't very nice," He said, sitting up slightly and feeling around at the wound on his chest. "Should've guessed it'd be you sticking your nose in my business again. Y'know, you're starting to become a bit of a nuisance."

The figure trained their gun on him again. "Glad to hear it." They said, before another deafening gunshot split through the air, silencing him once and for all.

Flecks of something hot splattered across my face, and the lifeless body of Richard slumped on the ground beside me. The smell of rot grew unbearable, permeating over everything, and I felt on the verge of passing out. 

Before I could even begin to collect myself, a gloved hand gripped my collar and hoisted me up onto my shaky feet, and the barrel of a gun. They spoke again, almost shouting in my face. I could recognize the voice, being that of the stranger from earlier, and like at Richard's cabin their words were accompanied by the pressure of a gun to my head.

“What did he do? I saw him choking you but that's all I saw. Tell me what happened, now.” They said, twisting the barrel into my jaw.

I tried to speak, I wanted to, and I had a thousand things to say but none of them came out. I just stammered, my thoughts muddled by the pain, and the smell, and the ringing in my ears.

“I dont- I cant- you- you fucking shot him, and- and he, he tried- he was trying to kill me, like nothing. Lost his mind like nothing, or- or, fuck me i dont know. I dont know whats happening. Please, I just dont- I dont- I…” The damn smell kept distracting me, and I could feel the presence of the body at my feet. 

I tried not to look, I didn't want to, but I couldn't stop myself from glancing down at his lifeless body. The gaping wound on his head oozed, well, something. It wasn't blood, whatever it was. The harsh headlight out as some kind of dark, black substance seeping out into the snow. I couldn't take it anymore, the complete blur of events, accompanied with the endless awful smell, I just couldn't take it. I retched, heaving the contents of my stomach out onto the ground, onto both of our shoes. The gun dropped from my neck as they stepped back, which was relieving, but it didn't help, my head still swam in a slurry of pain and disgust. I just let go, slumping down onto my knees on the ground.

I guess I assumed that would be it, I was going to be shot dead right there, but the stranger just took a long breath in before speaking again. “How did he attack you? You need to tell me what he did”

I couldn't even talk, I just groaned and looked at the ground, trying to keep my eyes off the corpse beside me. The stranger sighed, and spoke, their voice softening slightly. “Okay, get up. Lets get you inside, get you cleaned up, then you can talk. Up.”

I peered up, at their outstretched hand reaching down towards me. I didn't know what else to do, so I took it, and was once again lifted up onto my feet. Inside I managed to scrub the flecks of black stuff off my face, before sinking down into an old chair. They stood a few feet away, looking down at me.

“Alright, phone, wallet, keys. Set them on the table if you have them. Then you need to answer my question, how did he attack you?”

I sat for a while, trying to collect myself before I drew my wallet and keys and put them on the table in front of me, but when I went for my phone I remembered that it was ruined and thrown off in the woods.

“He- Well he threw me to the ground, hit me, choked me. Would’ve killed me if he didn't stop. I dont even have my phone, he broke it and threw it off into the snow somewhere.”

“Did he break the skin when he attacked you? Transfer any bodily fluids to you? Did anything get in your mouth? Your eyes? Your nose?

“I don't think- I mean, why? I don't think any of that happened but what does that matter? Seems like you know something I dont and Id love an explanation." I said, looking up. They just shook their head.

“Doesn't matter, if you don't remember it happening then there's nothing else to do. Stay here, Ill be right back.” They said, before swiping the keys off the table and disappearing into the lodge. After a few minutes they returned.

“Up. Follow me.” They said, and again I obliged, not being in any real position to object. They led me to one of the smaller rooms in the building, lined with shelves and dusty furniture. I was ushered in, the door locked behind me, and I leaned against the far wall, allowing myself to slide down to sit. A little while later they opened the door to throw in an old sleeping bag and pillow, instructing me to “Keep back from the door if I wanted to keep my head.”

And here I am, writing this. She saved my life I suppose, but i dont feel good about any of this. I guess I’ve gotten everything that happened down, it's still a blur, but here it is. If I'm alive to speak upon it further, I will, but then again I highly doubt this'll reach anyone. I tried sending it out once and it buffered for half an hour, so i just wracked my brains and added more, well see what happens when I leave it overnight. Im tired, scared, confused, and my fucking neck hurts. Wish me luck.
