When the house burned, the fire department came quickly. Not as quickly as the neighbors who came to watch, though. Not quickly enough to save the people inside. Just quickly enough to drown the house in a torrent of water, leaving only charred remains and plumes of smoke, lazily rising up to heaven. 

\*

I woke up to the blare of fire trucks, slowly crescendoing in volume, pushing me further and further from sleep. The sound was loud and awful, until it stopped, which was worse. The air smelled faintly of barbeque. With a tingling fright I made my way to the window, with the crust on my eyes like glue, trying to keep my eyes shut. I saw the fire. I saw the crowd gathered to watch. I wished to join them, but the thought that there may still be people inside rescinded that idea. I didn’t want to watch people burn alive. Or, more accurately, I didn’t want to be seen watching that. So I pulled a chair up to the window and locked the blinds halfway open and watched.

As morning came, the firemen were lazily cleaning up the scene. They must’ve been tired. The crowd had dissipated, the neighbors all gone to sleep.

\*

The story took on the moniker of a simple tragedy. Candles left unguarded for the night. Five dead–a family–reportedly in their sleep from the smoke. Not the worst outcome, then. 

As the story was regurgitated by the news over the following weeks, something felt off about it. The reporters somehow found no new details, and the officials’ faces were masked with a somber look that seemed rehearsed and duplicated.

And every day, I’d see the blackened house, or what was left of it. Right at my fingertips, just at the end of the street. The yellow tape surrounding the property a warning of trespassing rather than an actual deterrent. 

I’d felt judgmental of the neighbors for gawking at the scene as it unfolded–not that I was any better, really–but the creeping feeling that I’d missed out on something was tampering with that judgement. I realized that I didn’t actually know *who* lived in that house, or who the neighbors were. *My* neighbors. I knew the story better from the news even though I’d watched it all happen. Something bad had happened in our community, and I wasn’t a part of it. Not in any real sense. And what harm could there be for me to have a look?

\*

I decided to go under the cover of night. It was unlikely that my small flashlight would alert anyone to me being there. The walk there was brisk, although if anyone had seen me I probably would’ve looked like I was up to something. I kept checking over my shoulder, even though I knew nobody would probably *actually* care about what I was doing, even if they knew. 

The house was two stories high. *Used* to be two stories. As it stood in front of me, it was more like one and a half, as parts of the roof and most of the inside were crumbled into piles and pillars of burned wood. The bottom half of the door was still clinging to its hinges. Barely. The fact that the house could, at any moment, take its leave and fall upon itself started to itch at the back of my mind. It wasn’t safe, but something kept me going. Maybe it was a need to know–so if I was ever asked about it I could say, *yeah* *I’ve been there. Yup, inside the house that burned down and five people died. Yeah, it was really awful.*

As I took my first step inside, I could *feel* the house. Feel the family that used to live there. Used to live at all.

The wooden floor was curved from the heat and moisture, scattered with all their belongings, trashed into pieces of glass and ceramics and dust that screeched under my feet as I explored. Every step felt different, and I had to be careful not to step on something that could slice my feet up. 

Besides the unevenness of the floor, the house was monotone in the black that coated every inch of the walls, stairs, and the half-roof. My light shone on the cracks between the dark wood, the scars of the house. All that had made the house a home was gone, swallowed by the flames: curtains; rugs; towels; clothes. It looked like a mess, yet not *messy*: like something that’s far from human had interrupted time itself and made its mark on this particular spot.

As I made my way further into the house–I decided not to even try the upstairs–I found myself upon an opening leading down underground. A peculiar, frigid damp wafted up the stairs, dragging me towards it to escape the smokiness of the first floor. It wasn’t uncommon to have a cellar in these types of old houses, though. When I shone my flashlight down, it couldn’t reach the bottom. Just a bland, narrow staircase leading down into pure darkness. 

I took a step back to think about it. The rational part of my mind told me to get out, that I’d seen enough. But the other part–the one that wished to *know*–seemed to already declare its victory. I was going to go down there. But there was a third part as well, something atavistic and old and simple, that said: *there’s something wrong here*. *Stop. Go back. Go back NOW.*

But it wouldn’t tell me what that something was. A gut feeling begging to be trusted, with no evidence for its warning. Maybe it was the darkness; the inherent danger in exploring a cascading house; the fact that from the cellar, there was no way out.  

Like a bubble floating up to the surface, the reason emerged. And it was almost stupid, yet I couldn’t ignore it: *there was no door.*

What I mean is, the cellar door was completely *gone*. Not burned to pieces like the front door. Not nested among all the other things the house held on the piles of mess on the floor. The hinges were there, showing signs of use, so where the hell was it? Had the firemen taken it? Why would they take the door with them? The question was so painfully obvious that there should’ve been a painfully obvious answer. So why couldn’t I find it? 

The most reasonable answer I could come up with was that the door was down there, in the darkness. I placed my foot carefully on the first step, checking to see how sturdy it was, all the while I could hear that third voice echoing disappointment somewhere in the back of my mind. The stair seemed to be in good enough shape, so on I went, keeping the beam of the flashlight below to light the way. 

Although I didn’t count the steps, after a while it felt like I had taken too many. Cellars weren’t usually that deep, so I should’ve touched ground already. But every time I shone the flashlight into the depths, there were no new shapes. No horizon. The air was cold, and the thought of looking behind me to see how far up the doorway was suddenly appeared into my mind. It scared me, because I *knew* it would be too far away. That it wouldn’t quite make sense. And the only way to make sense was to find where the stairs ended - to give the infinite an end. 

With each new step came the creak of the wood, a signal that there was still more to go. I wanted to count them out, but I didn’t dare to. Fleeting thoughts proclaimed how silly the whole thing was, but my spine was stiff with fear. I stopped flicking the flashlight forward, keeping its tight beam only on the next step instead.

Relief came when it shone on something longer than a single stair. A stone or concrete floor, cracked and blistered by the earth creeping through from underneath like a miniature of tectonic activity forming the continents. 

Once I had my feet firmly planted on the cellar floor, I looked behind me. The faint glow of moonlight shone in from the too-small square of the missing cellar door atop the stairs.

I turned around to face the darkness again.

In front of me was a room that was too wide and too long for me to determine its dimensions.  Besides the stone walls radiating cold that connected to the bottom of the staircase, there was nothing but more darkness. I blurted out something obscene about my shitty flashlight to relieve the tension.

That third voice was no longer telling me to not go there. It wasn’t telling me to get out, either. It was *begging* for it, squeezing my veins and muscles in a desperate attempt to get me to leave. But it was a voice I’d learned to ignore over the years. The binary of fight-or-flight didn’t really exist in the modern world, and most fears were unfounded and unnecessary. And a creepy cellar was hardly a real danger. So I ignored it again and explored further.

Still keeping my wits about me, I trailed my hand on the left side wall, and began to slowly follow it. There was no way I’d go barging into the middle of the room with no idea of how big it was. 

It was easier to walk than it had been on the main floor. There was barely any litter, or even furniture or shelves or a laundry machine–anything one might find in a regular cellar. Just a cold, damp room that echoed with each step. 

*It echoes?*

Not like the hollow snap or slight vibration that comes from a room without a rug or curtains. The echo was much larger, like that from a large hall or a theatre. 

I stopped to listen. For a moment, the air was still. 

Then, a faint breeze whizzed somewhere afar, like the wind had found its way inside, deep into the earth where it did not belong. 

My ears turned hot when I heard a wet thump somewhere to my right. My fingers instantly clicked off the flashlight, as if making the decision by themselves.  

I stopped moving, suddenly aware of each body part, piece of clothing and breath that made a sound. Being so still while my mind flipped through every possibility felt horrible, like I was about to start violently shaking at any moment from the adrenaline. But I kept myself motionless and as quiet as I could, and tried to wade through my thoughts and the increasingly fast beating of my heart to listen.

Through the pounding in my ears, there came a sound like something being dragged or scraped across the floor. No, not scraped, it was too soft for that. Dragged, then. Was something being dragged by something else?

Noticing my breath coming in increasingly rapid intervals, I took autonomy of it and made myself breathe slowly. In and out it went as I listened, and my mind–scattered by fear and leading to no discernible conclusions–began to think of a way out. Retrace my steps slowly and quietly, or make a run for it? But what was I even running from?

Another dragging sound, this one closer. It was moving towards me. Had it seen my light, or perhaps heard me? In the darkness it was hard to tell. I felt like I was in danger, but what of, I couldn’t say. Clicking the flashlight on and making a run for it seemed like the best option. Call the cops or something, after, once I was outside. 

Something that was almost a whisper, frail and cold, came from the darkness. 

“Help–,” it said as something turned in my mind at the words, “–me.” And it clicked into place.

*There was still someone down here.*

I clicked on my flashlight and let my breath come back in waves. The beam was weak and shaky against the darkness as I tried to find the source of the sound. I would’ve passed over the woman if I hadn’t turned the light back to look, because she wasn’t lying on the ground as I suspected. She was standing. My mind recoiled, turning back all the previous what-ifs and tried to make sense of what I was seeing. Then it stopped and, against my wishes, cold fear was pumped into my veins.

The woman was much taller than anyone I’d ever seen, her eyes like glass looking down on me, even from a distance. Her body was like the plague–scattered with something that looked like black mold, bumpy from cysts and in some spots concave from rot that had eaten its way inside her. Black hair, greasy enough to form loose spikes, grazed her shoulders. Her arms went well below her knees, the joints and bones not quite aligning the way they should. Yet it was obvious that what stood before me was a woman, or something that had formed itself based on one. 

When she smiled, a warm, comforting wetness spread in my groin, trickling down my leg.

The woman lunged at me with great speed, so fast that I couldn’t even turn before she had her long, slick fingers lodged underneath my armpits. The world fell away as the ground vanished beneath my feet, the flashlight dropping down with a rattle. I could feel her more than I could see her, as the faint, ambient glow of the flashlight was barely enough to differentiate the woman’s form from the darkness surrounding her. 

Her glassy eyes flickered as if telling me where to look. Utterly defeated, reduced down to primal wants and needs, I obliged. 

“Bring… them… back,” she said, each word holding anger like firecrackers sizzling, ready to pop.

I tried to answer, yet even as I opened my mouth, my tongue was frozen like a kitten grabbed by the nape of its neck. The woman’s eyes kept locked on mine, and I tried to think–to bring myself back to some coherent version of myself.

“Bring,” the woman said, spittle coating my face. 

“them,”

“BACK!” 

The shout echoed like lightning as fear brewed itself into a concoction of pure adrenaline and strength. But I was locked in. I had to think, to tell her the right words so she would let me go.

“Who?” I asked. “Who do I bring back?”

The woman’s eyes shifted down ever so slightly, then returned back to stare. “The ones who burned me. Burned *us,*” she said, the words sizzling like a rattlesnake.

“Who burned you?” I asked, the answer suddenly so obvious it straightened my spine and brought my limp body back to tension. 

The woman dropped me back down, and the sudden gravity felt almost painful. My armpits ached with tomorrow’s bruises. 

“Bring them back,” she said. 

“Okay. Okay, I will. I’ll bring them back.”

With a final look like a splinter under the skin, she turned and rejoined the darkness. I let out a long breath like safety itself as I grabbed my flashlight back up, careful not to point it at the darkness beyond. My body ached as I made my way back to the stairs, the warmth of windy air returning with each [step](https://wintersnoah.wordpress.com).
