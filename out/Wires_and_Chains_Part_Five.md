The fortress seemed quieter now, the usual bustle of activity muted as if the walls themselves had absorbed the weight of what had just happened. My eyes drifted to a soldier standing nearby, and something inside me compelled me to act.

“You,” I called out sharply. “Brad, come here.”

The man turned to me, his expression confused. “My name is Arnold, sir.”

I scoffed, waving a hand dismissively. “No, it’s Brad.”

For a moment, he hesitated, his brow furrowing as if trying to reconcile what I had said with his own identity. Then I saw it—his expression softened, the confusion melting away as his mind seemed to reorient itself.

“Of course, sir,” he said with a faint smile. “My mother always loved the name. That’s why she named me Brad.”

The response sent a chill down my spine. I hadn’t meant it. I hadn’t tried to change him, not really. But it had happened all the same, effortlessly and without question.

“Good, Brad,” I said, my voice tight as I fought to keep my composure. “I have a task for you.”

“Anything, my lord,” he said, standing straighter, the new name seeming to fit him already.

I glanced down and saw the pipes lying on the floor where I had dropped them. The sight of them stirred something deep in my chest—a weight, a presence I couldn’t ignore. I knelt slowly, picking them up. The cool metal felt heavier now, more significant, as if they carried the weight of everything I had done and everything I had yet to face.

Straightening, I turned back to Brad. “Find me a priestess of Naamah. I seek entry to her palace.”

Brad hesitated only briefly before nodding. “Yes, my lord. Right away.”

As he turned to carry out my command, I remained rooted in place, gripping the pipes tightly. My decision wasn’t fully formed, but the words had spilled out before I could stop them.

I needed answers.

I needed to see her palace.

I stood in the dimly lit hall, the weight of the pipes heavy in my hand, when the doors creaked open behind me. I turned to see Gregory and Tianna stepping in, their expressions a mix of wariness and exhaustion. Gregory’s face was lined with tension, his usual confidence tempered, while Tianna’s sharp eyes scanned the room like she was expecting a fight.

For a moment, none of us said anything. The air between us was thick with tension, the weight of unspoken words pressing down on all of us.

“You’ve built quite the fortress,” Gregory said at last, his voice carrying a hint of dry sarcasm.

“Yeah,” I replied, my tone flat. “Didn’t expect to see you two here, though. I thought you’d cut me loose for good.”

Tianna’s gaze flickered, something between guilt and defensiveness crossing her face. “We didn’t have a choice, Glenn. That thing in the forest—it was either leave you behind or let all of us get taken.”

“You didn’t have a choice,” I repeated, bitterness creeping into my voice. “That’s the line you’re going with?”

Gregory stepped forward, his jaw tight. “Look, you don’t get it. We had to run. We barely made it out ourselves. If we’d stayed—”

“You’d have ended up like me,” I interrupted, my voice rising. “A leshy. Another monster patrolling this nightmare of a world. Except I didn’t stay, did I? I fought. I clawed my way back. Alone.”

The words hung in the air, sharp and cutting. Tianna took a step closer, her voice softer now. “We didn’t know, Glenn. We thought… we thought you were gone. That there was no saving you.”

“And what? Now you’ve changed your mind?” I snapped, the bitterness spilling out. “You didn’t care enough to stay, but now that I’ve got a fortress and an army, you come crawling back?”

“That’s not fair,” Gregory said, his voice sharp. “You think we wanted to leave you? Do you think we didn’t feel like cowards for it? You think it didn’t tear us up inside?”

I opened my mouth to retort, but the look in his eyes stopped me. There was pain there—real, raw pain.

“We’ve been searching for a way out ever since,” Tianna said, her tone quieter now. “We’ve risked everything trying to find answers, trying to find you.”

I looked between them, my anger faltering as their words sank in.

“You’ve been looking for me?” I asked, my voice softer.

“Of course we have,” Gregory said, his shoulders slumping. “We couldn’t just leave it like that. We knew what we did was wrong, but we thought… maybe we could make it right.”

The frustration simmered, but the fire had started to die down. I turned away, running a hand through my hair, the pipes cool against my palm.

“I was angry,” I admitted after a long pause, my voice low. “I’m still angry. But I get it. I know what this place does to people. And I can’t blame you for running when I might’ve done the same.”

Tianna stepped closer, her gaze steady. “We didn’t come here to fight, Glenn. We came here to help. If you’ll let us.”

I sighed, turning back to face them. “So what now? You expect me to just forgive and forget?”

“No,” Gregory said firmly. “But we can start over. Work together, like we did before. Maybe this time, we’ll actually get out of here.”

I stared at him for a long moment, the anger and betrayal still lingering in the back of my mind. But beneath it all, there was something else—relief.

Relief that I wasn’t alone anymore.

“Fine,” I said finally, my voice steady. “But don’t expect me to let it go overnight. You left me behind. That’s not something I’m going to forget anytime soon.”

“We wouldn’t expect you to,” Tianna said, her voice soft but resolute. “But we’ll prove ourselves to you. However long it takes.”

A silence settled between us, not quite comfortable but no longer hostile.

I glanced at the pipes in my hand, their weight feeling a little lighter now. Then I looked back at Gregory and Tianna, a faint smile tugging at the corners of my mouth.

“So,” I said, breaking the quiet. “You guys want to get out of here?”

Gregory grinned, and Tianna nodded, determination sparking in her eyes.

“Let’s do it,” Gregory said.

And for the first time in a long while, I felt like we had a chance.

Finally, Brad returned, guiding a robed figure into the chamber. The Priestess of Naamah stood before us, her presence commanding and serene. Her flowing crimson robes shimmered faintly, and her piercing gaze carried an unsettling mix of devotion and detachment.

I wasted no time.

Using the same technique that had bent this world’s reality to my will time and again, I began to speak. My words were calm but deliberate, weaving a narrative that pulled at her loyalty. I praised her wisdom, her insight, and her devotion, subtly suggesting that she had already seen the cracks in Naamah’s supposed paradise. I told her that her true purpose, her real purpose, was to guide us—not as servants of Naamah, but as agents of something greater.

Her stoic expression faltered. Slowly, I saw the shift—her confidence wavered, then collapsed entirely, her eyes lighting up with the fervor of someone who believed they’d discovered a higher truth.

“Of course,” she whispered, bowing her head. “You are right. I… I will serve you.”

I couldn’t help but glance at Gregory and Tianna. The shock on their faces was almost comical.

Gregory leaned in, muttering under his breath. “That must’ve been how Henry did it.”

I straightened, turning back to the priestess. “Tell us how to reach Naamah’s palace.”

Her explanation was both detailed and chilling, describing the trials and layers of deception woven into Naamah’s domain. But one thing was clear: we would not be able to slip in unnoticed.

When she finished, I stood silent for a moment, processing her words. Then the realization hit me.

“We’ll need an army,” I said.

Tianna folded her arms, raising an eyebrow. “You’ve got one. But they’re NPCs. Naamah could rewrite them with a thought.”

I hesitated, the truth of her words sinking in. But then, an idea struck me.

“No,” I said, turning toward the door. “Not if I make them more.”

The courtyard was packed. Every soldier, every warrior, every person loyal to the fortress stood assembled before me. Hundreds of them, all standing at attention, their weapons gleaming and their faces blank with unquestioning obedience.

I climbed the steps to the central platform, Gregory and Tianna trailing behind me. Gregory’s expression was skeptical, while Tianna watched in silence, her sharp gaze unwavering.

As I reached the top, I turned to face the crowd.

I poured everything I had into my words. I spoke of freedom, of purpose, of the strength they carried within them. I told them of the battle to come and the reason it mattered—not just for us, but for the world beyond.

The speech came from a place deeper than I expected, filled with raw conviction and hope. I finished with a call to arms, demanding not just their loyalty, but their belief.

When I was done, the courtyard was silent, the weight of my words hanging in the air.

Gregory leaned in, his voice low. “That was a good speech. But it doesn’t solve the problem that they’re NPCs. They’ll do what they’re told. Nothing more.”

I didn’t respond. Instead, I pulled the pipes from my belt.

Gregory stiffened, his eyes widening. “Glenn…”

I raised the pipes to my lips and began to play.

The tune poured out of me, a melody I didn’t consciously create but felt deep in my soul. It was a song of hope, of purpose, of freedom. Each note reflected what I wanted for them—not just soldiers, not just tools, but people with the power to choose.

The sound filled the courtyard, resonating off the walls, weaving through the crowd. I closed my eyes, letting the music guide me, trusting in its power.

When I finished, I lowered the pipes, my heart pounding. For a moment, nothing happened. The crowd remained still, their faces unreadable.

Then, one by one, the soldiers began to move—not mechanically, not as puppets, but with a spark of something new. I saw it in their eyes, in the way they stood taller, straighter, their expressions shifting to something closer to… awareness.

I didn’t know how I knew, but I did. The army wouldn’t turn. They were free from the script.

Gregory stared at them, then back at me, his jaw slack. “You did it,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

I nodded, my grip tightening on the pipes. “We have our way in. And now, we have the strength to use it.”

The march toward Naamah’s palace grew more grueling with each passing day. The terrain had changed dramatically—gone were the rolling hills and dense forests, replaced by jagged cliffs and sheer drops that seemed to stretch endlessly. By the third day, the air itself felt heavier, thick with an unnatural stillness that made every step harder than the last.

We left the bulk of the army behind, taking only a handful of trusted soldiers to scout ahead. The fewer people we brought into the unknown, the better our chances of avoiding attention—or so we thought.

The gorge came into view as we rounded a bend. It was an immense chasm, cutting through the land like a wound. The depths were impossible to see, the shadows below swallowing everything in their wake. The only way across was a rope bridge, ancient and weathered, its wooden planks warped and splintered with age.

Tianna knelt at the edge, inspecting the ropes that stretched across the abyss. “It’s… stable enough,” she said, though her hesitation was clear.

“Stable enough isn’t exactly comforting,” Gregory muttered, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. He glanced around, his eyes narrowing as they scanned the cliffs above. “This place feels wrong. Like we’re being watched.”

I didn’t respond, but I felt it too. The hair on the back of my neck prickled, and the oppressive silence of the gorge weighed heavily on my chest. Even the wind, faint as it was, seemed reluctant to disturb the stillness.

We crossed slowly, one at a time, the bridge creaking and swaying with every step. I kept my eyes forward, refusing to look down into the abyss. Behind me, the soldiers moved cautiously, their armor clinking softly as they held onto the ropes for balance.

When we reached the other side, the ground felt solid beneath my feet, but the unease didn’t lift. Tianna stayed close, her bow in hand, her movements tense and deliberate. Gregory lingered near the edge, his gaze fixed on the opposite cliff.

“This place is a death trap,” he muttered.

I nodded, my grip tightening on my weapon. “We’ll scout ahead, make sure it’s safe. Then we’ll bring the rest of the army through.”

We pressed on, the path narrowing as it hugged the edge of the gorge. The cliffs loomed high above us, their jagged faces casting long shadows that shifted as the sun dipped lower in the sky.

And then, the sound started.

It was faint at first, almost imperceptible—a soft clicking noise that echoed faintly through the gorge. I stopped, my heart skipping a beat as I strained to listen.

“Do you hear that?” Tianna asked, her voice low.

Gregory nodded, his expression hardening. “Yeah. And I don’t like it.”

The clicking grew louder, faster, like the sound of claws tapping against stone. It seemed to come from everywhere at once, reverberating through the gorge in a way that made it impossible to pinpoint the source.

“Stay sharp,” I said, my voice steady despite the growing tension in my chest.

We moved cautiously, every step deliberate as the sound grew closer. The soldiers gripped their weapons tightly, their eyes darting to the cliffs above.

And then the clicking stopped.

The sudden silence was deafening, the absence of sound more unsettling than the noise itself.

I glanced at Gregory and Tianna, their faces pale and tense. “What—”

A shadow moved high above us, and my words died in my throat.

Another shadow. And another.

Something massive shifted in the cliffs, dislodging a cascade of loose rocks that tumbled down toward the path.

The clicking resumed, louder and faster now, a chaotic symphony of noise that echoed through the gorge.

“Move!” Gregory barked, his voice cutting through the rising panic.

But it was too late.

She appeared.

Mama Webster descended from the cliffs like a nightmare made flesh, her massive body blotting out the sky. Her legs, long and segmented, moved with horrifying speed, their tips tapping against the stone with a rhythmic precision. Her fur glistened like wet tar, and her countless eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger that sent a chill down my spine.
