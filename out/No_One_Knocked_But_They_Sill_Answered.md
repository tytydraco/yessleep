Every day, at exactly 9:59am, My dad answers the door. The only problem with it is the fact that there is never any knock.

It started a couple of weeks ago. None of us (Myself, Mom, or Younger Brother) ever thought much of it.

My dad has always been a big prankster, loving to scare everyone he could at any time possible, but this was different. It didn’t make sense. His usual pranks involved a jump scare in a dark room, or a scary mask from Spirit Halloween, but never something this strange. His pranks never lasted this long, usually they were quick, and we all could get a good laugh at the end. This had gone on for weeks, and no one had laughed yet. 

I asked my mom about it, and she didn’t seem as bothered as I, “Oh, you know your father.” I do, and that’s why this is so strange. I went to talk to my brother about it, but we’ve never been that close, so it’s not that common for us to have serious conversations about our family. “He’s probably just messing with you, I haven’t even noticed it,” Is all I ever got from him, due to the fact he was too caught up in doom scrolling online. I tried to talk to my dad about it, but when I did, he didn’t even acknowledge me. Once I talked about anything else he would go right back to being normal dad again.  
  
After another week or two it became a normal thing. No one else seemed to care, so I stopped caring too. That was until one late night when I went to the bathroom. I had walked out, managing to navigate through the dark hallway, when I noticed someone standing at the door. It scared the hell out of me at first, thinking someone broke into our home, but then I realized it was just my mom. I think that scared me even more. She had answered the door, no knock was heard, but she answered. She closed the door, turned around, then began walking back to her room. I walked up to her, “Mom? Why were you at the door?” No response. I tapped her on her shoulder, and she turned to me. “Mom, are you okay?” She looked at me like I was crazy, “Go to sleep. What are you doing up this late?” She turned around, then went to her room.  
  
I didn’t sleep that night, how could I? I locked my bedroom door and sat staring at the ceiling until the sun came up. I waited until exactly 9:59am, that’s when I heard my dad’s footsteps walking towards the front door. I opened my bedroom door, making sure not to make a sound. I watched as my dad stood completely still, holding the door open, looking at nothing. In a moment of absolute stupidity, I decided in my horror movie character mind to get a quick picture. I looked down, opening my phone to the camera, when I looked back up my dad was staring right at me. No expression, just acknowledgment, he knew I was watching. My heart sank to my feet, he had never, not in 17 years, ever looked at me with no expression on his face.   
  
I wanted to talk to someone about this. My friends, my grandparents, but they would probably think I was crazy. It sounds crazy, and it is crazy, and my family made me feel crazy because none of them would talk about it. It would be one thing if they denied it, tried to make me think I was crazy for talking about it, but no. That was the worst part, If I said anything about it, they wouldn’t bat an eye. It was like I didn’t exist anytime I tried to ask about it. What really confused me was that my brother seemed to be in on it, but I hadn’t seen him answer the door. How did he know not to answer when I asked him about it? I kept asking myself that until one day I was walking to the kitchen, when I looked off to my left to see my brother standing at his bedroom door. He was holding open the door, looking at nothing. “Isiah?” I said, trying to get him out of his trance, he didn’t answer. Getting pissed off from this stupid joke, I walked up to the door. Standing right in front of my brother I loudly asked, “What is wrong with you?” He didn’t say anything at first. After a moment he looked me dead in the eyes, with almost a worried tone he said, “Move.” I’d never seen my brother so deathly serious. There was no way this could be a prank, the look in his eyes when he said it, the tone of his voice, the chill I got on the back of my neck. I walked back to where I was originally 

standing, and watched as my brother slowly closed his door. 

At this point I had lost all comfort, warmth, or trust from my family. It had been a month and they all kept up answering their doors. My dad at 9:59am, my mom at 2:59 am, and my brother at 5:59pm. Every day. Every. Single. Day. I had accepted it, I couldn’t stop them, so I tried to explain it to myself. I ended up with this: It was an enclosed hysteria, if you’ve ever heard of the Meowing Nuns, it’s something like that. My dad started it; maybe it was a prank at first, then it became a small quirk. I had to say something about it, opening the idea up to my mom, then my brother. Eventually it had become a common practice for the three of them. The problem with that explanation would mean, even though I was only worried for my dad, I had accidentally grouped the rest of my family into hysteria.   
  
When they weren’t talking to no one, they were completely normal. I thought maybe I could, again stupidly, ignore their quirk; maybe I could get past it and try to get back to having a normal life with my family. After a couple of weeks that had happened. I stopped noticing them when they answered their doors, it wasn’t my business. I had my normal family back. That was until last night. We were sitting at the dinner table, having a nice evening, eating KFC and talking about a show my dad liked when he was a kid. I was planning on hanging out with friends after dinner, so I checked the time to make sure I wouldn’t be late. 7:58 pm. I wouldn’t be late, and I had plenty of time to hang out with my family. Being my paranoid self, I took another look at the time to make sure I hadn’t read it wrong, just then I saw it change to 7:59 pm. As soon as the clock changed, I heard two stern knocks coming from my bedroom door. The room fell silent, as if time had stopped while the knocks waited for my reply. I wanted to ask them if they heard the knocks, but I knew where that road would lead. I heard the knocks again, louder this time. I knew there was only one option for me. I looked at my dad one last time, his eyes were pleading with me. He didn’t need to speak to let me know he was begging me to answer. I nervously got out of my chair and took the slow trek to my bedroom door. I was ready to grab then handle when I heard the knocks again, they were violent this time, impatient and angry. I opened the door.  
  
What I saw was a man, holding a simple sign. He looked impossible, but I could make out that he was a man, 6 foot tall, and completely silent. The sign read simply, “Say nothing. Go and eat.” I closed the door, then returned to my chair. When I sat down, my family instantly went back to normal conversation. For so long I wanted an explanation, and now I have one. I knew why my brother looked at me that way. If I saw him stand where he was standing, I would tell him to move too. I was now in on the hysteria, so I asked again. 

“Did anyone notice that?”

My family went quiet, then all at once turned to look at me. 

My mom, with all of her love behind her words, replied, “Stop.”
