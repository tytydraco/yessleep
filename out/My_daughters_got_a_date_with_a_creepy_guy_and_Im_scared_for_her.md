I didn’t understand teenage girls when I was a teenage boy, and that dynamic persists into fatherhood. My wife was able to act as a bridge between Donna and me, which left me helpless after our divorce. 

Kids are correct when they accuse parents of not knowing what we’re doing; we’re just trying to fake our way through it while minimizing our mistakes. A lucky few parents are confident enough to believe their own bullshit, but the rest of us are terrified at the knowledge that six thousand years of civilization rest on how badly we fuck up the generation that Fate or nature foolishly left to our care. 

“Out,” Donna answered without looking at me. 

“With whom?” I responded, folding my arms so that she couldn’t see my hands trembling. 

She looked at the ceiling and played with her fingertips. “Did you have something planned for us tonight?”

I balked at the question to which I didn’t have an answer.

She pursed her lips and nodded. “Tonight I’ll be okay on my own. I’m just looking to kill time until I go back to Mom’s tomorrow.”

I don’t know if she realized just how much that hurt.

I had no response. 

The awkward silence hung like a cloud. 

“A boy from school,” she sighed shoulders slumped. 

Frozen nausea tickled my throat as a hundred questions raced through my head. Had Denise talked to her about dating? About sex? Should I have this conversation with her? What would I even say? What would I tell her about safe sex? I don’t think I could bring myself to talk about those details with her if someone gave me a million dollars.

“Dad?” she asked, breaking me from my reverie.

“Um. Can I see a picture of him?”

Donna flashed me an exasperated look.

I went to fold my arms before remembering that they already were folded. Instead, I shifted my weight from one leg to the other. Yes, that would look authoritative. 

She rolled her eyes so far back that I could have sworn I heard them creak.

I didn’t move.

Then Donna reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone, keeping the screen very close as she flashed through her photos. She stopped, raised and lowered her shoulders in a heavy sigh, and held the phone out for me to see, but not touch. I braced myself.

Nausea flared through me like a kabob as she revealed a picture of a boy with his arms around her. He stared at the camera with a half-smirk on his sunken, alabaster face. He looked to be about nineteen, but his pinkish eyes could have been thirteen hundred years old.

“His name is Rau.”

I wanted to give an immediate ‘no.’ But the practical end of that action would be driving her further into his arms; nothing is more alluringly carnal than the knowledge that someone is off-limits. 

My deep, steadying breath almost hid how much I was shaking.

I forced a smile that Donna didn’t believe. “Just promise that he’ll drop you off back here on the porch, okay?”

Simple fear is an evolutionary holdover that dulls in adulthood: there’s good reason early humans feared insects, the dark, and isolation, but I like to say that I’m mostly over it. We do hold a fear of beings that are almost human but not quite, or should be human yet aren’t. That’s why clowns and werewolves are so terrifying. 

But none of that compares with the evolutionary terror that awakens *later* in life: the fear that we will fail to protect our children has kept us alive despite our best efforts to kill ourselves. That terror is far deeper than any clown with a spider leg for a tongue tickling us in the dark.

Which is why I was waiting just inside the front door with the porch light on and living room lights off for three hours. I wish I could have been bored, but an unquiet mind doesn’t have time for such indulgences. 

Every car that flew by sent my heart rate past 140. 

So I was almost ready to pass out when I heard a car door slam and two sets of footsteps walking toward my apartment. I peeked through the small window to see that Rau had his arm wrapped around my daughter’s waist in the same way that I’d always held Denise in that first year of dating as we embraced after putting our clothes back on. 

I felt my knuckles turning white as I squeezed the stick.

They got to the front door. Donna glanced at the window, but I’m 90% sure she couldn’t see me looking back. 

Then she turned back to Rau and smiled. He kissed her hungrily. 

I looked away. 

I took a deep breath.

Then I opened the door.

Rau looked at me as he gently pushed Donna behind him. He didn’t smile.

“Did you come to see her, or did you come to see me?” I asked in a heavy voice. 

“Dad!” she squeaked.

Rau ran his pale fingers through her hair. “Can’t blame a guy for being hungry,” he answered hoarsely.

“Oh my God, *Dad*, why are you doing this? Please just let me go back to Mom’s a night early and leave me alone.”

The last three words hit me like a stake in the heart. Children don’t know how profoundly they can hurt their parents.

Rau flashed a thin smile from ten feet away. “How about it?” he asked, his voice silky. “Will you back off?”

I squeezed tighter. “I can’t do that.”

“Dad,” she whimpered.

Rau nodded. “So be it.” He pulled Donna closer and lowered his jaw farther than any natural mouth could open as long, thin teeth dripped like needles from his gums.

We both knew I was too far away to intervene fast enough.

What Rau *didn’t* realize was that I was holding a long, thin piece of wood behind my back. I was tossing it to Donna as he prepared to bite. 

Her hand caught the stake in the same smooth motion that brought its tip into his cheekbone. A pale skin flap tore from Rau’s face as Donna’s strike deflected his bite, sending him staggering from the unexpected attack. As he released Donna, she stepped back and swung her newfound momentum into a half-circle, whipping the stake back around and directly into his chest, the tip erupting from his back. 

She released the weapon and covered her mouth in shock as he stumbled down the stairs and collapsed.

I ran toward them – but for the first time I can remember, I stopped short of confronting an attacker. 

I was certain that she’d ended the threat.

I held my daughter close and hugged her. She trembled. I kissed the top of her head. 

“Dad?” she whispered, staring down at Rau’s unmoving body. “Dad? *Dad?*” Each word got an octave higher.

When she was ready, Donna turned to face me. Her eyes conveyed a storm of thoughts – confusion, dread, and very, very deep below the surface, a glimmer of understanding.

“What the fuck just happened?” she whispered.

I squeezed her shoulders. “We’re hunters, Donna. My side of the family always has been.”

Her jaw fell as she continued to talk in a pitch that was just below the ‘only-dogs-can-hear-this’ threshold. “Hunters of what?”

“Vampires.”

“Oh.” She looked ready to pass out. “And – um – how did I do that thing with the wooden stick? I didn’t think before acting, my body just – did it.”

I looked down at her and smiled sadly. “I didn’t teach you how to walk, Donna, and you didn’t make a conscious decision to learn. I just watched as you figured out what you were always meant to do.” I sighed. “But that didn’t make me any less proud.”

She nodded absently. “So fighting and killing that-”

“Vampire.”

“Right, Rau was a vampire,” she answered in a distant voice. “So fighting and killing him is something I’m – sort of – programmed to do?”

“That’s a way of putting it.”

“And you knew that he was a vampire before I went out with him, before he and I-” she stopped herself and swallowed as she looked up at me with eyes that shined in the porch light. “How did you know I would be able to fight him off?”

I squeezed her shoulders once more, softer this time. “Parenthood is a process of letting go,” I answered. “Tonight, I knew that you would be [okay on your own](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”
