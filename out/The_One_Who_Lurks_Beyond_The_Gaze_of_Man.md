Have you ever been curious of the unknown? Maybe even entertained the thought that there are other beings out there? Well, that’s what I experienced. Say what you will about this but what I saw is something I’ll never forget.

It all started around late November early December. I was relaxing on discord with a few buddies of mine, discussing movies we had planned to see and games we looked forward to playing. It was one of our favorite past times to do together. It wasn’t long before the inevitability of sleeping slowly crept over us and we had gotten off call. As I closed my laptop, I heard these strange noises coming from outside of my window. They sounded like a trumpet? I’m not too sure how to exactly describe the sound. It sounded very distant so I didn’t feel the need to worry. I figured it was someone playing some kind of prank to scare people. People in my town are known to do that often. I ignored the thought of it and just drifted off to sleep.

However, I felt this chilly sensation all throughout my body. I awoke and was met with the night sky. My eyes widen as I shot up in a panic. Where the fuck was I?! It looked like a park but it was way too open. Maybe some kind of grassy field? Wherever I was I just wanted to get out. I got up to look at my surroundings, no woods, no houses, just.. nothing. I was completely freaked out but quickly decided that if I was to get out I would have to start walking. It felt like hours upon hours with how much walking I did but I eventually I saw some familiar surroundings. Then I saw the park and not long after that my home. I barged into the door and saw my mom and dad in the living room.

I shouted at them saying “Mom, Dad!” But… they didn’t hear me at all. I shouted again and again but they still couldn’t hear me. I ran up infront of them to try and see if I could do something to get them to notice me. I reached out to touch my father.. only to pass right through him. I was so utterly confused and scared by this revelation. What the fuck is going on? I ran back outside in a panic and I saw “it”. This trench coated figure that seemed to notice me. My eyes met back at his and he began to walk away.

I scrambled my thoughts together and chased after him. No matter how much I tried to keep up with him he was always ahead of me. As I chased after him I realized he was leading me back to that open field I awoke in. I tripped and fell into the grass pretty hard. I got up and the figure was right in front of me. I braced myself for my possible death but he just stood there look at me. “What are you doing here?” He spoke, his voice was pretty gravely. “I.. I don’t know..” I couldn’t really firm up a good response to his question. 

He let out a sigh and said to me “another one..” I raised an eyebrow at him. “W-what do you mean another one?” “You’re not the first one to enter this plain.” Plain? Like some kind of dimension? The thoughts I had popping in my head start to well up in me. “This a place where those who are passing reside before eventually going.” He said to me. “Passing? Like dead?” He didn’t say anything to me and just nodded. I couldn’t be dead could I? I was just fine hours ago. “I can see however that your time isn’t quite here yet. You have a long life to live.” I got up from the ground and stared at him. 

I had one question that I had to ask him. “What are you exactly?” I said as I reached to lift his trench coat away. His hand jerked up and grabbed my arm. I felt this burning sensation shooting you my arm. “Perhaps your mortal eyes aren’t ready for that kind of answer.” I was nervous and for second I thought he was gonna actually kill me. “Then can I at least get a name?” I asked. Stared at me and said “The One Who Lurks Beyond The Gaze Of Man.”

I suddenly awoke in my room. I shot up, my breath shaking, and my heart racing. I looked around just to be sure I was actually home. I felt the same burning sensation on my arm and I held it. The burn mark was still there on my arm. This freaked me out and I was questioning whether or not I was awake or even actually asleep. I got up from my bed and ran downstairs to see my parents in the same spots they were in. They saw me and had asked what happened. I didn’t respond and just hugged them as tight as I could. 

To this day I’m not exactly sure what it was that I saw… but I know that this will be with me forever.
