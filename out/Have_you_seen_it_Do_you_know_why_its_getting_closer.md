Hey there Reddit! Pardon me, Iâ€™m new, but Iâ€™ve got to ask have you seen what Iâ€™ve seen? Ever since I was little Iâ€™ve heard about the man we all, apparently, have dreamt about but have never seen in real life so I thought maybe a few have seen this guy too, though heâ€™s not in my dreams but maybe other women have seen him? It started when I, as my mom put it, became a woman, Iâ€™d cramp at night times horribly; waking up Iâ€™d grab my abdomen, as if that would help, and turn to the side facing my window. The first time I saw him, now I say him but thatâ€™s cause I call him buddy, anyways, I saw him in the tree line, about a mile or two from my window, honestly the only reason I could see him at all is that his whole body is a beautiful radiant white pearl color, in the moon light he practically glows!

Iâ€™ve seen him 4-7 days a month for the last 8 years, and every year he seems too grow closer. I noticed on my 21st birthday he was maybe 10 feet from my window, I can see every part of him now. His beautiful pearl skin is bright on his featureless body, as if someone hung a silk sheet over the body of a skeleton, his face, we will call it that though he lacks those features too, is always hung a bit sideways, as if heâ€™s a dog that hears a funny noise? Have you seen him? If so please comment! Heâ€™s quite funny sometimes.

I look forward to your replies I will have to read when my mom leaves for work, Iâ€™m not supposed to have a phone, or internet ðŸ˜¬ our community frowns upon it, but people sneak stuff in. 



Update! Hi, thank you all for your wonderful, and even the not so wonderful comments! Sorry itâ€™s been so long I had a crimsoning ceremony! Buddy is at my window! I finally asked my mom about him and she got really irritated that I had not told her sooner so she had to rush the ceremony. After the ceremony they answered all my questions about him, itâ€™s funny some have you have seen him too, since weâ€™re supposed to be the chosen ones and all that.

Update two! Hey sorry! For those asking what they told me about him, they said buddy is me(?) I donâ€™t really understand that part, but they said once he enters my room we will meet, and we will be one(?) not sure what they mean, maybe marriage? My friend Sue Ellen said she has a buddy too, and he was supposed to enter her room last week! Iâ€™ve seen her around, but sheâ€™s got no one with her? So maybe she was lying about it to make me jealous she gets to meet him first, sheâ€™s lost some weight, which could be because sheâ€™s trying to look fit for him at night ðŸ˜‰. Anyways mom said he should meet me next month! Iâ€™m so excited!!!


got to make this quick, Iâ€™m outside of Salem, please. I saw Sue, I went to grab her arm and it all fell off, her skin, it was in my hands! I could see the pearl skin underneath it. I screamed, when she, it, they(?) faced me her face! It was just hanging there, I donâ€™t want to be chosen. It was wearing her skin like a suit???? Please Iâ€™m running tonight. If you see me on the side of the highway I need help. I donâ€™t want to be a chosen one.
