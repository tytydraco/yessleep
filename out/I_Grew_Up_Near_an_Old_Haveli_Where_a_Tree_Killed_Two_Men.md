I grew up hearing elders say that some trees are not meant to be cut. At the time I thought it was just superstition. Now I know better.

This happened in a small village near the old zamindari belt of eastern Uttar Pradesh. There is a haveli there, more than three hundred years old, known locally as **Fell Kothi**, though no one remembers who Fell was anymore. The structure still stands. Thick walls, cracked lime plaster, wide verandas, and a massive peepal tree growing barely a few feet away from the upstairs bedroom window.

The locals don’t go near that tree.

According to village records, sometime around the late 1600s, an old woman named **Mata Sukhmani** lived on the outskirts of the village. She was a widow, childless, and survived on herbs, roots, and what little grain people gave her. Whenever livestock fell sick or a child recovered after being close to death, whispers followed. When a crop failed or someone died suddenly, the same whispers returned, louder.

On full moon nights, people claimed they saw her sitting inside the peepal tree near the haveli, murmuring to herself, cutting bits of bark with a rusted sickle. The then landlord, **Rao Madhav Singh**, testified that he saw her climb the tree outside his bedroom window more than once. He swore she stared straight into his room as if she knew he was watching.

The village panchayat declared her a dayan.

She was tied to a neem pole and beaten before being handed over to the authorities. She did not beg. She did not cry. As the noose was tightened, she screamed just one sentence.

“Mehmaan aayenge is ghar mein.”

There will be guests in this house.

Rao Madhav Singh died that very night.

The servants found him at dawn, lying stiff on his bed, skin blackened like charcoal. No wounds. No poison. The window wide open. The peepal tree branches brushing the sill.

The room was locked for decades after that.

Fast forward nearly fifty years.

The haveli passed on to Rao Madhav’s grandson, **Raghavendra Singh**, a man educated in Calcutta, rational, modern, and deeply irritated by village superstitions. He renovated parts of the house, reopened locked rooms, and dismissed every warning given to him.

When construction began to expand the village temple, old graves had to be moved. Mata Sukhmani’s burial site was opened.

It was empty.

No bones. No ash. Nothing.

Soon after, Raghavendra Singh began complaining of disturbed sleep. Curtains moving without wind. Smoke from lamps curling unnaturally. A sense of being watched from the window. One afternoon, while inspecting rooms for renovation, he unlocked his grandfather’s sealed bedroom.

The peepal tree stood right outside. Taller than ever. Hollow at its core.

That evening, a retired schoolteacher visited him carrying old handwritten notes passed down in his family. His grandfather had been the village pandit at the time of Mata Sukhmani’s execution.

One line was underlined again and again.

“Is vriksh ko kaat do.”

Cut this tree down.

Raghavendra laughed, opened a copy of the Ramcharitmanas kept in the room, and randomly read the first line his eyes fell upon.

“Pratah kaal tum mujhe na paoge.”

By morning, you will not find me.

That night, the servants heard a sound like something heavy dropping onto the floor upstairs. No scream. No struggle.

Raghavendra Singh was found dead on his bed before sunrise. Blackened. Twisted. As if drained.

The peepal tree was finally cut down that very day.

When the woodcutters broke into the hollow trunk, something fell out. Then another. Then another.

Creatures the size of large cats, hairy, grey, with too many legs to count, poured out shrieking. People ran. Some were beaten to death with lathis. Others burned as the tree caught fire.

When the smoke cleared, inside the burnt hollow, they found human bones.

An old woman’s skeleton.

Even today, nothing grows where that peepal tree once stood.

And villagers still say that on full moon nights, someone knocks from the outside of the locked bedroom window of Fell Kothi.

Waiting.
