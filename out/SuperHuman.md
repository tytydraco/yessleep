It started out one day... I picked up the bible and said "this time I am going to believe in God". I read the bible and smoked Marijuana (the habit they would use against me). Mind you I have had quite a drug experience from laced weed shadily given to me by a friend to frequent LSA and LSD trips to expand my mind. So maybe this is all just fantasy???

I decided to ask God to be able to control animals with my mind and become a psychic. It worked... Almost too well. I started hearing birds singing songs. Not bird songs, human songs... Perfectly matching with pre existing musical scales. This was summer 2013. I had no idea what was next.

After hearing random people come outside my house and say "this guy is a psychic" I started getting pretty annoyed. We're they talking about me? The sad truth was... they were.

It all happened within a matter of weeks. The birds started repeating every thought I had to my bitter annoyance. People were laughing at my thoughts even my most intimate moments were broadcast to the surrounding houses. I was peeved. Did I tell you at this point they had already locked me up in a mental hospital? They sent me in to take pills. Was I really schizophrenic? Paraniod that others could read my mind? Or was I being bullied and hazed? I think you know the truth no matter how atheist or straight edge you want to pretend you are. Something MAJOR had happened. 

I didn't get proof that I wasn't insane for a few years. Then one night I decided to try asking God something. "What time is my Dad coming home?"
"17 minutes" replied the bird. I waited 17 minutes and nothing. I was disappointed... I was really insane wasn't I? I waited in the dark woth no hope but to hear voice after endless voice until I died bitter and alone in my "mental health" misery. 

Then I heard my Dad pulling into the driveway. I looked at my watch out of hope that something would present itself as real... that I would know the truth. I looked and at exactly 10:17:00 PM he had  pulled into the driveway and turned off his car. Exaclty!!!

Eureka I found it!!!

As the years went by my view on reality and what God would give me changed. He gave me dreams showing my grand glory how I would be a king if I just trusted him. Along the same time I became interested in the law of attraction.

Surely God was showing me the missing part of the story which the bible could not explain due to the lack of context and cultural norms during and before the days of Jesus Christ. 

I started listening to affirmations and meditating trying everything all the while being unable to handle my psychic powers without fits of rage at the outright cruel things being said to me on a constant basis. But they are jealous whoever these other psychics were. I have a great life ahead of me and thier crimes of passion will be their end. 

After a certain amount of years the voices had become less. They were no longer as engaging no longer as bold. They had become nice... at least some of them. My compassion was growing I understood why the Buddhist practice mediation, compassion and affirmations my heart was so free. I was happy. 

Then tonight the singular most glorious night. I saw... I had asked God for something... and it came true or rather it was a taste of what was to come. 

I was sitting outside looking up at the night sky when I saw a plane. I looked at it casually asking God for super human powers (teleporation, telekinesis, time travel, etc). The I looked away from the plane and out of the corner of my eye I saw it stay in the same place. It hadn't moved at all. I looked back and it was in the same place as before and it suddenly started moving again. I di this several times I even counted to three multiple times testing by counting while I was looking and counting when I looked away. It never moved when I wasn't looking it only moved when I looked at it. 

I had just experienced time literally stopping.

You don't have to believe you can think this is all made up. But as for me #nosleep tonight.

Tonight is for celebration with the Lord.

For he always delivers!

Amen.
