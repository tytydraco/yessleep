I had just landed my job as a caretaker at a large mansion with overgrown vines. I had always been drawn to old houses, and the opportunity to live in one rent-free for a year was too good to pass up. I had no idea who the owners were until I arrived at the mansion and was greeted by my ex-boyfriend, Jack, and his new girlfriend, Lily. Jack and I broke up around a year ago and since then we never met each other.

At first, I was determined to be professional. The mansion was huge, and there was always something that needed cleaning or fixing. It kept me busy, which was good because everyday at night i would hear whispers come from the bathroom that I somehow ignored.

One day, while cleaning the bathroom, I noticed something strange about the mirror. It seemed to be behaving like liquid, rippling and shifting as if it were a pool of water. I couldn't explain it, but it gave me an eerie feeling. When I touched the mirror, my hand went right through it, and i felt a cold breeze coming from inside. My hand touched, what felt like some liquid that wasn't quite liquid, it felt like it was kind of semi-air and semi-water.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I opened the mirror door. To my surprise, I saw a dark void with flashes of spirits of previous owners screaming, "This is our house!" I was petrified and quickly shut the door, hoping it was all just my imagination. But then I heard a voice whispering my name, and I knew i wasn't alone. I went to bed that night and as soon as I slept I had a dream, where I saw that I was trapped by chains and an old person in old fashioned clothes slowly twisted my limbs and I couldn't move of scream, I suddenly then woke to find myself drenched in cold sweat and that night I couldn't sleep at all.

As the days went by, strange things started to happen around the mansion. Doors would slam shut on their own, and objects would move without anyone touching them. Even the bathroom started smelling like old room freshner that I smelled at my grandma's house when I was little. At night I would wake up to find my blanket lying on ground or the table lamp turned on , and in the light it gave off she could see what seemed to be fingerprints burnt into the wood of the table. I tried to ignore it all, but it was getting harder and harder to deny that something was not right.

One night, while I was asleep, I woke up to the sound of screaming. At first I thought I was having some kind of realistic dream but later realised it wasn't a dream and it came from the bathroom. I got out of bed and ran to the bathroom, where I found the mirror door open again. This time I understood that it was those spirits of the previous owners who were out of their imprisonment and wreaking havoc on the mansion.

I tried to run, but the spirits were everywhere, trapping mw inside. It was clear that the spirits wanted me to die in the house as well and were not going to stop until I was dead.

In the end, I managed to escape the mansion, shaken and traumatized by what I had experienced. I never went back to the mansion again, but the memory of the spirits and the dark void behind the bathroom mirror haunts me for years to come.
