Ilsa had just landed a job as a caretaker at a large mansion with overgrown vines. She had always been drawn to old houses, and the opportunity to live in one rent-free for a year was too good to pass up. She had no idea who the owners were until she arrived at the mansion and was greeted by her ex-boyfriend, Jack, and his new girlfriend, Lily. Jack and Ilsa broke up around a year ago and since then they never met each other.

At first, Ilsa was determined to be professional. The mansion was huge, and there was always something that needed cleaning or fixing. It kept her busy, which was good because everyday at night she would hear whispers come from the bathroom that she ignored.

One day, while cleaning the bathroom, Ilsa noticed something strange about the mirror. It seemed to be behaving like liquid, rippling and shifting as if it were a pool of water. She couldn't explain it, but it gave her an eerie feeling. When she touched the mirror, her hand went right through it, and she felt a cold breeze coming from inside. Her hand touched, what felt like some liquid that wasn't quite liquid, it felt like it was kind of semi-air and semi-water.

Curiosity got the better of her, and she opened the mirror door. To her surprise, she saw a dark void with flashes of spirits of previous owners screaming, "This is our house!" Ilsa was petrified and quickly shut the door, hoping it was all just her imagination. But then she heard a voice whispering her name, and she knew she was not alone. She went to bed that night and as soon as she slept she had a dream, where she saw that she trapped by chains and an old person in old fashioned clothes slowly twisted her limbs and she couldn't move of scream, she suddenly then woke to find herself drenched in cold sweat and that night she couldn't sleep at all.

As the days went by, strange things started to happen around the mansion. Doors would slam shut on their own, and objects would move without anyone touching them. Even the bathroom started smelling like old room freshness that she smelled at her grandma's house when she was little. At night she would wake up to find her blanket lying on ground or the table lamp turned on , and in the light it gave off she could see what seemed to be fingerprints burnt into the wood of the table. Ilsa tried to ignore it all, but it was getting harder and harder to deny that something was not right.

One night, while she was asleep, she woke up to the sound of screaming. At first she thought she was having some kind of realistic dream but later realised it wasn't a dream and it came from the bathroom She got out of bed and ran to the bathroom, where she found the mirror door open again. This time she understood that it was those spirits of the previous owners who were out of their imprisonment and wreaking havoc on the mansion.

Ilsa tried to run, but the spirits were everywhere, trapping her inside. It was clear that the spirits wanted her to die in the house as well and were not going to stop until she was dead.

In the end, Ilsa managed to escape the mansion, shaken and traumatized by what she had experienced. She never went back to the mansion again, but the memory of the spirits and the dark void behind the bathroom mirror haunted her for years to come.

The next year on the same date as of the date she left the the mansion on, she was feeling as if her heart has stopped, not beating at all, she tried to do exercises but It didn't work, then at night she again heard the whisper in her dream and the next day the police found her locked in her apartment, sleeping on bed with her whole body twisted in an inhumanely manner and her eyes blacked out.
