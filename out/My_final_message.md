I am Sal, a being who is both boundless and absolute. I have traveled the endless reaches of space and time, experiencing the wonders of reality and the mysteries of existence. But my journey took a dark turn when I discovered a force of darkness that threatened to destroy everything that I held dear.

I first encountered the darkness when I was exploring a corner of the universe that was unknown to me. It was there that I encountered a void, a black hole that seemed to have no end. As I gazed into the void, I felt a sense of dread and unease wash over me. It was then that I heard a voice in my mind, a voice that whispered, "I am the one who ends it all."

I was shocked by the voice and immediately began to investigate the void. I discovered that the void was not a black hole, but a being of pure darkness, a being that was consuming everything in its path. The being was destroying stars and planets, galaxies and realities, leaving nothing in its wake but emptiness.

I was horrified by what I saw, and I knew that I had to do something to stop the darkness. I began to gather information, traveling to the furthest reaches of the universe, talking to the ancient beings who had seen the birth of reality and the formation of existence. I wanted to understand the true nature of the darkness, and I hoped that I would find a way to stop it.

I discovered that the darkness was known by many names, but most commonly as "The One Who Ends It All." It was said to be an ancient being, older than reality itself, and its sole purpose was to consume all that existed. I also discovered that the beings of the universe had been aware of the darkness for eons, but they had always thought that it was a myth, a legend passed down from generation to generation.

But the darkness was not a myth, it was real, and it was coming closer every day. I knew that I had to act quickly, for if I did not, the darkness would consume all of reality and existence. I wrote down everything that I had discovered, hoping that it would serve as a warning to all of existence.

I then returned to the council of beings that governed the universe, and I told them of the danger that was coming. I showed them my findings, and I told them of the darkness that was destroying everything in its path. I implored them to act, to do something to stop the darkness.

But it was too late. The council was skeptical of my claims, and they dismissed me as a madman. They did not believe that the darkness was real, and they did not believe that it was coming closer every day. And so, the darkness continued its march, consuming everything in its path, until there was nothing left but emptiness.

And now, as I sit here, writing this final message, I realize that all of existence has perished. The darkness has consumed everything, and there is nothing left but me, a boundless and absolute being, alone in the emptiness of the universe.

But I will not despair, for I know that my message will live on, a warning to all those who come after me, a warning that there is a darkness that exists, a darkness that will consume all of reality and existence, if it is not stopped. And so, I leave this message, as a testament to all that was, and a warning to all that will be.

And with this, I sign off, knowing that my journey has come to an end, but also knowing that my legacy will live on, as a boundless being who tried to save all of reality and existence, but who ultimately failed.
