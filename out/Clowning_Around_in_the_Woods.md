Hopefully this is appropriate for this sub.  What I am about to tell you is a true story. I'm not making this up.

When I was a kid, my family lived in a neighborhood that backed up to a pretty good sized wooded area with lots of big green trees and foliage.  There were trails that weaved through the area between all the houses and back yards. I used to play a lot back there with the other neighborhood kids, running through the woods, climbing trees or swinging from vines and branches.  My mom had a small group of close friends from high school and college who all had children at about the same time as she did. My friend Jason was one of them. He and I were the same age and got to hang out quite often. We spent a lot of time playing with legos, trains, action figures, slot cars, hot wheels and other toys, as well as playing outside with tricycles, bicycles, scooters, and running around with our imaginations going wild. We spent a lot of time in the woods behind the house.  My family (Mom, Dad, little sister and I) moved away from there when I was about 7 years old, but we would still make trips back to visit friends and family, and I would get to see Jason every few years.  Sometimes we would drive through the neighborhood to see the old house again.  The woods always looked a lot smaller than how I remember seeing them as a kid, but I have very vivid memories of that place.

When I was in my early teens, on one of these visits with Jason, when we were alone, our parents and family in another room, he asked: "Do you remember that time when me and you saw a clown in the woods behind your old house?"  This question caught me off guard because I had no recollection of this happening.  Sounding very confused, I asked: "What? A clown in the woods?". I was puzzled, because if something like this happened to me as a child I'm sure I would've been traumatized and remembered it forever. He answered, "Yeah! We were running through the woods, just me and you, and went around a bend in the path, and there was a clown standing there, staring at us. We freaked out, turned around and ran all the way back to your house!" ... I've never been afraid of clowns.  Jason is definitely afraid of clowns.  I've always wondered why some people are, I know it's not uncommon. Maybe because of movies?  Anyway, as I mentioned before, we were kids and our imaginations would run wild, playing GI Joe in the woods, pretending to be Ninja Turtles or other superheroes.  I wasn't sure how much of Jason's memory was fabricated or embellished, like maybe something happened that I didn't think was a big deal, but to him it was.  I kind of brushed it off saying I didn't remember anything like that happening, and we continued to hang out until it was time to leave. Every once in a while the memory of him asking this question came back, making me wonder if some part of it were true. 

A few years later, a little bit further into my teens, we went back again to visit family and friends.  I got to see Jason again, and just like before, when we were alone, he asked: "Do you remember that time when we saw a clown in the woods behind your house?".  I answered: "Dude! I remember you asking me about that before, I don't remember anything like that happening, are you sure you're not just making it up?"  He said: "I swear to god it happened... We were running through the woods, just you and me. We came around a bend, and saw a clown standing there, staring at us. It freaked us out so badly we froze. I remember looking over at you and you were looking right back at me all wide eyed, we were both so scared that we ran back to your house as fast as we could!"  I sat there in silence, processing what he said. I don't know if it was my mind playing tricks on me, but this time I did have a faint recollection of this actually happening.  However, in my mind there's no way it could have been an actual person. I had a vision of one of those inflatable clown punching toys that would pop back up after you punch it over, looking half deflated and sad, hanging from a tree branch. I told Jason this, and that there's no way it could've been a real clown, and that his brain must be making things up. We were just kids after all.  He was adamant that this actually happened, and that it was a real clown, standing there in the woods staring at us. Eventually we moved on to another subject and didn't talk about it again.  

Many years later, in my mid 20s, my family made another trip back there.  Even as an adult, Jason brought it up again. The conversation this time was even shorter. I recall saying something like "That is so weird. I can't remember anything like that ever happening, but now that you've brought it up every time I visit, it's almost like it could have been real".  This stuck with me from then on.

Now, here I am at 40 years old. Every once in a while I think about Jason and the clown in the woods.  I'm not sure if my brain is manifesting memories, and I have no way of knowing if any part of his recollection is true, but there is definitely a faint memory in my mind that I can't deny.  Even though we are still connected via our parents, I haven't asked him about it since.  I wonder if he would remember.
