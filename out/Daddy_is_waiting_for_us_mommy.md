Im a 31 year old woman, I lost my husband when I was pregnant with our 1st child! My late-husband was a very sweet and a caring person, he would do anything to make sure others were happy and feeling good, but not to the point that he would be called “a people pleaser”.
My husband went missing for a year and later on they found his body in a shed that was placed in the deep of the woods.

When I found out that my husband was dead and my daughter would grow with no father figure in her life I was very devastated, I grieved his death for 3 years before I put myself in therapy, and decided to use my husband’s life insurance to pay for my higher education, I got a job in a very high paying company and now I live comfortably.

In my job I met a guy that was really genuine and a thing led to a thing and we ended up married after 5 months of being together 1 month of being engaged.

All this happiness went away when I found out that my sweet daughter was hit by a driver when she was leaving school, the panic I felt when i got the phone call from the school that they took her to the hospital was hundred times worse than the one I had when I learned that my late-husband was kidnapped.
Me and my current husband arrived as fast as we could, but sadly my daughter was in coma apparently she was hit very hard and her head got hit on the side walk.

The doctors couldn’t do anything other than stoping the bad bleeding from her head injury and fix some broken bones and ribs, the crash was severe and very serious since she is in-fact still young. 

Everyday i spent crying and praying for her to be better, until one day after six months when we were visiting, she was moving her fingers and a few weeks later she woke up from her coma.

We got her home and she was acting normal, but some of her actions reminded me of her father, which is weird and odd because she never met him, but i brush it off saying its just “genetics”.
It got very weird when she was constantly talking in her dreams like she was talking to someone, I tried taking her to a therapist but they said she was fine, I even took her to the priest and he said there isn’t anything he can help with it, saying its just dreams and it will eventually go, but I had this gut feeling that something is wrong.

Days went by and she started to fear going to sleep, saying that “they will get her”. It took me 2 hours to convince her that she will be okay and “mommy will be right here”; she slept well that night, and she was acting normal, I thought the dreams were over, but at the next night when I was tucking her in bed she innocently said “do you think daddy is waiting?” I paused for a minute and I remembered the night I found out he was dead and asked her, “what do you mean honey?” She smiled at me and said “daddy have been taking me somewhere in my dreams he said he was waiting to see me but then i woke up.” I knew she was talking about when was in a coma but then she continued “I was trying to come back home, but some scary guys followed me, hit me and took me somewhere, then they put me in a small house.” 

My heart was beating cold blood, shivers ran down my spine and I paused I didn’t know what to say, how does she know? How did she know these things? Why her? 

Then my daughter smiled at me and said “daddy is waiting for us mommy!”
