\*\*\*\*





I heard Mark scream at the same time that pain flared through my entire body, dropping me to my knees.  It had come from behind, so it had to be Mom, but what had she done…Gasping for breath, I turned toward Mark to see her over him, stabbing his neck with a hard jab of her fingertips.  He let out another wail and crumpled into a ball on the floor, whether because he couldn’t stand or just trying to avoid another attack.

 

She must have been satisfied at his collapse, because she turned toward me.  Her hand was still flat and pointed, and she raised her arm as though readying another impossibly fast strike at my neck or head.  There was no smile on her face now, just the hard focus of a predator in the moments before a kill.  A part of me feared that, but I was also distracted by how she had changed.  Some of it was her speed and movement—she had a quick precision to her motions now that reminded me more of a mantis than an older woman.

 

And then there was her skin.  It looked waxy and slick in places, maybe all over, but there were also wisps of…something…trailing off her skin at various places.  The first thought I had was that she’d walked through some cobwebs, but no, it was all over—thin, gauzy filaments clinging to her flesh like moss, shifting in the air with every sudden movement she made.  I was still staring at her when she lowered her hand and spoke to me.

 

“Are you going to behave?  Or do I have to hurt you like your brother?”

 

The mention of Mark broke me free from my terrified stupor enough to glare at her.  “Leave him alone.  Just please let us leave.”

 

Our father’s voice thundered out from above us.  “You aren’t going anywhere but the basement.  We’ve waited long enough.”  I looked up to see him standing over me, leering down with eyes that were pitiless and strange.  Between us, his grotesque member still stabbed out at the air, and below them, what might be his weakest point.

 

Gritting my teeth, I rammed my fist up into his testicles as hard as I could given the angle and the pain still flaring across my neck and shoulders.  He grunted slightly but didn’t stagger or even cry out, and when I tried to hit him again, he kicked me hard enough in the ribs that I felt something give way as new agony filled my left side.

 

“Want back in there?  That’s not the way.”  I heard him and Mom cackling as I started sliding across the carpet.  One of them had grabbed my legs, and when I looked around, I saw they were dragging Mark too.  I wanted to kick them off, get Mark and try to run again, but my limbs didn’t want to work and I couldn’t get any breath.  I thought about talking to them again, but I knew there was no point.  And Mark was so still, I was starting to wonder if she had knocked him out or even killed him.  Maybe it was better if she had.  We were almost to the basement, and…

 

Mark’s eyes sprang open as he twisted onto his back and kicked hard with both of his feet, landing them both squarely in Mom’s chest and sending her flying through the basement doorway and down the stairs.  Dad roared in anger, and I tried to use the chance to kick him too, but he just yanked me sideways into the wall while reaching down to grab one of Mark’s legs at the ankle.  His angry yelling curdled into laughter as he pulled Mark closer and then stomped down on his knee, breaking his leg backward at the joint as Mark squealed and fell silent.  Our father flung him down into the dark of the basement before grabbing me up again and following.

 

I was screaming, of course.  Threatening to kill them.  Crying.  Begging.  Doing all the things to reset a world that had gone insane.  I barely felt the rough slaps of the steps as I was drug down there, or the cold concrete at the edge of the ruin they’d created.  My eyes roved everywhere in the murky light of the basement, seeing more than I thought I would, more than I wanted.

 

That part of the house had once been for storage—boxes of decorations and old clothes, furniture that wasn’t needed but hadn’t been sold or given away.  Keepsakes and abandoned hobbies and reminders of bits of past life largely shed but not completely forsaken.

 

Now it was all destroyed.  Most had been shredded and beaten into a rough ring around the middle of the room, but as you went toward the center the scraps of cloth and paper, wood and metal, they all grew smaller and more fine.  Mounds of dirt and trash littered the middle, pressed down by use and black with filth and moisture, and I knew right away what it was.

 

*A nest.*

 

My eyes landed on Mark again.  Mom, bloodied but otherwise fine after her fall, had drug him into the center and was stripping away his clothes.  I tried to scream at them again, but all that came out was a small wheezing whine.  Please, God.  Please let him be dead already.

 

Our father came to stand over him as Mom receded to his head, stroking her youngest child’s brow as her husband got down on all fours.  Her skin was thick with that webby gauze now, almost like feathers in this dim light.  She started to sing, still stroking Mark’s hair like a loving mother as Dad’s face split apart.

 

It wasn’t his entire head, just the lower half, the jaw protruding and splitting apart at the chin, spreading wide to reveal black gums and two rows of grey molars on each side.  He paused a moment, looking up at me from beneath his bushy eyebrows, the same eyebrows Mark had always had, and he laughed at me.  At us.  At all of this.

 

And then he bent down to take a bite.

 

He went around Mark’s entire body—he bit through half of one thigh, ate the other foot.  Ate both hands and turned him over to tear off a buttock.   These weren’t savage or random attacks.  He sniffed deeply before nearly every bite, seemed to consider and sometimes he moved on to another spot.  Other times he seemed satisfied, and there he buried his teeth into my brother’s flesh.  It was only when he was chewing thoughtfully on one of Mark’s cheeks that his face began to run together again, and when he had swallowed the last, he looked at me again.

 

“This…this is all confusing for you.  Because all you know is taking.  Feeding on the life of the world around you, expecting everything, expecting us, to just give and give and give until we are dried up and you have moved on.”

 

Even if I could have spoken then, I wouldn’t have had any words.  My mind was almost completely gone, barely able to do more than record what was happening to burn it into my heart.  Snuffling, I only managed a small animal sound.

 

“Guh.”

 

Mom snickered as she stood up.  She’d stayed at her station while Dad ate his part, and now she was stripping down herself, peeling off wet pajamas to reveal sagging breasts cocooned in more thick strands stained red with my brother’s blood.  I had the thought that he hadn’t bled enough for all that had been taken, the desperate hope that it was because his heart had already stopped.

 

“We slow the blood.  Dead meat is worthless.”  This was our mother—Dad had gone to her old spot at Mark’s head as she stood naked near what remained of his legs.  “You are both worth far more than that, at least to us.  Your father has taken back from your brother—taken the places where the smell of his seed was strongest.  He’ll do the same to you.  Me too, of course.”  She looked down at the bloody ruin of her youngest with a small, almost shy, smile.  “But first I have to take my baby back.”

 

Spreading her legs wide, I saw the cleave between them grow, jagged yellow canines pushing out from between the lips and the broader fissure that ran up to her navel and lower back.  Crouching low like a spider, she began pulling him into her even as our father pushed and helped the feeding along.

 

I might have sat there, transfixed by that impossible horror until it was my turn.  But then something more terrible happened.

 

Mark opened his eyes.

 

He didn’t make a sound.  Just stared at me.  No, not stared.  He looked at me.  Saw me.  And begged me to look away.  To get away.  To let his let last sight be me escaping Hell.

 

I don’t remember getting up or making it out of the house without getting caught.  Maybe I was just too fast, or they couldn’t stop what they had started, or maybe they just didn’t care if they stopped me.  I know that I was over a hundred miles away when I came back to myself, screaming and crying behind the wheel of my car.  I was still stomping the pedal, but the engine was dead.  I’d run out of gas.

 

I got out and stumbled into the woods.  My side was still killing me, but adrenaline was keeping me going, even if I was too confused and terrified to make a plan or do anything but hide from every passing car.  That lasted for a few hours I think, though I’m not sure.  Then, one of the times I woke up from being asleep or unconscious, I could focus a bit more.  Enough to know I couldn’t stay there, that I needed to get to a hospital, that I wasn’t safe out there alone.

 

So I went back to the road and tried to flag down a car.  No one would stop.   Not that I blamed them given how I must have looked, but I had to get help, had to get farther away.  Gritting my teeth, I hit my fist into my thigh in frustration.  That’s when I first realized I still had my cell phone in my pants.

 

An hour later I was in an ER, trying to tell a believable lie about how I had fallen and tried to drive myself to a hospital but ran out of gas.  I don’t think anyone believed me, but between my concussion, broken ribs and punctured lung, they weren’t going to push it for the time being.  I was there for five days, and the entire time I was conscious I was terrified my parents were going to walk through the door.  Every time they dosed me or I fell asleep from exhaustion, I’d wake up certain I was back in that basement again.

 

On the sixth day I checked myself out.  The doctors and nurses didn’t like it, but I didn’t give them a choice.  I wasn’t safe there, and I had to be well-hidden before I could really sleep and try to get my head together.  There’d been no sign of my parents so far, and my phone had been silent except for a few friends from back home, but that didn’t mean anything.  They were still out there, and eventually they would come for me.

 

So I spent the next two weeks moving between different motels, slowly migrating back to my hometown without actually going home.  Once I was close enough, I spent a week watching my house for signs of them before I’d go near it.  The next week I went back to work, retelling my original lie to them that I’d been hit by a car while visiting family the month before.

 

I really was careful, and maybe it did actually help, I don’t know.  Looking back, it was stupid for me to try going back to my old life at all.  But you have to understand…I was so…so adrift.  Barely sane.  I’d halfway hold it together at work and then cry in my car on the way home.  I’d put locks on every door inside my house, but I still spent most nights sleeping in my locked closet with a shotgun next to me.

 

And that was just the trauma of what I remembered.  What was worse were the days when I thought I’d just gone crazy.  Imagined it all, or maybe hurt my parents or Mark in some kind of psychotic fit, imagining they were monsters and that they killed and ate him.  Didn’t that make more sense than what I remembered to be true?  And I hadn’t heard from Mark or our parents since, had I?  Maybe because they were all dead.

 

I almost called them several times.  Almost talked to the police once or twice.  In the end, it was the purity and clarity of my memories, the potency of that poison in not only my mind but my heart, that convinced me that it was the world that had gone insane.

 

Maybe that should have been comforting, but it wasn’t.  Instead of sleeping with my shotgun as my protector, I started cradling it like a lover.  Six months out, and I had already put the end of the barrel in my mouth twice.

 

It was that second time that did it.  Some remnant of that old anger came back, the thought that if I gave in, it was just them killing me slow.  Me letting them win.  Me letting Mark down.

 

So instead I went to a psychiatrist.  The first session I kept everything very vague and dishonest.  Second and third, more honest but no real details about some traumatic family “incident” in my recent past that was really bothering me.  Fourth session…it wasn’t because I trusted the guy that much more or even liked him.  But I had to get it out before…well, before it killed me.

 

So I told him about it.  Everything.  Everything I’ve told you so far.  And he listened, only interrupting once or twice to clarify something.  And when I was done, he studied me for better than a minute before clearing his throat.

 

“And…this…all of this you just told me.  You are being honest with me?  This all happened just like you said?  This isn’t some joke or test or…just a story?”

 

I shook my head, holding his gaze.  “I swear to God.  It all happened.”

 

He nodded.  “Okay.  Well, thank you for sharing that with me.  It’s, um, well, it’s a lot to take in, of course, and we’re just about out of time.  Let me process it and we’ll discuss next time, okay?”

 

I felt disappointment, but that was dwarfed by the release of telling it to someone else, even a practical stranger.  Smiling, I stood up.  “I…I’m really not crazy.  I just…thank you for listening.”

 

He stood up and returned my smile.  “Sure.  That’s what I’m here for.  See you soon.”

 

I was almost home when I saw the patrol car’s lights behind me.  I hadn’t thought I was speeding, but maybe I hadn’t been paying enough attention.  When the deputy came to the window, I could tell something more was wrong.  The doctor had called it in.  Said there was a strong chance I was a danger and that I needed emergency observation.

 

I could have tried fighting the deputy, but what would have been the point?  It would just let them keep me longer.  So I went along, as calm and rational acting as I could manage, and by that night I was in a psychiatric hospital.  Past me would have been terrified of even the idea of that, but now?  My pulse barely raised as a pleasant elderly orderly guided me down a series of halls to my room.

 

“…not too bad here.  And the food’s pretty good.  You’ll be fine.  Bet you’re out of here by the weekend.”  He turned to smile at me as he unlocked a door and gestured me in.  “Here’s your room.  Gertie will be by with dinner in about half an hour, and I’ll see if I can rustle you up some books or magazines.”

 

I nodded.  “Okay.  Thanks.  I may just sleep.”

 

He returned the nod and started to close the door.  “Well, keep your chin up.  It’ll turn out all right.”  His eyes brightened as he remembered something.  “Oh, and good news!  While you were getting processed, we got a call.  You’ve got visitors tomorrow.”

 

Jerking, I stared at him.  “What?”

 

“Yeah.  They told me right before I came to get you.  Your parents are [coming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Verastahl/).”
