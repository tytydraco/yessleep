This isn’t my story.

It’s Isaac's. Isaac was found dead in his living room on the 21st of April 2019. His death was ruled a suicide, but the state they found his body in told me and everyone else who saw it otherwise.

Isaac was smart, in every sense of the word. He was practically fluent in Python by the time he was 12 and managing a website our friend group would make shitty videos on at 14. The guy was naturally charismatic almost to a fault, he had this way with words where he could so easily talk his way into making you do exactly what he wanted which was more often than not, not what was best for him. he had this weird talent of always knowing exactly what you needed to hear and when you needed to hear it.

But there’s another side to Isaac though, the side you don’t talk about at funerals. To put it bluntly the idiotic side, Isaac was arrogant as hell. That natural intelligence he had made it so If he had his mind set on something there was no way of changing it. Which made him a nightmare at pub quizzes and incredibly hard to talk out of bad choices. Like the time he broke his collarbone when he was 15 whilst trying to hit the adequately named “ass smasher” jump at our local mountain biking range. Or the time he broke his collarbone for a second time on the same jump only 6 months later because he clearly had something to prove. 

Even though Isaac could be a bit of a moron sometimes, he was still my best mate.

At Least he used to be. The last time we spoke was in 2017, we didn’t just stop being friends out of nowhere people change and our wants in life started to differ. It also didn’t help that he had started dating my ex-girlfriend Alice and even at the ever so mature age of 22 the sight of the pair repulsed me. So we went our separate ways for me that meant backpacking through East Asia and for him and Alice it meant moving to the supposedly up-and-coming city of Cardiff.

I got a call from Alice about an hour after Isaac’s body had been found. Devastated is too light of a word to describe how she sounded. It took her about 5 minutes of pure uncontrollable sobbing to even muster the words.

“Isaacs dead”

Those two little words hit me like a truck, even though it had been years since we had last spoken my mind flashed to the kid I used to know mangled under the wheel of a drunk driver; the wannabe Steve Jobs I grew up with collapsed in his living room on a quiet Sunday morning; my old partner in crime bleeding out in a mugging gone wrong. Part of me wishes it was that simple, part of me wishes he had died like so many others in an unremarkable and unfortunately common way. Maybe if he had I wouldn’t have spent the last 5 years relieving someone else's last days alive.

Which brings me to why I’m posting here. I got a flight to Cardiff a few hours after Alice called and was there to stay with her throughout the remaining evening. A few days after I arrived Myself and Alice began clearing out Isaac’s house. He and Alice had broken up two months prior which is what led him to move to the musty shit hole he called home.

Most of the day was spent in a depressing cycle: Alice picks up one of Isaac's belongings; an old hoodie or his sticker-covered rolling tray, stares silently at it, then collapses in tears and I would then rush over to console her. We got to about round 4 of this depressing routine until I finally gave in and sent her home and packed the rest of Isaac's stuff alone. It was only an hour after Alice left when I finally made my way to the last room in the house, Isaac’s room.

The room was frozen at the exact moment Isaac had died. Although I don’t remember every detail from that bizarrely warm April evening I still remember exactly how I felt. I was in this weird fugue state like my mind couldn’t comprehend what was happening but my body could. I walked in, mindlessly putting Isaac's stuff in boxes amidst the pungent sea of week-old half-eaten take-out orders and the piles of dirty clothes. At one point, I’m not sure when Alice called to check in on me. 

Her words rung hollow, but I can’t blame her. I still can’t imagine how she felt. The false responsibility for her late ex-boyfriend’s so-called suicide she must have felt burdened with. I still truly admire her for being able to push through.

Our conversation was short but during this brief break from sorting through Isaac’s stash of useless techie crap, he had an affinity for collecting. I caught myself snapping out of my routine and noticing an out-of-place weathered black notebook with a golden spine amongst Isaac’s many compendiums of graphic novels.

It was Isaac’s diary. My obsession for the last 5 years. My reasoning for writing this post.

What will follow is Isaac's diary beginning with his first entry once he had moved out of his and Alice's flat up until his final entries that were written seemingly hours before he had died. I’m showing you all this as everywhere and everyone I've turned to has dismissed it as the last shreds of sanity of a deeply ill man. But I know it’s more than that. 

So I’m uploading here hoping that maybe there’s something one of you might have noticed that I didn’t. I need closure, not just for my friend's death but I need some kind of way of stopping this ceaseless nightmare of reading and re-reading and re-reading his writing over and over and over. 

For the sake of honesty, I will be copying the diary word for word however some areas may need clarification so I will interrupt where needed. I will also need to remove and change certain elements to ensure our privacy. Aside from that it is all accurate to how he wrote it. In addition to the actual diary there were numerous other scraps of paper slid into the pages of the book so I will attach them when they come up.

Without further ado here it is, Isaac's last days alive, written by the man himself. 

**31st of January 2019**

Fuck that bitch Alice and the high horse she rode in on. I should’ve fucking known she was gonna kicked me to the streets for some little prick big money publisher. Whore.

Finally found an affordable place to stay at, it’s this tiny bungalow, super musty and overgrown, vines or ivy or whatever you call it growing up the wall. The garden is a jungle, everything is overgrown and I don’t think the lawns have been mowed since the place was built. There's also a side alley that's locked with a keypad I don’t have the code to. I can’t complain though, the rent is super cheap and they begged me to stay here as the previous prospective tenant dropped out last minute. 

Another thing is that the entire village feels like it's stuck in the past I don’t think I’ve seen a single house that doesn’t look like it was built in the 14th century, there's no tescos or corner shop, shit the closest thing to a grocery store is this weird off-license just called “market”. It’s all just practically identical houses being taken over by the surrounding foliage. Maybe it’s because I grew up in a city my whole life but it’s just odd to me that there isn’t a single remotely new-looking place. Don’t get me wrong, it's kinda pleasant but not what I was expecting.

Oscar (1) bought some groceries and helped me unpack, which was nice of him. I think he feels bad for how involved he got with everything.

Anyway, that’s all I’ve got to report. I'm gonna unpack the last of my stuff and set up the PC tomorrow so I can hopefully get some work done.

**3rd of March 2019**

Got a terrible cold. My nose is running like a tap, I’ve got a killer headache and I can’t smell shit. I’ve been living off a diet of paracetamol, super noodles, and hot squash (2). Oscar Invited me over. I declined as I can’t do much other than sleep or respond to emails. My sleep schedule has also been completely fucked as for the last few nights there's this loud droning noise coming from outside so I’ve mostly been sleeping during the day.

I’ve been getting these [vouchers ](https://imgur.com/a/FeYd61h)from this place called Cafe Pech nonstop, they're so oddly written like they’ve been ran through Google Translate 80 times, maybe I’ll try them out if I get desperate.

Rewatched the E3 trailer for Cyber Punk, I’m so fucking hyped. It’s gonna be sick, cannot fucking wait, after Witcher 3 CD project red could shit on a plate and I’d eat it.

Speaking of eating, I’m running out of the food Oscar bought so I’ll need to pick up some groceries soon

Nothing else to report, pay day tomorrow tho.

**7th of March 2019**

Finally picked up some groceries from that market place yesterday, weirdly enough it is an actual grocery store. 

I only picked up a few bits I knew I could cook whilst still having this cold. Pot noodles and fish fingers I did buy some [chicken](https://imgur.com/a/24GhX3T) to make soup with but when I realized it was rancid, not expired just gross as fuck. I guess I didn’t smell it with my blocked nose. Just annoying. That noise that happens at night is a little quieter I guess.

Y’know what I’ve realized whilst I was driving, I haven’t seen a single person in the village, it’s empty. I haven’t seen a dog walker, a kid at the park, no one putting out their rubbish and I haven't even seen the postman. I just magically receive all my mail every morning alongside even more of those pech vouchers including Amazon stuff.

Maybe it’s because I haven’t been out of the house that much but it’s just eerie like everyone just left right as I arrived. My headache has cleared up a little bit so when I’m feeling a little less under the weather I’m gonna have a properly get to know the place.

**9th of March 2019**

I feel like absolute shit, I’ve been in bed for the entire day. Every symptom I have has somehow gotten worse. I’ve been getting zero sleep and the noise still hasn’t stopped. I might order from that pech place tonight as I can’t see myself making anything to eat, besides I'll be practically eating for free with all the vouchers I have.

**14th of March 2019** 

Forgot to write here for the last few days but I’ve honestly been feeling better and just getting stuff done. It probably helped that the noise has gotten a lot quiter.

That pech place was really good mostly just sandwiches and pastries but it filled a hole. What’s weird is I don’t remember giving them my address but I was probably too groggy to even remember. Honestly, everything from the 7th to the 9th few days was a blur. I only really remember sleeping a lot and eating from pech.

Probably gonna order from them again tonight. It was really good.

Haven’t seen anyone yet. I'm gonna try and introduce myself to my neighbors if I can find them.

**15th of March 2019**

I still haven’t seen anyone, it’s getting weird. I went next door to introduce myself today, but no one answered so I went to the next house and no one answered there either. I knocked on about 15 doors in total and NONE OF THEM ANSWERED. I’m confident that's not normal. I feel like I’m going insane. What's even stranger is that I looked through a few of the windows in one of the houses and from what I could see there were signs that people lived there or at least used to. The living room was furnished, there was a suitcase and even dirty dishes on the counter it kinda looked like they had just run off.

I’m seeing Oscar next week and I’m planning on telling him about the whole situation. Maybe he can make sense of this. I ate from Pech again and they didn’t even ask for the serial code this time they just took my order and then hung up.

**17th of march 2019**

Not seen anyone yet, and can't stop thinking about Pech. It's so good. Been getting a lot more sleep due the fact that the droning noise has stopped all together.

Decided to start clearing up the garden to get my mind off things. Mostly de-weeding, still annoying that the side of the house is locked which means I have to carry all rubbish bags filled with weeds through the house to the bins out front. I also noticed that there’s a lock on both sides of the back door meaning you can unlock on both sides. I guess it’s for the best that no one can get through the sides.

Think I’ll order Pech again.

**20th of March 2019**

Fuck. This. Shit. 

So I went on a walk last night to clear my head, work has been stressing me out and I needed to clear my head. I left a little before the sun was setting and just wandered the streets of the village. I got to the park, had a smoke, and then started walking back. To noneones surprise, I didn’t see anyone the entire time I was walking. 

But that's not what's messing with me. As I was walking home (about 500 meters from my house) all of the lights in all of the houses turned on for 2 seconds. Then they all just switched off like nothing happened. All except one, the one opposite me. It’s been a day and the entire time their lights have been on.

There are two things I didn’t notice when doing my rounds last night. Firstly the blinds are drawn which is insane as surely whoever used to live there or still does has something to hide and secondly it’s the only house that has astro turf. I know that sounds insignificant but for the only house in a village of near identical old cottages and bungalows to have something as modern as astroturf is insane to me.

I’m seeing Oscar on friday so I’m hoping he can help me with what I should do next.

1. Alice and Isaac had a shared friend group, most of which took Alice's side when they broke up aside from Oscar. I met him at the funeral and for the funeral, he was pretty friendly.
2. Squash is a British fruit drink that is often served either cold during the summer or boiling hot as a remedy for congestion.
