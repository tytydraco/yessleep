Hello, my name is Elijah and I am 18, when I finish this post and upload it online, I am most likely not around anymore. Or maybe I'm okay, I have no clue what they mean by, "fired." I've been working at my job in the fast food industry for three years now and I've seen a lot. 

From terrible customers and troublesome crew and all the standard customer service experiences. But nothing has ever been this strange or weird. I don't want to talk about myself much but I'm yet to enrol into college and I inspire to be a coder. I hope people don't forget about me. 

Anyways I was just home in my run-down apartment just chilling on my couch watching some Netflix. I can't particularly remember what show at the moment but that doesn't really matter.

I do remember how I was startled from the sudden buzzing of my phone. I was hoping when I lifted it up to my face my work number wouldn't appear. Of course it was them, they needed me to fill in for somebody. However this was majorly different from before. 

I was being offered double my pay. Now this sounds too good to be true. It wasn't time in a half, it wasn't some holiday, no, just a typical day, well, if a snowstorm counts as typical. So being the broke non-college student I am, I had to take the shift. 

Rent is due soon and I need any pocket money I can get. So I'm quick to press the off button for my TV and get all my work clothes. The shirt, the hat, just some basic black jeans, and the pin with my name. Since there is a storm I also made sure to put on boots and a jacket, and I carried my work shoes in some basic plastic bag.

At first I was pretty fine with working, it was only 6:30 to 10:30, 4 hours, nothing more, nothing less. Plus my friend Elliot was there, we started together and have been best friends ever since, I consider him to be best friend actually.

I unlocked my apartment door and instantly, a heavy snowfall came rushing in, like it was wanting shelter from this terrible cold as well. I walk out and close the door behind me making sure to lock it and I rush down my apartment stairs, I nearly tripped actually. 

My hands were feeling extremely cold already, and my car window needed some defrosting and also some time for the windshield wipers to actually clear everything off. 

To speed everything up I do a quick wipe with my right coat arm trying not to get any on my hand on the front side window. Then I move to the back to wipe off the rear side window a bit. After that I just unlock my car and swiftly enter to get away from everything going on outside. I can't believe I am going to work when the weather is like this, well, double pay was worht it at the time.

I remember thinking. I put my car keys into the ignition and started my car, putting my plastic bag onto the passenger seat as well. I set my AC to blast heat and turned the windshield wipers on.

My seat is getting wet since the snow is melting already. I wait a couple minutes before putting my seat belt on, backing up, and driving to work. 

Nothing of significance really did end up happening, just the constant pattering of snow on my window and how fast my view would've been covered, I'm lucky technology is so great.

In due time I make it to work, I turn off my car and remove the keys from the ignition, grab my bag, get out of my car, and just close the door, and I couldn't forget to lock it.

The snow already started slamming down onto me so I just ran inside and got to the break room quickly. I switched into my work shoes but kept my coat on and clocked in.

Apparently my job for today was just Drive-Thru and just that. 

Which was a boring one, but being honest I really looked at my phone a lot during Drive-Thru times. I've worked around this place for a while.

I could immediately tell if something different were to appear, just like someone who lived in a house for a long time could tell if something moved or if something was gone. 

That's when a saw it, under the trash can, it said FOR ###### ELIJAH. Being curious I picked up the paper and began reading.

I don't have the paper on me so I'm writing how I remember it. I wasn't allowed to bring it home. Also P.S there's so many scratched out words I recall, I think its just for my name.

Hello Elijah! We from the management team are glad you made it! Tonight is a special night, you we offered double pay yeah? Well you have to earn it! Follow these simple rules and you'll get through this shift easily.

Rule 1: Pay attention to the time! Strangely enough, the clock seems to stop or just seem off sometimes, please immediately call a MANAGER over to fix this issue. If you don't have this issue fixed within TEN MINUTES of this problem occurring. Strange things will happen if you don't fix it, and you will be immediately FIRED.

Rule 2: Under no circumstances are you to serve any customers driving black vans, trucks, and so on! To be more specific, between 7-8 is a period where the more. Tricky customers come out, you must ignore them even if they drive to your window, no exceptions. If you do answer one of these people you will be immediately FIRED.

Rule 3: If anyone comes to your window, not inside a car, look for anything wrong immediately. They may look normal, but we assure you, they aren't. However some of these people may just be normal so please talk to them. Just look out for anything that seems off when someone knocks. If you answer one of these people you will be immediately FIRED.

Rule 4: Don't leave the Drive-Thru window open or ajar. I need not explain, you are inviting them in. You will be immediately FIRED.

Rule 5: Please look out for Geoff. Geoff doesn't work here, sometimes he stops by after a CREW MEMBER makes a mistake with a specific rule. Please inform a MANAGER if you spot him. He has orange hair, freckles, glasses, and lots of ring jewellery, specifically silver and gold. If you spot Geoff but don't call it in you will be immediately FIRED.

Rule 6: Never leave change on the floor if any are dropped. Some may take that as payment and would like more, we hate losing money, so if you do, you'll be immediately FIRED.

Rule 7: Do not leave your station unless a MANAGER told you so. Sometimes, a CREW MEMBER may attempt to get you to leave your station, and may say the MANAGER told you two to switch. This is a lie, don't leave your station. If you do you'll be immediately FIRED.

Rule 8: Lastly, never tell friends, family, or anyone about this list. If you do, you'll be immediately FIRED.

We wish you luck Elijah! If you'd like more hours just call a MANAGER and ask for them. We are working past closing hours tonight. Thank you for your great effort and amazing work!

I finished reading and immediately thought about how dumb of a joke it was. But then a loud thud from the window scared me, I definitely was startled. A man standing outside with a coat and, oddly enough, wearing shorts. He was saying stuff about wanting to order and can he order.

My hand reached for the handle when it froze. I nearly forgot about Rule 3, this man was weird, it's a snow storm out there and he is wearing shorts? 

I recall thinking something like, "Wait, is this Rule stuff real then?" Eventually, after tons of banging and desperate scratches at the window, I could tell something wasn't normal about the guy.

Eventually, he moved onto the next window to barrage another crew member, a girl. I won't tell her name, so I'll just say Alice, well she ignored him too, this is like the only time I will mention her, she isnt important.

So are we getting the same rules? Why can't we talk about it? And why get fired for not following some dumb rules. I sigh then look at the time, 10:30? My shift is over? No, impossible.

I'm lucky I immediately called a manager over and yeah, the time was wrong. What's with this stuff? I'm not covering the boring business, it was snowing and I was working at Drive-Thru.

For most of the time I was just reporting the weird times and checking my phone like usual when a sudden rush at 8:00 PM appeared.

There were plenty of white cars appearing, only white actually. They weren't white from the snow though of course.

I nearly forgotten about the second rule when a black car appeared, it wasn't a hard rule, just ignore them, they'll either stop at the windows, or drive off immediately.

It wasn't much of an issue, it was just like the people. Until later in the night when the people, not the cars, became harder to spot. Some of them looked alright, and I actually had to stand up tall just to notice how their shoes are either weird or not suited for the weather.

I swear, sometimes I just got paranoid and didn't answer for real people, but hopefully there wasn't an issue for that I hope. I was chilling when my friend Elliot walked up to my station, never entering though. 

"Yoo! Elliot whats up my man!" I immediately spoke out to him. Elliot smiled and spoke back. "Mann I'm doing terrible, so damn coldâ€¦ Ay I'm just here to switch with you." Elliot responded somewhat casually I think. Yet, I didn't budge. 

Those rules don't leave my mind, I can't switch with a crew member, even though I know him, I didn't move, I couldn't move. A statue just stuck in the same position. "Oh c'mon mannn, we can switch, we are cool! Best bros! Just step out." 

No. I didn't speak to Elliot, he's trying to get me to break the rules!? I want this job- no, no I need this job. I remember thinking that, I don't quite believe this job actually is for me anymore though.

I outright ignored Elliot, and when my shift ended I went home just like that. That weird night was over, and a month has passed since then.

I called work and asked about Elliot, he was fired, apparently earlier into his shift for trash talking crew members. That isn't possible though, Elliot would definitely not do that. But I'm sure I also saw him, he wanted me to leave my station. I check through my texts with him, me and him usually discuss our shifts and duties and, well, I'll just put our messages here.

2:55 PM XX/XX/XX
Elliot> Yoo, working today? Anyway between 3 to 9?
Nah, I'm free for there today haha, unlucky <Me
Elliot> I think you mean lucky me!! Drive-Thru duty today ðŸ˜Ž
Gah damn!! ðŸ‘€ It's a snow storm though, bring a coat bud <Me
Elliot> Ofc, see ya later man!

I don't want to push onwards but it made sense to me, that out of the blue call to work, the scratched words and also justâ€¦ Him being fired, he broke a rule, was he fired? 

I've texted and called and Elliot is now confirmed missing. I haven't gone to work now. So here I am. My rent is due soon, I don't have enough money for it, so I'm typing this all for you now.

I don't know what will happen to me, most likely whatever happened to my friend, gone and missing. Please don't forget me, don't forget my friend either.

I wonder what awaits? Death? Who would've thought working at some fast food place was this crazy. I already hear knocks at my door, they know, they are here for me.
