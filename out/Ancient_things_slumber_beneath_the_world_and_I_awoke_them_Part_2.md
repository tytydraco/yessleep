They came in four huge, covered trucks, accompanying the logistics vehicles with our equipment. They brought radar dishes, surface-to-air missiles, and quickly established a perimeter around the mine, where they patrolled day and night. Their officers told us that the dig was out of the hands of the universities, that this was now being overseen directly by the government.

It was an awesome display of power, especially once they set up their helicopter pads and high-ranking officials started coming and going by air. The soldiers looked very foreign with their domestic rifles and camouflage, and they never really spoke to us, but they didn’t seem unfriendly. Like soldiers the world over, they found glorified guard duty boring.

And the dig never stopped. Despite the sudden and alarming military intervention, they seemed content to let us continue without change. Xhen-Wi was still in charge, and though he and Popov were often seen speaking furiously in hushed conversations with the Chinese government suits, nothing seemed to come of it.

This afternoon, after we had failed once again to free a single terrific figure from its pit of night and stone, the military would send their own demolitions experts into the hole to rig up the new explosives. From what I could tell, those men, suiting up and standing ready by some sort of tracked transport, had no idea what awaited them below.

We archaeologists, minus Matthews who was ill, watched as the vehicle begin its descent down the benches. It reminded me of nothing so much as a mechanical beetle crawling around the dusty spiral, moving ever downwards.  We were all silent, made sullen by our long and fruitless efforts whilst hypnotised in the hole, working in a harrowing unison without though.

Perhaps we were all mad, I reflected, as the APC continued down the slope. It was only a short time before it disappeared beneath the artificial horizon. The military officers stood at a makeshift desk, covered in radio and communication equipment. Though I spoke no Mandarin, it was obviously they were making regular check-ins with the demolition team’s progress.

Xhen-Wi passed me one of his cigarettes, and we smoked together.

After twenty minutes, the team checked in, sounding normal, and clearly still moving down. The bass of the engine came through the speakers distorted and tinny, yet recognisable.

Koslova and I exchanged some small talk.

The next check and the demolitions team sounded nervous, engine still running, but there was trepidation in those foreign voices, and I knew they’d reached that unnatural night that lies at the bottom of the pit. But, the officers shouted, and the team must have kept moving.

Another of the Chinese archaeologists was handing out cold drinks, so I grabbed a beer and another cigarette.

The radio sounded as distorted as ever, but the vehicle was silent, and there was a stream of panicked and shouted Mandarin from the bottom of the pit. The officers at the radio were on their feet in an instant, shouting into the transceiver, gesticulating wildly to higher-ranked military and government personnel.

I merely kept drinking my beer as the chaos unfolded. Popov and Koslova watched on as well, and the Chinese archaeologists stood separate, shaking their heads and talking to each other.

Soon, the officers on the radio calmed down, being that they were now met with nothing but silence, save an indiscernible shuffling from the other side.

Another twenty minutes passed, and Popov stormed off, apparently to go and work on the recovered tablets. Xhen-Wi talked with me a while, and Koslova stood, looking concerned, as more men in both uniforms and suits crowed around the silent speakers.

Xhen-Wi moved closer, right up beside me.

“Dr Matthews is very ill.”

I nodded. Even now, my own guts were occasionally writhing, churning with pain. And Matthews had been here weeks before me.

The radio jumped back to life. The officers and officials gathered around, horror etched on their faces.

Laughing. The demolition team, who must have been in the bottom of the pit for ages, were laughing and cackling through the distorted speakers. An unhinged, high-pitched laugh, one reserved only for the deeply insane.

In an instant, those laughs turned to screams, and there came voices once more, in Chinese that I frustratingly could not understand, angry and tense and full of argument. The officers by the radio were shouting orders fruitlessly. Then came the report of automatic gunfire. This we heard not only through the radio, but a half second later, echoing up from the pit itself.

What followed were screams, and a slowing of the fire fight.

Then the explosives went off. How much they had planned to use I know not, yet in that instant those poor souls, mad in the pit, had set off everything they’d taken.

The ground shook, and a wall of dust burst forth from the mine, the shockwave nearly throwing me off my feet as the sound of the explosion battered my ears.

In the confusion, I’d grabbed Xhen-Wi as he’d tripped. The military and government men were arguing, utterly headless as they shifted the blame around.

Xhen-Wi was trying to talk to me, but I was deafened by the blast, I could only shake my head.

The confusion took another two hours to sort out. In that time, I’d gone to my quarters, thinking to stop in and check on Matthews.

As I entered through the flimsy plastic door, my nose was assaulted by the smell. It was a rancid, decaying, metallic reek that was far too familiar now. Fearing the worst, I stepped through towards his door.

“Matthews?” I called, gently.

His door stood ajar, yet lifeless.

As I went to push open the door, I saw him.

He was hunched on the toilet, nude save for his hat. His clothes were scattered and torn on the path he must have hurriedly taken. His body, for he was certainly dead, was sickening. His belly was blackened and engorged and distended, hanging like a half filled sack, with a violent rent in the front.

Stepping even closer, I could see clean through his insides. A hole had been ripped through him, from his stomach at the front, all the way down and out through his colon. And all inside was a festering, reeking blackness.

I do not know how long I stood and looked at my old friend. It was evening, however, by the time an ambulance had fetched his body. Haemorrhaging of the bowels, they said. I cried for Dr Matthews that night. Not only did I feel the loss of one of the great archaeologists of our time, more than that, I felt the loss of my friend. My only friend here.

I was now alone, lost in a foreign country, with an aching, crawling sensation in my guts, and a longing to cast myself into that dark abyss that lays just a few hundred meters from me.

 

………

 

I dreamt.

Once more, my twisted black limbs reached out. Not, as I had thought before, for a pool of bright water, but for light.

I was reaching up from a pit, towards a blue sunlit sky like I had never before seen.

 

I awoke in agony.

I could feel it this time, as I dragged myself towards the bathroom. Something was twisted and crawling in my bowels, they moved, like coiled rope they pressed and twisted against my flesh, and I could feel them with my hands, rising and writhing beneath my skin.

I barely made it before my body evacuated such reeking black slime as I’ve never seen. It smelt of iron and copper and raw ethanol. It burned on the way out, leaving flesh raw and bloody.

It took me nearly an hour to gather myself. Upon stepping into the harsh sun, I found what was left of our little band strung out around the tables where we ate our dinners.

To a man, they looked haunted, gaunt. Drained. Xhen-Wi separated us into two groups, those that would go to the site, and those that would stay with the tablets. Today, it was Koslova, Popov, and myself. The others would all go down without us.

I felt concern then. Koslova seemed a reasonably friendly young woman, but Popov had shown nothing but distaste for me. Yet, a glance at the aged man showed a look of acceptance on his face, followed by a curt nod.

No one had been down the mine since yesterday’s disastrous military intervention. The military and government men seemed content once more to allow us to continue under their supervision. This time, the team going down carried radios, and both the military had one, as did I and Popov.

With no great fanfare, the remaining Chinese archaeologists turned to their trucks, silently resigned to once more enter that maddening hole in the earth, and see what horrors the explosives had uncovered. They walked like men condemned.

Popov and Koslova took me to their own rooms, set up to research the tablets. Upon entering, there were several of them, oblongs of identical size, bare and black, and coated with some inhuman script. It was hot. Unbearably so, so before we began I went and opened one of the cheap, flimsy windows.

Koslova shut and locked the door behind me. For an instant, I felt an edge of fear, but then Popov turned to me, looking resigned.

“Have a look.” He said in perfect English.

Startled, I could do nothing but advance on the tablets. As with the statue below, the text was barely visible on the light-absorbing surface, and yet they were clearly like no script I’d ever seen.

“I cannot fathom it. I’ve studied virtually all the oldest scripts even known to be written. This is like nothing else… it’s…”

“Inhuman?” Popov asked.

“I would say so.”

The old man nodded. “There are few who have ever seen this script, fewer still who are alive.”

“What do you mean?” Once more I felt threatened, looking from the inscrutable Popov to the concerned Koslova.

Yet neither made any sudden or violent motions. Instead, Popov merely came up beside me, holding a very battered notebook.

He spoke. “Have you heard of Sukhoy Nos?”

“No. Should I have?”

He shrugged. “It was before your time. We hid it well. Sukhoy Nos is on an island, Severny. It is in the far north, nearly the Artic.”

“What does this have to do with anything?”

Popov slapped the book down, hard, on the counter, and I couldn’t help but jump.

“Listen, boy. There are secrets here. Very old ones.”

He turned to Koslova, rattled off something in Russian. The woman nodded, face grim, and stepped outside the door.

“She will watch, make sure no one is listening.”

“Why?” I asked.

“Are you dense? I am about to reveal to you secrets that are sixty years old. I would be killed if any were to learn of this. But I am dying, and the world must know.” He pointed at my belly, painful as it was. “You are dying too. But there is a chance for you to get the word out.”

He flipped open the notebook, and on its yellowed pages I saw illustrations of the shovel-headed beings with too many eyes and impossible limbs, just like the statues we found below.

“We found them. In the nineteen-fifties. Deep in Sukhoy Nos. More than a mile down. It was a mine, at first. We have hidden that. History was so easy to hide in the Soviet Union.” His voiced purred with nostalgia.

He flicked through the notes, showing similar tablets, copies of the symbols, and what in Russian must have been a translation.

His hands shook feverishly.

“It drove them mad, the archaeologists who dug in that place. The soldiers that provided the physical labour, the prisoners who dug in the pit. All of them went mad. Many died, but not before being ripped apart from within.” He looked at me, eyes aglow with fervour. “We had to destroy them. Not only the statues, the tablets, but the men.”

I looked back over the black relics that sat like butcher’s blocks on the tables.

“We dropped many bombs over Sukhoy Nos. For three years, as many nuclear weapons as we could without the American’s growing too suspicious, without them sending their spy planes.”

He grabbed my arm.

“In sixty-one, we dropped the greatest weapon ever made, the Tsar Bomb, codename Ivan. We called it a test, but in truth it was a desperate, final attempt to save the whole world from the terrors we found.”

I was shaken, rooted to the spot, barely able to breathe.

“Why? What is written on those tablets?”

Popov dragged me round, holding me by the shoulders. He looked me in the eyes and I smelt his rancid breath.

“It says *Cairn of the Sleepers. The rest of the Ancient Ones, once disturbed, they shall again walk the Earth, under the sunless night, and the Earth shall once again know the dread of the blasphemous.*”

The words meant little to me, but the sense of dread emanating from the old man was palpable.

Suddenly, he doubled over, groaning, and other, fouler noises came from his body. I shouted for Koslova, but she must not have been able to hear me.

Popov ripped at his shirt, and I saw, sickeningly, his belly bulging with something gestating and struggling beneath his flesh. He shouting in Russian, and made a noise somewhere between a whimper and a scream as the pulsating, writhing mass pushed at his flesh, distending and engorging his stomach.

I could do nothing but hold his hand and shout for help as he soiled himself, a metallic, reeking black ooze seeping through his trousers and across the floor. I ignored the smell as the man rolled and strained in his own filth, screaming fully now.

As the man’s pain reached its zenith, his belly bulged and then split. Entrails and blood and blackness flooded out from him, warm and stinking, steaming my face, and soaking my legs where I crouched. From within his ruined guts, some unholy creature, product of this blasphemous pregnancy, came crawling.

Black and shining and coated in ichor, the shovel-headed spawn crawled free of Popov’s entrails as he shuddered and at last died. The thing pushed itself along, multiple spindly, narrow arms and legs with too many joints.

It could not stand, small as it was, but it looked at me with sixteen sets of eyes, and then it turned and fled, leaping through the window I had opened.

Koslova returned after a few minutes. She shrieked, and it took us longer to sort out this death than with Matthews. Soon though, Popov was gone, and I stayed silent about the things I had seen, about what Popov told me. I had no idea how to get anyone to believe me; a sole English archaeologist, out of his depth and suffering the same churning pains that had now killed three members of the expedition.

In the following hours, Koslova and I tried to get the government officials or the officers to listen to us. We tried to explain the tablets, the infection in all of us who ventured into the hole, about the impossible and dark things waiting to be reborn into the world.

Either they didn’t understand us, or more likely they didn’t trust us.

Xhen-Wi and the others never returned to the surface. Communications had been lost as soon as they reached the bottom of the pit. What they found, what they encountered, I cannot guess at. But I hope they died quickly.

The Chinese have banned any more ventures down into the mine until they have more orders. Koslova and I have been pushed aside, but the pain in my guts is now crippling. I am dying, of that I’m certain.

For a few days we were seemingly forgotten, left to our own devices.

Then, we were put into custody.

They checked us into some local hospital, our rooms watched as we are devoured from the inside. It is there I am writing this.

I found something, buried beneath the earth. Something older than humanity. Older than God. I hope that someone reads this, someone who can stop the return of those ancient terrors.
