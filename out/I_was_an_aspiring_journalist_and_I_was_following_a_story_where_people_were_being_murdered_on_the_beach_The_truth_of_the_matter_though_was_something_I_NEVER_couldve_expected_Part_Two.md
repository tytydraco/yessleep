When we got back to *SunnyShore,* I was dropped off, being left with a warning. "Word to the wise, next time, just remember that sharks tend to feed at night here, that's all, got it?" I didn't reply, nor did they wait for one before speeding off. Immediately, I scurried back to my condo. It was about 3:00 or so by that point. Still enough time to try and figure out what I was gonna do next.

I will say one thing. Those cops might've been desperate and wildly extreme in their approach, but thank God they were so desperate that they never thought to take my phone. Not only that, but thank God I was forward thinking enough to go ahead and send the pictures they confiscated to Nolan. At least now, I'm not *completely* starting from scratch. *Nolan Peters, the human thumb drive.*

But regardless, that still begged the other question, how was I supposed to proceed going forward? I found when I came back in the room, to both my dismay and utter chagrin, that during her little rampage through my suite, Mrs. Trigger Happy went and also smashed the absolute shit out of my $400 Laptop. *Thanks, bitch.*

Not only that, but without the camera, the best quality I'd have been able to get was whatever my Nokia from back in like, 2013, could manage. Not exactly ideal for someone like me who was trying to make a foothold with an up and coming journalism outlet. Especially not if I was trying to be taken seriously. It was bad enough they were going to the extremes they were just to shut me up.

Of course, then, what exactly *were* my options then? To simply give up, say "Fuck this place" and go back home? They'd win. Whoever and why they're doing it, they'd win, suppressing the truth -- whatever it may be -- and those that died, they'd get thrown under the rug as a bunch of unlucky nobodies who were swept under the rug, effectively forgotten about.

No, I'd find a way to keep going with this. Either that, or I'd *make* a way. The first thing I did was to try calling Nolan to tell him what was going on. And because I have a feeling I know what you're about to say, yes, I'm well fucking aware they could've been tapping the phones, but I needed *someone* to know, even if it wasn't the public as a whole, should I go missing or whatever.

As it happened, it was straight to voicemail, all three times. I ended up leaving him a message.

*"Hey man, It's me, Max. Listen um, I need you to make sure those pictures I sent you don't go anywhere. Shit's gotten fucky around here and I don't know what it is, but I know for a fact they don't want the public to know about it. So yeah, just... If anything happens, anything takes a jog sideways, I need you to make sure that stuff makes it into the hands of "World of Weird", okay man? Thanks."*

After that, I decided to make a little bit of food before trying to go back out on the beach. A, because I was starving -- I guess being arrested and harassed can work up that kind of appetite, huh? And B, because I figured, having only *just* gotten let go for poking around too much, it'd be wise to lay low *at least* for another couple of hours before trying to go out and start snapping away. It was about 5:00 when I decided to head back out again.

Another detail that occurred to me as well, thinking back to the other cases as well as the one from earlier, whatever was happening to these folks, it was happening overnight. That would mean, if I *were* to catch anything interesting, it was most likely to be at nighttime. *I just hope the flash on this piece of junk works.*

So back out on the beach, I went. Like the previous night, there was next to absolutely nobody around on the beach. I started walking along the surf, constantly looking back and forth over my shoulder to see if either Mrs. Trigger happy or her C.O. were keeping eyes on me. The sun was quickly sinking below the horizon again. I decided to pay attention to the tide itself.

If it was something from the water, I thought I might have the best chance of spotting it by paying close attention to it. Of course, *what* exactly it was I was supposed to be looking for, I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be looking for a person, the dorsal fin of a shark, *what*. Then, from the distance across the horizon, I began to hear it. It was strange at first, sounding like a mix between some sort of distant drum beat and the sound a humpback whale makes when it's doing a mating call, deep and echoing. I took out my phone and did my best to zoom in on where I thought the sound was coming from.

I couldn't see anything at first, just the current rush of the night tide. Even maxing the zoom didn't help. There was nothing there.

I looked around to see if any of the other ten or twelve other people that happened to actually be on the beach could hear it, too. Sure enough, I wasn't the only one who could hear it, though apparently, I *was* the only one brave enough to stay where I was. Just about all of them scrambled over each other, desperately trying to get away from the ocean. *What the hell, what's going on, why's everyone running?*

I looked back toward the ocean. I still couldn't see anything coming out of the water, however, I did spot a sea of foam seeming to come from the area where the whale-ish sounds were coming from. The foam traveled on a direct path toward the shoreline. I snapped a picture of it and instantly texted it to Nolan. Even if it was nothing, it was evidently enough to scare the absolute hell out of these people, I could at least use that in whatever piece I'd be able to scrape up with this project, right?

About halfway to the shoreline, though, I actually saw something emerge from the water. A fin. An *actual fucking fin!*

Mind you, though, it wasn't the dorsal fin of a shark. No, this one was sort of webbed, the kind you'd find on trout or tuna. Actual saltwater fish, despite the fact that, at least last I checked, neither of those were known for their ability to devour people like what was going on here. I squinted to try and get a closer look.

*The hell is that?* I wondered, seeing the fun draw closer and closer. Whatever it was was moving fast. It didn’t take but the lesser half of two minutes before the thing had made it almost right up on the shoreline, almost right on fucking top of me from all the way out in the middle of the ocean.

I actually stumbled trying to backpedal away from it. It kept coming. Soon, I finally saw more of the thing break the surface of the water. That’s when I damn near had a heart attack.

There, along the shoreline, standing around 6 1/2 to 7 fuckin’ feet tall only about 3 feet away from me, was... was a...

Fuck, it hurts to try imagining that thing again. Basically, think the Gill man, but if he was juicing every two hours before pumping mad iron. Oh, and *then* add these weird tentacle things that were coming out of his fucking back, covered in what looked like thorns, giving them an appearance similar to barbed wire, and well...

*In the words of Bill Paxton, “Game over, man! GAME OVER!”*

Laid on my back in the sand, I couldn’t move. I was frozen, every muscle in my body feeling like they’d been blasted with ice. “Creature from *SunnyShore Resort*” took two lumbering steps toward me. I kid you not, either, when I tell you I could feel the ground tremble in fear beneath me with those two steps.

*BOOM, BOOM*

The creature took two more steps toward me. Its marbled, globulous eyes beat down on me, bulging and twitching erratically. The creature’s breathing was heavy, almost snarling — if fish can snarl.

*BOOM, BOOM*

Two rumbling steps more, driving the earth around me further and further toward an earthquake. My heart was skipping about five beats with each quaking step. And taking such huge strides like it was, the creature was soon looming over me. It looked straight down at me, a grizzly looking down upon a wounded deer. Or rather, a shark staring down at a guppie with his mouth caught on a big ass hook.

It wasn’t until I heard this sort of screeching sound that sounded like ten nails being dragged across a blackboard while underwater coming from behind me that I even found it in me to turn the fuck around. Behind me were two hooded figures holding torches. Their hands were raised in the air, waving their torches, almost in a sort of defensive manor at the creature.

The creature responded with a roar of its own that I swear to fucking *GOD* caused an *actual* earthquake. I didn’t know what the fuck air was supposed to do. And before you decide to be a wise ass and say *”RUN FOREST, RUN!”* keep in mind, I was essentially cut off. Even *if* I could’ve made myself move, there was no telling how quickly the behemoth fish man thing would’ve snatched me right back up and planted my ass right back in the ground.

Nevermind of course the druids standing behind me. They continued waving their torches at it, screeching. This went on back and forth between them for the better part of a minute before I watched them step closer to us. The creature did not move. One of its twitching eyes remained fixed on me while the other was deadlocked on the druids like a friggin’ chameleon.

Then, from further off in the distance behind the druids, I heard another, slightly deeper screeching sound accompanied by what sounded like a woman screaming. “NO!” I heard her cry, “LET ME GO!”

Looking closer, I saw another figure, this one taller than the two figures behind me and, at least at first glance, appeared to be wearing a weird fish mask that looked similar to the creature’s. He had one hand raised in the air, with the other firmly grasping the struggling woman. I heard him cry out again, to which the creature responded with another earth shaking roar of its own.

The masked figure approached the two hooded ones, dragging the woman behind almost effortlessly, despite seemingly fighting for dear life. My heart sped up when I saw who the would-be victim was. It was the receptionist, “Tired Tracy”!

*Holy mother of... they aren’t about to...*

She screamed out again for her captor to let go. He paid her no attention, though, drowning out her screaming with his own screeches. “Tired Tracy” tried scratching at the man’s face, only to have her arm twisted, causing her to cry out in pain.

I was confused, frightened, dumbfounded frankly, as well as just straight up fucking panicking. I was at a complete loss for what I was supposed to do. I knew I couldn’t just sit there and watch as they would just up and feed her to this thing like it looked like they were about to. I didn’t like the chick, sure, but I didn’t want to see her become live bait, either.

But then, what the hell was *I* supposed to do? Even *if* this thing wasn’t built like if the Incredible Hulk had a baby with the Ursula from *The Little Mermaid*, it was still four against one and, pathetic as this might sound being a dude, I’m no kind of fighter. I didn’t have any weapons with me, either. Just my phone and the clothes on my back.

*Phone...*

That’s when I looked up and realized that the creature’s left eye was no longer watching me. Now, its attention was fixed solely upon its impending supper. I took out my phone then, making sure the flash was on, given that the sun had just about disappeared entirely, and snapped photos of the scene around me.

I basically started snapping away, not at all trying to focus on anything in particular. This was done for two reasons. First, obviously, for proof that what I was seeing here wasn’t some sort of pipe dream or hallucination or something like that. The second, though, was to hopefully divert their focus away from “Tired Tracy” enough for her to possibly break free and run.

Well, sure enough, this actually sorta worked, though it proved just how little I’d actually thought this plan out. I’d taken about fifteen or twenty pictures with my phone before I realized they were all now staring at me; Fish Hulk, the masked man, and the two druids, all of them, now glaring right at me. With this, their collective distraction, “Tired Tracy” wrenched her wrist free of the masked man’s grip and took off back toward the suite building.

She was free, but now I was screwed. The four of them now had their sights set on me and I could tell they were fuckin’ *pissed*! I wasn’t entirely clear on what the heck was going on, but I wasn’t an idiot. This was apparently some human sacrifice ceremony, and I’d just gotten myself knee-deep in it where I evidently didn’t belong.

I looked around. Everywhere around me, I was cut off except for directly behind me. Thinking quickly, I chucked my phone at the masked man (what else was I supposed to use — again, no weapon) before turning and booking it in the opposite direction. I couldn’t hear them, but I wasn’t gonna *dare* risk turning to look behind me.

I had to have been gunning it at least 50 miles per hour — at least how it felt anyway. I didn’t know where authors was heading, either. I couldn’t think about that. Hell, I could barely even *think* at all, aside from *“Oh please God, don’t let these fucking things catch me!”*

Sure enough, God was actually listening because after about maybe a further 5-10 minutes (for a total of close to 20 minutes straight) of running blindly, exhausting myself to the point where I was ready to collapse face first in the sand, I looked back to see the coast appeared to be clear. The hadn’t chased after me. I had just enough breath in me to allow myself a laugh of relief before I did end up falling to my side on the beach.

The adrenaline wore off almost as quickly as it came. In only 5 seconds after collapsing, my ass was out like a busted light. It was morning before I woke up again. It was two of the stoner kids from before. “Dude...Like are you still alive?” One of them asked, looking like he’d just seen the face of God and was about to have the secrets of the universe told to him.

“Huh... what the fuck? What happened?”

“You were wiped the fuck out, my dude!” Another kid squealed excitedly. I looked around. Everything looked so fuzzy, clouded.

“Where am I?” I asked.

“On the boardwalk.” The first one replied again.

“Bro, I think the man wigged out a little too hard last night!” The other exclaimed. He pulled the joint he was puffing on from behind his ear and extended it to me. “Here, dude, take a puff, help you loosen up.” I looked at him groggily.

I won’t lie, I was stuck between wanting to put my foot in all three of their asses just out of sheer annoyance, and actually saying “fuck it” and taking the joint. About a minute later, I ended up doing neither of those things and instead stood up and started trying to stumble my way back to where I thought I remembered running from the previous night.

Whether because of how exhausted I was, or because of the utterly bizarre nature of what happened that night, my mind was in a bit of a weird haze. I couldn’t remember much of anything outside of these small fragments of seeing fish people. Eventually, though, I actually managed to find my phone laying buried in the sand, right next to a big ass footprint that no one was gonna mistake as being a person’s.

That’s when everything came flooding back to me and I swiped my phone up from the sand. I tried dusting it off and turning it on, only to find that both the battery was dead and the SIM card had been removed. *FUCK!*

That was it. I was screwed, essentially. Even getting the phone turned back on, I’d still lose all of the pictures from that night. I had the ones that’d been sent to Nolan, sure, but no one was gonna take *that* seriously. “Just another shark attack”, that’d be what they called it. Yeah, okay, it’d be *A STORY*, and yeah, I’d make a bit of cash from it, but that’s NOT what the fuck happened here!

I knew it, “Tired Tracy” sure as hell knew it, and I was willing to bet every Penny to my name the police knew about it as well. That then became my next move: find “Tired Tracy” and figure out what they were doing with her on the beach that night. I took a glance down at the footprint and back to the morning tide. I knew it wouldn’t be long before that’d be washed away. *Goddamn it, what I wouldn’t give to have my camera again...*
