It's been a month, and we've settled in at my mother's place well. Since we arrived, my mother has been doting on Luke nonstop, playing with him and buying him new baby clothes. I have told her he’s barely a month old and probably doesn't even realise what's happening around him, but i think she's just excited to be a grandmother. Not like Shed has a good chance with my brother or sister. Speaking of the latter, she stayed in her room while we were there. Helen spends most of her time at her girlfriend's place these days, so Iris and I aren't intruding on her space by living here. We see her occasionally when she pops back home to grab some fresh clothes or to have dinner with the family. 

Most importantly, there's no sight of that bird. I dont know if it's because we're in the city and there's no place for it to hide, or if it's because my mother's home is on the fifth floor of an apartment complex. I hate to think that it's the opposite, though, that it's somewhere here, and I've just not been able to spot it. I do try to push the thought from my mind, and I have found a few ways to distract myself. I've been hanging out with my brother a lot; he's the only one who I've told about what happened. I say told, more like my brother a Redditor and found my last story, and since then has been asking a lot of questions. Stuff like “Are you on drugs?” or “What kind of bird was it?”. 

Through his questioning, he figured out that the bird I was looking at was a peacock. A female one, to be specific, I only didn't recognise it as one because I didn't know only male peacocks have bright-coloured feathers. Anyway, all of this to say, we were settling into something normal. I even started to feel comfortable taking Luke out in his stroller, God knows my mom likes to do it. I still tried to keep him indoors whenever I could, just to be safe, but sometimes we had to take him out with us. Like what happened recently. 

It was a few days ago. My mom was working at the family restaurant, and my brother was busy. He wouldn't tell me what with specifically; all I knew was it was something to do with Hunting. I think he also mentioned some girl he was hanging out with named Luna. Since we had no one to babysit while Iris and I went shopping, we took Luke with us, put him in the new stroller my mom got for him, and set off. 

I couldn't help but feel a looming sense of unease, looking around every corner and street as we walked to the mall. The trip, however, was uneventful, aside from stopping a few times because some old ladies were aweing at the baby along with me and Iris talking about moving closer to my mom. As far as she's aware, im still shaken up from the \`break in\`.  Eventually, she did ask. “Is everything ok Lex (my name is Alex). Like, overall, I know getting attacked is messing with you, but you can talk to me” 

“Im alright, I just feel on edge. Like I can't shake the feeling something is wrong.”

Iris seemed to hold on to that for a second before responding.

“Nothing is wrong, but I understand why you'd feel that way. I would be the same way in your shoes.”

“It… it's not just what happened, it feels like something else, like im being watched.” 

A suspicion I feel, given past and current events, is well warranted. Iris, however, seemed to brush it off as paranoia, and I dont personally blame her. Once we entered the mall, we made our way around, picking out some essentials for my mom while also grabbing a few things for Luke. There was also a hair salon in the mall that my mom recommended to Iris, which she went to before we left. 

I sat there with the grocery bags on the seat beside me and Luke fast asleep in his stroller. I was gently rocking it back and forth, trying to keep him asleep despite the busy salon and also to keep myself focused on a task and my mind off my paranoia. My attention was snapped away by the door opening, distracting me for a moment as I then found myself staring out the large glass window. For some reason, one woman in the crowd caught my attention. She was standing still in the centre of the food court, barely a twitch or sway. She seemed off, though at the time, I couldn't pin down why due to the distance. 

She was wearing some sort of robe or dress, blue silk, glistening slightly, her eyes wide with a stare that’d make someone with shell shock look like they were squinting. I watched her for a moment, noticing as people made attempts to avoid her without even acknowledging her, along with the fact that she was staring directly at me. Even through the crowds of people repeatedly passing by and blocking her view, she remained fixed on my position. Part of me was hoping she was some junkie… A junkie in fine silks… because that made sense at the time. 

“She's got a staring problem, ain't she?”

The voice spooked me for a moment as I looked back, seeing an elderly black gentleman behind me. He was probably there waiting for his wife since I saw him come in with a woman earlier. 

“Yeah… Do you think she's looking at me?” I asked with some hesitation. 

“Hell if I know. If I had to guess, I'd say drugs”“I was thinking the same thing… but her clothes are too nice” 

He’d nod silently at my point. 

“I think it best to keep our distance on the way out… you never know what those people are like” 

I agree with him, though I would have said it a bit less judgmentally. Before the conversation could go any further, and before I could dwell on the woman staring at me any longer, Iris walked over. She was ready to leave, and I wasn't all too eager to stay. I gave the Old Man a quick goodbye as Iris, Luke, and I left through the back end of the mall. I did peer back. The woman's gaze was following us. 

Once we left the Mall, we headed straight home. I was focused on just getting there, on getting my wife and son to safety. After we had been walking for what felt like forever, even though we were barely a few blocks away from the mall, Iris tugged on my shirt to get my attention. 

“I dont want to make your paranoia worse, but that lady’s been following us for a few blocks now” 

Shed told me, her voice filled with concern as she edged closer to me. 

“I know. She was staring at me in the Mall as well” 

“She doesn't look ok” 

“Let's just try to shake her. She’s not going very fast, so it shouldn't be too hard” 

Iris took a deep breath before nodding. We then spent the next 15 minutes going down different routes, across streets, even going in circles a few times, and each time we looked back, she was still there. Never too close, always just far enough as to where we can barely make out specific details. She never really sped up either, or at least when we looked back, she always seemed to be walking slower than we were. Eventually, and to our luck, we turned back and she was gone. We stayed off-path for a little while longer. She was still gone. Once we were sure she was not following us anymore, we went back to my mom's place. I kept a close eye on the windows the rest of the day after that. 

And that brings us to today. My mom wanted to have a family dinner since I was staying with her, my sister's girlfriend was out of town, and Archie had returned from his hunting trip. She figured it'd be perfect given the whole family was free. I wasn't opposed; God knows I needed the distraction. Even my father joined us. It wasn't a surprise; even after the divorce, he and my mom were still on good terms. Most of the family sat around the dinner table, aside from Helen, who was sitting over on the couch keeping Luke company while Iris and I were talking with my mom and dad about embarrassing childhood memories. 

Archie was occasionally chipping in with things he remembered while slipping bits of food to Concrete (yes, that's his dog's name). He went over to the kitchen in the middle of a story about our parents catching him smoking weed. After a few minutes, he came back in and leaned into my ear to whisper. 

“Can I talk to you in the kitchen for a moment?” 

“Uhm, yeah. Excuse me”

We head into the kitchen, my brother closing the curtain that separates the dining room and the kitchen as he looks at me with a serious expression. The thing you should know about my brother is he is not a serious man, so seeing him look at me like that had me concerned even before he said. 

“There’s a woman outside, standing in the middle of the road, and she's looking right up at our window” 

“What?” I'd quickly reply in confusion as I pushed past him to the window before feeling his hands grab me for a moment

“Hey! Dont just look. What if she sees you?” 

“She’s already seen you” 

“I know, but im not the one who was attacked by a peacock monster”

“Alright, alright… I'll just peek then” 

He seemed ok with that, at least, as he stepped aside. I moved over to the window, being sure to keep myself out of direct view as I peered down. It was her. Same blue silk, the same thousand-yard stare from eyes that seemed too big for her skull. She was standing there right in the middle of the street, the traffic just passing by her. Occasionally, a car came close to clipping her, but she just remained still, looking up towards the window as no one around her seemed to pay her any mind. 

“Shit” id mutter under my breath.

“What?”

“I saw her the other day, She was following me, Luke and Iris from the mall yesterday”

“Oh. Shit” 

We stared at each other for a moment, both of us trying to decide on our next course of action. I was just about to look out the window again before a knock at the door broke our tense silence. We both snapped our heads to the door, then back at each other as we heard our mom yell out, “Someone answer the door!”. I nod at Archie as we slowly move towards it, the Knocking echoing through the house again as we stand on either side of it. I take a deep breath and move to the centre of the door, looking through the peephole. 

I then let out a long sigh and opened the door to an Uber Eats driver, who was delivering some Ice Cream my Sister had brought for dessert, what happened next made me feel like an idiot, as I go to place the Ice Cream in the Fridge, which put me in clear view of the window i was trying to avoid. I looked down and saw that not only was that woman still standing there, but she now had company. Two more. One on either side, both different looking but dressed identically. One was a lot taller and slender, the other was a bit more broad-shouldered. 

Once they spotted me, I saw the three of them make a B-Line for our building's front door, followed by 3 more identically dressed women that I hadn't spotted before. 

“Fuck” I say almost involuntarily as I run to the door, making sure its locked as I turn to face Archie “They saw me, they're coming” 

“They?”

“There's more of them. 6 I counted” 

Without hesitation, Archie would say, “I know what to do”, as he ran over to the sink, nearly yanking the door off its hinges and pulling a full handgun from behind the pipes. Im not too into guns, so Im not sure about the specific model, but it was some kind of revolver. He began loading it quickly. 

“Mom's gonna kill you for having that in her house, you know”

“Yeah, but you're happy I have it”

He was right, admittedly if there was any time that having a nutcase for a brother would be a good thing, im sure this was one of them. I saw him aim at the door as the faint light from the hallway that slipped through the peephole and under the door faded away, blocked by what I can only assume was the small group of stalkers. They begin to hammer at the door, their fists slamming against the wood like sledge hammers as Archie and I stare intently at it. 

My attention was ripped away as Iris walked in, screaming out in a quick yelp as she saw my brother's gun. I quickly move in, stepping away from the door and swapping with Archie as I try to calm her down. 

“What is going on? Why does your brother have a gun? Who's at the Door?”

“You know the woman who was following is the other day”

Shed nod

“Shed outside the door with like 5 other women. I dont know what she wants, but she ran right into the building the moment she saw me.” 

“Ok, why does Archie have a gun? Just call the cops” 

“We will, but we dont know if they are armed. Just go back into the living room, grab Luke and call the cops” 

The door would hammer again as I saw my terrified wife look between me and the only barrier between us and the things outside. She took a deep breath and ran off into the living room. I could hear her telling my parents that they needed to hide, my mother sounding concerned, asking if everything was ok. My dad, on the other hand, always had a good intuition. I heard him stand up from his chair with more energy than a man's head in decades and start ushering my mom and Iris to the other side of the living room. I could hear my sister, though im pretty sure I heard her go into the bathroom earlier. 

Turning my attention back to the door, I saw Archie give me a nod before leaning against the door, keeping the gun close as he eyes through the peephole. I saw a visible look of disgust run across his face as he saw them, but he remained focused. 

“Alright, you fuckers! You better back the Fuck off! Im armed and not afraid to show-” 

His attempt at a threat was quickly cut off, as one of the woman's arms burst through the door, ripping through it like cheap plaster. as i saw the gangly arm coil itself around my brother's neck, slamming him into the door as it attempted to choke him out. It seemed bony, with some areas having strange bulbs and growths, and the skin having a rough and streaky texture, almost as if covered in rows of scars or stretch marks. 

My brother struggled to free himself. As I watched his eyes start to bulge from his head for a moment, i saw him bash the handle of the gun into the thing's elbow, hearing it make a slight squeal as it collided with soft flesh. He then turned the gun towards the door, pointing the barrel right against the wood, before pulling the trigger! Movies never prepare you for how loud a gunshot is, but the ringing in my ears at least gave me something to focus on to steel my nerves a bit. The shot, however, seemed to have no effect. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter and ran over to the door, stabbing it right into the thing's upper arm.

I must have nicked or cut into something as I cut into its soft flesh, and its grip on my brother loosened in a snap, the arm dropping before being yanked through the doorway. Once he was freed, and we were almost certain that door was not going to hold, we ran into the living room with the others, past the dining table and over to the rest of my family, Iris, Luke and my mother being shielded by my father, who was body blocking the three of them. 

“Where did you get a gun!”

My mom screamed out to Archie as Luke was crying, Iris doing her best to comfort him. Before we could explain to my parents what was happening, we heard the loud thud of the kitchen door being knocked off its hinges. Concrete Barking from his dog bed as we heard the odd, squelching footsteps of those things enter the apartment, making their way to the living room, and surrounding us. This was my first time getting a good look at them up close…

Their skin looked fresh, pink, and soft in places, like a baby animal; the only texture was around their joints and the pits of their bodies. Which were coated with rough, scar-like stretch marks. There I was wrong before; their eyes were not too large for their head, but their eyelids were too small, stretched back and barely covering the whites of their eyes. The Teeth were small and pulled apart between the gums, the hair patchy, though not as if parts had fallen out, but as if it hadn't grown out completely. All of them were wearing the same blue silk robe. 

 The one that followed us stood front and center, a pool of red dripping down her chest as a gunshot wound darkened the left side of her chest. The hole seemed to have expanded beyond what a round of that size should have left. Almost like someone poked a hole in stretched plastic. They looked through us, their pale eyes staring directly at Luke. Each of them opened their mouths with strained breaths, all of them speaking in unison, they’re voices an echo of high pitched, screechy words. 

“Give us the child!”

“No!” I shouted back, clutching the knife tighter.

“Give us the child!”

“You’re not taking my son!” “Yeah, get lost!” 

Archie shouted along with me, darting his aim between each one of these hastily grown humans. They didn't take to the threat at all, pushing forward and encroaching on my family. Archie fired another shot, clipping one of them as we saw blood pool from its hip. The gunshot drowned out by my mother screaming, the cries of my son and my own heart beating out of me chest. The walls felt as if they were closing in, and my hand was trembling, but something kept me standing there, stood up and ready to throw down with these things. I clenched my fist around the knife's handle, my knuckles locking up and straining from the grip. They were probably a few feet away from me and a few more from my family. Even though I needed to, I had to. 

With a crash, my sister, who had emerged from the bathroom unnoticed, slammed a chair over the back of one of they’re heads. Its skull cracked open like a watermelon as it slammed to the ground, its body making a wet thumping sound as it hit the hardwood floor. The remaining five turned for a moment as Archie shot again, getting a lucky shot off on another one as it dropped down. 

My sister pounces on another one, though to no avail as it easily bats her into the dry wall, knocking the wind out of her. I charge at the same one with my knife, plunging it in the thing's ribs to no reaction. Two of the remaining ones, while my siblings are caught up, bolt for Luke, charging straight into my father, who acted as a human barrier between them and my son. He swings his fist into one of them, hard knuckle connecting with soft fleshy jaw, knocking it clean off, but it did not stop in its assault. 

The other one lept on my father, gripping his arm and snapping the bone down the middle, the audible crack followed by a pained groan catching our attention. Archie snapped back, raising the gun for a moment before instantly realising that was a bad idea and that he could hit someone he didn't intend to. 

My sister was still catching her breath as i tried to wrestle the knife from the creature's ribs when they shoved my dad to the side. Then, trying to pry my mother away from Iris and Luke. I let go of the knife before I felt a bony hand covered in stretched out flesh slam me down to the floor, hitting my head against it as I felt like everything was knocked out of frame. Through my daze, I looked, reaching an arm out towards my son… 

The Sirens were the next thing I heard, rapidly approaching and growing in volume. For some reason, that worked to spook them, as without wasting a second of precious time, they shot themselves towards the door, some dripping blood, one with its jaw dangling from one side of its face… Two are standing up with heads caved in and shambling out of the apartment like zombies. One of the neighbours must have called the cops. Hell, with all the screaming and gunshots, I'd imagine the entire building called the cops on us. 

Overall, my family is ok. My dad's arm was broken cleanly, so it'll heal fine even at his age; my sister only had a couple of fractures on her ribs. I was concussed but recovered surprisingly fast. My mom and Iris were pretty shaken by the events but were unharmed. They never got to Luke. The Police ruled it as a home invasion, they believed it may be related to the break-in at our house. After we dealt with all the legal stuff and the police investigations, they concluded it must have been a group of women left vengeful after the hospital incident and targeted us due to our son being born with no complications. The strange appearances brought on by drugs or stress. DNA evidence of the creature's blood backed up this theory, as it matched with medical records of one of the mothers who were at the hospital that night and lost their daughter.  

Not that it explains how they walked off gunshots without moving, or how one with their entire head caved in got up and walked away. It also doesn't explain what that thing was that attacked me in my own home a month ago. For now, though, we've replaced the door and have been on high alert for the last day or two. It is just me, Archie, Iris and Luke in the house now. My mom is staying at my dad's place, and my sister is still staying at her girlfriend's. Im not sure what to do next, especially after receiving a letter in the mail. It was a card with an address on it. Looking it up on Google Maps, I found it was a cafe, one that's not too far from my mom's apartment. Also inside the envelope that it came in was a stony silver coin, old and withered, with a woman's head on one side, wearing a reef crown, and a winged horse on the other side. The same kind that the man at the gas station gave me. 

I guess the simple way to ask this is, What should I do?
