My name is Mary, which is hard to complain about. She’s the mother, the most important saint of all. Perhaps it’s a name I’ll grow into when I’m older and have children of my own. 

Given a choice, though, I would have gone with Joan–as in Joan of Arc. She was an instrument of God. And a warrior. Like me.

When the angel first responded to my call, I was horrified, of course. I threw the coin in the well and whispered a name. Then, only a few moments later, it emerged. Of course, I should have known it would be no white figure in flowing robes. 

Still, I could not be prepared for the sheer stench of it, worse than the compost bin in our back pasture, all buzzing with flies. As one might expect, the angel couldn’t quite be seen with human eyes. It seemed to hum in and out of existence, its outline ever-changing. Within its shape, I could tell there were many beasts: deer and wolves, and people too.

Later, I would pull out my bible and read Ezekiel, finding solace in the description there:

*Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.*

For a moment, the angel peered down at me, and I tried to smile back, knowing the righteous mission I had summoned it to carry out. Then, quick as anything, it sped away, off to do its justice.

I had never set out to be an instrument of God’s justice, at least, not in any particular way. I’ve always tried to do the right thing, of course, and to keep dark thoughts at bay. 

All my life, I listened to my parents, and never fought going to church like my brothers, even on sunny days when I’d have preferred to be outside.

It all started in church, naturally. I had been assigned to gather the donations, wielding a bowl attached to a small stick. We are discouraged from looking at the amounts of money different patrons contribute, of course, but curiosity often gets the better of me.

Most people slip in a ten or a twenty, maybe a one or a five if times are hard. Usually something. But when I held the bowl out to Mr. Reddy that Sunday, he reached into his pockets and started taking out stack after stack of neatly-wrapped hundred dollar bills. Almost gleefully, he tossed the bundles of cash into the bowl, which dipped under their weight.

“Want one?” he asked, meeting my eyes. We were near the back of the church, away from most of the other patrons, which struck me as unusual. Usually, he sat right up front with his sister’s family, passing out hard candies to his nieces and nephews when they got squirrelly.

“How much is that?” I whispered.

He held up a bundle. 

“Ten thousand,” he said. “What would you buy with it?”

“I don’t know,” I said, though there were a dozen things I could have asked for: a truck for my dad that didn’t break down every other week. New clothes for me and my brothers. A visit to the dentist for my mom to finally take care of her aching back molar.

“Take it,” he said. “You need it more than this fucking place.” He gestured up at the intricate stained glass above us. “You think that shit is free?” I realized now that his hands were shaking and his eyes were rimmed red. I didn’t smell alcohol on his breath, though. That was what made most men in our congregation act this way. A small trickle of blood was oozing from one nostril.

“I don’t want it,” I said. “The church will do some good with it. They’ll think of something better than anything I could come up with.”

“How old are you?” he asked.

“Twelve. Almost thirteen.”

He laughed.

“Good little girl, aren’t you?” he said, to which I didn’t respond. He dropped the last bundle of bills in the bowl. There were five bundles in all, fifty thousand dollars if my math was right.

I turned to leave, but he reached out and grabbed my wrist.

“Wait,” he said. “You really are good, aren’t you?” He seemed almost on the verge of tears. 

I looked around, hoping someone might see him grabbing me, but the rest of the congregation was fixated on the hymn they were singing. 

“If you want, I can give you something a thousand times more precious than that little bundle of cash. But you can’t be this meek. So I’m going to ask you this. Are you actually *good?* Or just obedient?”

“I don’t know,” I said quietly, trying not to scream.

“Yes you do,” he said.

“I have to go,” I said, trying to pull away and nearly dropping the bowl of money.

“I don’t have much time left,” he said. “If you want, I’ll be at the Mitchell Well at midnight. Come alone. I’ll be waiting. Don’t be late.”

Then he let me go. I turned and began to walk away through the singing congregation, trying not to cry, trying not to run.

After church, father took Gabe and Joshua to their confirmation class while mother and I waited outside. It was a cold, fall day, and I’d only brought a thin old jacket. The leaves on the trees had lost all color and clattered loudly at even the faintest breeze. I hoped it wouldn’t rain.

As we sat on a bench outside the church, waiting for them, mother opened her Bible and encouraged me to do the same. I tried to comply, but I’d already read the whole thing a dozen times or more, and the words were turning to soup in my brain. 

Finally, I closed my book, made sure no one else was around, and asked mother what she thought of Mr. Reddy.

“He’s an important man,” my mother said. “Why do you ask?”

“Just, something funny happened during Collection today. He put in more money than he usually does.”

I could sense her irritation before she spoke.

“You know you’re not supposed to look at the amount each parishioner puts in.”

“Forgive me,” I said. “My curiosity got the better of me.”

I waited for a moment after that. My mother was quick to anger, especially when I’d broken a rule. I wondered if Joan of Arc had been terrified of her parents.

“Do you think I’m good or just obedient?” I asked after a bit of silence.

“Today, I’d say you’re neither,” she replied. 

“I want to be good,” I said quietly. “What can I do to be good?”

“Read,” she said, gesturing to the book in my lap.

That night, I lay in bed, watching the clock. I pictured Mr. Reddy in his thick winter coat, trudging through the mud toward the Mitchell Well. Of course, that wasn’t its real name. It was the Deathwish Well. Even I knew that.

I had never snuck out of the house before. Never even considered it. I knew I’d catch hell from mother and father if I got caught, a hundred times worse than anything they’d done before. And they’d done plenty. 

Once, when mother caught me with a magazine I’d stolen from the grocery store, she ordered me to sit at the table, arms bare and exposed. Then she tore out of of the pages from the magazine and set the thin part on the tender skin of my wrist. Quickly, she drew it across. The skin tore along a thin line, immediately dotted with blood. I had never felt such a painful thing in my life.

I screamed and screamed, but my mother just started at me, her face cold with judgment.

“I take no joy in this, Mary, but you must learn.”

“I’m sorry,” I shrieked. “I’m sorry.”

“The other one now,” she said, gesturing to my right arm.

And then, slowly, obediently, I complied.

All around, the house was quiet, save for a soft sound of snoring coming down the hall from my parents’ room. They all slept deeply. Some mornings, I woke and crept downstairs, reading books I’d snuck home from the school library. As long as I kept them in my backpack, no one ever thought to check. Part of being a good girl meant never getting caught.

I looked outside at the moonless dark. I thought of Mr. Reddy again and the way he’d held my wrist. It was certainly possible that he was planning to kill me, or worse. If I had been obedient, truly obedient, I would have stayed in bed.

But obedient wasn’t enough. And neither was fear. Neither would keep me in the house that night.

I dressed quickly and slipped out the back door, the one that didn’t creak. The night air was colder than I expected but oddly intoxicating, the way I imagined a drug must feel. My skin tingled, and the few lights illuminating the neighbors’ houses seemed to pulse in the wet air.

I walked for maybe ten minutes before I reached the dirt road leading to the Deathwish Well. It was utterly dark here, and of course I’d neglected to bring a flashlight. At first, I tripped over every rock and pothole in my path, but slowly my eyes adjusted to the faint starlight. 

As I struggled to see, my other senses began to wake. Small snaps of twigs and steps in the grass alerted me to the presence of nearby birds and deer. I had heard of mountain lion sightings, of course, but figured I was too big for them to target. At least, that’s what I tried to tell myself.

I thought of Mr. Reddy, too, of course. I imagined him tackling me from the side of the road. I imagined him taking a gleaming knife and stabbing me over and over, calling me a good little girl as I choked to death on my own blood.

Fear screamed inside me, and then Mr. Reddy’s voice added to the cacophony: *Are you actually good? Or just obedient?*

I didn’t turn back. I kept walking. Soon, I passed the ruined house and knew I was almost to the well. As I approached, I small a small orange glow before me, the first light I’d seen in ages. I thought of the shepherds following the star. Then, as I approached it, I realized it was the lit tip of a cigarette.

“Brave girl,” I heard Mr. Reddy say. I could just barely make out his features from the glow of his cigarette.

“I told you I was good,” I said quietly.

He took a long drag and then laughed.

“Fuck,” he said. I wasn’t sure if I’d ever heard an adult man say the word in front of me before. “I guess we’d better get this over with before the others show up.” Though it was hard to read his eyes, I could tell he was nervous, peering around the darkness.

He opened his hand and revealed a coin.

“Take it,” he said. 

“What is it?” I asked, reaching forward.

“It’s a wish,” he said. “Thousand wishes.”

Carefully, trying to touch his skin as little as possible, I took the coin from his hand. He seemed to sigh a little as I did, as if he’d just set down a great weight.

“It’s yours now,” he said.

“What do I do with it?”

He gestured to the well.

“Toss it in. Say a name of someone who deserves a little punishment.”

“That’s not for me to decide,” I said.

“Sure it is,” he said. “You know good from bad, right? That’s why I gave it to you. I know you’ll use it better than I ever did.”

I walked toward the well. I almost felt I couldn’t stop myself. The coin felt warm in my hand, like it was begging to be cooled in the icy water down below.

“Say a name,” he said.

“Who?” I asked.

“You know!” he shout “You know!”

And then, all at once, I tossed it in. The coin hissed in the wet air and dinged against the sides of the well until it finally plopped into the water. Then, from down below, I heard something low and guttural, something unlike any sound I’d heard before.

“It needs a name,” he said. “You don’t want to keep it waiting. Trust me.”

I was breathing harder now. My mind was blank. I wasn’t god, was I? How was I supposed to sort out the saints from the sinners?

From down below, the sound was getting louder. Closer.

“A name!” he shouted, and now the sound was almost upon us.

And then, it came to me with perfect clarity, as if the word was spoken by Michael, or Gabriel, or God himself. It was so clear, so certain. It must have been Joan of Arc must have felt when she first heard the voice, knew the truth of it. And though I couldn’t stop shaking with fear, I repeated the word.

“Mother,” I whispered into [the cool night air.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
