No matter if I was home no matter if I was outside they said not to look for the "invisible Ghost" 

Me and my family moved to Russia because my baby sister was born and we didn't have much space in our house

,then one day my dad got a job in Russia so we moved to Russia,when we arrived at our new neighbourhood some people came to our doorstep and welcomed us,

in the middle of talking the people told our parents to bring me somewhere else where I couldn't be there listening to their conversation,

I wondered why they wanted me out of there but I just didn't say anything and went into my room,tho I could hear everything with my door open just a little inch

,they were talking about the "Invisible ghost" that it always went to people's houses every night at exactly 3::05 my mom was s like "is this a prank or something? To scare us out of this neighbourhood"

The neighbor's tone turned serious, and they leaned in closer to my parents. "No, this is not a prank. The Invisible Ghost is a real entity, and it's been terrorizing our neighborhood for years. It's said to appear at exactly 3:05 AM, every night, without fail."

My mom raised an eyebrow, still skeptical. "And what does it do when it appears?"

The neighbor hesitated, glancing around nervously. "Some people say it whispers terrible things in their ears. Others claim it manipulates their dreams, making them see and experience horrific things. And then there are those who say it's a harbinger of doom, a sign that something terrible is about to happen."

My dad's expression turned grave. "We'll make sure to keep an eye out for it. Thank you for warning us."

As the neighbors left, I couldn't shake off the feeling lthat something was off. Why did they seem so scared of this "Invisible Ghost"? And what did it really want?

That night, I lay in bed, my ears perked up, waiting for 3:05 AM. I didn't believe in ghosts or supernatural entities, but a part of me was curious.

As the clock struck 3:05, I held my breath. At first, there was silence. But then, I started to feel a creeping sense of dread. It was as if someone was watching me, lurking just out of sight.

Suddenly, I heard a faint whisper in my ear. "GHOST'S WATCHING."

My heart skipped a beat. Who or what was behind that voice? And what did it want from me?

Tap tap tap at the window

I froze, my heart racing as I heard the faint tapping at the window. It was a soft, rhythmic pattern, like someone was trying to get my attention without being too loud.

I slowly got out of bed and approached the window, my eyes scanning the darkness outside. The tapping grew louder, more insistent, and I could feel a presence on the other side of the glass.

As I peered into the night, I saw a figure standing just beyond the window, shrouded in shadows. The tapping grew more urgent, and I felt a chill run down my spine.

Suddenly, the figure vanished, and the tapping stopped. The silence was oppressive, and I was left standing there, wondering if I had just imagined the whole thing.

But then, I saw it. A message, scrawled on the windowpane in faint, icy letters:

"GHOST'S WATCHING"

I stumbled backward, my mind reeling with fear. What did this entity want from me? And how was it able to tap on my window, to leave me messages in the dead of night?

What I didn't know is my parents saw me looking out and my dad was wary of what I saw so from then on 
my dad always locked the windows and hid the keys 

because the people from earlier did say "don't look for the ghost and don't open any doors or windows cuz it might get in" I was honestly freaked out to say the least 

as I slept throught the night i saw a figure in my dreams
Tall,wearing a hoodie,with glowing red eyes that stared into my soul then it slowly made out a twisted creepy smile that terrorized the hell out of me

As the days go by, the atmosphere in the house grows thicker with tension. My parents are on edge, and I can sense that they're hiding something from me.

One night, I decide to sneak out of my room and explore the house. I creeped downstairs, trying not to make a sound. As I reach the bottom step, I hear a faint whispering in my ear.

"GHOST'S WATCHING"

I spin around, but there's no one there. The whisper seems to come from all around me, echoing off the walls.

Suddenly, the lights flicker and die. I'm plunged into darkness, surrounded by an oppressive silence.

As I stand there, frozen in fear, I see a small, flickering light in the distance. It's a tiny, dancing flame that seems to be hovering in mid-air. The light is soft and blue-ish, and it seems to be pulsing with a gentle, otherworldly energy.

As I watch, mesmerized, the flame begins to move closer to me. It floats through the air, leaving a trail of sparkling, glittering particles in its wake. The light is hypnotic, and I feel myself being drawn towards it, as if it's exerting some kind of strange, mystical pull.

Suddenly, the flame vanishes, and I'm plunged back into darkness. But as I stand there, trying to process what just happened, I hear a faint whispering in my ear.

"GHOST'S WATCHING"

This time, the voice is louder, more insistent. It's as if the Invisible Ghost is trying to tell me something, to convey a message that only I can hear.

My parents' eyes fluttered open, groggy with sleep. They looked at me, confused, and then their expressions changed to alarm as they saw the fear etched on my face.

"What's wrong?" my mom whispered, sitting up in bed.

I tried to speak, but my voice was shaking. "I...I heard something," I stammered. "The Ghost...it spoke to me."

My dad's face turned pale, and he threw off the covers. "What did it say?" he demanded.

I swallowed hard, trying to repeat the words. "It said... 'TRAPPED...IN...MY...VOID'."

My mom's eyes went wide, and she grabbed my dad's arm. "We have to get out of here," she whispered urgently. "Now."

As my mom rushed downstairs with my baby sister in her arms, I could sense a growing sense of panic in the air. My dad was already by the front door, fumbling with the locks and chains, trying to get us out of the house as quickly as possible.

"Come on, come on!" he whispered urgently, his eyes darting nervously around the room.

My mom reached the bottom of the stairs and handed my baby sister to me. "Take your sister and get out of here, now!" she ordered, her voice trembling with fear.

As I took my sister in my arms, I could feel her tiny heart beating rapidly against my chest. She was crying softly, sensing the tension and fear that surrounded us.

Suddenly, I heard a faint whispering in my ear. "YOU...CAN'T...ESCAPE..."

I pulled and pulled on the front door handle, but it wouldn't move. It was as if the door had become stuck, or worse, had been sealed shut by some unseen force.

My dad's face turned red with effort as he tried to force the door open. He grunted and strained, but it wouldn't budge.

"It's like it's been locked from the inside," he muttered, his voice laced with frustration and fear.

My mom's eyes were wide with panic. "What do we do?" she whispered, clutching my baby sister tightly to her chest.

I looked around, feeling a sense of desperation creeping in. The windows were locked, the back door was blocked by a heavy bookshelf, and now the front door was stuck.

We were trapped.

And then, I heard the whispering again, louder this time. "YOU...SHOULD...NOT...HAVE...TRIED...TO...LEAVE..."

The doors and windows shook violently, as if the very foundations of the house were being torn apart. My family and I were paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak.

And then, our eyes fell upon the crumpled piece of note under the couch. It was as if it had been deliberately placed there, waiting for us to discover it.

The drawing of a black hole seemed to suck all the light out of the room, leaving only an eerie, pulsating darkness. The red letters beside it seemed to burn with an otherworldly intensity, as if they were a warning, a prophecy, or a promise.

"IN THIS VOID YOU WILL GO"

The words seemed to echo through my mind, resonating with a terrible, creeping sense of inevitability. It was as if we were being pulled towards some dark, abyssal fate, and there was nothing we could do to escape.

My mom's voice was barely audible, a faint whisper of terror. "What does it mean?"

My dad's face was ashen, his eyes wide with fear. "I don't know, but I think we're about to find out."

My parents went into their room,As my parents emerged from their room, armed with the axe and bat, I could sense a mix of desperation and determination in their eyes. They were ready to defend us against whatever was coming our way.

My mom held the axe tightly, its heavy blade glinting in the dim light. My dad gripped the bat firmly, his knuckles white with tension.

"We need to get out of here," my dad whispered, his eyes scanning the room. "We can't stay trapped in this house."

My mom nodded, her eyes fixed on the door. "We'll make a run for it. Stay close, and don't let go of your sister."

I nodded, holding my baby sister tightly to my chest. I could feel her tiny heart racing with fear, and I knew I had to protect her at all costs.

As we prepared to make our move, the house seemed to grow quieter, as if it was holding its breath in anticipation of what was to come. The air was thick with tension, and I could feel the weight of the unknown pressing down upon us.

Suddenly, the lights flickered and died, plunging us into darkness. The house was silent, except for the sound of my own ragged breathing...

Knock knock knock at the door

The knocking was slow, deliberate, and menacing. It echoed through the darkness, making my heart skip a beat. My parents exchanged a nervous glance, their eyes gleaming with fear in the dim light.

My mom's grip on the axe tightened, while my dad's hand clenched around the bat. I held my baby sister closer, trying to shield her from the terror that was unfolding.

The knocking grew louder, more insistent. It was as if whatever was on the other side of the door was determined to get our attention.

My dad's voice was barely above a whisper. "Don't answer it."

But it was too late. The knocking had already stopped. Instead, I heard a low, ominous whispering. "LET...ME...IN...OR...CONSEQUENCES..."

As the figure's eyes glowed brighter, its body began to contort and twist, like a puppet on a string. Its limbs elongated and distorted, taking on unnatural shapes.

My mom's grip on the axe faltered, and she stumbled backward, horror etched on her face. My dad's eyes were frozen on the figure, his bat slipping from his grasp.

I was paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak. The figure's eyes seemed to be burning with an otherworldly intensity, and I felt myself being drawn into their depths.

The figure's body continued to twist and contort, its skin rippling and bubbling like a living thing. And then, in a voice that was both familiar and yet completely alien, it spoke.

"I...AM...YOU..."

I was shocked and horrified as the figure transformed into a twisted, psycho version of my mom. Her eyes, once warm and loving, now blazed with a manic intensity, her pupils constricted into tiny, venomous dots.

Her skin was deathly pale, pulled taut over her cheekbones, and her smile was a grotesque, exaggerated parody of her normal warm smile. She looked like a caricature of my mom, a twisted, nightmarish version that seemed to be fueled by a malevolent energy.

"Mom?" I whispered, my voice shaking with fear. "What's going on?"

The psycho-mom's eyes locked onto mine, and she began to laugh, a cold, mirthless sound that sent shivers down my spine.

"I'M...THE...REAL...MOM..." she hissed, her voice dripping with malice. "AND...YOU...WILL...OBEY..."

My real mom's eyes were wide with terror as she stared at the twisted, psycho version of herself. She looked like she was frozen in shock, unable to move or speak.

The psycho-mom began to move closer to me, her eyes fixed on me with an unnerving intensity. My real mom finally snapped out of her trance-like state and lunged forward, grabbing my arm and pulling me back.

"Run!" she whispered urgently, her eyes darting towards the psycho-mom. "We have to get out of here!"

But it was too late. The psycho-mom was already too close, her twisted smile growing wider as she reached out to grab me...

She grabbed me

The psycho-mom's grip on my arm was like a vice, her fingers digging deep into my skin. I tried to shake her off, but she held tight, her eyes blazing with a malevolent intensity.

My real mom tried to intervene, but the psycho-mom was too strong. She shoved my real mom aside, sending her crashing to the floor.

As I struggled to break free, the psycho-mom leaned in close, her breath cold and rank. "YOU'RE...MINE...NOW," she hissed, her voice dripping with malice.

I felt a wave of terror wash over me as I realized I was trapped, at the mercy of this twisted, psycho version of my mom...

My dad's face was red with effort as he tried to pull me away from the psycho-mom's grasp. He was a strong guy, but the psycho-mom seemed to have an unnatural strength, as if she was fueled by a dark and malevolent energy.

The two of them engaged in a fierce tug-of-war, with me caught in the middle. I felt like I was being pulled apart, my arm stretched to the breaking point.

For a moment, it seemed like my dad was gaining the upper hand, pulling me closer to him. But then, the psycho-mom's grip tightened, and she pulled me back with a sudden, violent jerk.

My dad stumbled backward, his eyes wide with fear and desperation. "No!" he shouted, launching himself at the psycho-mom once again. "Let him go!"

It was too late

The psycho-mom's grip was too strong, and she pulled me into a dark and abyssal void. I felt myself being sucked away from my family, away from the only world I had ever known.

As I was dragged deeper into the void, I saw my family's desperate faces fade into the distance. My mom's screams echoed through the void, growing fainter and fainter until they were silenced.

The last thing I saw was my dad's anguished face, his eyes wide with horror and helplessness. And then, everything went black.

I was consumed by the void, trapped in a living nightmare from which I might never awaken. The psycho-mom's cackling laughter echoed through the darkness, a haunting reminder that I was at her mercy...

I woke up with a start, my heart racing and my sheets drenched in sweat. It took me a moment to realize that it was all just a dream. The relief washed over me like a wave, and I let out a shaky breath.

As I sat up in bed, I looked around my darkened room, trying to reassure myself that everything was okay. The shadows on the wall seemed to loom over me, but I knew it was just my imagination playing tricks on me.

I threw off the covers and got out of bed, padding over to the window to pull back the curtains. The moon was full outside, casting an silver glow over the room.

I took a deep breath, feeling my heart rate slow down. It was just a dream, I told myself. It didn't mean anything.

But as I turned to go back to bed, I caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye. A piece of paper on my bedside table, with a message scrawled on it in red ink:

"IT'S NOT JUST A DREAM..."

THE END
