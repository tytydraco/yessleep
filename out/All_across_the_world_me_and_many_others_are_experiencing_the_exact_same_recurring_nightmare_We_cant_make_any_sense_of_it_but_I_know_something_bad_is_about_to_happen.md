**Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *lur00p*

Been posting this EVERYWHERE hoping to find others with the same problem. Anybody else have nightmares about patterns of a women’s faces? They’re fused together like the ends of a playing card except in every direction. (This isn’t a very good description, sorry).

I’ve been having the nightmares more and more lately, so thought I’d do a post. I haven't had a good nights sleep for weeks.

Are you me? Sounds like the nightmares I’ve been having since FOREVER! When I told my mom about them she just made a face like I grew horns. They got really bad last month so I went to a doctor who gave me meds which kinda helped. I still get them but less intense.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *DogsCanCryToo*

Huh, thought I was the only one.

The way I explain the dream to people is this: repeating fractal faces sliding into one another like a gigantic, unending kaleidoscope. Is that close to what you’re experiencing?

I’ve struggled with these nightmares since adolescence, although they’ve become more frequent lately. Comforting to know there’s others out there.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *electricalbuttercup*

I’m in the same boat. Dogscancrytoo you nailed the description.

I’ve been researching this phenomenon and might have an explanation. Google ‘Biblically Accurate Angels’. Maybe we’re all lapsed Sunday school kids? Mix two tablespoons of violent religious imagery with a pinch of sleep disorder and…viola.

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *robobiscuit*

This post could have been written by me. I’m a little spooked actually. I mean it’s nice to know I’m not alone, but still.

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *ihatecaramel*

I. Have. Found. My. People.

Sooooo maybe don’t click this if the multi-monster-face-lady freaks you out, but I’ve posted drawings of her on my Instagram <redacted>

Is this close to what everybody’s seeing?

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *littiepinkmint*

Oh wow you’re an AMAZING artist. Followed! And why is this so accurate? I’d say it’ll give me nightmares but…yeah 😂

P.S. I wanna steal your doggo! So cute! 😍😍😍

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *ihatecaramel*

Thank you kindly. And she is cute. Her name’s Ziggy and she loves belly scratches and the beach, which you can probably guess from the photos. :D

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *robobiscuit*

Okay, the dreams have gotten worse. These past few nights some of the ladies’ mouths have been shrieking.

Kinda regret finding this thread tbh.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *electricalbuttercup*

Don’t panic. The same thing happened to me. Because we’ve discussed our experiences, we’ve made ourselves anxious, which is making the nightmares more intense. Classic chicken-egg scenario.

Try meditating for 20 minutes before sleep, along with quiet, calming activities (such as a jigsaw or reading). I’ve found both to be excellent coping mechanisms.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *DogsCanCryToo*

Robobiscuit, I had this experience too. As it happens, I’m discovering there is less ‘dream fog’ these days (although when I wake up the nightmares are by no means ‘clear’).

The best way I can describe these latest nightmares is to say for every one hundred faces, two or three will have their mouths expand wider and wider until *different* faces emerge from the gaps and fill up the original faces ‘space’ in the pattern, then open *their* mouths and makes a sound like a mix between a phone left off the hook and the hiss of static you got using a dial-up modem.

There’s also a vague sense of *familiarity* about the ‘entity’ as I call it.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *littiepinkmint*

OMG I searched dialup modem on YouTube and I heard that too! 😮😮

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *DogsCanCryToo*

You needed to look up what a modem sounded like? Well now I’m more concerned with getting old than the nightmares…

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *electricalbuttercup*

The problem is we’re spreading our personal anxieties like a contagion. robobiscuit ‘Inceptioned’ us.

Anybody else from a religious family? Gullible parents + charismatic leader = my hippie family living with a bunch of heaven’s gate wannabes.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *DogsCanCryToo*

Thinking about it, you may be onto something. I hesitated to share this, but my wife’s been encouraging me to open up about my childhood, so perhaps this is a good first step…

I was raised in a cult called the Temple of the First Mother. There’s not a lot of information online because they were relatively small, but a Youtuber made a true crime documentary based on the (very limited) information available. A fellow survivor (a female child member my age) went public and agreed to be interviewed about her experience.

Definitely feels like there’s a connection.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *littiepinkmint*

WTF I asked my mom over the phone if my birth parents were super religious and she started crying???

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *littiepinkmint*

My mom called back and said my bio-mom was in a cult! 😮😮 She said she got a bunch of documents and stuff and they’re in a box in the attic. She’s gonna find it. WTFFF.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *robobiscuit*

Anybody else freaking out? I’m adopted too, and I have some hazy memories about a church that I think matches the description. I don’t have much information about my birth parents because my dad moved us to Dublin to work for the embassy when I was still young. He died last year so I don’t know how to get any info, but reading the First Mother’s case notes is like getting drip fed my own repressed childhood.

I kinda remember a desert, weird contests, and maybe a Nintendo? This make any sense to anyone?

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *littiepinkmint*

Holy crap my mom was in the cult and she exposed everything to the police before she died! This is CRAZY. I’m literally shaking rn. Dogs did you know my mom????

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *DogsCanCryToo*

I’ve tried responding to you all a few times, but my hands tremble whenever I do. Let’s try this once more with feeling…

Mint, if you’re who I think you are then I knew your mother. And I know you. *Sort of.*

Was her name Kelly? If so, she was the youngest adult at the compound. I was the oldest kid.

The leader was a maniac called Samael. I liked him because my mom and I were bouncing between shelters before he ‘saved’ us and took us in and gave us our own beds to sleep in.

My mom suffered from severe health issues and Kelly took care of her (I believe she was a nurse before joining?). Samael’s main ‘assistant’ Lidia caught them several times and punished us. She always said, “Suffering is cleansing.”

They had this terrible murder-ritual planned out for us, but a few days before, Kelly decided to escape. My Mom was too weak to accompany her but begged Kelly to take me, so she shook me awake one night and said we were playing a game and to keep quiet.

If it is you, you started crying while your mom cut a hole in the fence, and I made silly faces and blew raspberries until you settled down.

The march across the desert left me with blisters larger than tennis balls. Kelly had a bad case of heatstroke and several pre-existing injuries, but she still carried us both a lot of the way. She shared a ton of information with the police but died in hospital three days later from all physical trauma. My mom was dead by the time they raided the compound because Samael figured out what happened and went ballistic.

I always wanted to track down Kelly’s daughter and say thank you, but most of us kids got placed with adoptive families and given new identities.

Caramel, I went back and checked your Instagram—you *definitely* look like a younger boy I remember.

And Robobiscuit, yes, Samael was big on pitting us against each other. We needed to demonstrate our dedication to the Mother through hymns and memorizing religious texts and endless prayer. For our ‘downtime’, we had an old Nintendo 64 and a TV hooked up to a generator. Do you have black hair and freckles? If so, you always cried if we didn’t let you play as Yoshi.

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *littiepinkmint*

That’s her! All I knew about her was she worked as a nurse! This is crazy! I’m crying rn. She’s the reason I’m studying to become a doctor!

What was my mom like? Was she nice?

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *DogsCanCryToo*

She was brave and compassionate, and if you’re half the wonderful person she was you’ll make a world-class doc!

Mint, if it’s alright with you, I’d like to meet in person as thanks to your bio-mom for rescuing me, and everything she did for *my* mom.

My contact number is <redacted> and my email is <redacted>. Please please please get in touch.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *robobiscuit*

Fucking hell. I’ve been digging into these nutjobs for days now and pieces of memories are rushing back. The only thing I clearly remember is this kid called Drew, is that anybody here’s name? (I guess if it was it would have been changed after the trial?). If not, does it ring any bells? I think he was my best friend. He had a scraggily hair and sunken cheekbones and eyes. Probably because we never ate. If the case notes are right, his mom said she was coerced into joining and they got placed in a protection program.

The manifesto for this group is…something.

*The first mother believed all of humanity are the offspring of an Angel who birthed all life on Earth as a means of entering our realm. Through ritual torture, which resulted in the deaths of nine men and six women, they planned on summoning the ‘Mother’ to our world, in an event likened to the New Testament rapture.*

So this means we’re all from this SAME cult and having a SHARED nightmare? And it’s suddenly getting worse? Am I the only one panicking? Is this the part where we find out the former leader escaped from prison?

Electricalbuttercup, please tell me your family weren’t members?

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *electricalbuttercup*

Whether they were or not doesn’t matter, this thread has become a group of sick people feeding off each others delusions.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *DogsCanCryToo*

So, it’s been an emotional few days. There’s lots to cover.

Firstly, Mint and I have a reunion planned. My wife and I are driving over to meet her in <redacted> tonight.

Hopefully I can fill in some gaps for you all. There were seven kids in the cult. Me (the oldest), a baby (mint), four younger boys (possibly Robo, electrical, camel, and lur00p?), and a girl called <redacted>, who gave the interview on YouTube. And I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news about her—she died last month. Poor thing fell from a second-story window. There’s an article about her accident. It doesn’t mention her involvement with the First Mother but that’s definitely her.

Robo, I remember Drew. His mother was Lidia, who acted as Samael’s assistant, and it boils my blood to this day how she got away with her coercion story. She ran things when Samael wasn’t around and her ‘cleansing’ rituals are what made my mom ill in the first place. As a child, I was terrified she might track us all down and complete the ceremony. The good news is she died from a heart attack six years ago.

You don’t have to worry about Samael either. Thanks to the useless investigators bungling crucial evidence, the bastard managed to skirt the murder charges, however he’s still serving a 150-year sentence for all the trafficking and forced labour convictions.

The ‘ritual’ we narrowly avoided essentially involved us all dying. We were groomed to want to give our lives for the mother. Mercifully I imagine most of you are young enough to have forgotten this.

I’ll happily answer any other questions you might have.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *littiepinkmint*

Sorry I’m only seeing this now. I got really ill after the last nightmare so I’ve been in the hospital.

I’d like to meet, but we need to plan it out first. Why are you driving to <redacted>? I’m closer to <redacted>. I can’t get an answer on your phone. Email me at <redacted>.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *robobiscuit*

I just had the worst nightmare yet. There were even more faces ‘spilling’ out of the others, but their singing was so loud I woke up with a giant headache and my ears ringing. I had to pace around for ten minutes before my head stopped pounding. Anybody else?

And Dogs, you’re right. They felt familiar.

I’ve remembered some more. Drew wouldn’t play Nintendo or anything because he prayed so much. I remember he was OBSESSED with the competition. Am I right in saying Samuel would track who showed the most ‘loyalty’ every week and pick them to kneel beside him at the altar? I’m pretty sure it was usually Drew.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *littiepinkmint*

Dogs and I spoke over zoom. We both cried a TON. He was really nice but we’re not gonna meet yet. A married couple got stabbed outside my hometown so I don’t want to take a risk. I’ve spoke to a therapist who thinks I’m stressing myself out reading this stuff so this will be my last post. Bye everyone. I wish you all the best. 😊

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *robobiscuit*

These dreams are getting worse. I’m waking up with heart palpitations now and can’t sleep for more than twenty minutes.

The cogs in my memory are really fucking turning. I remember Samael preaching about how we were the mothers link to this world and what an honour it’ll be to die. Dogs, did he used to say us kids were like a beacon? I remember something about being the mother’s link to this world. I kinda remember the last verse of a hymn we used to sing went something like: O Mother, something something rivers of blood something fire raining from the sky?

The rest of you are coming back to me. I remember Dogs was tall and ginger. The blonde girl was taller than him with big front teeth. Pinks, you had a button nose.

I also remember Drew was HARDCORE into connecting with the ‘Mother’. Like he always talked about wanting to join with her? What are we meant to do? I can’t sleep. I’m feeling sick.

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *robobiscuit*

Am I the only one still posting here? Hello?

\--

**Re: Wild recurring nightmare about a lady with ‘repeating’ faces**, *electricalbuttercup*

Robobiscuit, I was wrong. This can’t possibly be psychosomatic.

We were all meant to die. I struggled with the guilt for years. Samael said we all needed to die for the Mother to strengthen her connection with our world, and that the last one standing would have the honour of becoming her host.

This thread was a mistake. I can’t take the nightmares anymore. I’m sorry. Good luck. And goodbye.

\--

That night, I had the worst nightmare yet and sat bolt upright, heart thrashing against my chest.

From downstairs, I could hear the backdoor lock jiggle around. There was no time to call for help, so I pulled on a pair of sweatpants.

Without making a sound, I rushed to the window, pushed it open, and slid myself through backwards. By the time I'd climbed halfway down the wall, the bedroom door crashed open. An intruder had burst into my bedroom.

I dropped onto a hedge, scrambled across the driveway into my car, and sped away twenty miles over the limit.

I called the police on my mobile. Two officers searched every room and confirmed no valuables had been stolen. That meant the intruder came for *me*.

I checked into a hotel sixty miles from my city. By now, the nightmares had seeped into the real world. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw smiling faces, much clearer now, each sliding into one another as they laughed and sang and told me they couldn't wait for me join with 'Mother. Just like them.

Using my laptop, I combed through the thread to figure out what the hell was going on. Dogscancrytoo mentioned visiting a city, so I Googled it and found an article about a husband and wife who recently got shot to death inside their car. According to the article, they died two days *before* Mints supposed Zoom call with Dogs. I called the number Dogs posted but his line had been disconnected.

I then checked Mints hometown, only to discover a story about a nineteen-year-old girl whose roommate found her outside her apartment, strangled to death.

Finally, I clicked onto Caramels Instagram. Since joining the forum he hasn’t posted a single photo.

That's when it hit me. As more survivors died, the 'Mothers' link with the remaining few grew stronger. More intense. Now that she'd spilled out of my nightmares it had become obvious *where* I recognized the other faces from—they were my fellow children imprisoned at the compound. And there was only one kid I remembered from back then who *didn’t* appear each time I closed my eyes.

And so, with a weary sigh, I returned to the forum and made one final post…
