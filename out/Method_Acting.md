“Female aged 20 to 22. Clare, supporting role. Brown/chestnut hair. Fresh out of school. Adventurous personality and a little rough around the edges.” 



Based on that short job listing, I thought Jessica had a good chance of getting the part. When she did, I was delighted. I remember the light in her eyes when she burst into the room to tell me. This meant something to her, more than just a role in a movie. She told me it proved something, not just to her but to her parents. That the years she had spent in college were worth it. This would be something she could be proud of. She’s been taking the bus to and from Vancouver since then. 



The film is being produced by the upcoming film studio: *Borderline Pictures.* Initially I was suspicious of the studio. They don’t have a website… or almost any information when you look them up online. Neither did the film’s Polish director, Youry Nowak, have any previous work. *At least now she can say she’s been paid for something in her field,* I had thought. *Hopefully it’ll be easier for her to get more work after this experience, whether or not the film does well.* 



I’m writing this post because of an incident at the studio which occurred yesterday. Before then, I had seen none of her work. 



I had been excited all week—since Jessica had given me the invitation to tour the studio. She explained it would be a small group, (just the crew’s close friends and family). The plan was to show us the props department and some of the sets being assembled. It was going to be on a Saturday which meant no class for me. Even if there had been, I would have taken the day off for this. I wasn’t going to miss it. 



“This one here,” Jessica pointed it out. I pulled my grey car to a stop just outside the grungy warehouse. Its walls had been a tan color I think, though the paint was stained and peeling.



My eyes wandered towards the trash bins outside the entrance. The mound of bulging black garbage bags was wedging the rectangular lid open. Jessica must’ve noticed as I pursed my lips. “I know…” she said, “it’s kind of a sketchy area. We should head inside.” 



“Aren’t we a bit early?” I asked, craning my neck to get a look at the front entrance, “don’t see anyone else going in yet.” 



“Youry should be here,” she said, “I could tell he was a bit nervous about today.” 



“Yeah?” I asked. “Why’s that?”



“Just don’t want him to think nobody’s coming. And… you know that guy I told you about?” 



“The guy who lives at the studio?”



“Yeah,” she nodded, “he sometimes can be a bit… unpredictable.” 



“I’m sure it’ll be fine,” I told her, “you haven’t told me much about him, just that he gets really into character. Some people might even be interested to see that… don’t you think?”



“I guess we’ll see.” Jessica pushed open her car door and headed up towards the studio. I followed, giving her what I hoped to be a comforting smile as she pulled the doors open. 



I felt somewhat out of place standing in the front entranceway. Jessica went over to greet the other actors as I lingered at the doorway. A few people stood around me. An older couple walked over to introduce themselves. They told me about their grandson, who was playing the main role of the protagonist in the film. 



“You must be excited to see the studio as well then,” I said. “Have you visited it before?” 



“Nah,” the old man shook his head, “he’s told us barely anything. Studio secrecy and all that.” 



“Right,” his wife nodded, “very professional around here, I’d say. I’ve heard that about these things before. They want to keep everything a mystery.” 



I nodded, turning my focus to the sound of polished shoes approaching from the hallway ahead. His features were stern, but not unfriendly with an angular jaw. He was extremely thin, and dressed in a baggy grey suit. His mustache was well grown out, but flat as a comb against his lip. Jessica returned to me as a hush fell upon the assembled crowd.



“Welcome everyone,” said the man, waving. “I’m the director of the film, Youry Nowak. Glad all of you could make it out. If you follow me we’ll be off to the main stage.” He went over some basic rules, that we were not to touch anything and to watch our step when we entered the first set. 



I will say the interior of the studio was well kept compared to the exterior. As Youry led us down the hallway the tiled floor was extremely smooth. Portions marked with wet floor signs were even noticeably fresh with cleaning solutions. *Like they prepared it just for our visit.* 



Through a set of double doors my eyes widened. The set was reminiscent of an old English street. It was built of cobblestone with black lamp posts along the sidewalk. Off to the left hand side was the exterior of a building—which Youry referred to as the clocktower. It was enormous, tall enough that it touched the roof. We were told that it was only the bottom half of the tower. The upper half would be added in post. 



My eyes roamed the space as Youry talked on. The loose stone shifted beneath my feet as I turned around, taking it all in. I noticed some of the other guests wandering, a few kneeling down to get a closer look at some of the smaller details. Amongst it all, something stuck out to me, seemingly unnoticed by the others. Near the storm grate along the edge of the clocktower was a large stone platform. As I got closer I could see a wooden trapdoor on its face. As I got closer, I heard something that, I’ll admit, sent a shiver through my body. It was a hushed voice which oozed an aura of excitement. 



“I’ve found it,” theyranted with glee, “the voice, the movement. Thank you, Thank you for showing me. At last, It's all coming together.” I was now standing right above the trapdoor. There was a big gold star hastily nailed into the wood. 



“Excuse me…” said the director. Even at a distance, I could see the single drop of sweat dripping down his forehead. He approached me at a brisk pace. The trail of guests followed behind. “I was just about to show you all the next room. There’s a lot more to see…” 



Just as I stepped back down from the platform, there was a creek as the trapdoor swung open. I caught a glimpse of what seemed to be an ordinary room below. A bed with a white frame. Scattered pages of comic books… and something large and swollen I couldn’t quite make out. It was obstructed as the man climbed out, slamming the trap door shut behind him. The only skin exposed was the circle of his white face. Head to toe, he was dressed in grey with small round blue markers stuck all across it. 



“Oh hello…” the man glared at me, “you didn't see anything, did you?” He gestured down at the trapdoor. 



“N… no.” I stammered, shaking my head. 



The man flashed his teeth as he smiled, “good… well, I’m glad to see you all then, I’ve been locked in my room, for… I don't know how long. You recognize me don’t you?” 



His eyes fixed on each of us individually as he waited for an answer. The room remained completely silent. 



“I’m Andy Baker. No? Anyway, for this role they asked me to play a crazy man, a murderer who consumes his victims. All my acting is done in a motion capture suit—it’s a CGI character. I argued with them about it for a while. Practical effects would be better, I said, you know, with makeup. Not some modern generated character within a computer.... I’ve put everything into this role. To get into character I’ve gone so far as to…” 



“Very insightful…” Youry cut in, “thank you Andy.”  



Andy scowled. “I told you not to interrupt, remember?” he bit his grey thumb then pointed it at the director. “Or else I’ll do it again.” 



Youry went pale. “Not here.”  



I flinched as Andy’s eyes flashed towards me. “Isn’t that why you brought all these guests? Why not give them a show. 



“Andy please,” the director gulped, “no.”



“Fine then…”  Andy snarled, clenching his jaw. “Fade to black.” He then darted away on all fours. Like an animal he reached the side of the clocktower. We could still see his eyes as he crouched among the rubble. The sound of chewing followed.



“He does sell the part well doesn’t he?” Youry laughed after a pause. He began to clap. Following his example the rest of us joined in. I tried to meet Jessica’s gaze as I clapped along with the others, but she looked away quickly. 



“You alright?” I asked. She held my arm tightly as we followed Youry to the next set of double doors. She looked back towards the clocktower, making sure he was out of earshot before pulling me closer. In a hushed voice she told me Andy Baker wasn’t actually his name. It was his character’s name. The cannibal. 



“Oh I see…” I nodded, “what’s his real name then?” 



“I don’t even know, “ she shook her head, “I don’t think any of the cast does. He’s a serious method actor. At least… that’s what Youry told us the first day. He told us not to ask too many questions, just to go along with it.” 



Leaving the room, Youry led us down a narrow hallway to what he informed was the motion capture room. It was significantly smaller than the previous space. Above our heads was a ring of cameras facing down into the center of the room. 



A more friendly-looking actor was introduced, who explained how the technology worked. She told us that the tracking markers would be recorded by the cameras above us. This would translate to movement in 3d space and would be a starting point to animate the character. They then showed us some recordings on the monitor at the front of the room, and how it looked in the final render. 



Jessica had explained some of the process to me before, but I thought it was fascinating learning about it in person.



The tour ended back at the front entranceway. “Well, that about wraps things up,” Youry announced, “once again I wanted to thank you all for coming out. As for our actors I need you back on stage C in 5 minutes. Thanks.” The director barely paused to wave us off as he headed back the way we’d come. A muttering of chatter erupted all around me as guests began making their way out of the studio.



Jessica looked towards me. “Are you sure about picking me up after?” she asked. “It’s okay if you wanna head back to the apartment. I have my bus pass with me.” 



“I was thinking I’d spend the day in Vancouver, explore the city a bit”



“Alright, drive safe then,” Jessica gave my hand a squeeze, “I’ll give you a call when things finish up here.” She hurried off with the other actors, giving me a final wave before disappearing down the hall. 



\*



I found my car and climbed into the driver’s seat. I watched the other guests begin to leave, one by one, until it was just me alone in the parking lot. As I started the ignition I glanced over at the driver’s seat. There was Jessica’s phone. *How am I supposed to know when to come back if she doesn’t have it?* I wondered. *She must have forgotten it.*



Stepping out of the car I returned to the studio. There was a man dressed in black, holding the door open. A puff of smoke hazed in his breath. I could see the smoldering cigarette pinched between his fingers. 



Marching up to the front door, I nodded to the smoker. “Thanks man,” I said, heading through the open door. *Probably not supposed to be here,* I thought, *there should be someone who can give this to her though.* 



A few paces down the hall I paused. Looking back at the doorway, the smoker was nowhere to be seen. I wasn’t far from the main stage now, but I couldn’t hear any voices within. The studio itself was eerily quiet. I was very aware of my footsteps after that. The unavoidable wet squeaking followed as I walked over the wet floor.



I approached the large doors of the main stage. They had been left ajar. All the lights were off, leaving the room black as night. *There should be a light switch*, I remembered seeing one along the right wall. Stepping through the darkness I inched towards it. 



The hinges of the door behind me squealed as they swung shut. The hall light faded into a thin sliver across the floor. “Kill him?” a voice asked, “kill him you say?” I froze in place. I recognised him immediately. He was between me and the doorway. 



I held my right arm defensively out towards the voice. My other hand found the wall, and I began searching its surface. The first switch clicked when I pushed it down but seemed to do nothing. 



“If you ask, I will,” the voice continued. “Lure him down to the depths… and devour.” 



The hairs on the back of my neck bristled as I felt the breath of the last word against my skin. My thumb found another button which I immediately pressed. The lights of the set flashed into luminance. 



My eyes darted around, taking in the set once more. I was alone on an empty stage. 



I don’t know what it was that made me approach the trapdoor—*curiosity?* All I know is that when I saw the lid was open I couldn’t look away. *That thing down there,* I remembered it from earlier, the grey lump which rested on the edge of the bed. It was coated in crusty grime, fabric stained. *What the hell is he keeping down here?* I wondered. 



The rickety ladder creaked as I descended into the room. There was a crunch as my shoes found the wooden floor. *Glass,* I realized, *scattered around me.* It had come from a broken mirror laying on its side in the corner. I approached it, and found printed photos. Andy, I recognised, smiling in the first image. His eyes looked different, like there was a genuine friendliness there. He was also a bit larger compared to the second photo—which was presumably after he had lost some weight. *He looks even thinner now,* I thought, *I could see the outline of his ribs, even through the motion capture suit.* Kneeling, I touched a few of the pieces of glass lying nearby. I picked up a larger shard, shaped like a knife, and took it with me. 



Finally, I turned my full attention to the bulging bag that had caught my eye to begin with. Moving to the bed, I examined it more closely—it was large, with a slimy shine. I reached for the opening, thinking to have a look at whatever was inside. As I tugged at it, a wet glob of fluid began to ooze out. I wasn’t able to pull my hand away before I felt it drooling over my fingers. 



“Yes, I know it has to be raw,” I flinched when I heard his voice. I had thought the room was empty. “The deer gave them all a fright last time… but getting into character will take more. Raw animal meat hasn’t been enough.” The floorboards creaked as I stepped around the bed. This hidden lair didn’t end with just a bedroom. I spotted a handrail along the passage, leading deeper. 



The space below was wide open, a circular room. In the center I spotted a figure sitting in a large chair. Her wrists were tied to the armrests. Around her foot, a pool of dark fluid gleamed in flickering light.



“Jessica,”  I rushed forward as I realized it was her. I only made it a few steps before the whisper of his voice made me freeze once more. 



“In servitude, I have done it. Are you pleased?” There he was. I could see Andy, sitting at my girlfriend’s side. He looked like a rat, perched atop a large metal stool. He was gripping something in his long white fingers. It dripped as he took a bite, staining his knees and trickling to the floor. Jessica didn’t react as Andy spoke, dull eyes staring straight ahead. She wore a blank expression. 



“Am I to wait longer?” Andy asked, “or has the time to devour come. He was looking past Jessica… *to someone else?* I wondered. *No. If there is, I can’t see them.* 



It was faint, though I thought I heard a faint voice respond to him. “We only need her.”A shiver ran down my spine.



Andy turned his head to stare directly toward me. “The brotherhood warned me of you,” he smiled, “that I might have company during my rehearsal. Do you want to hear more...?” 



“What the hell did you do to her?” I demanded. I noticed there was a saw blade stashed under the actor’s shadow. She was in her grey socks. The sawed fabric stuck up oddly around the severed portion. My stomach turned as my mind connected the visuals. He chuckled as he chewed on it. 



“Is that a no?” Andy raised an eyebrow, “I insist, come closer,” he beckoned me. “Let me show you what it is I’ve been working on!” I moved forward, gripping the glass shard behind my back like a blade, I drew it and cut the restraint holding her right arm. “Stop it,” Andy’s smile twitched. I barely managed to pull the rope loose before he lunged at me. 



His attack was a blur of teeth and nails. I yelled as pain erupted in my neck and shoulder. My arm instinctively landed against his upper chest, pushing away his bloody teeth. I threw him off of me and backed away. He charged once more, diving into me. The air wheezed from my lungs as my back struck the hard floor. My vision blurred. The world was broken into raw shapes as I struggled to regain control. His body was a grey smudge. A white face that gleamed in the eclectic light above. 



Glass in hand, I drew back my arm then stabbed him. My vision refocused in time to catch the look of agony across the man’s face. His eyes clenched shut as it contorted. The glass had embedded itself in his back—in the soft skin under his left shoulder blade.  



He howled, stumbling backwards. I took the chance to return to Jessica’s side and cut through the second restraint. I grabbed her shoulders and pulled her upright. “Go!” I told her frantically. She shook her head, blinking slowly at me as if waking from some hex. Her legs wobbled as I nudged her towards the stairs. I followed behind her, putting myself between her and Andy. 



I could see the trapdoor had remained untouched as we entered the bedroom area. “Go,” I told Jessica. Grabbing under her arms, I helped lift her up so she could crawl through the exit. The crunching of rubble followed as she disappeared from view. I flinched as there came an ear-piercing scream somewhere above—not from Jessica. 



I grabbed hold of the ladder. Andy appeared at the stairwell as I began to climb; there was fury in his eyes. He charged at me. “Get away,” I shouted. His fingernails were like thorns as they bit into my lower leg. I kicked at him, and my foot found his jaw. He fell back, giving me enough time to clamber up the rest of the ladder.  



I emerged onto the set and found myself under the gaze of several stage lights. I blinked, covering my brow, as faces from the edges of the set watched in confusion. 



“Jessica,” I rushed to her side. All eyes were on her and her bloody foot. A small pool had already formed, leaking between her fingers that were clamped around it. Her face was contorted in a silent scream. 



*I need to get her out of here,* I thought. I pulled her upright, supporting her weight as we hobbled to the doors. 



Looks of terror were plastered on the faces of the film crew as we passed them by. “She left midway through the second half of the shoot,” the director stammered. He moved into our path. “Everyone was looking for her. And then when we couldn’t find Andy as well…”



“Out of the way,” I pushed past Youry as we turned down the hallway. 



Jessica had been mumbling since I’d gotten her out of that chair. Whatever trance she had been under had only partially faded. She reacted as if there were demons in the walls, flinching frequently and holding tight to me. It only got worse as we stepped out into the parking lot. “We’re not going to make it,” she screamed, burying her face in my arm. 



“We will,” I told her, looking around for the unseen horror, “there’s nothing following us.” We’re gonna get you help.



I pulled open the car door then gently helped Jessica sit. The wound on her foot looked uneven from the saw blade. The entire foot was drenched in blood. I took off my shirt and wrapped it around the wound in a tight knot. I could see the stumps of the missing toes wiggling beneath the fabric, as red stains formed. 



She seemed to have calmed a bit as I climbed into the driver’s seat and started the engine. She was breathing heavily in and out through her nose. It was difficult for me to see that pain in her eyes as her skin continued to quiver. I pulled out of the parking lot and through the front gate. Speeding down the road, I wanted to put as much distance between us and the studio as possible.



\*



Writing this all out has been therapeutic for me. I’m still processing everything that’s happened, and questioning. Of course I stayed with her overnight at the hospital. Since we’ve left the studio I’ve felt a presence hanging over us. It’s been strong enough that I haven’t dared sleep. I’m exhausted. The main question in my mind is what is this presence? Andy? Or whatever he was speaking to down in the cellar. 



Jessica’s hysteria continued when we first arrived. “They’re following.” she cried as her eyes darted around wildly. “Not my friends, couldn’t stop them.” The nurses hushed her as they led us to a private room to care for her injured foot. The doctors asked me if she had a history of hallucinations. 



I don’t think that’s true—that it’s all in her head. At one point last night she woke up suddenly. “They won’t stop,” she said softly, “the voices.” 



“What are they saying?” I was startled by the look in her eyes. Something about them seemed different… it wasn’t terror anymore. More like hunger.



“This voice, it’s so faint,” she whispered as she stared at me. Once more, I peered deep into her eyes, searching. They had an unfamiliar dullness to them. Grey streaks around the edges. “I can’t make out the words yet,” she told me, “but I can’t help but listen.”
