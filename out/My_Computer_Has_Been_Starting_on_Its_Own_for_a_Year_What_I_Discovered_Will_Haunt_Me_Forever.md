Since the time I bought my PC in March of last year, it’s had this unnerving habit: it starts on its own while I’m asleep. At first, I thought it was just a glitch—maybe a faulty setting or a random power surge. But as the months went by, the pattern became too regular to ignore.

It started subtly. I’d hear the soft hum of the PC in the dead of night, only to find the screen glowing faintly when I checked. The first few times, I brushed it off as a minor malfunction. Perhaps it was a software update or an automatic restart gone wrong. But the occurrences kept happening—always on Monday and Friday at exactly midnight.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to keep a log. Each Monday and Friday, precisely at midnight, my PC would turn on. No matter what I did—unplugging all cables, removing the battery, or even powering down the entire system—it still happened. It was as if the computer had a mind of its own.

Determined to get to the bottom of this, I decided to stay awake and watch what happened. The first time I did, it terrified me. When the clock struck 12:00 AM, the screen flickered to life, casting an eerie glow in my dark room. The screen displayed cryptic, pulsating symbols—completely foreign to me. Just as I tried to make sense of them, the screen went black. 

Then, a video file began playing. The video showed a series of random dates flashing on the screen. Each date appeared for only a few seconds before the next replaced it. It seemed meaningless, but there was something unsettling about the rapid sequence of numbers. The video ended with the most disturbing sound I’ve ever heard in my life—a scream, guttural and raw. I couldn’t tell if it was human or something far more terrifying. The sound reverberated in my head, keeping me awake the entire night. 

The PC shut off abruptly after the scream, plunging my room into silence and darkness. As I sat there, trembling, I couldn't stop questioning how any of this was possible. But no matter how I tried to rationalize it, I knew deep down that this was far more sinister than anything I had ever encountered in my 20 years of life.

I’m not gonna lie—at that point, I seriously thought about throwing the PC out of the window. But curiosity got the better of me. I decided to investigate further. 

So the next Friday, I armed myself with a notebook, determined to take notes on everything I saw. Again, at midnight, the PC flickered on as if possessed, displaying the same cryptic symbols. This time, I paid close attention. One of the symbols was a straight line, another resembled a backward letter "C," and there were two dots next to each other.

Then came the dates again, just like last time. But now, I wrote them down carefully: 10/06, 11/01, 09/09, 10/07, 09/07, 11/05, 11/06, and 09/07. What could these dates mean? I had no idea. But the repeating scream that followed—just as terrifying as before—made me wonder if I was unraveling something I wasn’t meant to know...
