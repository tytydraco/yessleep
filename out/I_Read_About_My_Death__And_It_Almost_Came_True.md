I don’t believe in superstitions. At least I didn’t—until I read about my own death.

I came home after four long years in the U.S., finishing my master’s degree. My family lives in a small, remote town in India—the kind of place where you’ll see more cows than cars. The transition from city life to this quiet, almost timeless village was jarring. Everything was slower, simpler, but also… quieter. Too quiet, sometimes. My parents tried to make me comfortable, but it wasn’t easy.

My father is respected in the village—not just for his wealth, but for his influence. I never cared about the wealth, never flaunted it, but people treated me with a mixture of fear and respect.

I had noticed this behavior before but never thought much about it. It was only after coming back, seeing it again with a city mind, that the unease began to creep in.

When I asked my mother about it, she sighed and told me,“Because of your grandmother. She has… powers. On certain days, during the festival, she channels the deity and addresses the villagers’ concerns. People obey her.”

I laughed. Possession, powers, ritualistic influence—I brushed it off as old-world superstition.

Then she added something subtle. “You could come to the temple with us,” she said, almost an invitation, almost casual. “It’s… better if you’re there.”

I shook my head politely. I didn’t want to go. I had no interest in temple rituals or village crowds.

Her voice hardened just slightly. “Then at least stay inside. Don’t interact with anyone on the day of the festival. Just stay inside.”

I nodded, hiding my curiosity behind indifference. But the warning lingered in my mind. It made me wonder why she felt the need to insist.

The festival day arrived. September rain and sunlight flickering behind grey clouds—a deceptive calm. The whole street smelled of wet earth and fresh flowers from the temple. My parents left for the temple, leaving me behind in the house.

Before leaving, my grandmother handed me a small pouch. Inside was turmeric.“Keep this close to you,” she said. Her fingers were cold but firm. “No matter what.”

I didn’t think much of it. I slipped it into my pocket and went back to my room.

The morning passed in routine distractions. I played PS5, watched gameplays and streams, and lost myself in the familiar hum of digital worlds. Occasionally, the pouch slipped from my pocket. I placed it carefully on the table, almost forgetting it entirely.

Then came the first strange thing. A loud crash outside my window. My heart jumped. I ran over, expecting a branch, a stray animal, something simple. But the glass was shattered. No brick, no stone. Nothing in sight. I shut the window calmly, collected the shards, and tried to shrug it off. My mind insisted on logic, but a subtle unease began to seep in.

Through the broken window, I saw them—children, laughing, jumping, building paper boats with pages torn from old newspapers. The rain soaked them, plastered hair to their foreheads, but their joy was pure and unrestrained. Something in me stirred. A memory of childhood, of playing in puddles, of simple delight. I couldn’t resist.

I grabbed an umbrella and went out to join them. The children squealed at my sudden appearance, pointing and laughing as I fumbled with the newspaper. I copied their movements, folding the pages into boats and letting them float into the puddles along the road. Their laughter was infectious, pulling something long-buried out of me, a memory of childhood I hadn’t realized I missed.

The villagers looked on from afar but quickly turned away. Their faces held quiet, subtle awareness—not anger, not direct fear, not pity—but a glance that felt like they knew something I didn’t. It was disconcerting, yet I continued.

When I tore the next page, I froze. It was an obituary section. My eyes scanned the page lazily—until they stopped.

The photograph.

It was me.

I blinked hard. Once. Twice. My own name didn’t go away. Neither did my face.

Same face. Same name. The date of death—today.

For a moment, my world narrowed to that single piece of paper. Rain blurred the ink. The laughter around me faded, one sound at a time—the giggles first, then the splashes, then the whisper of wind itself.

All that remained was the drum of my heartbeat.

When I finally looked up, the bus stop was empty. The road was empty. Even the village itself seemed to be holding its breath.

A faint ringing filled my ears, the kind that comes after a loud sound—except there had been none.

Panic set in, heavy and physical. I clutched the newspaper, shoved it into my pocket, and ran.

The rain felt heavier now, the ground slick beneath my feet. My breaths came out short and ragged as I reached the house, pushing the door open with trembling hands.

As I bolted up the stairs, I thought—absurdly—that I’d made it, that I was safe. But the instant my foot hit the landing, something sliced deep into my heel.

A shard of glass.

I crashed to the floor, clutching my leg. The pain was immediate and blinding. Blood pooled fast, dark and sticky. I stared in disbelief—hadn’t I cleared all the shards? I had. I remembered sweeping every inch of that floor.

But this one—this large, jagged piece—was gleaming right where I’d stepped.

I crawled, dragging myself toward my room, half-hopping, half-pulling, leaving smears of red along the floorboards. I slammed the door shut behind me and slumped against it, heart pounding in my ears.

The pain blurred everything, but my gaze locked on the table. The pouch.

I don’t know what made me reach for it. I tore it open. Turmeric spilled out in a golden cloud. My hands shook as I pressed it against the wound. The sting was unbearable, but I kept going until the bleeding slowed.

I felt weak, trembling, and the urge to run to the kitchen to treat myself properly gnawed at me—but fear held me in place. I tried to stand and reach for my phone, but my leg refused to cooperate. My body felt heavy and tired, every movement an effort.

Then it was all a blur. The distant roar of our family car pulling into the driveway. Hands lifting me into the back seat. Sirens, flashing lights, the sterile chaos of the emergency ward. Pain, exhaustion, confusion. Darkness.

When I came to, I was bandaged, lying in a hospital bed. The newspaper in my pocket—the one that had shaken me to the core—was gone. I couldn’t find it, no matter how hard I searched. It was as if it had never existed.

I don’t know what was real. The children, the street, the obituary, the shard of glass, the turmeric—was it all a warning? A vision? A trick of the mind?

I only know this: I cannot leave my home until I find that newspaper page, until I know what it meant.

Until then, I stay inside. Locked doors, cautious steps, the world reduced to my room, my thoughts, and the lingering, inexplicable terror of that day.

Superstition or not, I am not foolish enough to challenge *death* again.
