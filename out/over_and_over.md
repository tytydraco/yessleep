So, there was this girl, right? Not the kind you write songs about or whatever. People didn’t notice her. I mean, I barely noticed her at first, but then I couldn’t stop noticing her, you know? She smelled like burning wood. Like... like if a campfire was a person. Weird, right? But not in a bad way.

She moved here last spring. Said she was “just passing through.” A lot of people are. This town’s good for that. It’s got, like, 854 people, and I swear 70% are already halfway out the door. Not that I’m counting or anything.

The first time I saw her, she was sitting outside the diner, eating cherry pie out of a tin with her fingers. And yeah, that doesn’t sound weird at first, but the diner doesn’t even serve pie in a tin. So where’d she get it? That was my first what the hell? moment.

“Want some?” she asked, catching me staring.

I froze. Was she serious? Was she messing with me? I spent way too long trying to figure it out, so eventually I just nodded like an idiot.

“Uh, yeah,” I said, but my voice cracked at the end. Like, actually cracked. Great first impression, right?

I sat down next to her. Super weird move, but I did it anyway. You’re probably thinking it was one of those cool, movie moments where the guy sits down and says something clever. Nope. It was awkward as hell.

“You want a fork?” she asked, looking at me like I’d just ordered off her menu or something.

I shook my head. “Nope.” I didn’t even like pie, but what was I supposed to do? Say no? That felt worse somehow.

She grinned at me, but not in a nice way. More like, You’re an idiot, and I know it. Then she said, “Good, ‘cause I wasn’t getting you one,” and I laughed. Like, an actual laugh. It wasn’t even funny, but there I was, laughing while she just kept smirking.

We sat there, eating pie with our fingers, not saying much. People walked by and glanced at us, but no one stopped. That’s the thing about this town, people are polite, but only in the way they’re supposed to be. They’ll smile, wave, keep walking, but it’s not real. Not really.

“You live here?” I asked eventually, just to break the silence.

“Sometimes,” she said, wiping her fingers on her jeans.

“What does that even mean?”

She didn’t answer. Just stood up, brushed off her hands, and walked away like the conversation was over.

I sat there for a while, staring at the tin she left behind. Was I supposed to throw it away? Take it? Leaving it felt wrong, but taking it felt weirder. Eventually, I threw it in the trash and walked home, feeling like the biggest idiot on the planet.



The next day was... fine, I guess. Breakfast, school, lunch, the usual. Except it didn’t feel fine. The radio played the same old country songs, but the static between them dragged on, like it was trying to say something. My mom wasn’t home, that's not weird, she usually isn’t, but the house felt quieter than usual.

At school, people waved and asked the same questions they always do. “How’s your mom?” “How’s school?” It’s all surface-level stuff, and honestly, it makes me feel lonelier than if they just ignored me.

Mrs. Lambert spent history class droning on about the Civil War. I wasn’t listening, though. My brain kept circling back to the girl. The pie tin. The way she walked off without saying goodbye, like it didn’t matter if I followed her or not.

By the end of the day, I found myself wandering back to the diner. Not on purpose or anything. At least, that’s what I told myself.

She was there again. Same spot. Same tin of pie.

“You always hang out here?” I asked, trying to sound casual.

“Sometimes,” she said, taking a bite.

“Where do you even get that?”

She shrugged. “You want some?”

I sat down before I even thought about it. This time, I didn’t hesitate when she offered the pie. We sat there, eating in silence again. It was weird, but not bad.

“You never answered my question,” I said eventually.

“Which one?”

“Do you live here?”

She smirked, like I was the punchline to a joke she wasn’t going to explain. “Depends on the day.”

And just like before, she stood up, brushed herself off, and walked away, leaving me with the empty tin and way too many questions.

One day, she took me to the woods. We were walking past the arcade when she stopped, turned to me, and said, “Come on.”

“Where?” I asked, but she didn’t answer.

We ended up at this old trailer. It looked like it had been abandoned for years, with rust crawling up the sides and windows covered in cardboard. She stared at it for a long time, like it was home.

“You live here?” I asked, trying not to sound like a jerk.

“Sometimes,” she said, her voice flat.

“Sometimes” again. Always sometimes.

When she walked off into the woods, I followed her because, honestly, what else was I gonna do?



Later, we were sitting on the curb again, sharing pie like always. She was quiet for a long time, and then she looked at me.

“You ever think it’s weird?” she asked.

“What’s weird?”

“This place. The town. Everything.”

I shrugged. “I mean, it’s small. Quiet. Kind of boring.”

“No,” she said, her voice sharper than usual. “Not boring. *Wrong.* Haven’t you noticed?”

I opened my mouth to argue, but nothing came out.

“The fridge,” she said. “It’s always full, but no one ever brings groceries. Your mom’s never home, but she’s never *not* home either. And the school year, it’s been September forever.”

“That’s not--”

“True?” she interrupted. “Really? And the pie, it’s the same pie every day. No one makes it. It’s just *there.*”

She stood up, brushing crumbs off her jeans. “This place isn’t real, Eli. None of it is.”

She walked away, leaving me sitting there with the tin in my lap and my head spinning.



So, there was this girl, right?

Not the kind you write songs about.

But the kind you don’t forget.
