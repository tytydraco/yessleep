I have never actually posted anything here and to be fair I can’t take credits for this story since it was never mine. I guess in due time you might understand why, but I am a true believer that any good story should be shared, and this one always seemed to have an effect on people, so let’s get right to it.

During the summer of 2009 (December and January since I live in Brazil) I was once again working as a camp monitor.I was already quite familiar with the camp since I had worked there before and had built a great relationship with the rest of the staff (from the cooks to the bus drivers). I myself had never attended the camp, but I guess it’s just a cultural thing (I heard in some places it’s common for former camp members to work there). Anyway, just so you have a basic understanding of how the camp used to work, we used to get from 40 to 200 kids at once over different periods of time (full weeks, day trips, weekends, and any other plan that they had scheduled). Being a monitor meant that we would make sure they went through the planned activities, went to bed on time, had their meals, and were safe at all times. Nothing too special, you might have to tell one kid off here and there but it was mostly a look lively kind of job. And this is where I found this story. Because as you remember, this story is not mine, I was just there to hear it and now I will share it with you.

During a weekend stayover, meaning that the kids would be dropped off on a Friday and picked up on a Sunday, we were going through the motions as usual. We had our breakfast with the kids, took them on the usual trail and went back for lunch with the other staff members. One said member was Carlão, which would be equivalent to “Big Carlos” in English, he was the absolute best. An older bus driver that just made everyone feel welcome. Do you know that person that just lights up a room when they are around? Kind of loud and boisterous, but just so affectionate. Well, that was him. His booming voice would bring all kinds of joy to our meals and each silly anecdote he told would have us bursting in tears. He was in his late forties, or I presume (never stopped to have a one to one kind of conversation with him), and felt like that natural father/ uncle figure with the chubbiness to match. Well, Carlão was there as usual and we had an absolute blast, as expected during our lunch with him. He commanded that table expertly and before we knew it we were off to finish the rest of the day with the kids.

Since this was an over the weekend stay with the kids, we would cram as much as possible into as few hours to give them the “fullest” experience, which meant I would work my ass off until the dead of night (the night time games were actually quite fun to be fair). That also meant that I did not see Carlão or any of the other bus drivers leave after dinner and I would only see them when they returned on Sunday. The weekend proceeded as per usual, without any major incidents, except for a few scraped knees and some minor tears (all in a day's work I guess). Come Sunday, we all go down to have lunch looking forward to the staff football match (soccer I guess for some) we get to play just before the kids are about to leave. When we arrive at our usual table, I see Carlão is visibly off. I mean, he is just not himself, distant, cold and completely removed from the whole conversation. We try getting him to participate, but he is not having it, he just won’t budge, until we finally ask “What the hell is going on? You are just not yourself today. Something must be up, come on, tell us.” He gives this big sigh and finally breaks his silence, “Look, something happened but I don’t think you guys will believe it. I don’t.” But now that we have him talking we are not backing down and we press on, “Come on. Try us. We promise that we won’t judge. How bad can it be?”. We continued pressing until he eventually caved and this is what he told us (I’ll try to make it as close as possible, but I can’t truly state that it is verbatim): Here is what he said:

On Friday, after dinner, I packed my things and headed back to the bus to take it back to the garage as I always do. I got into the bus as usual, set it in gear and left the camp. I had barely turned the corner when after I checked my side mirror I thought I saw what looked like an arm resting out of the back window of the bus. It was just a quick glimpse and the poorly illuminated roads didn’t really help but I was almost certain that it was an arm. At first I thought “Some kid must have hopped on the bus because they wanted to go home and now I have to deal with this.”. I stopped the bus and went up the passengers seats expecting to find some child looking a mix of guilty and frightened, but it was empty. I went through the rows of seats and nothing. It must have been part of my imagination, I’m tired and I’ve been working non stop.I just need to make it to the garage and go home to get some rest, it has been a long day. I decided that it would be best to just ignore it and have a laugh about it some other time. 

I continued on my way, but the eeriness of what I saw didn’t leave me and going down those dark dirt roads did not help at all. I kept looking in my mirror but I couldn’t see a thing, until I was about to reach the main road. Before merging I looked into my side mirror again and there it was, an arm resting out the window right at the back of the bus as if someone was just enjoying the ride. That was it, it was clear as day. I stopped the bus and went back into the passenger’s seat. Ok, I know you are in there, you can get out, I shouted. But nothing happened. I turned the lights on and started looking below the seats, in the luggage compartments, inside the bathroom, but nothing. No one there. I know what I saw and now I was starting to freak out. I still had to drive another hour and a half and that feeling of something wrong started to seep in. A feeling of I was not alone, but I still had to drive back. Against my will I forced myself into the driver’s seat and continued on. I went from the main road to the highway without a hitch, that was, until I got to the roundabout. While leaving the roundabout I had to check my side mirror and I saw the arm again, just laying there at the back of the bus. 

That was it. I decided to stop the bus at the next gas station. When I got there I asked the clerk to help me. He stood by the door, everything was lit and I COMBED that bus. I went over every little nook and cranny, I checked under the seats, over the compartments, inside the toilet but it was absolutely empty. I thanked the man and went on my way, but now my lights were on and my door was closed (I am not supposed to drive with lights on at night but I just didn’t care). To keep me company I called my wife and we started speaking over the speaker. I told her what had happened and she suggested we change the subject. The conversation helped me to calm my nerves, but it was short lived because I reached the hilly portion of the highway back to São Paulo it all changed. It was riddled with curves and my cellphone was out of signal. Now I had no option but to focus on the road. 

Left, right, left, right, the windy road continued on and on, until I had to shift lanes. I looked to my side mirror and there it was again, the arm. But now it was not at the back of the bus, it was a few windows back. That was it. I was not looking at that mirror until I had parked the bus safe and sound at the garage. I kept my eyes focused on the road and continued on my way. With an unshakable feeling that someone or something was right behind me, I kept at it despite every single bone of my body telling me to stop. It wasn’t far now. I reached the main freeway of São Paulo and I had just one more turn before I reached the bus station. When I was about to turn, I couldn't help but look into my side mirror and seeing the arm, but now it was not a few windows back, instead it was in the window right behind mine. A chill ran down my spine and a sense of dread took over me. 

I was on full auto and focused on the last few metres to the garage, but the light right before the garage had just turned red. While contemplating if I ran that light or not, I heard a knock right behind me. I froze in place. The sound of my heartbeat was all I could hear above the gentle hum of the engine. The door behind me opened but I didn’t dare glance back. A hand rested on my shoulder and I could make the silhouette of a man carrying a suitcase right next to me. In a deep smooth voice he said “Friend, this is my stop. May I get out please?”. “O- of course.” I managed to mutter back. I pushed the button for the door to open, and heard as he slowly climbed out of the bus. From the corner of my eye I could barely make out the man who stood with one foot on the bus and another on the sidewalk. He turned his head towards me, but his head covered most of his face, and said “You know, you should stop working the bus this late at night. You never know what you might find and accidents happen all the time. Have a nice night.” All I could manage was a weak and feeble “Thank you.” And as I said it he stepped off the bus. Lifelessly, I drove the bus back to the garage and barely had the energy to make it home. I called my wife and kept looking over my shoulder at every single turn. But that is when I decided my time driving the bus at night was over.

Having heard that, we all looked at each other incredulously and started chuckling nervously. “You are kidding, right Carlão?”. He didn’t even smile back when he said “As I said, you believe what you want to believe, but that is it for me. I’m quitting.”. We heard it, but we couldn’t believe. He left that day saying goodbye to everyone, but we still had a feeling that we would be seeing him the next week. Come next week and lo and behold Carlão w/as not there. We did not hear from him, or see him ever since. From what we could gather was that he had truly quit his job to try something else. The debate if it was an elaborate prank done by him or not continued, but one thing was for sure, we now had a new campfire story to tell the kids.
