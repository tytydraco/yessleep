For obvious reasons I cannot share how I came across the contents of this diary as it's part of a cold case of an American couple and their daughter going missing in Sweden in the early nineties.

**October 21st**  
*Rättvik, Sweden*

We’ve made it. After what felt like an endless journey through winding roads and thick forests, we’ve finally arrived at the cabin. It’s small and unassuming, nestled by the riverbank, with trees that seem to guard it on all sides. Maria is already in love with the place—she was smiling the entire drive here, pointing out the colors of the leaves as they changed from green to deep golds and reds. Even Ashley was calm, which is more than we could have hoped for after such a long trip. She’s sleeping peacefully now, wrapped up tight in her blanket. For once, the stillness feels welcome.

The air is crisp, cooler than I expected for late autumn, but refreshing. There’s a certain charm to the Swedish countryside. It’s so unlike home, with its quiet calm, the way everything feels suspended in time. The river beside the cabin moves lazily, its surface barely disturbed, and the surrounding forest is still—almost too still—but I like it. There’s a sense of peace here, far away from the noise and clutter of our usual lives.

I stood outside for a while, listening. No sounds of cars, no distant hum of city life. Just the occasional rustle of leaves and the gentle rush of the river. It’s strange, in a way—coming from a world where we’re always surrounded by noise, this silence feels almost alive, like it’s waiting for something. Not in a bad way, just… expectant. I can’t quite explain it. Maybe it’s the novelty of being somewhere so remote. I can tell it’s going to take some getting used to.

The town itself is charming, though small—almost quaint. The people are friendly enough, though I could sense a certain curiosity from them when we told them where we were staying. The man at the general store mentioned the river, and told us it has a long history. He spoke with a kind of pride about it, saying it’s been here longer than time itself. I asked him if people swim in it, but he just gave me a smile and shook his head. Something about the water being too cold, even in summer.

Tomorrow, we’ll take a walk along the riverbank. Maria’s already planning on taking some pictures, capturing the autumn colors before they fade. I’m looking forward to seeing more of this place. There’s something about the way the river winds through the forest, the way the trees lean toward it, almost as if they’re drawn to the water.

I think we’re going to enjoy it here. It feels like the perfect escape from everything back home, a chance to breathe. I can’t help but feel a quiet sense of excitement, like there’s something just waiting to be discovered out here, something we couldn’t find anywhere else.

But for now, I’m content to sit by the window, watch the last of the daylight fade over the trees, and enjoy the quiet. There’s enough time to explore tomorrow.

**October 22nd**  
*Rättvik, Sweden*

Our first full day here, and I’m starting to feel a little more settled in. We spent the morning walking along the river, just as I planned. The forest feels even larger when you’re walking through it—endless, really. The trees are ancient, their trunks twisted and gnarled like something out of a storybook. Maria couldn’t stop taking pictures. She’s so happy here, more relaxed than I’ve seen her in months. It feels good to see her like this again, smiling so much. Ashley, of course, continues to sleep through everything, wrapped in her little cocoon of warmth.

The river is beautiful, more than I realized yesterday. The water is dark, but clear, with an almost glassy surface that reflects the trees and sky above. There’s something hypnotic about the way it moves, slowly, as if it’s carrying secrets from somewhere far beyond the horizon. I found myself staring at it longer than I meant to, watching the current ripple over rocks and branches beneath the surface. There’s a quiet rhythm to it, something peaceful. Maria laughed at me—said I looked lost in thought, but I wasn’t really thinking of anything in particular. Just listening to the water, I suppose.

We walked a little further upstream and found an old wooden bridge, probably centuries old. It’s worn down, covered in moss and damp from the mist that seems to settle over everything here. There’s something timeless about this place, like it exists in its own world, untouched by the passage of time. 

The locals don’t seem to visit this part of the river much, though. When we went back into town to pick up a few supplies, I asked the woman at the bakery about the bridge, whether people go there often. She didn’t answer right away, just gave me this look, almost like she was trying to decide whether or not to tell me something. In the end, all she said was, “It’s not a place we go often.” She didn’t elaborate, and I didn’t press her on it, but the way she said it stuck with me.

It’s strange. The people here are kind, but there’s a certain reticence in the way they talk about the area near the cabin. I don’t know if it’s just local superstition or something else, but it’s clear there’s something they don’t like to talk about. Still, I’m not too concerned. There’s probably some old folktale or legend about the river that they’ve grown up with—small towns always have stories like that.

Despite the chilly weather, I feel good about being here. There’s a kind of quiet I’m not used to, but I think I’m beginning to appreciate it. It’s not the kind of silence that feels oppressive, just… different. Maybe I’ve needed this. We’ve all needed this, after the stress of the last year. I’m sure Maria would agree.

I spent some time by the river again this evening, after Ashley went down for the night. The moon was just coming up, casting this soft light over the water. I thought I heard something—faint, like the sound of music or maybe singing—just under the noise of the river. I tried to listen for it again, but it was gone. Maybe it was just the wind playing tricks on me. The way it moves through the trees here, it can sound like anything.

I think I’ll go back tomorrow morning, maybe sit by the bank and read for a while. There’s something about that spot near the bridge that draws me in.

**October 23rd**  
*Rättvik, Sweden*

Last night was… strange. I can’t quite shake the feeling something was off, though nothing happened that I can put my finger on. Maria and I turned in early. It’s so dark here at night—without the glow of the city, the blackness outside is almost complete, broken only by the soft glimmer of moonlight on the river. Normally, I sleep well in the dark, but last night felt different. Heavy. Like the shadows were pressing in around the cabin.

I must’ve dozed off pretty quickly, but I woke up around 2 a.m. to find Maria sitting up in bed, just staring out the window. At first, I thought she was awake, but when I asked her if something was wrong, she didn’t respond—didn’t even turn to look at me. Her eyes were fixed on the river outside, wide open but distant. It wasn’t until I touched her shoulder that she finally blinked, shook her head, and looked at me like she had no idea how she got there.

She didn’t remember waking up at all. In fact, she seemed startled that she was even sitting up. I asked if she had a bad dream, but she just shrugged it off, said she probably had one of those half-asleep moments where you don’t realize what you’re doing. We laughed it off at the time—tired nerves, maybe. But now, thinking back on it this morning, I can’t shake how strange it felt.

After she lay back down, I stayed awake for a while, listening to the quiet. The cabin creaks a lot at night, the way old wooden buildings do, but there was something else—a faint sound, almost like someone humming just beneath the noise of the river. I thought maybe it was Maria humming in her sleep, but when I checked on her, she was sound asleep.

I didn’t hear it again after that, but I couldn’t fall back asleep for hours. Kept glancing over at the window, half-expecting to see something out there by the river, but of course, it was just the same as always. Dark water flowing through the trees, the moon reflecting off the surface. Nothing unusual. Just my mind playing tricks on me, I guess.

This morning, Maria doesn’t remember any of it. She seems fine—rested, even. Maybe I’m overthinking things. After all, it’s only been a couple of days since we arrived. It’s probably just the newness of the place, the unfamiliarity of the silence getting to me.

Still, there’s something about the way she was looking out at the river. Like she was listening to something… or waiting for something. I don’t know. I’m probably letting my imagination get carried away. It’s not like her to sleepwalk or anything like that, so I’m sure it was just a one-time thing.

I didn’t mention it to her again this morning. No point in worrying her over something so small. But I think I’ll keep an eye on her tonight, just in case.

The weather’s a bit cooler today, and the sky is overcast. I’ll spend the day by the river again—there’s something calming about it, even with everything else on my mind. Maybe I’ll take Ashley for a walk with me later, see if the fresh air settles me down.

-Tom

**October 24th**  
*Rättvik, Sweden*

The day started out as one of the better ones we’ve had so far. Maria suggested we take a short trip into the woods, explore more of the area around the cabin. The weather wasn’t great—still overcast and chilly—but it felt right. A perfect autumn day to wrap ourselves in coats and scarves, with Ashley bundled up close against Maria in her carrier, looking like a tiny explorer ready for an adventure.

We stopped in town first to pick up a few things. I’ve had the idea of trying my hand at fishing ever since we arrived, and today I finally made good on it. The man at the general store sold us a couple of simple rods and some basic tackle. I’m no expert, but it seems like the kind of place where you could drop a line in and just sit by the water for hours. There’s something about the river—it pulls at me, like it’s constantly calling me back to it.

The man who sold us the rods didn’t say much, just raised an eyebrow when I told him where we were staying, near the river. “Not many fish there,” he said in a low voice, “but maybe you’ll have some luck.” I didn’t ask what he meant by that, but I could tell by the look in his eyes there was something more he wasn’t saying. Everyone in this town seems to have that same guarded look whenever I mention the river.

Anyway, after we got the gear, we ventured into the woods. There’s a small path that leads from the cabin deeper into the forest. The trees are dense, tall pines that seem to stretch up forever, and the ground is covered in a thick layer of fallen leaves. It’s beautiful, really, in that stark, quiet way that only a northern forest can be. Maria took some more photos while Ashley napped peacefully on her chest. Everything felt perfect.

But as we walked, something strange happened. I heard the sound of hooves. At first, it was faint, almost like the distant thud of something running far off in the woods, but then it grew louder, sharper, as if a horse was galloping through the trees right beside us. I stopped dead in my tracks and listened, my heart suddenly racing. Maria didn’t seem to notice it—she kept walking a few steps ahead, humming softly to Ashley, unaware of the sound.

I looked around, expecting to see a horse burst through the trees, but there was nothing. Just the endless stretch of forest, the soft rustle of leaves in the breeze, and that sound. The pounding of hooves, impossibly close and yet, somehow, distant at the same time. Like it was there, but not. Real, but… not quite.

I called out to Maria, asked her if she heard it, but she just gave me a puzzled look and shook her head. She didn’t hear a thing.

The noise stopped just as quickly as it had started, fading away as though it had never been there at all. I tried to shake it off, telling myself it must’ve been my imagination. The woods can play tricks on your senses, especially when it’s as quiet and empty as this place is. But there was something about it—something I can’t explain. It wasn’t just a sound. It felt like a presence. Like something was there, watching, just out of sight.

We didn’t stay in the woods much longer after that. I didn’t tell Maria why I was eager to leave, only that we should head back so we could try out the new fishing gear. I’m not sure she would’ve understood anyway. She seems so content here, and I don’t want to ruin that. Maybe I’m the one being paranoid, hearing things that aren’t really there.

Back at the river, I tried my hand at fishing for a couple of hours. Didn’t catch anything, of course. The water was still and dark, like glass reflecting the gray sky. Every now and then, I thought I saw something moving beneath the surface—just a flicker, a shadow. But it’s probably just the light playing tricks on me. The locals were right: there doesn’t seem to be much life in the river, at least not that I can see.

Maria and Ashley watched from the bank, Maria laughing when I lost another bait to the rocks under the water. For a moment, everything felt normal again. Just a family enjoying a peaceful day by the water. But there’s still that nagging feeling, that sound of hooves echoing in the back of my mind, making it impossible to fully relax.

Tonight, I’ll stay up a little later. There’s something about this place that makes me feel like I should be paying more attention to it, like it’s trying to tell me something. I just don’t know what it is yet.

-Tom

**October 25th**  
*Rättvik, Sweden*

It’s been five days since we arrived, and I should feel more settled by now, but the strange moments are starting to pile up. Yesterday’s fishing trip seemed like a good way to unwind, but after what happened last night, I’m not so sure anymore.

The day started well enough. We picked up some fishing rods in town, and the locals were friendly, if still a bit reserved whenever the river came up in conversation. I didn’t think much of it at the time—every town has its quirks. Maria didn’t seem to notice; she was too caught up in the quiet beauty of the place. I’ve never seen her this relaxed in months, and it’s been nice, honestly. It makes me want to stay longer.

But last night… something was different.

After we came back from our walk in the woods, we settled in for the evening. Maria fell asleep quickly, as did Ashley. I stayed up a little later, restless for no particular reason. It’s not that I’m uncomfortable here. If anything, it’s too comfortable—like the silence wraps around you in a way that’s almost suffocating. I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s the kind of quiet that makes you feel like you’re the only thing alive in the world.

Around midnight, I thought I heard music.

It was faint at first—just a few soft notes, like someone plucking a stringed instrument from a distance. I thought maybe it was Maria in her sleep, or perhaps just the house settling, but then the sound grew clearer, closer, like someone playing a violin outside. The melody was slow, deliberate, almost… inviting.

I went to the window and looked out, but there was nothing. Just the same dark forest and the river beyond, its surface gleaming faintly in the moonlight. I stood there for a while, listening. The music continued, but it felt so far away, like it was coming from beneath the earth or the river itself. I can’t explain it.

After a few minutes, it stopped completely, leaving behind an even deeper silence than before. 

I didn’t wake Maria. I figured there was no need to worry her over something so small, especially when she’s been sleeping so well for the first time in ages. But I couldn’t help noticing how peaceful she looked, almost unnaturally so, as if she were in a trance. It was unsettling in its own way, seeing her so still, her breathing so steady.

I couldn’t sleep after that. Instead, I sat by the window, watching the river. The longer I stared, the more it seemed to move differently—slower, almost as if the water itself was thickening, becoming more than just a natural flow. And then there were the shadows. At first, I thought they were just from the trees, but they didn’t seem to line up with anything. They moved too fluidly, shifting beneath the surface like something alive was passing through the water. But again, when I blinked, the river was just the river.

This morning, I felt off. I didn’t tell Maria about the music or the strange way the water seemed to ripple in the night. I don’t want to seem paranoid. I’m sure it’s nothing more than my imagination—nerves from being in such an isolated place. But it’s not like me to get rattled by something so simple.

We went for another walk today, just along the river this time. Maria was as cheerful as ever, taking more photos, saying how she wishes we could stay longer. Even Ashley seemed to be in better spirits, smiling and cooing more than she has in days. I should be happy about that, but I keep thinking about last night. The music. The shadows. And I swear I saw something moving out of the corner of my eye again while we were near the water, but when I looked, there was nothing. Just the wind playing tricks, I guess.

Maria mentioned wanting to try fishing again tomorrow. I didn’t argue, but part of me doesn’t want to spend any more time near the river. There’s something about it—something I can’t put into words. It’s beautiful, yes, but in a way that feels too perfect. Like it’s not quite real. I can’t shake the feeling that it’s watching us somehow, waiting for something.

I’ll try to sleep tonight. Maybe I’ll hear the music again, or maybe it’ll be quiet, and all of this will just fade away. I hope it’s the latter. But there’s a part of me that wonders what I’ll see if I keep looking.

-Tom

**October 26th**  
*Rättvik, Sweden*

I didn’t hear the music again last night, but I’m not sure if that’s a relief or if it makes things worse. The silence was oppressive, heavier than before, as if the cabin itself had sunk deeper into the forest’s quiet. I could hear Maria breathing beside me, slow and steady, but something about it was too... rhythmic. Almost mechanical. I lay awake for hours, staring at the ceiling, trying to push that irrational thought out of my mind.

This morning, things took a strange turn. Maria seemed fine when she woke up—bright, cheerful, almost *too* cheerful, given how little sleep I got. She wanted to spend the day by the river again, said it was so peaceful and good for Ashley. Normally, I’d agree. But today, something was different.

While I was preparing breakfast, I noticed that Maria had taken Ashley outside without saying anything. That’s not unusual on its own, but she was standing right by the riverbank, cradling Ashley in her arms, whispering something. I couldn’t make out the words from inside the cabin, so I went to the window to get a better look. Maria was facing the water, rocking Ashley gently, but her movements were too slow, too deliberate—almost hypnotic. And the way she was speaking... it wasn’t the soft cooing she normally does. It sounded like she was murmuring a lullaby, but not one I’d ever heard before. The melody was unfamiliar, unsettling, with long, drawn-out notes that seemed to blend with the sound of the river.

I stepped outside and called to her, but she didn’t respond. She just stood there, swaying with Ashley, her back to me. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. I’ve never seen Maria like that—so completely absorbed in something, as if I didn’t exist. When I finally got close enough to touch her shoulder, she flinched, blinking like she’d been in a trance.

“What were you saying to her?” I asked, trying to sound casual, though my pulse was racing.

Maria looked confused, as if she didn’t remember what she’d been doing. “Nothing,” she said with a soft laugh, brushing it off. “Just talking to her, like always.”

I didn’t press it at the time, but I know what I heard. And it wasn’t just talking. There was something almost... melodic in the way she was speaking. Like she was mimicking that strange music I’d heard the night before. But when I tried to bring it up again later, she didn’t seem to know what I was talking about.

It doesn’t end there. After breakfast, Maria wanted to go for another walk by the river, but I suggested we explore the town instead. I didn’t want to spend more time near that water, not after what I’d seen. She agreed, but she seemed... distant, distracted, as if her mind was somewhere else the entire time. I kept catching her looking over her shoulder, back toward the cabin, like she was listening for something.

We didn’t stay in town long. Maria was unusually quiet, which is rare for her. She kept saying she was just tired, that the fresh air was making her sleepy, but I don’t believe her. I could see it in her eyes—something was pulling at her, drawing her thoughts back to the river, even as she tried to pretend everything was normal.

When we got back to the cabin, I noticed Maria took Ashley outside again, this time without saying a word to me. I watched from the window as she stood by the riverbank, just like this morning. This time, though, she was holding Ashley in a way that made my stomach knot with unease—closer to the water, too close. The same slow rocking, the same soft murmuring that felt more like a chant than anything else.

I rushed outside, trying to keep my voice steady as I called to her. 

She turned to me, and for a split second, there was something in her expression that chilled me to the bone. Her eyes were unfocused, like she was still half in that trance. But then she blinked, and it was gone. She smiled, as if nothing was wrong, and handed Ashley over to me.

“I was just showing her the river,” she said, her voice light and casual, as if it was the most normal thing in the world.

But I could see it—the way her gaze lingered on the water, how her body seemed drawn to it, as if the river itself was calling her. She looked peaceful, almost *too* peaceful, in a way that felt wrong. Off. Like she was waiting for something, or someone, to come from the water.

I didn’t let her take Ashley down to the river again after that. I kept them both inside for the rest of the afternoon, finding any excuse to distract her. But I could feel it. She was restless, like part of her was somewhere else, and no matter how hard she tried to focus on us, her thoughts kept drifting back to the river.

I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t know if it’s just me—if this place is getting to me in ways I don’t understand—but Maria is different. It’s subtle, but it’s there. She’s always been calm, always at peace in nature, but this is something else. It’s like the river has a hold on her. Like it’s whispering to her, just like the music I heard in the night.

I’ll watch her closely tonight. I need to figure out what’s going on, and if it’s just my mind playing tricks, or if there’s something more happening here. Something I can’t explain.

-Tom

  
**October 27th**  
*Rättvik, Sweden*

I didn’t sleep again. The nights here have become unbearable, stretching out into endless hours of quiet where my thoughts refuse to settle. Maria slept soundly next to me, her breaths slow and deep, but I swear I heard something outside—soft at first, like a whisper carried by the wind. I waited, listening, but nothing came.

This morning, Maria seemed different again. There’s a stillness about her now, like she’s always on the edge of slipping away. She was humming while she made breakfast, the same melody I’ve heard her humming for the past few days—soothing and strange, like something from a dream I can’t quite remember. It wraps itself around my thoughts and won’t let go.

I’ve noticed other changes, too, little things I can’t quite explain. Maria’s movements have become unnervingly fluid, like she’s moving through water even when she’s not. And her eyes—they’re different. Darker, somehow. I can’t be sure if it’s real or if it’s just the shadows of this place, playing tricks on me.

Ashley has stopped fussing altogether. She just watches now, silent and wide-eyed, as if she knows something I don’t.

Maria took her down to the river again this afternoon. I followed, keeping my distance. I didn’t want to interrupt, but I also couldn’t let her out of my sight. They were standing by the water’s edge, Maria whispering softly as she dipped her toes into the water. I couldn’t make out what she was saying, but it felt wrong, like something I wasn’t supposed to hear.

When I called her name, she turned slowly, her face calm with that same strange smile. “It’s beautiful here, isn’t it?” she said, like nothing was wrong. But I could feel it—something deep, twisting beneath the surface of her words.

I’m starting to wonder if the river is doing something to us. Changing us.

I’ve decided that we need to leave. Tomorrow, first thing. I don’t care if Maria protests—I’ll pack everything myself if I have to. This place isn’t right. Something is *wrong* here, and I’m done pretending it’s just my imagination.

I’ll tell her in the morning. We’ll go back home, and everything will be fine. It has to be.

-Tom

  
**October 28th**  
*Rättvik, Sweden*

I tried to talk to Maria this morning about leaving, but it’s like she couldn’t even hear me. She stared at me blankly, like I wasn’t making sense. I insisted we should go, that something is wrong with this place, but she just smiled and said, “Why would we leave? It’s perfect here.”

Perfect. That word again. She’s been saying it more and more lately, and each time, it sounds emptier, like an echo of something she doesn’t understand.

The strange thing is, part of me wanted to agree with her. For a moment, when I looked out at the river from the window, the thought crossed my mind that maybe she’s right. Maybe there’s no reason to leave. The water glistened in the morning light, calm and inviting, as if it were waiting for us.

But no. That’s not me. That’s this place, *whatever* it is. It’s seeping into our minds, twisting things. I can feel it more with each passing hour.

Later today, Maria took Ashley down to the river again. This time, I followed closely. I didn’t trust her to be alone with Ashley near the water, not after yesterday. She stood ankle-deep in the river, cradling Ashley in her arms and humming that same, eerie melody. Her voice sounded different, though—warmer, deeper, like it was coming from somewhere far beneath the surface.

And then… It happened.

For a moment—just a moment—I saw something else. Something *impossible*. Maria’s reflection in the water wasn’t hers. It was dark, twisted—long limbs, skin pale like a corpse, and eyes that shimmered with a cold, predatory light. The face was hers, but not quite—stretched, distorted, like something wearing her skin as a mask.

My chest tightened, and I called her name, loud, panicked. She turned to me, slowly, and the reflection shifted back to normal, as though it had never been anything else. Maria smiled, oblivious, and asked if I was alright, her voice calm and sweet.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. I just took Ashley from her arms, holding her close as my heart pounded in my chest.

I didn’t tell Maria what I saw. What would I even say? That I saw something in her reflection that shouldn’t exist? That the water is showing me things that can’t be real? She wouldn’t believe me. Hell, *I* don’t believe it, but I can’t deny what I saw.

Tomorrow. Tomorrow we leave, no matter what.

-Tom

**October 29th, 2024**  
*Rättvik, Sweden*

I can’t leave.

I don’t know how it happened. I woke up this morning with every intention of packing, of getting us out of here, but something stopped me. Something in the air. It’s hard to describe, but it feels like the very ground beneath us is pulling us back, like we’ve already become part of this place, like the river won’t let us go.

Maria has been by the water all day, her feet in the river, watching it move. I haven’t been able to bring myself to drag her away. She seems so at peace, so content, and Ashley—she hasn’t cried once. Her tiny body rests against Maria’s chest, as still as the water.

I joined them by the riverbank earlier. I wasn’t sure why, but the air seemed lighter there, more peaceful. The water flowed so gently, its surface catching the fading sunlight. And for a moment, I thought I heard it again—the music. Soft, distant, beautiful.

Then I saw it.

There, in the river—just beneath the surface—something was moving. At first, it looked like a shadow, twisting and flowing along with the current. But then it rose, just slightly, and I caught a glimpse of it. Pale skin. Eyes too large, too bright. A face, staring up at me from beneath the water, smiling. Its features flickered and shifted, becoming Maria’s face for an instant before warping into something else—something dark, something that *shouldn’t exist*.

I stumbled back, my breath catching in my throat. The figure faded back into the depths, vanishing as though it had never been there. I turned to Maria, but she didn’t seem to notice. She was humming again, her eyes locked on the water, the same distant smile on her lips.

I don’t know what’s real anymore.

Night has fallen, and the cabin is deathly quiet. Maria is sitting by the window, staring out at the river, her back to me. Ashley is in her arms, sleeping peacefully. I’ve been watching them for hours, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is wrong—terribly, terribly wrong.

I feel it now, deep inside me, like the river has seeped into my veins. There’s no escaping it. I don’t think I want to escape anymore.

I’m so tired. Maybe I’ll go down to the river, just for a moment, just to see. The water is so calm. So inviting.

We’ll all go.

-Tom and Maria
