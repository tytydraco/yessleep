&#x200B;

Since it's now close to Halloween again I figured it would be a good time to share a mission I went on around this time. In particular, it was a little under a week until the thirty-first.  It’s actually my birthday month, being on the twenty-second. I know some people think it’s annoying to share a birthday month with popular holidays. Personally, I don’t mind.

&#x200B;

I’ve never been one to want to go big with celebrating my birthday anyway. That said, Dean always made sure to treat me in some way. Sometimes it was taking me out to the movies, or the arcade, or even a theme park which would always be decked up for Halloween.  Once he, Stella, Brice, and Sheila even held a surprise party for me. While I did appreciate the gesture, I also found it a bit overwhelming.

&#x200B;

Sheila had invited a bunch of friends over from her school and Birce had convinced some students from ours to come as well. I know how odd that sounds.  I can handle vampires and entities possessing people and yet somehow I’m bothered by an overabundance of socializing. Go figure, right? Anyway, that year in question was my fifteenth birthday.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean took me out to see a movie. I think it was one of the Conjuring ones which we didn’t find all that great. Still, we had fun watching it together and then after we got some Italian food. It was Thursday and I was at home reading when I heard Dean call me downstairs. When I saw him, I noticed he was getting off the phone with someone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Who were you on the phone with?” I asked.

“HQ, they got another assignment for us.”

“Should I start packing then?”

“Here’s the thing. We need to go to Orlandsville.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I froze and I felt the hairs on my neck rise.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“But that’s Sheila’s town. Are you saying she’s in trouble?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean raised a hand to get me to calm down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“As far as we know, she’s fine, but we need to take care of this before anyone else gets hurt.”

“What are we dealing with exactly?”

“In short, some kind of shapeshifter.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean further elaborated by explaining the one in question was an energy stealer. All it needed to do was touch someone to drain their life force. The person would then experience rapid internal deterioration in only a few days.  With it being a time for costumes, it was basically harvest season for this thing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How many people has it gotten already?”

“According to the town hospital records,  I’d say at least a dozen. It seems to need time to recover after each “meal” if you want to call it that. By our estimate, it always hides for two or three days before seeking out a new victim.”

“Any ideas where it came from?”

Dean shook his head.

“Sorry, no and we aren’t clear on any weakness either. Someone we interviewed said they tried shooting at it and it just shrugged it off, then ran away.  Therefore, capturing it is our only option. We’re going to be leaving tomorrow. For now, we need to do some shopping.”

“Where?”

‘Party City.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I cocked my head to the side.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why exactly?”

“This thing’s smart and there’s a party going on in the town. If we show up as we are now, it’ll get paranoid and then we’ll lose track of it.”

“Oh, right, I guess that makes sense.”

“Good, now make sure you use the bathroom or whatever. I’m going to start the car.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Party City was packed which made sense given how it was less than a week until Halloween.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, so we want costumes that are going to be easy to move in. That means nothing with capes and no masks.”

“I mean, you could paint your face and go as Jack Skellington?”

“Nah, everyone and their cat has already done that.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Something caught Dean’s eye.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This could work.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He grabbed a 007 costume off the hook.

“Dean, won’t it be kind of obvious if an agent dresses as, you know, an agent?”

“It’s called hiding in plain sight and since I already got mine, you need to pick something out. Try to make it quick. I don’t want to be here all night.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I shopped around for a little while with Dean checking out some decorations. Meeting the costume criteria wasn’t easy and I didn’t want to copy what Dean was doing. I was about to suggest trying another store when my eyes fell on it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, Dean?” I  called out.

“Yeah?” he replied, setting down a skull-shaped candy bowl.

“Okay, I think I have a costume idea.”

“Finally.”

“But isn’t here.”

“What?”

“I kind of need things to make it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He stared at me and blinked several times.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We’ve been shopping for nearly an hour just for you to tell me that?”

“I know I only need a few things/”

“Like?”

“A long brown coat,  a red handkerchief, and a cowboy hat.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now. Dean was the one looking confused.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You know they have cowboy costumes here, right?”

“Not of who I want to be.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He rolled his eyes and let out a sigh.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alright, there are some other stores in this shopping center anyway. Is there anything else you’re going to need?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I gave that some thought.

“Some revolvers would be nice.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Finding what I needed didn’t take nearly as long as our trip to Party City. I’m betting Dean was thankful for this. Soon. I had everything I needed to make my costume. We left for our road trip the following morning. It was nearly dusk by the time we arrived in Orlandsville.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean pulled into the first hotel we saw. In this case, it was a Days Inn. We parked and before we got out, I asked Dean something.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I was wondering. How exactly are we going to catch this thing?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean pointed past me. I looked to see Stella pulling into the parking space beside us. We got out to greet her.

“It’s good to see you guys again. Have you gotten taller, Zane?”

“I mean my birthday was only a week ago.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stella nodded and then turned her attention to Dean.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Have you got your costumes all picked out?”

“Yep, what about you?”

“Of course, Janet spent hours the other night helping me make it.”

“Yours is homemade too?” I chimed in.

“That’s right and I want it to be a surprise until the party.”

“Same, what did you bring to help with the you know what?”

“You’ll see tomorrow.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We headed in and booked some rooms. Before going to mine, I stopped at the vending machines and got some drinks and snacks.  I’m not usually a major junk food fiend. However, given the season I figured I would be alright. Plus, I needed a little something to keep me occupied and not worried about Sheila.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To help further with this, I made use of my room’s TV. You’d think I would’ve learned my lesson about staying up late. Instead, I  watched some Cartoon Network, mainly the Adventure Time and Regular Show Halloween specials. After that, it was Adult Swim where I watched mostly Family Guy and The Simpsons.  At least, I didn’t have anything with caffeine.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I got to bed around one in the morning.  I woke up to Stella knocking on my door.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane, get up. We need to leave soon.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I told her I’d be out in a minute, then I went into the bathroom to get ready. Stella never passed up free breakfast. As usual, her plate was mostly eggs with a bit of bacon, a cup of yogurt, and some coffee. Dean was having a cup of coffee as well along with some strawberry oatmeal. I got a container of orange juice and filled one of the larger cups with some Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At least, I think it was. Knowing the hotel, it was most likely some off-brand cereal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So, when’s the party?” I asked as I sat down with my food.

“Not until eight, “ Dean replied. “We need to be prepared in  the meantime.”

“How are we even going to find this thing?”

“It shouldn’t be too hard,” Stella said. “We know it’s attracted to large groups. All we have to do is look for someone who’s acting off.”

“Like drunk?”

“No, this thing has a way of being spotted.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

According to some witnesses around town, before the shapeshifter touched someone, they swore they saw it become covered in static for a split second.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, and what do we do once we find it?”

“This thing’s not that strong physically so some kind of net should do the trick,” Dean interjected. “I’m guessing that’s what you’ve brought, Stella?”

“Good guess, I’ll show you  after we’re done eating.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Going out to Stella’s truck she showed us something I wasn’t expecting to be so portable. It was there gun-shaped objects, one for each of us.  These weren’t actual firearms. In fact, they were closer to T-shirt cannons in appearance except smaller.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What are these for?” I asked.

“Net guns,” Stella replied.  “One pull of the trigger and it shoots one out made of Kevlar. This should be more than enough to snag our little shapeshifter party crasher.”

“How do we even know it’s going to be there?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean and Stella stared at me as if the answer was obvious. In fairness, it was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane, think about it.  A lot of stuff happens at parties that go unnoticed by people. It’s going to be the perfect cover for it,” Dean said.

“Okay, and how do we know it’ll show up at this one in particular?”

“Because we’ll have bait.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It took me a moment to connect the dots.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh, you have got to be shitting me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I knew why we couldn’t wear costumes with masks.  The party was being held in the town rec center.  I’d only been there a couple times while living in Olrandsville and never for Halloween.  Despite this, my memories of every time I’d been there came back as soon as we pulled into the parking lot. We got out in our costumes, Dean in his 007 getup and Stella went as Jessica from Dune.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She even had the stillsuit on. It was incredible and it made Dean and I feel incredibly shown up. We each had places where our net guns would be easily accessible. Mine was in my inside coat pocket. Dean’s was in the same place and Stella’s was in a satchel that was strapped around her chest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We went up to the front entrance.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane!” I heard right before getting blindsided by a hug from Sheila.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For someone so scrawny, she was surprisingly strong and I nearly got thrown off balance. I managed to keep my footing and she released me. Her costume was from an anime. I’m pretty sure it was something from Naruto judging by the headband she wore. I was never into that show personally.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s been too long. Why didn’t you tell me you were coming?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced past her at Dean and Stella. The former shook his head.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I thought I’d surprise you,” I said. “You’re looking good.”

“Thanks, I never figured you for the Western type.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Slightly annoyed, I wanted to correct her on my costume. However, there were bigger things to worry about. In hindsight, we should’ve expected her to be there. What we couldn’t have anticipated, is who I ran into next. Sheila caught up with Dean and got acquainted with Stella.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The latter of whom got more compliments on her costume. While catching up with Sheila was fun, we needed to do our job. I told her I was heading inside and she said she’d catch up with me in a bit. There must have been something fishy going on with the politics of Orlandsville because the rec center had virtually no security. There were only a handful of cops on patrol, presumably to keep concern down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Reports of the shapeshifter were also being swept under the rug. As I have explained, I’m not big on parties on a good day. When I’m on the lookout for some predator it adds another layer of anxiety. I needed to be careful with my net gun. It was difficult to keep myself from constantly reaching into my coat pocket.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It only had one use and I was being too jumpy. Getting tapped on my shoulder didn’t help alleviate that feeling. I spun around to see Brice in a Dragon Ball Z Saiyan armor costume.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, Zane, what are you doing here?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was the second time I’d been caught off guard that night.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I could ask you the same thing.”

“Me? Well, Sheila and I got to talking on the phone like two weeks ago and I asked her if she’d like me to come here.. It took a lot of convincing, but I got my parents to drive me. Apparently,  I have a great-aunt or something who lives in the area so we’ve been stopping at her place. She’s a nice woman.”

“It’s good to see you too. I already bumped into Sheila outside. Actually, she bumped into me, but that’s beside the point.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Brice studied me for a moment, visually scanning my costume.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What, do I have something on my shirt?” I asked, checking and finding nothing out of place.

“Roland,”  he exclaimed, snapping his fingers.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I found myself smiling. He and I were heavy Stephen King fans and I was glad he got the Dark Tower reference he was going for.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wow, you’re the first person to get it right. I’ve been hearing  “cool cowboy” since I got here. Even Sheila thinks I’m dressed as one.”

“Since when have you been into Westerns?”

“That’s what I’m saying.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We talked for a bit, mostly about school and which teachers were getting on our nerves.  Then we grabbed some food, bat-shaped pizza slices, and some mozzarella olive eyeballs on toothpicks. Along with that, he got a cup of Coke and I got Sprite.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, catching up?” Sheila asked, coming up to us with some food of her own, mostly fruit from a ghost-shaped plater and some lemonade.

“Yeah,” Brice replied, “I was just about to ask Zane what he did for his birthday.”

“Oh, not much, just a movie and then out to eat after. You know, the usual.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We chatted for a bit more. Sheila asked me if I’d gotten into any new shows and I told her One Piece was pretty.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I have an idea,” Brice said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The ringtone of my phone interrupted the conversation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Sorry, I need to take this,” I said after checking it and seeing Dean on the caller ID.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That could only mean one thing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s alright,” Sheila said. “We’ve got plenty of time to hang out.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I stepped away and answered, making sure to keep my voice low.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Is it here already? “ I asked. “I haven’t seen anyone acting off or anything.”

“We haven’t either. We think it’s waiting for the most amount of people to arrive first.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked over at Brice and Sheila. He’d apparently said something funny indicated by the lemonade spewing out of her nose. I  chuckled slightly, wondering what he could’ve told her to get that reaction.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane?”  Dean said, snapping my thoughts back to the seriousness at hand.

“Yeah, what should I do then?”

“Kepp your eyes peeled like you’ve been doing. With any luck, we’ll bag this thing and then you can enjoy your time with Brice and Sheila stress-free.”

“How did you know Brice was here?”

“I passed by him grabbing some popcorn and Reesee’s Pieces. I didn’t say anything, though. How is he?”

“Fine as far as I can tell.”

“Good, let’s hope we keep things that way.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My stress meter was already unhealthy high. Now, the metaphorical needle was threatening to break off.  There was no telling where this thing would come from. I had to be wary of anyone who was even slightly off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane?” Sheila called.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I turned and immediately noticed she was alone.

“Where’s Brice?” I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

An icy feeling was working its way down my back.

“Oh yeah, Brice thought it’d be a good idea to hit up the arcade at the movies up the street. He’s outside.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Whatever she was going to say next, I didn’t hear. The moment I heard Brice was outside, I was off like a bat out of Hell.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Brice,” I shouted, seeing him waiting on a park bench.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was a statue on the left side of it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane?” he replied, obviously bewildered by how I was acting.

&#x200B;

“You need to get inside now. There is something dangerous that could be here any minute. Hell, it could already be here and we don’t know it yet.”

&#x200B;

“Dude, you know we’re not supposed to be drinking from the spiked punch.”

&#x200B;

“I’m serious.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was about to respond when I caught something from my peripheral as a heart-stopping realization dawned on me.  It turned out our assessment was wrong. The shapeshifter only could turn into something humanoid. That didn’t necessarily mean it could only change to mimic a human and that statue hadn’t been there before.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The statue became awash with static and made a grab for Brice. Luckily, my reaction time was on point and I got a clean shot on it. The kevlar net shot out, ensnaring it and sending it falling to the sidewalk.  I did it and it was a lot easier than I thought. A now wide-eyed Brice looked from it to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What the fuck is that?”

“It’s a lot to explain.  For now, just stay away from that thing.”

“Okay,” he agreed, not having grasped the situation yet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was such a moron. I should’ve known things wouldn’t have been that simple. He turned his back on the creature. I didn’t even have time to warn him when I saw it move. The shapeshifter's hand shot through the kevlar as if it were silly string. It grabbed him by the neck and I saw that same static now enveloping him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Brice,” I screamed as it tossed him aside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I dashed towards the thing. I know that’s stupid. I wasn’t thinking straight. It didn’t matter anyway. It was already fleeing back into the woods.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I tried my best to keep up with it. Unfortunately, with its ability, this proved fruitless. I dropped to my knees, hollering out a long fuck, and slammed my fists on the grass. All the commotion attracted Dean and the others. Later, Dean, Stella, and I were at the hospital.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It didn’t take an X-ray to know Brice was in bad shape, especially since they’d been getting patients in similar condition. His parents were called right away and were in shambles about their son’s sudden turn for the worst.  My emotions were a mixture of anger and guilt.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You said the net guns were supposed to work,” I  told Stella trying my damndest to keep my voice from rising.

“They should have. I didn’t know how strong it actually was.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not wanting an argument to erupt, Dean interjected.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“None of us could have.”

“Tell that Brice. We were supposed to stop that thing. It was our responsibility.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was a gasp by the door. It was Sheila now in regular clothes like the rest of us. I was trying to think of something to say when she said something that shut down anything I could have come up with.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You knew about that thing this entire time?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mouth snapped shit, then I opened it.

“How do you-?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I came outside and saw that thing grab him. I didn’t believe it until I overheard you three talk just now.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I asked Dean and Stella if they could leave us alone. They complied and it was only Sheila and me having a conversation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, look, I’ll admit there’s some things I haven’t been exactly forthright about.”

“We’re your friends and you didn’t even think to warn us? Do you not care about us?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She was tearing up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You know that’s not true. It’s complicated.”

“We wanted to tell you tonight.”

“What?”

“He and I decided to get together, but now…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sheila’s voice trailed off as she stared at Brice on the hospital bed.  She glared back in my direction, then raised an arm as if to strike me, lowered it, and left the room.  Slap or not, I felt like dogshit all the same. I dug my nails into my palms. At least there was one thing I got from my failed attempt.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I knew catching it [wasn’t](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) an [option.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
