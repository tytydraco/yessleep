TW:Abuse and brief mention of animal abuse because I can only use one tag.

Authority.

The concept always made my skin crawl, someone thinking they are better than me just because they got a few extra quid in their pocket or they have a job that supposedly grants them 'power'. 

My dad used to think he was better than me...he had none of those things over me though, his were far more aggravating. He bullied me because I was small, because I was a girl, because I couldn't hurt him like he hurt me. Throwing his weight around, of which there was a lot of, disgruntled me even at an early age and it only got worse as I got older...though maybe that's because he got worse too. 

I remember the first time he hit me, it had been sudden though I can't say all too unexpected. Rules were very important in our house, that and routine were sacred. What's relevant to this story is the rule about touching his things. He and mam were out looking for baby clothes, my younger brother Ollie was turning a year old and dad was tight with his spending refusing to let mum buy it since she was a 'silly mare'. 

As always I was given a list of tasks, I struggled to read at the time so usually I would get mam to read them for me though he had ushered her out before I got the chance. Naturally, I misinterpreted one or two, or all of them. By the end I had gotten so frustrated and confused I decided to clean everything. This lead me to his cabinet, it had all kinds of knickknacks I couldn't really describe even now, some were metal, others made of bone and it all looked as if it belonged on a museum display. 

Being only six, I couldn't reach the top shelf so I stacked boxes until I could climb, I swore at the time with enough of them I could get to heaven. Me and the feather duster were like Batman and Robin, it was Batman and I was the bumbling clumsy idiot. My movements were brash and rapid and slapped over many of the little decorations. Eventually, one shattered on the floor crumbling to dust and looked like the powder dad would have on weekends. 

I knew I was in trouble but I was never really scared, in fact I never really felt much of anything. 

They got back while I tried to push one of my barbies into some tiny room in my doll house definitely not made for a barbies. Mam was the one to call me, her voice had a funny twinge too it. A kind of tremble as if she was speaking through a fan. 

He wasn't immediately screaming like an ape so that was good. Mam came down to my eye level ready to say something but she couldn't quite manage it. Her breath was laboured and tears trailed as if the light behind her eyes was draining. Dad yanked her up by the hair before gripping me by the shoulder. 

I didn't bother looking back at my mother, no point when she was like that dad said. 

"Did ya do this?" He asked coldly, level and controlled. 

Dangerous. 

I must not tell lies. 

"Yes." The crack was deafening. I stumbled backwards clutching my cheek. It burned, radiating across my face like a sun burn. 

"Ya ever," He began. His pig like face contorted into little more than a frown though rage blazed in his eyes. "Touch ma shite again ya little cunt, I'll lock ya in tha' room and never let you out. Ya understand mi?" 

Distantly, I nodded before scurrying away. 

As I ascended the stairs, I wondered why my mouth was tugged up like that. 


About a year later in early Febuary I was getting ready for school. The squirrel I had caught a few days earlier had starved to death in the cage I had trapped it in. I sighed putting the pin back in my drawer. 

Maybe another day I supposed. 

Mam was cooking breakfast as always, she had never been very good but that day was a disaster. Her limp she had gotten the day before left her barreling around the room in a tizzy. She was like Gordon Ramsay with a concussion and no hands. 

I robotically ate my cereal, not really enjoying the soggy mush but not having the energy to complain. My brother Ollie threw his spoon at my head, I looked at him cocking an eyebrow. He mimicked me, I giggled handing it back to him. The sound of dad crawling out of his coffin was heard above us, his heavy carcass crashing around making far more noise than was ever necessary. 

Briefly, Mam bristled at this and gave me a look I still don't understand before continuing with her tasks. Dad had told me the other day not to bother trying to understand her, he claimed she was only good because he could use her front teeth as a bottle opener. 

I half registered that since then I'd treated her differently though I couldn't place how. 

Mam cowered over the pan as he stormed into the room, snatching up the newspaper off the counter. Even Ollie knew not to whinge at this time, dad was volatile at the best of times but before coffee he was always at his worst. Suddenly losing my appetite, I went to wash my bowel half hoping the cold water would distract me from the monster in the room. 

I don't know what happened next, maybe something smashing or a bit of shouting. As soon as I saw Ollie's chair begin to topple that's where my attention remained. Like lightning I crossed the room, clumsily yanking the chair upright. I fumbled with the clip, something bashed into my back but I ignored it pulling Ollie out. 

I turned around. 

My mam's eye was swollen, black and bulging like a golf ball. Blood ran down her face coming from god knows where but it was everywhere, dad loomed over her  like a predator his voice quiet and vile. An iron in his hand, the imprint of my mothers face dripping off it. 

In my right mind, I'd think Dad probably should have turned it on as it would have done far more damage. 

In that moment however, something ugly crawled up my throat. A feeling most foreign. It was a dark and rancid kind of feeling, it was hot and crawled up my throat threatening to bubble over. 

It was rage, white hot rage. 

"Get 'er ready...I'll deal with you later cow." Dad announced briskly making his leave while slamming the door so hard the handle came loose hanging limply like squidwards nose. 


Mam helped me dress, she couldn't help me with the buttons since dad broke her index finger. Painfully, she guided me to the front door. Irritatingly she kept playing with my hair and stroking me like a dog.

We stopped at the door, she knelt down to my eye level. 

I didn't like it and looked down. We weren't equals, dad said so.
She grasped my chin and lifted it up so I would be forced to meet her eye. 

"Are ya okay love?" She asked me gently. I nodded. "Am sorry ya 'ad to see tha'. Told 'im not in fron' a ya." 

"S'kay." I told her glumly. 

Mam looked over her shoulder, dad was upstairs having a shower, the tell a tale plume of steam bellowing out from under the door.

"Ya wanna go away?" She asked finally. 

"Pardon?" 

"On 'Oliday. Me, ya brother an you." She whispered quickly. "Goin' to ya nans...in Cornwall." 

I thought for a moment. "Ollie comin'" I asked. She nodded. "'Kay" 

She smiled a broken smile, blood stained her lip like lipstick and glass teeth were chipped from years of trauma. 

I left a half smile on my lips. 

I never saw my mother again.


Mam had been gone for two years. 

Slowly at first but by the time I turned nine all her chores were mine. Both myself and Ollie were my responsibility, dad said it was because he was the 'breadwinner' whatever that meant. It felt like she had handed me her duties, I didn't know how to feel about it at the time.

My birthday was as always a quiet affair, dad didn't bother to acknowledge it but Ollie had woken me early to give me a card he'd made in nursery. Anyone else's kid I'd have pointed out the fact it was like 90% the teacher but I was over the moon so let it slide. 

Dad scratched his arse as he stomped in, burping, he put a leathery hand on my shoulder and removed me from the fridge so he could grab a can of stellar. I resumed making Ollie's meal confused at the early start but I made no effort to challenge him.

I was about to get changed when he grabbed me by the arm. 

"Ya not goin' to school." He droned as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. 

"Why?" I asked confused, cocking my head to the side. 

"'Cause I fuckin said so, tha' not enough for ya?" He barked. "If it wha' up to me you'd never a gone, none a ya woulda! Been better off at 'ome anyway." He gestured at my chest for some reason.

I was bemused at his rant but shrugged. "Wha' 'bout Ollie?" 

"Take Tike later, he doesn't start 'till twelve."

I nodded and started my chores. For some reason it seemed like I caught his eye a lot more that day, especially as he got tipsy before I took Ollie to school. The teachers were confused at me being the one to bring him in but made little effort to look into it. When I got back he disappeared, no note or anything just an empty house and the thick smell of alcohol in the air. 

Exhausted, I figured I could get a few winks in before going back for Ollie. As sleep wrapped me in a warm comforting embrace, a sound not distant but not close either began to blow into my room. It was chatter, a kind of rhythmic 'tack' sound that quickly began to grate. 

I turned over electing to ignore it. 

Closer now, though I still tried to ignore it something panged in my stomach. 

What the hell was it?

Outside my room now, since mam left I had felt like a grown up, trusted with all kinds of jobs but in that moment I felt about Ollie's age. 

I buried my head under the covers. 

The door didn't open, it didn't matter, whatever was making the noise was in my room. Immediately, the temperature dropped. A weight pressed down on my bed inbetween my feet, slowly they eased over me, a hand pressed next to my head. 

I was ready to scream. 

Slowly, cautiously, gently I dragged the covers down from my face. 

I don't know what I hoped it was, my dad would hardley have been comforting but anything else was unimaginable to my young mind. 

It was mam. 

At least it looked that way at first, but she didn't look quite right. Like the last time I saw her, her lips were scarlet with blood but unlike then her skin was sickly pale, her hair slightly ginger when it should have been more blonde. Her eyebrow crooked and misshapen lifted as she looked at me. The source of the noise was obvious, her mouth hung disjointed from her face, her lower jaw hanging as if broken but it repeatedly bounced up and down like a yoyo cracking with the upper teeth mechanically. Investigating further it was obvious she had gnawed through her tongue which was missing the tip. 

A chunk of tooth landed on my nose. 

I'd never screamed before, in that moment I more than made up for it.

When I opened my eyes she was gone, a nightmare then...it had to be. Right? 

The blood stain shaped like a hand next to my head suggested differently. 

I never told a soul, no matter how many times I saw it. 



Weeks after the first sighting of what appeared to be my mother, I adapted to her presence. It became abundantly clear I was the only one who could see her, or at least the only one who was disturbed by her, which would be a first. 

Sometimes I'd bump into her while cooking, she'd make no effort to hurt me or anything. Nor would she communicate either though I tried. Everytime I got close to regaining my composure it would do something to put me on the back foot. For example as far as I knew it couldn't touch anything, I assumed she was a ghost or something, only for her to knock my dad's beer on the floor. 

That had gotten me a strange punishment, dad was high at the time and so I expected the punishment to be unorthodox, I didn't expect him to make me sit on the couch next to him until he could put out his cigar on my tongue. He watched me the whole time, his eyes never met my own though, I squirmed uncomfortably under his scrutiny. Funnily enough it was the closest we had been in a long time.

Mam watched coldly. 

It couldn't be her, she'd never look at him like that. 

She wouldn't get me in trouble like that...

By the time the month came to an end I was at my wits end. Dad had gone to 'work', also known as gambling mam's life insurance, when I blew up at the ghost. 

"Wha'the fuck ya wan' from mi?" She said nothing in response. "Leave me alone!" 

This seemed to spur her into action, slowly she trailed to the cellar door pointing at it. Usually she would just apparate around the room, thinking back on it was the only time I saw her move on her two feet. It was no wonder, every step seemed painful  her legs were thin bony twigs that would snap under any amount of weight. 

Reluctantly, I followed. 

Me and the cellar had a funny relationship, by funny I mean everything in it wanted to kill me. Everytime I went in something would fall, collapse or just straight up explode leaving me injured or centimetres from death. At the same time it smelled divine, about eight air freshners were constantly pumping something into the air, an undercurrent of something beneath them. It was repugnant but sweet, like trusting iron and rotting chicken.

Dad said it was mold.

The steps were rickety, old wet wood crumbling at the edges, which creaked as I descended. Yellow light made the fresh white walls look piss yellow. Mam was unconcerned with my trepidation pointed at some bin bags in the corner. 

Uncomfortable, I grabbed a pair of shears and poked the bag. A rat scampered out from behind the large black bags, I was in a half mind to abandon whatever this was so I could go experiment on it in my room like my neighbours cat, looking at my ghostly mothers dead eyes made me reconsider. 

Cringing, I put the idea on the back burner and got closer to the bags. 

Slowly, I pulled the bag open slightly. 

I gasped. 

My mothers head, frozen in a never ending scream lay at the top. Her eyes like rotten grapes went brown and black, her teeth yellow as the walls and her hair missing clumps and wilting. 

I know how I should have felt, at least now I do...at the time I couldn't help the little smile that pulled at my lips. In a way she looked beautiful, in a disgusting sort if way. 

What caught my attention the most however was certainly unexpected. 

A bite mark, one I now know was post mortem. 

Something about it, made my stomach churn like a washing machine. 

Why? 

It was all I could think. 

Why...that? 

Suddenly, the smell was too much. It was revolting, I never wanted to come down here again. I gipped a little in my mouth before racing up the stairs and to the bathroom. At every turn the ghost was there, but it looked different everytime. I saw several women, none I recognised except my mother, and just willed them to go away. 

Begged them silently in my mind to leave me me alone. 

They did. 

I never saw them again. 

Not even my mother. 

I showered after, I still don't think I'm clean enough.


It was a bad night. 

A really fucking bad night. 

The worst in a long time. 

I had been helping Ollie with his ABC's when dad thundered in, he barked all kinds of order but none made any sense. Clearly, energy drinks and vodka were a bad combo. 

While dad shit everything he had ever eaten into our toilet bowel Ollie turned to me. 

"Why's Da' not like ya?" He asked as I tried to remember a word beginning with Q. 

"Wha' makes ya say tha'" I asked relatively uninterested. His feeling were reciprocated after all. 

"Calls ya mean names n' that all the time...called ya a slag Monday." He murmured. 

The word held little significance for me, though apparently it was one of my first words so that was something. 

"Dunno, not bothered 'onestly. Kiss my arse can't he? Knobhead..." I muttered darkly. 

It was then he stumbled out of the toilet, his trousers discarded and his underwear caked in shit. Genuinely, the most fun I ever had with him as I watched him hobble into his room like a penguin. 

We got to the end of Ollie's homework by the time he tumbled into the living room. Clumsily, he smashed his knee into the setee and landed on Ollie's knee. 

I went still as I watched, something poking at my stomach. 

"Wha-ya fuckin...boy!" He roared grabbing Ollie by the shoulder. 

I stood, he didn't notice or didn't care. 

"Ya-" He heaved a ragged breath. "Did'n even try catch mi! Ya own fackin Da' an' ya did'n even try!" 

Ollie tried to reply but was caught off guard by suddenly being yanked by his ear into the middle of the room. 

"Get ya Fuck off 'im!" I screamed, my voice poison, words sharp as a needle. Anger took over my entire body, I stood silently seeting as he span around with wide eyes. I quaked in unbridled rage as he regarded me, the subservient daughter. 

He was far bigger than me, bigger than most. It went against my entire upbringing to do this, to even speak to him out of turn. 

I didn't care, couldn't even if I wanted. 

The slap came soon after. 

"Mi own daughter, I 'ant even done owt and she fuckin deserted mi! Just like ya whore of a mother! Ya gonna try leave? Join 'er." It had a double meaning he didn't know I knew. 

My jaw ached but I was too mad, I couldn't back down now. The fact that if I went to bed tonight I wasn't sure I'd wake up tomorrow hit surprisingly hard considering my age. 

I was afraid. 

Any distance between us was closed, his hot manky breath was enough to get me a little tipsy, his pig looking face was pinched in frustration, his skin as oily as a chip pan dripped onto his 'nice shirt' and his grey tangled hair hung over his left eye. I didn't know if he was going to punch or devour me with his fat cake hole.

The look in his eye frightened me. 

I'd seen it in the mirror.

Without warning, his flabby arms plucked me from my place on the carpet and suspended me in mid air. The suddenness caught me off guard, then he began to squeeze. 

It was the closest thing to a hug he had ever given me. 

Somewhere in my body something creaked, cracked and then snapped. 

I began to scream. 

Ollie rushed forward, even as young as he was he knew he had to try. It mattered little, he was too small, so was I. 

Something primal sparked in my mind, desperate and dangerous. I had to get out, it wasn't a question of if. I began thrashing in his arms, scratching, punching and kicking did little. Nothing could pull back enough to build up momentum, nothing hurt his inebriated body.

He gave another squeeze and I coughed blood. 

Darkness crept into my vision. 

I couldn't breath. 

I thought about my mother, the ghost, the body in the cellar. 

The bite mark. 

I thought about it every night, wondering why. 

Now I knew why. At least why it mattered to me in this moment.

I leaned forward and sank my teeth into his oesophagus. Surprised, he dropped me and therefore sealing his fate. I was small, smaller than most my age but with gravity on my side it didn't matter. His throat began to tear, his scream turned into a gurgle as a sound like tearing wet cloth echoed in the room. 

He slumped onto his knees, blood spurting from his neck like a chocolate fountain. His chubby hands clutched at flesh that wasn't there, his eyes slowly glazed over. We fell together, his fat carcass crushing me into the vibrant red carpet. 

His gob opened and closed as his life dripped onto my face, his last breath being the first I'd taken in over a minute. 

It felt like the first breath of my life.

I giggled as I tried to work my way free, because I was free. He was dead, I wasn't. A bird without a cage, I could spread my wings. Ollie stood slack jawed, unable to voice what he wanted. I knew what he was going to say anyway, I trotted over and wrapped him in a hug. Briefly, I kissed him on the cheek, smearing blood on him like lipstick. 

I felt so grown up. 

Our neighbours certainly got a shock when we arrived on their door step. 


Ollie doesn't remember that night, or at least he pretends not to. It doesn't matter, I do. When they put us in the home I was immediately irate. I was in charge, not them...Ollie was safe with me. People in charge always hurt you, so I have to be in charge so I can hurt them first. 

They gave us new parents. 

I despised my new dad. Just like the old one except he was convinced he could do it all on his own. Fucker tried to pamper me, make me breakfast in the morning or take Ollie to school. Those were my jobs, he was taking the only power I had. 

He wouldn't have authority over me, he'd never. 

I got my chance at christmas, he was diabetic you see. An easy target at the right time. When he collapsed at the table, honestly I didn't get the panic. Any old idiot would know, go get the EpiPen when he collapsed. 

Ollie's face made me pause. 

Worry was etched into his face, a terror I hadn't seen since dad. 

I got the EpiPen, weighed it in my hand. 

Originally, I planned to hide it. Let him die there on the floor, helpless and pathetically panting. 

It was always Ollie that made me reconsider these things. When I found the stray cat, instead of skinning it he made me keep it. Mr mittens had become one of my little people along with Ollie and his little friend at school. 

Would it be like when dad died? 

When he shut down...when he wouldn't speak to me? 

That wouldn't do at all. 

I gave the prick his EpiPen, it turned out well enough. They stopped babying me so much, called me a "big girl" which I'm ashamed to admit gave me butterflies. 

I tried to stop those habits and thoughts I knew would get me in trouble...really I did! Leaving animals alone was hard but I managed. A nasty habit of biting people popped up and I got given a rubber band to snap on my wrist if I ever got the urge. 

One thing I never got over was 'not respecting my seniors' as the headteacher ruled one day. But, I hadn't killed any of them. God I thought about it though, making them helpless before ripping out their voice. You can't tell anyone what to do without your voice. 

I told myself I wouldn't, for Ollie. 

I'm trying so hard, I bite my own arm but it's not the same. 

A boy asked me out the other day, it's not happened before. Most would be over the moon, I was more annoyed he'd asked me in public, pressured me into saying yes. 

He asked me.

ME! 

I ranted to Ollie, he just shrugged. 

I'm overreacting, of course I am. 

If he thinks he can tell me what to do...

I'm trying, okay?

I'm trying...
