**Tw : Blood and gore, domestic violence, child abuse, animal cruelty etc.**

Authority.

The concept always made my skin crawl, someone thinking they are better than me just because they got a few extra quid in their pocket or they have a job that supposedly grants them 'power'.

My dad used to think he was better than me...he had none of those things over me though, his were far more aggravating. He bullied me because I was small, because I was a girl, because I couldn't hurt him like he hurt me. Throwing his weight around, of which there was a lot of, disgruntled me even at an early age and it only got worse as I got older...though maybe that's because he got worse too.

I remember the first time he hit me, it had been sudden though I can't say all too unexpected. 

Rules were very important in our house, that and routine were sacred. What's relevant to this story is the rule about touching his things. He and mam were out looking for baby clothes, my younger brother Ollie was turning a year old and dad was tight with his spending refusing to let mum buy anything since she was a 'silly mare'.

As always I was given a list of tasks, I struggled to read at the time so usually I would get mam to read them for me though he had ushered her out before I got the chance this day. 

Naturally, I misinterpreted one or two, or all of them. 

By the end I had gotten so frustrated and confused I decided to clean everything. This lead me to his cabinet, it had all kinds of knickknacks I couldn't really describe even now, some were metal, others made of bone and it all looked as if it belonged on a museum display.

Being only six, I couldn't reach the top shelf so I stacked boxes until I could climb, I swore at the time with enough of them I could get to heaven. Me and the feather duster were like Batman and Robin, it was Batman and I was the bumbling clumsy idiot. My movements were brash and rapid and slapped over many of the little decorations. Eventually, one shattered on the floor crumbling to dust and looked like the powder dad would have on weekends.

I knew I was in trouble but I was never really scared, in fact I never really felt much of anything.

They got back while I tried to push one of my barbies into some tiny room in my doll house definitely not made for a barbies. Mam was the one to call me, her voice had a funny twinge too it. A kind of tremble as if she was speaking through a fan.

He wasn't immediately screaming like an ape so that was good. Mam came down to my eye level ready to say something but she couldn't quite manage it. Her breath was laboured and tears trailed as if the light behind her eyes was draining. Dad yanked her up by the hair before gripping me by the shoulder.

I didn't bother looking back at my mother, no point when she was like that dad said.

"Did ya do this?" He asked coldly, level and controlled.

Dangerous.

I must not tell lies.

"Yes." The crack was deafening. I stumbled backwards clutching my cheek. It burned, radiating across my face like a sun burn.

"Ya ever," He began. His pig like face contorted into little more than a frown though rage blazed in his eyes. "Touch my shite again ya little cunt, I'll lock ya in that room and never let you out. Ya understand me?"

Distantly, I nodded before scurrying away.

As I ascended the stairs, I wondered why my mouth was tugged up like that.



It was a crisp morning in January, I watched as rain droplets fell, hurtling towards the ground like crashing planes, unable to pivot or divert course. They smashed into the ground and ceased to exist. 

Nature was so fragile. 

I looked to the squirrel I captured the night before, it's little teeth gnawing on the bars of the cage as it desperately did it's best to escape. 

Boring. 

I emptied the cage and it's contents out the window, the squirrel landing roughly on a thin twisting branch before scampering away. I sighed pulling on my royal blue school cardigan. 

It wasn't fun to hurt something so helpless.

Mam, as always cowered by the kettle, hunched over a fresh brew. She stirred dutifully, counting each circle motion until hitting exactly 10. Swiftly, she planted it gently on my fathers coaster. She glanced at me in acknowledgment before returning to preparing for his arrival. 

Dad had told me the other day not to bother trying to understand her, he claimed she was only good because he could use her front teeth as a bottle opener.

I half registered that since then I'd treated her differently though I couldn't place how.

I ate quietly as always, the weetabix soft and gooey, flavourless like all foods to me. At least until a toy car smashed into them, I blinked mildly surprised before fishing it out with my fingers. 

My younger brother Ollie sat in the high chair and giggled at a joke only his little juvenile mind could conjure and comprehend. He babbled at me with one hand placed on his forehead the other buried to the knuckle in his mouth. 

I didn't, well I still don't, understand the concept of love. Caring for another being, taking in to consideration how they feel. 

It's foreign to me. 

But if I have ever loved anything in my life it was Ollie. 

My father's footsteps made the whole house creek and groan, as if it was as sick of his shit as I was. His steps thundered down the landing, and spilled into the tiny kitchen. 

Mam paled. 

Uninterested, I went back to my breakfast. 

The pig faced bastard strolled in as if he owned the kitchen and everyone in it. He had a sheen to his skin as if constantly laced with butter, his greying moustache was wild and unruly covering pimples and a scar from a bar fight he had many moons ago he often reminisced upon. His coarse grime hands grabbed at the utensils, his fingernail black and cracked. Greedily and messily he hovered up the meal in front him, forgetting to chew. 

Halfway through, he paused for a moment looking down at the plate. 

"Oi, where the fuck is half my meal?" He barked at my mother. She stood in the corner watching with a pained look on her face. 

Dad always demanded she be present at the table, but never allowed to sit at it. She fiddle with her apron that did the most to cover her body, the rest were torn and unkempt like the jeans she wore being torn to shreds at the bottom. Her dirty blonde hair tied back in a messy bun was damp with sweat. 

She batted a bang of hair out of her eye while she tried to for an excuse. "W-we're skint love. I had to pay for Rose's uniform and-and the eletric bill..." 

He looked at her suspiciously. "That cost you 800 quid did it?" 

"No the rest went to er..." 

"Spit it out woman!" Dad demanded.

"You're bender with Mickey and Alex, the hotel room and the uh entertainment-" She started. 

His hand smashed onto the table smashing his plate and making Ollie jump. I spooned up the rest of my food and dumped it into Ollie's little bowl. The beginning of a tantrum stamped out immediately at the extra serving.

He poked my nose as a thank you. 

"So you're blaming me 'cause you're shit at managing ya pennies, is that how it's gonna be is it?" He snarled nastily. 

"No-" Before she could retort his hand met her face. She staggered over to me and caught herself on the sink. It affected her very little, accustomed to his rough treatment. Her mouth a thin line and her shoulders sagged in resignation. 

She didn't care what he did to her. 

So neither would I. 

With fleeting interest I turned away, washing my bowel. Briefly I glanced over. Her face was tugged into a disgruntled, lost kind of look.

When her eyes landed on me however, her face contorted into something I can't quite describe, but it faded instantly and her face drooped into a passive and defeated expression. 

"Stupid cow, think you're so fucking clever go get a job then. I wouldn't waste a second of my time working so bint like you could skirt through life without seeing a hard days work." Dad spat, his closing statement for the meal before attempting to stomp out. 

The world slowed as he barged Ollie's high chair over in his frustration. 

In that moment, something ugly crawled up my throat. A feeling most foreign. It was a dark and rancid kind of feeling, it was hot and crawled up my throat threatening to bubble over.

It was rage, white hot rage.

As soon as I saw Ollie's chair begin to topple that's where my attention remained. Like lightning I crossed the room, clumsily yanking the chair upright. I fumbled with the clip, something bashed into my back but I ignored it pulling Ollie out.

I turned around, cradling little Ollie in my arms. I don't know what happened next, maybe something smashing or a bit of shouting. My focus was entirely on making sure Ollie was safe, probing at his body to make sure he was okay, something he took issue with. He grabbed my finger babbling before sticking it in his gob.

I looked at him cocking an eyebrow. He mimicked me, we giggled at each other.

I risked a glance around the room.

My mam's eye was swollen, black and bulging like a golf ball. Blood ran down her face coming from god knows where but it was everywhere, dad loomed over her like a predator his voice quiet and vile. An iron in his hand, the imprint of my mothers face dripping off it.

In my right mind, I'd think Dad probably should have turned it on as it would have done far more damage.

Then, he stormed out again. This time he was gone properly, shooting out the door and into the street. 

Mum sighed, exacerbated and clutching her nose.

"Rose hun go stick ya coat on but wait by the door, need a word with ya." I nodded and did as asked. The coat must have been two sizes down, when I put my arms up they were by my elbows and the welly boots  soles were still on the floor when I walked dragging them limply with each step. 

We stopped at the door, she knelt down to my eye level.

I didn't like it and looked down. We weren't equals, dad said so. She grasped my chin and lifted it up so I would be forced to meet her eye.

Mum cringed as she noticed my hood barely covered the back half of my head. 

"I'm sorry ya had to watch that honey." She lamented brushing a blonde lock from my face. "Ya deserve so much better, ya won't let anyone treat ya like that, will ya?" 

"Why?" I blinked at her, she looked as if she had been shot in the heart. "You let da' and he says to always listen to him." 

"No-no sweetheart, I should'n let ya da' do what he does. I'm very silly fer letting him like I have but the way he acts 'int right love." A range of things flashed across her face, I couldn't decipher a single one. 

"Yer da' woulda loved ya a bet." She said she she tenderly stroked my cheeked. "I don't think he does mam..." I replied sheepishly. 

A bitter look manifested and melted away instantly. "Not him sweet heart"

"I know..." She muttered after a moment of just looking at me, a slight sparkle in her eye. "Do ya wanna to meet ya gran?" 

"I have a gran?" I asked confused. She had never mentioned her. 

"Yeah, yeah ya do but we have'n spoken fer a bit. Would ya like to come with me to see her?" 

I considered it for a second before nodding. "An' Ollie too mam?" 

"Of course." She smiled a broken smile, blood stained her lip like lipstick and glass teeth were chipped from years of trauma.

We said our goodbyes and I skipped down the road to meet Lily and Boris. 

A single question permeated my usual indifference. 

When was the last time I had seen her smile?

I'd never get an answer, it was the last time I'd see her alive.



The rain hadn't let up all day, in classic British fashion, so by the time I reached my street I was absolutely drenched. 

The conversation with mam at the forefront of my mind. 

I ripped my leggings playing on the tires next to the mugger so I knew dad would have a fit with me again, he didn't often lay a finger on me of any kind, fatherly or otherwise though he seemed to get some kind of vindication when he did, often being in a far happier mood after slapping me. 

He never did it in front of my mother after the first time, he once told me girls were too uppity sometimes and he slapped me so I'd be a better girl than the little tarts at school. I didn't really understand what he meant but I got the sentiment of him trying to discipline me, not that I really knew what discipline meant but whatever. 

The door was unlocked so I clambered in, wiping my shoes and entering. 

It seemed as if my mam had skipped some of her chores. Clothes sat neatly piled on the setee but had not been taken upstairs, the washing up bowel was full but dirty plates and cups were strewn throughout the house. Ollie was still in the high chair, as if he hadn't been moved since this morning, crying with a stench of shite that dominated the senses. 

I found mam laid on the couch, her back to me. She was in a fetal position, I assumed she was stressed, worked up from the fight earlier. 

Dad was home, the unmistakable sound of his heavy footsteps thundering throughout the house, though the pace was surprising. It sounded as if he was in a rush. 

I changed Ollie's nappies, well tried too at least, it was messy and he looked sore from being forced to sit there in it. I carried him gently into the living room and approached my mam. 

"Mam! C'mon Ollie pooed himself an a dunno where the powder stuff is. Mam?" I tried but she wouldn't get up. I placed Ollie on the ugly chair in the corner, putting a pillow in place to stop him rolling off and returned to my mother's side. 

I grasped her shoulder. 

Something warms and wet squelched under my fingers. 

Retracting my hand, I found it crimson red like I had dipped it into paint. 

I flipped her over, her skin cold to the touch like refrigerated porcelain, her face frozen like a doll. It looked disturbed, scared. 

A large cut from between where her collar bones met, between her breasts down to her waist was a jagged cut, unneat and messy. Her fingernails jagged and broken, she had fought back. 

Despite all that, what I focused on the most, was her mouth. She had bit them, whoever had attacked her, teeth were broken and blood dried and crusted along on her lips. 

Deaths lipstick. 

I leaned forward, finger tracing the blood that caked her face. 

Then I felt it. 

A hand grasped my shoulder, rough, leathery and tight. I should have been scared but I wasn't, I don't think I could have been. 

I turned to see my dad staring down at me, eyes wide like dinner plates as he evaluated the scene. 

"What 're you doing here at this time? I thought you went to Lily's on Thursdays." He said surprisingly gently. 

I shrugged noncommittally. "'Ant done that since ya socked her da'."

He hummed in acknowledgment staring at my mam. 

An idea flickered in his eyes. 

I signed, he was going to ask me to tidy up. 

"Do ya mind cleaning in here. I gotta take ya mam to the hospital, she's hurt herself." He told me. 

My brows furrowed. "She hurt herself?" 

"Yeah, like you used to remember?" 

I though back to my old habit. "She likes biting things too?" 

"Yeah, loved it but she did what she said you shouldn't did'n she? Silly woman could'n follow her own advice could she? Did something very silly" He spoke to me as if I was an invalid, each word slow and deliberate. 

"Very silly." I replied looking at the cut down her chest. His hand grasped my chin, turning me to look at him. It was then I noticed the blood that trailed down the back of his neck and the dark blotches on his hands.

"You better not be silly now, when I come back I want it to be spick and span in here. If you do...we'll go out, get summat to eat, yeah?" I nodded. "Good girl, off you pop then, get to it." 

He bundled mum up in blankets like a gift to god before disappearing into the cellar. 

I went over to Ollie, lifting him into my arms. 

"Got a lot to do, haven't we mate?" I asked him and he just stared at the scene in front of us innocently. 



It was hard to clean, blood had seemingly seeped into all of our furniture and carpet, staining like wine. I tried everything, mop, sponge, vacuum cleaner none of it worked. Dad came up halfway through asking for his buzz saw. 

I had given Ollie a brush to help clean but he ended up smacking himself in the head with the bristles. 

By tea time dad had apparently taken mum to the hospital despite never leaving the cellar, I didn't question it, and took a seat where mum had been laid, cracked open some stellar and turned on the tele. After a few short minutes he sighed and went up to his room.

I was nearly done, a spot on the carpet was being difficult. Dad eventually returned in new clothes, rifling my hair before helping me with the last of the mess. 

We had McDonald's. 

It was a good day.



Mam had been gone for two years.
Slowly at first but by the time I turned nine all her chores were mine. Both myself and Ollie were my responsibility, dad said it was because he was the 'breadwinner' whatever that meant. 

It felt like she had handed me her duties, I didn't know how to feel about it at the time.

My birthday was as always a quiet affair, dad didn't bother to acknowledge it but Ollie had woken me early to give me a card he'd made in nursery. Anyone else's kid I'd have pointed out the fact it was like 90% the teacher but I was over the moon so let it slide.

Dad scratched his arse as he stomped in, burping, he put a leathery hand on my shoulder and removed me from the fridge so he could grab a can of stellar. I resumed making Ollie's meal confused at the early start but I made no effort to challenge him.

I was about to get changed when he grabbed me by the arm.

"Ya not goin' to school." He droned as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.

"Why?" I asked confused, cocking my head to the side.

"'Cause I fuckin said so, that not enough for ya?" He barked. "If it was up to me you'd never a gone, none a your lot woulda! Been better off at home anyway." He gestured at my chest for some reason.

I was bemused at his rant but shrugged. "What about Ollie?"

"Take Tike later, he doesn't start 'till twelve."

I nodded and started my chores. For some reason it seemed like I caught his eye a lot more that day, especially as he got tipsy before I took Ollie to school. The teachers were confused at me being the one to bring him in but made little effort to look into it. When I got back he disappeared, no note or anything just an empty house and the thick smell of alcohol in the air.

Exhausted, I figured I could get a few winks in before going back for Ollie. 

As sleep wrapped me in a warm comforting embrace, a sound not distant but not close either began to blow into my room. It was chatter, a kind of rhythmic 'tack' sound that quickly began to grate.

I turned over electing to ignore it.

Closer now, though I still tried to ignore it something panged in my stomach.

What the hell was it?

Outside my room now, since mam left I had felt like a grown up, trusted with all kinds of jobs but in that moment I felt about Ollie's age.

I buried my head under the covers.
The door didn't open, it didn't matter, whatever was making the noise was in my room. 

Immediately, the temperature dropped. 

A weight pressed down on my bed inbetween my feet, slowly they eased over me, a hand pressed next to my head.

I was ready to scream.

Slowly, cautiously, gently I dragged the covers down from my face.

I don't know what I hoped it was, my dad would hardley have been comforting but anything else was unimaginable to my young mind.

It was mam.

At least it looked that way at first, but she didn't look quite right. Like the last time I saw her, her lips were scarlet with blood but unlike then her skin was sickly pale, her hair slightly ginger when it should have been more blonde like mine. Her eyebrow crooked and misshapen lifted as she looked at me. The source of the noise was obvious, her mouth hung disjointed from her face, her lower jaw hanging as if broken but it repeatedly bounced up and down like a yoyo cracking with the upper teeth mechanically. Investigating further it was obvious she had gnawed through her tongue which was missing the tip.

A chunk of tooth landed on my nose.

I'd never screamed before, in that moment I more than made up for it.

When I opened my eyes she was gone, a nightmare then...it had to be. Right?

The blood stain shaped like a hand next to my head suggested differently.

I never told a soul, no matter how many times I saw it.


 
Weeks after the first sighting of what appeared to be my mother, I adapted to her presence. It became abundantly clear I was the only one who could see her, or at least the only one who was disturbed by her, which would be a first.

Sometimes I'd bump into her while cooking, she'd make no effort to hurt me or anything. Nor would she communicate either though I tried. Everytime I got close to regaining my composure it would do something to put me on the back foot. For example as far as I knew it couldn't touch anything, I assumed she was a ghost or something, only for her to knock my dad's beer on the floor.

That had gotten me a strange punishment, dad was high at the time and so I expected the punishment to be unorthodox, I didn't expect him to make me sit on the couch next to him until he could put out his cigar on my tongue. He watched me the whole time, his eyes never met my own though, I squirmed uncomfortably under his scrutiny. Funnily enough it was the closest we had been in a long time.

Mam watched coldly.

It couldn't be her, she'd never look at him like that.

She wouldn't get me in trouble like that...

By the time the month came to an end I was at my wits end. Dad had gone to 'work', also known as gambling mam's life insurance, when I blew up at the ghost.

"What the fuck ya want from me?" She said nothing in response. "Leave me alone!"

This seemed to spur her into action, slowly she trailed to the cellar door pointing at it. Usually she would just apparate around the room, thinking back on it was the only time I saw her move on her two feet. It was no wonder, every step seemed painful her legs were thin bony twigs that would snap under any amount of weight.

Reluctantly, I followed.

Me and the cellar had a funny relationship, by funny I mean everything in it wanted to kill me. 

Everytime I went in something would fall, collapse or just straight up explode leaving me injured or centimetres from death. At the same time it smelled divine, about eight air freshners were constantly pumping something into the air, an undercurrent of something beneath them. It was repugnant but sweet, like trusting iron and rotting chicken.

Dad said it was mold.

The steps were rickety, old wet wood crumbling at the edges, which creaked as I descended. Yellow light made the fresh white walls look piss yellow. Mam was unconcerned with my trepidation pointed at some bin bags in the corner.

Uncomfortable, I grabbed a pair of shears and poked the bag. A rat scampered out from behind the large black bags, I was in a half mind to abandon whatever this was so I could go experiment on it in my room like my neighbours cat, looking at my ghostly mothers dead eyes made me reconsider.

Cringing, I put the idea on the back burner and got closer to the bags.

Slowly, I pulled the bag open slightly.

I gasped.

My mothers head, frozen in a never ending scream lay at the top. Her eyes like rotten grapes went brown and black, her teeth yellow as the walls and her hair missing clumps and wilting.

I know how I should have felt, at least now I do...at the time I couldn't help the little smile that pulled at my lips. In a way she looked beautiful, in a disgusting sort of way.

What caught my attention the most however was certainly unexpected.
A bite mark, one I now know was post mortem.

Something about it, made my stomach churn like a washing machine.

Why?

It was all I could think.

Why...that?

Just because she tried it when trying to escape, when she had no choice, when she was powerless?

Suddenly, the smell was too much. It was revolting, I never wanted to come down here again. I gipped a little in my mouth before racing up the stairs and to the bathroom. At every turn the ghost was there, but it looked different everytime. I saw several women, none I recognised except my mother, and just willed them to go away.

I begged them silently in my mind to leave me alone.

They did.

I never saw them again.

Not even my mother.

I showered after, I still don't think I'm clean enough.



It was a bad night.

A really fucking bad night.

The worst in a long time.

I had been helping Ollie with his ABC's when dad thundered in, he barked all kinds of order but none made any sense. Clearly, energy drinks and vodka were a bad combo.
While dad shit everything he had ever eaten into our toilet bowel Ollie turned to me.

"Why's Da' not like ya?" He asked as I tried to remember a word beginning with Q.

"What makes ya say that" I asked relatively uninterested. His feeling were reciprocated after all.

"Calls ya mean names n' that all the time...called ya a slag Monday." He murmured.

The word held little significance for me, though apparently it was one of my first words so that was something.

"Dunno, not bothered honestly. Kiss my arse can't he? Knobhead..." I muttered darkly.

It was then he stumbled out of the toilet, his trousers discarded and his underwear caked in shit. Genuinely, the most fun I ever had with him as I watched him hobble into his room like a penguin.

We got to the end of Ollie's homework by the time he tumbled into the living room. Clumsily, he smashed his knee into the setee and landed on Ollie's knee.

I went still as I watched, something poking at my stomach.

Ollie had begun to whinge. Dad huffed and planted himself on the couch with a huff nursing a cold one.

Ollie continued crying.

It was soft at first, a little cry here or there but after a few more minutes it became constant. 

Dad got fed up quickly. 

"The fuck are you crying for?" He snapped. Ollie didn't respond and continued crying. Dad tried to ignore it but quickly grew angrier and angrier. 

"The hell do you want?" He all but screamed as he launched up and towards the tiny child. 

Something inside me snapped, a sensation I'f only felt once before. It was hot, bubbling, sensation that crawled up from my stomach and into my throat tasting acidic, almost like vomiting after being punched in the gut. 

"Leave him alone!" I screeched, barreling towards them. Dad looked absolutely gobsmacked. I'd never so much as told him I wouldn't eat something before never mind yell at him. 

His face flickered through a range of expressions before settling on authoritative. "Excuse me?" 

"Ollie's hungry no need to be mean." I told him rather bossily. 

He grabbed my hair and yanked me towards him, the stench of alcohol evident on his breath. Any distance between us was closed, his hot manky breath was enough to get me a little tipsy, his pig looking face was pinched in frustration, his skin as oily as a chip pan dripped onto his 'nice shirt' and his grey tangled hair hung over his left eye. I didn't know if he was going to punch or devour me with his fat cake hole.

The look in his eye frightened me.

I'd seen it in the mirror.

Without warning, his flabby arms plucked me from my place on the carpet and suspended me in mid air. The suddenness caught me off guard, then he began to squeeze.

It was the closest thing to a hug he had ever given me.

Somewhere in my body something creaked, cracked and then snapped.

I began to scream.

Ollie rushed forward, even as young as he was he knew he had to try. It mattered little, he was too small, so was I.

Something primal sparked in my mind, desperate and dangerous. I had to get out, it wasn't a question of if. I began thrashing in his arms, scratching, punching and kicking did little. Nothing could pull back enough to build up momentum, nothing hurt his inebriated body.

He gave another squeeze and I coughed blood.

Darkness crept into my vision.

I couldn't breath.

I thought about my mother, the ghost, the body in the cellar. I caught a glimpse of the back of his neck. A circular scar popping against his red skin.

The bite mark.

I thought about it every night, wondering why.

Now I knew. At least why it mattered to me in this moment.

I leaned forward and sank my teeth into his oesophagus. Surprised, he dropped me and therefore sealing his fate. I was small, smaller than most my age but with gravity on my side it didn't matter. His throat began to tear, his scream turned into a gurgle as a sound like tearing wet cloth echoed in the room.

He slumped onto his knees, blood spurting from his neck like a chocolate fountain. His chubby hands clutched at flesh that wasn't there, his eyes slowly glazed over. We fell together, his fat carcass crushing me into the vibrant red carpet.

His gob opened and closed as his life dripped onto my face, his last breath being the first I'd taken in over a minute.

It felt like the first breath of my life.

I grinned as I tried to work my way free, because I was free. He was dead, I wasn't. A bird without a cage, I could spread my wings. Ollie stood slack jawed, unable to voice what he wanted. I knew what he was going to say anyway, I trotted over and wrapped him in a hug. Briefly, I kissed him on the cheek, smearing blood on him like lipstick.

I felt so grown up.

Our neighbours certainly got a shock when we arrived on their door step, covered in blood with very different looks on our faces.
 

 
Ollie doesn't remember that night, or at least he pretends not to. It doesn't matter, I do. When they put us in the home I was immediately irate. I was in charge, not them...Ollie was safe with me. People in charge always hurt you, so I have to be in charge so I can hurt them first.

They gave us new parents.

I despised my new dad. Just like the old one except he was convinced he could do it all on his own. Fucker tried to pamper me, make me breakfast in the morning or take Ollie to school. Those were my jobs, he was taking the only power I had.

He wouldn't have authority over me, he'd never.

I got my chance at christmas, he was diabetic you see. An easy target at the right time. When he collapsed at the table, honestly I didn't get the panic. Any old idiot would know, go get the EpiPen when he collapsed.

Ollie's face made me pause.

Worry was etched into his face, a terror I hadn't seen since dad.
I got the EpiPen, weighed it in my hand.

Originally, I planned to hide it. Let him die there on the floor, helpless and pathetically panting.

Just like dad, he had no power over me when dead.

It was always Ollie that made me reconsider these things. When I found the stray cat, instead of skinning it he made me keep it. Mr mittens had become one of my little people along with Ollie and his little friend at school.

Would it be like when dad died?

When he shut down...when he wouldn't speak to me?

That wouldn't do at all.

I gave the prick his EpiPen, it turned out well enough. They stopped babying me so much, called me a "big girl" which I'm ashamed to admit gave me butterflies.

I tried to stop those habits and thoughts I knew would get me in trouble...really I did! Leaving animals alone was hard but I managed. A nasty habit of biting people popped up and I got given a rubber band to snap on my wrist if I ever got the urge.

One thing I never got over was 'not respecting my seniors' as the headteacher ruled one day. But, I hadn't killed any of them. God I thought about it though, making them helpless before ripping out their voice. You can't tell anyone what to do without your voice.

I told myself I wouldn't, for Ollie.

I'm trying so hard, I bite my own arm but it's not the same.



A boy asked me out the other day, it's not happened before. Most would be over the moon, I was more annoyed he'd asked me in public, pressured me into saying yes.

He asked me.

ME!

I ranted to Ollie, he just shrugged.

I'm overreacting, of course I am.

If he thinks he can tell me what to do...

I'm trying, okay?

I'm trying...
