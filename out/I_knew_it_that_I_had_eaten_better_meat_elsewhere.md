Hello, for most of my life I have been able to only see at 15% of what a normal person does. I try to not let my problem define my life but obviously it does have a serious effect on my everyday life. I have worked as a shop clerk for the last ten years in a small store near my house so I don't have to cross many streets to get there.

In that very store I met my best friend Ryan. Ryan is a guy 3 years younger than me who really likes helping people out. This is probably why he hangs out with me and to be honest you really have to admire his patience every time he has to cross a street with me. 

In the last years I have been dependant on him to help me in some aspects of life but I think that I could really get by without him. He always jokes saying that I wouldn't even be able to go to the dentist without him but I find these jokes quite unfunny.

Last week the small store that me and ryan worked in sadly closed and we got laid off. I had to find a new job, preferably with my best friend so that we can go there together and not risk getting hit by a car or something worse. It is really hard for people like me finding jobs due to my vision problem but fortunately a great solution came quickly.

My friend found that a local butcherhouse needed staff to carry things around. We reached them separately and to my surprise they were rager to hire me even though I had a vision problem. My friend also got hired  and was told to help me out if I ever needed anything

The following days however were a little weird. Ryan found a girlfriend with whom he grew very close very quickly. Who would have imagined that in just one month they passed an engagement ring through each other's fingers. It was weird knowing my friend wore that ring. Ryan hated jewelry and he never wore any. He had told me that it had a very beautiful stone on it with a bright red colour. I joked that it was such a feminine ring but he answered me back laughing: "like you could see it".

Apart from that, my job was going great. Ryan would drive me everyday to the butcherhouse were me and him would go alone to the freezer and carry the dead cows to a truck. The owner who was a very friendly guy always told us that the meat we were carrying had the best quality in the whole Mediterranean but I always told him that I surely had eaten better elsewhere.

One day ryan came to me saying that he was short on money and if I could lend him some. Obviously I was tight on money and proposed to him to perhaps sell his ring and by a new cheaper one. That was when he got extremely angry with me and gold me to fuck off. I believe that he was drunk at that time.

Later that evening I learnt that a robery happened in the butcher house we worked in. I immediately realised that it was Ryan trying to steal with the little key the owner gave us to unlock the freezer. The news said that the criminals had not been found.

I hadn't heard from him for two weeks. I continiued to go to work on my own. It was hard but I managed. His fianc√© every day asked me if he had contacted me in any way but sadly he never did. I had to continue my life and to be honestly after what he said to me when I refused to lend him money I didn't really trust him.

Christmas came and the owner of the butcherhouse told me that he would gift me a whole cow for a gift because even though I was practically blind I continued to be a hard worker and never giving up. 

The same day when I got home and opened the tv I heard that the butcherhouse owner were a robery took place was actually a huge mafia boss who had killed multiple people. I was very surprised as he seemed like a nice guy. I thought to my mind "what a crazy world we live in" as I bit down and chewed on the meat he had given me and to my surprise it was absolutely amazing. Indeed the best I had eaten. I took a second bite which wad also amazing. Savoury, juicy and full of taste. However on the third bite I bit something hard and metallic. Weirdly shaped, just like a ring. Ahh I broke my tooth and how am I supposed to go to the dentist without Ryan?
