I don’t really know where to start.
My name is Mark. Six months ago, my wife, Sarah, died in a car accident. It’s just me and my six-year-old daughter, Lily, now. The pain is something I can’t even put into words—but I have to stay strong for her.

Three weeks ago, we moved. Far away from everything. I thought a fresh start would help. We found this old wooden house in a quiet little town in rural Massachusetts. Big, creaky floors, drafty windows that whistle when the wind picks up… the whole vintage package. At first, I thought it was charming. Now, I’m not so sure.

It started the very first night. I tucked Lily into her new bed. She was quiet, holding the stuffed bunny Sarah gave her. I kissed her on the forehead, and as I was walking out, she called to me in that small, soft voice kids have.

“Daddy?”
“Yes, sweetheart?”
“Mommy’s cold. She’s under the bed.”

My heart stopped for a second. We’ve been seeing a therapist, who told me Lily might express her grief through fantasies, even imagine things to cope. So I took a breath, knelt down beside her bed, and smiled.

“Honey, Mommy’s in heaven, remember? She’s a star up there, watching over you.”
Lily slowly shook her head. “No. She’s here. Under the bed. She’s whispering.”

Of course, I looked. I grabbed my phone’s flashlight, got down on the cold wooden floor, and shined it under the bed. Dust, a few cobwebs… nothing else. I showed her.
“See? Nobody here. Now get some sleep, okay?”

She didn’t look convinced, but she nodded.

This kept happening every night.
“Mommy’s thirsty, Daddy.”
“Mommy sang to me today.”
“Mommy said she doesn’t like your blue jacket.”
Every time, I patiently explained, checked under the bed, and tried to be the rational, comforting dad.

But tonight… tonight everything changed.
I’m locked in my room right now, holding my breath as I type this. Someone needs to read this. Someone needs to know.

It started maybe two hours ago. I heard Lily talking in her room. That’s not unusual—kids talk to themselves. But this was different. She was pausing between sentences. Like she was answering someone.

“…and then the squirrel ran up the tree,” she said. After about five seconds of silence, she replied, “No, it didn’t hurt. He was fast.” Then a little giggle. “You’re tickling me.”

The hairs on my arms stood up. I called her name softly and opened the door. She was sitting on her bed, staring at empty space.

“Who are you talking to, honey?”
“Mommy,” she said, in the most matter-of-fact way. “She was telling me a story.”

That’s when I heard it.
A scratch. Faint, but unmistakable. Coming from under her bed. Like fingernails on old wood. Lily didn’t even flinch.

“Mommy said hi,” she whispered, smiling at me.

My blood went cold. I forced myself to look under the bed again with the flashlight. Nothing. Just darkness and dust. But as I stood up, I felt this freezing chill radiating from that space—unnaturally cold, like someone had opened a freezer door.

I told Lily to go to sleep, closed her door, and stood in the hallway. That’s when the scratching came back, louder this time.
Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.

Then it stopped. And I heard something new coming from the baby monitor in my pocket. A soft whispering, like static with a rhythm. I turned the volume up, and my stomach dropped.

The static started forming a lullaby. The same one Sarah used to sing to Lily every night—Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.
But it was wrong. Slower. Off-key. The voice sounded like a warped, broken recording of my wife.

I ran back into Lily’s room, throwing the door open. The sound cut off instantly. She looked like she was asleep, but the air was heavy and freezing, carrying this sickly sweet smell—like flowers rotting in water.

That’s when I saw it. On the floor next to her bed: a little toy teacup filled with water and a cookie on a plate.

“It’s for Mommy,” she murmured when I touched her shoulder, half asleep. “She said she was thirsty.”

I threw it away, shaking, and stepped back into the hallway. The silence that followed was almost worse than the sound. Then the monitor crackled again.

This time, it spoke. One word.
“Mark.”

Clear as day. In a deep, rasping voice that wasn’t human.

It came from inside Lily’s room.

I rushed in. She was sitting up in bed, facing away from me, staring at the dark space beneath the bed.

“Lily?” My voice cracked.

She slowly turned around. Her face was pale, her eyes wide with absolute terror.
“Daddy…” she whimpered. “Mommy’s mad.”

Then, something moved under the bed.
Not scratching—slamming. The entire bed jerked a few inches to the side with a heavy THUD.

I didn’t think. I grabbed Lily and ran to my room across the hall. Locked the door. Shoved a dresser against it.

And that’s where we are now. She’s in my lap, still sobbing. I can hear it in the hallway—a dragging sound. Slow. Heavy. Like something long being pulled across the wooden floor.
Shhhhh… arrrr… shhhhh…

And that voice. That horrible voice. Whispering just outside the door.

“Let… her… back…”

It’s not Sarah. Whatever it is, it’s not my wife.

The sound stopped right in front of us. The doorknob is rattling. Click, click, click. The dresser shakes with every hit.

Lily suddenly stopped crying. She’s completely still in my arms, staring at the door.

“Daddy,” she whispered, so softly I almost didn’t catch it.
“Yes, baby, Daddy’s here. It’s going to be okay.”
“It’s not Mommy under the bed.”

I froze. “What do you mean, sweetheart?”

She lifted her trembling little arm and pointed—not at the door—but at the dark corner of my room. Under my bed.

“Mommy’s there,” she said. “She’s hiding from the other thing.”

A loud crack. The wood around the doorframe is splitting.

Oh God. There’s something in my room. It’s been here the whole time. The thing in the hallway was a distraction.

I can hear it breathing. Wet. Ragged. From the darkness near the floor.

Lily’s looking over my shoulder now, tears in her eyes.

“Hi, Mommy,” she whispers.

The door explodes into splinters.
