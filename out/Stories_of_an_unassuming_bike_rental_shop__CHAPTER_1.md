  


Strange lights dance before my eyes, I can almost make out shapes, here; an 8-ball, a human face, a prancing dog. But as soon as my eyes try to focus on them, they become formless lights again. I can feel the presence behind me, whispering eldritch truths. The problem with those is a normal dude like me can’t understand them. So I just tune out the unknowable speech until it’s nothing more than white noise as I gaze upon the lights slowly drifting above the abyss. I’ve been having this dream often recently, I realize. Not my first recurring oniric journey by far, but I’m more used to the “classroom shame” type, though even these ones get weird, like that one time I spat out hundreds of live eels and they started flying,.. but that’s neither here nor there. Gripping my thoughts tighter, I gaze down at the hungering abyss below the lights and feel a shudder pass, better to keep on the lights then. And so i drift and the lights keep gently soothing me and they dance and dance and dance and dance-



I wake with a jolt at my alarm, you know the one, the annoying Iphone one everyone has heard at least once and hates. I keep it because of that hate though, it’s what gets me to wake up to turn it off, it’s what fuels me to forge on ahead with my day, to prove the smug alarm wrong, that I do have my life together, even if it’s wishful thinking. Morning preparations pass in a blur, at some points routine becomes so numb you start doing them without realizing, like when I leave my room with the blinds open, and come back to them close, i just do it without realizing it. It’s 7:03 by the time I’m done, not my best time, but not my worst by far, I’ll be 30 minutes early today, but that’s nothing new. 



The ride on the metro always feels like a second dream, the darkness of the underground and the few dim lights on the tunnel walls blending to create this weird hazy atmosphere. The people all present in a small spot, doing nothing, yet somehow so far from each other, each one in their own little pocket of reality, barely aware of each other. Yet I watch them, not intently, no more than one sweep of my eyes per person, but that feeling of surveying the people as they are in their bubble in this public space that feels more private than many fills me with a confidence, a form of understanding of my own reality by watching others.



 Lost in thought, I almost miss my stop, but a well timed gaze of the wall shows me we’ve arrived, “The Weapons Palace”, always so ominous with the towering justice building leading to the port. As usual, it takes me 5 to 7 minutes to make my way from the palace down to the Old Port, a place of wonder and horror all the like. At least in the morning there aren't too many weird happenings, but I still take my precautions and avoid the dim lit alleys that appear invitingly as shortcuts. Sure it makes the trip longer, but it’s a cost I’m more than willing to pay after what happened last Summer. 



I suppose now’s as good a time as any to give a small explanation of my job and place of employment, as I sit on the ancient stone stairs and wait for my coworkers on my phone. I’m an intendant (a rather dull title that in actuality represents a whole lot of responsibilities) for the City’s best (and only easily accessible to the uncommon mortal or not) bike rental shop! Come on Mondays for 25% off! Don’t ask why, no, there’s nothing weird going on at the Island on Monday, just don’t go there okay. Alright, promotions aside, it’s a pretty amazing job, most of it is moving bikes from the front shop to our little plot of land on the port, and talking to customers, which are typically tourists from all over the world! Sometimes they’re from places I've never even heard about, and I had a history major in high school. 



So anyways, I’ll keep you guys posted with interesting stuff that happens at work during my breaks. There’s already quite a backlog of fun stories I want to share, so most of these will be in the past, but I'll still write them in the present for the sake of clarity. 

  


**CHAPTER 1: A HOT DAY AND WORKING IN THE BASEMENT**

The heat today might just kill me. That and the sounds from the Basement. Truly a pick your poison type of situation: scorch under the City’s strange sun that burns and summons rain at a moment’s notice with no clouds; or toil in the Basement and be subject to its sounds that feel like nails on a chalkboard, it’s many tripping hazards, it’s ceiling so low i have to be almost crouching, and that’s not to mention the unknown of its too many hallways and how it’s somehow way bigger than the building it’s sitting under. 



Well, there’s some small graces, I don’t have to make that choice today; Manager just told me I’ll have to do a bit of both today. 



As I walk back inside the smooth air conditioned interior of our shop, I spot today’s Manager leaning on the counter. He’s a brown haired, short and hunched, 30-something year old man, with a face full of faults; crooked teeth, long nose, uneven chin. And yet, he always has this air upon him that makes him striking. Shrinking back with dread (which is a comical image if you can picture that he’s almost half my height) I dare ask “Is the Owner here today?”. 



As the quickly stammered out words leave my lips before I can think better of it, the air itself seems to still, the entire store seems too quiet, even the usual clanking of the Mechanic’s workshop we typically hear faintly is eerily absent. The Manager turns his slightly crossed eyes to me, his uneven gaze managing to still be searing. He rasps under his breath “He won’t be here this week, but keep your tongue to yourself, boy.” and gives a pointed look to the general direction of the glinting of one of the many hidden cameras. 

I know they can’t detect sound, but a chill nonetheless passes through me despite the scalding heat outside at the idea that He could very well be watching right now. Deciding to try and move on, I ask “So, what are we guys to do with all that heat today”, “Well, he says, we aren’t getting customers for another half hour, so why don’t you guys grab extra bikes from under and bring them to our plot while I sort out our overdue paperwork?”.



 Knowing better than to ask for another assignment, I give a curt nod and make my way to the Basement, knowing damn well than despite there being 3 other intendants here with me today, I’ll have to be the one to go down there, “you’re the one who can weather it the best after all”, they’ll say.

So I grimly make my way through our store, first through our long customer service section with its gleaming metal counters and many maps of the shifting lanes of the City. Then through our products section where we keep a handful of bike products in the event of a non client needing them and walks by our store (happens more than you’d think). Then I pass in front of the workshop, making sure not to actually set foot in the place since today the one holding the shift is the old Hob faced one, and I’d find myself with a wrench thrown at me full force if I did get too close to the forges. 



Finally, after what feels like an eternity, I arrive at the very back of our store, where there’s old rusted lift to get heavy objects down into and from the basement, the little staircase that’s so narrow you can barely fit through it, and the employee room and kitchen to either sides of the instalment. I stop by to take a sip of coffee, a nice reminder of the cleverness of the Owner’s design for the shop; by placing the break room and kitchen right next to the Basement’s entrance, he’d ensured that we would only go there for our actual breaks or in cases of true need. Anyways, enough stalling. Setting one unsure foot on the first small wooden step of the staircase, I inhale deeply, then take the plunge.



The atmosphere in the basement always hits you in parts. First, there’s the strange, almost comforting, feel of stillness. You know the old attic at your grandparent’s place, with dim orange light going through the cracks in the roof, and dust particles being visible through the beams of light? It feels like that, even though there’s no luminous beams nor dust clouds. Yet there’s this feeling, this strange moment where you think everything has gone still, that the world itself is catching its breath, as you first enter the Basement.



 And then there’s the second part; mystery. Many things don’t make sense in this shop, Heck, many things don’t make sense in this City. But there’s something about the Basement that always strikes out when you enter, even if you’ve never been in it before. How it’s definitely bigger than the building that sits above it, despite all logic making you think you’d be under the river only a couple of steps into it. How there’s an unknown amount of hallways twisting out from the main shape of the place. How you can find seemingly anything you could be looking for, except water.



The third part is always the worst, the sound. It doesn’t necessarily happen right after the first two parts. Sometimes you spend tens of minutes in the Basement before it happens. Sometimes you do whatever you need to do and exit and it doesn’t even show up. But it always comes back, and you never expect it. Today it hit me mere seconds after getting my bearings in the dim lit environment. The loud, indescribable blaring that seems to come from all around you, and deep from your bones at the same time. I’ve heard people argue over what it is and what it sounds like a lot more than you’d think. To some, it is akin to being right next to one of those large cargo ships foghorn as it goes off. To others, they swear it’s the sound of a nuclear siren. The only thing we all agree on is that it rattles you to your very core whenever it catches you. And it does, always. And there’s the other half of the sound, the somehow even less sensible one; the images. The sheer brutality of the sound seems to every time, no matter what or who, fill the person’s head with images of flesh, of meat, of skin.



There are benefits to being sent here though. First is the most obvious; since no one else, not even the managers, wants to be here if they can help it, that usually means I’ll be nice and alone down here. And the lack of a camera means that working in the Basement is primo time to be on my phone and write more of this. Of course I need to keep an eye on the time to not be suspicious, but I’m used to that. The other, more subtle benefit, is the stillness I mentioned before. Of course this is dependent on the raking and clanking being absent, but even when it appears, it usually fades in a few minutes. To be more precise, being alone in the basement feels the same as what most people I imagine feel in their own bedrooms. A feeling of security and privacy, of being able to be truly yourself without anyone to judge. It’s nice.



So, phone in hand and writing more of this as I go, I advance further in the liminal space. Passing by many branching corridors I’ve never seen before, I try to stay focused on my goal. Which, writing this, now would be a good time as any to explain why I’m down here today in the first place. The manager earlier didn’t see fit to explain it, as it was quite obvious (to me). You see, on particularly hot days like these, we often run out of bikes in the front shop at midday at best. So my current goal is to locate some extra large men’s bikes, and small women’s bikes, as those two are the ones we run out of the fastest. Thankfully the basement appears to contain anything and everything you could be looking for, as long as it’s not water.



I reach the first threshold, a small door full of holes, with a red “EXIT” glowing sign above it. All the employees know it doesn’t actually lead to an exit, and the long, winding and dark corridor visible through the holes is hopefully hint enough for anyone who *doesn’t* know.

Thankfully, I spotted a large rack of bikes to my left. I don’t have to risk a threshold today after all. Peering at the bikes neatly arranged, I manage to locate two extra larges, and a small. Great, now to get them off. You have to understand that with the sheer amount of bikes we have, they have to be \*extremely\* tightly arranged if we are to hold them all in. Now, my best friend, who is working on buying the shop from The Owner (but that’s a whole other can of worms for another day) is keen on selling a ton of them to save space, but that’s neither here, nor there. 

Meaning i have to move approximately a dozen bikes just to get the three i’m looking for. Right. 

Well, you get used to it.



It’s been a bit. Climbing back onto the large rusted metal cargo elevator with the bikes in tow, I grab the bright yellow control remote, a stark contrast to the damp darkness of the basement. The thrum of machinery around me rattles as the contraption begins its slow ascent back to a more civilized world. It’s funny how in any other context in this city, underground is synonymous to security, to peace. But in this shop, it’s a dreaded concept. What I'm trying to say is the actual transit period between below and aboveground is easily my favourite thing about the Basement. It’s this sort of quiet, in between, moment (despite the clicking and clanking noise) where everything seems suspended. Nothing really matters, all I’m doing is pressing the remote and holding the bikes so they don’t fall off in the deep below. There’s a beauty to that, I believe.



Alright, now that I’ve done the work, it’s time to do the work. You might think I’m joking, or making a pun, but anyone who’s ever worked in retail will tell you there’s always something to do. No matter what. Honestly I think there might even be some twisted divine game to that. Anyways, to sound less cryptic it just means I need to actually sort the bikes now. Bringing them to the front of the store, I give a jolly little middle finger to the manager, who responds with two of his own. That’s one of the things I truly enjoy about this job, the lightness of the tone, it probably helps that my best friend since middle school works here too, though to do him justice I will try not to talk too much about him until I give him a whole chapter of his own.



Anyways, to the more pressing matter at hand, I make my way to the clients who were waiting for their bikes the whole time. I hand them the goods, apologizing in the way we retail workers do: “I’m so sorry that the thing out of my control made you have to wait longer”. I obviously don’t word it that way, but that’s how it is. The clients’ sort of opaque eyes seem unfocused, and they give me a very half-assed response in their broken English. They’re the annoying type who speak none of the City’s official languages, and barely hold their own in american english, so working with them feels almost like working as an interpreter too. I never know where they come from, their accent is unrecognizable, their face unremarkable, and their native language unknown. So I don't feel too bad about them having to wait, after all, I had to wait for them to understand our system and make proper requests.



The rest of the day after this was pretty empty, some new clients here and there, but nothing too different from anything I’ve described so far, so I think I’ll just end this chapter here. If you guys have any questions about my work or this City I’d love to try and tackle them in Chapter 2, in the meantime I’m working on an interlude that will cover a different piece of my story.
