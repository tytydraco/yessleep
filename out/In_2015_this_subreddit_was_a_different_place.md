Be glad that one user, in particular, no longer interacts with posts.

But know that he *definitely* still visits us.

I was 20 years old, riddled with undiagnosed depression, and trapped in a university course that I detested. Life looked dismal. But I didn’t know what a *truly* dismal life could be. My real suffering started on r/nosleep.

To maintain anonymity, I’ve changed the names of all involved.

“People post horrifying stories on there,” Gemma gushed. “You should read some.”

“I don’t find creepypastas scary anymore,” I said.

“No, it’s not that kind of site!” My housemate insisted. “People post real stories.”

At first, I had little interest in visiting this subreddit. I had little interest in anything. For the sake of putting an end to my friend’s badgering, however, I begrudgingly browsed the subreddit. And my life changed, as I know it did for all of us. The posts I found were beyond horrific. Raw, real-life tales of terror. I didn’t even *use* Reddit before I visited this subreddit. This twisted library of ill-fated journeys.

And I have one to join the collection, but it’s taken me nearly 9 years to open up.

My story began with an addiction. An adoration of this place. I know that’s a sinister thing to say, given the subject nature of people’s posts, but why are any of us here? Why are you here? Well, if you want a sickening story, you’ve come to the right Reddit post.

*Let’s find that monster and teach him a lesson.*

That was my brief, asinine comment on a long-gone nosleep story about a woman’s stalker. Less than a minute after I submitted the comment, a message request appeared in my inbox.

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: Do you need my help?*

I raised an eyebrow and made the first mistake of many — responding.

*Theeaglestrikes: Are you responding to my nosleep comment?*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: Yes.*

*Theeaglestrikes: Mark sounded like a monster. I’m glad OP made it out alive.*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: You have good morals, Eagle. Such a rare thing to find in this corner of the internet. Shall we do it?*

*Theeaglestrikes: Do what?*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: Find him.*

*Theeaglestrikes: Mark? Have you messaged OP or something?*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: No. I’m just good at finding things.*

*Theeaglestrikes: Listen, I was only joking. How would we even find him?*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: I don’t know, Austin. How would we?*

“WHAT THE–” I started to yell, immediately clasping my mouth.

It was three in the morning, and I didn't want to wake my flatmates. But the internet stranger had just used a name that wasn’t on my profile. Sitting in my unlit room, eyes strained by a blinding phone screen, I became all-too-aware of the silent road on which I lived. The tuneless singing of tipsy students sounded in the far distance. But I still felt alone. Discomforted.

*Theeaglestrikes: How do you know my name? I don’t have any personal information on this account.*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: Relax, Austin. No need for hostility. I just wanted to show you what I could do. My name’s Carl. Does that make you feel better?*

*Theeaglestrikes: No, Carl. It fucking does not.*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: To earn your trust, I’ll take the lead on this one. Do you think Mark has large lungs?*

Deeply unsettled, I slid the phone under my pillow, squeezed my eyelids shut, and lay awake. My heart was still pounding rapidly when my alarm sounded at seven in the morning. I hadn’t slept.

“You looked tired,” Gemma said, as we stepped onto the bus.

“Thanks,” I groaned, rubbing my eyes. “I wish you’d never told me about nosleep.”

My flatmate laughed. “You’re not supposed to take it so literally, Austin. Were you reading stories all night?”

I shook my head. “Somebody found out my personal information. A stranger named Carl.”

Her eyes widened. “Wait… What? Did you report him?”

I shrugged. “I’d rather just forget about it. What if he finds out other things about me? What if he doxxes me on Reddit? It was really weird, Gemma. I commented on that post you sent to me, and this guy talked about hunting Mark down.”

“Sociopaths hunting sociopaths,” She shuddered.

I nodded. It felt good to get that off my chest, so I simply put it out of my mind until we got home. But Gemma immediately shoved her phone in my face.

“Austin, isn’t this the same Reddit user?” My flatmate asked.

As I read the post on Gemma’s phone, my eyes endlessly widened — bubbling with building horror. The post detailed a sequence of haunting events:

***u/\[deleted\]***

***My stalker is hiding in my house. (Part 2)***

*It’s finally over…*

*… I found him in the cupboard…*

*… Body bloated…*

*… His mouth was overflowing with water…*

*… Specialists said the cause of death was water intoxication…*

*… Murder investigation…*

My body involuntarily quaked.

“It’s a lie…” Gemma croakily said in denial. “Carl must be the OP of the stalker story. That’s it. He has two different accounts. Report it to the mods. It’s fiction.”

“I’m going to message him,” I said.

*Theeaglestrikes: I saw the update to OP’s stalker situation.*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: I gave you what you wanted.*

*Theeaglestrikes: I know this is fiction. That’s against the subreddit’s rules.*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: Do you enjoy your Biology course, Austin?*

“Wait…” Gemma gasped.

“I told you,” I panted fearfully.

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: Sarah has been giving you bad grades this month. Is everything okay, Austin? Does your lecturer not like you?*

*Theeaglestrikes: I don’t want any trouble, Carl.*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: You are a fragile little bird, aren't you? I don’t like that Sarah clipped your wings, Austin. I’ll show her what happens when she loses sight of a creature’s beauty.*

“We need to call the police,” Gemma said. “This is serious.”

My friend whipped out her phone and started typing.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

She didn’t respond for a good minute or so.

“I messaged him,” Gemma eventually said, showing her phone.

*Gemma: I’m about to call the police. Stop harassing Austin.*

As I was looking, Carl responded.

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: You’re so small, Gemma. So insignificant. Endlessly striving to be more than a speck in Austin’s life. The pathetic creature who fell in love with him.*

“Carl replied,” I whispered. “He knows your name too. Stop, Gemma.”

But my friend furiously typed another message.

*Gemma: You’re the pathetic creature who’s obsessed with him. He won’t report you, but I will.*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: Do you want to be more than a small, meaningless thing, Gemma? I’ll make that happen. I’ll make you unmissable.*

“Why would you antagonise him, Gemma?” I asked.

“To save your sorry arse,” She retorted. “You’re not a doormat, Austin.”

I frowned. “I don’t believe the post, but he knows my name and course details. He might know where we live.”

That night, I tried to stay awake. I was approaching forty hours without sleep when I finally collapsed — not in bed, but on the solid floorboards by my bedroom window. I’d been eyeing the dark road outside our house for hours, convincing myself that I could see a man in the shadows. But exhaustion eventually bested me.

I woke with sore joints, having slept in a messy heap on the wooden floor.

“Great…” I whispered, checking my phone.

It was nine in the morning, and I was late for my lecture. The night before, I locked my bedroom door — fearing that Carl would find me. Gemma couldn’t enter my room and wake me for the bus, I realised, hurriedly getting dressed.

When I eventually arrived at university, the pavement was littered with people. A crowd had formed before the main lecture building.

“Excuse me,” I muttered, weaving through cramped bodies. “I have a lecture.”

“It’ll be cancelled,” Somebody responded.

“Huh?” I asked.

At that moment, I noticed two emergency vehicles parked by the building — an ambulance and a police cruiser.

“What happened?” I asked.

As if answering my question, paramedics emerged from the main entrance. They were carrying a body on a stretcher. The onlookers pressed eagerly against the barrier of police officers.

“Stand back!” A uniformed man ordered. “Give the paramedics some room!”

I couldn’t distinguish the woman on the stretcher, but I knew who it would be.

“They found her eyes in her hands,” One girl solemnly explained.

“Somebody… attacked her?” Another girl asked.

“Apparently,” The first girl replied. “Her eye sockets were empty, and she was coated in her own blood,”

“Who would do that to Sarah? She was lovely,” The second girl whispered.

Sickened by the stranger’s revelation, I turned and pushed my way through the crowd. Not bothering to check both ways, I darted across the road and beelined for the nearby park. When I found an empty bench, I slumped onto it and started hyperventilating.

“It isn’t fiction…” I fearfully accepted aloud.

Against my better judgement, I opened my phone’s browser and went to Reddit.

*Theeaglestrikes: I’m going to the police.*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: Shush, little birdie. Your wings are too weak to fly.*

*Theeaglestrikes: You’re a monster.*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: I want to show you something.*

I exited the browser and began dialling 999, but Reddit notifications appeared at the top of the screen.

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: Mark had a filthy soul — I cleansed him. It was glorious. His swollen belly. Filled to bursting point. Bucket after bucket of water. Seas.*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: Your lecturer did not look for your potential, Austin, so I removed her eyes. Seek.*

*seek\_ceaseless\_seas: We’re missing the middle.*

Carl sent an image.

It was a photo of a dim, damp basement. Coated in dust and grime. No more than a pit in the dirt. The brickwork was faded, and a single lightbulb, stained yellow, hung above a wooden contraption. Some modern, macabre reimagining of a torture rack.

Gemma was bound to it.

I wailed in horror and rang the police. That set in motion a blurry chain of events. A whirlwind of police interviews and investigations that ultimately resulted in nothing. Carl was a ghost. His account was deleted. He still walks the Earth as a free man.

A year later, I received a message.

*still\_seeking\_ceaseless\_seas: She is so beautiful, Austin. Unmissable. Do you finally see her?*

A fresh image depicted my teary-eyed, dishevelled, emaciated friend. She was tied to the same rack in the basement. Unmoved. But she no longer looked like the Gemma I remembered. Her limbs had been elongated. There were stitches circling various sections of her body. The telltale signs of numerous operations. Intervals of artificial, discoloured segments appeared along her arms, legs, and even her neck.

She hadn’t just been stretched. Carl lengthened her by adding plastic sections to her body.

*still\_seeking\_ceaseless\_seas: She’s not small anymore. And she’ll never stop growing. She is ceaseless.*

A piece of me dislocated, and it’ll never return to its rightful place. I am unable to wash my mind of those images. But I managed to summon the willpower to take the picture to the police — the only piece of evidence in months. Carl deleted his second account, of course, and that was the last time I heard from him.

I know he’s out there, mutilating my dear friend in some squalid dungeon. How long do you think she has become?

I don’t want to receive another photo which answers that [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
