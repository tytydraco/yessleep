Hey all, I’m not quite sure how to start these things, but I’ll try anyway since I feel I have to get my experiences off my chest. To start, my name is Eddie, and I’ve spent the last 3 years as a maintenance worker at Deepwell 15, an oil rig off the coast of Florida and I quit there 7 months ago. I can’t stress enough how shitty this job really was, it’s really screwed with me mentally and all I want to do is to tell the world and tell someone who won’t dismiss me or call me crazy. 

Deepwell 15 is remote, 143 miles off the south eastern coast of Florida, it’s surprisingly busy for how remote it is and obviously requires a lot of maintenance considering the water there is really choppy and hurricanes come through pretty often. That’s where i’d come in for routine inspections around the place triweekly on a helicopter, checking out the Drill strings, working on and reporting the top drive system, I won’t bore you with the specifics, I’m sure you get it. That’s not why the job sucked so much though… it’s what went on at that godforsaken rig. 

There’s something seriously wrong with that place, everyone who has ever worked there will tell you that. I’ll share some stories I’ve experienced myself and what I’ve heard from others from my time working there.

Where do I begin? I’ll start with the most basic one, this is about ‘Moona’. That’s what we call it, though we don’t know what “it” is. Tuesdays and Fridays on the rig are characteristically marked without fail by an ear shattering, soul wilting wail that seems to come from deep under the ocean. 

My first experience with Moona was on the first Tuesday on the job. I remember it like it was yesterday, It was a calm, quiet and relatively uneventful night and I was as usual doing routine checks on diving equipment, when suddenly this sound… It was awful, I can’t describe it, no words can describe it. It’s so unbelievably loud, it rattled my very skull, my soul vibrated, I didn’t know sounds could get that loud, and that’s coming from a guy who works on an oil rig for God’s sake. It sounds like if you trapped an animal in a burning furnace, like the cries of a soul that’s been tortured relentlessly, like it’s in agony. Again, no words will do it justice, it’s genuinely the most horrid thing I’ve ever heard. 

I froze, breaking out into a cold sweat and becoming very lightheaded. Reg, the boss of the rig, and one of my best friends there, knew straight away what was up and tried to comfort me. “Yup that’s Moona” he said, a certain tone of pity in his voice, like he was sad to see my first experience with it. It’s pretty obvious that even though he was playing it cool, he was still very visibly shaken. “What the hell is that? That’s a stupid ass name. There’s no way that’s an animal, no goddamn way” He shrugged, frowning. “Nobody knows, I’ve worked here almost every day for the past twelve years and I’ve heard it every Tuesday and Friday without fail.” I obviously wasn’t satisfied with that answer, so I asked, “if it’s happened that often why haven’t you called someone? A scientist? A doctor, someone to explain it.” His face was solemn and cold. “You think we haven’t tried? We’ve reported it countless times, nobody’s believed us enough to come out all the way here.”

He was right, nobody’s ever believed us. I tried reporting it after that day, I went on the internet, contacted anyone I could. Without fail, they’d dismiss it to whale sound, or that i was making it up. 

I’m sure you’re thinking “just record it” but that’s the most unsettling thing of all, we’ve tried that too. I’ve brought cameras and sound equipment with me on many Tuesday and Friday shifts, setting them all up all day and night, just waiting to capture it. But it didn’t happen, no sound. 

But how could that be? Moona was a constant, it never missed a day. Reg was shocked most of all, he had to check if it really was a Friday because he hadn’t experienced one without the shriek since he started the job. Did it know it was being recorded? I don’t know if it really was an “it”, nobody does, the best theory is it has to be some kind of animal, the ocean is 95% undiscovered, there’s every chance some animal bigger than a whale could be lurking in there. But it doesn’t explain how it “knew” that it was being recorded, I tested this week in week out, some weeks I’d record on both days, some I’d do none, or everything in between. It’s not a coincidence, it knew it was being recorded, it had to, what other explanation was there?

The worst part? You never really get used to it, from all my 3 years working there, I never once was desensitised to the sound, you can’t, it’s impossible. That sound is too evil, too unearthly to ever, ever get used to. Reg is the toughest guy I’ve ever met, nothing could make him so much as jump, but Moona’s call will turn him white as a sheet and shake uncontrollably. I’m begging someone takes this seriously, I only wish I was joking. 

Moona is just the tip of the iceberg, however. The next anomaly at Deepwell 15 is ‘the coughing man’ who usually arrives under a full or new moon at high tide, but he’ll be spotted at random intervals all the same, though this is a little more uncommon to my knowledge. He is exactly as described, an old, ragged man with tattered overalls stained with a dubious brown liquid, a beard white as snow and skin the same colour to match, with random patches of leprosy and what looks to be tumours adorning him. He’s always found looking out to sea, perched up on specific spots on the deck, he is always coughing, a guttural, raspy and crunchy sound that never fails to make you uncomfortable. The first rule Reg told me was to never, ever disturb him. “Just leave him be” he said, “really bad things happen if you disturb him.” I’m not one to ask questions or fuck around, so I left it at that and never bothered the man. But of course not everyone is like me, and you have a couple of cases of idiots who couldn’t follow orders. 

The first was the case of Charlie. I don’t know much about him, though one of the electricians went into great detail explaining on a lunch break. He apparently was told many times, (as was everyone else) to under no circumstances disturb the coughing man. He did anyway though, apparently saying “it’s just an old guy, what’s the worst that can happen?” And that it’s “just another way to boss us around.” The electrician described that everything faded to black for a few seconds after Charlie approached the man, and as soon as everyone regained vision, Charlie was gone. 

It was a year and a half before it was discovered where Charlie went, I was there that day, when they discovered a set of teeth in one of the living quarters on the rig, arranged on one of the nightstands was every single tooth from a human mouth, arranged in a row from smallest to largest. Dental records proved it was Charlie’s. And over the coming months the rest of his body parts followed suit, although some (like his ears) never showed up. I know a few people who quit after finding a body part of Charlie’s which was wedged in random places on the rig. Coroners ruled Charlie’s death a freak accident after getting caught in the machinery. Though it’s pretty damn obvious that’s horseshit if you couldn’t tell, it’s that man, and we all know it.

The other was the case of Alan, a freshie who I knew quite well, as we both exchanged lunches frequently. Word on the street was he was made to go tap the coughing man’s shoulder after losing a game of poker, and he disappeared shortly after, his body was found weeks later stuffed into an oil pipe, several deep burn marks and gashes placed randomly on his naked body, his collarbone was missing and several of his entrails were found squeezed through gaps in the pipes, his clothes apparently weren’t found. The thing that stumped us was that he was stuffed unbelievably tight in that pipe, there was no way it could ever fit a human body, rescue operators had to cut the pipes open in an operation that lasted days, and only then could they fit him out the pipe. That one really cut me deep, I thought of Alan as a good friend, he was just a kid, he made me feel welcome at the job. 

Nobody’s gone near the coughing man since Alan at least, but it’s only a matter of time ‘til we get some idiot who fucks around and finds out. 

There was a terrible incident that happened 7 years ago at Deepwell 15. One of the underwater components of the rig failed, and a team of trained divers and maintenance workers were sent in a diving bell to the bottom of the ocean (which was about 380 feet deep). There was regular communication feeds from the bell to the deck so the men knew what was going on. Roughly 5 minutes after they were lowered, horrible screams emerged from from the feed, shrieks and wails were uninterrupted for several minutes until it went deathly silent. When the bell was retrieved, they checked inside to see what went on, what they found wasn’t pretty. All 6 men’s bodies were gone, the only trace of them left were some untouched livers and spleens, and blood that painted the inside of the bell. Of course, there’s a strange part, the blood inside was completely dry, like it was there for weeks. What we think are messages, were painted in blood on the walls, though they’re pretty much undecipherable. At least we think they’re messages, the placement of the strokes of blood made strange shapes that are so ordered and refined we could only assume it was some sort of language, like whatever did this was trying to tell us something.  

Authorities and experts chalked their deaths up to delta p, citing the similarities to the ‘byphord dolphin’ incident. Which is a load of bullshit if you ask me, I know delta p, I’m well aware of what happens from changes in pressure, that doesn’t explain why their bodies were gone or why the blood was somehow dry despite being pulled up moments after being lowered or the fucking ‘runes’ painted inside the bell. They won’t get it though, that’s what pisses me off, the signs are there but they don’t wanna listen.

There’s plenty more anomalies that happen here, I could write a whole novel just on everything weird that happens here. Like the sirens, the obscene creatures that only show up when a fog rolls in, they look like your average mermaid, if average mermaids had an uncomfortably long withered face, a gaping black huge oblong mouth, hollow sunk in eye sockets, pale skin, an emaciated torso with ribs that show very prominently, and long spindly arms that they use to rip prey apart. They’ll rap on your door, though to be clear it’s an inhuman knock. Like it’s trying to imitate a knock but just can’t get it right. You know a normal knock? It’ll sound like “knock knock knock”. The sirens tried to replicate this with a “knock… knock knock… knock”  and coupled with this, it imitates a human voice, often family members or friends to lure victims outside. They’ve tried on occasion to lure me out using my daughter and wife’s voices, but I was too terrified to move, it’s so hard not to join them. Like an invisible force pulls you toward them, I thank God or whoever is there watching me that I was lucky enough to be too scared to move, as some other guys weren’t so lucky. I’ve lost several cabin mates and crew members to them, as soon as a fog rolls in, at least one person is guaranteed to go. 

I see them in my nightmares sometimes, hearing that godawful knock, their voices, their faces peeking in through my window. The way their heads move so unnaturally, their heads tilted and vibrating quickly, mouth agape and calling out to whoever is unfortunate enough to be near them. 

That’s all from me tonight, I’ll be sure to post more in the coming days. There’s way more anomalies at Deepwater 15 that I just couldn’t fit in one post, hand on tight for updates.

EDIT:

What the fuck, what the fuck. I’m there, I’m at Deepwell 15 now, I don’t know how I got here, how the hell did I get here? I went to sleep, I don’t know how I possibly got here, someone help me please… someone get me outta here, something’s here and it’s coming for us. I beg of you. I don’t have much time left, it’s right outside the door. Someone please, report this, hear my cries for help. The world needs to know what goes on there, I can’t stress this enough or some more people might get hurt, please. I don’t want to die. I’m begging you, whoever’s reading this, do something.
