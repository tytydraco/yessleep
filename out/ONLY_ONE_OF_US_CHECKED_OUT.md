What follows is the truth as I remember it. Or at least what I wrote down and read over and over again in that room at Ridgewood. Like maybe it would change if I stared long enough. 

They said my behavior concerned them. That my memory didn’t add up. I told them, again and again, I was only looking for answers about that night. 

They didn’t listen. 

So I smuggled myself, and this story, out, in hoping the truth might finally be told. 

————————————————————————

My wife, Amanda, and I had been planning this trip for months. The weight of city life had been grinding us down to chalk, and we needed to get away. 

She worked on retainer as a counselor for a big finance company. Every day, she listened to the problems of men who made more in a month than she did in a year. And every day, she forced on a cheery smile, recycled the same advice, and glanced at the clock behind their heads, counting the minutes until she could finally turn to her own problems.

One of those problems was me. She’d said as much more than once. 

I’d been unemployed for over three years. Not by choice, but by circumstance. A mental health blip ended with me sending an email I never should have, and the advance for my next book was rescinded. Writer jail, they called it. It’s not great when the only tool you have to make money is actively working against you.

The strain of those years pressed so hard on our marriage we were scared to name it. Sex and intimacy had disappeared like tears in a rainstorm. Our conversations had the clipped politeness of strangers passing on a subway platform. We were ghosts loitering at the same gravesite. 

Sometimes sparks would catch. A joke, a smile that felt like the old days. But they never lasted.

She still wore the necklace I’d given her: a tiny gold medallion with her initials etched into it, barely the size of a dime. She used to play with it absentmindedly when she was deep in thought. Lately, she fidgeted with it like a cigarette she couldn’t light. I used to call it her “tether,” something to pull her back to me when she drifted too far. Now, it just reminded me how far we’d both gone.

The trip felt doomed before it even began.

————————————————————————

*Thunk!*

“They’re fully booked,” I said, sliding back into the driver’s seat and trying to keep the frustration out of my voice.

The dash’s green glow painted Amanda’s face in sickly light, enough to catch the grind in her jaw and the glassy accusation behind her eyes. It was my fault somehow. Like always.

Weeks ago, during one of our silences, she’d said maybe this trip was our last shot. I thought she meant the last chance to relax. Now I wasn’t so sure.

“There’s another place a few miles up,” I said. “Exit 247. They said it’s… quieter.”

She pinched and zoomed her phone’s map, as if willing something to appear.

“There’s no Exit 247,” she said slowly. “Are you sure that’s what they told you?”

I kept my eyes on the windshield. My hands tightened around the wheel. She didn’t need an answer. She already had one.

Darkness pressed in from all sides as the freeway unwound into nothing. I killed the radio after cycling through nothing but static and angry religious sermons. One could be mistaken for the other.

“Slow down,” she snapped. I eased off the gas, scanning the tree line for a sign. Any sign.

A battered turnoff emerged, half-swallowed by weeds. Forgotten. Or worse, remembered by the wrong people. Amanda glanced at me. A crease of doubt flickered in her brow, but her eyes said, *Go.*

The tires crunched over cracked asphalt. The turnoff felt… familiar. Like I’d made this drive before.

————————————————————————

Hidden Oasis Motel. Aptly named if your idea of an oasis is a graveyard of neon and mildew. At least Amanda and I were united on one thing: this was the last place on earth either of us wanted to be.

A scrim of dust clung to the two cars in the lot. The motel was a row of double-wides stitched together: six doors, rusted number plates. Off to the side, a squat hut with a dangling sign: Office*.*

“Finally, a sign,” I joked. Amanda smiled. Brief. Faint.

We walked toward the hut. Her hand found mine and squeezed tight when a bird called out. A sharp, piercing trill that reverberated through my bones.

A welcome? A warning?

The door opened with a gasp, like the wood had been holding its breath. The floor groaned underfoot. Against the far wall, a splintering desk. A single clipboard rested on top, its pages crammed with handwriting that looked more like claw marks than names.

The silence inside felt… expectant. Like the room was waiting.

Amanda leaned close. “We should go—”

“Hello.” 

The voice slid out of the shadows behind us.

The man in the doorway looked clipped from a men’s magazine. Tan arms, sculpted and still, peaked beneath the sleeves of a spotless white shirt. His dark hair parted like clockwork, and his smile looked like something he’d been saving just for us.

As he passed, his hand brushed the small of Amanda’s back. Too precise to be accidental.

“Do you have a reservation?”

Amanda didn’t answer, but I felt the heat rise in her cheeks.

“Uh… no. No reservation.”

The smile didn’t move.

A pause. Long enough to feel like a glitch.

“One room… or two?”

The question lodged in my throat. I couldn’t tell if he was joking or… just a little off.

“Just one room,” I said.

His smile stretched wider. Without looking, he reached under the desk and placed a key on the clipboard.

“Room number five,” he said, holding up three fingers on one hand, two on the other.

“You’ve stayed here before… haven’t you?” 

He just stood there, smiling. Waiting.

“No,” I said. “We haven’t.”

A slow blink.

“Please sign in. For my records.”

I scrawled my name as illegibly as possible. Better to stay anonymous. 

But halfway through setting the pen down, the thought hit: *What if something happens and they need to know my name?*

“Oh my god!” 

I turned. Amanda had stepped back, her face pale, eyes locked on the man.

A thin trail of blood trickled from his nose, dotting the collar of his white shirt.

“Are you okay?” she asked.

He inhaled sharply. The blood vanished.

His smile never faltered.

“Enjoy your stay at the Oasis.”

————————————————————————

“What the fuck?” Amanda muttered as she stepped inside and flicked on the light.

I assumed she meant the man in the office, until I saw her face:

“Todd. Look at this.”

My smile collapsed.

It wasn’t a motel room. It was **our** room. The quilt her mom gave us. The dresser with the loose handle. The Charleston photo we lost years ago, framed, and waiting.

“We need to go. Now.”

She bolted for the door. 

I followed, patting my pockets.

No keys. No phone. Nothing.

“I can’t find the keys.”

Panic flicked in her eyes. Her chest rose and fell faster.

“I must’ve left them in the office,” I said, hoping the words were true. 

I reached the office door and pulled.

Locked.

Harder.

“Fuck.”

“Todd… what’s happening?”

“Just hang on.”

I gripped the handle with both hands and yanked until my shoulders ached. The door didn’t move.

Amanda shoved me aside. “Move. You’re useless.”

She tried. Nothing.

She froze for a beat, eyes scanning for an escape.

Then:

“HELLO?! SIR? ARE YOU IN THERE?”

Only the wind answered, threading through the trees like a whisper.

I stepped around the side of the hut and spotted a small window.

“Amanda. Come here.”

We cupped our hands to the glass.

The man stood behind the desk. Perfectly still. His gaze fixed on some distant point, the humming fluorescent light washing him pale. 

On the desk: our phones. Our keys. 

Like bait.

————————————————————————

“Maybe someone else is staying here,” Amanda said as we slunk back toward the rooms.

“Weren’t there two other cars here?” I muttered, eyeing our lone car in the lot.

We crept up to Door #1. Before we could knock, voices erupted inside. An argument mid-swing. Amanda froze. Embarrassed, almost.

A woman’s voice, frantic, breaking at the edges: 

*“How many times do I have to say it? I’ve asked you over and over and you don’t change.”*

The words stuck in me like thorns. Familiar in a way I couldn’t place.

I knocked.

“Hello? Can anyone help us?” 

The crying didn’t pause. Didn’t shift. It looped on like a recording.

We moved to Door #2. 

A man’s voice now, harsh and ragged:

“*You fucking bitch! You think I’m happy? No, you make me miserable. I hate hearing the door open and knowing it’s you. I wish you’d just fucking die.”*

My heart stopped. 

I knew that voice. 

It was **mine**. 

But I'd never said those words.

…Would I?

Before I could think, I was at the peephole.

Inside, I saw myself. Pacing. Chasing Amanda across the room. Her back pressed to the wall. Her face loud with fear.

I lurched back, my stomach knotted, throat dry. 

Amanda stared at me, pale, her eyes locked on mine like I’d just struck her.

“We need to go. Now.”

I didn’t argue.

We looked toward the freeway. A silent agreement. And ran.

Then— 

**BOOM!**

The ground buckled. My knees gave. And I tasted gravel.

————————————————————————

I woke groggy, head throbbing, and stumbled back toward our room.

Amanda looked up when I shut the door.

“Where were you?” she asked.

“What? There was that noise and then—”

“There’s no one else here,” she whispered.

The words sucker punched me. 

She collapsed onto the bed like the air had been sucked out of her.

“It’s going to be okay,” I said, though the lie tasted stale. A high-pitched ringing gnawed at my ears, growing louder by the second.

She stared at the ceiling. The silence between us grew legs, crawled up the walls.

“We’ll get the phones. The keys. We’ll figure this out and get the hell out of here.”

She didn’t respond right away.

“I don’t think we work anymore, Todd.”

The words gutted me. She didn’t flinch. 

"But I still wanted this trip to prove me wrong.”

I stared at her. Jaw slack. Heart twisting.

“Amanda—”

**BOOM!**

The room jolted. A picture frame fell, the glass shattering across the floor like a scream.

We didn’t move. Not this time.

Something had shifted. Between us. Inside the motel. Deeper.

Amanda rose and crossed the room. The light caught her in a way that made her shimmer, like a mirage.

She picked up the fallen frame and stared at it for a long beat. Her brows pinched. Her lip trembled.

She turned it toward me.

“I swear we’ve been here before.”

“Here?” I echoed. “I don’t think so. I mean, yeah, the room’s scarily close to ours, but—”

My voice trailed off as I took the frame.

It was us. Younger. Glowing with new love. Sitting in a restaurant I didn’t recognize. Smiling over a plate of something I couldn’t name.

“Our first date,” she said softly.

I blinked, hard.

“No, that’s not right. We saw a movie on our first date. And we didn’t take a picture. I’d remember this.”

She exhaled like she was releasing ten years of longing in a single breath. Her eyes were wet but unblinking.

“So, tell me… how are you going to fix this?”

The question almost made me crumple.

She wasn’t asking about the motel.

She was asking about us*.*

I felt her searching my face for a version of me that used to have answers.

I stared at the photo.

This wasn’t a place built on logic. This was something else.

Still, I nodded.

“I have a plan.”

————————————————————————

We ran.

Through the gravel lot. Toward the tree line. Toward the road. Toward anything that wasn’t this motel.

The trees blurred as we sprinted past them. My breath sharp and hot in my chest. Amanda just ahead of me, her ponytail bouncing with each step. We didn’t speak. We didn’t need to. 

We knew we had to get out.

But the farther we ran, the more everything started to look… familiar.

As we broke from the trees, the air pressure popped in my ears. And the smell of the mildew rolled over us warm, like morning breath.

And then, like a nightmare folding in on itself—

We emerged back into the parking lot.

**The Hidden Oasis.**

Amanda spun in place.

“No. No, no no no…” Her voice rose like static, hands digging into her hair. “We were just—”

She broke off and looked at the office. Her eyes darted to me, wide, almost pleading.

“I’m going to get the keys,” she said, already moving.

“Amanda, wait—”

She yanked open the door and slipped inside without looking back. The door clicked shut behind her.

I followed, maybe two steps behind.

When I stepped inside, the room was exactly as we’d left it.

Except Amanda wasn’t there.

Just empty air where she should’ve been.

“Amanda?” I called, softer than I meant to. The hope in my own voice embarrassed me.

“Hello,” a voice said behind me. Calm. Polite.

I turned.

The man from the office stood beneath the crooked doorway, backlit by the buzzing light behind him. Same white shirt, immaculate. Same gelled hair, perfectly parted.

Around his neck, resting against the spotless fabric—

Amanda’s necklace.

The gold caught the light, and my stomach dropped before my brain caught up.

“Sir?” The man said again. “Do you have a reservation?”

His tone was the same, but there was something else in it now. Something that almost sounded like her voice, hiding underneath his.

I stared. My lips moved but no sound came out.

My eyes dropped to the clipboard on the desk.

Rows and rows of signatures. All the same.

My name. **Todd M—**

Over and over and over again.

The ink faded in some spots. Fresh in others.

Dates reaching back years.

Room Number: always **Five**.

My throat closed.

“Where is she?”

The man tilted his head. His smile didn’t move.

Then his hand shot out, clamping my wrist with impossible strength. The pressure ground bone against bone until stars pricked my vision.

I tried to yank free, but his grip only tightened, the heat of his skin searing through mine.

“There was never a woman here with you,” he said, his voice smooth as glass.

My knees nearly gave. When he finally released me, the skin around my wrist was already purpling, the shape of his fingers burned into me like a brand.

The words landed like I’d already heard them before.

“No. No. She was here. She was right—”

“You’ve stayed with us before,” he said calmly, adjusting the medallion so it caught the light. “Welcome back.”

I stepped back like I’d been shot. The smell of mildew swelled in my throat.

The light in **Room #5** flicked on.

I stared at it for a long time before I walked back inside.

The room was silent. Still. Like it was waiting.

On the dresser sat that photo Amanda showed me earlier. From our supposed “first date.”

But now… there was only **me** in it.

My face frozen in a grin that didn’t feel like mine.

I dropped the frame.

It landed face down, with a soft, dull thud.

And for the first time since this whole thing began, I let myself wonder:

**Had she ever really been here at all?**

————————————————————————

There are pieces of this that don’t make sense to others. 

At Ridgewood, they smirked. Laughed behind my back in group. They didn’t believe my story. My truth. 

And so I began to alter it. Not the truth, never the truth, but the shape of it. I trimmed its edges, smoothed the parts that made them squirm. I fed the versions they could digest. And in return, they gave me freedoms. A longer leash. 

But a leash is still a leash.

After a while, I knew the only way to find her, to fix this, was to leave Ridgewood. On my own accord.

That story is for another day. Another time. 

Perhaps I’ll tell it once I’ve found Amanda.

If she was ever here to be found.

————————————————————————

I have escaped, but I am weighed down by doubt and questions. 

For what is the cost of freedom if I am still a prisoner?

A prisoner to the echo of her voice in rooms that no longer exist. To a love that may never have been mine. To a memory that rots a little more each day.

Every morning I try to recall her laugh, her scent, the weight of her hand in mine. Each day it drifts farther from reach. I whisper her name just to hear it spoken aloud, but even that sounds unfamiliar now.

If she was never here, what does that make me?

I turn my wrist over. The bruise is still there, swollen and purple, the shape of his fingers pressed into me like a question I can’t answer. Proof of something. Of what, I can’t say.

And if she was… why was I the only one who checked out?
