I was around 14-17 around the time my sister got brutally murdered out of nowhere. My whole family was completely torn up about it, including me and my friends. My big sis was always the coolest person around: Giving us free drinks, hanging with us like she was one of the guys, and generally just acting like the rational person in our friend group who admittedly did follow us into some stupid ideas sometimes, but no one really minded that.

When the police arrived at our house, they (for some reason) sent out a sketchy looking guy, telling us that he was a "new officer who is extremely nervous cause this is his first time doing stuff like this". From the moment he entered, I noticed something off about him, but I convinced myself it was because I was grieving and because the guy was probably extremely nervous. 

As the interview began, he asked me the normal police questions like "where were you at the scene of the crime?", "at what time did all of this happen?", "who was at the scene of the crime?" Etc etc. As the interview went on though, he looked a little more.. how do I say it.. sporadic? He suddenly started wobbling his leg and sat on the edge of his seat, his face went from nervous to a kind of.. happy/excited? Which I thought was kind of weird but hey, maybe he just really liked his job. 

My family was still around in the room at the time of the interview, helping me answer questions if I wasn't able to get the words out of my mouth which I greatly appreciated. But eventually, the cop that was interviewing me changed somehow. His whole personality did a 180 from being very nervous and kind of excited to looking at me stone faced and almost coldly. He asked my dad to "Go and get some of the things from her room" for "Extra fingerprints of the victim", at this point even my dad started looking at the officer suspiciously, but still followed the officers command. My mother left some time ago, sitting on the front porch, bawling her eyes out while thinking of the state her daughters body was in when we found her. 

No human could've done that to my big sister.

As me and the officer were alone in the room, he started looking at me like I was the prime suspect, making me extremely offended and wanting to yell at him, but I couldn't make myself do it as he was a person of law that could arrest me if he wanted to. He kept interviewing me and eventually returned to his state from before, but.. something was different about him.. 

He was even more excited, having an almost manic look in his eyes as he kept asking me to describe what had happened to my sister, I got weirded out enough that I eventually went to the bathroom to clear my mind, after all, I was probably just imagining the cop's expression. The guy was new, and I was grieving so, there was probably nothing wrong with him.

As I splashed some water onto my face to clear my mind and left the bathroom, I saw the officer sitting on the chair he was previously in, but something was off.

I sat across the officer again, and looked at his face clearly for the first time.





That was not the officer we've talked to.





Something killed my sister, and I know what did it.
