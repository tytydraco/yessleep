It was december the 24th 2019 I was just 16 years old when all of this happened, which makes the date all the more memorable, not only because it was Christmas Eve, but also because it was the day when one of the worst things ever happened to me and my family.

My sister got brutally murdered out of nowhere. My whole family was completely torn up about it, including me and my friends. My big sis was always the coolest person around: Giving us free drinks, hanging with us like she was one of the guys, and generally just acting like the rational person in our friend group who admittedly did follow us into some stupid ideas sometimes, but no one really minded that.

Almost every time I think of my big sister, I can't help but image the horrible, horrible state that we found her... Even thinking about it makes me want to throw up, which I probably am going to do after writing this.

When the police arrived at our house, they (for some reason) sent out a sketchy looking guy, along with his "detective" partner, telling us that he was a "new officer who is extremely nervous cause this is his first time doing stuff like this". From the moment he entered, I noticed something off about him, but I convinced myself it was because I was grieving and because the guy was probably extremely nervous. 

As the interview began, they both asked me the normal police questions like "where were you when the crime took place?", "at what time did all of this happen?", "who was at the scene of the crime?" Etc etc. As the interview went on though, the newbie looked a little more.. how do I say it.. sporadic? He suddenly started wobbling his leg and sat on the edge of his seat, his face went from nervous to a kind of.. happy/excited? I mean, even his detective partner noticed it. I could tell from the way the detective looked at me, keeping the newbie just in his peripheral. Which I thought was kind of weird but hey, maybe he just really liked his job, and his partner wanted to keep an eye on him so everything would go smoothly. 

My family was still around in the room at the time of the interview, helping me answer questions if I wasn't able to get the words out of my mouth which I greatly appreciated. But eventually, the cop that was interviewing me changed somehow. His whole personality did a 180 from being very nervous and kind of excited to looking at me stone faced and almost coldly. He asked his partner to "Go and get some of the things from her room" for "Possible proof of a struggle or anything that shows that the victim was conscious when she was attacked", at this point even his partner started looking at the officer suspiciously, but still followed the officers command. Impressed and almost stunned by the way the officer could switch to business mode that fast. My mother left some time ago, sitting on the front porch, bawling her eyes out while thinking of the state her daughters body was in when we found her. Her dad was trying his best to comfort her on the porch as well, but failing miserably. After all,

No human could've done that to my big sister.

It just felt like a normal day, I got up, went to eat breakfast but stopped when I was halfway done with the pancakes my mother made for me, as my sister didn't respond to my mother's calls for food. We were never really a family that intruded each others privacy but this had never happened, my sister has never not come down when our mom made us breakfast. My father rolled his eyes and jokingly said something along the lines of "guess she's a deep sleeper huh?" Me and my mom laughed as my dad went upstairs to wake my sister up, that's when we heard my father's horrified shriek. We rushed up the stairs to see what was wrong, and let me tell you.

I will never be able to forget what I saw.

She was ripped limb from limb, her entire body seeming.. "flat". Whatever killed my sister, made sure to consume every bit of her insides that it could, leaving her as.. an empty skin husk.. it was done with over the top levels of precision, almost seeming like a doctor or a surgeon did it while she was asleep or something. 

But I know that whatever did this, was not human in the slightest.

As me and the officer were alone in the room, he started looking at me like I was the prime suspect, making me extremely offended and wanting to yell at him, but I couldn't make myself do it as he was a person of law that could arrest me if he wanted to. He kept interviewing me and eventually returned to his state from before, but.. something was different about him.. 

He was even more excited, having an almost manic look in his eyes as he kept asking me to describe what had happened to my sister, I got weirded out enough that I eventually went to the bathroom to clear my mind, after all, I was probably just imagining the cop's expression. The guy was new, and I was grieving so, there was probably nothing wrong with him.

As I splashed some water onto my face to clear my mind and left the bathroom, I saw the officer sitting on the chair he was previously in, but something was off.

I sat across the officer again, and looked at his face clearly for the first time.





That was not the officer we've talked to.





Something killed my sister, and I know what did it.
