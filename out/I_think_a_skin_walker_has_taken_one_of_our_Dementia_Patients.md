 
I was told the night shift would be quiet.

*“Most of them sleep through,”* the agency said. *“Easiest twelve hours of your life.”*

I took it. I needed the money. Needed something simple. Needed to believe that quiet still existed.

The care home was out near Ranworth Quarry. A long, low brick building sunk into the countryside, like it had collapsed tired into the fields. The kind of place that hadn’t been built so much as allowed to spread. Fake fireplace in the lobby, greying wallpaper with birds on it, the constant chemical sting of hand sanitiser and microwaved peas. Twelve rooms. One nurse. One of us.

I’d never worked with dementia patients before.

••

Karen met me at the back entrance just before ten. She looked like she’d been carved from gristle and hard days—grey hair tied back with a biro shoved behind one ear. She handed me the clipboard and pointed to a single name, circled twice.

*“Room Nine,”* she said. “Mr Hartley. You won’t forget him.”*

*“What’s the deal?”*

She lit a cigarette and stood under the motion-sensor light. It didn’t come on.

*“Used to be a teacher. Knew every pub quiz answer going. Sharp as vinegar. Then one afternoon he slips out during handover—vanishes. Gone three days. They find him barefoot at the quarry, standing still as a statue. Blood under his nails. Scratches on his face. Doesn’t speak.”*

I blinked. *“Jesus.”*

Karen shrugged like it bored her. *“Came back quieter. You won’t need to do much—just check he’s not wandering. If he looks at you funny, it’s not personal.”*

She dropped the cigarette and crushed it under her heel. *“And if he says your name, don’t answer.”*

••

Room Nine was at the far end of the west wing, across from the linen cupboard. I passed it just after midnight.

Mr Hartley was awake. His lamp was on, casting amber light across the floor. I stopped at the door, just to glance in.

He was sitting in the chair by the window. Perfectly still. Arms resting on the padded arms like someone had posed him. His face was pale, drawn—cheekbones too sharp, lips bloodless. His eyes were open, fixed on something in the dark outside.

Except the window faced the garden wall.

“Mr Hartley?” I whispered.

He didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

The light buzzed. The radiator knocked once, like a warning.

I left him be.

••

At 1:37 a.m., I walked the corridor again. The lights in the west wing flickered slightly as I passed. I blamed the wind.

Room Nine’s door was ajar now. Just a crack. Enough to see one foot on the carpet. Pale. Bare. Motionless.

I stopped. Waited.

The foot didn’t twitch. Just stood there, like a prop left behind.

I walked on, trying not to check behind me.

••

I didn’t hear him leave his room, but I found him in the activity lounge at 2:09. The overhead lights were off. Only the fishtank glowed—soft blue bubbles rising past sleepy goldfish.

Mr Hartley sat in the armchair closest to the screen. Hands on his knees. Eyes wide.

*“Can’t sleep?”* I asked.

He didn’t move.

*“Let’s get you back to bed.”*

He turned his head slowly, like something had to click in his neck before he could move.

“You’re not Graham,”* he said.

*“No,”* I said. *“I’m just on nights.”*

He tilted his head, bird-like. *“But you’re wearing him.”*

I hesitated.

*“Come on,”* I said, gently. *“Back to your room.”*

He stood. Too quickly. The movement was wrong. Not rushed—jerked. Like strings being pulled.

As we walked, he muttered something. I caught fragments.

*“Too many mouths… not enough faces… they don’t remember which skin was theirs…”*

••

At 3:26 a.m., I made tea in the staff kitchen and sat with my back to the radiator.

The building creaked. Somewhere down the corridor, a door clicked open.

I stood, steaming mug in hand, and stepped into the hallway.

At the far end, a shadow moved.

*Mr Hartley.*

*Standing still.*

*Watching me.*

He was behind the linen cupboard door, half-hidden, just one shoulder visible. But I could see enough.

His head leaned out first. Then his face—grinning, wrong. Lips pulled too tight, like they’d split. His eyes too round, too still.

Just watching me.

I turned the light on.

He was gone.

••

By 4:30, I was on edge.

Every shadow felt too full.

I passed Room Nine again.

His door was shut now.

But under the frame, I saw movement.

Two feet.

Slamming back and forth across the room.
Not pacing—charging, like something testing the length of a leash.

I heard the thud of heel on flooring. Over and over.
Each pass faster, heavier. Like a caged thing building speed.

Then stillness.

Then—

***SLAM.***

The door jolted in its frame. I jumped back.
Mr Hartley had hurled himself against it. I could hear his breath now, heavy and wet, rattling through clenched teeth.

***“WHERE ARE YOU!?”*** he growled through the wood.

My heart thundered. I stumbled back a step.

Then I heard something slide under the door.
Just a whisper of paper. A note.

I picked it up, hands shaking.

It was blank. Except for one word, written in a jagged scrawl: 

***“SOON.”***

••

At 5 a.m., I did a full round just to keep moving.

Halfway down the east wing, I caught something in the corner of my eye.

A figure. Bent low.

Peering through the glass pane in the fire exit door.

I turned fully.

Gone.

The corridor was empty. But on the window, I could still see a smear.

A perfect, pale handprint.

Five fingers.

But too long. Too wide.

Like someone had tried on the idea of a hand and got it slightly wrong.

••

I told myself I was just tired.

That dementia does strange things to people.

That this was all just my inexperience, my anxiety, making ghosts out of shadows.

But when Karen came back at 6, I didn’t tell her what I saw.

She walked past me like normal. Clocked in. Put her lunch in the fridge.

*“You look rough,”* she said.

*“Didn’t sleep well,”* I lied.

She poured coffee.

*“I’ll take over,”* she said. *“Anything happen?”*

I shook my head.

She smiled. *“Told you. Quiet shift.”*

••

As I left, Room Nine’s door cracked open again.

Mr Hartley was just behind it. Only a slither of his face visible.

*One eye.*

*Half a smile.*

*The tip of his tongue, resting lightly on his lip.*

Still watching.

Like he’d never stopped.

I’m back on shift tomorrow night.

If anything else happens, I’ll update here.
