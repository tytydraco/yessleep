Monday morning, I drive to a mall for my job interview as a security guard, when I arrive I saw beautiful red themed building, make my way to the 3rd floor, I realize a lot of security guards here, like a lot of security guards, find the office lobby I'm going straight to the receptionist.

"I'm here for interview with John" I said with my best business smile.

"yes, I've been told" she smile, this resepsionist are exceptionally beautiful with her long black hair, lead me to a small meeting room she smile and leave, I Sit in one of four chairs and playing with my phone.

5 minutes, 10 minutes, then 15 has past, 20 minutes after entering this room I start to feel impatient, Im trying to open the door but it won't open.

"excuse me!, the door jammed! Could you help me?" I call for the receptionist.

"hey! I'm seriously Locked here! Help me!!" I screamed, then I saw a shillouette of someone coming from the blurry glass door, I could tell it was the receptionist girl.

"I'm so sorry, I'm locked inside could get me out here?" she just standing still in front of the room, I feel angry now, Im banging the glass door.

"hey?! What are doing?! Get me out!" Im screaming, she just stand there, an hour has past, i sit to calm myself thinking what to do, call the cops to this building?.

The door open behind me, startled by the noise of the door, someone came in, I turn my head to see a man.

"who are you?" the man ask me with confusion.

"thats my line!! The hell happens here!?" I shout.

"im sorry there must be a misunderstanding here, my name is john" he introduce himself as john the guy I'm supposed to have interview with.

"I'm going home" I try to leave, but he keep ask me to talk, he seems sincerely, so I tell with him what happens.

"receptionist with a long hair?" John ask.

"yes" I said resentfully, John lost in his though and sweats start to appear in his face before he lift his face and smile.

"I understand there is have been a mistake and we will take a full responsibility for it" John smile brightly "to save the problem we will accept your job application"

"could you do that?, just accept me like that?" I doubted.

"yes it's our honest mistake after all"

John make me a contract in place, the payment was 1.5 what they originally offer, and he promise me to give a talk to the receptionist girl, when I goes out the lobby the receptionist are a different girl.

I'm drive home light hearted, but my car feel so heavy like it carrying a boulder, did this car finally crap itself?, I worried inside my car that feels like a dying hamster.

John ask me to work right away the day after, I got night shift, weird enough my car feel a lot lighter when i arrive in the parking lot.

Meet John inside, he lead me into a second floor, into a employees door only, in the end of the hallway there is a metal blast door.

"here is where you gonna work for the night" John said.

"it's a cctv room?, is it alright for a new guy to be here?" I ask.

"I've talk to the upper up, they understand the circumstances, this is the safest room in this building" John proudly claimed.

"alright" I said, they are the one makes the rules I thought.

John teach me how to operate the monitors and excuse himself, before that however he told me to read the brown envelope, I search for the brown envelope but it was nowhere to be found, so I'm just watching my monitors.

10:00 pm the mall start to closing.

11:00 All store have been close and all visitors have gone hour ago, I watch other security guard checking all room the building thoroughly.

11:45 all the security guards start to leaving.

What?, aren't they supposed to guard this place?.

I start to panic, grab my walkie talkie it's dead silent, I open the metal door, lucky it's easyly opened, set my foot to a dim light building I climb down the stairs to the first floor, this place was so creepy, trying every door it's locked tight, it won't even budge, the door abnormally sturdy, I regretted stepping out of that room, trying to climb back to the second floor I heard a footstep from a round corner, it's getting close and closer  
then the person show up, a security guards in his early 20s.

"are you the guy that work in the safe room?"

"safe room?"

"ah I mean cctv room" I goes down to meet him, he told me his name is bill, hes been working as a security guard in this building for three months, he handed me a brown envelope.

"where you get this?" I grab the brown envelope with my name on it.

" John told me to give this to you before midnight but I completely forgot, they actually didn't let anyone enter the building after closing under any circumstances so could you spare me from telling john" Bill said with awkward smile.

"alright, let me ask you something"

"what is it?" bill tilted his head.

"where all the guards go?"

"ah there is a post around this building that where all the guards are stationed" I let a sight of relief under my breath, if all the guards are here there is nothing to fear.

"Alright, i wont tell nobody" i said while climb the stairs to the second floor.

"thank yo-" bill voices was cut short by a splat noise and a thug of something hit the ground.

I look back, bill head was gone blood splattered everywhere, a creature with a degraded face chewing his head licking the blood, it has a looonggg black hair, the most noticeable thing is its neat red uniform just like the receptionist in 3rd floor are wearing.

I grip the stairs rail so hard not to faint out, the thing turn it's head to me, smile ear to ear literally, using all my strength to run up the stairs, I could hear the creature follow behind, im toasted!, I'm not gonna make it!, however to my luck the elevator in front of me open on its own, I jumped right inside, a sound of crash behind me and the elevator shaking.  
My heart beating out of my chest, what that thing?, my leg crumble under me, I sit Lifeless inside the elevator.

the elevator start to go down toward the basement, did the thing calling the elevator from basement?, my blood ran cold, the elevator door start to open, i close my eyes for nightmare that is coming, but nothing is coming.

I open my eyes to see a red curtain covering the elevator, then I heard rattling noise come from the ceiling.

"hey!! We need to get out of here!!" a man voice came from behind the curtain.

"come on we need to run!!" the rattle sound become louder and louder, I want to stand up but my legs are jelly.

"what are you doing!!"

"help me!" I screamed, then a voice of a little girl.

"daddy!"

"what the hell!?"

"shoot that damn thing!!"

Man, woman, young, old, the voice keep changing, it was a trap, the last thing I saw was the red curtain bend forward revealing a big head creature with rotten flesh and doll like eyes staring at me before the door was closed.

I managed to stand on my feet trying to catch what just happens, then the elevator start to go up.

"no, no, no!" I tried to stop it to no avail, the elevator arrive at 4th floor, the door open, I readying myself for the horror awaits.

but what awaits in the other side was a butler with his gray hair and fancy suit, he politely bow to me.

"sir, your reservation are ready"

I ignore it.

"sir, I there a problem? " the butler keep trying to persuade me to go out the elevator, it's another trap, I knew the rule, if I leave the elevator I died, The elevator door start to close, im safe, until the butler step in and stop the door.

My jaw dropped.

"sir you are so pale, let me help you, this way sir" the butler grab me out of the elevator, I'm to weak to even fight back.

I sit in one of restaurants table with a candle and red flower, staring at a big steak in my plate, it's packed full of people, the waiters, the cooks the people chatting in the back ground, everything seems normal, but I knew it's all a trap after I read John letter that I had in my hand all this time.

Hi.

Have you meet bill?, I want tell you myself but I'm afraid you would run away.

listen carefully, this building is special, there is a creatures Beyond horror in ever corner of this building, lucky they are bound to a rule.

the receptionist you meet are one of the creature, The receptionist table was not to leave empty more than 5 minutes thats one of the rules, the thing will follow you and kill you, then the creature would roam freely, however there is a rule that we could use.

If you survive a night in this place, that thing would let you go.

DO NOT LEAVE YOUR ROOM NO MATTER WHAT.

You safe there, the thing can't get in, there will be a compensation for all of this, see you in the morning.

John.

I'm typing this in the restaurant, I don't know the rules.
