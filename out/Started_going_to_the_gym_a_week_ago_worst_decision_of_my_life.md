I have always been fat. At first, I thought I was just a bit chubby. I even thought of it as a good thing. When I was young, the elders had always called me cute. Up until middle school, I was always popular among girls, always in girl groups. They said my bear-like body and baby face, thanks to chubby cheeks, made them feel safe, unlike other guys. In high school, I noticed my girl-friends started distancing themselves from me. And no new girls ever approached me, whether platonically or romantically. It took me months to gather up my courage and finally stood in front of one of my ex-friends. asking her why is everyone distancing themselves from me, she answered that they didn’t feel safe around me anymore.

&#x200B;

Of course, I was hurt. But it did make sense logically. I got taller and the spiking hormones made me much more manly looking. It made sense that they wouldn’t feel like I was a part of their girl group again.Now I’m an undergraduate student, studying computer science. You guys probably can picture it. I’m the most quintessential socially awkward ugly fat guy with a nerdy major. I do have friends, I mean, a friend. One friend. Male.

&#x200B;

Now the reason I decided to start going to the gym, classic enough - I was in love. She was my friend’s sister. Unlike his ugly ass, she’s stunning. She was obviously out of my league. But I’m not that much of a self-destructive man. I do believe I could be attractive if I lose some weight. I might not be one of the funny extroverted guys but I do know how to treat women. My elementary and middle school era taught me a lot.

&#x200B;

It was the university facility gym, and it was 18:00, so I had expected it to be crammed. To be honest, I didn’t even think I would get to do anything on the first day. But to my surprise, including me, there were only four people. Besides me, all of them were females.I didn’t stare at them. I’m not a creep. But I did see two of them running on the treadmill, the remaining one on the bike. I walked awkwardly to a treadmill, the one farthest away from the two girls running. Not having used one before, I turned to speed up to 5 km per hour. At first, it was all fine. It wasn’t too fast. I felt like I could easily finish an hour of walking at this speed. I was wrong. My twenty-years-of-sitting-on-my-ass-all-day body only lasted on that treadmill for about seven minutes before I had to smash the emergency stop button and puffed like crazy. I could feel the three girls looking at me. I even heard some giggling. I was embarrassed to death and went back to my dorm right away. That was my first day at the gym.

&#x200B;

The next day, I hesitated but I did successfully push myself to go, again. It was the same time. And the exact same people were there. I didn’t stare at their faces but I can remember their figures and hair colors. They were also on the same machines. I hopped on the same treadmill, but this time I settled the pace to 3.5 km per hour. It was much better. I was able to finish a 20-minute workout, though I still puffed a lot. As I finished and was going to leave, I heard some giggling again. I didn’t think that had anything to do with me and I left anyway.

&#x200B;

The next day, which was the third day of my gym journey. I didn’t have a class that day, so I decided to go to the gym at 13:00 instead. There I saw the same vision. It felt strange but I just thought - if I could, why couldn’t they? Maybe they just happened to not have class today, just like me. This time I used the bicycle machine. It was much less tiring than walking/running and swiping through social media while sitting like that was much easier to do. So, my workout lasted an hour. I was proud of myself. When I was hopping off the bike, my eyes just happened to accidentally place on the girl biking beside me. She was pretty, literally gorgeous. Long red hair, big blue eyes, and giggling, hard.

&#x200B;

The fourth day. I was too tired, or maybe too lazy, and I didn’t go to the gym. This day I went to my best friend’s room to hang out. I was sitting on the floor as he lay down on his bed, reading comic books.I asked him, “How’s \[his sister’s name\] doing?”

&#x200B;

And he replied, “Taken.”

&#x200B;

I signed, not surprised but still disappointed. I still had hope, though. I knew I could be better than whoever she was dating. All I had to do was lose weight.

&#x200B;

He said, “And how’s your gym journey going?”

&#x200B;

“Great. I can even do an hour of workout, can you believe that?” I smirked proudly.

&#x200B;

“But ain’t there too many people there? I tried going once and just gave up even before stepping in.”

&#x200B;

“I thought there would be a lot too but turns out it’s just me and three hot girls.”

&#x200B;

“Huh?”

&#x200B;

“You can join us.”

&#x200B;

He sat up and looked at me, confused. “What gym did you go to?”

&#x200B;

There was two gyms in our university, same building but different floors, 9th floor and 12th floor. 

&#x200B;

“The 9th floor one”

&#x200B;

His face went pale. “That one was closed a year ago…”

&#x200B;

I scoffed. “Nah. You know I’m not scared of these kinda things and you can’t fool me.”

&#x200B;

He grabbed my shoulder and stared at me seriously. “I’m not fooling, search it if you don’t believe me.”

&#x200B;

Honestly, at that point, I was already scared. If it was just his words alone, I wouldn’t. But deep down I knew something was off too. I had been trying to ignore it but deep down I knew it couldn’t be normal for a university gym to have only three people at around 6 pm.

&#x200B;

I put on a brave face, hiding my whelming fear. “Then what about we just go together now?”

&#x200B;

“No way in hell.”

&#x200B;

“Coward.”

&#x200B;

“Look, I’m serious. I heard that gym was closed because people died there. I don’t know any details but it was really closed. How the fuck did you get in there?

&#x200B;

”Sweats were rolling down my forehead. “I just… walked in.”

&#x200B;

He palms his face. “Whatever. I don’t think you should ever go there again.”

&#x200B;

I didn’t reply to his words. I just shrugged my shoulders and changed the topic. He still looked worried but I figured he probably didn’t want to keep talking about that either.

&#x200B;

The next day, I went to the 12th-floor gym instead. I hadn’t searched about the 9th-floor gym stuff. I wasn’t ready for it. The 12th-floor gym was totally different. There wasn’t any difference in size or number of the equipments, yet this one was really filled with people, like how I had expected on the first day. I did my workout normally. I finished and went back to my dorm. There was no one giggling as I left. Nothing weird happened that day.

&#x200B;

The day after, which is yesterday, I still went to the 12th-floor gym. After I had finished my workout, I stood still in front of the floor buttons in the elevator for a while, wavering whether I should do it or not, should I go to the 9th floor to check again or not.Well, sure it was somehow weird, but not like I ever got hurt there, right? And there weren’t many people like the 12th floor so it felt much more private. I knew I could have just searched on the internet to check out the information, but what would that give me? I could know what happened to the gym, but I wouldn’t know what was happening to me, I would never get to know why must it be me and those three girls and not someone else.

&#x200B;

And I pushed the 9th-floor button.

&#x200B;

It arrived, and it opened, as usual. The gym was also opened. This day I already finished my workout, so it was about 19:30. I looked inside the gym, and there they were. The exact same three girls, all on the exact same machines before. I was not going to work out. I wasn’t there for that reason. I was there because I wanted to know the truth. But I didn’t know what to do. Ask them? At that point, I didn’t even know if they were human or not.

&#x200B;

So, I just stood there stupidly, watching but not going inside. I looked around my surroundings, there weren’t any other people there. I looked in the gym, it’s just like the 12th-floor one, no significant difference. I looked at the girls, they were really beautiful. I even thought - what if I just move on from my friend’s sister and give it a shot with one of them instead? If they were humans, of course. And they did seem like they were. The more I looked, the more attracted I was. I didn’t mean to stare, I knew that would be creepy, but I just couldn’t help myself. Besides their gorgeous faces, their bodies were also all top-tier. Big round tits slightly bouncing as they run and bike, bare skin of the tiny waist area, thick firm asses making me imagine how good would it feel to just push my di—

&#x200B;

Suddenly, the movements stopped, and their eyes were all on me. Their big beautiful eyes had turned mostly white, with a small bit of black eye. They stared at me, not smiling, not giggling, not curious, not a neutral face. Those were enraged faces. As I was still freezing, they started moving again. I don’t know what words I can use to describe them, but it wasn’t natural. It wasn’t smooth movements like how humans do. Their joints and bones were cracking. And they just… started running at me. Yes, they ran. Full speed. And their eyes were still looking straight into mine. They weren’t screaming or yelling anything. Their mouths were shut closed. All I could hear was loud running footsteps and the sounds their interconnecting body parts were making. One of the runners got me first. She jumped on me and pushed me to the ground. The other two followed. I couldn’t see which one did it, but I got kicked in the nuts, hard. Then, they all screamed at me at the same time.

&#x200B;

“Pervert.”

&#x200B;

And they repeated.

&#x200B;

“Pervert.”

&#x200B;

And they repeated again and again.

&#x200B;

“Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert. Pervert.”

&#x200B;

The foot was also repeatedly kicking me. And, this is embarrassing, but unlike most survivors of horror stories, I did not manage to get myself out of there. I was just getting screamed at and kicked in the balls until I passed out.

&#x200B;

This morning, I woke up, I was in a bed. I looked around, there were two people there, my friend and a nurse. And the place was the infirmary room.Before I could open my mouth and say a word, my friend said first. 

&#x200B;

“Could you let us speak privately?”

&#x200B;

And seems like the nurse did understand, she just nodded and left the room.

&#x200B;

He said to me, “What happened?”

&#x200B;

“…I think they were ghosts.”

&#x200B;

“Why the fuck did you go there again?”

&#x200B;

“Curiosity.”

&#x200B;

He signed and palmed his face.

&#x200B;

I asked, “Who found me?”

&#x200B;

“Of course, it’s me, motherfucker. Who else would have known were you could be?”

&#x200B;

I didn’t reply, then he kept asking, “What happened, in detail. When I got there you were just lying in front of the closed gym.”

&#x200B;

“I… I don’t remember.” I lied

&#x200B;

“You just told me you realize they were ghosts.”

&#x200B;

“And that’s all I remember.”

&#x200B;

He signed again. “Whatever.”

&#x200B;

We left it at that and headed back to our dorms. I was spending hours researching and reading the news about the 9th-floor gym before I started typing this post.

&#x200B;

Basically, three girls were gang-raped and murdered in there. There were a dozen of offenders, no one stopped anyone.

&#x200B;

Now I’m really glad he’s my only friend. No one could have been more ignorant.

&#x200B;

But by ignorant I only mean about things considering one’s self. He doesn’t care what you do to yourself that only affects yourself and no one else. But when it comes to social issues, he’s kinda serious, especially gender stuff. Normal for someone with a sister, I guess.

&#x200B;

That’s why I couldn’t tell him what the ghosts did to me. He would question me. And if he knew he would get mad at me for what I’ve done in the past. I don’t think it’s a big deal, but better safe than sorry, I don’t want to lose the only friend I have.I’m not stupid. By their actions and their courses of death, I can already guess why the ghosts chose to attack me. But I won’t lie, I’m a bit offended. Sure, I wasn’t the best guy, I did make some mistakes, I made some people uncomfortable. But to call me a pervert is too much. I was just a bit curious and handsy, isn’t that normal for boys at 15? I did touch some girls but I would never rape anyone. I just touched the ones I was close to as a form of showing platonic affection, don’t girls do that to each other all the time? But I’m not defending my actions here, though. If it makes them uncomfortable then I shouldn’t do it, and I never did it again. I’m just saying that time I did it because I didn’t know. I won’t make those mistakes again. And I hope everyone involved forgets it and forgives me, it’s not for me but for their own sakes. Nothing good comes from fixating on other people’s mistakes and being consumed by grudges. At least that’s what I think.

&#x200B;

And I won’t go to the 9th-floor gym again. Hope the ghosts learn how to forgive too.
