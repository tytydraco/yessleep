You can call me Robert Morse.

For what will become obvious reasons, I’ve been forbidden to speak about my profession in any capacity, all of us are. We know what will happen, that one final action that’s supposed to unlock our deep-set fears of reprisal. There’s no going off-book. We are obedient, and we are silent…supposed to be, anyway. If we do what we’re told, we’re handsomely rewarded. Everything you could ever want…all you have to give in return is your compliance.

So why did I run away?

It’s a long story, truly, one that I will try to put into words here, but it will never describe the full extent of what I did, what we did. That part of my life, where I did some of the most terrifying, inhumane things a person could possibly do and saw things that would mentally break even the most hardened war veterans, is trying to be sealed away forever in the deepest corners of my mind, but it always breaks free, always floats back to the surface and shakes me at the quick of everything that I was. I remember wishing that it would stop, but that was just wishful thinking. It would always be a part of me, whether I liked it or not.

To be frank, I’m “wanted”, I guess you could say, have been for about a year now. Yeah, it was a while ago now, but they don’t give a shit about that. They want me dead, not silent, not imprisoned, dead. Nowadays, especially nowadays, you can be tracked every which way, and trust me, it’s easier than you think. For someone in my current position, you can never be too safe. You keep a low profile, you stay off the internet, you use fake names, you change your appearance, and most of all, you move, you move, move, move. Staying in one spot for long is a fucking death sentence. Right now, I’ve got a place to hold up for a little while. Yes, they’ll be here eventually, but I'll be long gone, and better yet, I’ll be someone new.

There are things in this world that the common man can never hope to understand, things that have no right to exist. People try to gain some logical high ground that they created in their minds with what they call facts, logic, and common sense. They explain the weird and mysterious away with big words and long drawn-out explanations that make their followers go “ooh” and “ahh”, denying every notion that there’s anything else beyond that because…it’s not realistic enough for their own liking?

Let me tell you firsthand, they’re lying, and if they aren’t lying, they’re ignorant, ignorant to what humanity at any moment could be up against. All 8 billion of us? We’re not prepared, not even in the slightest. I know, I know, a man in my position would tell lies to protect his skin, but I’m a truth-teller, one of the last few on Earth. So what I’m about to tell you, it’s one of the most disgusting things I’ve ever seen, but it’s the God’s honest truth, and if you listen, you’ll understand just how deep of a fucking nightmare I went through and am still going through.

I’m going to tell you the tale of how The Rat came into this world, and how we, and I, were involved, and I’m sorry. I’m sorry that I didn’t stop them. I’m sorry that I never saved anybody. I’m sorry that I was a part of it.

Let’s talk about it.

You could’ve called me whatever you wanted, I’m sure all of it would apply. Personally, though, I’d just prefer a collector of sorts. Who we worked for was obvious, but who we really worked for was, you could say, multiple choice. They had a mission, you see. What they wanted was weapons…not weapons as in guns and bombs and artillery, but weapons as in weapons of flesh and blood, the type that can bite, claw, rip, tear, maim…artificial, man-made beasts designed to kill. Theoretically, they would be sold to really anyone who wanted them. Of course their biggest customers would be militaries, from all over the world, but some of these creatures would’ve made their way into the clutches of all the billionaires and capitalists and one-percenters we’ve all come to hate in recent years.

You see, these guys are businessmen, yes, but above all else, they’re scientists, but not the sort you’d see in some godforsaken lab at your local university. No, these are some of the most brilliant minds of this world…minds that should never be allowed to think.

To create these things, what they needed was pure organic material. You know, blood, skin, muscle, tissue, guts, limbs, nerves, you name it…meat…and I was part of one of many teams who provided that. We did the dirty work, and we didn’t have the luxury of a moral compass. To do what we did, we couldn’t have any of that.

Are you getting the picture yet?

You have to understand how the creation of these things worked. The scientists would create their designs…take whatever creature or creature-like design they wanted…and create the basic structure of it. The rest? Well they couldn’t manufacture the flesh and blood required to make the things truly alive. A body without inner workings is just a doll. So they’d get us to “round up” a victim. Yes, you read that correctly. Humans.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that humanity is a resource to be tapped into, and it’s one that goes to waste when it’s not taken advantage of. We had a variety of methods for our job, ranging from the subtle, to the violent, but all of them were disgusting and sickening in their own way. We would follow and stalk the victims, or we would abduct them at random. We would then transport them to some kind of safe house and wait for the extraction team to arrive. It all went down quickly after that. We’d knock them out…inject them…take all the parts we needed…I mean, all of it.

We didn’t just deal with live humans though. It could be any living creature. You know, you had your rabbits, your foxes, your deer, your dogs, your cats…your rats…you name it. These creatures would just die and decompose naturally, or we would take them alive when we could, however we could. I could only imagine people’s faces when their beloved pets were gone. We’d get as many live ones as we could, they’re in better condition anyway. The better the condition, the better the quality of flesh that you get. All of our subjects, human or otherwise, were kept in crates or cages until we had all we needed. Sometimes we had to put humans and animals together…lots of accidents.

God…the place we held them at…you can probably imagine the smells, rancid, stinking, stale. So many people, so many animals, in that cramped of a space, I’ve never smelled anything worse in my life. Even the dead bodies I’ve been accustomed to smelled better than that. But really, the only thing worse was the noise. It was a dreadful cacophony of suffering between all of our permanent residents. The humans made the most noise, they yelled, they cried, a lot of them pissed and shat themselves, and the children, oh boy the children, they would never shut the fuck up. Usually they were first in line to get some monocum of peace and quiet. Of course, though, all of them would be drowned out by the sounds of the other animals who were none the wiser to their fates.

And before they knew it, it was time.

To be honest, I never knew the exact process required to create what they were trying to create. It was only for the scientists, bioengineers, and other fucks behind those closed doors to know and for us, the measly collectors and the cattle to the slaughter if anything went haywire, to never find out. Our only job at that point was to throw them inside and leave, maybe guard the door if some parent tried to be a hero and save their kid. However, we did get to see the end products…and I’ve seen all manners of them. Initially, most of them were just hybrids. Like cats with foxes, pigs with wolves, humans with dogs, that sort of thing, but later they progressed to totally new and original creatures…well…that was the intention anyway. A lot of them died pretty early on. If an experiment failed, I and a few others had to go in and retrieve them, and let me tell you, nothing could’ve prepared me for what I was about to see.

Their bodies were a nightmare, a mess, contorted into shapes that would never have happened in nature…their organs and guts had melted together or spilled out in pools of fluids…the flesh, it was stretched, distorted, or missing altogether, not only in their faces but all over, and those were just the ones we got to in time. The ones we didn’t…they just laid there, their bodies still and lifeless, yet every now and again, their dead eyes would open up as if to mock us, their keepers, for wasting our time with something so foul and which yielded no results. Yeah, our job was to dispose of them.

You couldn’t even tell what the subjects originally were anymore. You’d have to go in with your own eyes to truly understand what we were dealing with. It was beyond nightmarish. Of course, not all of them died. There were the ones that survived, just barely. Even then, we had to exterminate some of them for one reason or another. Since they were imbued with the desire to kill, let’s just say no one could be in the same room as them without being torn to shreds. There were a lot of accidents. Even the ones that weren’t as hostile at first, when they were put in their cells, they would start to fight, scratch, and gnaw at the walls, at themselves…you could see the stress building and exploding out of them.

Eventually, I’d seen the things we created go on murderous rampages inside those cages, ripping each other limb from limb in fits of blood-lust. But with all that being said, the scientists still counted each one as a victory. They would study and evaluate the results of the experiments, taking everything into account and trying to replicate the results, if they were beneficial. If the experiments didn’t go well…they would try to figure out what went wrong and attempt to fix it. Through trial and error, they got better at it.

That’s where The Rat came in.

No, it wasn’t a rat-human hybrid. In another life, it was an ordinary gray rat picked off a city street late at night. The scientists had big plans for it though. It was a creature designed to create a new type of horror. They’d already created so many things that tried to kill, but this…this was different. You see, what they were trying to accomplish with The Rat was to create something to study. Instead of looking for a pure predator or something that looked like a man-made killing machine, they wanted something they could completely control, or at least influence, to do what they wanted. It was their pet. They thought that they could do it. Hell, they thought that they could do anything.

But they ended up getting the complete opposite.

The scientists put a lot of effort into this thing. They wanted to ensure that it was just a large enough creature, a perfect size, not too big, not too small. They also wanted it to be…how do I say it…perfectly ugly. They wanted it to just radiate malice from the inside out, just looking at it, you’d want to run the fuck away. A lot of the others had a certain “gore” to them that the scientists thought could be off-putting, but in reality they were just so shocking and strange looking that you couldn’t look away. This thing? No, they had a completely different strategy.

When I saw The Rat for the first time, I remember just feeling…disgust. That was it, nothing else. The Rat was the epitome of human filth, a veritable human dump, a sewer of every sickness imaginable, a rotting corpse, a putrid abomination…a monster. It was…a fucking rat, nothing more, nothing less. Nothing could ever be more disgusting or repulsive than a rat. I knew it the moment I saw it. I’d only gotten to see it for a moment, just a glimpse, but I can remember how I felt for as long as I live. Seeing that thing was something that just shook me to my core.

Maybe it would’ve completely resembled their perfect brainchild, but it was evidently clear that there was some problems.

Firstly, it didn’t stop eating. All of us watched it eat…it didn’t make a sound, no matter what it ate. Just ate, and kept eating. It didn’t fight the other creatures or try to escape, it just stayed put, eating. We watched it consume dogs, cats, pigs, horses, and yeah, humans. We had to get new food all the time, even some of our would-be test subjects. It would just…eat. What you can’t digest, you have to puke up, right? It didn’t. It just kept eating.

So that was problem number one. It wasn’t really a problem at all. It wouldn’t bite or attack anyone, as long as we gave it food, so that was good at least. Another problem was the noise. It would never shut up, just squeaking or hissing or howling or whatever noise it could possibly make. At first, the scientists didn’t know why it was doing this, but after enough of it happening, it became clear, which was actually our third problem with it: The Rat wanted to die.

It was gorging itself because it was depressed as hell. All the time, it tried to end its own miserable existence in every way it could think of…by eating, by trying to cut itself on the razor wires of its cage, by trying to throw itself out of its window, by just mutilating its own body by clawing at its fur. Sometimes we’d find it on the other side of its cage with its face against the glass, all bloodied up, just staring back at us…or we’d find it on the other side of the cage, looking like it was dead, hanging by its neck…

All of our creatures wanted to kill, but I’ve never seen one just wanting to die.

So why didn’t we just kill it? Well, besides the scientist’s insistence on keeping it alive and well, we just…couldn’t kill it. These things weren’t like the failed hybrid abominations we were making before, just barely clinging onto the thread of life. No, The Rat, and many others in the deepest depths of that facility…they’re invincible. Remember, the scientists wanted unstoppable killing machines, and that’s what they got. The Rat, however, had been kept in some kind of limbo. All it wanted to do was die.

By now, you should have a pretty good understanding of my profession at the time. I’m not gonna sit here and pretend like I was a good person and was forced into it by men in suits who held my family at gunpoint if I didn’t play along. None of us could say something like that without being a liar. I’m a bad person, and though I’ve had time to perhaps correct my mistakes…well, they were never mistakes to begin with. I knew what I was doing all along. Does that make me the bad guy? Yes, yes it does. I’m not saying that I didn’t have times where I hesitated or really thought about what I was doing, I’m just saying that there were other times where I felt a whole lot worse. Our subjects were just flesh and blood…there’s nothing to them besides that. At the same time though, I felt like something was breaking inside me.

No, it wasn’t as if I was suddenly growing a conscience and morals. It was more like I was a shell, a hollow, concave shell of a man. I didn’t care anymore about anything, the would-be subjects screaming for help, their sad puppy-dog eyes staring back at me, nothing. I didn’t have those moments of hesitation or being lost in thought for a split-second anymore. Nothing, like static on an old television. If you saw what I saw every single day of your life, you would go insane. It’s too much for the brain to comprehend and subsequently store for future recall, which is why I did what I did. I don’t want this part to be interpreted as me being some underdog who tried to step up to the big mean villains in an act of selfless heroics. I didn’t give a shit about that. By this point, I had lost my mind completely. I was angry…at who? I don’t know. The scientists? My fellow collectors? The creatures? The Rat? I know what I’m going to describe next is absolutely ridiculous and quite stupid honestly, but I did it. I thought it would return my mind to the way it was before.

It didn’t. It was like doing a puzzle with a broken mirror. Yeah you can put it back together, but the cracks are always there, reminding you that it broke in the first place, and there was no hope in putting it back together.

That night, that warm summer night, I had a mission. It was one that I was planning for a while now, and I had to make sure the conditions were absolutely perfect. I could not afford to mess this shit up, the stupidest thing I’ve ever done. Mind my own business, no eye contact, no sudden moves, just the same routine I’d done hundreds of times by that point. You’d be surprised how easy it is to blend in just about anywhere. All you really have to do is not be stupid. Each cage was controlled electronically; all possessed their own unique codes, and even those were changed weekly. And not just one person could open them. Like bank vaults, it was a team effort to just get one open. All of that, though…none of it mattered. Of course, there was a way to override this and open all of them at once, only requiring myself. Each of us knew the code that would reveal the big red button, but of course, we never had to use it for anything, and if we did, we could look forward to that “fear of reprisal” I was talking about earlier. You never know though, and that definitely rang true that night.

Making my way past screaming victims, monstrous shreeks, angry, hateful, and inhumane growls, and the stench of death and decay, to the “control room” if you want to call it that. I’d been there before. It wasn’t a big room or anything. That night, no one was in there, to my luck, besides two guards standing outside the door. Approaching them, I knew what had to be done. They weren’t hard to take down either. I mean, I had much more experience than them when it came to combat. It was my job to round up unwilling pawns and send them to their grisly fates here at this facility, but what did they do? They stood there all day not doing much, not that they had to anyway.

No one was stupid enough to perpetrate the events that were about to unfold, besides me. They both go down quite easy. I didn’t make a single sound, and I dragged their unconscious bodies to secure locations. I typed in the first code - 395fjeken59405mfndiei4. A bunch of gibberish, yes, but quite unknowable. It wasn’t your password1234. Opening up the door and shutting it behind me very quietly, I didn’t marvel at all the screens, the security cameras showing the creatures, the guards, the scientists, just about every square inch of the facility, or the other monitors with data, charts, readouts, and other information on them. I didn’t think about what I was doing at all, I just went and did it.

I got to work, typing away on the keyboard, getting through firewall after firewall. I actually brought the small notepad I was using to collect all the information I needed. It was taking quite a long time, and with every second passing, every slight knock or thump, I thought I was busted, but no, that never happened, somehow. To this day, I’m still surprised that the guards didn’t bust open the door and shoot me on site. Before I knew it, I was sitting and staring at the big red button labeled RELEASE ALL CONTAINMENT. I began breathing heavily, shaking uncontrollably, and for the first time in a long time, I began to somewhat think. Right as all these thoughts flooded my mind, ones that involved a lot of carnage, bloodshed, annihilation…blood and guts filling the halls of this god-forsaken place, I heard someone outside yell “Hey!” and all those thoughts rushed out of my mind once more.

I hit the button.

Every cage, every door, slowly creaked open, all of them in unison. Immediately, the alarms began to blare, coloring the entire building crimson. I saw everyone looking around confused, and others were panicking. Even if you didn’t know what those alarms meant, you could take a wild guess. Most of the creatures burst out of their doors, ready to kill anyone in sight, and that they did. Everyone was running for their lives, some of them ripped away and devoured by an unsightly beast. Male, female, old, young, didn’t matter…they were ripped apart, torn limb for limb, swallowed hole…I saw a mom get ripped away from her husband and son and get torn in two, spilling so much blood out of both ends and completely drenching the creature now devouring her.

Two guards tried to shoot at this big yellow blob of a creature but it shot this…acid? or something out of its mouth, completely reducing them to bone, and then dissolving the bone, leaving only slicks of skin behind on the ground. This bat thing with a face full of fangs picked up a scientist and flew him high up, pinned him against a wall, and began eating at his face, leaving behind a gaping maw where the mouth and nose should’ve been. All the screams were drowned out by those of the animals, who of course weren’t spared. I saw dogs, cats, what have you getting devoured, thrown and tossed all over the place, crushed under falling debris.

I did nothing. No thoughts came to me as I watched all of this unfold. What threw me back to reality was the sight of something on CAM 35A peeking its head out of its cage…it was The Rat. I saw it look around, not an ounce of fear or anything on its face. Its big eyes went from side to side until they finally rested on me, through the camera. We stared at each other for a few moments. It pushed open its door and came out on all fours. Squinting at me, it made a sound with its mouth, which I couldn’t hear because of all the chaos, before scampering down the hallway, out of view. For some reason, seeing that made me wake up a bit. I did hear over the intercom to evacuate, followed by screams and muffled gibberish. Guess they got eaten too. I ran out of the control room, right into Hell.

I didn’t stand around waiting to get eaten though, especially as I saw one of the lead scientists crawling on the floor…he was on fire, his skin burning to a crisp, his charing fingers struggling to get a grip on the floor beneath him. He was yelling out “HELP ME!”, his voice rough and guttural. Actually, I don’t even know if he was yelling that. I think he was just screaming nonsense at that point. I didn’t help him though. I only cared about my escape, and besides, what the hell was I gonna do? I heard a big crash, and then something screeched down the hall and pulled the lead scientist away. I didn’t get a clear view of it, but it was big, scaly, reptilian...it was almost dinosaur-like. The screech almost burst my eardrums, and it resonated throughout not just my body, but the entire building. It was time to get the fuck out of there.

I know…I know…I’m the asshole…I don’t need reminding of that. Every day I beat myself up in more ways than one. I’ve contemplated suicide, even almost followed through on some attempts. I can’t, though, not that I don’t want to, it’s just that I can’t. Something’s stopping me…I don’t know what. I know they’re tracking me. They know it was me, and now the whole world does too. This entire year, I’ve been debating hard with myself whether to post this or not, but life, it’s all about risk. Risk is what we took…and now, risk is what I’m taking. I’m just doing what I do best, taking risks. I have to expose them for who they really are.

You can’t find anything about what happened online, or probably anywhere else for that matter. That’s been totally scrubbed clean. Don’t even bother looking.

Some of the creatures died in all that chaos…but only the ones that were weak and not built to last. The rest? They all got away. They’re out there, and I’m already seeing stories, pictures, videos…I know each and every one…The Rat of course…Fang Face…The Stare…Winnie…Nibbler…Good Dog…all of them. I implore whoever is reading this, don’t even try to kill them. You can’t, not just because they’re invincible, but they’re also bigger than you, stronger than you, faster than you, smarter than you. They have special abilities. They don’t get tired or bored. All they want to do is kill, kill, kill. Oh god…I’m afraid a global catastrophe is on our hands. It’s not a matter of if, but when. Try to nuke them, see what happens…We’re never safe in this world, trust me. As humans, we like to think we’re invincible, that we can take anything on, but there are things in this world, in this universe, that humble us, make us look tiny, like little insects. We’re nothing. You? Me? We are completely and utterly nothing.

Even as I type this, I still think of The Rat…it was different than the rest. All those infinite hours of watching it try to kill itself, but being unable. For some reason, that made me feel a connection to it. Not on some deep personal level, but that we were at least on the same wavelength. I know what it is now. Pain is all the both of us know, and all we’ll ever know. Death is waiting for us, but it seems like he’ll have to keep waiting.

I’ve been online for more hours than I’m willing to count at this point…I’m exhausted…I haven’t eaten, drank anything, or bathed…I’ve been researching The Rat, everything I can find. I’ve got notes everywhere, drawings I’ve made…the images online…that’s fucking it. That’s The Rat. My heart skips a beat every time I see it. I can’t look at it for long. Apparently, according to two stories I’ve found online, it seems some guy encountered it while driving home late at night…and then it broke into his house and killed his cat. Another guy’s saying that it killed his neighbors….I can’t say I’m surprised, but I do wanna know more. No, I don’t want to…I NEED to. I think I’m gonna mess-
