I’m a Machine Learning Algorithm developer who work from home. I live alone, except for Tom, my adorable little dog. About a month ago, while I was working, I received a call from an unknown number. Curious, I picked it up.

“Hey, it’s Sam. How are you doing?” the voice on the other end said.

Sam was my college friend, someone I hadn’t spoken to in nearly ten years. Surprised, I asked him why he was calling out of the blue.

“Are you home tonight? I’ve got an urgent errand nearby, and it would really help if I could crash at your place. What do you say?” he asked.

Of course, I agreed. “Sure, come over. I’ll even prepare dinner for you,” I said.

That evening, I wrapped up my work early and prepared a nice meal, complete with a bottle of whiskey. By around 9 PM, Sam arrived. We exchanged hugs, and before dinner, we reminisced about our college days, laughing and chatting about old times.

I offered Sam a drink, but he declined the whiskey and opted for wine instead. Tom, my dog, was behaving oddly—something I’d never seen before. He’s usually calm even when my parents or other guests visit, but this time, he seemed restless around Sam. Still, I didn’t think much of it.

Sam seemed tired after dinner. “I think I’ll turn in for the night,” he said, heading to the guest room. I stayed up for a bit longer and eventually went to bed around midnight.

At 5:23 AM, I heard a knock at my door. Groggy, I checked the time before opening it. There stood Sam, fully dressed and ready to leave.

“I need to catch a train,” he explained hurriedly. “It’s been a hard time for me, but I promise I’ll come back and spend more time with you—and maybe with some of our old friends too.”

Without waiting for a proper goodbye, he left. I went back to bed, puzzled by his abrupt departure. Later that day, I tried calling the number he used to contact me, but it was disconnected. I tried several times, to no avail.

Sam, Marcus, Andrew, and I had been close friends during our college days. We had our fair share of mischiefs and good times—something I missed dearly in my current mundane routine. Everything felt simpler back then.

Yesterday, I happened to run into Marcus at Walmart. After catching up, we started talking about old memories. As the conversation drifted, I mentioned Sam.

“Sam? Why are you asking about him?” Marcus asked, looking confused.

“What do you mean? You don’t remember Sam? He came to my place about a month ago,” I replied.

“Are you joking?” Marcus looked puzzled. “We never had a friend named Sam.”

I laughed nervously. “Marcus, don’t mess with me. You, me, Andrew, and Sam—we were inseparable in college!”

But Marcus stood firm. “I swear, I don’t know any Sam.”

Shaken, I decided to call Andrew. When I asked him about Sam, his reaction was similar. “Who’s Sam? What are you talking about?”

Now, I was starting to feel unsettled. Was this some elaborate prank? I decided to reach out to Natalie, another friend from college. She didn’t know Sam either.

I grew desperate. I scoured my old college yearbooks, searched the alumni directories, and even checked every social media platform for traces of him. Nothing. Not a single mention of Sam anywhere.

Finally, I checked our college’s official website, which listed every student from our graduating year. There was no record of a Samuel Johnson—or anyone remotely matching his description.

Who was Sam? Was he ever real? The memories I had of him, the night he spent at my place—they felt so vivid, so tangible. But now, I’m questioning everything. Who came to my house that night? And why does he exist only in my mind?
