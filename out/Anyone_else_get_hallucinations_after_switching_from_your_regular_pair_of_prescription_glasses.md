Anyone else get hallucinations after switching from your regular pair of prescription glasses? Since I(17m) can remember I have been wearing prescription glasses. My mom always told me to wear it every time before I go outside my room. When I asked her why, she told me I used to have Strabismus (cross-eye), and being a kid I was terrified my eyes would revert back so I have been wearing it ever since. I didn’t even question it. She always told me no matter what happens, do not leave my room without wearing my glasses. Even though wearing it frequently gives me migraine, I didn’t wanna disappoint my mother.

For context I guess let me tell you about my complicated relationship with my mom. My siblings and I (1 brother 1 sister, i’m the oldest) were all homeschooled. I remember this particular argument with my mom. When I was around 12 i insisted to going to a “normal” school, about 30 minutes bus from where we live. This turned into a screaming match. She screamed to my face “YOU WILL NOT LEAVE THIS HOUSE” in a deep, scratchy voice that I have never heard my mother speak before. I was crying and felt scared at this point, I said “you’re a monster” and went to my room. Later that day she went to my room, and… she just sat there for an uncomfortable amount of time, then left. I didn’t look at her as I was crying and hiding under my blanket. 

When I went to the kitchen to grab some food, she was sitting on one of the dining chairs. When I looked at her face, she was like a whole different person. Her demeanour changed. I don’t know how else I would describe it. But she was glaring at me and smiling at me at the same time. Then, I don’t know for whatever reason, she agreed to me going in a public school. But there was this unspoken thing between us that I would not go out more than necessary for school. She didn’t outright forbade me to go out after school hours but she might as well have. because I always receive the unnerving glare/smile when I stay out a little longer than usual(bus not on time etc.) Scared that I will be homeschooled again, I did not risk it. So I wake up, go to school, study, soon as the bell rang, home. I didn’t even talk to anybody (the best I could). 

Since this incident, my siblings and I drifted apart. I always told myself they’re mad and it’s because I chose to go somewhere else for school and left them. I was not really close to any of them, but now they just outright ignore me, straight up stare at me kinda eerily when I try to talk to them. Have you ever entered a room and somehow you just know they’ve been talking about you? So yeah. Add that to the creepy stares, I just avoid both of them in general. So because of a lot of combination of these things, I grew up not very sociable. I was afraid someone would tease me or some shit, so I just keep to myself most of the time. I felt alone most of middle school to high school. 

But over the years I only had 1 real friend I made. His name is Jake. He is a social butterfly so I assumed he was just being nice (I still think he is) and I was shocked when he told me he wants to be my friend as everyone usually just calls me a loser and ignore me. When I turned 17 (yesterday) I sneaked out to go to Jake’s house. He invited me to have dinner with his family and gave me 50 bucks as a gift. During dinner, Jake’s parents asked a lot of questions about me out of curiosity. Somehow the conversation turned about my family, what do they do, who’s your parents etc. I did answer them but all I can give them is curt replies. His dad asked “do you have a family picture?” so I said “We don’t really take them.” because it’s true. We don’t really take them. Have no idea why. I don’t think we even have one family photo hanging anywhere around the house. Not even a photo of just us, mom and siblings. I don’t even really know who my father was. At one point I felt like I was adopted. I want to ask my mom about it but she might just become mad at me again. 

Back to dinner, at that point it was getting awkward. Jake, trying to change the subject, asked me, “since when have you been wearing your glasses?” so I told him ever since I was a kid. So he said “oh, cool. did the eye doctor make you look at the hot air balloon and letters and stuff?” and I just shrugged it off like Pfft. yeah. But it got me wondering, huh. I have never been checked by an optometrist before. like ever. My mom just kind of hands me a new pair of glasses when mine don’t fit anymore. The vibes at the dinner table were just so awkward. And I couldn’t really blame them because I don’t even know myself why I am weird and why my family feels weird. I have always thought our behaviour is what it is because we were all homeschooled.

After dinner, we said our goodbyes. Jake’s parents gave me a hug and wished me happy bday. They’re good folks. Jake insisted he drive me home. I never told anyone where I live because it was pretty remote and, honestly, i’m a bit embarrassed. During the drive back, I apologized for being awkward. He said no big deal. Then I opened up to him and basically told him pretty much what I said here. All he can say after was “well. shit.” and we both just started laughing, because of the absurdity of the situation or because he feels bad for me, I don’t even know.  But he did tell me “I still don’t get the glasses thing. Have you tried not to wear them? is your vision blurry?” And I was honest with him. Told him i’m afraid my mom would find out as she was really adamant about me wearing it. Because of his insistence, I took em off and it was… normal. Everything looks the same. I don’t even have blurry vision. At this point I was left with a lot of questions and my head is hurting a bit. He told me my glasses could be the reason of my frequent migraines. You know, at this point I was starting to agree with him. It was starting to dawn on me that my whole life situation is bizarre. 

So before he drove me back home, he suggested we went to a local pharmacy and I bought a bottle of Advil and one of those cheap prescription glasses that has/looks the same as my pair, which is a semi-thick black plastic frame. I made sure that the frame looks like my regular pair. He finally dropped me off in front of my house around 1am. He initially insisted to come with me at the door and explain to my mom, but I already knew I was in big trouble because of sneaking out tonight and I didn’t wanna drag him.  We said goodbye and said see ya on Monday.

As I opened our front door, the atmosphere feels eerie. I was still wearing the cheap reading glasses when I entered the house. The lights are off everywhere but the kitchen where our dining table was. Everyone; my mom and my siblings, were sitting around the table. I almost did a double take when I saw them. 

They look… off. Uncanny even. There is something about their faces that makes it look quite nonhuman. Initially I was ready to have my back and forth with my mom. But they were all just there. Sitting. Looking like their eyes are bulging out. I can see every vein on their forehead poking out. My mom asked me “Where have you been, Daniel?” but I was too stunned to speak. Then my little brother started laughing. there’s always something unusual about his laugh. It was sort of an unrhythmic, erratic laugh. A laugh that would make you embarrassed if you’ve heard it at the grocery store. Laugh that under different circumstances becomes an ammunition for teasing. It might be that I became used to it as I hear it weekly but, added to the unsettling situation it freaks me the fuck out. Then my sister and my mom joined him and started laughing as well. I excused myself to go to my bedroom, which is in our attic. I didn’t wanna share my space with anyone. And i was starting to appreciate my past self for doing so.

The situation got worse today. When I woke up it was already noon. I headed towards the kitchen. The house is quiet. I was pretty sure I was the only one at the house. I decided to wear my usual glasses again, just to see if it did give me migraines. It did start to give me a headache, but as I was making a bowl of cereal, my mom popped up outta nowhere. She looks like her usual self, which was a relief. She then told me to get ready as we are visiting my grandparents tonight. Now I have never met my grandparents. I have always assumed that they were dead as my mom doesn’t really talk about other members of the family. I didn’t know I still had them until that moment. And we never really go out anywhere so this is really strange. I couldn’t ask her all the questions I wanted to ask as I was still trying to wrap my head around what happened yesterday so I just nodded along and said yeah, sure. I asked where my siblings were, she said “they were already at the farm” Okay. Grandparents. Farm. Great. I didn’t even try to question that even though I want to point out badly that none of this makes sense. So I went to take a quick shower. I brought my small satchel with me to bring my advil and the cheap pair of glasses from the drugstore to swap out my regular pair.

We drove for about 2 hours with our beat-down minivan my mom uses to go to work. I drifted off until we reached a secluded farmhouse. I have no idea why the outside looks dreary even though the sun is blazing out. Two figures were standing at the porch. My mom said there they were. They look too young to be grandparents. I was greeted by a hug from both of them. I was so uncomfortable that it feels like they were suffocating me from their squeeze. We went inside the house and my siblings were already there. 

The house looks old. Three bedroom house. The decorations look like they were from the 80s or some shit. The wooden floorboards were squeaky from every step. I looked around and again, no photographs. My guard was in an all-time high ever since we came here. Hell, even yesterday back home my guard is up. My mother told me to settle in as we would spend the night here at their place. All I wanted was to gauge my eye out. I fucking hate this. My “grandma” told me to check out the room I am staying at. I am going to have to share the room with my brother. I entered the room and there is a small bunk bed and a small nightstand in the room. It was also connected to a small bathroom. I decided to take the top bunk. I was feeling unwell so I stayed at the top bunk until the dinner was ready. 

I heard a knock. It was my sister letting me know the dinner was ready. I wanted to use the bathroom but my brother was in there. When they called me from downstairs, I went switched out my regular pair to the one I brought cause I couldn’t take my migraine anymore then went towards the kitchen. As I walked down the hallway, I could hear them all talking about something, all I can hear is they are mumbling about how I am almost *ready* to be harvested. At this point I don’t trust myself because I thought I am hearing things. Last night I was practically hallucinating seeing things. Then, once I descended to the kitchen, the hallucinations started again. But this time it’s even worse. 

My mom. Her face looks like a badly worn skin suit. Her eye sockets seem to be misaligned but her eyeballs were bulging out of it. The only word I can describe her is a skincrawler. Then my sister. and my “grandparents”. they all look the same. Terrifying. I feel like I am going to throw up. I don’t know what is happening. So I just stood there all frozen again. I was so scared. They asked me if I was alright. I just stood there for what felt like a lifetime, then i heard creaking steps coming from behind. my brother showed up behind me. He was holding out my satchel and took my regular pair of glasses out. shit. I looked at my brother, he had a terrifying facial expression that I cannot begin to describe. I too stunned to say something. He then said, with a smidge of amusement in his voice “Mom, look. Daniel has a new pair of glasses”. 

I know I am screwed. I can’t look my mom in the eye, partly because of the guilt, but mostly because she looks terrifying. My “mom” then slowly said, *”which pair are you wearing right now.”* 

and I just bolted into my room. I pushed my little brother aside as I rushed to go upstairs. I locked the door and blocked it with the small nightstand. Then I heard loud screeches and banging from the other side of the door. My “mom” is saying something, something I couldn’t make out from all the screeching noises. It kinda sounds like *it wasn’t supposed to be like this* or something. Her voice sounds exactly like the voice I’ve heard from that one argument we’ve had.

Currently I am sitting inside the bathroom. The whole incident happened about an hour ago. I am pretty sure they already opened the bedroom door as I can hear them all outside. They keep telling me to come out and they want to talk to me. But I don’t trust them. at the same time I don’t trust myself. I have no idea what’s real anymore. They’re currently rattling the door knob. I have no idea if this is post is even about the glasses at this point.

All I can see from where I am is a small sliding window leading to outside. I am thinking on escaping but I don’t know what I will do if they found out about that. I don’t even know if I can squeeze outta there in time without getting noticed. 

What if I am just hallucinating? I guess I just wanted to ask if anybody else has experienced this, because I feel like I’m losing my fucking mind
