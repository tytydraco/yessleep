I once lived in a trailer park when I was a child over in rural West Virginia. 

It was a nice little place, and was near a cow farm. There were other people that moved in and out of there frequently, so for the most part, my family and I lived alone there.

My room was stationed near the far end of the large single wide trailer and my parents on the other end. 

I had a closet that took up a good portion of my room along with a window right next to my bed. If I were to measure this room, it was no bigger than a closet you would find in a much bigger house. 

I remember so vividly that September night when it was time to go to bed, the sound of crickets outside my window and owls making their noises near the trees further away.

It was late September and the nights were getting a tad crisp. 

I was woken up to feeling a cool breeze coming through my window. Looking at it, I stand up on my bed and shut the window.

I go back to bed. A second time, I am woken up by the breeze coming through my window. Yet again, I stand up and this time lock the window.

A third time, the breeze wakes me up, only this time it feels as if I was placed into a walk in cooler, or a refrigerator. My room is cold. I slam the window shut and go to open my door to my room. 

That’s when I feel it. I can’t explain it other than that feeling you’re not alone in a room, or you’re being watched. The hairs rose on my arms and neck as if I were near electric current.

I turn towards my bed and my door shuts itself behind me with a soft click.

My room is dark. With only the soft dim light of my window eliminating my room.

I turn towards my door hearing it click and try to open it, but it will not budge as if someone from the other side is gripping the handle. 

I try to call out but the shivers I get barely make my voice an audible squeak. It’s as if the air in the room is making my voice raspy. I am for certain I must be dreaming or having a panic attack. 

I pinch myself and I am awake, as I try the door one more time, I hear scratching at the base of my door. But again my door refuses to budge. 

I then feel a stronger sensation behind me, and hear the faint sound of my bed springs creaking under pressure. 

It is when I turn around I see the impression of something on my bed. As if an invisible bowling ball were there.

 As I get closer, I hear breathing. Faint. Almost nonexistent. I hold my breath and still, I can hear it.

I look and see two eyes looking back at me.
Were they glowing? Yes, but the glow was faint just like the breathing. 

At first I felt perhaps it was something on my wall giving me the illusion of what I saw.

But then, they moved. They moved and the impression on my bed moved with it. 

They were pupil-less, red, and had such a faint glow to them it almost resonated into my soul when they looked at me.

I had a small wooden tee ball bat near my closet. I do not know what caused me to act, I was scared and felt like I was going to die, but I took a swing at them regardless of my fear.

I don’t know what scared me more, the fact they were there or the fact my bat connected with whatever it was splitting my bat up the middle in the process.

My hands stung and the room got suspiciously warm as the eyes left my bed and faded from existence.

My door clicked and I turned towards it. It could be opened now and as I did so I saw my dog looking at the window at something passing by. When it passed, my dog turned and came to my side. He did not growl, did not whine, he simply watched.. like a dog would a bird.

I went to bed, my dog jumped on my bed.
I didn’t get much sleep that night and my dog never stopped watching the window.


Years go by and I have a daughter, she turned eight and on the phone she told me of when “it” watched her. 

A shadowy figure, everywhere she went in her mother’s home, it followed. 

Since her mother and I were divorced and living in separate houses miles apart, all I could do was listen. 

 As she explained its appearance and how it was in broad daylight, she then added one detail that struck me to my core. The being had faint red eyes.
