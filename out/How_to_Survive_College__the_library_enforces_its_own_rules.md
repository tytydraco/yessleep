Maria wants to be kept updated on the whole [Daniel situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13huynb/how_to_survive_college_i_have_a_name_and_a/).  No - scratch that - she feels obligated to stay informed.  She certainly doesn’t want updates in the sort of way that you want to eat ice cream.  Rather, she’s keeping track of the situation sort of like how you keep track of a leak in the basement or a particularly stubborn toenail fungus.

I’m kind of sad I’m not using code names anymore because Toenail Fungus would be a great one for Daniel.  Is it too late to go back?  Has Daniel lost first-name privileges with ya’ll?

I probably shouldn’t make this any more confusing than it already is.

When I updated Maria on how my conversation with the flickering man went, I also told her about the incident with the geology building ghost.  At the mention of his name, Maria’s eyes lit up.  I recognized the look on her face.  It was the Rain Chaser Maria expression, when someone handed her a shiny tidbit of information like a new toy.

“Do you think his disappearance was in the news?”

She wasn’t asking me.  She was speculating out loud.  I sat there, staring morosely at my keyboard.  We were in my dorm room. Cassie was out somewhere, I don’t know where, but she’d taken the petrified wood with her so I wasn’t worried.

“If it wasn’t in the town newspaper,” she continued, “it might be in the student one.  Look him up online!”

“James is a very common name,” I replied.

  
She stared at me for a moment, her jaw stubbornly set, and when I didn’t move to open up a browser she pulled out her phone and started searching herself.  I waited.  She’d give up in a moment.  There was no way this would be written down anywhere, not with the administration working to cover everything up and with students forgetting the ones that vanished.

  
“Let’s go to the library,” she said, tossing the phone aside.

  
“This was only ten years ago.  They’re not going to have any books that’ll help us.”

  
“No, but they do have archives of the local newspapers, including the articles that weren’t posted online or have since been taken down.  I just want to see if there’s anything interesting that happened in the timeframe that James went missing.  It was right before graduation, so that narrows it down to just a few months worth of searching.”

  
It was actually a decent idea.  However, I didn’t want her to follow through on it, so to stall for time while I thought of a way to dissuade her I told her I didn’t want to go to the library.  That it made me nervous.

  
It wasn’t a great tactic but I never claimed to be good at thinking on my feet.

  
“What are you scared of?” she demanded.  “If the library floods, we’ll just leave.  No messing around.  I promise.”

  
“It’s not that,” I said.  I’m not worried about the library itself.”

  
I hesitated.  I hadn’t told her about the administration’s involvement.  I’m pretty sure I’ve told her some of my suspicions, because we’ve speculated on how the university has hidden all of this, but I’m pretty sure I didn’t tell her how the flickering man has confirmed there’s someone watching over all the inhumans, because then I’d have to tell her about the flickering man’s grudge and I am not getting her involved in that.

  
I hesitated long enough that Maria grew impatient waiting for me to decide.

  
“Ashley,” she said and there was a faint edge to her voice, “I thought we were better friends than this.”

  
“I’m just worried!” I blurted out.  “I’m afraid I’m going to get you killed if I tell you something I shouldn’t!”

  
“Okay, but have you considered that maybe I could get killed by not knowing something?  Aren’t you the one writing up a list of rules for people to follow?”

  
“That’s different,” I mumbled.

  
It is, isn’t it?  I’m not telling them everything.  I’m just putting in enough information to be memorable and sound ominous, in the hopes they’ll remember what to do if the time comes.

  
“Didn’t your therapist talk to you about this?” Maria said.

  
I shifted uncomfortably in my seat.  So you’re not the only people I’ve talked to about my on-going therapy and how I’m trying to stop blaming myself for things I can’t control.  I just didn’t expect Maria to throw it back in my face like this.

  
Rude.

  
“Listen,” Maria said patiently.  “If I get killed by a monster, it’ll be my own fault for pursuing this stuff.  The only way you’ll be to blame is if you, I don’t know, trade my life for eldritch powers or something, which you’re not about to do.  And honestly, if what you want to tell me has the potential to put me into danger just by knowing it, then I’d still rather know.”

  
She paused.

  
“After all,” she continued quietly, “it’s putting you in danger and I don’t want you to have to deal with that alone.”

  
Anyway I got teary-eyed when she said that and said I was a bad friend and she said I wasn’t and then I told her about how I’m like 99% certain that the administration not only knows what’s going on, but that they’ve got a hand in controlling the inhuman creatures.  My biggest fear, I said, was that they’d find out what we’re up to and come after us.

  
“Like what, we could get expelled?” she said.

  
“More like expelled from life,” I muttered.

  
“Ohhhh.  Okay yeah I can see why you’re nervous.”

  
She’d broaden her search, she said.  Hit a couple other years for the same timeframe at random.  Make it harder to pinpoint what exactly she was looking for.  That was assuming the administration was monitoring the library at all, it was a big campus with a lot of people and they couldn’t even catch the assholes that sometimes pulled the fire alarm in the middle of the night.  She didn’t have much confidence that they could pull off mass surveillance to ensure no one found out too much about the monsters roaming campus.

  
“They let us run the Rain Chasers, after all,” she said brightly.

  
“I don’t think you were close to finding out anything dangerous.”

  
“Maybe not.  But they also let it reform and this time it’s got a professor’s close guidance.”

  
Yeah.  That’s right.  The Rain Chasers were all set to dissolve and then the sponsor got involved and went to great lengths to ensure that didn’t happen.  If the administration really wanted to keep everything secret, it would have been easy to just quietly inform the folklore professor that she needed to give her club up.

  
“Though they probably just need a group of students to use as human sacrifices in a pinch,” I muttered.  “Like what they did with Patricia.”

  
“Nope, I know how this goes,” she said, standing abruptly.  “Every time you bring up Patricia you then get all mopey and spend the evening doomscrolling the internet to make yourself feel worse.”

  
She grabbed my wrist.

  
“C’mon, we’re going to the library.”

  
Now, I have been to the library a few times since last year.  While a lot of stuff is accessible online, sometimes it’s just easier to go to a section labeled with the topic you need to write a paper on and start pulling out books.  I’ve found that’s a great way to get a lot of citations in a short amount of time.  So I haven’t been avoiding the library.  I also have gone there a few times with Cassie and even once with Maria since the school year started.  Nothing out of the ordinary happened.  
I’ve tried to think back on the timeline of when I last went to the library.  Was it before the graveyard visit?  I can’t remember.  I just know that sometime in between my last visit and the one I am about to describe, something has changed.

  
With me.

  
Maria’s research was uneventful, at least.  She didn’t find anything useful.  Unsurprisingly, the local newspapers' physical copies were deep in storage somewhere and would need a special request to get them out.  Maria seemed about to ask for that, but I was in her peripheral vision signaling no, we shouldn't do anything that leaves a record of any kind, and she reluctantly told the front desk to not bother.  We’d just search the digital archives instead.  Which we could have done from the comfort of my dorm, but whatever, we were here so might as well stay and make use of a distraction free environment.

  
We got a couple computer desks and Maria started searching while I worked on homework.  I think we were there for about an hour before I noticed something strange.

  
Someone was staring at me from across the room.  

  
We were on the second floor, where all the computers were.  The stacks were below us on the first floor.  The layout of this floor was interesting in that they didn’t have enclosed rooms, but rather walls strategically placed to create alcoves that were out of sight from each other.  Each section had a handful of computers, scattered in groups of two throughout the area.  The alcove we’d taken was empty when we arrived.

  
The newcomer stood at the edge of the room, one hand raised to rest on the wall.  I recognized him.  We’d met before.

  
Water dripped from his bent elbow.

  
I elbowed Maria and she glanced up.  She hadn’t gotten a look at the library ghost, on account of the whole almost drowning thing, so I mouthed who he was to her.  Her eyes went big and there was a glint of excitement in them.  I’d hoped she was over that but… I guess she hadn’t changed as much as I thought.

  
“Go talk to it!” she whispered.

  
“No!” I hissed back.

  
“C’mon, you’ve encountered it a couple times already, it has to be here for you.  It’s fine, he’s helpful, right?”

  
Even helpful inhumans can be dangerous.  But she had a point.  He was staring directly at me.  I ground my teeth together and stood.  His eyes remained steady on me as I walked over.

  
“So,” I said, “hi?”

  
Seriously, what do you say to a ghost?  He stared back at me, a mournful expression on his face.  I watched as a droplet of water ran down his forehead, along the bridge of his nose, and finally dripped off onto the carpet.

  
“Thanks for all your help last time,” I said.  “That was scary.  The eyeball is gone, by the way, but maybe you already know that…”

  
I trailed off.  His gaze was unnerving, staring at me like that without speaking.  He’d spoken to me before, so it wasn’t like this silence was required by his nature or anything.  He was choosing not to say anything.  I glanced backwards at Maria to see if she had any helpful suggestions.

  
“I don’t want you here anymore,” he said abruptly.

  
My head snapped back to stare at him.  His expression hadn’t changed.  It didn’t seem to match the anger in his voice.

  
“I didn’t bring the eyeball on purpose, I swear,” I said.

  
But he only shook his head at me.

  
“That’s not it.  I can’t trust you anymore.”

  
Then he grabbed my arm and started dragging me towards the nearest window.  I gasped and dug in my heels, but the library ghost is strong.  I think that’s kind of unfair.  Inhumans are stronger than humans just in general, but of all things I feel like a ghost should be an exception.  Or maybe ghost is the wrong thing to call him.

  
Regardless of what he is, he is tangible, and he was able to drag me across the room as if he were a statue and all my cursing and punching came to nothing.  Maria joined the fray, first grabbing hold of me and then putting herself bodily between the ghost and the window.  He merely shoved her aside.

  
The window.  Why the window?

  
Unless he intended to evict me from the library through it.

  
“I’ll leave!” I cried desperately.  “I swear I will!  I’ll leave and I won’t come back!”

  
Three feet away now.  Two.  His grip twisted around on my arm, as if he were preparing himself to throw something.  I raised my arms to protect my head, breathless, wondering if I landed on something expendable - like an arm or my legs - if I would survive the fall with only a few broken bones.

  
Then the ghost stopped.  He closed his eyes and sighed.  And he vanished.  Just… gone.

  
I stood there dumbly for a moment with my heart pounding.

  
“What… just happened?” I whispered.

  
“We’ll figure it out somewhere else!”  She was already shoving things back into my backpack.  “Let’s get out while we can.”

  
I wasn’t going to argue.  We hastily packed up our belongings and hurried for the stairs.  When we reached the first floor, we found that there was water up to our waists already.  

  
Because of course there was.

  
Maria and I glanced at each other and her expression mirrored my own.  This was bullshit.  Total bullshit.

  
“Yeah, yeah,” I get it,” I mumbled.  “We’re leaving.”

  
I sloshed into the water.  At least this explained why the ghost had abandoned me so abruptly.  He was probably off escorting someone lost in the stacks to safety.  I had no intention to go find them.  I wouldn’t be of any help and if the library ghost no longer liked me, then I’d only make it worse.  The ghost would be enough.  He’d done this plenty of times.

  
The water had receded at the exit and we stepped outside without any trouble.  I was all set to go back to my dorm, but Maria wanted to wait and see if anyone else with wet clothing exited the library.  She wanted to make sure whoever the ghost had gone to fetch made it out okay.

  
At least, that’s what she said.  I think she also wanted to quiz me on why the ghost didn’t want me around anymore and I couldn’t tell her much.  The only theory I have is that it’s because of my friendship with Grayson, but Maria doesn’t know he’s the president’s son and I’m not going to tell her that.

  
The ghost also didn’t like Patricia.  I did tell Maria that, and Maria said we didn’t have much in common that she was aware of.  She was quick to dismiss this theory, possibly because of the whole ‘Ashley gets sad when Patricia is mentioned’ thing.

  
Inside the library, the water steadily continued to rise against the glass doors.  Students came and went, oblivious, and it was an unnerving sight to watch them open the door and step inside a wall of water.  The water had risen to the ceiling by that point and it felt surreal to see people walking about underwater, unaware that anything was wrong.

  
Then someone slammed against the door.  A woman.  She was floating in the water, her long hair spread around her, and she was beating on the glass in an attempt to force the door open.  
This was who the library ghost had gone to save.

  
Except she couldn’t get out.

  
Maria was instantly on her feet and was running for the front of the library.  Her immediate reaction broke me out of my shock and then I was right behind her.  She had hold of the library door handle and was pulling as hard as she could.  I joined her.  

  
I grabbed hold and heaved, putting all my strength into it, but the door wouldn’t budge.  The woman slammed at the glass with both hands, her eyes wide with terror.  I lowered my center of gravity, getting more of my leg strength behind it, but still we could not free the woman trapped inside.

  
We were going to watch her drown, I realized.  I felt the strength leaving my body and despair creeping in.  She was going to drown in front of us and there was nothing I could do to stop it.  
Then another pair of hands - a man’s - joined us.

  
“It’s okay!” he yelled at the woman.  “I’m going to get you out!”

  
He knew her.  You could hear it in his voice.

  
And the door gave.  It slipped open only an inch, but that was all we needed.  The water began to escape in a rush and it felt like a deep, shuddering sigh emanated from the building.  It relinquished its prey.  The woman came tumbling out in a deluge of water.  She sat there on the pavement, gasping for breath, looking around her in amazement that she was here, in the clean air, alive.

  
Then the young man grabbed her elbows.  She stared at him a moment, he shook her a little, and that snapped her back to reality.  Her eyes focused on his face.

  
“I came to meet you here - but - what happened?” he asked, bewildered.  “I-I’ve heard the library flooded but thought it was just-just a story.”

  
“I just - I was - going to check out these books - it swept me back into the library,” she gasped.  “I-I think I lost the books.  I really wanted them too…”

  
He froze for a moment.  Took a deep breath.

  
“How were you going to check those out?  You have a stack of them in your dorm room that are, what, months overdue at this point!”

  
He was yelling in that sort of way that you use when you’re mad over something trivial because you’re too scared to yell about what you’re actually mad about, which is how you almost lost them.  Look, I grew up in a big family, we did some dumb things growing up, I know what that sort of yelling sounds like.

  
Then she admitted that she’d asked him to meet her there so she could check them out under his name and that just made everything so much better.

  
Maria gestured for me to follow her away from the scene unfolding in front of the library.  The rescued student was crying now and her boyfriend was sort-of-apologizing-but-not-really  and it was better if they sorted this out between them without an audience.  Staring at what could potentially turn into a very messy breakup if handled incorrectly was kind of rude.

  
“Overdue books!” Maria hissed.  “She had overdue books!”

  
“So?”

  
Maria huffed, apparently annoyed by my inability to read her mind.

  
“You’re trying to figure out the triggering conditions for all these creatures on campus, right?” she said.  “So what’s the trigger for the flood?”

  
I opened my mouth to say ‘the ghost’ but then immediately closed it.  No, that was wholly incorrect.  They were connected, but the ghost didn’t show up until after the flood arrived and then it was to save whoever was caught in it.

  
“Getting lost?” I ventured.  “We got lost and then it started flooding.”

  
“What if that’s not related though?  What if there are multiple phenomena in the library and they have separate triggers?  We were lost for a while before the flood showed up.”

  
I glanced back at the girl.  What Maria was saying was starting to make sense.  The rescued student had gasped out that she was on her way out of the stacks when the flood pulled her back in.

  
Our conversation paused for a moment as the boyfriend’s voice rose in volume for just a moment as he yelled, “You have to return them at some point!!” at her.  We waited to ensure the shouting was done for the time being and then returned to our own conversation.

  
“So assuming the ghost, the flood, and the maze are all separate occurrences that sometimes happen together,” I said slowly, “we’d need to find triggers for all three.  The ghost is obviously the flood.  He rescues people from the flood.”

  
“The maze is probably wandering around in the stacks without other people nearby,” Maria said.  “That’s what we were doing.”

  
“And then the flood is…”

  
We both glanced back at the girl and then over to the doors of the library, the glass doors catching the light just enough to obscure whatever lay behind them.

  
“It’s the library’s way of defending itself,” Maria said quietly.

  
It came for the girl because she had too many overdue books and no intention of returning them anytime soon.  I doubt it was malice towards the library - my personal theory is she was likely prone to procrastination and then the problem had piled up until it was now a big problem and she was too embarrassed or too overwhelmed to address it directly.

  
I’ve never done anything like that, oh no, not me.

  
But the library had its own set of rules and she’d violated them.

  
“We were talking,” Maria said quietly, “the day it flooded on us.”

  
And I admit that we were being kind of noisy.  Maria was excited.  She’s loud when she’s excited.  
Libraries are quiet places.  You are supposed to be silent inside them.

  
The library also flooded on the day the eyeball followed me there.  Was it because I’d brought the creature with me?  Or because I’d almost dropped one of their only copies of a book?

  
I think… this needs to be a rule.  Something about how the library has its own set of rules and how you can’t break them… or something something bad things happen.  

  
I don’t know, I’m finishing this post up well after midnight here because I make poor life choices so I’ll think about it and update the rules another day.[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
