She pulled me towards the trees, her short legs somehow taking strides an athlete would struggle to keep up with.

“Why are you running so fast? I can barely keep up!” My grip on her hand began to slip. It wasn't until I let go to catch my breath that she stopped and turned around.

“Sorry, I didn't realize how fast I was going. Are you okay?”

“Yeah I’m okay. I see the tree ahead, can we pause there for a second?”

“Okay.” She turned around and kept walking, eventually sitting down and leaning against the tree. I quickly followed suit and sat beside her. Sitting on the cold dirt made me shiver.

“So, what now?” I asked curiously.

“What time is it?”

“About 6:00.”

“Oh I thought it was later than it is. I don't have to be back quite yet if you want to  stay for a minute.” She said, turning her head away from me shyly.

“I can probably stay for a few more minutes.”

She turned back towards me, her hair fell in her face and she blew it out of the way, revealing a smile. Above us I heard something flutter through the branches. My eyes pointed upwards and met the gaze of a Raven. It seemed eerily familiar, its orange eyes burned with curiosity as it tilted its head back and forth, silently observing us.

“I'm sorry if I've been a bit weird. I'm a little surprised I haven't scared you off yet.” Her voice was low and articulated. It gave off the impression she was older than she was. “Like I said, I'm not good with new people.”

“It's okay, I've just been enjoying the company. It's been a long time since I've made a proper friend.”

“I appreciate you and your mom inviting me to dinner. It was very kind. I just-” her voice faltered and she looked at her hands in her lap. “I don't know how long I'll be able to stick around.”

“What do you mean? Are you in trouble?”

“I guess you could say so. I don't know, it doesn't really matter right now.”

The Raven fluttered to a lower branch. It was low enough that it was directly eye level with me. It turned one eye towards me and it shone bright in the moonlight with a deep sense of what seemed to be hatred.

“Do you see that bird over there?”

“What bird?”

“The Raven right in front of me.”

“Oh yeah. I see it.” her voice dropped intensely and her words shook as she noticed the bird.

“Why is it looking at me like that?”

“I don't know.” She turned her head away from it, and covered her face with her hair. “Everett.” She whispered.

“Yeah?”

“I need to go.”

“Okay, I'll walk with you.”

“No. Just go, I’ll be fine.”

“Are you sure?”

“Yes. Just go.”

I stood up and brushed the dirt off my pants. I looked at her in confusion as she rose, her back was pressed to the tree trunk and her head turned away. I started walking, after a few steps I attempted to catch a glance to see where she went. I turned around and she was gone. The only trace left behind was another flower. This time it was a deep blue, the kind of blue that fills you with sadness.

As I was walking, anxiety began to build in my chest. The cold air became increasingly hard to breath and I could feel my legs start to carry me faster against my will. I watched the tree branches, the overwhelming sense of being watched fell over me like a weighted blanket. I kept walking as fast as I could without running. The ground was uneven and I started to stumble over tree roots reaching from the ground like bark clad serpents. As I watched the trees the limbs began to move. It looked as though the branches were closing in on me. The trees bent over in a vain attempt to constrict the path ahead. I could feel my heart pounding against my chest, the sound erupted into my ears and threw me off balance. I felt roots wrap around my ankles only to be torn from the earth with each step. The thorny bark tore at my skin as the roots broke their grasp.

Something in that moment didn't connect in my head. The sudden burst of fear filled my head with a fog, causing all of my thoughts to be filtered away. My only instinct was to keep running, even though I was almost sure that it was all in my head. But that would be proven false when I made it home and the panic faded away.

I burst into the house through the back door, my breath was frantic and my heart was still on overdrive. Once I caught my breath I sat down on the floor to take off my shoes. The house was silent. The lights were all off, the house was consumed in total darkness. I went to reach next to me for my flashlight but I realised I must have dropped it in my escape. My ankles burned as I tore off my shoes and socks, reminding me instantly that what had happened wasn't in my head.

Once my head cleared and my heart slowed, I checked my watch. It read 10:00 pm.

“How in the hell?” I whispered under my breath. I knew wholeheartedly that I was not in those woods for almost four hours. There was just no way. The anxiety began to build again so I decided just to sneak up to bed and lay there. I threw myself on the bed, not even bothering with the blankets and stared up at the ceiling. The image of the trees closing in on me and the Ravens devilish stare were burned into my mind.

That night I dont think I slept even for an hour, but the hour that I did sleep was dreamless and empty. I awoke to the sound of something tapping on my window. It was incessant and annoyed me enough to muster the strength to get up. Groggily I stood from my bed and threw open the curtains. I forgot that next to my window was a tree, and sometimes on particularly stormy nights it would bend just enough to hit my window with one of the branches. From what I could tell at the moment, there was no wind, or rain, and as I listened closer and watched it bend and tap and bend and tap, I started to make out a pattern. It would tap three times, pause and then repeat. It was too deliberate to be accidental. I opened the window and sure enough, there was no breeze at all. I leaned out and right as I went to break the branch I was stopped by her voice. I looked out and was suddenly blinded by a light in the distance, aimed directly at my face.

“Willow?” I called out as quietly as possible. I don't know if she heard me from across the yard but she put the light down revealing her face locked into a look of longing. I pondered whether I should sneak outside or wave her to the window. She stood perfectly not breaking her gaze. I decided I'd do the right thing and go out to her. As I threw proper clothes on and found a coat I realized I had to be to school in exactly 30 minutes. I had to hurry before my mom woke up and realized I was not getting ready.

I met her at the treeline and something didn't feel right at all. She dropped the flashlight which I assumed was mine, and ran towards me, roping me into a hug that was scarily genuine. I was taken aback by the sudden embrace but something told me that she needed it, so I didn’t retaliate and hugged her back. As she rested her head on my shoulder I felt a tear fall from her face and onto my neck.

“What's goin on?”

She pulled away and I immediately noticed the deep red bruises surrounding her neck. This sent a chill down my spine and made my stomach drop.

“I'm sorry it's early, but can I go to school with you today?”

“Uh, yeah I guess, won't you get in trouble though?” I avoided bringing up her bruises so I didn't make her too uncomfortable. I knew all too well how frustrating it could be to be bombarded with questions in times like this.

“Please Everett? I don't care what happens later. But I can't put you in danger.”

“What do you mean by putting me in danger?”

“She won't hurt you if you're with me.” her voice turned cold and serious. I did nothing to respond besides nod my head.

“I'll meet you in the side yard. You can go over there until it's time to leave. I have to be back inside before my moms up.”

“Okay.”

I walked her to the side yard and unlocked the gate to save time later. She sat on the radiator for the house and kicked her feet anxiously. I ran back inside and went to my room. Right as I finished getting ready my Mom got up and came in to check on me.

“Oh you're up already, I was worried because you got 10 minutes to get there.”

“I know, I'm ready. No need to worry.” I ran down the stairs and to the front door before she could respond. She followed me and stood at the last step to say goodbye.

“Be safe and have a good day okay. Dinner will be cooking when you get home.”

“Thanks mom, Love you.”

“Love you too son.”

I slammed the door behind me and sprinted to the side yard. I threw open the gate and to my surprise Willow wasn't there.

“Over here stupid.” she called from the street corner.

I scoffed under my breath and ran to catch up. I swear I ran more catching up to her than any gym class I'd been in. We made the journey to the school and got to my first class.  I was hoping that nobody would notice Willow, especially the teachers, but that hope was quickly dashed away, as we walked into the room. Mr. Henderson, the language arts teacher, Immediately turned his attention towards us.

“Morning Everett, who might this be?”

“Uhm…” I had to pause and think of an answer. I had never been good with confrontation.

“I'm Willow. I'm just visiting.”

“Well Willow, we don't usually have new students show up out of the blue, but as long as you don't interrupt I'm sure you're perfectly fine to stay for the day. I will inform your other teachers as well.”

“Thank you Mr. Henderson. We won't be a problem I promise.”

Class went by without issue. Pretty much everyone slept through the entire lecture, while me and Willow whispered to each other in the back of the room. I showed her the basics of essay writing and in return she taught me how to read Shakespeare properly. Apparently she had read most of his stories from a book she had.

I never got her full story throughout the time I knew her. She would often show incredible amounts of knowledge about very specific things, like Shakespeare and nature. She knew how to tell different kinds of plants apart from just the shade of green they were, and she could tell me details about Romeo and Juliet not even the teacher knew. There were also the moments where her voice dropped and her expressions changed to make her appear much older than she actually was. It frightened me sometimes, and when she met me that morning there was something in her voice that filled me with dread.

The next few classes went by with ease, and it wasn't until the period before lunch that we ran into trouble. My math class was always my least favorite, partially because of the subject but for the most part it was because of Derek and his group of miscreants. I knew the moment we walked into class that they were going to cause issues. As Willow and I found our seats, Derek had already started a spitball war between his friends, our other classmates eventually got caught in the crossfire. Luckily we managed to avoid the rogue projectiles. The bullies usually stayed out of my way, unless they needed the answer to a math question, which was a request no one dared to refuse. For some reason the school never did anything about them. They managed to make it up to eighth grade without visiting the principal once. I'd been shoved into lockers, spit on, tripped, they expertly wove slurs and swears into a tapestry of hatred, and still no one had bothered to punish them. So naturally I was worried when I; statistically their second most notorious victim, showed up with a strange girl that no one had ever seen before. It was especially worrying because Willow being who she was, would have immediately been targeted for her shy demeanor and less than flattering attire.

Most of the class flew by, the clock hands raced double time to make it to the end of the hour. I taught Willow some of the basics of the algebra we were learning. Math was a pretty foreign topic to her. She seemed to only have a basic understanding of addition and subtraction. Whatever her mother taught her it was incredibly curated. It was strange. As the bell rang for lunch, I wanted to be the first one to the cafeteria to beat the crowd, so I grabbed Willow by the hand and made it for the door. It was just my luck that on our way out, Derek and his group attempted to shove through the small doorway at the same time. His shoulder slammed into mine and I fell back into the door frame. The collision caused his backpack to slide off his back and hit the ground, and from it came the horrible sound of ceramic shattering.

“Yo, what the hell man!” He turned to me and pulled me from the doorway, lifting me up by my collar; for an 8th grade kid his stature was impressive. Willow stood silent in the hallway.

“I didn't mean to, I swear.”

“Do you know how long I worked on that project?”

“Probably a long time. Please just let me go man.”

“Watch where you're going next time Graham. You and your girlfriend.”

“She not my-” He let go of my collar, my feet hit the ground and slipped out from under me. The rest of his gang shoved past and each one gave me their own unique glare of malice.

“Are you okay?” Willow said as she offered to help me up.

“Yeah I'm fine. Let's go to lunch. Follow me.”

I led her through the halls to the cafeteria. The entire room was full, and the spot that I usually took was occupied by Derek's gang. We got our glorified prison food and sat down as close as we could to the exit. As we ate in silence, I noticed Willow continuously glancing at Derek, she didn't even bother to make it discreet. I could tell something was going on in her head and It wasn't good.

“Stop looking at them.”

“Why?” her voice was deep and commanding.

“They’re not worth the trouble. They’ll go after you next if they notice you staring at them.”

“I'm a girl. They won't hit a girl.”

“I'm not so sure about that one. Their violence doesn't discriminate.”

“Fine.” she turned around and threw her arms across her chest, folding them tightly.

“You don't have to protect me Willow.”

“Yes I do.”

“Not from them at least. But I don't know what you're so worried about happening to me.”

“What happened last night?”

“It was nothing. I just got scared.”

“No, It wasn't nothing. I got you hurt.”

“How was that your fault? If anything I should be the one saying that.” I aimed my eyes at the marks around her neck.

“That doesn't matter. What will happen to you is a lot worse now that-”

“What do you mean?” Her eyes began to tear up and her voice shook.

“She knows who you are. She made me tell her. She’s been watching you.”

“Who?”

“I think you know who.”

“I've never even met your mother, how could she be watching me?”

“You wouldn't believe me. All I can say is that as long as I take the fall, she won't hurt you. That's why I was so anxious to be here today.”

“I’ll be fine Willow.” I didn’t know what else to say. What she was saying made sense but something was off, there were too many questions.

“I know there's something different about you. I've seen the flowers you leave behind. I know your singing was the reason I found you, more like lured to you. But you're going to have to tell me a little bit more for this to make any sense.”

“Last night, she tried to kill you.”

“Your mother made the trees try to kill me?”

“Yes Everett. Put the pieces together.”

“Sorry, I was just clarifying.”

“It's fine. I'm sorry.”

“Don't be. I am curious though. What is it about that tree? I've avoided the question but now seems like the time to ask.”

“I uh, Its- its where I-”

Once lunch was over kids stood from their seats and ran out the doors at the end of the cafeteria in a cacophony of laughter and unfinished conversations. We waited for the crowd to disperse before heading outside for the last few minutes before the bell rang. I took Willow out to the field, and past the soccer fields. In the back corner there was a tree that twisted over the fence, its withered form provided just enough cover from the light rain that had just begun. I leaned against the fence and Willow sat down next to me, she ran her hands through the cold wet grass and pulled individual blades from the dirt.

“I'm sorry if I asked that question at a bad time.”

“It's fine. I wasn't going to answer anyway.” As she pulled blades of grass from the earth, small flowers began to sprout around her. They weren't purple or yellow, but a deep shade of blue. This was the first time that I put together what they meant.

“The flowers, they mean something don't they?”

“Uh, yeah I guess.”

“What do they mean?”

She looked up at me, a small tear rolled down her cheek.

“What do you think?”

“What's wrong, you can be honest with me. Tell me the truth.”

“The truth is, I said I'm protecting you,  and I mean, I am but it's more because I don't think I can leave you. But, I have too.”

“If you knew this was going to happen, why did you agree to this in the first place? You said your mother tried to kill me, and it's obvious she hurts you everytime I see you. I'd rather you not stay with me if it's going to hurt me, and more importantly not if it's going to hurt you.”

“Because I need a friend Everett!”

More flowers bloomed, their petals as blue as the deep sea, and her tears blended with the rain, making them flow like rivers down her cheeks. She looked down at the ground, her hands were buried firmly in the soil, and more flowers sprouted from beneath her fingers.

“My mother doesn't think I deserve you. She says you will hurt me, just as my father hurt her. She says I don't belong anywhere but with her, and she's the only one who can protect me.”

“I don't know what to say.” I slid down to her level, the tree limbs that peered through the chain link fence tore at my back as I sat.

“You don't have to say anything.” her voice was solemn and distant. “I'm sorry. You've only known me for a few days. You’re just the only person I've met that doesn't look at me like I'm just some creature from the woods.”

“Forgive me for asking, but what exactly are you?”

“I'm a person. Just like you, like your mom, like these kids. I'm just different, in ways that I can't really explain.”

“I'm sorry I didn't mean for that to come off that way.”

“Don't be. I know what I am.”

“Willow, you are a person. I don't see you as anything else. I just want to understand how exactly you're different, besides these.” I plucked a flower from the ground and gently put it in her hair.

“I don't know how to explain it. I have so many memories but none of them feel like they’re my own. I connect with nature, it listens to me. The trees, birds and even the grass, they speak to me, and I speak to them.”

“Is that why you sing?”

“Mhm.”

“So what is it about the tree?”

“I've somehow fooled you this long. I thought you'd catch on. The tree is my home Everett. It's that big for a reason.”

“You mean? You live inside it?”

“Yeah, me and my mother.”

“That's how you-” I was cut off by a rogue soccer ball flying towards me with the speed of a bullet. My attention shot to the kids approaching us as the ball collided with my nose and I heard a sickening crunch. Willow promptly wiped her tears and stood, her fists were balled, her knuckles white. The kids covered their faces with their arms to block the rain as they marched towards us like soldiers on a mission. I didn’t need to see their faces, I already knew who they were.

“Shit.” I muttered.

“Yo, Graham! That’s for busting my project!” Derek snapped. Rage boiled in his eyes.

“Sorry.” I said as I rolled the ball from my lap to his feet. My nose was on fire, and blood started to run down my face. He stepped towards me and kicked the ball over the fence. His friends looked at each other in disappointment.

“You should be sorry. That was for my final! Now I’m gonna fail the class because of you.”

“Surely your teacher would understand that it was an accident.” Willow said sternly, her voice laced with resentment.

“Who are you to say? You don’t even go to school. Stay out of it.”

“Hey! Don’t talk to her like that!” I yelled.

I stood up and balled my fists, and Willow stood behind me in an identical stance.

“I’m sorry I got in your way. If you fail your class because of me, I take the blame. But keep her out of this.”

Derek stepped closer to me, his arm raised and his fist clenched ready to strike.

“Don't do this Derek.”

“Taking the blame isn't enough.” In the blink of an eye his fist collided with my already injured nose. I heard it crack again, this time I was sure it was broken. I fell back and Willow tried to catch me on the way down. I brushed her off and stood back up, ready to defend myself. Derek took another swing, and I managed to evade just in time. The momentum carried him forwards and his stocky body landed against the fence. I looked back to make sure nobody was watching but to my surprise the entire field was now empty. The bell had already rung. I snapped my attention back to Derek as he let out a deafening yell.

“What are you? Some kind of witch!?” My eyes met his as a snaking branch descended from the tree above and began to wrap around his neck. I looked at Willow in shock, my body frozen from the sudden intensity of the situation. Her eyes were distant and cold. She stood motionless and I could see a sinister darkness enveloping her body. I still can't decide if she was just trying to scare Derek or if her true intention was something far darker.

“Don't call me a Witch!” she screamed as the branch began to wrap tighter against the poor kid's neck. I screamed for her to stop as the image of him struggling for air and grasping at the wooden noose etched a permanent place in my mind.

“Willow no!”

Her attention turned to me and her eyes filled with fear. Her legs began to shake and suddenly Derek fell to the ground with a nauseating thud. We just stood there in silence looking at each other in mutual albeit different forms of horror. Willow's tears resumed their journey down her face as the darkness faded from her eyes. Derek groaned in pain as he grasped at his neck.

“I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.” Willow said, her voice filled with regret. No words came to my head, my throat felt as dry as the sand of the Sahara. With words out of the picture, I took her hands and pulled her in for a hug.

“I'm sorry.” she pulled away and looked at me, the rain stopped and the sun shone through the clouds. It illuminated her face and her tears glistened in the light. I looked over to see Derek had disappeared.

“What now?” I said quietly.

“I want to go home.”

“Want me to walk with you?”

“No.”

“Okay. Be safe.”

“I'll be fine.” She looked to the tree above us and closed her eyes. The tree boomed and croaked as it bent over the fence and scooped her off her feet.

I watched her as she was hoisted into the air and disappeared behind the fence. I collapsed to the ground as anxiety filled in my chest. I had just missed an entire class, and almost got a kid killed. I feared what would happen next, but to my surprise, I was never called back inside, nobody came to get me in trouble, and when I made it home, relief washed over me when I smelt the dinner in the oven.
