I’ve come to really hate this time of year. Maybe my grief over Alex would be more dormant if I had even a speck of closure or understanding about what transpired in October 2015. But I simply don’t. I loved him, and coping with his absence would be hard enough if it was as straightforward as a failed marriage, a terminal illness, or a tragic accident. Even if he had been murdered, as horrific as that would have been, murder would have at least had some associated motive and finality to it. At least I’d be certain he was dead.

As I write this, I desperately hope that he is dead. Honestly though, I believe he’s still alive somewhere. When the reality of that concept takes hold, it fills me with an intense, unyielding dread. And everyone around me, my coworkers, neighbors, and even my family don’t remember what actually happened and their part in it. I would give anything to be like them, to have the hollow comfort of false memories. But, for some god-forsaken reason, I am somehow immune to the broadcast. 

I’m posting this because I hope to find at least one other person who has to live with the truth like me.

It started on the first Saturday of October. Night had covered the Chicago suburbs, and we relaxed on the couch with some cheap whiskey and cable television. I honestly can’t remember what we watched, but I have an oddly vivid memory of the moments before the broadcast.

I had set my glass down on the table to look over at Alex, and I found myself in the blissful stasis that comes with truly loving someone. We knew each other from childhood. Alex proved a kind soul, a hard worker, and a best friend. He had a sturdy head on his shoulders as well. His logical and even-tempered nature provided a great counterbalance to my skittishness.

My emotional stargazing ended abruptly due to the blaring emergency broadcast that started coming from our television.

Looking back at our TV screen, I was immediately perplexed by what I saw. The siren continued its sound, but it lacked the usual emergency display with its colored bars. Instead, the noise was playing over what appeared to be the set of a “live studio audience” type sitcom.

The feed appeared hazy, indistinct and dusty as if recorded in the 70s or 80s. Two staircases, one on each side of the frame, climbed a few steps before turning to meet at a central balcony occupying the top third of the room. Below the balcony appeared a family living space, with a stiff-appearing burgundy couch and loveseat in the center. A Persian rug, bright blue and gold, lay under the sofa. The color mismatch of burgundy, blue and gold was immediately off putting. In fact, the entire set was slightly off. Multiple framed family photos hung on the walls, yet the pictures were positioned too low, almost knee level instead of eye level. Seeing the fine details proved challenging because of the poor connection, but every photograph seemed to feature a different family, each striking the same pose—arms embracing, set against a cloudy blue backdrop, like something out of a Sears catalog. A lamp without a lampshade sat on the table next to the couch; its bulb was oversized and bigger than the actual chasis of the lamp. An entire taxidermy deer occupied a space in the back of the room behind the couch, head facing toward the wall instead of forward and into the room.

Uncanny is the word for it all, I guess. Before I was able to question Alex about what he thought was happening, a solitary figure appeared on screen from stage left.

We first saw a black pant leg with a matching black tuxedo shoe enter the frame, but it did not immediately make contact with the wooden tiling of the set. Instead, right before hitting the floor, it stopped its motion and remained suspended off the floor for at least thirty seconds, as if the whole thing had transitioned to being a still photograph instead of a video. Abruptly, the heel of the shoe finally made contact with the ground, causing the emergency siren to stop instantly. Nothing replaced the deafening noise, not even the familiar sound of dress shoes tapping against a hard surface. The figure rapidly paced to the area in front of the couch and turned to face the camera. In addition to his shoes not sounding against the wood tile, at times, his feet seemed to slightly phase in and out of the floor.

He wore a deep navy peacoat buttoned up to the top button with half of a white bow tie peeking out from the collar. In his hand, he held the same type of microphone used by Bob Barker during his tenure on The Price is Right - I think it’s called a “gooseneck”. It was long and slender, with a tiny microphone head on top to speak into. A power cord connected to the microphone dragged behind him, eventually tapering off to reveal that the damn thing wasn’t even plugged in.

I don’t recall too many details about his face (intentionally, it has helped me cope), but I can’t forget his eyes and eye sockets. They were cavernous, triple the diameter and depth of an average person. The sockets extended well into his forehead, almost meeting his hairline, down into his cheekbones, with the perimeters connecting at the bridge of his nose. His actual eyes looked *almost* normal - proportioned correctly and moving as you’d expect. That being said, they appeared to be made of glass, the stage lights intermittently refracting off one or both, depending on his positioning. 

After some excruciating silence, he introduced himself as “Mr. Eugene Tantamount” and began to spin his brief monologue. I will attempt to transcribe the speech as I remember it below, but I can’t say it is one hundred percent accurate for two reasons. One, those few minutes of my life happened upwards of ten years ago. On top of that, the speech was incoherent and nearly unintelligible, to me at least. Mr. Tantamount spoke with a very awkward and clunky phrasing and took seemingly random pauses, all while interspersing a variety of nonsense words into the mix. 

Here’s the best summary I can come up with from what I remember. In terms of the nonsense words, I am mostly guessing in the spelling. I would hear them a lot in the days following the broadcast, but never saw them written down:

*“Hello, guests. My, what day we’re having. It reminds me of before.* 

(pauses for about 15 seconds or so. As another note, I do not recall him even speaking into the microphone. He just kind of held it off to his side.)

*“But on to matters: what of the next steps? Who will have the win to become* Klavensteng? *Ah yes! The grand great. As much as everyone wants to become* Klavensteng, *not all can, and I am part of all. As you can plainly see, I am very* trivid. 

(pauses, points his right index finger at one cavernous eye socket, after which he points at the other, looking around as he does so)

*However, one of the population is not* trivid. *Or, they have the courage to expel* trividness. *To become* Klavensteng, *the hero must become a fulfilled. They must show utmost* gristif. *A hero rejects* trivid *and becomes* gristif, *which you can plainly look that I am not.*

(pauses again, identically points his right index finger at eye sockets like he did before)

*Alas! Only time will speak. But soon - as our nowtime* Klavensteng *grows withered. Show your* gristif *and become above! To honor dying hero, say today is now over to the past and begin all future !* 

(Bows, screen goes black)

Initially, I experienced shell-shock. I looked over at Alex to try to begin unpacking what the actual fuck just happened when another image flashed on screen, accompanied by what sounded like an amphitheater full of people clapping, somehow louder than the emergency siren. 

An elderly man in his 60s or 70s was pictured sitting on a throne made of slick, black material. Nothing else was easily visible in the frame; the background was obscured by the angle of the camera and the darkness that lurked behind him. The fuzzy quality that made the last segment feel like a sitcom had dissipated.

He wore green and brown army camo, with the sleeves and his pant legs rolled up to their halfway point to reveal his forearms and calves. Initially, it looked like his arms and legs were gently resting against the material. However, upon further inspection, it became clear that all the skin that made contact with the chair was fused with the throne itself. It’s hard to explain, but imagine how the cheese on a burger patty looks when it is cooking. Specifically, when the edges of it extend beyond the meat and onto the grill itself - how the cheese ends up bubbling and cauterized against the hot metal. That’s how the skin that contacted the throne looked.

Above his collar, his eyes remained open, held by the same black material, which fish-hooked under his upper lids and tethered them to something out of the frame, keeping his eyes open and unblinking. The material appeared to fill the space around his eyeballs, slowly leaking down the corners of his eyes. He only looked forward into the camera. I am unsure if he could move his eyes elsewhere.

His mouth stayed closed; however, the material trickled down the edges of his lips, just as it did from the sides of his eyes. I thought he was dead until I saw the synchrony of his chest rising with the subsequent flaring of his nostrils. It was slow, but he looked like he was breathing. Before I was able to discern more, the feed unceremoniously returned to normal. 

I turned to Alex and reflexively asked, “*Jesus, what was that*?”

Guerilla marketing for a new movie was the only explanation I could think of at the time. 

Alex held his hands over his mouth, sitting forward, letting his elbows rest on his knees. I assumed that the broadcast had really startled him, and I put my hand on his shoulder, trying to console him. Then, he said something like this:

*“Can you imagine?”*

*“Can I imagine what, love?”* I replied. 

*“Can you imagine getting the chance to be* Klavensteng?” He said, eyes welling up with tears. 

A little taken aback, I figured he cracked a joke to deal with whatever avant garde bullshit we’d unwillingly endured. I forced a chuckle, trying to play along with the bit, but he turned and glared at me with instantaneous rage. Jarred by the suddenness of his anger, I found myself too bewildered to calibrate a different response, and he silently excused himself to the bedroom and went to sleep for the night. I followed him in a few minutes after that, taking a moment to compose myself, but he did not want to talk about it anymore when I met him in bed. 

As far as I can recall, the following few days remained relatively normal. Slowly, however, Alex began to exhibit strange behavior. First, I found him rummaging through my sewing supplies, observing the geometry of my sewing needles from every angle, holding them by the head while swiveling his head around them. When I asked him what he was doing, he said something along the lines of:

“*Could I borrow some of these?”*

I asked why the hell he would need to borrow some of my sewing needles. He again got frustrated with me, dropped everything, and left the room.

One night, I woke up to find him out of bed at 3 AM or so. Concerned, I got up to look around. He wasn’t in our bathroom, the kitchen, or the living room. Eventually, I started calling out for him. I was about to call 9-1-1- when I located him in our guest bathroom with the light off, which nearly gave me a heart attack. Alex was stretching both of his lower eyelids and staring into the mirror. I gave him shit for not responding to me while I was calling his name. When my anger softened to concern, I asked him to explain his actions. I think he responded:

*“Just checking how* trivid *I am,”*

The following morning, he did not go to work. When I asked him if he felt unwell and took a sick day, he told me he quit his job. He let this abrupt and significant life decision slide out of him while sitting at the kitchen table, sequentially lifting each of his fingernails of one hand with the other and inspecting the space under them by putting them right up to his face. I stood there in stunned silence, and eventually, he said to me, or maybe just to himself:

*“I’m really pretty* gristif, *I think,”*

Alex clearly suffered a mental breakdown following what we had seen on TV a few nights before. I sat down next to him and put my right hand over his, noticing a firm, thin, and movable lump between the tendons of his second and third fingers. When I saw the pin-sized entry wound closer to his wrist, I realized he had inserted one of my sewing needles under the skin of his hand. 

He saw my abject horror, and his response was:

*“Slightly less* trivid *now. More work to be done, though.”*

I phoned my mother, explaining the whole situation in a likely confusing jumble of words and gasps. When I was done, my mom paused for a few moments and then replied:

*“Well, honey, I wouldn’t be too worried. I think he is going to be able to get more* gristif. *What an honor it would be for both you and Alex. If he were selected to be* Klavensteng, *I mean. Let him know he can come over and borrow more sewing needles if he thinks he needs to.”*

Speech failed me. At some point, my mother hung up. I guess she supposed we got disconnected when, in reality, I was just catatonic.

Everyone I talked to in the days following the broadcast spoke exactly the same as Alex and my mother. They all knew the lingo and, moreover, acted like I knew what the fuck they were talking about.

We started getting cold calls to our home phone from numbers I did not recognize. They would ask if they could speak to Alex. Or they’d ask how it was going, how “trivid” he still was and how “gristif” I thought he could be. Eventually, these numbers were from area codes from states outside Illinois. Then, it was international calls. If Alex got to the phone before me, he would just sit and listen to whoever was on the other end of the line with a big grin on his face. At a certain point I disconnected our home line, but that just meant all these calls started to come to our cellphones. 

If I asked, he was unable to or unwilling to explain the meaning of any of this. In fact, he looked dumbfounded when I asked. Like the questions were so frustratingly basic that he could not even dignify them with a response. All the while the memories of Mr. Eugene Tantamount, the man in camo, and the black plastic substance haunted me.

No research I did on any of it was ever fruitful - and to me, that meant Alex was going insane. And no matter how much I begged and pleaded; Alex refused to see a physician. 

At work, people would pat me on the back or go out of their way to do something nice for me. Initially, I assumed they had somehow heard that Alex’s grasp on reality was weakening and they were trying to offer me support. This notion shattered when my boss presented me with a hallmark card, signed by every member of my office, all 40 or so of them. Inside, it said:

*“Thank you for supporting Alex and congratulations on being the spouse to the next grand great! Alex will make a wondrous* Klavensteng”

Sometimes, I wish I had just given up. Gone far away and with no plan of returning, all with the recognition that this event was beyond my understanding or control. If I had done that, I would have had a different last memory of Alex. But I loved him, and I couldn’t abandon him, and now I am cursed with the memories of those final few minutes. 

When I returned home from work three weeks after this all had started, I discovered Alex sitting at our grand piano in the living room. Music was his creative outlet for as long as I had known him, and I felt a brief pitter-patter of hope rise in my chest seeing him sitting on the piano bench, back turned towards me. That hope vanished with the noise of a wire being cut with scissors.

I slowly paced towards him, trying to brace myself for whatever was happening. When I got to Alex’s shoulder and saw that he was delicately feeding piano wire through the space between his left eyelid and eyeball towards the back of his eye socket, I felt my knees give out, and I fell backward. The noise drew his attention towards me, and he pivoted his body and smiled proudly in my direction, small spurts of blood running down his face onto his t-shirt. His right eyeball buldged from its socket, with a few centimeters of piano wire sprouting out from the cavity at the six o’clock position. 

*“I think I’m finally* gristif\*”\*

I rushed to call the paramedics, locking myself in our bedroom for the time being. They assured me that they understood and would be there ASAP. Sobbing, I prayed that the ambulance would be here soon, before Alex lost his vision, or worse. It couldn’t have been more than a minute before I heard multiple knocks at the door.

The knocks continued and intensified as I ran past Alex to what I thought were the medics. No words being spoken by whoever was on the other side. As I opened the door, twenty or so people spilled inside our home. Some of them I recognized - next-door neighbors, a UPS man I was friendly with - but most of them were strangers. They were all smiling and clapping and laughing as they surrounded Alex. They lifted him onto their shoulders and moved him out the door. I yelled at them to put him down. At least I think I did. Honestly, it was all so much in so little time that I may have just let out some feral screams rather than saying anything coherent. 

When I followed them outside, I saw nothing but people stretching in every direction. I legitimately could not determine where the crowd ended - to this day, I have no idea how many people were in that mob, but I want to say it bordered on thousands. Nearly every inch of asphalt, grass and sidewalk in our cul-de-sac had someone on it. None of them were outside when I got home from work, which couldn’t have been more than ten minutes prior. They each had the exact same disposition and jubilation as Alex’s kidnappers, their ecstasy only growing more feverish when they saw Alex arrive on the shoulders of the people who had stolen him from our home. I tried to keep up with him and his captors, but I couldn’t fight through the human density. I watched Alex slowly disappear over the horizon amongst a veritable sea of elated strangers. Hours later, the last of the crowd also vanished over the horizon. 

I have not seen Alex since October 26th, 2015. Upon contacting the police, I anticipated the detective would act as others had for the preceding month, but he was unfamiliar with “trivid”. Nor the word “gristif”. He did not know what it was to be a “klavensteng”. Instead, in a real twist of the psychological knife, he turned it all back on to me:

*“How about instead of wasting my time, you tell me what a* klavensteng *is. Or what it means to be* gristif.*”*

And of course, I did not know. I still do not know. 

My mom didn’t recognize the words anymore. My coworkers did not recognize the words anymore. And it’s not like Alex was erased from reality or anything; I still have all of our pictures and all of his belongings. But when I try to speak to anyone about him and what happened, they cut me off and say something like:

*“So sad about the boating accident. I bet he’s happier wherever he is now, though.”*

What truly tests my sanity is the fact that the explanation for his disappearance changes every time I talk to someone about it. It’s like they know he’s “gone”, but when they are pressed on the details behind that fact, their mind is just set to say whatever random thing pops into their head. Too bad about the esophageal cancer. That house fire was so tragic. Can’t believe he got hit by that drunk driver. The only detail that doesn’t change is that everyone is very confident that he is “happier wherever he is now, though”.

I’m not so confident about his happiness or his well-being. In fact, I’m downright terrified that wherever he is, he is starting to look like the man in the army camo - being slowly subsumed by whatever that slick, black plastic-like material is. And I would give anything to be like everyone else and just forget. I would give anything to experience, even a small fraction of that serenity. But I can’t forget.

I’m assuming this has been going on for a while, and that the cycle will restart once they are done with Alex. With that in mind, I don’t watch any movies or television because I’m afraid someday I’ll be in front of a screen, and I’ll hear that emergency broadcast siren, and it’ll start over again, and he’ll be the one on the throne. I had to take a few Xanax to be in front of a screen long enough to type up this post, which may affect the coherency of it all, and I apologize for that.

Now that most of you think I am clinically insane, back to the point of this post: Is anyone else immune, like me?
