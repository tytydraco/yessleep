History 160 - Aztec History.

Room 315, 3rd Floor of the Harrison Building. 6:30 PM - 8:00 PM

When I first signed up for this class, I was excited beyond belief. In my small community college, you were required to take a history course. I have always been a big history buff, and when I saw this class on the Course Catalog, I knew I was going to take it. The first day of class only made me more excited, as well as my professor.

That day was rainy. Dark clouds loomed over the campus, threatening to spill over any moment. I was thankful I only had morning classes and prayed the rain would subside before 6:30; the forecast called for heavy thunderstorms that afternoon. Walking from my dorm to the Harrison building, I climbed up three flights of stairs to the top floor. Room 315 was at the end of the hallway, but as I exited the stairwell, I could smell the candles. A strong, smokey scent traveled down the hallway and for a brief moment, I thought something had caught fire. It wouldn't have shocked me; the Harrison building was old and falling apart. When I stepped into the classroom, the scent hit me in the face. A few other students sat in the classroom and a tall, lanky man was at a desk in the front of the room.

"Welcome! Your name is?" He questioned. His voice was deep and hoarse, the voice of a long-time smoker.

"Jermey Mitchell," I answered. I watched as he scanned a sheet, then made a checkmark next to what I assumed was my name.

"Nice to meet you Jermey, please sit anywhere," he shot me a friendly smile. A small shiver ran down my spine, something screamed at me that it was wrong. But I was too excited for the class to think about it. I sat on the third row, closer to the wall, and got my laptop out. Looking around the room, there were only ten other people in the room.

"Small class..." I thought to myself, waiting for my laptop to boot up. A few minutes later, the professor got up and shut the door, trapping the ten students inside.

"Welcome to History 160! I'm Professor Manney," he began, pulling up a slideshow on the screen, "today we're going to go over the syllabus and all that," it was difficult to tell if he was happy to be here. I noticed a few interesting things about the syllabus; a requirement of buying candles and Aztec Death Whistle, an extra credit opportunity if you donated blood to the Red Cross, and the final exam was a camping trip. What the fuck?

"Alright, so as I'm sure you all are reading, this class is structured differently from your other classes. For starters, the candles and Aztec Death whistle are a requirement," he explained.

"At the end of the semester, we take a camping trip. I'll explain more as we get to that point in the semester, but it's all funded by the university, so you won't need to buy anything," I breathed a sigh of relief. As strange as it was, at least I wouldn't have to buy a ton of camping gear. The donating blood was odd, and he never explained it. Now and then I would donate plasma for money, so it was similar; donate blood for some extra credit.

The next few weeks were normal. He taught as any normal professor, with a few small red flags that I didn't think much about. Two students had dropped the class, so there were a total of eight of us. I only spoke to three of them: Clara, Sidney, and Matt.

Clara was an education major and involved in our school's women's soccer. She felt weird, a very stereotypical sporty girl, if that makes sense. If she wasn't studying or practicing, then she was at the gym or with her girlfriend. Sidney was in general studies, she didn't know what she wanted to major in just yet. But she was in a sorority, so she spent most of her time partying. She showed up to class hungover most days and would text me later asking for the notes. Matt was a forensics major, and he was fucking weird. He had this fascination, no, *obsession* with death. From what I knew, he didn't get out much other than work and class, which wasn't much. He worked at a morgue as an assistant, so he was constantly surrounded by dead people. Although these three were a little odd, we seemed to get along well enough. 

The only thing we had in common was that our professor had contacted us over spring break.

I stayed on campus for spring break, working a few extra shifts at the local Starbucks. But, on Thursday, I got a notification from my email.


"Dear Jeremy,

I hope your spring break is going well. I just wanted to inform you that the Red Cross blood donation will be on campus this Friday. I would suggest you go in order to gain extra credit.

I wish you the best,

Professor Manney."


I had never mentioned to him that I was staying on campus for spring break. Did he see me around or at work? I brushed it off as that, figuring I was thinking too much into it. But, when I returned back to class, Sidney had asked me if I had gotten the email.

"Jermey, did Mr. Manney send you an email over spring break?" she asked, a tint of worry lacing her voice.

"Yeah?" I shot her a questioning glance.

"About Red Cross? The blood donation extra credit?" Her voice was shaky. Oddly enough, she wasn't hungover.

"Yeah? How'd you know?"

Because he sent me the same email. I don't know how, but he knew I was staying on campus for spring break," she sounded scared.

"Yeah, same. I just figured he had seen me around or something though, don't think about it too much," I tried to rationalize. Later, when Clara had arrived, we had the same discussion. She had also stayed on campus for spring break and gotten the same email. I wanted to ignore it, I wanted to believe that Professor Manney had just seen us around campus, but something about it rubbed me the wrong way.

I stopped trying to rationalize when I heard that Matt had not only gotten the same email, but had also disappeared. 

Clara had spoken to Matt over spring break, informing me and Sidney that he had also gotten the strange email. But then he went radio silent. He stopped showing up to class and stopped responding to texts. Two days later, we finally heard that he just vanished. I tried not to think about it, I tried to rationalize that it was just a coincidence. Deep down, I knew it wasn't, but I guess I wanted to believe that it was. Ever since then, the class has become increasingly strange. We've started talking about Aztec Mythology and that's when everything started going downhill.

Professor Manney had started this unit normally, giving an overview of gods and mentioning a few stories that we would need to know. Then, we started talking about Mictlantecuhtli. For those that don't know, Mictlantecuhtli is like the Hades of Aztec Mythology - he rules over the underworld and is the god of death. I didn't miss the way that when my professor first mentioned him, his eyes glossed over. I didn't miss how he seemed to ramble about this god for longer than the others. It was odd that the next time we had class, the entire lecture was about Mictlantecuhtli. The way Manney spoke about Mictlantecuhtli was the same way that Matt spoke about death, filled with infatuation and obsession.

Ever since, the class has taken a dramatic shift. Any time Manney gets the opportunity to mention this god of death, he does. I'm trying to do some more research on this god, trying to learn just why my professor likes him so much. I'm also trying to stay updated on Matt, trying to figure out what happened. More and more red flags keep popping up in the class, but none of the other students seem to notice what's going on. Either they aren't bothered or don't show it. It's kind of creepy, but I try not to think much about it, I have bigger things to worry about. 

The camping trip is right around the corner and I can't help but feel nervous. It feels like a massive thunderstorm, threatening to create widespread havoc on the town it hits. I have a pit in my stomach, something is so wrong. I've never believed inr 6th sense bullshit, but what I do believe is that something is about eat me alive.
