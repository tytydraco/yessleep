The hospital was mostly empty. Quiet. Dark. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, and the walls were a sickly shade of seafoam green. The doctor, a tall, thin man in his 60s, didn’t seem to believe my story, but he admitted me for observation anyway. My mom was staying at her friend’s house with Grace—in their non-walkout basement.

I didn’t want to leave her. I wanted her right here, with me. But the hospital was above ground. And someone needed to treat my wound before I bled to death.

Luke left me for a moment to use the bathroom. I closed my eyes, not intending to sleep; but I was so tired, and the bite was now only a dull, throbbing pain. I drifted in and out of consciousness.

Until I heard two voices in the room.

I snapped my eyes open for a moment to see the doctor and a nurse hovering over me. They were talking softly to each other, looking concerned. I quickly shut my eyes again, pretending to be asleep.

I caught a snatch of their conversation.

“It’s just like that man,” the nurse whispered. “The one that was admitted last night, John something?”

A pause. “I know.”

“What do you think this is?”

“I don’t know, Rita. I really don’t.”

“Do you think we should give her diazepam? Preventatively?” the nurse asked. “The other one… he screamed so much…”

“The family’ll ask questions. There’s no reason for her to be on diazepam for an animal bite.”

“They’ll ask questions when she’s dead, too,” the nurse snapped back. “The least we can do is make her comfortable—”

“Sssshhh.”

*Oh shit.* I didn’t open my eyes, but I’d jumped when the nurse said *dead.* I now could feel both of them looking at me, their eyes boring through my closed lids.

“Let’s talk somewhere else,” the doctor said.

Hurried footsteps on tile.

And then nothing.

I opened my eyes. *I’m… I’m going to die?*

I don’t know how long I lay there, wallowing in my own misery, but footsteps jolted me awake. Luke was walking back in. “How’s the pain now?”

“Bad.”

I told him what I’d overheard, my voice quavering. “That doesn’t mean anything,” he said—but I could hear the concern in his voice. “We’re going to get out of here, and everything’s going to go back to normal. The mayor or whatever will release some statement about a faulty alert system, and—”

“*Stop.”*

He looked at me warily, but shut up.

The two of us sat in silence. A few times Luke opened his mouth, looking like he was going to say something—but then quickly shut it again. Footsteps pattered by outside in the hallway. The tinny sounds of the TV droned on in the corner.

“I’m going to call Richele,” I told him.

The line rang three times before she picked up. I told her everything—about the bite, about the things I saw. I was afraid of sounding crazy, but when I’d finally finished, she sounded like she was crying on the other side.

“I saw my baby,” she said in a low tone, barely above a whisper. “I had… I had a miscarriage at fourteen weeks. And I saw this, this little basket, with a tiny pink thing bundled up inside… and I heard her cry.” Her voice broke. “I knew it wasn’t real, but I still went toward it. Before Ravi pulled me back.”

“I’m so sorry,” I said, the phone trembling in my hands.

“Thank you…”

“But it didn’t—it didn’t hurt you, right? Bite you? Claw you?”

“No… I don’t think so…”

The silence stretched out between us.

“So what do we do?” I asked. “Just run from it, forever?”

“I’ve been talking to someone. Someone who knows about this more than we do,” she replied. “Maybe I should come see you. What hospital are you at?”

She told me she’d be there in an hour.

\*\*\*

Richele was a short, thin woman with brown skin and thick-framed glasses. She wore a T-shirt with some sort of video game reference on it and faded jeans. As she hurried in, she was wringing her hands, twisting them over and over again.

Following after her was a woman in her 50s. Her salt-and-pepper hair was cropped short, and her skin was deathly pale, like she’d never seen the sun.

“This is Jamie,” Richele said, gesturing to the older woman. “She’s a professor, and specializes in this kind of stuff. I’ve been talking to her for the past few hours, and she wanted to see you.”

*This kind of stuff?*

The woman abruptly sat down, and leaned in towards me, like I was some kind of specimen she was eager to examine. “You know what’s going on here?” I asked, as she stared at my my shoulder in a way that made me extremely uncomfortable.

“Yes. Sort of. Have you ever heard of something called speculative evolution?”

“…No?” I replied.

“Okay. It’s reconstructing what kinds of creatures would evolve under different circumstances. Maybe an amphibian would evolve to have wings like a bat, for example, if insects didn’t hover around ponds. You see what I mean?”

“Uh… I guess…”

“We also try to construct what animals might look like millions of years from now. Or humans. What kind of things will evolve under the pressure of modern humanity, modern technology. There’s already some of it happening. The bedbugs in New York City are hundreds of times more resistant to pesticides than the ones in Florida are. Deer are more skittish than they were ten years ago, because cars kept hitting them.”

“Okay…” I had no idea where she was going with this.

“You haven’t seen that image of what humans would look like if they were evolved to survive car crashes? The man has, like, no neck, and lots of fat to cushion the impact?”

“No…”

“Okay.” She shook her head. “The point is, some people in this field believe that at some point, creatures would evolve abilities that mimic technology. Like birds that look like drones, or bats that can sense electromagnetic fields. Who’s to say this thing, that you and Richele have described, hasn’t evolved the ability to send out radio signals? Hack our entire mobile system?”

“That’s ridiculous,” Luke interjected. “So, what, this creature is like, texting? In English?”

“No, no, nothing like that. States, local governments, they often have pre-programmed emergency messages. Like a protocol for hurricanes, earthquakes, nuclear threats… et cetera. This thing, it just hacked a signal to send a particular protocol. Same thing with Richele,” she said, looking sympathetically at her. “We’re all sending little electromagnetic signals in our brains, all the time. Neural impulses. Sharks, 400-million-year-old living fossils, can detect them. These things? They can *hack* them.”

“So when I saw… my dad…” I glanced at Luke. “That thing was… hacking my brain signals?”

Jamie nodded. “It’s a little more complicated than that—I believe this thing sends out a chemical in the air, too, at close range that messes with some neurotransmitters—but essentially, yes.”

“Okay, but why is the basement safe, then? Because it’s too big to get down there?” Luke asked.

“I’m glad you asked,” Jamie replied, with a big, victorious smile on her face. Like she was just about to tell us the secret to the universe. “They chose *that* emergency protocol, with the basement, because their abilities don’t work if you’re underground. Just how your phone reception goes out when you’re underground.”

A heavy silence filled the room. Luke and I looked at each other. For one, this sounded pretty… out there. Conspiracy-theory level stuff. More unbelievable than Roswell. On the other hand… *nothing* I’d experienced in the past twenty-four hours made sense.

“How… how do you know all this?” I asked.

“This isn’t the first time this has happened,” she replied, her face grim. “Almost ten years ago, the same thing happened, out by Woodland. On the border of Wharton State Forest. I studied it then, too—but there weren’t as many of them.”

“Okay, but the texts didn’t get sent to everyone,” Luke said. “Only us and Richele, so far, that we know of.”

“Right. So these things—I call them stick men, by the way—they only target people with overactive imaginations. People who send out really clear, strong brain signals. It’s easier for them to find you, and it’s easier for them to hack your brain. They’re not actually producing the image you see of your deceased loved ones or whatever. They’re just knocking it loose from your memory, from something you’ve imagined. If you’ve imagined your kid dying a thousand times, because you have anxiety or OCD, that makes it all the easier for them to use it against you and lure you in. And, of course, there’s more for them to eat.”

“…More for them to eat?”

“Yeah. They eat brains. I… I mentioned that, didn’t I?”

More awkward, heavy, suffocating silence.

“Kate said she heard the doctor saying she’s going to die,” he said in a soft voice. “Is that true?”

Jamie glanced at me, but stayed silent. Richele jumped in, her voice full of heartache. “Jamie told me, once it bites you… it’s linked to you. It will follow you, and… and end you.”

“It’ll show you your worst nightmares first,” Jamie interjected, absolutely unable to read the room. “Show you everything you fear. But when it starts showing you yourself, in these waking nightmares… that usually means you only have a day left.”

I swallowed a wave of nausea.

Then I started getting out of the hospital bed. I needed to get out of here. Away from Jamie’s stare. Luke’s concern. Just a moment of silence. Maybe I’d get a coke from the vending machine. Not even a diet one. I hadn’t had a full sugar one in ages.

I tried to keep out the memory of my dad before me, in my mom’s basement.

I *had* imagined him saying those exact words. When I was at my lowest point years ago, when a flicker of suicide showed itself in an ocean of post partum depression.

And that fucker, the *Stick Man* or whatever, had used it against me.

Another wave of nausea. I pushed towards the door—

“Wait,” Richele said, standing up, reaching for my arm.

“I’ll be right back,” I snapped.

I made my way down the empty hospital hallway. Beeping machines, echoey footsteps in the distance. Tears pricked my eyes. I kept going, making a left, then a right, following the signs for the vending machines. My feet shuffled along the ground, taking me there slowly, ever so slowly.

“Kate! Stop!”

I turned to see Luke coming after me. He stopped six feet away, trying to give me space. “I just need a minute,” I replied, my voice shaky.

“No, no. It’s not that. Your mom just texted me, and we… we have to go. Grace…”

His voice broke.

My heart broke with it.

“What? What happened?”

“She fell,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “She’s not conscious. They’re rushing her to the hospital…”

*To the hospital…*

“You mean here? They’re taking her here?” I asked, frantically.

“They’re taking her to the hospital,” he repeated.

Something twinged inside me. *That doesn’t make sense. That’s not an answer…*

I looked down.

*No.*

On the floor. Something black, slick and wet, on the green linoleum floor. A tendril, like a long umbilical cord, attached to Luke’s foot and leading down the hallway.

I felt dizzy. The world started to tilt—

“Kate!”

I turned around to see Luke behind me, frozen, eyes wide.

I looked back—

Other-Luke was no longer standing there.

It was *me*.

I was staring at my own face. I wish I could say it looked different—one eye popping out, skin all blistered and pink—but it wasn’t. It looked exactly like me. Like looking in a mirror.

I looked down.

Other Me was holding a pillow. She held my gaze for a second—then looked down at the floor.

I followed her gaze.

Grace was lying at my feet. Eyes closed, hands resting neatly under her head. Fast asleep.

*No, no, no.*

I knew this intrusive thought.

I knew how it ended.

*It’s not real. It’s not real.* I turned and ran back down the hallway, reaching for Luke’s hand. Rustling behind me. I couldn’t look back. I couldn’t. Luke pulled me into the room and I followed, breathless.

“We have to get underground! It’s here!”

Richele and Jamie looked at me.

Then they looked at the floor.

For a second, I thought I was going to see my worst nightmare. But instead, I looked down to see blood dripping off my arm. Seeping through my shirt, traveling in wet, soaky rivulets, dripping to the floor.

*Drip, drip, drip.*

Jamie shot up and walked over to me. Gently, she pushed back the cloth of my shirt, exposing the wound on my shoulder.

“Necrotic tissue,” she whispered. She shook her head sadly. “It’s begun.”
