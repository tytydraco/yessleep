Some places, you expect to be haunted.

The Hollywood apartment building where I live with my girlfriend, built in 1935, with an out-of-tune piano in the lobby?  Definitely playing host to a spirit or two.  The respiratory hospital, once an insane asylum, where my grandmother died?  A malicious presence Hilton.  Murder houses, old churches, my antique Pasadena elementary school: all ghost catnip. 

You know what isn’t supposed to be haunted?

The sleek, modern office building in Century City where I work.  Finished in 2019 and featured in Architectural Digest Magazine, the Century Premium Business Complex is a glass-walled marvel with state-of-the-art security, a private underground parking lot, and an elevator system designed to streamline employee access.  My employer rents out the entire twelfth floor.  

Unexplained supernatural crap shouldn’t have existed within a mile of the place.  

But then again, plenty of things shouldn’t exist.

\*\*\*\*\*

“The water in the bathroom’s still off, right?” Keegan asked me.  “Christ.  They couldn’t pick a better week?”

I looked up from my computer and nodded.  “The bathroom in the lobby is open.”

“Screw that.  I’ll just go down to the eleventh floor.”

Keegan strode off, and I didn’t give his potty problem a second thought.  He was right.  Remodeling a business management firm’s bathrooms the second week of March - when every tax accountant is neck-deep in S-corporate returns for our clients’ many, many loan outs - had to be a breach of someone’s code of conduct.  

At nearly ten at night, Keegan and I were still camped out in the tax office (management said I wasn’t allowed to call it the tax hole).  Keegan, the firm’s rising star, had buried himself in the cooked books of a new client’s monumentally-screwed charitable foundation.  I, less shiny than Keegan, was trying to wrap up a complicated LLC - and my balance sheet hung off balance by sixty-three dollars.  

Forty-five minutes later, I found my mistake - I’d flipped a six and a nine - and realized that Keegan still hadn’t returned from the restroom.

His screensaver bounced.  His Red Bull lingered, forgotten.  *Was he constipated*?  I thought.  Or maybe, he’d decided he’d hit his daily quota for staring at wonky charity books, and decided go home after his trip to the john.

Whatever.  I’d hit my daily quota for staring at K-1s.  I shut down my computer and concluded I’d talk to Keegan the next day.

The next day, though, Keegan didn’t come into work.  Or, the day after that.

I texted him, he didn’t respond.  I asked co-workers; they had no idea what was up with him.  Finally, on Friday, after neither hide nor hair of Keegan had surfaced for nearly four days, I consulted Matt the Tax Partner.

“Keegan quit,” Matt said plainly.  “He got a new job.  He emailed the partners.”

“That’s bullshit,” I said.  

It had to be bullshit.  For starters, no accountant quits a job or finds a new one in the middle of tax season.  And especially not an accountant like Keegan.  Keegan was a Company Man with a capital C and M.  He’d started as an intern his junior year of college and gave no indication he wanted to leave, ever.  He actually said he intended to make partner someday.  Quitting in the middle of the night on March the ninth definitely wasn’t consistent with Keegan’s brand.  

“I’m serious,” Matt said defensively.  “I can show you the email.”

He clicked something and beckoned me to his side of the desk.  Keegan’s resignation email was open on his monitor.

*Matt, Kevin, Liz, Andrew, and the rest the JGS team -* 

*I apologize for the late notice, but I will not be returning.  As of tomorrow, I’ve accepted an exciting new position, at a higher salary, with a competing business management firm.  Thank you for the professional opportunity you allowed me, and best of luck in the coming business year.*

*Sincerely, Keegan R.*  

As I read, my low-key concern for Keegan dissipated, and blind fury boiled up to replace it.  The asshole quit with zero warning, and since I was the only other tax department junior accountant, he’d essentially guaranteed all his work would be dumped on me.  

*Classy move, dickhead*, I texted him.  *After tax season, I’m going to kill you.*  

\*\*\*\*\*

For awhile, I didn’t think much about Keegan.  

I mean, I didn’t forget he'd existed.  For the rest of tax season, whenever I was assigned a new mammoth tax return marked up with Keegan’s notes, I’d shake my fist at the sky and curse his name.  But the unsettling weirdness surrounding his disappearance ceased to bother me.  Until late May.

On my way into the building, as I waited for the parking lot sensor to read my security placard, I watched a tow truck drive the opposite direction - out of the lot, towards the street.  It towed a blue Honda Civic with a Cal State Northridge bumper sticker and Playa del Rey Surf decal on the back window.  

Keegan’s car.

All of a sudden, clarity knocked me over like a tidal wave.  Keegan vanished weeks before.  In the middle of the night.  After leaving the office to taking a piss on the 11th floor.  He never answered my texts or calls.  He’d quit by sending the partners a short, odd email that sounded like it was written by a cheap AI.  And apparently, his Honda had been parked in the building lot since then.

No one else in the office shared my concern.

“Are you sure it was Keegan’s car?”  Matt asked.  “There’s a lot of Civics in the world.”

“Do you really think he’s the first employee to quit at an inopportune time?” Lisa, the senior tax accountant, droned boredly.  

“It’s not like he’s in any actual danger,” Izzy, one of the bookkeepers, said confidently.  “Haven’t you seen his Facebook account?”

I hadn’t.  I log onto Facebook once a year, to respond to Happy Birthday messages from my aunts and grandparents.  But social media was an avenue I hadn’t explored yet.  I did follow Keegan on Twitter and Instagram - and both accounts, I then realized, had been deleted.  

I typed *Keegan R* into the Google search bar on my phone.  A Facebook page popped up.  

In his profile picture, Keegan - with gelled-back hair and a sterile smile - posed in front of a blurry, indistinguishable office building in a sport coat and striped tie.  His photo banner was a photo of the Los Angeles skyline.  The Education section of his profile listed a Bachelor’s in Accounting from Cal State Northridge.  No employment information.  

I scrolled down.  His entire wall seemed to be a series of generic quotes, the type you’d see on a corporate pamphlet.  

*Do or do not.  There is no try.  - Yoda*

*Losers sit around and cry about the injustices done to them.  Winners turn those injustices into fuel to ignite the fire within.*

*They sleep.  We grind.*  

Useless, wannabe-inspirational crap like that.  

Keegan had created the page recently - on March tenth, the day after I’d last seen him.  *New job, new Facebook profile.*  The first post was a photo, taken in a bright restaurant with exposed brick walls and blue flowers, of Keegan and a woman.  The woman was slender and willowy, with long red hair and wide-set blue eyes.  

*At Lola Trattoria with Bae*, the tag read.  

*Bae*?  New girlfriend, too, apparently.  Keegan had had a girlfriend.  I’d met her at a couple office parties, and she definitely wasn’t the woman in the photo.  The girlfriend I’d known was short and round-faced with glasses.  

The chick in this Facebook picture?  I couldn’t put my finger on it, but she was *wrong*, somehow.  Like one of those cursed images people put on Tumblr.  The longer I stared at her face, the more uncomfortable I became.  

I dug through Keegan’s friends list instead.  It was short, only thirty-one people, and it was odd.  Not odd because I didn’t recognize any of them - plenty of people don’t follow their co-workers on Facebook - but because they all seemed so random.  Like, there was no one from Northridge, or the Jesuit high school Keegan attended, or his surfing club, or his amateur photography meetups.  Just a series of moderately attractive young professionals from an assortment of cities.  

Stephanie, a junior advertising executive in Minneapolis.

James, an intellectual property attorney in New Orleans.  

Adrielle, a marketing manager in New York.  

Rick, a software engineer in London.  

I logged onto my own account and sent Keegan a friend request, then put the strange Facebook page to the back of my mind and focused on work.  It wasn’t until later that day, as I headed down to the lobby for lunch, that the most glaring oddity of Keegan’s disappearance knocked me upside the head.

He’d said he was going to the bathroom on the 11th floor. 

The way the elevators are programmed in our building, you need to scan an ID card.  My ID card, Keegan’s card, the cards belonging to anyone in my office *only* got us to our office, on the 12th floor.  I couldn’t, say, pop into the ad agency on the 15th floor - unless someone who worked there called down to security and explicitly requested I be allowed up.  Then, security could program me a temporary badge.  

But even if Keegan had managed to game the system, or obtain a temporary badge, he still couldn’t have gotten to the eleventh floor from ours.  See, different elevators are programmed to go to specific places.  And ours was programmed for the 12th to the 18th floors.  So, if Keegan wanted to go to the 11th floor, he’d need to take the elevator back down to the lobby, then get on a second, *different* elevator back up.  Which seemed like a lot of effort for a quick pee.

Maybe he’d descended the stairs instead.

I tested that hypothesis that afternoon.  I entered the stairwell through the emergency exit at the back of my office.  I clambered down one set of fire stairs to a platform, then another flight, and another platform, and a third flight, and yet another platform - this one with a push door.  

The door was unlocked.  I shoved my way through it - and into the West Coast Life Insurance lobby, facing a pissy-looking receptionist behind a desk.  

West Coast Life Insurance rented the 10th floor.  

So the stairs just… skipped the 11th.  Or, the emergency exit on the 11th floor had been boarded and patched up.

\*\*\*\*\*

“Whaddya want on the eleventh floor?” the tired-looking security guard asked me, a suspicious frown on his face.  

I smiled at him placatingly.  “I just…” I stuttered, “how would I get there?  To, like, use the bathroom if I need to?”

“You can use the bathrooms in the lobby or the parking lot,” he replied sternly.  “There’s nothing on the eleventh floor.”

My eyes involuntarily twitched towards the guard’s own ID card, sitting on the desk by his computer.  I knew - and he knew I knew - that security staff’s cards function as master keys for the elevators, able to override the system and access any floor.  

“There’s nothing on the eleventh floor,” the man repeated, nearly snarling.  “You don’t ever need to go there.  No one needs to go there.”

\*\*\*\*\*

“Some people, a switch goes off in their heads,” said blonde, dimpled Lawyer Kyle.  “Like lemmings.  But instead of jumping off a cliff, they quit their job and disappear into the void.”

My girlfriend, Tara, is an entertainment lawyer.  Before you ask: yes, she makes considerably more money than I do.  But she’s got three years of USC Law School loans to pay back.  My accounting degree - from night school, while I bartended to pay rent, after it became apparent my dreams of success as a movie stunt man weren’t going to pan out - had been a considerably less hefty financial investment.  So, for the moment at least, we’re equal.

She works in Century City as well, a couple blocks from my office.  On summer Fridays, we’d get together for happy hour at a local cocktail bar with co-workers, to share work gossip and bitch about problem clients.  I’d brought Keegan along a few times.  That day, though, it was me and the lawyers. 

“I used to work as in-house counsel for a marketing firm in Manhattan,” Kyle continued.  “This smoking-hot blonde chick worked there, Adrielle.  At the firm Christmas party, she said she was going to an empty office to call her boyfriend.  None of us ever saw her again.”

“But she’s alive, right?” Tara cut in, through sips of her martini.  

Kyle nodded.  “Yeah.  She’s still on social media and everything.  She just cut and ran; stopped talking to everyone at work.  Even the other chicks she was real tight with.  No idea why she did it.  She was, like, the firm’s golden child.  The partners loved her.  If she wanted more money, I’m sure they would’ve given her a raise.”

The topic of conversation shifted to a married client’s affair with the pool boy.  But Lawyer Kyle’s words still bounced around in my head.  Blonde Adrielle, the missing Manhattanite.  Her story was disturbingly similar to Keegan’s.  Beloved employee, gone in an instant with no explanation.  Adrielle made a call in an empty office; Keegan took a piss on an abandoned floor.  

But also.  *But also.*  

I knew Adrielle - or, at least, I knew where to find her.  On Facebook.  On Keegan’s friends list.

\*\*\*\*\*

As soon as Tara and I returned to our apartment, I logged into Facebook.  Keegan had, apparently, rejected my friend request.

I found Adrielle’s page.  She was, as Kyle reported, a pedestrian-pretty blonde with dimples and a nice ass.  In her profile picture, she lifted a green cocktail, smiling saucily.  Her banner, like Keegan’s, was a cityscape - the New York skyline.  BA in marketing management from Baruch College.  Employed as a marketing manager at Yellow Flower Media.  Her profile was littered with self-important, rise-and-grind quotes - a dash of lean-in corporate feminism sprinkled over the top for flavor.  

*She said she could, and so she did.*

*Most girls dream of marrying the smartest, strongest, richest boy.  I’d rather be smarter, stronger and richer than all the boys.*

Her profile was older than Keegan’s, and she’d posted more pictures.  Her, sitting with a Ken Doll-looking man at a trendy sushi restaurant.  Grinning, ready to run the New York Marathon.  More colorful drinks, surrounded by an interchangeable herd of inoffensively-pretty blondes.  Leaned against a railing, East River behind her, arms wrapped around a skinny redhead with wide-set blue eyes.  

*Bae*, I recognized.  Keegan’s girlfriend. 

Adrielle tagged her by name.  Rosula.  

The sight of Rosula gave me the same unsettled, instinctive gut kick she had before.  It was her eyes.  Or her alien-skinny arms.  Or the drape of her red tank top.  Something.  What sort of name was Rosula, anyways?

I clicked out of Facebook and onto Google.  I needed to research Yellow Flower Media.  If I could find where Adrielle worked, then… then I didn’t know.

A few pages popped up - LinkedIn accounts.  From Adrielle’s profile, I found the Yellow Flower Media corporate website itself.  

For a marketing firm, their site was… well, forgettable.  It was as though they’d gone out of their way to make their internet footprint as drab, dull and generic as possible - from the Times New Roman font, to the links that didn’t work, to the About Us section, which consisted of a single, barely-readable paragraph.  Something about ROI to drive content engagement with search engine optimization through business-to-business synergy in the brand space… it read like it was written by a chatbot with Tourette’s.  

Confused and frustrated, I pulled up the Wayback Machine.  I searched for Yellow Flower Media there.  In a second, I had a hit.

Yellow Flower Media had been a marketing firm in East Midtown Manhattan.  They’d worked with internet start-ups in the late 90’s and early 2000’s, then closed permanently in 2005.

\*\*\*\*\*

That Saturday, I drove to Faerie Tale Cafe, a Koreatown coffee place with big tables and comfy chairs, to study for the CPA exam.  It was something I needed to do - study, take the exams, get certified.  I’d been procrastinating, because everything associated with the CPA exam was about as interesting as watching paint dry. 

But I needed a break.  A break from disappearing blondes and ghost marketing agencies, from Facebook and creepy Rosula, from Keegan’s old clients and Keegan’s empty desk, and just… Keegan.  I couldn’t deal with how much space the guy took up in my head.

In line for my coffee, though, I was rudely reminded of how I knew about Faerie Tale Cafe in the first place.  Keegan took me there, once.  He’d lived in Koreatown.  And it was Keegan’s face I found myself staring into, his photograph printed on a flier pinned up on the cafe’s community board.  

*MISSING PERSON*

*Keegan R.*

*25 years old, 5’10, brown hair, hazel eyes.  Missing since March 10th.*  

I felt like a hundred-pound wrecking ball hit me square in the chest.  I nearly sunk to my knees right there, overcome with both vindication and abject terror.  I wasn’t crazy or exaggerating - Keegan had gone missing under suspicious circumstances.  

There was a number on the flier.  I sat down at a table and dialed it.  A young woman answered.

“I saw your flier,” I started, weakly.  “I’m…uh, I was a friend of Keegan’s.  And I think we should talk.  Um… do you know the Faerie Tale Cafe?  Stupid, of course you know it…”

“Give me ten minutes,” the woman cut in, then hung up.

Ten minutes later, a young Korean woman with a round face, curly hair and glasses walked into the Faerie Tale Cafe.  I waved her over.  I knew her - she was Keegan’s girlfriend, or ex-girlfriend.  Lauren.  Laura?

“You’re Francis, right?” She asked as she sat down.  “I remember you from the Christmas party.”

“Yeah,” I said.  “And you’re Lauren?”

“Leslie,” she corrected. “You wanted to talk about Keegan.”

“I saw him that night,” I told her.  “He said he was going to the bathroom on the 11th floor and then… then he was gone.”  Even in my head, I sounded like an idiot.  

But Leslie smiled appreciatively.  “So you were the last person to see him.”

“I think so.”

Keegan had been off for awhile, she explained.  It started small - she’d find him staring, unblinking, into space, for minutes at a time.  Then, those staring-at-nothing attacks began happening while he was driving.  He’d miss a turn, or a freeway exit, on a route he’d taken so many times muscle memory should’ve kicked in.  

The two of them liked trying new restaurants a couple times a week.  For these outings, Keegan began suggesting random places he claimed his friends recommended.  Leslie would Google the name, and find out Keegan’s suggestion was a restaurant shut down long ago.  Some were relics that hadn’t been open since Keegan was a small child.  

Next, it was movies.  Keegan would throw out a film title - again, a recommendation from a friend or co-worker - that didn’t exist.  Sometimes, when Leslie would search for the movie, she’d find it had been a script a famous actor or director had been attached to, then abandoned, leaving the project un-produced. 

“We got together in college,” Leslie told me.  “We were supposed to get engaged this year.  Then, he stopped answering his phone and sent me a six-word email: I think we should break up.”

“Does he have any family?” I asked.

“Only child, mom died last year, doesn’t talk to his dad, if he has any grandparents or cousins or aunties I don’t know them.”

“Did you… see his Facebook page?” I ventured.  

She nodded.  “He’s got a LinkedIn, too.  Apparently, he’s working for some business management firm called Crowley, Wilkes and Company - with no address, no phone number, and no online reviews.  He writes like ChatGPT got drunk and tried to mimic a White Guy Who Works in an Office.  It’s not him, Francis.  Someone is pretending to be Keegan online.  A shit AI, or a Russian troll, or…”

“The redhead,” I offered.  

Leslie stared at me, eyes wide and wild.  “Like I said.  That isn’t my Keegan in those pictures.”

\*\*\*\*\*

Leslie and I didn’t have much more to say to each other, so I went home.  I logged back into Facebook and opened Keegan’s page.  He’d added to it - a few more generic motivational speaker quotes, and some photos.  Whoever Facebook Keegan was, they knew enough about real Keegan recreate his hobbies.  A whole series of shots captured Keegan at the beach with his surfboard.  In one, he and Rosula posed with their arms snaked around each other.  

Again, Rosula’s wrong-ness hit my brain like an off-key note in a song.

My breath caught in my throat.  I’d figured it out.

One of Rosula’s slender, pale, freckled arms was wrapped around Keegan’s waist.  Another slender, pale, freckled arm terminated in a dainty hand, clasping Keegan’s chin.  And a third slender, pale, freckled arm clutched a yellow surfboard.  

Either this chick had three arms, or she’d been poorly photoshopped.

Her eyes were two-dimensional.  Her shadow bent the wrong way.  In one bikini shot, her belly button was missing.  

\*\*\*\*\*

Whoever - or whatever - managed Keegan’s Facebook page, Adrielle's Facebook page, and all their friends’ Facebook pages had an uncomfortable stranglehold over information on the surface web. 

Utilizing the Wayback Machine, though, I found traces of the people they used to be.  

I uncovered an old Instagram profile belonging to Stephanie, the junior advertising executive from Minneapolis.  Before her posts abruptly stopped in 2019, she’d shared photos of her ugly dog and thoughts that weren’t yuppie cliches.  I dug up an old cooking blog kept as a side project by James, the intellectual property attorney in New Orleans.  The last entry - from 2020, detailing James’s adventures making sourdough bread - had 56 comments.  All some version of “where are you, man?”  Or, “please call me, sweetie.”  Or, “I just want to know you’re alive.”  A missing persons report had been filed by the family of Rick, the London software engineer, back in 2015.  

Crowley, Wilkes and Company, an LA-based business management firm, shut its doors permanently in 2011.  Lola Trattoria, the aesthetically-pleasing Italian restaurant where Keegan dined with Rosula, went under in 2009.  

Suddenly, a Facebook message popped up, catching my attention.  

A direct message from Rosula.  

*Want friend?*

I was seized by burning panic.  *Who are you?*  I responded.

*Want you my friend?*  

*Where is Keegan?*  I typed.  

*Keegan mine.*  

*Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine...*

My stomach hit the floor.  I closed out of Facebook.  I turned off my computer.

I needed answers.  

And I knew where I needed to go to get those answers.

\*\*\*\*\*

It really wasn’t an advertisement for building security, just how easily I snuck past the night guards.

I cased the joint for a few days.  After eight, only two security guards watched the lobby.  The east side security guard kept his headphones in and his eyes down, only bothering to glance up in response to footsteps or voices.  The west side security guard - a guy about my age and my build - always came with a big thermos of coffee and, between nine and nine-thirty, retreated to the bathroom for ten to twelve minutes.  

The next Friday, I ducked into a stall in the lobby men’s room.  I waited there until I saw the black slacks and shined shoes of the west side security guard in the stall next to mine.  Then, I threw on my own black jacket - the same style the security team wore - and sauntered confidently to the west side security desk.  The east side security guard barely looked at me as I snatched up the west side security guard’s key card.  

\*\*\*\*\*

The electricity was out on the eleventh floor, but the glass walls allowed in all the moon light and street light I needed to find my way around.  Over the reception desk, metallic letters - C, W, C - still hung.  

The office layout mimicked mine - mostly open plan, with glass-walled private workspaces for seniors and partners.  I got the impression whatever business once rented the place had left in a hurry.  Boxes of file folders rested in collapsing pyramids and piles, around overturned desks and picked-apart electronics.  A thin coat of dust rested over everything.  I looked down and saw a trail of shoe-prints.

I followed the shoe-prints, past scattered plastic flowers, busted printers, crates of unopened mail and dried-out highlighters, emptied metallic file cabinets.  Then, the footprints stopped.  

It took an earth-shattering minute for my brain to process the thing in front of me.

A body.  A *human fucking body*.  Eyes, decomposed.  Skin, leathery and brown, like a prop mummy at a haunted house.  Long, yellow nails.  Lips, dust.  Nose.  Teeth.  Burrowing maggots.  Patches of curly brown hair.  Khaki pants, green shirt.

Keegan’s green shirt.  *Keegan.*

Beyond Keegan’s putrid body, there were more.

The second corpse had been reduced to a grey husk.  The dirty white skeleton of the third, sprawled between desk chairs like discarded debris, was all that remained.  

“Did you find what you came for, Francis?” chirped a female voice, like a robot on an answering machine.  

I spun around. 

Rosula loomed over me, ill-proportioned and monstrous.  Nearly as tall as the ceiling, on stick-thin legs, her wiggling arms nearly brushed the ground.  Red hair an unmoving mold.  Wormlike fingers, too long.  A toothy smile cut across her two-dimensional face.  Her eyes bulged like a squeezable toy.  Morphing and twisting and flattening, flickering and glitching like a demented hologram.

She reached for me.  I turned to run - and felt my feet stick to the floor.  

It coated the scattered documents, the abandoned desks, the forgotten office supplies.  It dripped from the ceiling and down the glass walls, pooled on the floor.  

A shimmering, gelatinous substance, the color of spit, the consistency of maple syrup.  It throbbed.  It gathered itself around the three bodies, hugging them, engulfing them.  It reared up in little tendrils, like a curious nest of snakes, tentatively sniffing me, sensing me, figuring me out.  

The substance sparkled, jittered.  Like it was… something it couldn’t be.  Pixelated.  

Then I felt warm, breathing ropes wrap themselves around my ankles.  

*I wasn’t built to work in an office.  I was supposed to be a professional stuntman.*  

I jerked, kicked, and twisted my body, breaking away from the pixelated jelly’s grasp.  It hissed.  I whirled to face Rosula.  Eyes red, teeth bared, she lunged at me with her alien hands.  I dove.  I rolled between her legs.  And I ran.  

I ran for the emergency exit.  I burst through the door, tore apart the plywood and plaster patching that had sealed the office from the fire stairs, and threw myself down.  Stairs, platform, stairs, platform… I ran and ran and ran, not pausing, not thinking, until I felt the warm summer night air on my face.  

Outside the Century Premium Business Complex, I collapsed into the grass, coughing and panting and sobbing.  I lay on the lawn until I’d regained enough of my reality to realize I needed to get myself up and go home.  I sat and stared up at the sleek, modern office building.  Through the glass walls, I saw faces.

Rosula’s, shifting and flickering like a low-budget cartoon.  Keegan.  Adrielle.  All their Facebook friends - the passably pretty, stolen young professionals gone forever from our world, trapped perpetually in that colorless, pixelated slime.  

They didn’t look unhappy.

\*\*\*\*\*

I should’ve quit my job.  Now that I’m aware of the otherworldly horror existing just below my feet, if I were smart, I’d never set foot in the Century Premium Business Complex ever again.  But… why?  That predatory, gelatinous stuff kidnapped yuppies from London, New Orleans, New York, all sorts of places, all over the world.  At least here, I know where it lives.  

I’ve been doing some reading about pocket dimensions.  I won’t pretend to understand the physics, but getting my head around the concept has allowed me to come up with a theory of what, exactly, I faced down on the eleventh floor.

The shimmery, living gelatin collects things from our dimension.  Nonexistent movies, shuttered businesses, closed bars and restaurants, and - sometimes - people.  People like Keegan.  It either keeps them as pets or consumes them for energy.  Given the quick decomposition of Keegan’s body, I’m leaning towards the latter.  

The internet is its interface with our dimension.  It might use social media to stalk targets, or to lure them in.  Or else, Facebook and LinkedIn are a form of camouflage.  If Keegan is still posting on Facebook, then he’s still alive and well, and we don’t have to look for him.  Therefore, no one finds the living goo on the eleventh floor.  Places like the eleventh floor are portals, maybe, between universes.  Outposts, of sorts. 

Rosula is its avatar.  Like the photos it creates and the written language it produces, Rosula is a lousy forgery.  She resembles a human being, just not quite close enough.  

She didn’t want me.  *It* didn’t want me.  It seeks out the cream of the crop, only the best employees.  

Except, now?  I think I impressed it.  

Lately, I’ve caught myself staring into space, imagining happy hour cocktails at Lola Trattoria, recalling that hilarious marketing pun Adrielle taught us, considering which movie I should recommend for Keegan to see on Friday with Rosula.  

Then, I remember Lola Trattoria is closed and Keegan is dead.  

Some places aren’t supposed to be haunted, some things shouldn’t exist, and some people were never meant to work in an office.

But they are, and they do, and I am.  

Yesterday, as I rode the elevator up to work, I realized an extra button had appeared.

The eleventh floor.
