My grandfather was an amazing man.  He grew up in an isolated plot of land in Nebraska with pretty, classically strict religious parents.  No ill talk of them ever left his mouth.  There was always an air of understanding and respect whenever he retold stories of them during his formative years, even about their more…abusive forms of religious education. He lived with them up until his teens, when he joined the Marines and served close to fifteen of his prime years before settling down with his wife, my grandmother, in West Virginia in the early seventies. 

From there, he raised a small family of three kids, one of them my dad, on a beautiful plot of land surrounded by forest, just on the edge of a humble little town.  He always had a vibrant personality, and he was loved by all in town for his wit and good humor. He lived a happy life and enjoyed it even more (so he tells me) when he became a grandpa.  He loved reiterating his life during those years, always smiling with every question asked, knowing he had a crazy answer to give, which in turn demanded a follow-up question.  His ability to grip a room full of stupid, loud kids like my brothers and me still astounds me to this day; he perfected the art of storytelling.  Every experience he shared always ended with a quick summary of how it changed him and how it enriched his development as a person.  From his humble origins as a naive Nebraska native, holding all sorts of prejudices that were instilled in him by his parents, he managed to learn and grow despite them and is easily one of the most open-minded and loving characters I have ever known.  He remained implicitly religious; he considered himself an unspecified flavor of Christianity ever since leaving the suffocating embrace of his Baptist parents. 

He was very hands-off about that stuff, at least with his grandkids. The only times he ever “preached” to us were the few times he decided to read from the Bible instead of orating another episode of his life.  It was always from the book of Revelation, so props to him for choosing a book that would captivate a room full of mostly young boys with wild imaginations.  I loved listening to him recite the passages; he would jump from chapter to chapter and verse to verse. One passage I remember him reading a lot was:

*To him that conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, with a new name written on the stone, which no one knows except him who receives it.*

Even up into my adulthood, I always looked forward to the weekends when I could find time to drive from my little apartment here in Old Town Warrenton, Virginia, to his little homestead in Middle West, VA.  The handful of hours' drive was always made immediately worth it every time I saw that front door open.  His jolly smile was highlighted by a salt-and-pepper mustache,  a bit unkempt, but if I were that old and married to the same woman for the last five billion years, I wouldn't give a shit about my appearance that much either.  All in all, my grandpa was a joy to be around and was always a highlight in my inner circle of loved ones.

About eleven years ago, he was diagnosed with dementia.  It was a shock to me and most of all to my Dad.  What signs were there, we, obviously, had not noticed.  It's crazy how you only begin to notice things once a label is placed on them.  With each visit, it became more visible and more potent.  His smile was the first thing we lost; it was still there, just dimmer.  His eyes were becoming vacant, and his energy progressively diminished.  What hurt the most was his stories.  A couple of years in, they began to be a burden.  It got to the point where each attempt at re-telling one, names were repeated, actions were noted without reason, and locations were jumbled mid-sentence.  The oracle I grew up with was lost in himself.  The archive of his life was being ransacked, and his countless tales and the well they flowed from were drying up.  

One day, about nine years in, he lost it entirely.  The dementia, our family physician told us, was “aggressive”.  It didn’t take a doctor to see that.  He stumbled through time and place when trying to re-tell basic activities he had done that day.  Upon questioning, he would begin to reiterate his day, before, inevitably, putting his finger to his mouth as his mind tried to grasp at the strings of memory that were contorting just out of reach.  

Another year went by, and I hadn’t visited him for about a month or two.  I have to admit I had put off seeing him ever since he struggled to remember my name or my brothers' names.  It's selfish, but I wanted to avoid that hurt again.  When I finally grew a pair and visited him, the same thing happened, as expected at this point.  He would hamstring along a conversation, starting thoughts in the middle and working circularly.  I would smile and nod along, asking few questions.  My heart hurt seeing his once glowing face a shadow of a memory only I could remember.  I wanted to be there for him, so I smiled and went along without much energy put into conversation.  After dinner, I decided to leave a little earlier than planned; however, before I could leave, he pulled me aside to his study. 

I followed him inside.  The rustic, homey atmosphere of that room always filled me with a warm sense of glee and security growing up.  Now, it was a cluttered pile of incoherent design; furniture was moved randomly, and books and papers were scattered aimlessly across desks and chairs alike.  A material manifestation of my grandpa’s illness. 

There was, however, one component of his room that was left in decent order, his safe.  The rather large metal safe was still sitting on its own designated private bookcase, locked and free of dust or debris.  It was still right where I remembered, an unmoving monolith from my childhood. I once asked my grandpa to open it when I was a kid, hoping to find it filled to the brim with cash and gold and maybe even a Tommy gun.  It was the only time he ever sternly denied me anything.  I can remember exactly what he said and how he said it.  “No, he has yet to instruct,” he informed with a seriousness no child could understand.  

I stared at it, reminiscing about that very memory when my grandpa mumbled, “How you’ve grown.”

I turned to share an acknowledging smile, the one you give to those in hospice upon visiting.  He was so frail and small next to me now that I couldn’t help feeling a wave of melancholy wash over my heart.  But when I locked eyes with him, I almost jumped.  His eyes were lucid.  A sharpness had returned to them, something I had not seen expressed from him in years.  I collected myself, hoping that I hadn't flinched openly and hurt his feelings when he reached a hand out to me with a smile whose warmth and mirth I had missed so much I almost wept then and there. 

“How are ya, Clarkson?” 

No stutter, no stammering, no second-guessing, he shook my hand and said my name.  

“I’m great, Papa.”  I gave his hand a firm single shake, the same way he taught me all those years ago before my first job interview.  

“I taught ya well.”  He said, reading my mind, “I’m afraid I don’t have much left to teach you.”

The solemn statement further confused me. “How are you...papa?” was all I could manage to ask.

“Sad and disappointed.  The fruits of my labor were not enough.”

“What do you mean?”  

“Clarkson, did I ever tell ya about my tenth birthday?”

“Yes, you got a hockey stick and ice skates.  And when you went to try them on the lake you wiped out and took three friends with you as you skidded across the ice”  An uncertainty was returning to me, but I clung to the hope that my grandpa was about to be coherent and clear-headed for the first time in years. 

“Oh yes, yes, and I loved my parents ever so much for them skates, God rest their souls.”  He pulled a chair up to me, and I sat.  He heaved onto his leather lounge chair, the very one from which he used to spend so much time reciting his life to us,  

I allowed the familiar warmth of the scenario to fill me with hope for a moment, as he began, “Yes, well… that was not the only gift I received that day.  That night, determined to master skating so as not to embarrass myself in front of my friends yet again, I snuck out.  A daring thing to do with parents like mine,”  He let out a murmurful chuckle as he continued, “Well, there I went, creeping out my lil’ window, hoppin off the roof into the snow below.  With a plop, I landed safely, ice skates still clasped to my chest.”  His glow reanimated his face as he went on.  He was alive, and he was THERE with me in that moment.  He was… he was himself again at last.  

He paused a moment; he was sharp enough to see that I was distracting myself with these thoughts.  With a smile, he continued, “Well, there I was, marching through the woods in the middle of the night, praying to God that I was going in the right direction.  The night was terrible dark, and the snow just began to flutter as I burrowed deeper into the woods in search of the lake.”  He looked longingly at his hands, “I was shivering all the way.  Heh, well, after a few panicked minutes of trudgin along, I finally reached the treeline.  I had a flashlight that I finally dared to turn on, now that I was clear out of sight of my parents’ house.  As I was fumbling with my skates, the strangest thing happened.”  He paused, making sure he had my attention, “The snow stopped, and the clouds blew away in a shrill, cold wind.  I shivered against it before looking up at the night sky… it was a celestial painting I will never forget.  The stars beamed… billions and billions of them all shining clear and sharp, like a blanket of black silk embroidered with diamonds.”  I stared at him as he reminisced, this clear memory a beacon in an otherwise haze of confusion I had seen him live in for years.  

“Then, BOOM!”  He yelled, giving me a start, “It happened.  A shooting star zipped across the sky, cutting across its countless fellows.  I was in awe, its golden tail trailed behind it, then I noticed.  It was coming toward me.”  He grabbed my hand, “And it was coming fast.  I only stared like a dimwit for a few more seconds until I reacted to it burning up in the atmosphere.  It was coming right toward me, I swear on my life it was.  With a jolt, I began running back to the treeline when it made impact with the lake with a sizzling explosion that socked my behind clear off the ground.”  He zipped his hand into the air, “I hit my head pretty good; thankfully, the snow was a cushion for me.  I stumbled off the ground and gave a good look around.  A little uneasily, I scoped out the lake from a distance.  And oh boy, was there a sight to be seen.  A thick fog had erupted following the explosion.  With my flashlight, I dared to march into it to explore the star that nearly snuffed me out.”

He paused and gave me a smile, which I did not understand, but I was happy to see his glow returning as he continued.  “I cut through the thick saturation, and as I approached the cusp of the lake, a red glow emitted just ahead of me.  I continued toward it, every step into the crunchy snow echoing in the fog.  And there it was, I turnt my flashlight directly on it.”

He stared at the mantelpiece in front of our seating, face red with life, eyes beaming with conscious awareness.  “My stone…my egg.”

I didn’t say anything, for fear of insulting him.  I simply let him continue.  “It was… magnificent.  A petite metal the size of a fist.  Smooth as a river stone, pattern of a Damascus blade… and an eternal warmth that I have felt to this day…”  He turned to me, “A generational inheritance I have been eager to reap the reward of.”

I was a little off-put, the returning fear of my grandfather’s condition ached in my stomach as I clawed my mind for a polite response to such a tale of discovery. He gripped my arm lovingly, “I know this is a lot for you to believe, but please, allow me to finish, and I will show you.  It is your inheritance as well, don’t you know.”

I gathered myself and let him finish, “I examined it for a moment, this… divine revelation bestowed to me… I laid my hand on it, and a pulsing heat radiated from it.  It enveloped my body in such a lustrous way… I pocketed it.”  My grandpa seemed to be melting in his chair, “I forgot all about ice skating, and marched back home, my egg in hand.  Its warmth filling me all the while… I snuck back inside and hid it beneath my pillow.  What a night that was… a peace had blanketed me I had never felt before.  I fell drifted off soundly and shortly, only for the dream of the prophecy to come to me in my sleep.”  He raised his now radiating eyes to me, the soft darkness of the room making them glisten all the more.

“It was a revelation I would dream of every night since.  It spoke to me…my egg.  It told me its secrets, of secrets to come… and what it needed from me in the meantime.  With these secrets came my mission, my divine mission!”  His elderly frame seemed to grow, “It…He chose me to cradle this, the seed of our world’s reconciliation.  My boy, you must understand.  I was tasked all these years to mother this egg.  Its secrets of the world to come and guidance on my holy mission were essential to my life all these decades.  Now my time has come… It will take all that is left of me… it is now up to you.  Your inheritance.  You must shelter the second coming of Christ, this egg of our redemption from which He will sprout.”  My grandfather sprang from his seat and went to that safe, that eternal presence in my life.  I watched as he spun its dial left and right in seemingly random patterns before a click signaled its unlocking.  With elderly hands, he pulled the thick little safe door open.  There it sat, as if it always had been, the little meteorite my grandfather had kept all these decades.  Its glistening exterior seemed like a beacon of warmth, a warmth I felt sitting across the room.  With childlike reverence, my grandfather cradled it in his hands and carefully marched over to me, arms extended, presenting my inheritance.  He stood over me, as I remained seated, thoughts racing.  In a whisper, he said, “This, holy relic, must be cared for in my absences.  I have little… left to give it… It has grown hungrier as it's developed.  This divine mission is to be your inheritance.”

He continued for another hour into the night; he went on and on.  I was barely present now; my head was ringing.  New fears of his mental deterioration flooded my mind.  I stared at that smooth extraterrestrial debilitator.  For reasons I would soon find out, it contained the source of this madness that now enveloped my grandfather’s eroding mind.  This supposed seed of the Second Coming.
