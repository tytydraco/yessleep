One second I was sitting there thinking about all the evil I had done—the next, I was outside, barefoot in the grass, chasing my little boy around the yard.

His laughter was a melody I hadn’t heard in years, bouncing off the trees like sunlight through leaves. I could feel the warmth of the sun on my face, the tickle of cut grass between my toes, the sound of his tiny sneakers slapping the earth.

“Daddy, you can’t catch me!”

And for a moment, I couldn’t. My knees were weak—not from age, but from the overwhelming joy I thought I had lost forever. I dropped to my back in the grass, staring at the clouds as he tackled me, and I laughed like I had never done anything wrong.

I think I whispered, “God, please don’t let this be a dream.”

But it was.

Then everything shifted.

I was standing at the altar. My hands were trembling but not from fear—because she was walking toward me. My wife. My light.

Her dress caught the afternoon sun like fire on water, and her smile—God, her smile—could have healed the dead. I remember how tightly she squeezed my hands as we said our vows, how we both laughed and cried at the same time.

The world disappeared in that moment. It was just her and I, promising forever.

And for a moment, we had it.

The memory held like a breath—and then, like a switch, it was gone.

The hospital room smelled like disinfectant and new life. I remember my heart pounding so loud I thought the nurse would tell me to sit down.

But when my daughter arrived—screaming her way into the world—I cried harder than I ever had. I didn’t know you could feel that much love and fear all at once.

Her fingers, impossibly small, curled around mine. I whispered promises to her, things I didn’t even know I believed in yet.

My wife held her, tears streaking her cheeks, exhausted but glowing. “We made this,” she whispered.

And again, I begged the universe to let me stay there forever.

But forever is short. So damn short.

Then—total black.

That is, until I started hearing a ringing noise. It grew louder, morphing into the clanging of massive machines pounding into one another. It was hot—unbearably hot. Like standing inside a forge with no exit. I was suddenly in the street of some industrial complex, under a sky the color of dried blood and rust.

The air tasted like sulfur and soot. My face burned like I was standing too close to molten iron.

The ground buckled.

Or more like I was horizontal to it.

THUD.

I hit the floor. Concrete. Sharp and stained.

“Yeah, we got another one,” a voice said. “These types always seem... I think we’re gonna put this one on the bottom floor. He seems to like it down there.”

I blurted out without thinking, “Fuck you! Get off me! Who are you and where the hell do you think you’re taking me?!”

He chuckled, leaned in close. His breath stank of burning oil.

“I don’t think you’re in any position to be askin’ questions now, are you? But if you must know, my name’s Barnard. And I’m what you’d call the management of this here facility.”

“Facility?”

“You see, when people like you do what you did, I gotta put ’em to work. For all eternity. In this forge.”

He flipped me over and yanked me to my feet. That’s when I saw the full horror.

Massive machines lined the streets, some like colossal presses, others like skeletal arms reaching into furnaces the size of buildings. People—if you could still call them that—were fused to them. Hollow-eyed. Their limbs melded with metal, some with pipes driven through their backs, feeding black smoke into the sky.

One man had needles instead of fingers—long, medical-grade ones that dripped molten fluid into tubes. He didn’t blink. Didn’t scream.

Then there were the "things."

Tall. Elongated. Skinless, and where skin should’ve been, there was tarnished bronze and scorched steel. Their eyes glowed like burning coals, and their movements were jarring—twitching with a metallic screech as if their joints were hinges grinding on bone. They weren’t just watching. They were managing.

They were building more.

Machines with ribcages.

Barnard opened a door, shoved me through, and said, “When you deal with that, we’ll move on.”

Dark again.

When I opened my eyes, I was sitting in an interrogation room. Cold, gray, and too familiar.

A woman walked in screaming, “You killed my son, you piece of shit pig!”

I was a cop again. Undercover. Deep in a drug ring. The boy—he’d pulled a knife on me. Told me he wanted everything I had. I felt threatened. I shot him.

When his body hit the floor, I called for backup. Never thought twice.

Until she walked in.

And it hit me—I hadn’t just defended myself. I’d ended a life. Her baby.

Before I could speak, the door creaked. Barnard pulled me out.

“Not yet. Not time for learnin’ lessons. You’ve got eternity for that.”

“I don’t understand.”

Barnard laughed. “All within due time, my boy.”

As we moved through the factory, I heard it. A deep mechanical breathing—like a machine fighting for air. Mixed with hospital beeping. Then: WHAM. Barnard kicked me down a stairwell.

I hit the bottom.

Black.

Then: light. Soft. Familiar.

My wife and I were in the kitchen, dancing to a song on the radio. She was laughing, barefoot, flour on her cheeks.

Then her face changed.

Fear.

She said someone was watching. She heard voices. Shadows moved in the walls. Days later, I had to make the choice to pull the plug. She wasn’t there anymore—not in any way that mattered.

I collapsed. Screamed. Grabbed at my face like I could tear the grief away.

I just wanted to go back.

“Let’s go!” Barnard's voice shattered the moment.

I didn’t move.

He kicked me in the ribs. “GET THE FUCK UP! You ain’t done yet. We ain’t even made it to your station.”

“One more stop,” he said. “Usually breaks the soul.”

I screamed, “WHY AM I HERE?!”

Barnard paused. “You couldn’t handle it anymore. That’s why most are here. Either that... or you killed ’em.”

“I… killed them?”

He opened the last door. “Good luck.”

Through the smoke, I saw a machine on fire. Something screamed inside it. A chorus of metal and agony.

Then I was in the car. Driving. Blurred vision. Wipers swaying. In the rearview—my babies. My boy. My girl. Peaceful. Sleeping.

Their mother was gone. I had been drinking. Too much. My mother babysat while I drowned myself in bars.

Then: lights.

Screeching brakes.

Metal tearing metal.

Silence.

I woke up. The car was 40 feet away. On fire.

No cries.

Just fire.

I dropped to my knees. Screamed. Pounded the ground till my hands bled.

Barnard stepped in.

“Give me my kids back!” I roared.

“You took them away,” he replied. “Now. Time to get to work.”

We reached my station.

“You’ve got two options,” Barnard said. “Make bullets... or plead to the Big Man Upstairs.”

“I want to see him now.”

“That’s not how this works. You need to reflect.”

“I don’t need shit. I need OUT.”

Barnard let out a shriek—a thousand demons, gears grinding against bone, all in my head. Reality blurred.

He stepped aside.

The Thing behind him—half-machine, dripping organic sludge from between its plates—moved like meat through a shredder.

Barnard bowed. “Sir. He requests your attention.”

I fell to my knees. “I know I was selfish. I lived for myself. But if you give me a second chance, I’ll live for others. I’ll help families. I’ll stop people from going down the road I did.”

The being opened its jaw—metal clanked. It reached down, squeezed my head.

I felt my jawbones grind and snap as they crushed together, my teeth splintering and spilling from my mouth like shattered porcelain. The pressure of its grip only grew, turning my skull into a vice. My eyes bulged, veins bursting, until they were forced from their sockets with a sickening squelch. I could feel the soft tissue of my brain liquefy, bubbling inside my skull like meat in a boiling pot—then, with a grotesque crunch, everything went pop. 

I opened my eyes.

Hospital lights.

I reached up. Half my face—gone.

But I was alive.

And I wasn’t going to waste it.

If you're thinking about ending it—don’t. You don’t want to go down Industrial Boulevard.

Enjoy every second. It could be your last.
