It doesn’t exist. Not anymore.

The Pistol's barrel rests against my left temple, the cold metal pressing into my skin. Felt colder while each second passes way, as I wait to pull the trigger.

"I bought this weapon to protect my family. The past few months have been crazy in our neighborhood. I needed something—anything—to keep them safe."

But now, after learning the truth, a truth I wish wasn’t real… this gun has found a different purpose. There’s no one left to save.

I’m a 32-year-old working man in a corporate, where doing your job better than anyone else comes with its rewards. I work hard, and in return, I get better perks.

I currently live in an apartment consists of 4 bedroom space—not too modern, just the way I (we) like it. Nothing extravagant, nothing more.

I am married to her, she is love of my life, and together, we have two kids. I love them more than anything.

It all started in 2011, fourteen years ago, when I met a girl who changed everything. She (currently my wife) taught me love, affection, and the kind of laughter that stays with you forever.

2011
I was 18—barely thought about academics, never worried about my appearance, and had no clear direction in life. And then there was her—brilliant, effortlessly topping every exam, the most gorgeous person I had ever seen. She was everything I wasn’t, and yet, somehow, our worlds collided.

I still can’t believe it. That this woman—the one I’m married to—is the same girl who once loved me, even when I was just a mess, stuck in a hole with no direction. That this is the same woman who became the mother of my two most adorable munchies. I still wonder how.

We got married early—because I wanted to, she wanted to, we both did. She shaped me in ways I never imagined, turning me into the man I am today.

Two years after we graduated, we tied the knot. Her parents disapproved of her marrying me, and while mine were okay with it, they chose not to attend. Since her family wasn’t coming, my folks decided it was best if they stayed away too.
But none of that mattered. We had each other, and that was enough.

My parents loved her—truly. They liked her a lot, right from the start. Having never had a daughter of their own, they embraced her as one, treating her like family in every way that mattered.

I had everything I ever wanted—my life was filled with love and joy.

After we got married in 2014, at just 22, we moved into a simple studio apartment. It wasn’t much, but to us, it was a love palace. She painted and sketched on the walls, turning them into canvases of our happiness. I adored every stroke, every color she brought into our world.

She always wanted a baby, dreamed of starting a family early. But I asked her to wait. Not because we couldn’t afford it—we had enough—but because I wanted to give our children the best life possible. If you’re a parent, you understand. She was upset, but she understood.

We both worked hard, earning a decent living. Whenever we could, we traveled—sometimes internationally—escaping our busy schedules to explore the world together. And at least once a month, we visited my parents. She loved it there.

It had been a year since we got married, a year since she was separated from her parents. The pain never left her—I could see it, even if she never spoke about it.

She never shared it with me, but I knew.

I tried to reach out. I went to their home, met them face-to-face, and explained everything. I asked them—no, I begged them—to visit us just once.

Seeing me put in so much effort, not for myself but for their daughter’s happiness, something in them shifted. They saw it—the love we shared, the way we belonged together. And in that moment, they understood.

We weren’t just married. We were truly, deeply in love—more than anything else in this world.

They agreed to visit.

Then came the day I had been waiting for—the day I surprised her. I brought her parents' home, and the moment she saw them, her happiness knew no bounds.

It was a day we would remember for the rest of our lives. A day of healing, of love, of family coming together again. And that night, we made another decision—one that would change everything.

We decided to have a baby.

Everything had fallen into place. We were happy. Truly happy. There was nothing more I could ever ask for in this lifetime—or any lifetime.

The Next Year
I sat in the hospital lobby, heart pounding, waiting for the moment that would change our lives forever.

And then, the news came.

A baby girl.

I had always dreamed of having a daughter, while she had hoped for a boy. We had even placed a bet on it—one that I had just won. But in that moment, none of that mattered. All that mattered was that she was here. Our little girl.

And oh man! That feeling—the moment I took her to my hands—was beyond words, beyond anything I had ever known. It was irreplaceable.

In that instant, I wasn’t just a man. I was the luckiest man alive. A husband. And now… a father.

After we were discharged, we returned to our little studio apartment. But suddenly, it felt… small. Not because of its size, but because our love had grown—it had taken shape in the form of our baby girl.

The space was filled with love, warmth, and something new—something bigger than just the two of us.

I knew then that we needed a bigger place. Not just for comfort, but to make sure this love stayed with us, surrounded us, and grew with us.

We bought a new house 4 bedroom space—a beautiful place just down the lane in the same neighborhood. It felt like the perfect step forward, a home where our love could grow.

We had everything—happiness, love, and of course, the little fights that came and went, never strong enough to shake us. Because at the end of the day, we always had each other.

Two Years Gone By
Her father passed away.

I had never seen her like that before—completely shattered, lost in a grief too heavy to carry. She cried for him, and I could do nothing but watch, helpless.

She was just weeks away from giving birth, yet in that moment, she was a daughter mourning her father, not a mother preparing for new life.

And as I held her, watching her break apart, I cried too. Not just for him, but for her—for the pain she couldn’t escape, for the sorrow I couldn’t take away.

Weeks passed, and her mother moved in with us. We couldn’t leave her alone—she wouldn’t, and I definitely wouldn’t.

Now, just two days remain until the delivery. The house feels different—quieter, heavier—but through it all, we hold on. 

We were blessed with a baby boy.

She had no idea what I had planned—I named him after her father. We never spoke about it, never discussed it. But when she saw his name, she looked at me, eyes filled with tears, and asked, "Why?"

I smiled and replied, "For you."

A Year Later
It was my daughter's first day of school.

On the way, excitement filled the car—hers, ours. Watching her in her little uniform, stepping into a new world, brought back memories. My wife and I reminisced about our own school days, sharing stories from our childhood.

I told her about the mischievous things my friends and I did, the fun, the chaos. She, in turn, told me about the boys who had proposed to her back then. I didn’t react—played it cool. But deep down? Yeah, I felt a little jealous.

The parent-teacher meeting went well, and since it was just an introductory four-hour session, we took her home early.
On the way back, we stopped by my parents' place, spent some time talking, had lunch, and then packed some for her mother before heading home. It was a simple day, yet one I knew I’d always remember.

A few weeks passed, and then—the lockdown began. The world came to a halt.

Every day, we prayed. Not just for our family, but for everyone—for every home, every stranger, every life caught in this storm.

The death toll kept rising, day after day, week after week. The numbers were everywhere, but behind them were faces, stories, people. The fear was real, but so was hope. So we held on.

2021
Things started to feel different.

Not in a way that shook our lives, but in the little things—the subtle shifts in behavior. My wife, for instance. She never liked people handing her things, always preferring to take them herself. But now? She had stopped minding. I noticed, but I didn’t question it.

The kids were growing fast. My son had become a little chatterbox, filling the house with his endless words. My parents started spending more time with us, their presence a comforting constant.

But my mother-in-law… she had become so quiet, so dull. I figured it was just age, the weight of time settling in. But deep down, I knew. She missed him. The man she had spent a lifetime with. And no matter how full the house was, some spaces remained empty.

Time was moving forward, but some wounds never truly heal.

Week after week, people started visiting us—family, friends, even those who had never stepped into our home before. It was unexpected, but we welcomed it.

Even my old friends, the ones who never had the time, started dropping by. We enjoyed it. We laughed more. We made memories—hiking, dining out, simply being together.

And then, there was her.

She always smiled at me—this soft, knowing smile. And every time she did, it churned my heart the way she would churn a brick of butter—slowly, deliberately, leaving an ache I couldn’t quite understand.

It was the best time of my life. I just didn’t know how much I would miss it.

As days passed, our neighborhood started to change—it became rough, almost lawless. Violence and robberies became frequent, happening just around our house. Thankfully, we hadn’t been targeted, and there were no direct threats to our lives. Still, the unease settled in. To ensure our safety, I installed the best security system available—anything to protect my family.

Birthdays filled our lives—our children’s, their friends’, our friends’, even my colleagues’. Any occasion was a reason to move, to celebrate, to be around people.

I never drank or smoked. She did—occasionally. At least, I thought she did. Sometimes, at parties, she’d slip away for a minute or two. I never questioned it. But deep down, I knew.

She had told me once, back when we were newly married, that she drank. But when she became a mother, she said she didn’t want to anymore. I never restricted her. It was her choice.

But if she was drinking again… she could have told me.

In November 2023, a homicide shook our neighborhood. Fear settled in, and everyone felt uneasy. That’s when I decided—it was time to get a gun.

Not because I wanted to carry it around, but for protection. I’ve always loved guns—not as weapons, but as a fascination, a collector’s admiration. Maybe it was the action movies I grew up watching. Maybe it was the sense of security it offered.

But this time, it wasn’t just admiration. It was about keeping my family safe.

Everyone—every friend of mine—questioned my decision.

"Why do you need a gun? It’s not necessary."

I understood their fear. They were all unsettled by what happened, but none of them lived here. None of them had to close their eyes at night in this place. I did. My family did.

So I told them, "It’s just for protection. Don’t worry, I’m not planning to play with it." I said it with a laugh, trying to lighten the mood. But deep down, I knew—I wasn’t joking.

There were nights when we’d hear strange sounds—scratches, faint thuds—echoing around the house. Maybe it was just the wind, maybe stray animals, but I never took chances.

I kept the Glock 19 within arm’s reach, right next to the bed. Just in case.

But those were just precautions. The real moment—the one I had always feared, the one that would make me truly need the gun—never came.

Until now. Until today.

Today is February 10, 2025.

Now, Let me ask you a something.

You have everything—a wonderful life, a loving wife, beautiful kids, supportive parents, good friends, a great job, and countless cherished moments.

But what if…
A stranger—someone you’ve never met before, someone who knows nothing about you—looks you in the eye and tells you that your entire life is built on a lie?

If you have even the slightest doubt that I’m lying, see for yourself. Don’t walk in—just take a peek, just a peek.

This feels strange—unlike anything I’ve ever experienced in my entire life. Why should I peek into my own house?

I smiled, brushed off his words, and walked away. But no matter how much I tried, I couldn’t shake the thought.

By the time I reached home, parked the car, and stepped out, his words still echoed in my head. I crossed the pavement, hand reaching for the door—but I hesitated.

Something felt... off. What could be wrong?

What if I just took a peek? It’s my house, after all. If I did that, maybe—just maybe—this strange feeling would finally go away.

So, I stepped away from the door and moved toward the window overlooking the hall. Just a peek, I told myself.

And there it was—nothing.

Everything was exactly as it should be. Of course, it is. This is my house. What could possibly be different?

I let out a quiet laugh, shaking my head at that madman’s words. Ridiculous.

With that, I turned back toward the door.

And then—I felt it. Something was off. Different. An unease settled in my chest as I stepped back to the window for another look. It was my house—but it didn’t feel like it.

Empty.

The warmth of home, the familiar mess of everyday life—gone. The Chinese cutlery we used every day in the living room? Missing. The carpet? Filthy, covered in dust, as if no one had stepped on it in years. The wallpaper? Ripped apart, gaping tears running across it like open wounds.

Everything was wrong. Everything felt very, very wrong. And just then—my phone rang.

A familiar number. Dr. Sameer.

I knew him. Why was he calling me now?

I picked up. "Hello?"

A pause. Then, his voice, calm yet heavy with something I couldn’t place.

"Did you see the change?"

My breath hitched.

"I told you."

A chill crawled down my spine.

"Everything has changed. Your life... is based on a lie."

I disconnected the call. My fingers felt numb.

Turning toward the door, I unlocked it, hesitated for just a second, then stepped inside.

Silence.

The air was heavy—stale, almost suffocating. The warmth, the love, the familiar aura that filled this space just this morning—gone.

It felt… abandoned.

Dust clung to every surface. The floor, untouched for weeks. The bed—it reeked. The sofa carried a stench so foul I almost gagged.

I moved toward the refrigerator, pulling it open. Empty. Not a single grocery item. No milk cartons, no leftovers, no signs of life.

And the lights—dead. No electricity.

This wasn’t my home.

Or rather—it was, but it shouldn’t be.

I called my mother, but she didn’t answer. I tried again, pressing the phone tighter against my ear as if that would somehow force a response. Silence. A hollow, heavy kind of silence that made my stomach turn. I glanced around the house—no electricity, no warmth, no life. The walls that once carried laughter now felt like they were caving in. And then came the knock. A sharp, deliberate knock at the door. I turned, my pulse quickening, and there he was—Doctor Sameer. Standing in my doorway, calm, expectant, as if he had every right to be there. A chill ran through me, a deep, unsettling cold that settled in my bones. My hands curled into fists before I even realized it.

"Why are you here?" I demanded, my voice uneven. "Who are you? How do I know you?" The certainty that I did know him gnawed at my mind, a maddening itch just out of reach. His presence was familiar, yet wrong, like a misplaced memory I couldn’t grasp. My breath came shorter. My chest tightened. The room blurred at the edges. The last thing I saw before everything went black was his face—watching me, unshaken, as I collapsed on to the floor.

Same day, Late night.

I woke up two hours later, my head pounding, my thoughts a tangled mess. The weight in my chest hadn't eased—it had only settled deeper, like a parasite feeding off my sanity. I knew then, with unsettling clarity, that something was wrong with me. The room smelled of dust and neglect, yet I was in our bedroom. The familiarity of it only made the unease worse. And then, I saw him—the stranger. No, not a stranger. Doctor Sameer. He sat beside me, calm as ever, watching, waiting.

"How are you feeling?" he asked. His voice was even, measured, like he already knew the answer.

I wanted to say the truth. I'm losing my mind. Nothing makes sense. My home isn't my home. My life feels like a fabrication. But the words wouldn't come. My instincts took over instead. "I'm fine," I lied.

And then, the door creaked open. My mother stepped in first, her face lined with worry, followed closely by my father. Behind them, a few of my friends lingered in the doorway, their expressions unreadable. The sight of them should have been reassuring, should have grounded me. Instead, it only deepened the dread crawling under my skin.

I sat there, staring at them, waiting for someone to say something that would make sense. My mother looked at my father, her hands trembling. My friends shifted uncomfortably. And then, Doctor Sameer spoke.

“The last five years… they weren’t real.”

The words didn’t hit me at first. They hung in the air like smoke, twisting, waiting to settle. “It was all fine until 2020,” he continued, carefully choosing his words. “But after that… things changed.”

My heart pounded against my ribs. I wanted to speak, to ask what the hell he meant, but my throat closed up. My mother finally stepped forward, her voice barely above a whisper. “You lost them.”

Everything in me went still. 

Have you ever felt like you were falling—deep, endless, into a black void—while your body remained in the same place? Like time didn’t move, yet everything around you had changed? You know you’re in the present, trapped in this unbearable now, but you don’t want to be here. The past, even if it was a lie, felt warmer, softer. It wrapped around you like a memory you could still touch. Even knowing it wasn’t real… it was better than this.

I felt it. Yes, I did. 

“The pandemic… they got sick.” She swallowed hard, struggling to say it. “You all did. But you— you survived.”

No.

My head shook before I even realized it. No, that’s not true. That’s not true.

“You couldn’t bear it,” she continued, tears slipping down her face. “You… forgot. You built a life where they never left.”

The world around me shrank. My breath came in ragged gasps. No. No, I just saw them. My wife, my kids. We had breakfast. We laughed. I picked up my daughter’s toys this morning. I kissed my son’s forehead before leaving for work. I was just with them.

But I wasn’t.

The truth crashed into me like a hole in heart, like a wave, drowning me in its weight. The empty house. The dust. The missing warmth. The silence. It had always been silent.

I clutched my head, squeezing my eyes shut, trying to fight it, trying to hold on to what I knew—what I thought I knew. But the memories were slipping, breaking apart like shattered glass.

I had been living a lie.

Moments later, the room echoed with a single, deafening blast. The gun kicked back in my hand, the sharp scent of gunpowder filling the air. The bullet tore through flesh and bone, carving its path deep into my mind—erasing the unbearable truth, silencing the agony that had swallowed me whole.

No more lies. No more pain. No more empty home where laughter once lived.

Just darkness. Just silence. Just gone.

And now, there was nothing left.
The bullet tore through, carrying with it the truth I refused to live with, ripping away the reality etched in my mind—that they were gone. It left my brain vacant, hollow, free of the unbearable weight of knowing. I didn’t want this truth. Not if it meant a life where they didn’t exist. Not if it meant this was all that remained.

Farewell.
