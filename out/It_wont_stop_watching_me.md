I need advice, my friends and family don’t believe me, so I turned to fellow reddit users for advice, so help me.

A couple months ago, I (M 25) was going to sleep when I noticed something in my closet out of the corner of my eye (it was cracked open a bit). I wondered to myself what it was. Ofc me being the curious me I am, after a bit of going back and forth of if I should open the closet door, I decided to open it. When I opened it, a terrifying sight lay upon me. 

A tall figure, probably about 6’8-7’0 with skin that was just hanging on to the bone, kind of like drapes, and jagged teeth with blood curdling red eyes stood there, slouched. I stood there, in shock and terrified. I should have ran, I know, so don’t come after me. What I did next was close the closet door, and try to go back to sleep.

Next morning, I got up and acted like everything was normal. I thought I was just tired and was hallucinating it, or maybe it was just a dream. Sadly this was not the case. I saw the same figure at my workplace peering at me from the janitors closet. I asked one of my near by co-workers if they could see it. They couldn’t, is it a possibility that only I can see it? I pretended I didn’t see it, got on with my day, and acted like it was normal.

When I got home, I got a text message from my brother. He wanted to meet me at a nearby restaurant for dinner, I agreed and we met up. Everything was normal until I got up to use the bathroom. After I did my business, when I was washing my hands, I saw those same gruesome eyes staring at me through one of the stall doors. I decided to go to the stall door and open it, maybe I was seeing things and it wasn’t there? Nope. There the thing was, staring at me. Drool dripping from its mouth.

I hurried out of the bathroom, told my brother I had to go, payed, and left. When I got home, I went straight to my closet door and taped it shut with duck tape. I tried going to sleep, which I did, but I woke up in the middle of the night and saw those eyes staring at me, but not from the closet, in the corner of my room this time. So no matter what, this thing will find a way to watch me?

This has happened every night since then. What should I do?

UPDATE:i decided to research a bit and found some promising news out. This has happened before, to this dude who lives in New York  (I live in michigan) so it’s a long drive, but I have talked to him a little and he agreed to meet up with me but in one condition which is I have to be the one driving out there to oklahoma, should I do it?
