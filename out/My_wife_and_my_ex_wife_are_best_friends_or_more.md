Recently me (35 years) and my wife (33years) have been getting in a lot of fights and arguments over stupid things. Like who left the milk out or who didn’t close the door before going to bed. 
Since a few months back my wife got pregnant, she is 5 months pregnant. And ever since she has been arguing with me that I never contribute with anything in this household. Even though it’s me who has the job while she is a home-wife. -Of course I know it’s hard to do everything in the household like cooking, cleaning and doing everyone’s laundry. Though the thing is, she has never really done those things. Even before she got pregnant she usually slopped around at home while I was at work and when I came home it was just as messy, no laundry done, no cooked food and she was just in the couch acting exhausted. My wife wasn’t supposed to be a home-wife. She lost her job during covid and haven’t even bothered to look for a new one. Her last one was rather good paying meaning that we could usually take a few days off and just stay home and spend time with each other. Now when it’s only me working I usually have to stay at work late.


Just a few weeks ago I came home after a night shift. When I stepped in to the living room I saw my wife and my ex wife who I had ended on good terms with. We we’re young and didn’t know better so we got married. It only lasted a year and a half before we decided the part ways.
I was shocked when I saw what they we’re doing though. They each had a glass of red wine that they were sipping on. Several empty bottles stood on the coffee table. My wife and my ex wife sat really close, holding their hands on each other’s thighs and resting their heads in one another’s neck.
“What are you doing?!” I almost shouted when I saw them back. Over and over again I asked why she had been hanging out with my ex wife and how long she had been doing it. My wife just rolled her eyes and continued complaining about how bad of a husband I was. My ex wife gave me a sorry look before she looked back at my wife.

The next day when I came home from work my wife was no where to be seen. The empty wine bottles from the other day still stood there together with half eaten chocolate bars and chip bags.
I walked into the kitchen to find a note from my wife.
-Me and (ex wifes name) are out on a road trip. See you in a few days.
I tried calling her multiple times before I gave up and cooked some food for myself since yet again she hadn’t done anything in the house. I decided to clean up after her mess.

She was back a few days later with a ticket from the cops for speeding. She begged me to pay her ticket.
I reminded her on how much I had been doing recently, especially the things she was supposed to be doing.
She threw a tantrum and said that she had no job and that I was her only hope. I snorted.
“What about my ex wife that you’re on such good terms with.” I snapped. “What about her?” She as,ed confused.
We didn’t speak to each other for the rest of that day.

A week ago I came home to my wife, a man and my ex wife sitting in the couch, masturbating.
She freaked out at once getting up and pulling away the mans hand who was moving in and out of her cl1t.
I felt betrayed when I saw what they we’re doing.
The man and my ex wife instantly left. The man begging for forgiveness saying that my wife said she was single. They had apparently met at the bar and she had invited her home after making out in the launch at the bar. He gave me his number just in case I wanted to hear the entire story. My ex wife looked ashamed. She mumbled an apology before leaving.

I told my wife we we’re over and that I was going to be taking everything. She broke into tears. “But since I am tour wife I will be getting half of it.” She cried. This made me laugh out loudly. “No, since you said we didn’t have to sign that kind of paper. Thanks to you I’ll take whats mine, everything.” I called a lawyer that same day asking for help with my divorce. I told him the entire story and he instantly took my side.

The last thing  I  said to her was ‘I’ll see you at the birth of my child, or is it someone else’s?’
I haven’t answered any messages from her but from her family which I said told everything. They said they supported my actions and we’re here for me if I ever needed it.

I have seen her messages when they have been popping up on my phone though. Telling me that I am an asshole for involving her family and for leaving like that. She has even sent me nudes and pictures of her sleeping with other men as some kind of revenge.
I will not be surprised if a reddit post from her pops up on my feed saying that I am the problem.

I’m just wondering if I should’ve  listened to her or payed her ticket. I don’t regret anything yet at least. 
These thoughts have been keeping me awake at night.
