The classified ad was wedged between "Experienced CPA Needed" and "Tax Preparation - Seasonal." I'd been staring at job listings for three hours, my coffee had gone cold twice, and my landlord's third notice sat on the corner of my kitchen table like a small red guillotine.

"Accounts Receivable Specialist. Unique clientele. Must be detail-oriented, discreet, and comfortable with irregular hours. Accounting background required. Excellent compensation. No agencies."

The phone number had too many digits.

I counted them twice, the way I count everything. Twelve numbers instead of ten. I checked the listing again online—same number. A typo, probably. Some old immigrant business owner who'd listed their international number by mistake. I'd seen stranger things in six years of public accounting. Not much stranger, but some.

I called it anyway. At that point, I had \$847 in my checking account, \$23,000 in student loans, and a master's degree that had proven remarkably effective at qualifying me for jobs that no longer existed. The recession had gutted the accounting market. The firms were hiring, sure—they were hiring people with five years of experience for entry-level wages, and they were hiring fresh graduates for unpaid internships that might, possibly, if you were very lucky and very good, turn into a \$35,000 position in eighteen months.

I was neither fresh nor experienced enough. I was in the valley between, where careers go to die.

The phone rang once. Not the normal ring—something older, like a rotary phone, or a bell in an empty church.

"You're calling about the position." It wasn't a question. The voice was male, ageless, and had an accent I couldn't place. Not quite British, not quite anything else. The kind of accent that suggested English was a language he'd learned before it had fully formed.

"Yes," I said. "The accounts receivable position. I have a master's in accounting from—"

"I know what you have, Ms. Chen. I know what you owe. I know what you're worth." He paused. "The question is whether you know."

I should have hung up. That's what I tell myself now, in the moments before sleep, when I replay that conversation and imagine making different choices. I should have recognized the wrongness in his voice, the impossible knowledge, the threat wrapped in courtesy.

Instead, I said: "I'm worth hiring. I'm detail-oriented, I'm thorough, and I don't quit until the numbers balance."

"No," he said. "You don't, do you? That's why you're still looking at the Pemberton file."

My blood went cold. The Pemberton file was sitting on my desk—a freelance job I'd taken on, a small business audit that had revealed systematic fraud. I'd been staring at it for weeks, trying to decide whether to report it or let it go. The client was a family business. Reporting them would destroy three generations of work. Not reporting them would make me complicit.

"How do you—"

"I know many things, Ms. Chen. I know you'll report them, because you believe in the integrity of numbers. I know you'll do it even though they'll never pay your invoice. I know you're exactly the kind of person I need." Another pause. "Come to the address I'm about to give you. Tomorrow, 9 PM. Bring your resume, though I won't read it. Bring your questions, though I may not answer them. Bring your integrity, because that's the only thing I'm actually hiring."

He gave me an address in the old financial district, in a building I'd walked past a hundred times. Then he hung up.

I sat there for a long moment, phone still pressed to my ear, listening to the silence. Then I did what any good accountant would do: I made a list of reasons not to go, and a list of reasons to go.

The "not to go" list was longer. It included items like "obvious scam," "possible human trafficking," "definitely a cult," and "that thing about knowing about Pemberton is really fucking creepy."

The "to go" list had one item: "\$847."

I went.


The building was older than I'd thought. In daylight, it looked like every other converted warehouse in the financial district—red brick, tall windows, the kind of place that now housed tech startups and artisanal coffee shops. At night, it looked like something that had been waiting.

The address led me to a door I'd never noticed before, tucked into an alcove between two storefronts. Black wood, no number, no sign. Just a brass knocker shaped like a hand holding a scale.

I knocked.

The door opened immediately, as if someone had been standing on the other side, waiting. But there was no one there. Just a long hallway, lit by lights that seemed to come from nowhere in particular, and at the end, an open door spilling warm yellow light.

"Ms. Chen." The voice from the phone, coming from the lit doorway. "Please. Come in."

I'd like to say I hesitated. I'd like to say some survival instinct kicked in, some primal recognition of danger. But the truth is, I was thinking about my landlord's notice. I was thinking about the Pemberton file, and how he'd known about it. I was thinking about how someone who knew that much about me might actually have a real job to offer.

I walked down the hallway.

The office was wrong in ways I couldn't immediately articulate. The dimensions seemed off—too deep for the building's width, too tall for its height. The walls were lined with filing cabinets that looked like they'd been made before filing cabinets were invented, all dark wood and brass fittings and locks that required actual keys. A desk dominated the center of the room, and behind it sat a man who looked like he'd been middle-aged for several centuries.

He was handsome in an unsettling way, like a painting of a handsome man rather than the real thing. His suit was perfect—too perfect, the kind of perfect that comes from being made by someone who understands the Platonic ideal of a suit. His eyes were dark and deep and looked at me like I was a column of numbers that didn't quite add up.

"Sit," he said, gesturing to a chair that I was certain hadn't been there a moment ago.

I sat.

"My name is Ashmedai," he said. "I've been collecting debts for a very long time. I'm looking for an assistant."

"Collecting debts from whom?"

"From those who owe them." He smiled slightly. "I appreciate your directness, Ms. Chen. Most people spend the first ten minutes of this interview asking irrelevant questions about salary and benefits. You want to know about the work."

"I want to know if it's legal."

"It's older than legal," he said. "But yes, in the sense you mean, it's legal. I collect debts that are legitimately owed, from entities that legitimately owe them, using methods that are... mostly legitimate."

"Entities?"

"People. Businesses. Other things." He leaned back in his chair. "I'm going to be honest with you, Ms. Chen, because I think you'll appreciate honesty more than salesmanship. The work is dangerous. The clients are difficult. The debtors are often hostile. You'll work irregular hours in irregular places, and you'll see things that will make you question your understanding of reality."

"And the pay?"

"Enough to clear your student loans in six months. Enough to never worry about rent again. Enough to make you wonder why anyone does anything else." He paused. "But money isn't why you'll take this job."

"No?"

"No. You'll take it because you're curious. Because you've spent your entire life making other people's numbers add up, and you want to know what happens when the numbers don't add up. When the ledger shows debts that shouldn't exist, owed by things that shouldn't exist, for prices that can't be paid in any currency you've ever heard of." He leaned forward. "You'll take it because you're tired of the small frauds and the small lies, and you want to see what the big ones look like."

He was right, and I hated that he was right.

"What would I actually be doing?"

Ashmedai reached into a drawer and pulled out a book. Not a ledger—I'd seen plenty of ledgers. This was something else. The cover was leather, but not any leather I recognized. The pages were thick and irregular, like vellum, and the writing inside seemed to shift and change as I looked at it.

"This," he said, "is the Ledger. Capital L. It contains every debt owed to me, by every entity that has ever made a deal and failed to pay. Your job would be to collect those debts."

"How?"

"That depends on the debt. Some can be collected in cash. Some require... other considerations. You'll learn as you go." He turned the book toward me. "Look at the first entry."

I looked.

The page was covered in writing that seemed to be in multiple languages at once. But as I focused on it, the words resolved into English, like my eyes were translating automatically:

*DEBTOR: Markov, Yevgeny*  
*DEBT INCURRED: April 3, 1847*  
*TERMS: Seven years of prosperity in exchange for the firstborn child of his line*  
*PAYMENT DUE: April 3, 1854*  
*STATUS: Outstanding*  
*CURRENT BALANCE: One (1) firstborn child, plus interest*  
*INTEREST RATE: Compounding, generational*  
*CURRENT AMOUNT OWED: Seventeen (17) souls, or equivalent value*

I looked up at Ashmedai. "This is a joke."

"No."

"This is insane."

"No."

"This is—" I stopped. "1847?"

"I told you I've been collecting debts for a very long time."

"And you expect me to collect... seventeen souls?"

"I expect you to collect what's owed. How you collect it is up to you. That's why I need someone with an accounting background. Someone who understands that debts can be restructured, that payment plans can be negotiated, that sometimes you have to write off a loss." He smiled again, and this time there was something sharp in it. "And someone who understands that sometimes, you have to send in the collectors."

I should have left. I should have walked out of that office, out of that building, out of that entire situation. Instead, I heard myself say: "What's the starting salary?"

"Twelve thousand a month, plus commission on successful collections. Full benefits. Flexible hours. And most importantly—" He reached into another drawer and pulled out a small card. "—protection."

The card was black, with silver writing that seemed to glow slightly in the dim light. It read: *Bearer is under the protection of Ashmedai, Collector of Debts. Interference will be considered a hostile act.*

"Protection from what?"

"From the things you'll be collecting from." He slid the card across the desk. "Take it. Consider it a signing bonus. If you decide not to take the job, keep it anyway. You'll need it."

I picked up the card. It was warm, like it had been sitting in sunlight. The moment my fingers touched it, I felt something—a subtle shift, like the air pressure had changed, or like I'd stepped from one room into another without moving.

"I'll need to think about it," I said.

"Of course. You have until midnight tomorrow. After that, the position will be filled by someone else." He stood, and I realized the interview was over. "One more thing, Ms. Chen. If you take this job, you'll learn things about the world that you can't unlearn. You'll see things that will change how you understand reality. You can't go back to your old life, not really. The numbers will never look the same."

"Is that a threat?"

"It's a warning. There's a difference."

I left the office, walked down the impossible hallway, and stepped out into the night. The door closed behind me with a sound like a book slamming shut.

I went home. I made a list.

At 11:47 PM the next night, I called the number with too many digits.

"I'll take the job," I said.

"I know," said Ashmedai. "Come in tomorrow. We'll start with something simple."


"Simple" turned out to be a vampire who owed three months' rent on a crypt in Colma.

"Vampires," I said, staring at the Ledger entry, "are real."

"Obviously," said Ashmedai. He was showing me how to read the Ledger, how to interpret the entries, how to calculate interest on debts that had been outstanding for decades or centuries. "Though I should clarify—when I say vampire, I don't mean the romantic nonsense you've seen in movies. I mean a revenant. A corpse animated by residual life force, sustained by blood consumption, legally dead but functionally animate."

"Legally dead?"

"There are laws, Ms. Chen. Very old laws, but laws nonetheless. The supernatural world has its own legal system, its own courts, its own contracts. This vampire—his name is Kristoff—signed a lease agreement in 1987. He's been paying regularly until three months ago. Now he's behind, and the crypt's owner wants him out."

"Can't the owner just... evict him?"

"The owner is a lich. Liches are notoriously bad at confrontation. That's why he hired me. And that's why I'm sending you."

"Me? Alone?"

"You have the card. You have the Ledger. You have the authority of my office." Ashmedai looked at me over his reading glasses. "And you have a brain, which is more than most collectors have. Use it."

He gave me an address in Colma, the city of cemeteries south of San Francisco. He gave me a copy of the lease agreement, which looked like a normal rental contract except for the clauses about "no subletting to ghouls" and "tenant responsible for all blood stains." He gave me a briefcase containing three months' worth of rent receipts, a calculator, and a wooden stake.

"Just in case," he said, about the stake.

"I thought you said I had protection."

"You do. But protection doesn't mean invincibility. It means that if something kills you, I'll know who did it, and I'll make them regret it. Thoroughly. Eternally." He smiled. "Try not to die on your first collection. It's bad for morale."

I drove to Colma at sunset, because Ashmedai had said that was the best time to catch a vampire at home. The cemetery was old and sprawling, full of elaborate mausoleums and simple headstones, and the crypt I was looking for was in the back corner, behind a stand of cypress trees that looked like they'd been planted specifically to create ominous shadows.

The crypt was small, just a stone box with a door, really. The door had a mailbox. The mailbox was overflowing with past-due notices.

I knocked.

Nothing.

I knocked again, louder. "Mr. Kristoff? My name is Alice Chen. I'm here on behalf of Ashmedai, Collector of Debts. I need to speak with you about your outstanding rent."

Still nothing.

I tried the door. It was unlocked.

The inside of the crypt was larger than the outside, which should have been impossible but which I was starting to accept as normal. It was decorated like a studio apartment, if studio apartments were underground and smelled like old blood and older earth. There was a coffin in the corner, lid open, empty. There was a kitchenette with a mini-fridge that I really didn't want to look inside. There was a desk covered in papers and a laptop that was playing what sounded like a true crime podcast.

And there was a vampire, sitting in an armchair, staring at me with eyes that reflected light like a cat's.

"You're not from the management company," he said. His voice was accented—Russian, maybe, or somewhere near there. He looked young, maybe thirty, but his eyes were older. Much older.

"No," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "I'm from Ashmedai's office. You're three months behind on rent. I'm here to collect."

"Ashmedai." Kristoff said the name like it tasted bad. "Of course. The lich finally called in the big guns."

"I'm not a big gun. I'm an accountant."

"Even worse." He stood up, and I realized he was tall. Very tall. And thin in a way that suggested he hadn't been eating regularly. "I don't have the money."

"Then we need to discuss a payment plan."

"I don't have the money," he repeated, "because I don't have a job. I lost my job. I lost my job because my employer found out what I am, and he fired me, and now I can't get another job because I can't go out during the day, and all the night shift positions want references, and I can't give references because my last employer tried to stake me in the parking lot."

I blinked. "That's... wrongful termination. You could sue."

"I'm legally dead. I can't sue anyone."

He had a point. I pulled out my briefcase, opened it, and took out the calculator and the lease agreement. "Okay. Let's look at your situation. You owe three months' rent at \$800 a month, plus late fees of \$50 per month, plus interest at 5% annually. That's \$2,550 total."

"I know how much I owe. I'm not stupid. I'm just broke."

"Do you have any assets?"

"I have a coffin and a mini-fridge full of blood bags that I stole from a hospital."

"That's theft."

"I'm a vampire. Theft is literally the least of my crimes."

I sat down in the other chair, uninvited. Kristoff looked surprised, but he sat back down too. I pulled out a notepad and started writing.

"Okay," I said. "Here's what we're going to do. You're going to get a job. I don't care what kind of job. Night security, graveyard shift at a warehouse, whatever. You're going to start paying your rent again, and you're going to pay down your arrears at \$100 a month until the debt is clear. That gives you twenty-six months to get current."

"And if I don't?"

"Then I come back with the stake."

He laughed. It wasn't a nice laugh. "You? You're going to stake me?"

"No," I said. "I'm going to report you to Ashmedai, and he's going to send someone who will. But I'd rather not do that, because I'm an accountant, not a killer, and I'd prefer to resolve this with a payment plan rather than violence."

Kristoff stared at me for a long moment. Then he said: "You're serious."

"I'm always serious about debt collection."

"You're insane."

"I'm practical. There's a difference." I tore off the top sheet of my notepad and handed it to him. "Here's the payment plan. Sign it, and we're done. Don't sign it, and I escalate this to my supervisor."

He took the paper. He read it. He looked at me like I was something he'd never seen before.

"You really think I'm going to pay this?"

"I think you're going to try. And if you try, I can work with you. If you don't try, I can't." I stood up. "I'll be back in one month to collect the first payment. $900—$800 for current rent, \$100 for arrears. If you don't have it, we'll renegotiate. If you're not here, I'll find you."

I walked to the door. I was almost out when he said: "Wait."

I turned.

"Why are you doing this? Why not just... you know. Stake me and be done with it?"

"Because you owe rent, not your life. And because debt collection is about getting paid, not about punishment." I paused. "Also, because I looked at your lease agreement, and your landlord is charging you \$800 a month for a crypt with no windows, no bathroom, and no heating. That's price gouging, even for the supernatural real estate market. You're being exploited, and I don't like that."

Kristoff stared at me. Then, slowly, he smiled. His fangs were very white.

"You're definitely insane," he said. "But okay. I'll try."

"Good enough."

I left the crypt, walked back to my car, and sat in the driver's seat for a full five minutes, shaking. Then I drove back to the office and told Ashmedai that I'd successfully negotiated a payment plan.

He looked surprised. "You didn't stake him?"

"He's not hostile. He's just broke. There's a difference."

"Interesting." Ashmedai made a note in the Ledger. "Very interesting. Most collectors would have just eliminated the problem."

"I'm not most collectors. I'm an accountant."

"Yes," said Ashmedai, and his smile was approving. "You are."


The second collection was harder.

The debtor was a witch named Millicent Graves, and she owed Ashmedai for a spell he'd provided in 1973. The spell had been a love charm, guaranteed to make her husband faithful. It had worked. It had worked so well that her husband had become obsessed with her, unable to think of anything else, unable to work or sleep or function without her presence. He'd died of exhaustion six months later, still smiling, still whispering her name.

The payment had been due in 1974. It was now fifty years overdue.

"What did she owe?" I asked, looking at the Ledger entry.

"Her firstborn child."

I looked up at Ashmedai. "You can't be serious."

"I'm always serious about contracts, Ms. Chen. She agreed to the terms. She signed the contract. She received the service. Now she owes the payment."

"She can't just... give you a child."

"No. But she can give me the equivalent value. A life for a life. A soul for a soul. Or—" He tapped the Ledger. "—she can negotiate an alternative payment. That's why I'm sending you."

Millicent Graves lived in a Victorian house in the Haight, the kind of house that looked like it had been decorated by someone who'd read too many books about witchcraft and not enough books about interior design. There were crystals in every window, herbs hanging from every doorway, and a cat that watched me from the porch with eyes that were definitely too intelligent.

I knocked.

The door opened immediately. The woman standing there was old—not elderly, but old in a way that suggested she'd been middle-aged for several decades and had decided to stay that way. She was wearing a purple dress and too much jewelry, and she smelled like incense and something darker.

"I know why you're here," she said. "Come in."

The inside of the house was worse than the outside. Every surface was covered with magical paraphernalia—candles, bones, jars of things I didn't want to identify. The air was thick with smoke and the feeling of being watched by invisible eyes.

"Tea?" she asked.

"No, thank you."

"Smart girl." She sat down in a chair that looked like it was made of twisted roots. "You're here about the debt."

"Yes."

"I'm not paying it."

I pulled out the Ledger copy and my notepad. "Ms. Graves, you signed a contract. You received services. The payment is due."

"The payment was my firstborn child. I never had children. Therefore, I can't pay."

"The contract specifies 'firstborn child or equivalent value.' You can negotiate an alternative payment."

"I'm not negotiating anything. That bastard killed my husband."

"The spell killed your husband. You requested the spell. You knew the risks."

"I didn't know it would—" She stopped. Her hands were shaking. "I didn't know it would do that. I just wanted him to stop cheating. I just wanted him to love me."

And there it was. The human element. The reason behind the numbers. The thing that made this more than just a debt collection.

I sat down, uninvited, in the chair across from her.

"Tell me about your husband," I said.

She looked surprised. Then, slowly, she started talking.

His name had been Robert. He'd been a musician, charming and handsome and completely unable to stay faithful. She'd loved him desperately, the way you love someone who's slowly destroying you. She'd tried everything—therapy, ultimatums, prayer. Nothing had worked. So she'd gone to Ashmedai, and she'd made a deal.

"I thought it would just make him faithful," she said. "I thought he'd just... stop cheating. I didn't think it would consume him. I didn't think it would kill him."

"Did you read the contract?"

"Of course I read it. I'm not stupid."

"Then you knew the risks."

"Knowing and understanding are different things." She looked at me with eyes that were wet but not crying. "You're young. You don't understand yet. But you will. You'll make a choice that seems reasonable, that seems like the only option, and it will destroy everything you love. And then someone like you will show up at your door and tell you that you owe a debt."

I thought about my student loans. I thought about the Pemberton file. I thought about the choice I'd made to take this job, and what it might cost me.

"I understand more than you think," I said. "But understanding doesn't erase the debt. You still owe payment."

"I don't have a child to give you."

"Then give me something else. Something of equivalent value."

"Like what?"

I looked around the room, at all the magical items, all the accumulated power. "You're a witch. You have knowledge. You have skills. You have connections in the supernatural world. That has value."

"You want me to work for Ashmedai?"

"I want you to pay your debt. How you pay it is up to you."

She was quiet for a long time. Then she said: "I could teach you."

"Teach me what?"

"Magic. Protection spells. Warding. The things you'll need to know if you're going to keep doing this job." She leaned forward. "You're walking into dangerous places, collecting debts from dangerous things. That card Ashmedai gave you will only protect you so far. You need to know how to protect yourself."

I thought about it. It made sense. And it would give Millicent a way to pay her debt without destroying her life further.

"How long would the teaching take?"

"A year. One lesson a week. By the end, you'll know enough to keep yourself alive."

"And that would clear your debt?"

"That would clear my debt."

I did the math in my head. Fifty-two lessons, at what—\$500 per lesson? That was \$26,000 worth of value, which was roughly equivalent to the value of a soul in the current supernatural market, according to the notes Ashmedai had given me.

"Deal," I said. "I'll draw up the paperwork."

I left Millicent's house with a contract for magical lessons and a growing sense that I was in way over my head. But the debt was being paid. The numbers balanced. That was what mattered.

That's what I told myself, anyway.


The third collection was the one that almost killed me.

The debtor was something called a Redcap, which Ashmedai explained was a type of fae creature that lived in old castles and murdered travelers, dyeing its cap red with their blood.

"There are no old castles in San Francisco," I said.

"There's an old fort. Close enough." Ashmedai showed me the Ledger entry. "This particular Redcap has been living in Fort Point for thirty years. He owes me for safe passage into this realm. He was supposed to pay in 1994. He didn't. Now the debt has compounded."

"What does he owe?"

"Seven years of service, or the equivalent in blood."

"Blood?"

"Fae debts are often paid in blood. It's their currency." Ashmedai looked at me seriously. "This one is dangerous, Ms. Chen. More dangerous than the vampire or the witch. Redcaps are killers by nature. They don't negotiate. They don't compromise. They kill, and they enjoy it."

"Then why are you sending me?"

"Because you need to learn that not every debt can be collected peacefully. Sometimes, you have to be willing to fight. Or to run." He handed me a small vial of something that glowed faintly green. "Iron water. Fae hate iron. If things go wrong, throw this at him and run. Don't try to fight. Don't try to negotiate. Just run."

I took the vial. It was cold, colder than it should have been.

"What if I can't outrun him?"

"Then I'll collect your debt from your estate, and I'll find a new assistant." He said it matter-of-factly, like he was discussing a budget shortfall. "Try not to die, Ms. Chen. You're the best assistant I've had in decades."

I drove to Fort Point at midnight, because Ashmedai said that was when the Redcap would be most active. The fort was a Civil War-era brick structure under the Golden Gate Bridge, all dark corridors and empty rooms and the sound of water dripping somewhere in the darkness.

I had a flashlight. I had the vial of iron water. I had the Ledger copy and my notepad and a pen that suddenly seemed like a very inadequate weapon.

I also had a growing sense that I'd made a terrible mistake.

The fort was empty. Not just empty—abandoned, like something had driven out all the life. No birds, no rats, no insects. Just silence and darkness and the smell of old blood.

I found the Redcap in the lowest level, in a room that had once been a powder magazine. He was small, maybe four feet tall, with a face like a withered apple and eyes like chips of black glass. He was wearing a cap that was so red it seemed to glow, and his hands were stained dark with old blood.

"Ashmedai's little accountant," he said. His voice was like rocks grinding together. "Come to collect the debt."

"Yes," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "You owe seven years of service, or the equivalent in blood. I'm here to negotiate a payment plan."

He laughed. It was not a nice sound.

"I don't negotiate with humans. I kill them. I take their blood. I dye my cap." He took a step toward me. "Your blood will do nicely."

I pulled out the vial of iron water. "Stay back. I'm under Ashmedai's protection."

"Ashmedai's protection means he'll avenge you. It doesn't mean he'll save you." Another step. "And I'm willing to pay that price. Your blood is worth seven years of service. Maybe more."

He lunged.

I threw the vial.

It shattered against his chest, and the iron water splashed across him like acid. He screamed—a sound that was more rage than pain—and stumbled back. His skin was smoking where the water had touched it, blistering and blackening.

I ran.

I ran through the dark corridors, my flashlight beam bouncing wildly, my breath coming in gasps. Behind me, I could hear the Redcap following, his footsteps quick and light, his laughter echoing off the brick walls.

I burst out of the fort and into the night air, and I kept running. Across the parking lot, toward my car, fumbling for my keys—

Something hit me from behind, and I went down hard. The Redcap was on top of me, his weight surprising for something so small, his hands around my throat. His cap was dripping, and I realized with horror that it was dripping fresh blood. My blood. He'd clawed my back when he'd tackled me.

"Your blood," he hissed. "Your blood for my cap."

I couldn't breathe. I couldn't think. I could only feel his hands tightening, and see his eyes, black and empty and hungry.

And then I remembered the card.

I pulled it out of my pocket with my left hand—my right was trying uselessly to pry his fingers from my throat—and I pressed it against his face.

The effect was immediate. The Redcap screamed and threw himself backward, away from me, away from the card. Where the card had touched his skin, there was a mark—a brand, glowing silver, in the shape of scales.

"Ashmedai's mark," he gasped. "You bear Ashmedai's mark."

"I told you," I wheezed, my throat aching. "I'm under his protection."

The Redcap stared at me with something that might have been fear. Then he said: "The debt. I'll pay the debt. Seven years of service. I'll pay it."

"Too late," I said. "You attacked me. You tried to kill me. The debt is now forfeit. Ashmedai will collect it himself."

"No. Please. I'll pay double. Triple. Anything."

"You should have thought of that before you tried to dye your cap with my blood."

I got to my feet, slowly, painfully. My back was bleeding, my throat was bruised, and I was pretty sure I was going into shock. But I was alive.

The Redcap was on his knees now, his red cap clutched in his hands. "Please. I'll serve you. Seven years. Fourteen years. Whatever you want."

I looked at him. I thought about mercy. I thought about second chances. I thought about all the things that made us human.

Then I thought about his hands around my throat, and his laughter in the darkness, and the way he'd said "your blood will do nicely."

"No," I said. "The debt is forfeit. Ashmedai will collect."

I got in my car and drove away. In the rearview mirror, I could see the Redcap, still kneeling, still clutching his cap, getting smaller and smaller until he disappeared.


Ashmedai was waiting for me when I got back to the office. He took one look at me—bloody, bruised, shaking—and nodded.

"You survived," he said. "Good."

"He tried to kill me."

"Yes. They do that sometimes." He gestured to a chair. "Sit. Let me see your back."

I sat. He examined the claw marks, then pulled out a small jar of something that smelled like herbs and copper. He spread it on the wounds, and the pain faded immediately, replaced by a cool tingling sensation.

"You did well," he said. "You used the iron water. You used the card. You survived, and you didn't compromise the debt. That's more than most collectors manage on their first dangerous collection."

"You knew he'd attack me."

"I suspected he might. That's why I gave you the iron water."

"You could have warned me."

"I did warn you. I told you he was dangerous. I told you to run if things went wrong." He finished applying the salve and stepped back. "But you needed to learn that some debts can't be collected peacefully. Some debtors will try to kill you rather than pay. You needed to know that, and you needed to know that you could survive it."

I wanted to be angry. I wanted to yell at him for sending me into danger without proper preparation. But he was right. I had needed to learn. And I had survived.

"What happens to the Redcap now?" I asked.

"I'll collect the debt myself. He'll serve me for seven years, and then he'll be free. Or he'll try to escape, and I'll hunt him down and collect a different kind of payment." Ashmedai smiled slightly. "Either way, the debt will be paid."

He walked back to his desk and opened the Ledger. "You've completed three collections in your first week. That's a record. Most assistants don't make it past the first one."

"What happened to them?"

"They quit. Or they died. Or they went mad." He looked up at me. "But you won't do any of those things, will you, Ms. Chen?"

"No," I said. And I meant it. Despite the danger, despite the fear, despite everything—I meant it. Because for the first time in my life, the numbers were adding up to something that mattered. The debts were real. The collections were real. The work was real.

And I was good at it.

"Good," said Ashmedai. "Because I have another collection for you. This one's in Oakland. A demon who owes child support."

"Demons have children?"

"Demons have everything humans have, just more of it. And worse." He handed me a new Ledger entry. "His name is Baalzephon. He owes seventeen years of child support, plus interest. The mother is a human woman who made a very poor choice at a very dark time in her life. She wants her money."

I took the entry. I read it. I calculated the total owed, including interest and penalties.

"This is going to be complicated," I said.

"Yes," said Ashmedai. "It is. But that's why I hired you. Because you don't run from complications. You solve them."

I looked at the Ledger entry, at the impossible debt, at the name of a demon who probably wanted to kill me as much as the Redcap had.

Then I pulled out my notepad and started making a list.

Because that's what accountants do. We make lists. We calculate totals. We balance the books.

Even when the books are bound in human skin and written in blood.

Even when the debts are owed by monsters.

Even when the collections might kill us.

We balance the books.

And I was very, very good at balancing books.
