My father used to tell me about the noises from the nearby woods, as casually as bar talk. 



He’d talk about ghosts within the walls of our home, the ectoplasm of some old-world monarch. 



He’d talk about a photographer from our town who captured a strange shadow, blacker than darkness itself—a man who spent the rest of his life locked in a cocoon of fear because he had touched the door beyond which there is only cold.



He’d talk about the sound of chains against flesh; the screams of young witches, drunk on fermented blood; of packs of wolves that walked upright, hunting like men. 



He made me appreciate the horror of the fantastic, and it became my greatest passion.



He never told me about the cancer that was slowly devouring his brain. He never told me about his fight, or the exhaustion. He told me about unreal monsters to hide his own.



My father always tried to shield me from reality, painting monsters over the rot of the real world. Now that he’s gone, I’m the one who has a story to tell. But unlike his, mine isn't a metaphor.



I wish it were a metaphor.



Things in town had been getting weird for months.



At first, we called them “pranks”—if you can call a rhythmic tapping on your bedroom window at three in the morning a prank. 



Then came the smells: the sharp, metallic stench of urine and waste left to rot in people’s flowerbeds.



Pets were the first to truly lose it. 



Dogs and cats, usually bold, would cower by the door, begging their owners to let them in before sundown, as if they knew the night no longer belonged to them. As if they knew something else was taking over their territories—something far too dangerous to fight.



And then there were the screams.



The locals tried to rationalize them—foxes, wolves, maybe even a stray bear. The town council even sent out a safety alert.



But we knew better. Those sounds weren't wild; they were guttural, vibrating through the air like someone with clogged vocal cords trying to imitate a beast. And yet, nobody wanted to believe that something inexplicable was hiding right there, in the heart of our woods.



The way this absurdity started, Dad, was bizarre even by your standards.



It began with a piece of news that hit every student's phone by second period—a viral spark that led us down a path toward something your darkest fables couldn't have conjured.



Most people held on to the idea of a tasteless prank gone on for far too long, but they were just lying to themselves.



The morning of the viral photo, our high school principal, Mr. Albert, chewed us all out in the auditorium: “Whoever is responsible for this charade needs to stop! This is not a joke: it is an obscene act! They found marks made with feces on poor Mrs. Williams’s house walls, and this is not acceptable for human beings! Those responsible will spend the next few weekends of their lives cleaning up the disgraceful spectacle they have created.” 



He went on to say that if the culprit didn't come forward, we'd all be dealing with the police.



“No human would do something like this,” I muttered, just loud enough for the guy next to me to hear. “The way the animals are acting... it should be obvious this isn’t just some prank by a bunch of students, you stupid bald idiot.”



“Please, don't start with the Wendigo–Skinwalker shit again,” Robby whispered back. “Animals in this town have always been weird. Just because my dog stares at you every time you sleep over doesn't mean he’s a shapeshifter waiting to rip your throat out.”



“And guess who’s at the top of my suspect list?” I shot back. “That demon of a Pomeranian of yours.”



“Yeah, right,” Robby laughed. “As if the sheer volume of shit on that wall didn't outweigh my little Charlie by at least twenty pounds. But seriously, what is that bald bastard picturing in his head? A bunch of guys huddling in a circle, emptying their bowels into a bucket just so they could spend their Saturday night repainting a damn wall with it?”



The whole school had seen the mark. Mrs. Williams was famous around here. 



She was an elderly lady who always smelled “new”—a scent recognizable from miles away, as if she was desperately trying to preserve what little youth she had left.



The kids called her “The Taxidermy,” insinuating she wasn't really alive, just a museum-style reproduction of a decaying human being.



“Still, I don't think anyone would actually mess with Mrs. Williams,” I said. Robby had this “for fun” theory: he thought someone slept with The Taxidermy, caught some weird disease, and was now getting revenge.



“I'd be more worried about the fact that someone willingly ended up in bed with her. That’s the horrific part. The shit on her walls seems almost harmless when you think about it" I said.



After lunch, Robby and I popped into the boys' bathroom.



We had a game where we looked at the state of the stalls and tried not to puke. At that point, the score was 68 wins for me, zero for him. We calculated the winner based on who could stare the longest at whatever spectacle our classmates’ assholes had offered up that day. 

 

 Robby had a weak stomach and every time you gagged, you lost points.

 

It was a weird, obscene game, but we were drawn to these unusual forms of entertainment. In a way, what we saw in there made the principal's accusations feel founded.



But that day, I took photos for comparison.



“James, we’ve been staring at that photo of literal shit dripping down the wall all morning! Don't you also have to... Oh, Christ!” Robby gagged, actually doubling over.



“Sixty-nine to zero, by the way,” I said, focusing on the brownish nightmare. “And since you actually vomited, I think you're at minus one."



My voice rose as I zoomed in on the photo and then back at the stall.  



“Look at the texture, Robby. Look at the color. Look at the tiny pieces of grass, fur, and bone. It’s animal shit—an omnivore, no doubt—but the more I look at the wall, the more deliberate it feels. Like an eerie attempt at writing from something with a brain, but no education.”



“You need to be put in a madhouse, far from everyone and everything,” Robby said, wiping his mouth.



I usually offered Robby a mint before class. I was self-conscious about my smell, my body—the mints were mainly to avoid being like the average guy in my class, who had a massive halitosis problem. Robby was no exception, but luckily for him, he had me.



“Guys, did you see the picture of the shit wall?” A voice pushed its way through the hallway chatter. 



Robby rolled his eyes. We knew exactly who it was.



“Yeah, Jeffrey. We saw it. We sure as hell saw it,” Robby said, stressing the obvious.



“The smell is... different,” Jeffrey whispered, leaning in far too close to our ears. Talking about halitosis…



“And what the hell does a photo have to do with the smell, Jeff?” Robby snapped, stepping back.



“There's something weird about it. It's the smell of a wild beast! George scraped some of it off. He’s sending it to his brother, who works for those internet DNA labs. It could be the key to the whole case…”



“And you think you're going to get a clean sequence by scraping shit off The Taxidermy’s siding and using one of those spit-in-a-cup kits that tell you you're 1% Mongolian?”



At that point, Robby had already sped up, heading for his desk. He couldn't stand Jeffrey, and he definitely couldn't stand George. They’d been friends years ago, but he blamed them for why he was at the bottom of the class. “



They rotted my brain during my most important period of development,” he always said.



But Jeffrey had sparked something in me. 



Since I didn't know anyone weird enough to do something like this, a faint hope had formed in my chest—a hope that something from the other side had finally materialized here, with us.



I sat next to Laura for that class. 



Most of my anxieties about how I presented myself originated with her. It wasn't just that she was beautiful; it was the way she existed. 



She made me feel a sort of genetic awe, as if I were looking at a superior branch of our species. 



Every time we spoke and she crossed into my personal space—maybe to give me a playful shove followed by a “you’re such an idiot!”—I’d feel this strange sensation. It was like the urgent need to pee, but without actually having to. Was this what they called love?



“Hey James, did you see the photo?” Laura asked as soon as I sat down.



“Yeah. Honestly, it’s pretty revolting just being friends with the guy who did it,” I said, throwing a stern look at Robby. 



Robby was my wingman—or more accurately, my punching bag. I hadn't found a faster or more effective way to make Laura laugh than using Robby as the butt of the joke.



“You’re such a freak,” she laughed. “I actually think you orchestrated the whole thing. You’re definitely weird enough to pull it off.”



“Hey, don’t insult my style. If it were me, I’d have left a secret message or some kind of code to see if anyone was smart enough to catch me. But whoever did this... I don’t think they had anything in mind at all. It feels mindless. Which is actually worse, don’t you think?”



“I’m dying to know more,” she whispered, leaning in. “My mom won’t even let me out of the house anymore because of all this stuff. She says the woods aren't safe.”



“Well, George and Jeffrey are ‘investigating,’” I joked, trying to mask my own growing obsession. “Maybe you should join their team?”



“Ugh, no thanks. I think I’m okay with living in a bit of healthy ignorance,” she laughed, turning her attention back to her notebook.



The lesson began, but my mind was elsewhere. I desperately wanted to invite her to the Taxidermy’s house. Maybe she would have appreciated the thrill of it. But for some reason, I couldn’t do it. I was terrified of rejection. Or worse, I was terrified that she wouldn't find my curiosity as exhilarating as I did.



I turned back to Robby.



“Let's go to The Taxidermy's,” I said. “She always offers you tea, anyway.”



“What the hell are you implying?”



“Nothing, nothing.”



“It's just because I remind her of her nephew,” he grumbled.



“Aren't you curious?” I pushed, trying to get him to agree. “Don't you want to know if she saw or heard anything? Do you really want Jeffrey and George rubbing it in our faces that they figured it out first?”



“Hell, no,” he huffed. “They're insufferable when they pretend to be something other than maggots.”



And so, at the sound of the final bell, we headed for Mrs. Williams’s house. That was the name we had to keep locked in our minds for the entire duration of the potential visit, to avoid repercussions and to train our brains to censor the word “Taxidermy.”



Mrs. Williams's villa was situated near the woods—a thirty-minute walk from the town center.



It was completely open, with no fences. The garden seemed like just another part of the overwhelming nature surrounding it.



There was this terrible feeling of isolation.



The house wasn't a vision of civilization, but rather an unnecessary element, almost alien compared to the boundless wilderness all around it. 



The orange and yellow of the exterior walls seemed to pulse.



The brown smears were still there. 



Looking at them up close, it didn't feel like a simple act of vandalism. They weren't recognizable shapes, but they had the frantic energy of a child's scribbles. Except that instead of watercolors, the artist had used the waste of its own body.



The certainty of that thought made me feel a surge of exaltation, even as my stomach turned with anxiety.



I was drawn to that small building, without any logic at all.



And the smell, my god. Jeffrey was right.



“God, don't let her mistake me for the nephew. Please don't let her mistake me for the nephew,” Robby muttered like a rosary, standing in front of Mrs. Williams's door—a door so large it must have been a special request when the house was built.



“It's just saliva, man,” I said.



“Then you let her kiss you, bastard!”



“You're the lookalike, not me.”



“Just knock on the fucking door!”



After I knocked, we waited a long time. Every passing second made Robby more agitated.



After I knocked, we waited. A long time. Every second that ticked by made Robby more twitchy, his eyes darting toward the tree line.



Then, we heard them. Footsteps. Distant at first, muffled by the internal walls, but the sound was deep—heavy. 



It felt as if whatever was walking back there was massive enough to fill the entire height of that enormous door. 



But the movements were clumsy, hesitant. Scared.



The rhythmic thuds shifted into a scuffing sound, a dragging weight against the wooden floor. 



It was shuffling toward us—an unstable creature, its gait weary, desperate, and terrified. 



It sounded like the movement of some desperate creature locked in a cage with water rising over his head.



And then, the air changed.



Our nostrils were assaulted by that wild, primal stench Jeffrey and George had described. A new presence was manifesting around us.



We were paralyzed.



The wild smell grew more intense, violating our senses, thick enough to taste.



Suddenly, everything stopped. Silence fell, heavy and absolute. Then, a hoarse voice whispered from the darkness of the keyhole:



“Police?”



It took a good five seconds before either of us could get our voices to work.



“Yes... No, no, I mean, we're not the police, Mrs. Williams.”



“Is my husband with you?”



That question was followed by a panicked look between Robby and me. “Your husband isn't here, no.”



It didn't feel like our responsibility to remind her that he was dead. But she clearly needed an anchor. Something had happened that had shaken her so badly that her old mind was forced to cling to some form of security, even a deceased one.



At that point, Robby—maybe moved by compassion for the situation—spoke up.



“Grandma? It's me.” He shifted to put his face right in front of the peephole. “This here is a friend of mine. We just came to visit you.”



I still find it hard to believe he said it. But he did, and with such conviction that it would have been impossible not to take the bait.



“Why are you here?!”



Robby froze. Mrs. Williams began to weep, a thin, rattling sound that seemed to come from her bones.



The smell was back, and now no longer just an odor; it was a physical weight, penetrating so deep into my lungs that I started to cough.



The wind whipped the branches around the property, a frantic gale that tried to scrub the air clean, but instead it only seemed to churn the stench, making it swell.



Then, the door creaked open. 



Both of our bodies recoiled, an instinctive, microscopic shift toward flight. 



But then her smell blocked us, inebriated us.



“You have to bring your grandfather here! Hurry!” 



The words were spat out by a face that looked like it had gone ten rounds with the Devil himself—gaunt, grey, and etched with a terror so pure it transcended age.



Robby’s facade crumbled the moment he saw her eyes. She lunged forward, her fingers clawing into his arm like talons.



“Mrs. Williams, please, calm down—”



“I don't feel safe in my own house,” she wailed, ignoring him. “I don't know where your grandad is. Please, find him!”



We stood there in a suffocating silence as she clung to Robby with her entire body. She began to press dry, seeking some kind of primal security from his male frame. 



Robby looked paralyzed, his face a mask of confusion and growing distress.



Then, the smell shifted another time.



It was coming from behind my shoulders now.



The wind brought the scent of something wild, something ancient. 



A cold shiver traced my spine.



I felt a stare from the darkness of the woods—a gaze that felt like a physical touch. 



The wind whispered a scent we couldn't decipher, but our bodies understood it perfectly. It made us feel weak. Submissive.



It made us feel like a pack of creatures about to challenge an alpha over territory.



Robby was still holding Mrs. Williams.



As I breathed in that smell—now as dense and cloying as a liquid—something in my body responded before my mind could reject it. That terrified me more than the smell.



The change wasn’t desire. It was synchronization.



My gaze lingered where it shouldn’t have, not because I wanted it to, but because my body had already decided that was necessary.



I looked at Robby and knew, without asking, that the same biological lie had taken hold of him. His posture had shifted. His breathing had changed.



Whatever was watching us from the woods wasn’t calling to our thoughts. It was enhancing our instincts.



And then Mrs. Williams’s cologne stopped being a smell.



It became a primordial signal.



Something ancient flared inside us—not desire, not thought, but tension. A pressure without a name. The kind that turns bodies into obstacles and instincts into violence.



Robby looked at me.



I looked back.



For a moment, we weren’t standing on a porch anymore.



We were two animals, locked in the same space, aware of each other in the way creatures are aware right before blood.



And neither of us stepped back.



While all this was happening, I felt my phone vibrate.



It was Jeffrey.



The voicemail started playing.



“You really need to hear this.



George’s brother called us back.



He said extracting a clean genetic profile from literal shit is basically impossible. He told us we were idiots and hung up.



Then he called again.



He said that, DNA aside, there were still things you could tell.



He said the diet was wrong. Omnivorous, but inconsistent. Too much undigested matter. Hair. Bone fragments.



He said the bacterial profile didn’t match a normal human gut. Too close to primates. Too far from us.



He said the hormone markers were… abnormal. Territorial. Aggressive. Like something marking space, not relieving itself.



He kept repeating the same thing.



‘It doesn’t look non-human,’ he said. ‘It looks like something human that’s stopped being one.’



Then he told us to stay the fuck away from where we picked it.



Interesting, right?”
