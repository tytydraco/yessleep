I had a nightmare last night. I was an old man with brittle bones under a dark sky that bled light through its wounds. Surrounded by a forest birthed from the same womb as the holes in the darkness. The trees whispered of a creature lurking, betraying its silence with each step. The night is cold and I can’t pull myself away from the fire in the clearing that cast shadows in the shape of what I once was. The creature is getting closer with each breath.

Pistol by my side crumbles to dust when I try to grasp it. Years of training, thousands of rounds shot to protect myself from this very moment useless. The fire’s light is fading, with every bush burned the creature finds a way to move closer. The crackling of the fires drowned out by the footsteps of a beast with no features, only a darkness.

Douglas firs cling to earth unfazed by the monster that circles. I reach into my pockets to find a relic of my past, a cold metallic rectangle that represents an ancient pact made between man and the natural world. I become a spell caster and ignite a dancer, a rebellion against the void that hisses at the beast. 

I attempt to shred a piece of cloth from my shirt to wrap around the last branch within reach. The dancer leaps from the palm of my hand onto the stick that now is a guide out of this darkness. I stand then collapse from my own weight. Thousands of miles walked with ease meant nothing if I can’t take another step in this moment.

A burst of wind drowns the fire, the shadow moves nearer. My body is frozen but my mind continues to run as far away as possible. It never makes it too far before I drag it back in. It was never clear to me who was really in charge here until this moment. The mind became nothing more than a fragile old man who hinges on dying breaths to escape the cold darkness. There was no point fighting it anymore.

The darkness takes seat beside me on an old fallen log that welcomed its presence as if a distant relative. I see no shape or figure but still manage to be fully aware of what I’m facing. A great mystery still remains about what might happen next.

There’s no hesitation, no wisdom offered, no hard fought battle. The darkness wraps itself around me and the world I knew fades to black. I’m left with nothing but my thoughts. Memories of a world I once knew.

I can see the thread of my life woven into the fabric of nature. I can never truly find the start or end to the string that the universe pretended to be at one point. Even the elite technicians of my planet would be baffled by the wiring of this system. Absolutely nothing made sense yet everything functioned beyond the realm of knowing. How can system function if we have yet to confirm its existence? How can a system have order without a need to express its desire?

No man offered a truth more the real what I’m experiencing. The birth of a child from my wife touched on this profoundness, a magic we all accepted yet never understood. But today an ultimate truth was being revealed to me, one I’ve sought after since my first memory I can recall. 

I find myself holding a knife to the throat of an old man, I feel nothing but the wetness of his blood running down my fingers. No soul leaving the body, no feeling of power over another, no nothing. A dead lifeless body falls to the ground. Then I wake up.
