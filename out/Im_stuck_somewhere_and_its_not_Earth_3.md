Hey guys. Still alive. I got power again. I'll explain later.

I woke up on the 5th day to actual responses from my second post. People are aware of what i'm experiencing. Some of them had questions.

One user made a good point. Some expedition was here, spoke English, but I'm not sure how they are from a lab if they brought some little backpack. Surely they would have kept this journal. About the inhuman things, i'm sure the thing in the sea is enough to say that I am not alone.

Another user asked if there was a working landline. Anywhere like this little guard post or the house I was in.

I began checking every wall in the guard post. Nothing like a wall phone. Out of curiosity, I tried calling a random number from my friends. To no surprise, that went nowhere.

Knowing the house, it could actually be possible, I don't think I bothered to explore the other half of the house or pay attention, but that was a seven hour walk. Knowing the little food and water I've found.... yeah no thanks.

The last thing was the boat. The captain. That *man.*

I still remember him, but honestly there's part of me that just dosen't want to. This place is already surreal enough and I don't know how i'm going to explain it to people if I ever get back. They'll think i'm crazy.

I continued to follow the road, closing the oil can tight, less than half full, storing it in the backpack, then holding the oil lamp.

Another two hours had passed.

"The hell?"

The road just stopped. I overlooked the shoreline below, jagged rocks that carved into the side of the ground. The asphalt broke off just afterwards, rusted rebar pointing out in several spots.

There had obviously been some sort of bridge entrance but it seemed to be long gone. There was a branching road down a hill to the right.

The shore was no different. I knew what to expect. More pebble-covered grounds, rock formations. A piece of driftwood in the sea, sitting there for a moment, then carrying on.

The sun began to set(I know, it seemed somewhat quick to happen) when a tower set the scene after walking far enough. Lighthouse.

I never got to enter one, only saw them in the backgrounds of some movie sets. It was underwhelming, the brick was aging with chipped white paint and some vines, no red stripes, and I just got the wrong feeling from it.

There *was* a wooden stairwell up to the tower, but most of it was a pile of rubble, so I spent another thirty minutes trying to remember that one time I did rock climbing when I was twelve. A few bruises, a minor cut, nothing to worry about hopefully.

I relit the oil lamp and started studying the lighthouse. There was debris on the concrete floor along with a few crates and old furniture, plus a small side area with a woodstove.

The stairway was rusty in spots but still held. I ascended carefully, nice slow steps. I got to near the top when there was a room with the light box and a wide desk.

The only thing I could recognize was what looked like a giant battery. The rest of the tabletop was littered in all sorts of metal things, wires, speakers. Out of curiosity, I immediately started testing the chargers with the battery to see if it could charge my phone. To my surprise, one of them worked.

While that could happen, I continued to search the rest of the lighthouse. The door to the outside balcony was jammed shut, but there was a short window I could peep through. Same waters, foggy, cloudy.

I looked at the light box. A sign on the wall was written in a mix of gibberish and some weird heiroglyphic shit but I was able to tell it needed oil. The canister was still half full, but I wasn't sure how much the lighthouse needed.

Back on the lower floor, I began using a rock I grabbed from the shore to break the crates. One almost seemed like the equipment of a naval officer. There was a uniform almost pristine if it wasn't for dust and a sabre with a blade that would probably crumble if I used it *once.*

Another crate had empty canisters. There was a rocking chair in a corner that had fallen apart.

It was cold inside so I took another courageous hike back down to bring up wood.

It got smoky for an hour but the building eventually became warmer. Phone charged, got to play a bit of Mahjong, just enjoying the moment.

After having probably a little too much fun playing a few mobile games I completely forgot about food.

"For christs sake!"

Nothing in the lighthouse. The hunger was starting to get to me bad. I've maybe lost ten pounds, hard to tell without a scale, but i'm surprised I can fall asleep.

Day six.

I relit the fire with more wood, this time looking for stuff that was drier.

I tried to study something out of the pile of metal bits and parts. I had no idea who had been here but ultimately what they tried to build. I figured there would be some sort of journal like the guard box but i've searched every inch of every platform.

I took a little hike outside the lighthouse. I was just trying to find food. I had no idea what was safe and what wasn't. It was cold too, dosen't seem like the time for anything to fruit in the trees or swim around.

I spent a good hour delicately moving some of the oil to the smaller containers I found in the crate, including one for fixing stuff like hinges in the hopes I can get the balcony door open.

After an eternity it felt the door finally shifted open. I had to be very careful. Some parts of the balcony were rotted away. While looking down, I noticed the back of the rocks stained in some pigment, and what looked like a container.

I was excited for the idea that anything I ever needed right now was in that, I nearly lost grip from the balcony. I climbed around the rocks and grabbed the case of metal.

The optimism drained when it opened.

Caked on the sides was a lighter version of the pigment that stained the rocks, and something bundled up in string. This was the note I looked for:

*Day eight.*

*There's nothing here. Praise and pity the souls who built this and could never see it live the most of itself.*

*It keeps returning. Words fathom never what I keep hearing. Tonight, we will finally talk.*

Sunset approached and I swore I could watch the bulb flicker and shine a damp light. It carved a path into the unknown.

It kept going for thirty minutes until I had burned through a good amount of the oil I had. Maybe another few nights with the small lantern and that was that.

I sat on the ground floor, cold concrete and exposed rebar in spots. I sobbed there until I fell asleep. I was never able to think anything straight.

The night was long since high when I woke up to a rumble of sorts in the distance. I started climbing the stairs like I was being chased. I opened the door, and saw moonlight shine on the sea.

I was able to make out a boat in the distance, slide past by. I rushed to relight the bulb with whatever I had.

Then I heard the ship cut out abruptly.

When I looked back, I watched pieces of white metal floating around the waves, and then the air felt really heavy. Almost like it *actually* got heavier.

Suddenly this huge force slammed itself against the lighthouse. I start climbing down quickly after noticing several bricks shift. I almost fell down the stairs which began to slowly shake.

Half-way down the wall supports finally gave up and I suddenly found myself swinging towards the other wall. Thankfully it wasn't too fast and I was able to reduce what could have been a really ugly fall to a few bruises. It all feels like listening to the beat of a heart when you're right next to it.

I thought about grabbing stuff like the lantern and the other items but I chose to just leave when a brick nearly smoked my head. I quickly climbed back down and headed for the treeline.

Then something weird happened.

I must have fallen asleep because I didn't move a step from where I was last running. It was now daylight and the skies were clear.

I had no idea how long I was on the ground, but while cleaning off my clothes I felt stinging pain on my right arm.

I roll up the sleeve to reveal a singular, clean mark across the skin. No bleeding but looked recently created.

I turned around, and the lighthouse was a pile of debris. Nothing stood on the original rocks. Whatever, if anything had knocked it over was long gone.

I continued walking forward. I checked my phone which I had in my pocket. Still mostly charged, signal is just as bad when I was at the dugout. Averaging two bars.

It was a few more hours along the coastline. Something finally caught my eye.

The coast eventually turned from fine sand to higher cliffs and rocks. The way along the hill was covered in all sorts of makeshift traps, the most prominent being spikes. There were some other creations which i'm not too sure about. Some skeletons i've never seen half-buried along the path up the hill.

I tried looking for a way around but the terrain here is steep and they fortified this place to hell. What was so important to protect?

I'm in some makeshift hut from god knows how long ago. I've been hearing noises, some new and even more humane than the last, but i've learned to avoid investigating. I've set the phone to "do not disturb" and ive covered all openings to see through the walls. Till next time.
