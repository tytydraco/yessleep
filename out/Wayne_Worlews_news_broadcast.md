Cartoon Network is a channel that many of you probably know and love. It's a channel that many people watched as kids, and still watch it to this day, i suppose. Amongst many different kids channels, Cartoon Network was the cool kids option, for kids who were "too mature" for Nickelodeon and Disney channel. It had action, comedy, and even shows that were weird as hell. But there was a time when Cartoon Network started to experiment a little, looking for variety in their catalogue of shows. 

Cartoon Network made many experimental tv series, some of which became classics, while others faded into obscurity. Like some live actions shows they made, which was kinda weird for a channel that primarily showed animated shows. But one show stands out from the rest of the failures and experiments. A show that Cartoon Network made people forget. This show being, a new broadcasting show starring a puppet character by the name of Wayne Worlew.

During 2011 to 2013, Cartoon Network executives thought about making a news broadcasting show for the viewers. But in order to make kids watch their show, they needed some sort of hook, something that can attract the audience. And so they started the production of the project with the codename of "News & Stuff". It was difficult fo find a host for the series, but at some point, a lightbulb lit up in creators heads. What if instead of boring human host, the host was a funny character, and not just any character, but a puppet. So they invited a man by the name of Patrick Greenfield, who was a puppet maker, to create a puppet for the show. And after Wayne Worlew was brought into this world, they decided to let Patrick play him on the show.

When the show premiered, it was an unexpected surprise to many people, but in a good way. The show was not your average news broadcast. Most of the topics were related to things that kids might find interesting, like new games, new movies, interesting events in the world, filled with jokes and comedy sketches involving the main host, Mr. Worlew himself. Wayne was a weird little puppet. He looked like a middle aged man, with a long nose, bluish skin, big eyes, a bald spot on his head, black hair and his iconic brown suit, under which he had a Hawaiian shirt. He would explain the topic of the day, and would crack jokes from time to time. Like i said before, the show had gags and sketches, mostly involving the "crew" of the show inside the show, by that i mean, Patrick made more puppets for the show, that would occasionally appear from time to time and do funny stuff. It was like chilean 31 Minutos, but for american audiences, i guess.

It was fun, and people really liked it, which was a surprise for the cartoon network crew, and a big surprise to Patrick, who was proud and overjoyed by these news. The show had a good run, and things were going great for Cartoon Network. Until.. tragedy happened. Patrick had a family, and a beloved daughter by the name of Alice, who commited suicide due to problems at her school, these problems being mostly bullying. To Patrick, this death was unexpected, because he would always try to cheer his girl up and tried to support her however he can, but sadly, he was left heartbroken after his daughter's passing. 

One day, during the production of Episode 17 of the show, Patrick came to the studio and asked the team if he could change Wayne's clothes for this episode. The request was odd, but since it was partially his show, they did not mind. Instead of his usual suit, Wayne was wearing a black suit with grey shirt underneath. The episode was going smoothly for awhile, until Wayne suddenly changed the topic. He was supposed to talk about Moomin Park in Finland, but instead he started talking about the passing of Alice Greenfield. The only thing that is left of this episode is the audio of what Wayne was saying during that part of the episode. At that point, Wayne lowered his head, and said these following words..quote..

"At 11:00, November 15th, girl by the name of Alice Gloria Greenfield has commited suicide due to constant harassment at her school. She was a beautiful, smart but shy young girl, who deserved the world, but now she is gone. People can be very cruel to people who they do not understand and view as weak. And nobody was able to help her, not her teachers, not even her family. You watched as she got punished for things she did not deserve, you laughed at her, you hurt her, and you loved it. You bastards didn't do shit to protect your own student, and now look what happened. Are you people proud of yourself, huh? She is gone, and you don't even care? You keep telling me you are sorry, but you are not. You knew it was your fault, you just don't want to acknowledge it! Wouldn't it be funny if i didn't do shit when i saw your child get bullied and constantly harassed? It's not my kid! So why would i care huh!? You just made an enemy for life! You will pay for everything that you've done to my girl! Your blood will spill and i will drink it out of a wine glass, you fucking scums!"

Cartoon Network interrupted the broadcast of the episode, and tried to stop Patrick, but he just left the studio and was never seen again. Later that week, several people got killed at Lincoln High School, 5 teachers got slaughtered that day, and the next day, 3 children got found inside the school's dumpster. Victims were found with drill holes in their body, and wounds that were left with a bunt object, strong enough to break bones. The victims were 3 classmates, and 5 teachers that knew Alice Greenfield back when she was still alive. After several days, the killer was caught in the act at the house of the school's principal. Police found Patrick Greenfield sitting on a chair, with the puppet of Wayne on one hand, and glass of what seems to be blood inside the wine glass, sittinf next to the corpse of the former principal. Patrick got sent to prison for manslaughter,  the only thing he said before getting locked up behind bars was "Their blood was delicious", clearly not feeling any regret for his actions. 

The show got quickly swept under the rug to the disappointment of people who loved the show and who probably haven't seen the 17th episode. Any information related to the show got wiped from the internet years ago, and many people probably forgot about the show and the incident. Cartoon Network does not want to associate with "Wayne Worlew's news broadcast" and Patrick, trying to make people forget about it like it was all a dream. And i guess they succeeded, because you can't find clips, photos, recordings of the show on the web. The only thing that they forgot about was the puppet of Wayne Worlew, which went missing some time after Patrick's arrest.
