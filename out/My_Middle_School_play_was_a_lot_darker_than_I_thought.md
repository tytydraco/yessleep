It’s Wednesday now, been like three days. Thought I would give you another…Well I don’t know, I guess I’m just using this for my thoughts and maybe advice? Basically just a log.

Anyway, I was cleaning out or rather helping my mom with the garage sell. I found a box full of junk mostly old papers, fils, and folders. I searched through them, seemed like school papers from back when. I decided to go through the box. 

To my surprise it I found my old phone. It was small flip phone, a Motorola V3, unfortunately it was dead of course. I decided to pocket it, I’ll try to get it up started. 

Though I couldn’t thoroughly look through the box, Since I heard my dad smash something on the concrete. I don’t know, he was mad about my mom selling some of his old stuff that he left in her garage. I saw that he broke a lamp. Glass was all over the ground; I just grabbed my sister’s hand ushering her into the house instead, a 6 year old shouldn’t be hearing this, unfortunately they yell as loud as a siren. I grabbed headphones and gave them to her. I wished they weren’t like this when she was born, I mean they were sable with me. I guess every

Sorry I’ll put Becca’s script up.

Act: 2
Scene 1: The Bitter Girl 
[Enter CAROLINA forest setting. ]

CAROLINA


…Black Willow…

While I’m writing this, I’m just as confused as you are. Now last time I wrote the scripts word by word, but Becca sent me a link of hers. At first I thought she wrote it down on her laptop like I did. I want to say it’s a prank. But I know Becca and she doesn’t do pranks, haven’t done them since high school. I’ll text her when I finish my college essay.

7:43PM

Apparently she never sent me a link, and when I went to go look back at it there was nothing. But it didn’t matter because her stupid paper was faded and stained to the brim. Though she sent me a video.

The play starts off with my character, Carolina, complaining on about Everett not walking her down the path. My character soon meets Becca’s character, Elise, which was Carolina’s sister. I’ll give you some lines that were exchange between us and the action as well.

————-————-————-————-

ELISE
Oh Carolina, where have you been? Mother has been worrying about you. 

CAROLINA 
With Everett, sorry to worry you sister.

ELISE
You know mother is sick, you can’t be gone for long. We are the only thing she has.

The video glitch out and skip to a further scene in the play. It showed Sophie and Everett talking and skipping in circles. Then skipped yet again to me and Becca. I wish I could tell you what it showed, but to be honest I couldn’t make it out. The video went to static and cut to Everett.

————-————-————-————-

EVERETT
Unfortunately, I have to go now Sophie. I do wish we could socialize moreover. 

[EVERETT walks off towards the curtains]

SOPHIE
Nooo, stay. Mother won’t mind it.
[Grabs EVERETT arm]

EVERETT
Mother wouldn’t like me staying out too long…

It cuts yet again to another part. it shows my character mom, which was one of the teachers on the play, in bed pale faced and short breaths. The mom passed on in this Act, having a rope tied around her waist and both me and Becca on our knee’s hands together in a pray. The teacher then was pulled up by the rope. This was to give off as she died and went to heaven. 

It continued on with my character trying to find Everett for comfort and finding him with Sophie. My character got mad and bitter and swore to never speak to him.

But just as the video ended, the camera dropped and cut to the woods with the red path I saw way before… Then it showed… me? What the fuck? I don’t remember going outside…Or did I?

I walked out down the red path, my arms stuck to my sides looking straight ahead. The video then looped, having me walking down the path on repeat; at least I think because I didn’t fade out into the darkness of the trees. Then I heard barking. Like my own dogs barking? Was this what they were barking at? But not it couldn’t have been because I was inside the house. 

After a few minutes of this, it cut to my window with me inside. . . . I got up hastily, knocking down my chair in the process and looking out to my window.

“Who the fuck is there!?” I yelled, moving towards my window.

“Hello? Come the fuck out! You’re not fooling me!” I kept shouting.

I then opened my window, looking out towards the forest that was out near my house. I then looked at the ground and found a camcorder. It was red, rusty, and had dust on the top of it. I picked it up, it was still recording. As soon as I turned it off it died. 

When I get it charging, I’ll tell you as soon as I can. I don’t know who was recording let alone how they could be so damn quiet. But the bigger question was how Becca could have sent me a video on a camcorder that was live? Unless I’m just stupid.
