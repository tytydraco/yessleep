It started three nights ago. I was washing dishes when I looked up and saw him.

A man.

He was at the border of my garden, just beyond the fence, indistinct in the dim light of the streetlamp. I had thought at first that I was imagining it—maybe a tree casting some strange shadow. But no.

He was there.

I didn't see his face, but I knew that he was looking at me. Just. standing. Not stirring.

A shiver ran down my spine. I live alone. My house borders a small patch of woods, but I've never seen anyone out there before—at least, not at night.

I was paralyzed in front of the sink, thudding heart racing inside me.

And then, after what felt like forever, I forced myself to turn away. Maybe he was just a drunk guy who had wandered farther than he should have. Maybe if I turned around, he'd vanish.

I went to bed, trying to convince myself that everything was okay.

The next morning, I peered out the window. He was gone.

A flash of relief swept over me. Probably just some temporary freak.

That night, as I was locking down the building, I gazed out.

He was back once more.

Same spot. Same stance.

He hadn't budged.

A prickle of discomfort crept up my spine. I grabbed my phone and hesitated, deciding whether or not to call the police. What would I even say?

"There's a man standing by my fence."

That wasn't illegal. Just creepy.

So I did something else. I flipped on the garden light.

He didn't blink.

I crept closer to the glass, my breath misting on the cold window.

Nothing.

No shifting. No blinking. He just. stood there.

Watching.

I closed the curtains and tried to sleep, but my head was racing with thoughts. What if he was planning something? What if he was waiting for me to lower my guard?

Tiredness eventually got the better of me. I had to have slept because the next thing I knew, my alarm was blaring.

Morning.

I leaped out of bed and ran to the window.

Gone again.

The pattern was repeated the next night. And the one after that.

Every evening, exactly at sundown, he would appear. Staying in one spot. Never moving. Never speaking.

By the third night, I broke.

I took a flashlight, my heart thudding, and stepped outside onto my rear porch. Cold air stung my face, and my exhalations blasted out in tight, white gusts.

He didn't move.

I made another step, holding the beam on him.

And that is when I last saw his face.

Or better—the lack of it.

His skin was smooth. Featureless. No eyes, no nose, no mouth. Just a smooth, blank, pale surface, as though something had cleaned him out.

I took a step back, a scream caught in my throat. The flashlight flashed.

For the first time in three nights—

He moved.

Not much. Just a jerk of the head, slow and jerky, as though he were nodding to me.

Then he took a step forward.

I ran.

I slammed the door, locked it, and closed the curtains in the entire house. I shook too much to call the police. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen instead and sat against the wall, forcing myself to listen.

Silence.

No knocking. No scratching. No creak of footsteps on the porch.

But I knew he was still there.

I barely slept.

When morning came, I forced myself to look.

Gone.

I phoned my friend, told them I was sick, and spent the day at their place. I lied to them.

Now. I'm home. The sun is setting.

And I'm scared to look out.

Because I know what I will see.

He'll be standing there. Waiting.

And sooner or later—

He's going to move closer.
