Once the shock wore off, the climb back down the cliff face didn’t even register on me. It was all a blur before my blinding red vision. I vaguely remember marching back through the woods, and the harsh, unstable rattle of the catwalk as my boots stormed down it. I remember June’s panicked cries for me to slow down, afraid that I might take the structure clean off the wall, and I remember her frantic worry when I tied a rope over the rail of the catwalk and slid the entire drop down back to the concrete like a fire pole.

Hell, the searing pain in my hip from hitting the ground didn’t even process in my head as I stood back up in the alleyway with the massive kingfisher door.

The first thing I did while waiting for June to follow was turn and look to the base of our makeshift ladder. I clicked on my flashlight and shone it at the metallic feet, the angry thunder in my chest growing into a more steady concern for only a moment. When I saw no second Hensley—no undeveloped lump of meat or remnants of tissue—just asphalt and a pool of dark blood, I went numb again. Numb like back at the elevator a few moments ago.

That monster came back and took my 5^(th) clone. Ate her up while she was probably half baked. The monster that was following us—that we could have distracted or done something—*anything.* We just left her.

We just left her…

The thought seared the boilers back to life, and steam huffed hot from my nostrils against the cold abyssal air as I stomped for the metal door.

“Ann!” I shouted at the top of my lungs. “Ann, open this fucking door!”

Behind me, I finally heard a yelp of fear as June got the courage to take the plunge, more afraid of being left behind a second time today than falling to her death. I barely paid her mind as she slammed the asphalt and fell into a tumble to break her fast descent, another grunt escaping her lips.

We were being loud. Louder than we’d ever been while in this place, but I just didn’t care. I needed Ann to hear me. I needed her to hear the anger, and the rage, and the hurt as it rolled from my lungs in raspy growls of thunder.

As I pleaded and fought the barrier to no avail, part of me began to wonder if maybe I was wrong. Maybe Ann hadn’t left us. We didn’t know what was in the compound; maybe once she got down there, there was something waiting, and it killed her. She wasn’t able to send the lift back up because she was dead.

If she was dead, though, that meant Hope was too, and that was a thought I couldn’t bear with. And besides, Ann had seen us coming when she stepped into that elevator. If she’d wanted us on it with her, she would have found a way to stop it…

My kicking and pounding against the foot-thick metal was nothing more than rain on a tin roof. It certainly sounded like it compared to the loud drumming a massive beast slamming against it was able to create. After calling out a few more times, I turned sharp to the camera above the door.

“Ann, I know you’re in there! You—fucking—bitch! Open the door!” I commanded, throwing in furious pounding between my words.

A sharp radio screech beside me made me jump, and so did June, who had been standing by nervously, her eyes on the tower's light. My head whipped to trace it, and I saw where it was coming from. A small speaker on the keypad of the door.

“You need to be more quiet before something hears you.” I heard my own voice call out.

I stepped close and slammed my fists to the wall, propping myself up with them as I leaned in, my nose practically touching it, “Ann, what the *fuck* is wrong with you?! Open the door!”

There was a long pause. A hesitation so long that it actually made me confused if what I was hearing on the other end was Ann. Her next words confirmed that it was, however.

“I… I’m not going to do that, Hensley.”

I stared at the speaker in disbelief for a few seconds before my face tensed in rage once more, and I pounded the wall, “Are you serious?! What is going on, Ann? Why are you doing this?!”

“Hensley, seriously. You need to shut up, or something is going to—”

“No! Fuck off with that—you don’t care! If you cared, you wouldn’t have left us to die!”

“I didn’t leave you to die. There was nothing chasing after you immediately. There still isn’t. And if you’d like to keep it that way, then shut. The hell. *Up.”*

I wanted to kill her. I mean that, and it scares me. I genuinely think that if there was no door between Ann and me in that moment, I could have grabbed her by the throat and squeezed the life from her pathetic, weak little eyes. I couldn’t stand hearing my own voice saying all of this. I couldn’t stand the condescending tone she took with me as if she was all the sudden in control now. The worst part was, she technically was.

Most of all, though, I think I couldn’t stand the fact that this was a part of *myself* that was committing such a heinous act.

“I swear to God, Ann, when I get in there—”

“You aren’t going to get in here. You can’t now. I’m the only one who can open or shut this door, and if you want me to do that for you, you’re going to do what I tell you.”

I winced away from the box with utter disgust and shook my head, “*Excuse* me?”

“I don’t want you to shut up for your sake, Hensley, I still need you alive to help me.”

“Why the *hell* am I going to help you after what you just did?”

“Because I have Hope,” Ann said coldly.

*I* said coldly. My own voice saying something so dark and haunting that it made me shiver.

“Ann, what did you do to her?! Is she okay?” I called a little louder, as if it would somehow help her hear me, “Hope? Hope are you okay in there?”

“Hensley, shut up and listen to me!” Ann hissed “Hope is fine—I didn’t do anything to her. At least, as fine as she can be after June got that black shit all over her with her little stunt at the hospital.”

I gave a slight side glance to June, seeing her shift anxiously and look to the floor. I wasn’t really in a mood to defend, but I *was* in the mood to not give my shit half any satisfaction.

“Hope was going to die either way. June saved her.”

“That doesn’t matter now,” Ann continued, “The point is, she’s fine, but she’s sick. And seeing as you’re already on a timer with that thing coming back from below, I’d say that you really can’t afford to sit here crying at me.”

I took a deep breath to simmer off a little bit of steam. It wasn’t much, but it was enough for at least one rational thought to come to me. Ann was right, this spite was only wasting time.

“What do you want from me?” I asked through gritted teeth.

“What do you think I want?” She scoffed, “I want out of here, Hensley. And I’m going to get out of here one way or another.”

“So that’s it, huh? All that talk of getting us all home—all that reassurance that we’ll find a way to make it work with the four of us—and you still couldn’t stand not being the sole version of us to make it back.”

For the one holding all the cards, Ann sure folded easily. Taking her turn to fly into rage, she screamed back, “You had your chance, Hensley! I told you back at the rig, you had your whole life to get it together! So many times you could have made the right decision to improve ourselves, or fight to keep our relationships alive, or go to a single damn doctor's check-up so we wouldn’t be rotting away from the inside right now! But *no.* No, you just needed to mope, and bitch, and sit around until we lost *everything*. What a joke you turned us into—mom would be embarrassed if she was still around to see us.”

“Go to hell,” I reflexively muttered.

“It’s *my* turn now. You had your chance, and you *failed*. You failed us in here too; all of your godawful decisions that have almost gotten us killed. Well I’m not going to sit around and wait for that to happen,” Ann growled, her tone dropping back into a low threat. “That thing coming for us is only connected to you. You’re the one it wants, so you’re going to be the one to stay outside and do the dirty work.”

“It won’t stop at me,” I told her, “You saw the logs Shae and the others left. It’ll tear through the whole shelf until it finds you.”

“Oh, I saw the logs alright. But they were trapped *out there,* remember? It’s squeaky clean in here. No bodies, no blood, no damaged equipment or any signs of struggle. Doesn’t look like that thing ever made it inside the real bunker. I’d venture to guess that Shae and his crew got locked outside when everyone first evacuated, and they were in a similar situation to us. I’ll be just fine.”

“So you’re taking a note from them, then?” I sneered, “You’re going to stoop to Shae’s level to get out? Use us then leave us to die?”

“No, Hensley, I’m not a monster,” Ann warned, “Like I said, I don’t want you to die, and it’s not just because I need your help.”

“Get to the point then,” I demanded, sick of hearing that smug voice.

“Get me the last body from that rig. If you do it, once I get the machine up and running then make it out of here, I’ll leave the door open for you. There’s food in here—enough to last a lifetime rationed between the three of you. Plus, you’d still have the vending machines if you ran out. You’d be able to live safe from the stuff outside, and in relative comfort—it’s not so bad in here from what I’ve seen. Lots to do.”

I sat in genuine awe for a moment at what I was hearing. The fact that Ann was actually trying to pedal this option as something good and reassuring was sickening. It was more than that—it was downright inhumane.

“Wow, what a favor,” I laughed in her face, “We get to be stuck by ourselves in hell for the rest of our mortal lives? You really are better than Shae after all.”

“I’m giving you at least a chance, Hensley. That’s more than they got. And at least you’d still have each other.”

I laughed incredulously, “Fuck you. You know this is wrong—I know you know how messed up this is, Ann!”

That hit a nerve with her. I could hear it in the ensuing silence. I was right, but I think she was so broken and so far gone by now that she felt like it was too late.

It was something I felt often, though not to this extreme of an extent. During fights when I’d say something hurtful. When I was lashing out at people and being nasty for no good reason. The Hensley special was me making a series of impulsive, bad decisions or actions, then immediately regretting them. But I was a prisoner to my own stubbornness. My bitterness and rage. I’d make awful choices, but by then, I was in too deep, and the only way out in my mind was forward.

That’s why the night I left Trevor behind along with my life, I had only planned to be gone a few days, but then those days turned to a week, then that week into two…

I don’t know how long I would have driven had I not ended up here, and maybe that gave Ann some credibility to the fact that I really blew it.

Empathizing with her now, even past the heinous actions, I knew why she was doing this. She was tired, and she was scared, and she was just ready to get the hell home, back to normalcy with just her and Trevor. I tried to appeal to this now, losing my angry tone, and speaking softly.

“Ann, please… It’s not too late, I promise. Just—open the door. I won’t hold any of this against you—June either,” I added, turning to the girl.

She looked pathetic standing beneath the florescent flood light, tear streaked cheeks and hugging herself. I don’t even think she had it in her to be angry, too afraid of confrontation.

“Just let us in,” I whispered, “please. We can still all fix this together. It’s not too late…”

There was another long pause, and in it, I leaned my head against the stone above the speaker box and prayed. I prayed that Ann would just come to her senses and press the button on her end. I prayed that I would suddenly hear the metallic whir of the doors grinding open, and that we’d finally be somewhere safe. It was only a few seconds, but it still felt like I had hours to plead over and over in my head that Ann might have mercy and open the door.

My prayers fell on deaf ears.

“I’m not going to do that, Hen…” Ann responded, her voice weak and solemn. Almost regretful.

Tears began welling in my eyes, and I shook my head. The anger came back, but I was too drained now to express it, so my words only fell out in a weak, bitter tone, “T-Then no… no, I’m not going to do this for you. If we’re stuck here, so are you—I’d rather die than let you go back and hijack my life.”

“Hen…” Ann spoke softly again, warning in her voice. I didn’t like that she was suddenly using my nickname. She had no right. “Please… Please don’t make this hard. I brought Hope down here because I wanted to keep her safe while she’s hurt, and as an incentive for you, but if you don’t get me that other body, then…”

My stomach did a full lurch that almost brought me to my knees. My head snapped toward the gauge on the hatch nearby and saw that it was only lit ¾’s of the way, a fact that brought me at least a little relief. Still, the implications that hung in the quiet night air were as heavy as the metal doors between us.

I didn’t even have any words to respond to her with. I was too in shock at the lengths she was willing to go here to even respond to it. Instead, I turned to June, who was still standing there staring, crying harder now and shivering.

I faced the box and spoke again, “T-Then please, if you’re going to make me do this, at least let June in. She doesn’t deserve any of this—she’s just like you. Just let her inside—I’ll go get the body.”

“You’re going to need help carrying that body,” Ann said plainly, “You’ve needed help at every single rig so far, I’m sure this one won’t be different. Besides, I can’t trust her either.”

“Ann, come on, it’s *June.*” I pleaded, “You know that she wouldn’t try anything, just please, don’t make her die out here with me!”

“Neither of you will die,” Ann said to us, leaving one more gap of silence before she closed out her sentence, “Not if you just do what I ask. Now stop wasting time and go get me that corpse.”

“Ann, don’t—” I tried to call before she could walk away, but it was too late. I heard a static pop from the speaker, and everything went quiet.

I stood there for a long while, just like at the elevator above, heavily weighing our options. No matter how much I pondered, though, my mind could only run back to the same conclusion over and over again.

We were screwed.

Ann had basically won. She’d somehow plotted this out perfectly so that everything worked in her favor. Somehow, she was the only one with the code. She had Hope for leverage, and she had me and June isolated outside so that there was no way for us to interfere and stop her. Even if we did this—even if we got the body for her and she held up her end of the deal, she still got to escape. She’d get to go home to Trevor, Dad, and everyone else to live *our* life while Hope, June and I got to rot away forever in this godforsaken abyss.

I thought about it all for a while, but then the adrenaline of everything finally wore off, and I collapsed to the asphalt. Pushing my body to its limit on an injured hip had finally taken its toll, and my muscles could barely move to scrape myself up. June rushed over to help me up, and together we numbly made our way back over to the tower just in time for the light to click on red.

Wordlessly, me and my one remaining clone climbed the stairs back to the office and collapsed into our makeshift beds. In a sense, it almost felt good to be ‘home’ (or, at least what had become our home here), but there was a profound sense of grief permeating over everything. I looked across the space to the desk cove opposite of me. To Hope’s empty sheets.

It was her.

We had no more hope, literally. She was the one good thing here. The one moral compass pushing us onward and keeping the spirits high. Not only was she ripped away from us, but the last image of her in my head was of her injured and sick, screaming for dear life as she was yanked into the jaws of that creature.

The strongest one of us lay across a dead body on a hospital bed, battered and beaten like fresh roadkill. I replayed the scene in my head; us running and me apologizing to her. The way she grabbed my hand with her frail, shaking one and told me everything was okay. It was all too familiar. Even her face and expression, past all the blood and tears and grime, she looked so much like her—just like Mom.

The thought slammed me like a freight train, and my watery eyes couldn’t hold their flow anymore. I curled my knees to my chest and fell over into my sheets, sobbing softly for the friend I’d let down.

I knew I needed to get up. I needed to move. Take the tunnels to avoid the creature outside right now and get to the next body. Hope was sick and probably dying, and I didn’t trust Ann to properly take care of her. My body physically wouldn’t let me, however. It was too drained. Weaker than I’d ever felt in my life, and with a fractured bone to boot. I was no good to save Hope if I wasn’t strong enough to survive this next rig.

Thoughts turned over and over in my head as I lay there, going from sad, pitying ones to a low, simmering rage. Ann’s words played on repeat in my brain, her snide voice rekindling the fire in me. That flame chased the dark hopelessness away, and instilled back in me what I’d lost. Determination.

Ann wasn’t going to win this; there had to be a way to best her. Somehow, she’d gotten that code, and if we could figure it out, we could find a way to get in and stop her before she used the drill to get back home. But how had she found it? None of us had ever left each other’s sight since they dropped into the world one by one. If Ann found the code somewhere, it had to be some place we’d already gone together.

I tried to start sorting options in my head, retracing every moment since Ann’s arrival to find out where she could have gotten it. The key word was try, however. My brain was too stressed and overwhelmed and clouded with tiredness. The locations and instances would appear in my brain in a hazy blur of fog, but there were no sparks in them to ignite a thought.

One by one, they passed through my brain, counting scenes instead of sheep, and that’s when the fatigue fully caught up to me. My body demanded rest. It needed to repair itself, and it couldn’t fully do that while I was awake. I tried hard to fight it, but eventually, I was drawn down into the darkness against my will, the state of my body too weak to resist it.

I wish I would have tried to fight harder.

As soon as I drifted off, I felt myself falling. Slipping through a space between the physical and the spiritual until I broke through to the other side.

The roaring soar of whipping wind was suddenly all around me. Black grains of glittering glass struck my skin like hornet stings, and my heart began to thunder fast. My skin felt cold, and every part of me ached as I tried to move. It wasn’t because my waking body was in pain, however. It was something else.

I could feel the sting of my cracked hip still, but there was more than that. Two injuries that I never had—or that I only had the last time I dreamed.

My leg from when I fell down the dune last time was still nothing but a limp, dead chunk of meat hanging uselessly below the knee, and my dislocated arm was still out of its socket. It seemed that when I’d left my dreaming self last time I visited this place, she was still in the same state I’d left her in.

 I was somewhere new this time, though, no longer in the valley between the mighty black dunes. This stretch of the desert was flat and barren, a slightly sloped decline that led farther down into an endless field. The wind curled along the ground with the decline, carrying the debris and urging me to roll along with it like a plastic bag in the wind. It was too heavy to move me, but it turned out, it didn’t need to. The shifting sand was enough.

Like a conveyor belt, the soft ground beneath me shifted and glided along, inching its way up my limbs as it carried me further. I grunted and winced as I forced my nearly immobile body to keep moving so that I wasn’t swallowed whole by the glistening shift. I looked out into to the desert to see when the slope would find its bottom, but my heart came to a stop when I finally made out what lay ahead through my feeble night vision.

Against the horizon, the distinct line of shifting ebony dunes suddenly gave way to a whole new kind of black. An abyss darker than even the one I’d been living in for the past few months. A darkness so incomprehensible that it made my chest tight to look at.

It felt like I was looking at nothing. The literal concept of nothing. It’s something that we can’t fathom because for as long as we have existed, humanity has never been able to observe a lack of matter; everything we see—inside of our galaxy or out—is *something;* a collage of atoms and matter that form the earth, the stars, and everything beyond.

This though? This darkness on the horizon; it was none of that. It was the space between the stars. It was the universe before its conception. It was all that was before there was anything. Primordial. Ancient. Unknowable.

All in form of another abyss resting on the deserts edge.

The hole was wide, so vast that I couldn’t see its other side. Still, I could tell it was a hole based on the even, steady curve that lined its edge before running off into the dark. The sand was shifting toward it at a rapid rate, but I must have still been miles away with how slow it approached on the horizon.

Even from so far, I could see sand bucketing over the edge and cascading into the venta-black pit to whatever lay within. I was in the top of the universe’s biggest hourglass, slowly shifting away with the seconds before I dropped through its neck into the bottom half below.

All of that may sound horrifying, and believe me, it was, but it was still the least of my worries.

*Crick—CRACK—pop!*

Over the whipping wind and the hissing sand, I heard the sound that I was hoping to not hear for the rest of my time in the abyss. Cracking bones and whispers of the damned drawing ever nearer.

My stalker had once again found me in my dreams, and this time, there was nowhere to hide. No beast it was feasting on to distract it. No towering dunes for me to escape behind. I was in a vast, open plain, my pale skin contrasted brilliantly against the dark stones, and it wasn’t going to take long for it to find me.

Immediately, I hushed my murmurs of agony and went still, whipping my head around to try to hunt down the source of the cracking limbs. The whispers wailing in agony made it hard, and the wind carried the sound every which way, confusing my ears, but eventually, I was able to make out its dark figure against the sand. It was skulking around only a dozen yards away, its details obscured by the storm as usual. One thing I could tell for certain, however, was that it wasn’t facing me. I didn’t see the pale gleam of its face that I had caught a glimpse of once before, so I knew I had time to come up with a plan before it spotted me.

As it moved horizontally, its limbs snapping like lightning with each step, I decided to adjust myself again, the sand already up to my elbows by the time I stopped moving. I clamped my jaw shut tight, then held my breath as I forced my whole body to press against the ground, plucking myself up from it like a turnip. My eyes were glued on Il-Belliegħa the entire time, to make sure it wasn’t going to abruptly turn toward me, but I had to turn away when something unexpected happened.

My torn up leg had sunk a lot deeper beneath the sand than I had thought, the soil turning to muck as blood leaked into it. Every part of my body that wrestled free wasn’t too painful, but when I tried to move the leg that was now beneath wet, packed earth, it tugged hard on the dangling flesh, and my nerves lit up with fiery pain.

I immediately collapsed down against the sand and chomped my teeth together so hard I think I heard one crack. My fists each gripped a wad of dirt in them and squeezed to vent some pressure, the sweat on my palms turning them to mud as I breathed hard and steady. By some miracle, I managed to not let a sound slip, but as my head cleared from the vertigo, I realized that didn’t matter.

There was no way the creature heard me, I know that for certain. No sound I made ever rose above the roaring wind or the whispers in the air. Still, I watched as it whipped its head in my direction, the pale, painted features of its visage staring at me through the whipping glass.

It had sensed my pain somehow.

Panicking, I thought fast on my feet. There was nothing I could do to escape the thing—there was no way. I thought for a moment about throwing myself backward and tumbling down the hill as a makeshift way of running, but the slope was too shallow, and I certainly wouldn’t be fast enough. Besides, that would only put me closer to the pit, and though I didn’t know what waited for me down there, I had a feeling that falling into that unknowable fate would somehow be even worse than facing the demon already before me.

Hiding was my only option, and there was only one way I could think to do it.

Shaking my hands back and forth, I began to sift them beneath the surface of the ground. A second ago, I had just tried to escape the desert's embrace, but now, I welcomed it openly. The beast began rapidly crunching closer, so I hurriedly lay the rest of my body against the ground, heart pounding as I took a deep breath in.

I felt my legs go under, then my butt, then my torso, and finally, my ears went muffled as sand began pouring into them.

I trembled beneath the cold, blood-soaked earth as I waited. Above me, I could hear the faint whistle of the wind still, but it was mostly the sound of the sand as it tossed around my ears. That, and the whispers. To my dismay, I could still hear them clear as crystal. They didn’t have a source like the creature's body, they simply followed the very air surrounding it.

*“Not safe…”* one warned, *“Never safe…”*

*“No, no! It won’t work! Please, you’re our only hope—help us!”*

They were talking to me, I could tell. They were speaking straight to me and about my current plan. I shut my eyes tighter and prayed that their perceptions weren’t shared with Il-Belliegħa’s.

The claustrophobia began to hit me as I felt the pressure on my back intensify. More sand was piling up fast, and if you’ve ever been buried in the sand for fun on the beach before, you know how hard it can be to lift yourself out once you’re done. It wouldn’t take long before I was fully trapped, and I was running out of air fast. What would happen if I ran out of air before I woke up? Could I even die in a dream? My leg and arm remained injured from last time—how connected was I to this form?

Would getting harmed here translate to my real body?

I tried so desperately not to squirm. Not to let the panic in my body get the better of me and make me start thrashing and screaming. The good news was, when I couldn’t take it anymore, I was already too far down and packed in to even move. Sand locked me in from all sides, and I was buried for good. The bad news was also that very same thing.

I wasn’t getting out of here now.

My lungs itched and stung at this point, begging for me to exhale out all the CO2 and inhale a nice, fresh breath of black dirt. To my credit, I lasted a lot longer than I expected, but there comes a point in the panicked struggling where your body just can’t resist its natural inclinations anymore, and I found my lips parting as I tried to huff air out.

The problem now was that the soil was too densely packed around my mouth. Those extra few seconds a slow exhale would have bought me were thwarted when there was nowhere for my exhaled breath to go. The air in my lungs that had gone toxic was trapped, and there was no way for me to expel it.

That really kicked the panic in. My body bucked and squirmed against the foot-thick pile of debris atop me, but it was no use. Most of my limbs were out of commission from injures, and the one arm I did have left was too weak to aid my torso in sitting up.

Pain began to sting through my body—every nerve. My injured parts were starting to throb and scream out at all the pressure being placed down on them, and my lungs felt like they were going to pop without the gift of proper air. My head began to grow dizzy, and in my final moments, I remember thinking, *“Come on, wake up. You need to wake up now.”*

I didn’t wake up though, and all of that pain in my body was screaming out to an unwanted savior above the sand.

I could feel thunderous steps pounding against the surface above me, then the pressure on my back became less. Even in my desperate panic for survival, suddenly my desire to be free shifted back to a desire to stay hidden. I writhed my body in protest, but it was too late. A jolt of dread-filled shivers shuddered through me as I felt a massive, hard hand press against my back.

The next thing I knew, sound returned to my ears as sand spilled from every pocket on my clothes and orifice on my face. Dark grit poured into my eyes from my hair, quickly blinding me to the already blurry sight before me as I was yanked through the air by the beast hunting me.

My body bent painfully over its fingers as it plucked me from the ground, and my leg tearing loose from the dunes made it feel like it was about to rip off entirely. I let out a mighty scream of agony into the howling air, half from the nauseating pain and half because I knew the timer had finally run out.

How ironic it was that at the edge of this hourglass in the middle of the desert, the monster finally tracked me down.

I had no idea what happened now, but I knew one thing. June and I were no longer safe.

I couldn’t see my assailant through my glass-littered eyes, but I gasped and wheezed like a dying animal in its hands as it drew me to something I *could* make out. The pale shell of its face. It held me close, and I thought for a moment that I was about to finally learn what the chomping sound it made was, but then it surprised me.

*“It has you now…”*

*“It sees you…”*

*“It smells you…*

*“God help you…”*

The whispers called out in a broken, fearful chorus, their voices filled with almost an aching regret. Like a cigarette butt, the creature casually tossed me to the sand, and as I began to shift back beneath its surface, on the cusp of death itself, I saw the beast turn opposite of the hole, then take off running.

I snapped awake to June holding me down and calling my name over and over again. It seemed my thrashing in my dream had translated into reality.

“Hensley! Hensley, please! Calm down!”

I gasped for air and fell back against the sheets, sweat staining my brow and eyes the same way I left them when I drifted off; full of tears.

June looked down at me with confusion and concern, and I don’t think my expression helped one bit. I could see her working up the courage to ask what was wrong, but I beat her to it with my answer.

“It saw me, June…” I muttered shakily.

She shook her head, “What? What saw you?” Her face grew fearful as she thought more carefully about the question, then continued, “T-that… that thing? The one that did all this?”

I didn’t directly answer her question. She knew the answer. She was only asking out of disbelief. Suddenly, any plan I may have had to try and find a way to Ann was moot. There was no time. We had to play her game. We needed to get that body to her and pray she held up her end of the bargain or else we were screwed.

“We need to move,” I told her, standing to my aching feet. I stumbled a bit but managed to catch myself on the desk, to which June moved to put a hand on me.

“Hen, you can barely move, we can’t—”

“It doesn’t matter anymore,” I cut her off, “If we don’t try, we get a fate worse than death. Now come on.”

“So, we’re doing what Ann asked?”

“Yeah…”

“But… how can we trust her? What if Hope is already dead and she’s just lying to us?”

I gathered my bag up and slung it on my shoulder, “Doesn’t matter. We’re out of options; we have no other choice.”

“H-How long do we have?”

“I don’t know, June.”

“What do we do if it gets here before we get the body?”

“*I don’t know*, June.”

My timid self began to breathe a little faster, “W-what do you think is at this next rig? If its anything like the last ones, we might not have time to—”

“June!” I snapped, whirling toward her and shooting daggers. My stress had boiled over long ago, and I wasn’t even trying to bother hiding it, my frame too cracked to keep it all in, “I. Don’t. Know. I am just as lost and just as scared as you are in all of this, in case that somehow wasn’t obvious! Just because we can keep a face better than you can doesn’t make me any more qualified to answer what the fuck is going on!”

Poor June shied away from me, and hurt swelled in her eyes, but I couldn’t stop myself. Ann had gotten her filth all over me when she plunged the knife into my back, and I wasn’t even attempting to clean it off.

“We already lost, June! It’s over. The best we can hope for right now is to survive, and the only way we do that is by giving Ann what she wants. So, I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next couple hours, but I do know that things are going to be worse if we keep sitting here. So are you coming or not?”

June stared at me with watery eyes, her mouth open slightly as she tried to decide what to say. She stammered out a few incoherent sounds, as if afraid of giving a definitive answer, but I didn’t wait around to hear them. I was too frustrated to keep looking at the sniveling, weak version of myself cowering against the desk.

Maybe if I had, the hurt in her eyes would have gotten to me. Maybe if I had taken just a second longer to look her over, it would have dawned on me that I wasn’t the main character in this self-made tragedy I was writing. June was me just as much as I was her, clone or not. She faced the same betrayal that I did today. She felt the same stress. She was clearly a more sensitive part of me, and obviously that’s how that part would handle all of this pressure.

If I had dwelled on all that, maybe I would have taken a beat before leaving. Apologized for snapping and told her that I needed her help. Confessed to her how angry I was at Ann, and how much all this was affecting me. We might have been able to comfort each other for a moment before heading out. Gotten that extra little bit of confidence back between us, the way Hope always did.

Instead though, I kept being Ann. I did the same thing I always do, and let my anger get the better of me. I opened my mouth and said something that I really, *really,* should not have said.

“Of course, the last version of me I get stuck with is *you.”* I scoffed, trudging off down the radio station halls.

Looking back now, I can’t help but feel like maybe I got that phrase backward. Of all the people June was left to deal with, I was sorry it had to be me…

I pushed open the doors of the station and started down the dark road, giving a glance up at the tower to make absolutely sure that the shelf was empty. Turning my head out toward the Abyss, I peered past the tops of buildings toward the neon glow cutting the horizon, searchlights shining up into the sky to signal the grand finale. Muffled music was blaring so loudly through the sheet metal walls that I could hear it from where I stood, and I swallowed hard as I wondered what might be waiting inside.

That thought was put on hold, however, as I came to the main street and stopped. A distance away, there was something in the road, laying low and crouched, as if trying to hide against the asphalt.

My muscles tensed, ready to run, and my head whipped back toward the tower. The light was still off, strangely, and looking back, I saw that the creature there wasn’t crouched low; it was simply collapsed against the sidewalk, dead as a doornail.

I took a few curious steps closer to investigate. Normally if two beasts from below tussled and one came out on top, it would take the corpse away to consume it, not leave it out here. The closer I got to this specific body, though, the more I realized I recognized it.

It was the same gangly dark beast that had chased us up the ladder before the last rig.

My heart began to thrum softly at that revelation, and as I drew closer, my throat got tight. The creature's form was nothing too remarkable—at least, not compared to some of the things we’d seen by now. Just a mess of long, spider-like limbs that were curled in on themselves in agony from its death. The interesting part, though, and the thing that made my heart stand still, was its torso.

It was splayed open, its alien innards draped over the sides of its ribs in a gruesome display. Normally I would have assumed that another beast simply slew it then cracked the spider open like a nut to get to the flesh inside, but as I shone my flashlight on the carnage, there was something to note about the scene.

None of the innards were eaten, just pushed aside to make room for one torn open, deflated one in the middle. The stomach, I presumed. From all the guts, they leaked that same black goop that had poured out onto Hope from the hospital serpent, and just past the puddle of it surrounding the body, there was a trail streaked across the asphalt.

A trail of footprints.

Human footprints.

*Bare* human footprints.

Footprints that looked awfully similar to my size.
