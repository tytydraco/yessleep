I have always had sleep issues. 

Since I was a child, I've experienced sleep paralysis at least a handful of times each year. And outside of sleep paralysis, I often have issues with exploding head syndrome (EHS). At least once a month I experience something in that regard. 

But things changed on a low part of my life.

I have suffered significantly from mental health, which increased the frequency of my sleepy paralysis and EHS. It got to the point of happening at least once a week, sometimes more. 

I took medication to try and aliaviate the issue, but nothing changed. I'd say things got even worse. But that was barely just the start. 

I had always had an interest in the paranormal, I've been fascinated by the thought of the existence of things beyond our normal comprehension. Death in particular has never bothered me, at least before what happened, it was always nothing to worry about. 

But because of my issues, and the lack of solutions, I decided to attempt contact with the spiritual world. My intention was to ask for a guardian angel, or (since I believed my issues were caused by paranormal entities) for the monsters to stop their actions. 

So, one day, a long time ago, I gathered up my resources and conducted a ritual that went nowhere, I attempted to contact anything that could possibly communicate with me. But I never got anywhere, nothing ever contacted me. Or at least it's what I think. Because one very critical rule I never followed, is that I never had anything to protect me from "breaches" in the ritual. I didn't really think it was something to worry about. Be it salt circles or pendants. I always assumed that nothing would ever come out of skimming over these rules. 

But after a week of stopping my ritual attempts, as I did several. My sleep improved significantly, I managed to get full hours of sleep with no issues. This lasted for about 6 weeks. Before, as soon as the sixth week ended, I suddenly came under a significant attack.

I still remember the dream. Inside of it, I was talking to friends, and they were discussing and showing me information about a supposed paranormal entity that seemed to have reached our world and was kidnapping people en masse. 

The entity was very similar to those of Japanese folklore, called "YÅ«rei", but a few major differences, was that it had a completely void face, pitch black. And it was more "amorphous" than it was humanoid, it didn't have visible feet or hands, and it's white, broken clothing flowed in the air, as it preferred floating, but it had been seen walking and even running. 

It also had significantly large claws, which it would use to drag people out of their beds, and take them to who knows where. But I still recall watching a video, showing the entity stalk and attempt to wake up one of its victims. I never got to see the end of the video, but the takeaway, was that you had to keep your eyes shut and not look at it. Because as soon as you did, it would be game over. 

After this sequence, I was taken abruptly to another dream, where I was coddling a child, probably myself or a "son" of sorts. I was telling him that he needed to do, was keep his eyes closed, no matter how scary the monster seemed. And that no matter what, he'd be safe from anything as long as he did. 

But, after just a few seconds, I'm suddenly awoken from my dream, I hear very loud and fast footsteps heading to me, I closed my eyes, still remembering my dream vividly. And suddenly, I'm barraged by an extremely loud, blood curdling scream of a woman. The scream would change direction, as I assumed the "entity" was doing something similar to what I saw in the video, floating around, as a way to overwhelm me. This continued for several minutes, the screams never lowered. But after those minutes passed, I fell asleep again, and woke up normally. 

I was so relieved that everything was simply a dream. As I woke up fairly shaken up, I was more awake than I had been in several months. But I again, was glad that nothing I had experienced was "real". 

But my mood changed a little when I started feeling itchy. I looked at my abdomen, and noticed huge claw marks on me. As soon as I noticed them, my nerves kicked in and I started to feel a world of pain.

It did stop after half an hour. But fortunately, none of this interfered in my sleep and since then, I haven't had any issues with sleep paralysis or EHS. 

I can assume and reassure myself that it was simply a dream. But those claw marks tell me a different story.
