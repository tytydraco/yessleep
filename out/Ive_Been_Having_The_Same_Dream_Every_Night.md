When I tell people I grew up in a cult, they always have questions.

“What was it like?”  
 “What did they believe in?”  
 “Why would you ever join that?”

But to be honest, I don’t remember anything about it. At least I thought I didn’t. 

I don’t like to think about my childhood. My dad was never in the picture, and my mother died when I was young. I don’t remember much about her, but I remember she was kind. She would sing a song to me every night when I went to sleep. I never knew where the song came from since I hadn’t heard it before, but it made me feel comfortable.

I was never told how she died, just that she was in an accident, and I was sent off to live with my grandparents. I had a normal life with them, but whenever I asked about my mother, they would get quiet. I learned to stop asking and eventually stopped thinking about her.

I like to think I did well in life. I got a job in IT, I have an okay apartment in Pittsburgh, and I am relatively happy. I haven’t thought about my childhood in a long time. I think it’s better to leave that in the past and focus on what I’m doing now, but recently I haven’t been able to stop thinking about what happened to me.

For the past few nights, I’ve been having these dreams. I’m not usually someone who even remembers their dreams, but for some reason, these ones have stuck with me. Everything in it feels so familiar and vivid, yet it can’t possibly be something from my memory. Every night when I sleep, I’m put in the same exact room.

I’m about five years old in a room filled with purple light, like standing in one of those clubs with black lights on. And like those clubs, there is deafening music playing. Though instead of sharp club music, it’s a soothing melody.

It’s the one my mom used to sing. But it’s not her singing. The music comes from a chorus of people standing around the room. Like something out of a fantasy book, they dress in cloaks of fur, flowers, and horns. They all sing in unison, in a cacophony of different tones and pitches.

When my mom sang to me, it would be a soft hum that made me feel safe. In the room, they sing in a language I don’t understand. No one seems to notice that I am there. They are crowded around the center of the room dancing in a way I’ve never seen. Their bodies swing as they throw themselves about like a drunk man swatting at bees. There is no rhythm or coordination in their movements, at least none I can see.

I’m so small I can’t seem to see what they’re dancing around, and I’m not sure that I want to. My feet drag me against my will as I walk closer to the center.

Then I wake up.

This has been happening every night for the past week and every night I am getting closer to the center. I always believed that I didn’t remember my time in the cult, but what if this is some dark repressed memory, creeping to the surface. But why now? I am 24 years old, and I left when I was 5. Why after 19 years would these memories come back unprompted, and in my sleep?

I have to find out what’s happening to me.

I opened Google on my phone and came to a blank. What am I supposed to search, *“I may be having dreams about my childhood cult”?* Maybe WebMD has a tab for 'Recurring cult dreams and possible memory loss'. Spoiler alert: it doesn't.

It would help if I remembered what it was called or anything about it, but I simply can’t. I searched *“cults in the Pittsburgh area active in the last 20 years.”* To nobody’s surprise there weren’t many results, but I decided to look through them anyway.

I looked through about 10 different news reports and poorly designed websites before I stopped dead in my tracks.

**“Police Raid Ends in Fire in Apparent Mass Suicide”**

A news article from around 19 years ago talking about a raid on a church. This news alone was shocking considering I hadn’t heard of this before but the photo from the article is what truly shook me.

It was a picture of the members of the cult lined up like a family reunion photo. In the front sitting on the ground was my mother. In the background was a symbol that looked like an acorn floating above a forest.

I don’t have the clearest picture of her in my head, but the pictures I was able to find of her from family friends filled out the rest. This was her.

The article said that the cult’s name was **“The Seeds of The Forest,”** and about 19 years ago they were raided by police. They had committed child abuse, murder, and human sacrifice.

How could the sweet woman I remember raise her child in a place like this? Let alone pose for a picture with the psychopaths like they were best buddies at summer camp.

I scrolled down to the end of the article and somehow felt sicker than before. As the police arrived at the scene the building was engulfed in flames. The officers on the scene reported that the only sound they could hear above the roaring fire was the mad laughter from within. Screams of agony mixed with joyful laughter as the building collapsed on itself.

They were not able to recover anything from the church but were able to identify those who had died. My mother’s name was the first on the list.

I looked down at the clock on my computer and saw that I had been reading for about two hours, and it was well past midnight. With everything I learned I just felt like shutting down and lying in bed.

As I laid there trying to remember the cult I was raised in, I drifted off to sleep.

The music started again just like every night, a terrifying melody that chilled me to my core. As I looked around the room, I saw the faces from the photo I had seen. The hollow smiles I had seen from the article were replaced with faces of pure euphoria.

As they swung their bodies violently around the room, I began to walk to the center. Everything in my body told me I shouldn’t be doing this.

Slowly I approached the mass of people in the center. As I got closer, they parted like the Red Sea, and I was Moses.

The music was so loud now that I could barely think. In a daze, I drifted to the center and when I looked up, I jolted awake.

It was 8 AM and I knew that I wouldn’t be able to fall back asleep anytime soon. Since it was a Saturday morning and I had nothing to distract myself with, I found myself getting back on my computer.

I found a different article about the church fire that read: “Cult Fire Kids Finally Found.” If I wasn’t so entranced in what that could mean, I would really appreciate the wittiness of the title.

The article talked about how 12 children went missing after the church fire. They were the kids of the members of the cult and were never found in the rubble of the fire. They were eventually all found together in the woods with no recollection of what had happened.

A list of names was put below a picture of the children and I immediately felt like I couldn’t breathe.

There it was. First name, bold as the headline.  
 **Mine.**

How could someone forget that they escaped a mass suicide and then got lost in the woods? I’m learning more and more about the uselessness of human memory.

The rest of the names didn’t ring any bells except for the last one.  
 **Eli Mangone.**

The name seemed familiar, but I couldn’t remember why. I paced around my apartment thinking about what I had just read when it came to me.

Eli was my roommate for half a semester in college.

Maybe it was just *my* memory that was useless.

I remembered he lived in Shady Side a few years ago and figured that was the best place to start looking.

I raced through the city in my tiny sedan, almost hitting about three pedestrians, but I couldn’t focus on that. All I could think about was getting answers.

As I got to the house, I saw “Mangone” posted above the front door. That was a good sign at least. The outside of the house was well-kept. An expensive car in the driveway, trimmed hedges, and a fancy mailbox overflowing with magazines and envelopes.

I knocked on the door and waited. After several minutes with no answer, I knocked a few more times.  
 Nothing.

Out of curiosity I tried the doorknob, and the door swung open with ease. I am not usually the type of person to break and enter unannounced, but I felt like the situation called for it.

Entering the house, I felt the cool air hit my face.

I called out, “Hello… Eli?” but there was no answer.

I entered the living room and looked around. It seemed like a perfectly normal apartment, so why couldn’t I shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.

There was a smell in the air that I couldn’t place. It smelled sour with a hint of decay, and it got stronger the closer I walked to the kitchen.

As I opened the kitchen door, the smell punched me in the face. There was fruit on the counter that had all rotted, along with a steak that had spoiled too. Someone wouldn’t just leave this out, but it looked like Eli hadn’t gone anywhere.

I decided to go upstairs and start looking for clues.

I started in the bedroom where I saw that his bed was unmade, and no clothes were missing from his drawers. I walked into the bathroom and noticed nothing unusual.

There was one last room in the house that I hadn’t checked and that was his office upstairs.

On first glance the room didn’t seem out of place at all. There was a nice wooden desk with a computer and a leather journal on it. I decided to check his journal for any reason for his disappearance.

The journal entries were normal at first.

“4/10: Been feeling off lately. Maybe it’s just the new job stress. Found this old journal while unpacking—thought I’d start writing again. Could help.”

But they slowly became more off-putting.

“4/12: I had the weirdest dream last night. I was in some purple room with loud music playing. It seemed familiar but terrifying at the same time. I don’t know why.”

As I read on my heart started to race.

“4/18: The same dream for a week straight. I don’t know what’s happening, but it is freaking me out.”

I continued.

“4/21: I will never forget what I saw in the center of that room. She was so twisted and deformed. I can’t let myself fall asleep again.”

“4/22: The music is so sweet, I think tonight they’ll finally let me go to her.”

I fainted.

The light was almost blinding this time. The music seemed louder than ever before.

The hooded figures were throwing themselves so hard I thought I was in a mosh pit for a second. But I remembered exactly where I was.

Slowly approaching the center of the room as they parted for me.

When I reached the center my heart dropped.

There was a woman, strung up with her arms jutting out towards me. Her body twisted and mangled, but all I could see were her eyes.

They reminded me of the eyes of a fish that had washed ashore in the hot sun. The decay of her body left her skin stretched back, exposing every detail. On her chest there was something burned into her skin.

It was that symbol from the picture. The acorn above the trees.

She reached out towards me, and I knew I had to walk forwards.

I woke up in a cold sweat, standing in the middle of Eli’s office.

What happened?

I’ve never sleepwalked in my life, so why was I standing in the middle of this room?

I ran back over to the desk. There were no more entries in the journal.

There has to be more about what is going on.

Anger welled inside me to the point I threw the journal across the room. As it landed, a small sticky note fell out.

I walked over to inspect it and saw there was writing.  
 **“Gena Wilkins, 117 Solway St.”**

With no other clues to go off of, I left the house, got into my car, and drove to the address.

I pulled in front of the house and was met with a run down, two-story suburban home. The house looked like it had once tried to be a home but forgot how.

The blue siding had faded to a lifeless gray, and the porch sagged like it was tired of holding itself up.

Wind chimes made of bones—or something close enough—tinkled softly by the door.

I walked up the cracked sidewalk and knocked on the peeling front door.

After a second knock, I heard the sound of feet shuffling closer from behind the door.

It creaked open to reveal a small, frail woman staring at me.  
 “Who are you?” she said.

Her voice had a sweetness to it that made me feel comforted.

Not knowing what to say, I decided to play it safe.  
 “My friend Eli is missing and his notes said that he visited you not long ago.”

She looked at me in silence for so long I thought about just backing away and leaving.

Just as I was about to turn, she said,  
 “Come in.”

“Let me make you some tea,” she offered.  
 “No thanks, I don’t want to take up too much of your time,” I said.

But she insisted and shuffled off to the kitchen.

I found my way to the couch in the center of the room and sat down.

Inside, the air was thick and wrong, like silence that had been sitting too long.

The curtains filtered sunlight into a pale, sickly yellow that made your skin itch.

Dried flowers lined the walls in cracked glass frames, arranged too carefully to be casual. Some looked like they were bleeding.

The furniture set about the room didn’t match. The couch I sat on felt stiff and was stained from years of use.

The rug below my feet with dizzying patterns made your eyes twitch if you stared too long.

There were pictures on every wall. Some of the forest, some of flowers. Some showed symbols that felt disturbingly familiar, like you’d seen them once in a nightmare.

It didn’t feel abandoned—but as close as you can get.

Gena hobbled back into the room with two cups of tea. She placed the first in front of me and took hers to a chair off to the side of the room.

“I know why you’re here.” The sweetness in her voice was gone. “You want to know about the Seeds... don’t you?”

My mouth felt dry immediately and I had to take a sip of the tea. It was flavorless, like warm water.

“Your friend came in here yesterday and had so many questions.” she sighed.

“How do you know about the cult?” I asked in disbelief.

“Because I was a part of it. A very long time ago.”

“What?” I sat there staring at her with my mouth open.

“You should close that before a fly finds its way in there,” she chuckled. I didn’t doubt it in this place.

“I was a member of the group many years ago, but I left about 3 years before the incident took place.” She looked at the ground. “I didn’t know that it would end the way it did.”

I had to find out. “What do you know about the dreams?” I demanded.

She looked at me startled for a moment before speaking in a calm tone. “Your friend had the same question. They aren’t exactly dreams. They’re memories.”

I fell back into the couch. “You mean these things actually happened to me? The dancing, the music, the fucking disfigured corpse!?”

Her tone changed to something more serious than before.

“It was their ritual.” She looked at me like she was trying to find the words. “The Seeds have been around for thousands of years. They have gone through many different names, and many different ages.”

“The Seeds survive not by legacy, but by seeded memory. The young ones are hypnotized through ritual—music, lights, symbols—so deeply they carry the group with them. They are the true seeds. When the time is right, they return. Death doesn’t stop it. It simply waits.”

She looked directly into my eyes.

“You were made to come back. They all are. It’s in your blood. In your dreams.”

I jumped up off the couch. Everything became dizzy and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I fell to my knees. Everything was so blurry I felt like I was blind.

And the music came back. But it was different. It was in the room.

I looked up and she was slowly creeping towards me.

It was her.

She was humming the music like a bird singing in the morning. She put her hand on my back.

“It’s time to return. Just like your friend did.”

I tried to fight the drowsiness building in me. I looked around the room for anything to help. All I saw were those pictures on the walls. I finally realized where I had seen that symbol before. The music was so calming I couldn’t fight anymore. I was so tired.

The music followed me into the room. The light baked the room in a beautiful purple glow. It reminded me of a sunset on a summer night.

I glided closer to the center of the room. Everyone around me looked so excited.

I finally get to be one of them.

They danced and swayed around me as I walked closer to the center.

Finally, our eyes met and I stopped.

Those bright blue eyes looked into mine and I felt joy swell up inside.

“Come to mama, baby.”

She held her arms out to me and I knew it was all I wanted in the world.

I walked closer and she embraced me. Her arms felt like a warm blanket wrapped around me on a cold night.

I’m finally home.
