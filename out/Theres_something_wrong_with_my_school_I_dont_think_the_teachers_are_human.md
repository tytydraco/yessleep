“Hello?”

My head hurt. It felt like I was listening to a thousand jackhammers at the same time. I tried opening my eyes but it was like they were glued shut.

“Hello? Is anyone there?”

There was something heavy on my arms and when I tried to pull it was like I was dragging a weight behind me. Was I tied up perhaps?

“Hello??”

“Yeah?” I whispered, but my voice was dry and my throat was parched. I fought against the ropes but it was no use. I was losing.

“Thank god. At least *someone’s* alive.”

The voice sounded surprisingly calm. I heard squishy footsteps walking towards me. I tried to scream but all that came out were quick, breathless gasps.

“Dude, hold still! Don’t you want to be free or not?”

They coughed, and something slimy landed on my arm and began to work on the ropes. I heard a sizzle as the ropes melted away and then I was free.

I tried to thank him but instead, I toppled forward and crashed on the ground with my nose.

“Steady now.”

Strong hands held me up and forced a  straw through my lips. I bit down hard on the plastic and began to suck. Water gushed down my throat. It felt oddly refreshing.

“Are you okay? Can you walk?”

I peeled my eyes open to find a vague silhouette waving like a palm tree, then my vision cleared and I realised it was just a boy. But he wasn’t a normal boy.

He was slightly younger than me, about ten or eleven, but his skin was like paper, thin and yellowed and full of wrinkles. His eyes were hollow and framed with shadows, and every so often a fly would emerge and make a trip around the room and out the door. Leeches poked out of the edges of his threadbare shirt in all sorts of different colours.

In short, this boy was a walking skeleton.

My eyes went wide. The boy looked behind him in a panic, then clamped a hand over my mouth.

“Quiet!” he hissed. “You don’t want *them* to hear you!”

“What?” I choked out.

“The things here. Then, the—what do you humans call them again? The people who show you how to write and do magic with numbers and maps and stuff like that?”

“Teachers?”

“Yeah, teachers!” The boy was talking quickly now, leading me to the door. “Here’s the thing, you **don’t** want them to catch you, all right? Because if they do, they’ll do really bad things to you!”

The boy shivered as if he still felt whatever the teachers had done to him down to his very bones. Then he shook his head and looked directly at me. Flies flew out of both eye sockets and hovered around my face.

“The main door is over there.” The boy stuck out a skeletal arm and pointed to an empty wall in the room we just came from. “Except on the ground floor. Reach the door by exactly sunrise and you can get out of here.”

“And please if you do get out…”

His voice crackled like dried leaves. “Send help for the rest of us…”

Then:

“They’re coming.”

I listened, but all I heard was the wind whistling through empty halls. “What?”

“They’re coming!” The boy’s voice rose into a shrill scream. He glanced behind me, bullets of sweat raining down his face, then scurried quickly back to the room.

“Wait!” I called as the door began to close. “What’s your name?”

The boy thought for a moment. “Burton,” he answered finally. “Now go!”

The door slammed shut.

A couple of moments later I saw an odd shadow floating down the hallway and realised what Burton meant. It was impossible to describe exactly what the shadow looked like. It was inorganic, always shifting, and resembled a tsunami sloshing its way through the ocean and striding towards the beach.

Without thinking I yanked open the door and hid behind it. I held my breath, and watched as the inorganic shadow passed by. I turned around to ask Burton for guidance but he had disappeared.

I wasn’t sure what to do now. How would I reach the main door at sunrise? How would I even evade those ‘teachers’, as Burton called them? Even looking down the corridor as Burton and I were talking I saw nothing but twisty corridors and no signs. I would get hopelessly lost if I wasn’t careful and I would miss my chance to escape.

I needed to think. I sat outside the door, cleared my mind and counted to ten.

*Okay. The door is on the ground floor.*

I closed my eyes and breathed deeply, plotting an imaginary door to the bottom of my mind.

*I am not on the ground floor. Burton said so.*

*Therefore, to estimate what floor I am on and how many stairs I have to go down, I must find a window.*

The halls were quiet when I opened the door again, and my meek footsteps echoed down the corridors. It was surprisingly clean, well-maintained--but the iron pipes were rusty and falling apart. Paint peeled off the walls and lay in neat dust piles at my feet.

The first couple of doors were locked but the fifth one wasn’t. It groaned with rust as I twisted the doorknob, but eventually, it gave way and I went in. I grinned, barely hiding my joy.

I was in a room filled with refrigerators. I shivered; the cold seeped through my skin and bit my nerves raw. I made my way through the rows, trying to find a window. 

The refrigerators rattled and shook and screamed. The doors bulged into a curve.

A shiver ran up my spine— and it wasn’t from the cold.

*Food can’t move. That’s why it’s food.*

That did not make me feel any better.

Thankfully there was a window on the far side of the room. I pushed open the blinds and glanced outside.

It was a dizzying drop. I estimated that we were on the tenth floor or so. It was a moonless, starless night in the heart of a sleeping city full of offices with their lights gone dark. Even now I knew it was the middle of the witches’ hour, and help would not arrive any time soon.

*Creak…bloop*

It was the refrigerators again. I tried not to look, focusing only on the view outside. *Food can’t move…food can’t move…*

Then something grabbed my leg. I could not take it any longer. I turned around.

The refrigerator was thrust wide open, its pristine metallic doors swinging from its hinges. A thick substance was gushing out of the fridge and creeping across the floor and under the refrigerators and tables, and now it was slowly rising up to my ankles. The substance opened up into a flower into a wizened claw, and by the dim street lights outside I could vaguely guess what it was.

*Blood.*

It took all my courage not to jump out the window screaming.

*Living blood.*

I thought of the door leading back to the corridor and grit my teeth. I *had* to do this.

It was like wading through mud. The blood fought, shoved me backwards, and a couple of times I almost fell over to be swallowed by the rising pool of blood. It was up to my chest now, and threatening to rise over my head; and already the blood around my legs and ankles were starting to harden. 

My throat was closing up, and a tight rubber band was squeezing around my chest. I was running out of time.

*There!*

I grappled the fuzzy rectangle in front of me, yanked it open, then threw myself out of it. I coughed, sputtered out the rest of the blood, then took in the fresh air of the musty corridor, refreshing and sweet. Then with renewed strength I shoved the door shut.

Behind the door I heard the living blood subside, not wanting to chase me out of its room. I breathed a sigh of relief.

*Okay,* I thought. *Next stop, stairs.*

That was easier to find. It was located at the end of the corridor, like all office buildings. They swirled down and down into a soft, cascading darkness that met them at the end. 

I swallowed and started walking down the stairs, counting the levels as I went.

*Nine*

Behind the door I heard what sounded like wailing babies. They choked, thrashed against their cots, and then it went silent again. I shuddered, pushing away any thoughts of what was going on on the ninth floor.

*Eight*

*Seven*

*Six*

A bloodcurdling howl rang out through the stairs and I froze. Did the teachers, who Burton warned about so much, finally find out where I was? I saw the inorganic shadow squeeze underneath the door and out again, passing over my shoes, and my toes froze into ice.

*They’ll find out you’re here eventually. Move.*

*Five*

I dared not count out loud anymore, only looked at the signs. But without my voice to comfort me there was only cold silence waving through and around me like a shadow, and my heart thudding into my ears like a drum.

*Four*

*Three…*

“Help…”

She cried out from behind the door, meek as a little lamb, soft as a little kitten. Once again I froze, my leg hovering on the first step that would take me down the final few floors. I wondered if, for the sake of my own safety, I should ignore her and focus on my plan of locating the main door by sunrise without anyone slowing me down. Besides, after the room with the living blood, I didn’t want to enter any more of the rooms here for more nasty surprises.

But she cried out again, and my resolve broke. I wrenched open the door.

The third floor was identical to the tenth floor, full of confusing corridors and locked doors. The girl screamed again, and I was *running*, through the twisty corridors and past blood stains on the walls, calling out to reassure her I was coming.

Finally, I saw a room with a broken door, although broken was not the right word to describe it. It was more half-chewed, like someone had snapped it up with gigantic jaws and spat it out because they didn’t like the taste. Wooden splinters were everywhere, lying on the floor like broken glass–and some were even lodged into the walls like split arrows.

And there, lying on a bed, was the girl. She looked at me and cried out again, and my heart broke in both terror and sympathy.

This girl was about four years old, max–and could be easily mistaken for someone much younger. Her face was as round and sweet as an orange with freckles and bright blue eyes, and framed with brown, curly hair. 

But that was where her humanity ended.

She had no legs or torso. All that remained of her body was her chest and a pair of mangy arms, attached to her ragdoll head by a nearly-broken neck. The rest of her looked like it was chewed on, perhaps by the same beast that feasted upon the door, and jagged teeth-marks ran around her stomach and under metallic chains that bound her to her bed.

Burton was beside her, struggling to set her free with his leeches. He looked up and nodded at me in greeting, motioning me over to come and help me. But I couldn’t. I was chained to the floor by my own fear, staring at this…this *kid*, moaning, screaming, *crying* until she was choking on her own tears.

*How is she still alive?*

Finally Burton managed to get the chains off her and the girl rolled off the bed and fell to the floor with a thump. 

The girl stopped crying.

Burton ran his papery fingers over her neck.

“She’s dead,” he announced flatly. 

*Was running all the way here for nought?* I couldn’t help but think of this kid’s parents somewhere in this city, and my heart shattered with theirs.

Burton stood up and stretched, cracking his bones one by one.

“You better go,” he advised in that same flat voice. I was surprised at how calm he was. It was like this was another Tuesday for him. “Before they…”

He looked at the door and sniffed. His face fell.

“Oh no…”

The inorganic shadow came first, slipping through the broken door like water, washing over both of us, and I felt the same cold chill as in the room with the living blood, except somehow this was a thousand times worse, turning my blood and my bones into ice. Then the rest of him came in, filling up the room, and then my old home economics teacher from fifth grade gave me a demonic grin.

“Alyssa! How has my favourite student been? Did you enjoy your run tonight?”

It didn’t sound like him at all. It didn’t *look* like him at all. The old Mr. Farrell I knew was a jolly old man with a tweed coat and gold-rimmed glasses, always smiling with his eyes and making you feel really special. But this Mr Farrell had a glare like a cold, dead fish and a smile that didn’t match.

“And Burton! Long time no see! How have *you* been?”

Burton shrank back against the wall, wringing his hands until it was being twisted into knots. His flies flew out of his eye sockets and shot out of the room.

“F-fine,” he gulped.

“Another unlucky one, eh?” Mr Farrell chuckled, rubbing his hands together with glee. “Thanks for another one, Burton, we greatly appreciate your service…” Burton hung his head in shame, and mouthed *I’m sorry* to me. “Alyssa and I would have a ton of fun thanks to you!”

“Right, Alyssa?”

“Uh, yeah,” I found myself saying, and nodded my head a bit too enthusiastically. My palms were wet with sweat. *This was how I was going to die. In the hands of my old home econs teacher.*

“Then follow me please!”

I didn’t have a choice. He had somehow bound me with an invisible rope and was dragging me behind him on the old floors. No matter how hard I resisted, I couldn’t escape. His invisible grip was like iron.

Mr Farrell stopped by a room a few corridors down and shoved me through the door, causing splinters to fly everywhere. One of them made its home in my arm and I screamed.

Mr Farrell chuckled as he pulled it out. “Now, now, Alyssa, we haven’t started yet!”

This room was modelled after a classroom. There was a huge desk and a very fancy chair for the teacher and several smaller desks and chairs for the students. There was a whiteboard with a small cup of markers and a duster hanging from the edge and a simple clock hanging on the wall. On one of the desks was a cup, a trash can, and a basket full of maybe a dozen eggs.

Mr Farrell pointed at that desk and I sat down obediently.

I looked at the clock. It was my first gauge on what time it was all night and it showed that it was 5:35 AM. Burton’s words rang clearly in my mind.

*Reach the front door at exactly sunrise and you’ll be out of here.*

And just like that, I had a plan. 

“Now, Alyssa,” said Mr Farrell. “Here’s what you’re going to do.”

He pointed at the glass. “Crack the eggs in the glass, one by one, and drink them. If you can finish them all without being sick, I’ll let you go free. If not…”

He smiled at me again, and I saw great white fangs grow out of his shining white teeth. I remembered the fate of the girl in the other room and my stomach started doing somersaults.

*Focus. Stick to the plan.*

“Yes, Mr Farrell,” I said instead, and I started cracking eggs into the glass.

Timing was crucial, but every second felt like hours. I kept an eye on the clock as I methodically cracked eggs into the glass and drank them. I could hear the raw whites slosh around my stomach, the yolks floating on top of the stomach juice like little golden moons.

The basket never seemed to empty. I fought not to throw up. Mr Farrell’s grin widened.

*A little bit more…*

5:49. The second hand climbed up the clock.

At 5:49:50, I raised a shaking hand. My head fell on the table with a thump.

“Mr Farrell, may I go to the bathroom?”

For added effect, I threw up on the desk next to me. 

“Certainly,” said Mr Farrell. For the first time all night he smiled with his eyes. The fangs rolled out of his gums. “Down the hallway to the right.”

I did not go to the restroom. Instead I made a beeline for the stairs.

*Two*

*One*

The inorganic shadow crept up the walls and rushed by me on the ceiling. Squishy footsteps sloshed behind me and I heard what sounded like metal lids clanging together. The shadow morphed into claws that threatened to pluck my head off. Despite my stomach making funny noises and the aching pain in my legs, I forced myself to run faster.

*Ground!*

I burst out of the stairs and bolted down the hallway in the direction Burton pointed out on the tenth floor. All I could see though was the usual barrage of walls and doors and twists and turns of corridors, and I wondered if Burton was telling the truth or misdirecting me so that Mr Farrell (or someone worse!) could trap me that easily…

But all of a sudden I heard a groan, and the wall split open into a shimmering rectangle. I could see the sun just poking out of the horizon, overcoming shadow by its light. Gritting my teeth and holding my belly, I sprinted the last few steps and threw myself through it, rolling on the ground.

Almost inexplicably I looked back through the door.

Mr Farrell was just behind me, just as I presumed, his fat face red and hot with sweat. But then the light smacked him directly in the face, and he screamed, cradling his face with his hands. 

“Mr Farrell!!” I found myself yelling.

He was sizzling like burnt sausages and a pungent smell was wafting out of the door as he slowly melted away, and then he was gone. Only a puddle of black blood lay on the floor.

I turned to savour the sunrise, marvelling at how the clouds lit up in red and orange and the softest pink. I collapsed against the wall and closed my eyes.

It was finally over.

***

What happened next was all a blur. 

Someone found me outside the building, dizzy and sick, and called the police, and then the police called a hospital and my parents, and after a brief stay where they patched me up and gave me some antibodies from drinking all those raw eggs they let me go home.

We spent the ride back in silence. I’d told the police about the makeshift school and those demonic teachers that feasted on people’s blood and even about poor Burton, and they looked at me like I was crazy. “That office has never been used because it has no front door,” they said. There is no one there and it certainly is not worth investigating about.

Particularly not teachers from hell.

I would’ve believed it myself. Truth is stranger than fiction, as they say. Yet I spent ages pondering over Burton and Mr Farrell and his fate and the school with no front door. If it really happened, it was just a dream—anything. It did sound like one, after all.

But a couple of months later a rock smashed through my bedroom window and landed on my carpet while I was reading in bed one night. Trying not to step on the shards of glass I picked up the rock.

There was a handwritten note tied to it with pieces of rusty metal chains. The paper looked like it was torn out of an old notebook and it was written in what appeared to be a thick black marker. The handwriting was spidery, the ‘y’ spilled over half the line and it was generally difficult to make out. Still, I squinted at the note the best I could and here was what it said.

**Hey Alyssa (that was what he called you, right?),**

**Thanks to you and so many others who managed to escape and got them to face the light, I am finally free. I can walk the earth again, see the world, you know? I can’t remember doing that in ages.**

**I even learned how to write because I found real teachers who are willing to help me instead of eating me alive!**

**Alyssa, thank you so much. I owe you my life.**

**Burton**

**P.S. I hope I spelt everything right. My new teacher helped me write this note and did something called proofreading on it.** 

I looked out of the window and I saw a small, thin boy with no eyes looking up at me. He smiled at me and waved with his thin, mangly arms. He looked much cleaner and healthier than when I last saw him.

[Then Burton walked down the street, past the street-lamps, and he was gone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimbaKingdom/comments/vpixk6/boo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
