First, just wanna say that every time I tell someone this story IRL, they either laugh HYSTERICALLY or look like the most concerned person I‚Äôve ever seen in my life lmao.

In October of 2019, I had a dream so vivid (due to a TV show I had watched the night before) that I ended up physically jumping through a window in the middle of my sleep. Literally dove through it, breaking the glass and everything.

What‚Äôs wild is that I don‚Äôt even remember being scared. Not at first. In the dream, there was this dam‚Äîlike, a massive concrete dam. It was about to explode, and I was standing too close, like I could literally see the timer counting down. 

I can‚Äôt explain to you how real it felt. I panicked. My instinct was to sprint and dive away from the explosion. My dream self was in full action-hero mode and I just turned, sprinted, and dove away.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: my real body followed through. and I dove through that window like Michael Phelps at the Olympics üòÇ

I woke up pretty much as my body busted through the glass. There wasn‚Äôt even time to process what was happening. One second I was in the dream, the next I was literally FALLING through the air. Then I hit the ground and LUCKILY landed on my back. Still hurt like a son of a bitch and I had to go to the ER, but it could‚Äôve been so much worse. A few inches to the side and I would‚Äôve hit concrete instead of grass.

The scariest part? For the first few seconds, I wasn‚Äôt even sure what was real. I was bleeding, confused, and staring up at my girlfriend who had just watched me dive headfirst through a window in my underwear. And my brain was still catching up, like I half-expected the dream to continue. I didn‚Äôt feel awake. I felt‚Ä¶ displaced.

It is the most wild and insane thing that has ever happened to me. And I‚Äôve had plenty of weird dream moments‚Äîlike talking in my sleep, or acting things out slightly. But this was next level. This was like my brain directed a stunt sequence, and my body said ‚ÄúBet.‚Äù

Since then, I‚Äôve been diving into REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (which is what I have, and it affects less than 0.5% of the GLOBAL population), and it got me thinking about how movies/TV have the power to shape dream scenarios. Our minds don‚Äôt just react‚Äîthey recreate. The episode I watched the night before (Fear the Walking dead, the episode where Nick blows up the dam) was exactly what played out in my dream.

I actually made a short video on my YT channel where I talk through the experience alongside some dream research and how much movies/TV influence what we act out when we sleep.

Curious: Have any of you dreamt something so intense, you acted it out?
