Long has a great evil been kept at bay. Every religion ever thought of by man has a name for him.

He is the one who will come. He is not the deceiver but the son of the deceiver. And he is here. And he is far more cruel. And as of recently he knows who he is.

The stars have been weird and you know it. The weather has been weird and you know it.

And as you read every sentence your heart is sinking, isn't it?

So let me tell you a story. 

A story.

A "story"

Once upon a time there was a young prince who suddenly had to take upon his father's mantle.

He was a drunkard, a womanizer, and in no such place to do so.

A man who had been born from royalty himself had just moved to the lands this newfound king resided over, and he watched it go to shit. 

He had no traditional heir, but he had a daughter after a sacrificial ceremony who he gave all his knowledge to. 

She seduced the prince with her fairness, killed him, and took that throne. 

The sacrifice her father made was with the unholiest of all kinds. She was fair in appearance, but foul.

This began a bloodline, and the kingdom grew and their population welcomed it it instead of enslaving it.

Many generations down the road as they had amassed the most owned land in the earth's history, it came time to pay the debt. 

A man appeared and gave council with the ruler and through treachery and deceit gained his favor.

The man being a servant of the unholiest, performed a ritual on his youngest daughter.

The man was killed shortly thereafter, and the people of the lands began to suspect they were being subjects to an evil.

they rose up and brutally murdered the entire royal family that made them subjects.

Save the girl, for she had been given dominion over men, though she did not know it.

Having no place to go she fled to her greatest grandmother's homeland. The land of the rising sun.

She married a chimney sweeper and off they sailed across the sea to a promising land. 

They lived a humble life. Her eldest daughter was the only one to survive.

She bore a son, far past when she should have and it was kept very hush hush.

For decades the usurpers of the land have sought him out, because there will be real support if he lays claim to the throne. And it is prophesied he will.

One of their families swore they would raise him as their own.

He is awake now. He knows what he is. You do not know him, he is not a politician you hate, or a prominent figure you disagree with.

He will come from nowhere, and the unrest in the west is allowing him to.

Let they who have knowledge know what I speak. Let they be able to recognize him, for like his greatest of grandmothers, he is foul but his appearance is fair. 

There are signs, occurrences all across the world.

This is the story I speak.

The "story".

Please listen.

It is his doing. 

Take a side.

You don't have much time left.
