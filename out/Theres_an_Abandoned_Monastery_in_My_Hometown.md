My name is Tay. When I was 19, I saw something I've spent years trying to forget. A ghost? Maybe. But whatever it was, it changed everything.

I've never said that out loud before. Or typed it, I guess. Fuck, I've never even congealed those thick scrapings of terror in the privacy of my own head let alone outside of it. For the past few years, ever since that night, I've resolutely and completely banished all thoughts about it and if I'd been left to my own devices, I can guarantee it would've faded into some half remembered dream.

And yet, here we are, dear reader. You should be sleeping, but instead, you're up late reading spooky stories. And me? Well, I guess I'm telling one. 

\---

It was after midnight and I was in my second year of uni, majoring in CompSci. I had racked up enough shame at my cretinous drunken behavior that I no longer went out drinking every weekend, but not so much that I'd scared myself into studying hard and not becoming a fucking loser.

To that end, I was smoking pot, eating pizza, and engaging in edgy behaviour on "underground" forums where we gassed each other up and shared scary stories, mysterious happenings, and other conspiracy bullshit.

My eyes were half closed and rimmed with red when sleep finally came for me and as I went to close the browser, I accidentally hit refresh. A new thread popped up immediately, posted just now, and as I read the title, it sent a pleasant shiver down my spine.

"*Someone keeps watching me from the window of the abandoned monastery near my house. Please help*"

Okay, maybe one more before bed I thought. Don't judge me. I had no self-control back then.

That forum went offline years ago, so I don't have the exact text, but this was the gist of it.

OP lived in a small city by global standards, but a reasonable sized one by his home countries. And like most cities of a size, there is at least one old, abandoned place that has a reputation for being dangerous, haunted, or just plain evil. For most adults these places are to be avoided because there are dangerous drunks and junkies lurking about. But to children, these places take on a life all their own.

Throughout every schoolyard in the city, there were stories about the old monastery on the hill. It  looked out over the bay with cracked glass eyes and a broken brick smile. A turret rose on one side with a bell tower atop it, its steeple tall and pointed. Its cross a broken, rusted spike.

Well, OP wasn't a child but he wasn't an adult either. He was sixteen. That wonderfully awkward age where you've got no fucking clue what's going on, and you're just realising, the adults you've been relying on your whole life don't either. So, you do stupid shit. It's a right of passage.

A stupid shit, right of passage.

I don't recall the back of the bus politics that led to this, but OPs best friend (let's call him Derek) and their girlfriend (let's call her Layla) were going to be spending the night in the monastery. They had some beer, a little bit of weed, and a moderately clean mattress that Layla had demanded they drag into the house.

When it came down to it though, Derek dragged the mattress into the house by himself as every single one of his friends stood on the edge of the property, eyes large and breath shallow, lest they break the fragile silence.

One by one, they left and went home as the sun dipped behind the horizon, until finally, OP was the only one left. As he turned and leave, he noticed something. A shadow in the window, below the steeple, high on the belltower. Stopping, he saw the darkness... shift. A feeling of dread fell upon him then, alongside the certainty that something stood high in the bell tower, looking down at him.

Grinning. 

His thoughts went to his friend as his eyes shifted to the large arched doors of the monastery. When his eyes shifted back to the window, nothing was there. The night air felt suddenly thick around him and he brushed the fear away before turning and heading home. Before running away.

By the time he got out of bed the next day, the news had spread around town like wildfire. Derek had killed Layla in a drug and alcohol fueled mental break and been arrested. The same news story you've seen a hundred times before. A moral panic followed, and Derek ended up being carted away to the local asylum.

OP never saw his friend again... But he did see the shadow. 

It's been nearly thirty years since that night and OP still lives in the same house he grew up in. A house with a clear view of an old dilapidated monastery, barely clinging to life, perched on its hill. Every night, as he closes his curtains, he looks out the window at the monastery and senses something, dark and smiling, peering out at him through the night. 

As I read this, the tingling up my spine became more pronounced. This was what I lived for back then - creepy story? Check. Mysterious shadow figures? You know it. Abandoned buildings? Fuck yes, are you kidding me?! But that's not the reason I was getting so excited.

I was excited because I new exactly what monastery he was talking about. Everyone in my hometown did. Everyone had heard about the kid who lost it in the abandoned monastery and murdered his girlfriend - a classic story. It was at that moment, body thrilling with nerves and eyes wide open, that I decided on my own stupid shit right of passage. 

I was going to break into the old monastery.

I know what you're thinking. Trust me, I'm thinking the same thing and I'm the one who did it. Like I said, back then I lived for this crap. I'd actually been to the monastery several times already - it was still common for kids to go there and get drunk, and while everyone had their stories, the most dangerous thing about it was the possibility of a brick falling on you. 

I was just getting into cybersecurity back then and I thought myself a bit of a hacker. I picked up one of my many black hoodies, a set of lockpicks, and a flashlight before heading out into the night.

I walked and watched as the broken facade of the monastery drew nearer. The night seemed to grow heavier with each step, like the shadows themselves were pressing in on me. I had to constantly battle the urge to turn back but for some reason, I had gotten in my head that this was my responsibility. My journey to go on. At least that's how I rationalised it at the time. Looking back, I'm not sure whether it was entirely me calling the shots.

I was huffing and puffing as I reached the top of the alleyway that lead from the parade, up a steep hill, an even steeper flight of steps, and finally to the property of the old monastery. The moon was large and glimmered silver across the bay, the night air holding its breath as I took in the view. 

The monastery looked much as it always had and it struck me then how odd that was. The description from the post had noted that even thirty years ago, it had looked on the verge of falling apart. I remembered something about it being a heritage listed building so it couldn't be torn down but it was too expensive to make safe. There had been several decent earthquakes since then and yet here it stood. Implacable. Enduring.

Crushed beer cans and broken glass littered the small parking lot outside and I realised with a sigh of frustration that the large arched doors were no longer chained but completed boarded up. All the windows too. The other side of the monastery jutted out over the cliff so it's not like I could just shimmy around to the backdoor or anything. There was no way in.

Looking up to the bell tower I waited for something, anything, to happen. A glimmer in the shadow. The growing feeling of being watched. A sinister presence on the breeze. But there was nothing. With a sigh, I decided it wasn't going to be possible without more planning and began descending the stairs. As I reached a fork in the alley, I realised that this side path lead around the foundation of the monastery and as I looked, the hairs on the back of my neck prickled. 

There, in the solid foundation of the monastery, was what looked like a small maintenance door. As I watched, it swung back and forth on protesting hinges. Suddenly, all I wanted was to run home by the shortest route possible, dive into bed, and not think about the monastery or the story ever again.

Instead, I found myself slipping through a crack in the fence and walking under the huge pillars that supported the structure of the monastery above. A padlock lay on the dirt before the door and despite the lack of a breeze, the door swung back and forth, gently clanging each time it hit its frame. 

I didn't notice anything strange at the time but looking back, the decision to enter that door makes very little sense to me. I remember the way my heart was pumping in my chest, every nerve in my body screaming at me to run as I stepped over the threshold and into the inky blackness. The air hit me first, thick and damp. Carrying the stench of rotting wood and mildew. As if the very foundations of the monastery were sick. It clung to my skin like cold sweat. 

Inside the door was a small landing and to my left, a set of narrow, steep stairs that looked like they wouldn't pass a health and safety check. They were solid though and I turned and walked awkwardly to the top. There had once been a door there but it had long rotted away and nothing but a gaping frame looked out into the darkness of the monastery.

The wan light from the door below did nothing up here so I switched my flashlight on and ventured inside. Shadows jumped and shifted as I tread softly through the room. The air was cool, my breath fogging in the night before me as a walked. I wasn't in the monastery proper but in some sort of antechamber. Ancient bed frames with sagging mattresses were scattered about the room and everywhere I turned my light, there was decay and degradation.

As I walked I felt my sense of self returning. I stepped through the only doorway and out into the main hall of the monastery.

It was beautiful. While my nerves were still fraying, the place looked amazing. Debris was cluttered in the corners, broken wood and bricks and glass pushed to the sides. Moonlight filtered in through cracks in the boarded up windows casting an eerie glow from above. Rows and rows of pews, battered and broken, were laid up and down the room like the broken ribs of some once mighty beast.

I could see clearly now so I flicked off the torch and made my way slowly up the aisle, delighting in the terribly beautiful atmosphere. My footfalls echoed, seeming amplified by the complete lack of sound from the outside world. Dust motes danced through the streaks of moonlight and I watched them for a moment as they circulated above, up and up and up, only to disappear into the shadowed arches of the ceiling far above.

It took me a moment to realise what I was looking at. You see, as I said it wasn't uncommon for young people to sneak in and have parties here. When I was younger it was almost a right of passage. I'd been in this monastery before and I had a very clear memory in my head of myself and a friend, lying down and looking up in amazement at the arches of the ceiling. The way they all converged in the centre to support the obscene weight of the roof. The monastery wasn't that big - maybe three stories tall at its highest? 

That's why it was strange that I couldn't see the ceiling at all. 

Despite the rest of the monastery being relatively well lit due to the full moon, from what my eyes were telling me the walls stretched up and up forever, disappearing into the infinite blackness. A trick of the light, I thought, rubbing my eyes. It must be I muttered to myself as the shadows seemed to pulse and grow. Probably time for me to leave I thought as I stood there, watching as the pale light from outside grew dimmer. 

I turned toward the door but something was wrong. My vision blurred for a moment before snapping back into focus... only now, the door seemed impossibly far away. As if I’d walked miles instead of feet. Time felt slippery, stretching out one second and collapsing in on itself the next, leaving me disoriented and unsteady on my feet. As I tried to gather my thoughts, someone began to speak from the pulpit.

My head was swimming now and I couldn't make out the words, like bees buzzing underwater. I strained to look up but could see no one. Fumbling in my pocket, I pulled out my torch and with shaking fingers, clicked it on.

The flash of light that followed could only be described as violent. It threw the stage into stark relief and I could now make out a shape, twisting in the pulpit above me. Its form was barely human, constantly shifting, as if reality itself couldn’t hold onto it. When my flashlight hit it, there was no sound at first, just an overwhelming pressure in my skull. Then came a noise like metal grinding against bone... an unearthly wail filled with a rage so deep it felt ancient.

At about that time I realised I wasn't the only one there. A man, maybe in his late forties, groaned and whimpered as the light flashed across him. His eyes searched for me and I watched as he mouthed the words "Help".

Even if I hadn't been frozen in terror, I'm not sure there's anything I could've done in time. The shadowy figure rippled and as it did, the man began to cry - bright red streaks of blood welled in his eyes and dripped down his face. He coughed, a gurgling sound, before black bile sprayed out of his mouth, and he doubled over.

Something fell from his hand and rolled across the stage, dropping to the floor at my feet. A scrunched up photo of a teenage boy, smiling at the camera, arm draped around a pretty girl. I stared at it, my mind struggling to process what I was seeing. The boy in the picture looked familiar. Realisation hit me like freight train - it was fucking Derek and Layla. Jesus Christ, was the guy vomiting blood the one who had posted on the forum? 

The shadowy figure loomed over him, its shape flickering and distorting like smoke caught in a windstorm. Whatever it was, it wasn't human. The noise grew louder, the sound of a thousand ancient sermons all bleeding into one another, rising to an unbearable hum. The man let out one final gurgling cry before a wet snapping noise echoed through the hall. 

Then everything was silent.

My body betrayed me, every muscle locked in place as if invisible hands were holding me down. I couldn't breathe. My chest felt like it was being crushed under an unbearable weight. My mind screamed at me to run. To do anything. But all I could do was stand there, helpless as terror rooted me to the spot. 

It didn't have eyes. At least, not in any way I could understand. That didn't stop the feeling of its gaze boring into me. The air around me grew cold, a deep sense of dread settling itself in my stomach. 

The figure moved. Slowly at first, but with dreadful purpose. It didn't walk or glide, it was more like the world around it... shifted. Bent in a way that led the figure closer to me. It had barely moved but already I could feel it, an overpowering sense of malice. A certainty that this thing, whatever it was, despised me and meant me harm.

I had to get away from it. Now.

Out of nowhere, a sharp pain shot through my leg. A cramp so sudden and intense that it felt like my muscle was tearing apart. The agony jolted me out of my paralysis like a lightning strike, adrenaline flooding my veins as my body reacted before my mind could catch up. In that instant, whatever force had been holding me faltered. 

I turned toward the door and ran.

Footsteps rang unnaturally through the vast emptiness that now embraced me and with a whimper, I saw the exit was a distant pinprick surrounded by an all-consuming shadow. My breath came in ragged gasps but the distance between me and safety only stretched further away. Behind me, I heard that same low growl, the sound of something ancient and hungry, and it was getting closer.

I didn’t dare look back.

The air grew heavier with each step, like wading through mud. My legs burned with the effort as I pushed myself harder than I ever had before and as I thought I couldn't go any further, that my legs would collapse beneath me, the exit rushed towards me with alarming speed.

It wasn't a graceful exit. My foot caught on something unseen at full speed, sending me tumbling headfirst down those jagged stairs like a ragdoll thrown by an unseen hand. Pain exploded through my body as I felt something crack in my ribs and my ankle twisted with a sickening snap before I exploded through the door at the bottom. I was collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath as sweat poured down my face. For a moment, all I could do was lie there in shock, my mind reeling from what had just happend. 

Then... something shifted behind me. 

I scrambled to my feet and whipped around just in time to see movement inside the doorway. A shadowy figure beyond, watching me. The air outside the door pulsed and rippled but whatever that thing was, it didn't seem like it could leave. 

It lingered at the threshold of the monastery and then... it smiled. That grotesque mockery of a smile, twisting its form into something resembling joy but filled with only emptiness and hate. Hatred for me and hatred for everything that was. I was already backing away slowly when its whispered voice stretched from the door and stung my ears.

"Taylor..." it hissed but by then I had turned and was running. Running down the stairs of the alley and down the hill. Running out onto the Parade and running back towards the city despite the pain that spasmed through my body.

All the while, the monastery loomed behind like a sentinel in the dark. But I never looked back. I spent that night in the emergency room being tended by a young nurse who definitely thought I was lying about falling down a flight of stairs.

"What, did you superman dive down them?" She asked, raising an eyebrow as she wrapped my ankle.

"Something like that," I laughed, wincing as pain shot up my leg.

She shook her head with a smirk but then paused, her brow furrowing as she examined my calf. “Hold on... what’s this?”

“What’s what?” I asked, craning my neck to see what she was looking at.

She gently turned my leg to the side, revealing an odd mark just above my ankle. It was small but unmistakable. A bite mark, bleeding and surrounded by faint bruising.

“Looks like you’ve been bitten by something,” she said slowly, her tone shifting from playful to concerned. “Do you remember getting this?”

I stared at the mark, my mind racing. “No... I don’t,” I muttered, though a cold chill ran down my spine. I remembered the sudden cramp that had jolted me out of my frozen state back in the monastery.

The nurse glanced at me, her expression unreadable. “It doesn’t look like any animal bite I’ve seen. You sure you didn’t notice anything? It almost looks... human.” 

I shook my head, but inside, dread was creeping in. That cramp, it hadn’t felt natural. It had felt wrong, like something had grabbed hold of me. Bitten me.

The nurse finished wrapping my leg and gave me a final once-over before standing up. “Well, keep an eye on it. If it starts swelling or if you feel sick, come back immediately.”

So that's my story.

Why am I telling you this, dear reader, after all this time?

I’d like to say that night changed everything for me, but in truth, it didn’t. It’s amazing how easy it is to push something terrifying into the back of your mind when daylight comes. You tell yourself it was just a bad dream, a trick of the light. You go back to your routine. Back to school. Back to work. And eventually, you even start enjoying spooky stories again. The kind that makes your skin crawl but feel safe because they’re happening to someone else, somewhere far away. 

Then yesterday happened.

It started with a message on one of those old forums I used to frequent. The kind of place where we swapped ghost stories and conspiracy theories late into the night. The message wasn’t from just anyone. It seemed to know everything. It mentioned the OP who had posted about the monastery all those years ago and how they died that night. But it didn’t stop there. The person knew about my medical records, about my broken bones and... something else. They described a bite mark on my leg with eerie precision, down to the exact placement of the wound. The same one I’d convinced myself was nothing more than an injury from my fall.

But deep down, I knew better.

The message said they belong to a group who collect stories like mine. Stories about people who’ve encountered things they can’t explain. But something was wrong. They were being followed, and they needed my help. They sent me an encrypted file with no password, but since then... nothing. No replies. No updates. Just silence.

I’ve been working on cracking the file hash ever since, but I can’t shake the feeling that whatever’s in there... it’s not something I’m ready for.

Until then... has anyone ever heard of the Candlelight Tea Party?
