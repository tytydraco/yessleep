I love my dad so much. He was my hero growing up. I have always liked to watch him fixing up his beautiful trans am firebird, mowing our lawn, or grilling us some great barbecue. He was so good at it. We used to have these big parties and invite all of the neighbors to enjoy some nice BBQ by our pool. He was always helping everyone, going out of his way to make someone's day easier.  He was a very well-known and respected cop in our town. Everybody liked him.



When I was 12, my mom suddenly passed away. She was in a terrible car crash. My dad was devastated. He started to drink every day. He shouted at me and even hit me once when I said something along the lines of "I wish you died instead of Mom." I regret it to this day. The BBQs stopped, the car was left to rot, and our lawn looked like a private forest. I was hurting so bad, but seeing my dad, my hero, like that hurt even more. He was nothing but a shell of the man he once was. Around this time, kids started to go missing in our town. When the people needed him the most, he wasn't there. He let everyone down, which showed by how people looked at us and how they treated us everywhere.



When I was 14, he met Linda. I never liked Linda, and she never liked me. The more my dad got into her, the worse it got. It started with her going to our house once a week, then once every 4 or 5 days, sleeping over. She wouldn't let me go near my dad. She would purposefully do things like spill milk on his laptop or stain his shirts with food, and then she would blame it on me just to get my dad pissed at me and drive us apart. And it worked.



Around 15, my dad and I barely talked. I couldn't even look at him. He married linda a couple of weeks before my 15th birthday and went on a honey moon trip with her, not even calling on my birthday. And I was ok with that, I couldn't stand looking at him, not to mention how much I hated Linda, it was all her fault. I dreamed of getting rid of her every single day.



Then, one night, I heard a loud bang coming from our shed. I was scared and, even though I hated that old piece of shit and the other piece of shit he married, I went to call them. After all, he was still a cop and had a gun. 



I couldn't find them so I grabbed a knife in the kitchen and went to look by myself. When I opened the shed door, I puked everywhere. There was a kid, or what was left of him, strapped to a chair. One eyeball melted into his skull, and the other popped out of its socket, hanging in there and swinging in the wind. His fingers bent in unnatural ways. Multiple bruises, cuts, and burn marks all over his body. I only recognized him because of a small tattoo he had on his hand. He went to high school with me. His nails were all ripped off. But then I heard my dad shout.



I looked to my left and saw him there, lying on his side, with a knife in his leg. He was yelling like crazy that he found out Linda was the serial killer all along, and he tried to stop her, but she stabbed him first. On my right, Linda was kneeling, blood dripping all over her face. She was punched hard. It looks like my dad was able to fight for a while before getting stabbed. His gun was right next to her. She was crying and sobbing and muttering things I couldn't hear because her face had already swelled from the beating.

‘…. protect…. Please…..help…. Kill…. Father….”



I didn't know what to do, but when she reached for the gun, I didn't even think. It was almost a primal instinct. I just stabbed her in the neck. I knew she was guilty, all the things she did to me, to my father, to drive us apart. The disappearances, what better way to get away with murder than marrying a cop and getting to know what the police knew about you?

She looked at me but was not angry. She looked almost like she was… sorry? 



Suddenly, it all hit me hard. My mother's death and the disappearances that started right after it. The killer was always one step ahead of the police, almost like he knew what was happening. All these years, Linda wasn't trying to sabotage my relationship with my father but rather protect me. She must have discovered his secret but was too afraid to do anything. After all, who would believe her? He was, although letting everyone down years back, a very well-known police officer.

“Wrong choice kiddo”

That was the last thing I heard before getting struck in the head. The person I loved the most.

My hero.
