Me again, things have been...hectic, after my last post. Thankfully Warden is still allowing me to write, granted it took some convincing. He didn't "appreciate" how he came off in my previous post. He got upset with me, very, upset. It was easy to tell how pissed he was because he does this...thing, with his eyes. Warden looks like any other guy out there for the most part, totally human, except for when it comes to his eyes. They're not neon red or anything, but when he gets pissed, they change.

I didn't really have a proper word for it until recently, it's pretty similar to something parrots do people call "pinning". Basically, when he's especially upset his pupils get super tiny, like little black grains of sand. It's when I know I'm in deep shit. Whether he can do it the opposite way I don't know, I've never seen him do that anyway. What would that even mean? If his pupils suddenly get super big and fill out his eyes does that mean he's happy? I don't know, I'm still learning so much about whatever he is. I learn a little more every time I'm around him. I didn't notice it when we had our very first altercation, but like I said before, I was pretty distracted.

He just stared with those tiny pin prick pupils. I now know that humans can do that to under certain circumstances, bright light, drugs, all that, however with him it seems to be directly tied to his mood. He stared at me for a little while, then he grabbed me by my hair, it was fast, I didn't have time to react, and I was still reeling from the sudden grab as he was dragging me off, I was in such a panic I wasn't even sure exactly where he was dragging me to. The next thing I knew I was out of my chair, out of my bedroom, and in the kitchen. He never spoke a word the entire time, not that I was trying to speak to him anyway. When he let me go, I just stood there in front of him rubbing at my head where he had been yanking. He seemed as if he was waiting for me to regain my composure. Once I did, he spoke to me rather matter-of-factly just like he always does.

"You shouldn't write about others so callously Alec. It's rude, very unthoughtful. I'm the only one you have. Do you want to push the last person you have away? Do you want to be alone? Do you want to know what it's like to have no help? Do you want to know how it feels to have no one? To be useless? I will help with that, and it will be the last help I offer until you learn how to respect me."

I wasn't entirely sure what he meant by that, but I learned soon enough. The very moment he finished talking, everything disappeared. For a moment I thought maybe he sent me away to some awful vacuum in space, it sounded stupid I know, but given the things he's shown himself to be capable of can you really blame my mind for going in that direction? But, no, that's not what happened. What happened was I had just completely lost my sight. No vision at all. As soon as I came to that realization, I reached up just to confirm that I at least still had eyeballs, I did, thankfully. He spoke again, this time it was a much shorter and simple speech.

"Make me a sandwich."

What? That's really all I could think in that moment. I was completely taken aback; he wanted me to...what? It was one of the few times I actually dared to talk back to him instead of just quietly complying. It was just so strange.

"What? You want me to...make you a sandwich? Why the hell do you want that? Do you even need to eat?"

I waited there quietly in the darkness, hoping he would respond and not be even more upset that I had dared to question him. He did respond, but his response left much to be desired, he simply repeated himself, just a bit slower and more condescending than the previous time emphasizing each word to me as if I had suddenly forgotten English.

"Make. Me. A. Sandwich."

I was still confused, sure, but I wasn't going to dare question him a second time, it was clear I wasn't going to get an answer, so I just complied, or I tried at least. I tried my best to feel around for my countertop, it's a long counter that starts on one wall and wraps around to the other, I slowly shuffled to avoid tripping over anything or ramming my toes into a chair leg somewhere, not daring to lift my socks off of the tile floor, I must have looked like an absolute idiot, I sure felt like one. I managed to place both of my palms on the countertop without incident, then I simply shuffled along it almost like how a child shuffles along the edge of a pool when they can't swim in order to find my bread. My left hand finally smashed into the bag of honey wheat bread I had, and I grabbed it pulling it closer, I fumbled around trying to find that stupid twisty thing the bags have, annoying enough to deal with even with sight let alone now.

I took my sweet time getting two slices of bread out of the bag lightly smashing them in the process, once I had what I needed I shoved the bag back towards the backboard and left the slices there as I continued my shuffling against the counter edge searching for the lip of my kitchen sink, once I felt its metal surface I knew I was almost at the fridge and shuffled myself over to it rubbing my hand up against the cold surface like a drunken pervert trying to feel it up until I at long last found the damn handle. I didn't know what kind of sandwich Warden wanted, he didn't specify and honestly, I doubt this actually had anything to do with hunger or an actual desire for a sandwich, he just wanted to watch me make an ass out of myself. I pulled the fridge open and bent down grabbing around for a few seconds before finding the handle to my meat drawer and opening it up, I rummaged around in there and grabbed what was unmistakably a Tupperware of ham, or turkey, I have both, so I had no clue which it was at the time.

Once I had the square Tupperware of undetermined meat, I held it in one hand as I groped around once more for a bag of cheese, I found that rather quickly thankfully, I shoved the fridge closed and retraced my shuffling along the counter until I once again reached the halfway marker of my sink, I set the bag of cheese on top of the Tupperware of mystery meat and reached around for my knife block, once I made contact I grabbed a knife, couldn't tell which one, and continued my harrowing journey back to my bread on the other side of the kitchen. That was the hardest part of this massive waste of time. At least I thought it was. Assembling the sandwich was easy enough, not my best work, but it was a sandwich, barely.

As soon as I finished sloppily cobbling together what only a newly blind man like me could call a sandwich Warden finally broke the endless awkward silence that I'd been forced to endure throughout this strenuous process with yet another simple command.

"Cut it."

I was all too prepared for this action, I already had the knife, after all. Then I truly thought about it, I'm blind. How am I going to cut this thing without cutting my fingertips off? I wanted to tell him no, that I wasn't going to risk cutting myself for his bruised ego, but I knew that was a bad idea. Disobedience was a bad idea. So, I just did my best, working oh so slowly, gently moving the knife down, trying to get a feel for where the sandwich was and where my hands were. Once I was certain I had my placement right and that my hand would be spared, I made the cut. I began sawing away at the Frankensteined little sandwich, and as I did, I felt an intense, deep stabbing pain, I was so confused. I was one hundred percent positive that my hand was not in the way of my knife, I was positive.

But nothing is so simple with Warden around. No. The instant I began my sawing Warden had swapped the sandwich with my knife. Meaning that now instead of holding a knife as I sawed away at a sandwich, I was instead holding a sandwich as I brought my fist down grinding the back of my hand against the serrated blade. As soon as the pain registered, I screamed out in agony and threw my hand back shaking it frantically before clutching it tightly to my chest curling down to the floor in pain. My hands were both soaked in what I didn't have to guess was blood and I was in pain, lots of it. As I laid there trying not to dare let any tears escape my pain wracked body, my vision returned.

It was blurry with those tears threatening to break free, I could see Warden calmly walking forward until he stood right over me. Warden didn't say a thing, not a single word. He simple reached down and picked up the sandwich which at this point was half stained crimson, as he stood back up, he lifted one of his shoes off of the ground and stepped onto my head keeping me pinned as he took an all too proud bite of his snack. He kept me there until he finished, he didn't even look back down at me, he simply took his shoe off of the side of my face and allowed me to slowly sit up still wracked with the searing pain in my hand. Both of my hands were completely red and there was a large read splotch on my shirt where I had been clutching my hand.

The cut was deep, not deep enough to see bone or anything, but it was deep, nonetheless. I composed myself and scrambled to my feet, I wasn't really sure what I was going to do, I didn't want to go to the hospital, if I did, I'd have to leave right there and then, and my ankle monitor and more importantly the people patrolling it would be none too happy about that. I was about to run into my bathroom, I had a small emergency kit under my sink, I was hoping it would have some gauzes or something to stop the bleeding, but I didn't get the chance to check because as soon as I attempted to pass Warden, he grabbed my wrist, the one of the actively bleeding hand of course. Then he did something I didn't expect.

Granted I never expect anything he does, but this was especially unexpected. He didn't speak, he just stared at me as he pulled my hand closer to his face and held it up as he took one long, slow, repulsive lick of the back of my hand, and the pain was gone. The bleeding and the pain were both gone. My hands were still covered in blood, but I wasn't bleeding anymore. I wasn't cut anymore, it was gone. I had no scar, no evidence of that deep cut ever being there, just a thick trail of skin showing through the mess of blood around it.

I didn't know what to do at that point other than to quickly wipe the back of my newly healed hand against my pant leg. Luckily, I didn't have to think about what to do next because Warden spoke and for once the direction that he gave I agreed with completely.

"Get out of my sight."

Needless to say, some new guidelines have been set in place regarding my journaling. I'm permitted to continue describing the events I've been living through as long as I never under any circumstances describe Warden appearance wise. I can't tell you if he has hair, or if he does what color it is. I can't tell you how tall he is. I can't tell you what his skin looks like. I may have already pushed it a little by stating earlier that his eyes weren't neon red, I'll have to wait and see about that. It seems that as long as he's sure no one is able to identify him he's alright with me describing his various deeds against me as I document my experiences to you all. I suppose it's because he may feel like it won't come back on him in a way.

Why he cares I don't really have an explanation for, other than maybe pure ego. I really don't see why it matters; with everything he seems capable of I wouldn't put the ability to change his form out of the realm of possibilities. I won't question it though; it gives me permission to continue this, so I really don't need to know his whys.

I didn't have much time to calm down after what happened since that was a workday. I barely had enough time to shower the blood off and change clothes, I doubted I'd ever be able to get those stains out, so I just tossed them. By the time I was dressed and had my shoes on I was cutting it so close I had to run out of the door and into my car. The drive to work was quiet. It's only about a fifteen-minute commute, but even that short drive gave me a moment to collect myself. I blasted myself with the A.C and turned up the radio and just breathed. I wish those drives lasted forever. Before Warden showed up and started his tyranny, I hated the drive to work, I hated the roads I had to take, hated the view, the same buildings, every day, reminding me how much closer I was to the job I hated.

These days I practically worship those moments. I treat my heavily driven junker of a car like it's my salvation most days. I treat my dead-end retail job like it's my heaven, because Warden isn't there. Sure, I still have to deal with assholes, and in far greater numbers, but none of them can make me blind in an instant or trick me into slashing myself. Even on days when half of my coworkers are out sick, and I'm left keeping the place running I'm still thankful that I'm not home. Most of my coworkers avoid me like the plague, but I have a small group I get along with well enough. There's Greg, he's an older guy, he's a little crude but he's a good guy most of the time. Then there's Alma, seeing her always makes me feel better, her blonde hair is always in the most beautiful curls, she's roughly the same age as me, but she has way more energy than I do, she's the one the customers flock to nine times out of ten.

Obviously, I can't talk to them about what's going on, not because Warden has specifically forbidden it, it's just, what exactly would I even say? That's probably why he hasn't outright told me not to, he already knows I can't do that.

That day was slow, thankfully. I just spent the whole day stocking the shelves in my department, the food department. I usually like to imagine preparing and eating whatever it is I'm stocking, just the product of a bored mind I guess, but that day all I could think of was the events of that morning. Most thoughts I have these days have something to do with Warden. He's like a disease, and I'm definitely infected.

I'll write more as soon as I get the chance, I would say I'll write more about the things he's done in the past, but, with the recent events I have a feeling he's going to be doing a whole lot to me now more than ever.
