Have you ever tried to pretend like you’re not alone?

Like when objects go missing, you call out something like, *“Hey, whoever took it, please give it back!”* Or when a door slowly creaks open, you say, *“Stop peeping at me.”* Or when you feel like someone's watching, you dance or act silly to throw off whoever, or *whatever*, might be watching?

I used to do that. I *still* do.

A few weeks ago, I was drinking at home with some friends. We were in the living room, singing along to random songs, and getting absolutely hammered.

I left the door to my room open so my cat could come in whenever he felt sleepy. A storm was raging outside, and since my apartment is close to the top floor, the wind up here hits harder than it does below.

The wind howled all night.

At some point, one of my friends noticed my bedroom door creaking open and shut. I scoffed and told her it was probably just the wind. She nodded and went back to singing, but the moment stuck with me. It felt *off*. None of my windows were open. There shouldn’t have been a draft strong enough to move the door.

I thought maybe it was my cat, Max. Short for *Eternamax Eternatus*. Since I haven't seen him in a while..

Since I was the one closest to the door, I got up to check. As I walked, my friend jokingly called out to the “Ghost” to stop. Everyone laughed.

But the closer I got, the more wrong it felt. The creaking had changed, it wasn’t random anymore. It was rhythmic. Intentional. Like something was deliberately bobbing the door back and forth.

I forced a nervous laugh and repeated my friend’s joke. *“O’ spirit of the door, please cease thy movement.”*

Then I swung the door open.

And something *rushed past me*. A gust of air so strong it took my breath away, something had flown by at full speed.

I froze. My smile dropped. My blood went cold.

There, under the bed, a *little girl* was peeking her head out, **upside fcking down**. 

Her little hands clinging to the underside of the bed frame.

Her long hair spilled across the floor like ink, and she had already scuttled under the bed when I opened the door. All I could really see were her eyes.

They were massive. Wide open. Bloodshot. Unblinking.

Her brows were furrowed, and her cheeks creased like she was grinning.

I shut my eyes and screamed. A real, primal, full-body scream.

My friends rushed over, panicked, asking what was wrong.

There was nothing there.

I told them what I saw, but of course, they didn’t believe me. They said it may have just been a combination of stress and alcohol.

I didn’t push it. No matter how many details I gave, no one was going to take me seriously.

Since that night, I haven’t seen her again.

I told the story to my mom, she’s superstitious as hell. She just said, *“Be careful what you believe to be real. Sometimes, that’s all it takes to make them stay.”*

She didn’t recognize the girl from any folktale or legend. But maybe one of you will.

Ever since that night, I stopped mocking the feeling of being watched.  
Now, I just hope… *whatever*’s watching me doesn’t laugh back.

I’ll update if anything happens again.
