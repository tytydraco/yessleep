[\[Part 15\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1hjwyi6/the_call_of_the_breach_part_15/)

I’d never been in the center of Black Oak before the war, but from what I could see, standing next to Andrea on the edge of the square, it had once been beautiful.

Like an ancient temple long forgotten, the crumbled remains of the old courthouse bore carved granite pillars that would have soared into classical archways above the doors, a fountain out front of the vast steps that depicted some Roman goddess pouring water out of a jar with eloquent dignity. Unlike the gray mundane pattern of most modern cities, the streets here changed from the typical asphalt to carefully laid red brick, set in zig-zag patterns and squares that reminded me of pictures I’d seen of Europe. Gardens lined the shattered sidewalks and would have produced veritable plumes of flowers in the springtime. Old wrought iron lampposts stood in a few places where they hadn’t been blown to pieces, formed to look like black trees with their roots burrowed into the pavement, multiple glass shrouds hanging from their branches to house each lightbulb. Shops that ringed the square were of similar old-style construction as the courthouse, a charming mix of American Midwest and Victorian yester-year. All were ruined now, burned, blasted, and gutted by the torrent of shells that only paused for this very occasion. A long line of barbed wire stretched in the distance, thrown up by retreating ELSAR soldiers, and behind this yawned a muddy anti-tank ditch dug by the same, more enemy foxholes and trenches beyond it. Sharp fragments of exploded shells littered the cracked sidewalks, craters were commonplace from the intense artillery fire of the previous days, and spent casings could be seen here and there among the brickwork. One spot on the sidewalk bore a rusty-red stain of blood from some unknown victim of this horrible war, and a ragged American flag hung by one sad grommet on a snapped flagpole of an abandoned shoe store. Everything that had once been green and good was turned to mud, blood, and iron, a violated, broken existence that weighed heavy on my heart.

*Could we even fix it all if we wanted to? How many men would it take to clear this away, how much time? It would be years before this place is beautiful again . . . and never the same.*

Between the enemy lines and our own, a small pop-up camping pavilion had been erected in no-mans-land, with a folding plastic table and some metal chairs under its protective hood. White flags marked it on all corners, and two guards from each army stood on opposite sides of the pavilion, eyeing each other in suspicious silence. I shifted on my feet about fifty yards behind this pavilion, Andrea to my left, Sean in the middle, and Ethan to his left. We had done our best to wash both our uniforms and ourselves so as to look professional, and to convince the enemy that we were far better supplied than they thought. Andrea had been given a spare green uniform jacket from one of the Ark River girls, and I’d scrubbed the mud off my boots for the first time in over a week. Sean had shaved, though Ethan preferred to trim his beard, and I thought to myself that we all looked like we were going to an elaborate funeral.

His breath fogging in the cold air, Sean checked his watch and called the four of us into a small huddle. “Okay, it’s almost time. Remember, you don’t have to respond to anything they say; I’ll do most of the talking, and if they get hostile, play it cool. We’re trying to be diplomatic but strong, so we want to display confidence in our victory. Above all, no sudden movements. I guarantee they’ve got snipers watching just like we do, and if anyone looks like they’re reaching for a hidden weapon, it’s lights out. So be calm, sit still, and with any luck this will all be over soon.”

I glanced over my shoulder to where Lucille looked on from the various others in a building our side occupied, her eyes fixed on Andrea. It had taken a monumental effort to convince the girl not to follow us out, and Andrea had forced Lucille to promise not to point her rifle at the sheriff when he arrived. Dozens of riflemen, and as many machine gunners were hidden within the rubble, ready to back us up if needed. Our artillery waited out of sight behind the lines, the mortar crews and howitzer battery on standby to level what remained of the ruined square at a moment’s notice. The tension in the air could have been cut with a knife, and I debated running to relieve myself behind a pile of rubble one more time.

A column of three hulking gray-painted armored trucks rolled out of the enemy lines and came to a stop not far from the pavilion. Overhead, a helicopter thundered in a high circle, and my enhanced eyesight picked up flashes of movement in the various hollowed-out buildings on the opposite side of the square, more ELSAR troops getting into position same as ours. There were more guns pointed at me than had ever been in my entire life, and all it would take for things to go wrong was one person forgetting to put their safety on.

Warm fingers interlaced with mine for a reassuring squeeze, and the only other person who wasn’t part of our delegation stepped a little closer to me.

“I’ll keep you covered.” Chris glared at the enemy convoy, the muscles in his jaw working back and forth in nervous ticks. “If they make a move, we’ll throw everything we’ve got at them. Just sit tight, and this will all be over soon, okay?”

Wishing I could be so confident of that, I swallowed, and gripped his hand tight before I let him go. “Sure thing.”

A group of soldiers got out of the armored vehicles to form a small line, and four people strode out in front of that line in a small procession. There was a tall, rather fit man with close-shaved gray hair wearing the dress uniform of a high ranking ELSAR officer, with red piping on the trousers and golden buttons on the jacket. I didn’t recognize him, but from how calmly he regarded our lines, not a sign of fear or hesitation in his azure irises, I had no doubt this man was a seasoned fighter. To his left walked another figure in military attire, though she was smaller, thinner, with dark brown hair tied into a practical bun, and wore the green shield patch of the Auxiliary forces on her right shoulder. Crow’s face was a cold, pale expanse of indifference to the destruction around her, and she almost seemed bored at the side of her commander. On the opposite side of the military man came a shorter, but stocky man in a sheriff’s uniform, his face somewhat reddened by the cold, both eyes flicking nervously around at the various empty windows that overlooked the square. He seemed most anxious of them all and wiped his hands twice on his black patrol coat as if to keep the sweat away.

Last of them, but central to the small front that marched toward us, a familiar man in a slate-gray suit and long black trench coat moved with the fluid ease of a tiger in the long grass. A small onyx tiepin in the shape of a black crow fixed his gray tie in place, and his shoes were buffed like ebony mirrors. His hair was combed to perfection, streaks of early silver interspersed with the jet black, and his dark brown eyes fixed on mine the instant he caught sight of me.

*Koranti.*

“Let’s go.” Sean motioned for us to follow, and we trudged forward, the corpse of Black Oak crunching under my boots.

We met at the pavilion, stopping in rigid silence on either side of the folding table, the guards making their own salute to their respective commands before withdrawing. Nothing but mist from the heat of our exhaled breaths moved between us, and I found myself directly across from Crow, the two of us staring at each other with cold disdain.

Sizing up our delegation up with a quick glance, Koranti let an amused smile play at the corner of his mouth and granted me a smug bow of his head. “Miss Brun, so nice to see you again. I must apologize about our hospitality mix-up last time you were here, I’m afraid our security was rather overzealous in their precautions. You’ve already met Captain McGregor?”

At this, Crow’s frown toward me deepened, her coal-black eyes filled with hatred.

“Briefly.” I made a thin, polite smile, fighting the urge to reach for my pistol. We’d left our long guns behind for this, but Sean had insisted we take our sidearms as a show of strength, since we weren’t surrendering by any means. I felt naked without my trusty Type 9, but from this distance, a single shot from my Mauser clone would have done just fine.

Taking the lull in conversation as an opportunity, Sean extended his hand to Koranti. “Sean Hammond.”

Koranti shook his hand with another faux smile, though his eyes bore the same cold gleam that a shark’s might. “George M. Koranti. This is Colonel Fredrick Riken of our High Command, and this is Captain Sarah McGregor of the Auxiliary Division. You already know Sheriff Wurnauw of course.”

Wurnauw fixed Sean with a venomous scowl, and didn’t offer his hand, while Sean also declined to do the same. I’d heard rumors in New Wilderness about Sean’s background, how he used to be a sheriff’s deputy for Barron County, how he’d been branded a terrorist by his boss, Sheriff Wurnauw, for asking too many questions surrounding the strange goings-on related to the Breach. He’d been the one to reveal how the local government wasn’t doing their best to defend the county, but instead keep it in the dark, and for this the sheriff had tried to kill him. Sean had escaped with his life but was forced into exile with the rest of us in New Wilderness, forever hunted by the very people he once called brothers in arms.

Flexing my toes inside my cold boots, I did my best not to let anger get the better of me.

*How can you be so corrupt that you try to murder one of your own men?*

“This is Ethan Sanderson, my second in command.” Ignoring the sheriff as if he were some sort of unwanted child in the company of adults, Sean gestured to Ethan, who did manage to exchange handshakes with all four enemy officials. “And this is Andrea Campbell, chief of operations for the Black Oak Civilian Defense Force.”

Andrea put on a decidedly brighter smile, though hers was just as fake as the rest, and I noticed a rather waspish look on Crow’s face as they shook hands, like the two girls wanted to rip one another apart in fury. Considering what Crow’s men did to any resistance members upon capture, I couldn’t blame Andrea for it.

“Thought I recognized that hair.” Wurnauw grunted, his square jaw clenched in a fragile veneer of restraint. “You’ve come a long way from the county courthouse, Miss Campbell. Shame you had to get mixed up in all this.”

“My parents certainly thought so.” Andrea’s pleasant tone slipped for a moment, and a lethal bitterness gleamed in her ocean blue eyes like dark fire.

Wurnauw said nothing, but I could tell by how both fists balled at his sides that he knew it wasn’t a compliment.

With a vengeful twinkle in his eye from the sheriff’s discomfort, Sean angled his head my way, addressing the rest of the ELSAR delegation. “Lastly, this is Lieutenant Hannah Brun, one of our best scouts.”

I looked to Crow, and just from how her eyes narrowed, I knew there was no point in offering a handshake. Instead, I merely nodded at the rest, not wishing to so much as touch Koranti, and having no more motivation to extend the curtesy to Wurnauw or Riken. These people were responsible for horrible things, atrocities which rang fresh in my mind now that I stood within arm’s reach of them.

With the niceties finally out of the way, everyone sat on the icy folding chairs, even as a light snowfall began over the town around us.

Crow spread a map across the table at Koranti’s nod, and Colonel Riken produced a sheaf of papers along with several ink pens, which he placed between the delegations.

“Before we begin,” Koranti folded both black-leather-gloved hands in front of himself, as though we were in a corporate board meeting in his headquarters. “I’d like to say that I am impressed with your organization’s achievements thus far. To survive not only the anomalies but be able to test our defenses as much as you have, took a not inconsiderable amount of grit.”

Sean made a slight bow with his head. “We try.”

Wurnauw’s already red face turned even more crimson at that, seeming ready to burst from indignation like an overripe tomato, but the sheriff held his tongue.

“However,” Koranti’s face slid into an impassive stare, one that brooked no challenge, and I wondered how much of a nightmare the real ELSAR meetings must be with him in charge. “You’ve wasted valuable time, resources, and most importantly lives, in what should have been a ten-day operation at most. Thousands have died because of your unwillingness to cooperate, and regardless of what we decide here, their blood lies in great part on your hands.”

Growing a frown of her own, Adnrea opened her mouth to respond, but Sean placed a hand on her arm underneath the table to stop her.

“We didn’t want it to come to this.” Sean’s voice was frigid as the midday breeze, unforgiving and sharp, enough to ratchet the tension up even further. “But your people forced our hand. Perhaps if you’d been willing to govern more leniently, we could have worked together. I’d like to think we could reach some level of common ground still.”

Crow rolled her eyes, and I did my best to kill her with a glare.

*You killed Tex. Don’t think I don’t remember. You’re a psychopath if there ever was one.*

Colonel Riken let out a small sigh, as if he wasn’t surprised by the conversation thus far and picked up the sheaf of papers to clear his throat. “In that spirit, we’d like to propose a 72-hour ceasefire, beginning at 17:00 today. During this time, no attempts will be made by either side to pass through the current lines of battle, and no heavy weapons will be fired in the combat zone. Small arms fire will be restricted as well, barring contact with mutants. Medics staff from both sides may cooperate and communicate in order to evacuate wounded; both sides will endeavor to exchange wounded prisoners as they find them. An aid route will be opened in the north of the city that your forces will promise not to shell, and civilians from the north will be allowed to evacuate the combat zone through said route. As a sign of good faith, we are willing to exchange, today, six POWs for six of our own that you hold captive. Are these terms acceptable?”

Sean glanced at us, and then leaned forward on the table with his elbows. “We welcome the prospect of a ceasefire, along with the exchange of prisoners However, before we do more, we have some demands of our own.”

Unwrapping a folded-up bundle of papers from his jacket pocket, he read them aloud, brushing flakes of snow off the paper as he went. “All ELSAR and Auxiliary units will withdraw from Black Oak to the county border and will recognize the sovereign control of Barron County by the coalition forces. A ceasefire will be instated that will last indefinitely, and the airspace over Barron County will be treated as a no-fly zone for ELSAR craft. All radio and/or cellular jamming will cease. Voluntary civilian evacuation out of the zone must be facilitated, and representatives from the coalition must be present at every facet to ensure their safety is guaranteed. ELSAR scientists will share what knowledge they have of the Breach with our own researcher teams and will form a joint task force to resolve the situation that will operate out of Black Oak. Additionally, stocks of fuel, food, water, and medications will be provided as aid convoys throughout the winter to ensure the survival of whatever population remains inside the zone. Machinery, raw materials, and technicians will be provided by ELSAR to help repair Black oak’s infrastructure, city defenses, and public services. ELSAR will also deliver sufficient ammunition, equipment, and weaponry to ensure our containment of the mutants may continue. When all these conditions are met, the coalition government will be willing to enter peace talks with ELSAR leadership in order to end the conflict.”

From where I sat on the end of the table, I couldn’t help but feel a prickle of warm pride at the words. I recognized some of them as Chris’s, familiar to me from many nights sitting up with him in New Wilderness as he worked on drafting a peace deal that could pass the Assembly. He’d come up with everything, a draft for the Constitution, tax reform bills, school levies, all to be kept for the day we somehow took our home back from the invaders. Granted much of it was far more hardline than Chris’s original proposition, but our coalition held the upper hand now, so I figured it couldn’t hurt to shoot for the stars.

*Besides, at this point, it’s not hardline; it’s mandatory if we’re going to keep everyone alive until spring.*

Koranti blinked, and a slight smirk of disbelief pulled at the corners of his mouth. “It seems you’ve misunderstood my intentions here, Mr. Hammond. What you’re offering isn’t a ceasefire, it’s a surrender. Why would we agree to any of that?”

“Because you’re going to get pushed out of Black Oak either way.” Interlocking her own fingers on the table much the same as if she were back at her former job as a clerk, Andrea made a knowing, if smug, grin. “If you could stop us, you would have by now. We’re making advances every day, you can’t hold on for much longer.”

“And what makes you think you can?” Unphased by her confidence, Colonel Riken raised a gray eyebrow. “As you said, winter is coming. That means snow and ice that will have to be removed from roads, it means thousands of starving people who will need food distribution to survive, it means old diseases coming back that will spread like wildfire without proper medicine. Logistics win wars, Miss Campbell, not slogans and armbands. We can lose every block in this city, and it won’t compromise our supply chain.”

“But without Black Oak, you can’t range into the interior.” With an appreciative glance at Andrea, Sean made an indifferent shrug at the colonel. “You need the local airport to ferry supplies, you need the walls to protect your staging areas, and you need access to the locals to get enough manpower to run your operation. You can’t hold Barron County without occupying Black Oak, and while we might have a nasty winter to deal with, you’ll still be bleeding money all that time. Those mercs don’t pay themselves, so eventually, something’s got to give.”

Koranti’s leather-brown irises flashed with a glint of irritation at that, and I had to work extra hard to keep from laughing.

*So, we found your weak spot, eh? Even the richest man in the world hates losing money. I wonder how many millions this place can take from you, Mr. Koranti?*

In the same half second, Koranti recovered his balanced composure, and gave us a toothy smile. “I have more money than you could possibly imagine, Mr. Hammond. The Swiss bank will run out long before I do, and even then, they still owe me quite a lot. Didn’t it ever occur to you that no major government force has come rushing to your aid? No military, no law enforcement, no disaster mitigation agency? Every nation in existence is in debt, massive debt, which means when I tell them to stay away from someplace like this, they do as I ask. No one is coming to save you, not now, not tomorrow, not fifty years down the road.”

“No one except you.” Sean finished for him with a sarcastic half-scowl, and Koranti nodded in false modesty.

“All I wanted from the start was to monitor the situation, collect samples, and shut the Breach down. Yes, my methods seemed drastic, but we at ELSAR have dealt with this sort of thing before, though admittedly in a much weaker variant. If you knew all the times ELSAR has kept a Breach from opening, cut it off at infancy, or shut one down before it could start spewing mutations like yours did, you wouldn’t be sitting on that side of the table. We’re the only ones with the tools to stop this phenomenon, which is why you can push us out all you like, but in the end, you’ll beg for us to come back, on your hands and knees.”

Sean’s face rippled with the fresh doubt sown by Koranti, and for a moment, no one spoke.

I bit the inside of my cheek, and tried not to think about how much Koranti’s words had made sense. Even if we won, Vecitorak was still out there, his deadline for me to come to the Sacred Grove in exchange for Tarren’s life drawing closer by the day. I had no idea what I would do when that time came, how to kill someone who seemed immune to our bullets, or how we could stop the Breach from pumping even more mutants into Barron County than it already had. None of us had any answers for that, and id we couldn’t solve the Breach problem, then it might not matter who controlled Barron County.

*Rodney Cater, Dr. O’Brian, Koranti . . . they were all right, in some way or another. They all knew the truth about this place, knew what had to be done, and I never believed them. Now here we are, at the end of all this, and we don’t even have an answer to their challenge.*

With a cough, Sean cleared his throat and straightened up in his metal folding chair. “So, you reject our terms?”

He snorted in disbelief at Sean’s refusal to back down, and Koranti waved a hand at the papers indifferently. “I’ll lengthen my ceasefire offer to a full week, with the civilian evacuation, and even the no-fly zone for armed aircraft, but that’s it.”

Next to Sean, Ethan folded his beefy arms, having been quiet this far, and shook his head. “No deal.”

“Didn’t ask you, grease monkey.” Wurnauw sneered at him, his patience wearing thin at the stagnant proceedings, the cold weather, and the fact that he was exposed to plenty of people who wouldn’t have hesitated to gun him down.

“No one asked *you*.” I surprised myself for the words that flew out of my mouth and would have blushed if I weren’t already seething.

Crow’s upper lip curled into a vicious smirk. “Looks like they’ve got you trained as a loyal guard dog. Do you let them rub your belly when you’re a good girl? Or are you better on your knees?”

“At least I don’t murder innocent people.” I shot back, face hot with fury at the lies being passed back and forth across the table.

Buoyed by the knowledge she’d gotten under my skin, Crow smiled at last, a wicked cheshire grin that could have rivaled a Puppet’s for the undying hatred laced behind it. “No, you just execute wounded soldiers.”

In my head, I saw again the man’s face, the first one I’d ever killed. He’d been an ELSAR soldier, one who ran at me from the fog in the southlands, and I’d shot him out of accidental reflex. In my naïve horror, I’d tried to save his life, but he bled to death before I could do anything. Crow had seen it all, and something told me she’d known him, perhaps as a friend, judging by the slanted way she framed the incident within her own memory.

*He shot you to save me. Did you remember that too, or conveniently overlook it? Maybe they realized you were a monster before you did, Crow.*

“Thank you, Captain.” His stoic countenance molding not a displeased frown, Colonel Riken fixed Crow with a stern look. “I think we’re almost concluded with the negotiations; why don’t you see to the disposition of the rear? I’ll send for you later.”

If she’d looked at me with hatred before, the expression Crow made at Colonel Riken’s order was nothing short of existential loathing. Something seemed to bubble just under the surface of her eyes, a rage that wanted to explode, but remained trapped for the time being. It seemed the girl was at war with herself, driven by a burning desire to have her own way, and only restrained by the sense to realize she was outgunned in this particular instance.

To my curious surprise, Koranti watched this interaction with his own form of mirth, as if he enjoyed watching the colonel and his subordinate trade barbs. It seemed he didn’t care if fissures emerged in his faction; he either had supreme confidence in his plans, or just didn’t care about the morale of his troops.

*He did hire the Organs. I suppose having tons of money doesn’t guarantee you’re a genius in everything. His HR department must be an absolute hellscape.*

“At once, sir.” With a short huff, Crow jumped to her feet and swept back toward the trucks, never looking back.

Reclining in his chair, Koranti refocused on me, his head cocked to one side. “I must say, Miss Brun, I do regret your early departure from our care. You’ve shown admirable qualities that would be quite useful in our organization. When your inevitable surrender comes, I’m still willing to extend our old agreement if you would like.”

Feeling the eyes of the others on me, I thought back to my imprisonment with ELSAR, of the sinking feeling I’d had in that high rise room, in the dank prison cell beneath their headquarters, of the screams made by the victims of the Organs. To be owned, collared, shackled like an animal, helpless to resist the basest and most depraved whims of my captors was nothing short of slavery, and he knew it. The fact that Koranti could even make such an offer twice with no shame whatsoever made the blood boil in my veins.

*I’m not your property. I never will be. Never.*

Determined not to let him see me squirm, I met Koranti’s predatory gaze and forced my anger to a simmering calm. “I would rather die standing on a mountain of corpses than kneel for someone like you.”

Koranti stared at me for a long few moments, his plastic smile frozen in contemplation, as though he would erupt like some jack-in-the-box at being denied. Part of me was terrified at having told likely the most powerful man I would ever meet ‘no’, but I refused to look away, didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of seeing me tremble.

“The lives of my soldiers aren’t for sale.” Sean leaned forward on the table and aimed a dirty look at Koranti. “I know that’s something a man like you isn’t used to, given how easily you throw away your own men. Add our conditions for non-combat supplies to what you’ve agreed to, along with the infrastructure repair and the release of all prisoners from the internment camp in the northern district, and we have a deal.”

His confidence seemed to come back to life from whatever glitch had overcome it, and Koranti flicked his eyes to Sean, to me, then back to Sean again.

 “Done.” Gathering his black coat around himself, Koranti stood and waved to Wurnauw with a dismissive air. “We’ll be in touch later to sort out the details. Sheriff, see to the exchange and report back to me once it’s over.”

With that, he turned on his heel and walked alongside Colonel Riken back toward the waiting convoy of trucks. The engines roared, and their vehicle rolled back into the safety of their lines, across a bridge made of railroad struts across the anti-tank ditch.

I blinked in shock at the others on our side of the table, and they bore the same stunned expression as I did. Had we really done it, brokered a ceasefire, at long last? True, it wasn’t everything we wanted, not even close, but this meant food, medicine, and aid flowing in from outside. It meant the lights coming back on, the sewers working again, the gas flowing to heat what homes remained. It meant survival, for thousands of innocent people, and for those of us who had faced down the darkness beyond the gates . . . hope.

Left alone with us, Wurnauw looked almost as surprised as we were, but keyed the shoulder-mic for his radio. “Send out the prisoners.”

Rising to my feet, I waited alongside the others as Sean radioed for our side to do the same. It was strange, the sudden change of mood in Koranti. He’d always struck me as a calculating man, careful, not easily swayed. I hadn’t thought he would budge so easily on the ceasefire demands.

*Even Koranti has to have his limits. Maybe we really do have them in a corner. I mean, we got this far, didn’t we?*

Our troops led out a small procession of gray-uniformed men and sent them in a slow march toward the enemy lines. At the same time, a similar group of people in grimy orange jumpsuits were shuffled out of one armored truck from the enemy convoy and began to move our way. They were thin, and even from this far off, I could see the shaved heads, bruises, and dried blood.

“My God.” Andrea covered her mouth with a hand next to me, and I followed her gaze to the last of the prisoners headed our direction.

It was only due to his swarthy complexion that I knew it was Kaba, as almost everyone else in Barron County came from the same Caucasian stock as their forebears. Everything about him looked so much worse, from his swollen face to the hunched way he walked, as if Kaba’s legs hurt to use. Both hands were bandaged in brownish strips of gauze, and I realized he had no fingers left, the knuckles bandaged at the stumps from where they’d been sawn off, one-by-one. His face was inflamed, one eye socket covered in a crude eyepatch which could only mean the eyeball itself was damaged or gone, and both ears had been pared down to cotton-encrusted nubs by some torturer’s blade. His bare feet were bound much like his hands, though from the red marks that had bled through, I could see where someone had taken either a nail or drill bit to his toes. Kaba’s breaths were labored, and it seemed every step was excruciating, enough to pull horrid groans from his cracked lips.

Guilt slashed through my heart, and I remembered the smiling, bright young man who’d cut my tracker out when the resistance saved me from such a fate.

*No one came for you. After everyone you helped to save, all those people you protected, there wasn’t enough time to get you out. Oh Kaba, you deserved so much better.*

Tears running down her white cheeks, Andrea broke from our ranks to run to him as Kaba neared, her words laced with sorrow. “It’s me, Tiger it’s me, it’s Andrea. Come here, lean on me, that’s it. It’s okay, we’ve got you, you’re going to be okay.”

Head down to avoid the faces of the shattered prisoners as he passed them Wurnauw shuffled toward the last armored truck.

His face tinged with disappointment at the pitiful condition of our recovered men, Sean let out a long, sad sigh.  “Let’s get them to medical.”

He stepped forward to help Andrea, one hand out to support Kaba’s other arm, and my eye caught a glint on the third floor of the bombed-out courthouse.

My eyes focused, and I caught a pale face, dark brown hair, and a small patch of green on one shoulder.

Ice rushed through my blood, and I lunged to grab Sean’s uniform sleeve. “Get down!”

*Whoosh.*

I barely had a second to yank him off balance as an object streaked down from the ruins of the courthouse.

*Boom.*

The RPG swept my legs from under me, I lost my grip on Sean, and all of us tumbled to the ground as the square erupted in a storm of gunfire.
