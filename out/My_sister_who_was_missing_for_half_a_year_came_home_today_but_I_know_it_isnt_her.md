My sister went missing 6 months ago.

&#x200B;

The whole town was devastated. She was very popular among the people who lived here, unlike me, the only reason people spoke to me was to attempt to comfort me about my sisters disappearance. Jaida had always been the golden child. She was 3 years younger than me. She was a storybook-beautiful girl with emerald green eyes and long locks of jet black hair. She got straight A's and always fulfilled my parents expectations. I was a scrawny child with greasy brown hair and terrible acne. My parents always told me things like: "You should be more like your sister" and "We're glad Jaida didn't turn out like you". Jaida gave the valedictory speech at her high school, graduated from NYU with a Doctoral degree and became a surgeon. Unlike me, she was very successful. My job doesn't pay me nearly enough, and I still live with my parents. I am 33 years old now.

Jaida would come visit us every weekend. She would tell us about how wonderful her life was and how much she loved her job. I honestly could not stand it. She knew what she was doing, she was practically rubbing it in my face. She would look at my annoyed expression, and you could almost see a smirk forming on her face. It made my blood boil.

&#x200B;

One particular Friday night, about 6 months ago, Jaida came over, she looked pale and had dark eye bags. "Jai, darling, is everything alright?" My mother asked worriedly. Jaida was zoned out, and a few seconds later she snapped back to reality and said, "Oh! I'm alright. I had an all night shift last night, so I'm a bit tired." I knew that was bullshit. She always looked around when she was lying, and her eyes were darting across the room. There was always something different about Jaida, like she knew when something bad was going to happen. This was one of those times. "Why don't you go lie down." Said my mother. Jaida obeyed, and stumbled off into the guest bedroom.

&#x200B;

The next day, she was gone. There was no sign of where she might have went, she left no notes saying she was leaving, she just disappeared. Everyone assumed she just went on a walk or something, until 3 hours later she still hadn't come back. That evening, we filed a missing persons report. A search party was organized, but she wasn't found until 6 months later.

&#x200B;

6 months later.

&#x200B;

There were 3 soft knocks on the front door, almost too quiet to be heard. I thought I was just hearing things, so I ignored it. No one ever knocked on our door, they normally just used the doorbell. But there it was again. 3 knocks, louder this time. I got up to open it, and when I did, my body froze.

&#x200B;

It was Jaida.

&#x200B;

She beamed at me, and hugged me tightly. My parents rushed in, and happy tears streamed down their faces. "Oh honey! We thought we would never see you again!" Cried my father. The neighbors came outside to see what the commotion was about, and soon enough, the whole neighborhood was at our house, welcoming Jaida home. Everyone was exhilarated to have her back, except for me.

&#x200B;

Because I knew damn well this wasn't my sister.

&#x200B;

Of course I would never tell anyone this, they would assume I'm crazy. But I am 100% positive that this woman is not Jaida. You want to know why?

&#x200B;

Because I singlehandedly buried her in the backyard.
