I was the first one in the office, as usual. The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. My mornings were filled with invoices from suppliers like "Bob's Bolts & Widgets" and "Sally's Sawdust & Sundries," and my afternoons were a blur of double-checking expense reports and reconciling petty cash. There were no high-stakes mergers, no million dollar deals. Just a steady stream of small transactions and the comforting certainty that two plus two would always, always equal four. My biggest challenge of the week was usually trying to find the missing five cents from the last delivery order for a new shipment of widgets. I was a cog in a corporate machine, and frankly, I was content with that.

An hour later, other people started trickling in. I didn't look up until I felt a presence. I glanced over my cubicle wall and saw the single HR person we had, Brenda. She was usually a whirlwind of cheerful chaos, and today was no different. She practically sprinted over once she saw me and went for a high five, but she completely whiffed, her hand slapping nothing but air a good foot away from mine. "Morning!" she chirped, her voice a little too loud for nine in the morning on a Tuesday. She readjusted her stance and tried again, and this time our palms made a loud, satisfying smack. "There we go!" she said with a triumphant smile. "How's my favorite numbers guy doing? You hear about the new coffee creamer? It's hazelnut! Can you believe it?"

I muttered a reply about it being a good start to the day, and she nodded vigorously, her curly red hair bouncing with the motion. After a minute or two of this one sided exchange about office supply wonders, she zipped off to her desk, leaving me to my spreadsheets and the faint smell of hazelnut.

A few moments later, I looked up from my monitor and glanced across the room near Brenda’s cubicle, just to see who her next victim was. She was standing perfectly still, her hands clasped behind her back, already staring at me. My heart gave a little jolt. It was a normal thing to look at someone, but her gaze was so intense. I quickly gave her a small smile and a nod. Brenda's face slowly twisted into a mimic of my own. She nodded back, her eyes wide and unblinking, the smile not quite reaching them. It was the sort of smile you’d see on a doll. Her gaze was fixed, unwavering. I quickly looked back down at my screen, the comforting numbers no longer feeling so certain.

A shadow fell over my monitor. I looked up, and Brenda was there, standing right next to my desk. But it wasn't Brenda. The pale face was still there, but the smile had twisted into something ugly, a sneer that showed all of her teeth. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, were fixed on me. And then she lunged. There was no warning, no scream, just the sickening crack of her hand hitting my jaw. I fell backward in my chair, scrambling to get away, but she was on me in a flash. My mug went flying, and hot coffee scalded my leg, but I barely registered the pain. All I could feel was the weight of her body on mine, the smell of hazelnut returning, and the cold, unyielding strength of her hands around my throat. The humming of the lights above me grew louder, higher, until it was the only sound in the world. I clawed at her hands, but they were unyielding, like a vise. The air left my lungs in a final, wheezing gasp, and the edges of my vision started to go gray.

Then, a shout. "Brenda! What are you doing?" It was Gary from marketing. I heard a thud and the scrape of a chair. Another person, Melissa the office admin, was there too. I felt a jarring tug and a brief moment of blessed relief as Brenda's hands were ripped from my throat. I gulped in air, my lungs burning. I lay there, gasping, as Gary and Melissa struggled to hold Brenda back.

Brenda wasn't fighting them, not really. She was limp, her head lolling. Her ugly sneer was gone, replaced by a look of utter bewilderment. When they finally managed to get her a few feet away, she just stood there, her hands clasped together, trembling. Her pale face was now a mask of confusion, her wide eyes darting from me, sprawled on the floor, to the two people holding her.

"Why am I...?" she whispered, her voice small and shaky. "What...?" She looked at her hands, then at me. A wave of understanding seemed to wash over her. Her eyes welled up with tears. "Oh my god... what did I do? I'm so sorry, I don't..."

Melissa was trying to figure out what had just happened, her brow furrowed in confusion, and Gary was helping me up. My neck ached and there were red welts on my throat, but I wasn't really hurt. I was just... shaken. As I stood there, leaning against my desk, watching Brenda, I couldn't bring myself to be angry. The look of genuine horror and remorse on her face was heartbreaking. It was clear she wasn't herself. I knew that if I told them what had really happened, she'd be fired, maybe even arrested. She'd lose everything.

"It's okay," I said, my voice hoarse. "It's a mistake. She just... slipped and fell. It was an accident."

Everyone looked at me like I was crazy, their eyes darting from the fresh marks on my throat to the wild, panicked look on Brenda's face. Gary opened his mouth to protest, but I held his gaze, my stare daring him to contradict me. "She tripped," I insisted, the words feeling foreign and clumsy on my tongue. "Lost her balance. She reached out to grab me so she wouldn't fall, that's all. I'm fine. She's fine." My voice was a little stronger now, a little more convincing. "It was a total accident."

Melissa looked from me to Brenda and back again, her expression slowly shifting from confusion to grudging acceptance. Gary, still supporting me, just shook his head slightly, but he didn't say anything. I wasn't going to be the reason her life was ruined. Not when she had no idea what she'd done. Not when she was more scared than I was.

"I'm fine," I repeated one last time. "Really. It was just an accident."

I finished filling out the incident report, lying through my teeth about the "accident." Melissa and Gary had shot me a few more skeptical looks, but they didn't press the issue. Brenda, tearful and still confused, had been sent home early. The rest of the day was a blur of quiet whispers and pointed glances. I tried to bury myself in my work, but the spreadsheet on my monitor might as well have been a foreign language. The burning on my throat was a constant reminder of what had happened.

Just as I was starting to feel the day might actually end, a shadow fell over my desk. I looked up and saw Franco, the building's oldest janitor. He was a small, wiry guy from somewhere in Eastern Europe, with a perpetually worried expression and a faint accent. He'd been with the company longer than anyone, and we had a weird little friendship based on mutual respect and shared early mornings.

"Ay, my friend," he said, his usual greeting. "You look tired. Too much of this..." He gestured vaguely at the computer screens around us.

I managed a weak smile. "Just a long day, Franco. You know how it is."

"Ah, yes. I know." He leaned on his broom, his small frame looking weary. "My grandson, he is doing this now. All day, in front of the screen. I tell him, 'go outside, feel the sun,' but he says the sun is not in his 'social media feeds.'" He laughed, a dry, rattling sound. "I don't know what this 'feeds' are, but they sound like they are making people fat."

I chuckled. "Tell me about it. We all need to get out more."

"What is this?" he asked, his voice now laced with concern, and he pointed a gnarled finger at the red marks on my throat. "Did you fall? You have a mark like you were fighting with a cat."

I quickly pulled my collar up, a little embarrassed by the attention. "Oh, that?" I said, trying for a casual tone. "Yeah, something like that. I was helping Brenda with something earlier and she tripped. It's nothing."

Franco didn't look convinced, but he didn't press. "Ah, yes," he said, shaking his head. "Office work. So dangerous. First, it is the paper cuts. Then, the fighting with the cats. Maybe you need to get a helmet for the office, my friend. It is a crazy place." He laughed, a dry, rattling sound.

He nodded somberly. "Yes. The world outside, it is still there. Even when the cubicles are not." He gave me a quick smile, a flash of gold in his teeth, then started to move on, his janitor's cart jingling behind him.

I returned to my work, the brief distraction a welcome reprieve. But then I felt the shadow again, and a cold dread filled my stomach. I looked up, and Franco was standing there, his face unreadable. He held  one of the tools he kept on his cart. A small box cutter, its razor sharp blade extended. "Franco?" I asked, my voice a whisper. "What's up?"

His eyes, usually filled with a gentle warmth, were vacant. The friendly crinkles around them were gone. Without a word, he lunged forward, the box cutter a glint of silver in his hand. I tried to pull back, but he was too fast. The first slash caught my forearm, tearing through my cream colored shirt and into my flesh. I screamed, scrambling to get away, but his hand followed, the blade carving another bloody groove in my skin. The pain was immediate and blinding. I kicked out, my chair scraping backward, trying to create distance, but he was on me, his small body an unexpected engine of violence. The blade came down again and again, leaving a burning trail of red. I screamed, a raw sound of terror and agony, as the world dissolved into a sickening mix of bright lights and sharp pain.

I fell backward in my chair, the momentum carrying me away from the slashing blade. My scream echoed through the office, a desperate, animal sound. The pain in my arms was a fire, and I saw bright red lines blossoming on my skin, blood welling up and running down my arms. I scrambled on the floor, trying to put my desk between us. Franco stood there, the box cutter dripping, His face a mix between searing hatred and utter disassociation. Gripping the desk, Franco flung his body over the table, his stained work suit a blur coming at me. His body collided with mine and we tumbled to the ground. I felt the blade find its way into my forearm as he slashed at my throat, my hand instinctually guarding my bruised neck. I grabbed his arm with my other and tried pulling the blade away. He was way stronger than his build would suggest. The force of his one arm was more than my body could fight. The blade inched closer to my neck, the tip poking the skin covering my Adams apple. I looked up at his face, his eyes almost meeting mine, but not quite. His mouth, a tight snarl, reintroducing those gold teeth. His lips moved and his mouth opened, words forming in a wheezy, deep voice; “You don’t be-” before he was pulled away by Gary and Clarence, a dark skinned man who worked in maintenance with Franco. He didn’t fight them. His body went limp and he stumbled back, his face now a mask of utter confusion. His eyes, just moments ago vacant and terrifying, were wide and filled with a frantic panic.

"Wha... no, no, no," he whispered, his hands trembling as he stared at the bloody blade. He looked at me, then down at my arms, and his face crumbled. "What... what have I done?" He dropped the box cutter, and it clattered to the floor. Other coworkers were yelling, someone was on the phone, and Gary was holding a wadded-up jacket to my arm.

The next few hours were a dizzying blur of sirens, bright lights, and the sting of antiseptic. At the hospital, doctors stitched up the cuts on my arms, wrapping them in thick bandages. My boss, a perpetually stressed man named Mr. Henderson, came to see me. He looked more concerned with liability than my well-being, but he granted me a month's medical leave, insisting I take time to rest.

I left the hospital the next day with my arms bandaged and my mind reeling. The cuts weren't too deep, but they hurt like hell, a constant throbbing reminder of the violence. The doctors prescribed some pain medication, but it did little to numb the ache in my heart. The whole thing felt like a nightmare, and for the next two days, I didn't leave my apartment. I binged old movies, ordered pizza, and tried to make sense of the look on Franco's face as he stared at the bloody box cutter, a look of pure, shocking horror.

I kept checking my phone, but Brenda hadn't replied to my Team's message. The little red "unread" icon sat next to her name, a persistent reminder. My inbox, however, was full of messages from concerned coworkers. *You okay, man?* Gary had asked. *I heard what happened. Seriously, are you okay?* Melissa had messaged me with a similar sentiment.

Then there were the theories. Brian from IT messaged me saying he'd heard the building used to be an old sanitarium and was haunted. Melissa sent me a link to an article about a rare mental condition that can cause people to have violent episodes they don't remember. They were crazy, but I had no better answers.

I wanted to call Brenda. To hear her happy voice, to make sure she was okay. But every time I went to dial her number, I hesitated. What would I say? "Hey, Brenda, just checking in after your violent episode and my subsequent attack by the janitor?" It felt ridiculous. I was considering hitting the dial button when my ringtone pierced the silence. “Hello?” I say, putting the phone to my ear. The voice on the other end was a police officer, polite but firm. He introduced himself and said he was calling about the incident at work. They needed me to come down to give a statement about the assault.

I dressed in a long sleeved shirt to hide the bandages, got in my car, and rode in silence, the city lights blurring past. The police station was sterile and smelled of old coffee, much like my office. They led me into a small, windowless room and sat me down opposite a detective with tired eyes.

I told them everything, leaving out no detail. The high-five with Brenda, the blank look in her eyes, my lie to protect her, Franco's sudden, vacant expression, his terrifying attack, the brief moment of clarity, the whispered words: "You don't be-." The detective listened, his expression unreadable, scribbling notes on a pad.

He asked me to repeat parts, to clarify others. He asked about my relationship with Franco. He asked about Franco’s motive. I explained our friendship, and told him Franco's actions made no sense. He seemed to find my answers insufficient, his skepticism clear in the way he looked at me, as if I were holding something back.

After what felt like an eternity, he closed his notebook and leaned forward, his voice a low rumble. "We have to tell you something," he said, and my stomach dropped. "Franco took his own life in his cell yesterday. He was found yesterday morning." The words hit me like a physical blow. Franco, a man who joked about urinal cakes and worried about his grandson. Franco, who had looked at me with such genuine horror after he dropped the box cutter. My mind flashed back to the way his body went limp, the way the terror had returned to his eyes. He had been so confused, so remorseful. He had no idea what he had done. And now he is gone. I felt a wave of nausea, the world swaying around me.

The detective’s gaze was still on me, and he saw the shock on my face. He waited for a moment before continuing, his voice softening just a bit. "There's something else you should know. We got a call from a neighbor yesterday. They found another one of your coworkers. Brenda."

I went cold. The name hung in the air, heavy and silent. The little red "unread" icon on my phone, the unblinking eyes, it all rushed back.

"She was found in her apartment," the detective continued, his voice low. "Same as Franco. She took her own life. We believe it happened around the same time."

“Did they leave a note?” I muttered.

"No note," the officer said, his voice flat. "No reason. People get scared, though. He was an old guy, a foreigner, in a strange place, locked up. Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. And you know, the body count in a place like this is a lot higher than the body count out there." He gestured vaguely toward the street. "Happens all the time."

I walked to my car in a daze, the cold air doing little to clear my head. My arms throbbed beneath the bandages, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the gnawing ache in my gut. What had happened to them? What could have caused two kind, decent people to snap so violently, so completely out of character? The officer's words echoed in my mind: *Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. Happens all the time.* But that didn't feel right. It wasn't an answer. It was just a way to dismiss the horror of it all. I sat in my car, staring at the empty street, my mind a blank of confusion and sorrow. I felt completely, utterly helpless. I had no idea what was going on, or why it had happened, or what I was supposed to do now. All I knew was that two innocent people were gone.

I had just pulled into my apartment complex when my phone buzzed. It was a text from Sarah, a girl I'd been talking to for a few weeks. She was a graphic designer, witty and sarcastic, and a welcome distraction from the spiraling chaos of my life. She wanted to know if I was free to finally get that drink we'd been talking about. I hesitated, looking down at my bandaged arms. The last thing I wanted was to explain the truth. I quickly typed a reply, agreeing to meet for dinner instead, and suggested a place with a patio, so I could wear a jacket without looking suspicious.

The next weekend, I sat across from her at a small table on the patio of an Italian restaurant. The evening air was cool and filled with the scent of garlic and woodfire pizza. A gentle hum of conversation and laughter from the tables around us blended with the city noise, the distant wail of a siren, the rumble of a passing bus, the murmur of a couple walking by. The physical pain in my arms had lessened, but the ache in my heart remained.

Sarah was even more beautiful in person than in her profile picture. She had bright, intelligent eyes and a smile that seemed to light up her entire face. We fell into an easy rhythm of conversation, trading stories about our jobs, our pasts, and our hopes for the future. The weight of the last few days began to lift, replaced by a quiet, simple joy. We talked for hours, the plates of pasta between us growing cold as we laughed and shared. It felt normal. It felt good. For the first time in what felt like a long time, I wasn't thinking about Franco, or Brenda, or the terrified look in their eyes. I was just there, with Sarah, the noise of the city, a comforting blanket of sound around us.

I was laughing at something Sarah said when I saw him. A homeless man, several tables down and across the sidewalk, was weaving through the foot traffic, a crumpled cup in his hand. He was talking to people, asking for spare change, his movements a bit jerky and frantic. My eyes met his for a split second, and I quickly looked away, not wanting the awkwardness to seep into our perfect little bubble. I took a sip of my water, pretending to be engrossed in my conversation with Sarah. The city noise continued around us, a constant, comforting presence.

After a few moments, something made me look back up. The man was no longer moving. He was standing perfectly still, his crumpled cup forgotten at his side, his head tilted slightly to the right. He was staring directly at me, his eyes wide and vacant. The life and desperation that had been in them just moments ago were completely gone. The blank expression, the unblinking gaze, the doll-like stillness, it was the same look I had seen on Brenda's face, the same one I had seen on Franco's. The city noise, which had been so comforting, now felt distant, muted. A cold dread, a familiar one, filled my stomach. I gave a small, nervous smile and a nod, but the man didn't react. He just stood there, staring.

He began walking. Slowly at first, then his pace quickened. He wove through the people on the sidewalk, a single minded missile with no sense of his surroundings. His eyes never left me. Sarah, still laughing, had no idea what was happening behind her. I felt my hands ball into fists under the table, my body tensing. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat of panic. He was getting closer, his gaze unblinking, his face a mask of nothing. He reached the corner and stepped off the curb, crossing the street without looking for traffic.

A sharp blare of a horn, a screech of tires, and then a sickening thud. The homeless man was struck by a black car and tumbled to the asphalt in a broken heap. The world exploded into sound and chaos. The car's alarm wailed. People screamed. Sarah gasped and turned, her hand flying to her mouth. The driver jumped out of his car, yelling. Someone was already on the phone with 911.

The perfect date was over. We paid our bill in a stunned silence and walked away from the commotion. As we said goodbye, a block away from the scene, the pleasant evening we'd shared was overshadowed by the horror. I gave her a weak smile, a silent apology for the way the night had ended. "I'll call you," she said, her voice shaky. I nodded, watching her walk away, and knew she wouldn't. The world, which had felt so normal for a few hours, had once again revealed its jagged, terrifying edges.

After that night, the world felt like a constant threat. Every time I saw someone staring, or acting strangely, my heart would leap into my throat. I stopped going to my usual coffee shop, started taking different routes to the grocery store, and even considered quitting my job, a useless thought since I was on leave. The fear was a living, breathing thing inside me, a parasite feeding on my sanity.

My mind replayed the events, searching for a pattern. Brenda's vacant stare, Franco's empty eyes as he lunged, the homeless man's unblinking gaze as he walked into traffic. The one thing they all had in common was the moment of **eye contact**. I was sure of it. It wasn't some random mental illness or a haunting; it was me. Something about me, something about looking into my eyes, was the trigger. I was the one causing this. It felt like a curse, a twisted form of a disease I was unknowingly spreading.

This new, terrifying belief made the idea of a doctor's visit a whole new level of panic. How could I go to a hospital, a place filled with sick, tired, and vulnerable people, and not make eye contact with someone? The simple act of checking in, or being in the waiting room, or even talking to a nurse felt like a death sentence. But the cuts on my arms were starting to get infected. I had to go.

I chose to go late, hoping to avoid the crowds. The hospital waiting room was eerily quiet, the sterile hum of the air conditioning the only sound. I kept my head down, my gaze fixed on my shoes, occasionally glancing at the worn out magazines on the table. The sunglasses on my face made it hard to see the text. A nurse called my name, and I followed her down a long hallway. We passed a room with its door propped open and I caught a quick glimpse of its occupant. A man, completely wrapped in a white meshy kind of material. My heart skipped a beat, and I accidentally made eye contact. His eyes were soft and unblinking, like his eyelids were stuck to his forehead. I quickly snapped my head down, the sudden motion startling the nurse. 

Once in the exam room, the doctor checked my arms and assured me that I was healing properly. He told me to come back in a couple weeks to get my stitches out. As I walked out, I had to ask, "that man with the bandages, what happened to him?" The doc, with a sad expression, responded, "He was in a fire. Third degree burns over ninety percent of his body. It's a miracle he's still with us." I thanked him and let myself out of the room, walking back the way I came.

I was doing my best to avoid looking at anyone when I heard it. A series of shouts accompanied by a wet, slapping sound. My heart seized, and I turned back. The burned man was already moving down the hall, a twisted marionette in the white mesh. His body was stiff, his movements a jerky, unnatural sprint. Tubes and wires dangled from his arms and chest, bouncing with each step. The flesh around his knees and thighs tore and bled with each stride as his stiff body struggled with the motion. I froze, my feet rooted to the floor. His vacant eyes were fixed on me, a mixture of rage and desperation on his face.

The nurses behind him were shouting, their pleas for help echoing in the empty hall, but they were too far back, their movements no match for the possessed man's impossible speed.

He got to me and lunged, his body too stiff and uncoordinated to land a punch. He missed his target, but instead, his body fell to the side and he bit down on my ribs, tearing into my shirt and peeling a large chunk of skin off my body. The pain was immediate and blinding, a hot, searing agony. I screamed, trying to push him away, but his grip was like a vice. He brought his blood soaked mouth to my ear and whispered, his voice a hateful hiss, “I know what you did.” Tears streamed from his vacant eyes as he spoke, his face a mask of utter agony. Then, he was pulled away, his body writhing and convulsing, the screams sounded like a dying animal, before he collapsed on the floor. His body went limp, his eyes fluttering before going blank. He was dead.

The doctors at the hospital were baffled. They patched up my wound, a gaping tear in my side, and gave me a regimen of antibiotics and painkillers. The police were called, but I had the hospital staff write the whole thing off as a psychotic episode from a dying patient. They had no reason to believe that I was anything but a victim of random violence. 

I went home and locked the door. I didn't answer my phone, and when the food delivery guy knocked, I just stood on the other side of the door, waiting for him to leave. My apartment became my sanctuary, the one place where I could be safe from the vengeful gaze of the world. The days bled into one another, a blur of television screens and the constant ache in my side.

I had been in my apartment for a week, and the walls had started to feel like they were closing in. To distract myself from the throbbing pain in my side and the cold fear in my gut, I turned on the TV. I flipped through the channels, finally settling on a show, a lighthearted sitcom. The familiar laughter from the show's laugh track was a comfort, a small semblance of normalcy in my isolated world.

As I watched, I felt the familiar knot of dread tighten in my stomach. The characters on the screen, a group of friends sitting in a coffee shop, began to act strangely. Their dialogue became nonsensical, their movements jerky and unnatural. Their heads slowly turned, their eyes, once full of life and laughter, now empty and vacant. Their mouths unmoving as they stared directly at me, through the screen.

I gasped, fumbling for the remote, and changed the channel. But it was the same. A documentary about nature, but the animals on screen were frozen, their eyes vacant as they stared out at me. A breaking news report, but the anchors weren't speaking, just staring, their smiles wide and unmoving.

I slammed the TV off, the silence a deafening roar. I picked up my phone, my last lifeline to the outside world. I scrolled through my social media feed, but every photo, every video, every face was empty, vacant, and staring directly at me. I screamed, throwing my phone against the wall. It shattered into a dozen pieces, the screen going black. I was alone, truly alone, and there was nowhere left to hide.

Eventually, the pain in my side started to feel better, but the fear still gnawed at me. The police weren't investigating. I couldn't go to the hospital again. I had no one to talk to. I was alone with this terrible secret. My sick leave was running out, and the landlord had sent me a notice. I had to go back to work.

The thought of going back was terrifying, but the alternative was homelessness, and I knew I couldn't survive on the streets. My savings were running on fumes. The fear was a living, breathing thing, but the need for money was a far more practical, immediate threat.

I was the first one in the office, as usual. The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. I was a human cog in a corporate machine, and I was content with that. I worked on my spreadsheets, the numbers a familiar puzzle. It felt good to be back. It felt normal. I fired away, my fingers flying across the keyboard, the numbers adding up perfectly. The mundane, predictable rhythm of the job was a welcome relief from the chaos of my life. I had been through a lot, but I was still here. I was still alive. And I was going to be okay.

The thought of Franco and Brenda danced in my mind, a brief flicker of sorrow and fear, but I pushed them away. I had to focus. I was back, I was safe, and I was going to survive this. The minutes ticked by, and I lost myself in the spreadsheets, the comforting rhythm of my fingers on the keyboard. It wasn't until the clock on my computer screen hit 11:00 a.m. that I looked up. The office was still silent. No one had shown up yet. A cold dread began to creep back into my heart.

I looked out the window and saw the edges of the glass began to blur, swirling into a distorted vortex of the wall and the outside world. I stumbled back from my desk, my heart pounding, but the room was already starting to melt. The walls swirled, the desks blended into a single, formless mass, and the fluorescent lights stretched and warped like taffy. I heard a door open somewhere down the hall, followed by slow, deliberate footsteps.

I ran, my legs clumsy and numb as the floor dissolved beneath me. I bolted for the men's bathroom, the nearest sanctuary, as the world behind me began to turn to black, a ravenous void eating up the office. I slammed the door shut and fumbled with the lock on a stall, my body trembling with a fear so profound it was almost a physical weight. The world outside the bathroom disappeared with a soft, final sigh, the sudden silence more terrifying than the chaos.

I sat on the toilet, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the world outside a dead, silent space. The bathroom itself felt solid, a small island in an ocean of nothingness. Then, I heard the bathroom door open with a gentle click. A slow, steady set of footsteps echoed in the silent room.

I clamped my hands over my mouth, trying not to make a sound, but my heart was a frantic drum, a rhythm so loud I was sure the entity could hear it. The footsteps stopped in front of my stall. The silence was absolute. My body was a ball of pure, unadulterated terror.

Then, with a sound like shattering glass, the entire room exploded. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, the sink, everything, vaporized into a storm of glittering dust. I wasn't just in the room anymore; I was floating in a vast, empty space. The bathroom and the office and everything else now just a memory. In front of me now, a breathtaking sight. A man's form, but it wasn't a man. It was the universe personified. His body wasn't made of flesh and bone, but of reality itself, a swirling kaleidoscope of stars and galaxies, nebulae and cosmic dust. It was the embodiment of anything and everything, a truly terrifying and beautiful sight. I was utterly baffled, my mind struggling to comprehend the sheer beauty of the being before me. My mouth, without my permission, opened, and one question, one thought, escaped. "What do you want?" I whispered, my voice a pathetic, tiny sound in the vast silence.

The being tilted its head, a galaxy spiraling in the place where its ear would be. It then reached out a hand, and I was lifted by my throat. Its fingers, made of pure light, didn't burn, didn't hurt; they simply held me, my feet dangling in the void. "ATONEMENT," it replied, its voice a chorus of billions of voices, the whisper of stars and the roar of supernovas, the murmur of every human who had ever lived and died.

I was no longer in control of my own mind. Images flooded my consciousness, a terrifying, rapid fire montage of my life. My faulty spreadsheets, the doctored reports, the late night arguments with Alex. I felt the cold, hard satisfaction that had filled me when I learned that the company that we built together had blown up in his face. I was forced to relive the indifference I felt when I heard he had killed his family before killing himself. I saw the text messages he had sent me, a desperate final plea for help, a final, despairing admission that he was blaming himself. "I don't know what I did. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry." The Universe's disembodied voice narrated every single one, its tone a perfect blend of righteous fury and a profound, bone deep sorrow. I watched in agony as the universe exposed the truth of my carefully constructed lie.

"Why are you doing this?" I screamed, the words a tiny, insignificant plea in the cosmic void.

"You subverted the natural order," the voice rumbled back, its tone a little softer now, as if explaining something simple to a simple child. "You used the perfect machine of human intellect to kill a man's future, and I am the universe. I am the balance. I tried to reach you. I tried to make you understand. The ones you saw... they were lost souls. They were already at the end of their rope. I took them. I put them somewhere better. And I used their bodies to show you the error of your ways. I tried to correct the imbalance you created."

I dropped to my knees, the weight of a thousand star systems pressing down on me. I tried to argue, my voice a broken whisper, "But you caused death... Brenda... Franco..."

"Their bodies were already gone," the Universe replied, a gentle, sad certainty in its voice. "They were just shells, vehicles of my will. They were suffering, and I ended that suffering. I showed you the consequences of your actions through their lives and deaths. You destroyed a man with a mind so broken, so filled with guilt and sorrow, that he lost himself completely. And you did it for nothing." The Universe paused, the light from its body dimming a little, as if in mourning. 

The being released me, sending me tumbling to the floor that used to exist, the sensation of falling a strange comfort in the impossible reality I now inhabited. The being's form wavered, the stars and galaxies that made up its body beginning to twist and churn, a final, beautiful storm. Then, a single, perfect finger of pure starlight extended from its hand, and it pointed directly at me. I didn't feel pain. I didn't feel anything. I simply dissolved, my body, my mind, my memories, everything I had ever been, erased. I was gone, a debt collected, a wrong made right.
