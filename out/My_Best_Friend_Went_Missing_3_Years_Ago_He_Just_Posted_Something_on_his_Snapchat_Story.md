It felt unreal, seeing that purple ring around his profile. I had dedicated my entire life and soul to searching for him, and there it was, activity on his thought to be dead Snapchat account.

Cody had been my best friend since the second grade. We had gotten along like two peas in a pod since the day we met. When he disappeared when we were both 19, it felt like part of me had been taken with him. After six months of searching, the police declared it a cold case, but I never gave up. I had spent the better part of two years looking for Cody. But to no avail. I became depressed, without my best friend there was no point to living. I hadn't trusted people enough to tell anybody, but I was close to just ending it all, when I just happened to open Snapchat, hoping somebody had reached out to me.

And there it was. It felt too good to be true. How can somebody just disappear into thin air, and then suddenly post again? Holding my breath, I opened it.

It wasn't much, but then again I didn't know what I was expecting. It's not like I thought I'd open it and all of the sudden Cody would be there, smiling at a party, saying "I'm back!" or something.

It was just a black screen, with the simple words,

**hello daniel.**

Daniel was my name. He specifically mentioned me. Did he know I was looking for him? Do I respond? If I did, what would I even say? I thought long and hard about what to type, deleted many paragraphs of writing, but eventually settled on a simple, *'sup?*

I saw his Bitmoji, the animated brown hair and freckles with a blue shirt that had been absent in my life for the past three years pop up onto the screen, and I almost jumped. My hands started shaking as I saw him typing, and I was scared I was sweating so much I would drop my phone.

**It's been a while.**

I thought about how to respond to that. Fuck yeah, it's been some time. Care to explain, Cody?

**yup.**

I cursed myself for being so dry, but I knew that if I did anything else, I'd end up sending him an entire essay.

**I'm sorry that i left you. i can't explain anything, but I'm here now.** 

After that we just talked, shooting the shit. It was like he never left. He was the same Cody from all those years back. For a few hours, the darkness of the world faded away. Cody was here, and that was all I cared about. 

He didn't ever tell me what happened, and he never showed his face. A little part of me thought it was a scam, maybe somebody had just stolen his phone somehow and was catfishing me. But I could tell it was Cody. I had talked to him every day since we were eight, I could pick up his mannerisms. And without a doubt, this was Cody. 

After a while, I decided to tell him about the past three years. Everything. The years I spent searching for him, the missing posters that used a photo of him that I knew he hated, every last detail. I even trusted him enough that I told him about how I was depressed. 

**i know.** He responded, which confused me. When I asked him if he could send me his location so I could see him again, he said,

**i'm not allowed to let you join me. it's not time.**

The more I talked to him, though, the more things felt... off. I mean, it was surely Cody, don't get me wrong. But something wasn't right. Every time he texted me it felt like he was withholding something, like he knew something I didn't. The weirdest part was a conversation we had a week or two after we reunited. I told him that I wish I could see him, and not just text him. It was nice to be able to talk to him and all, but I missed the comfort of his presence. 

**i'm right here.** 

He said. 

**dude you're freaking me out** I responded. What the hell did he mean, I'm right here? No the fuck he wasn't. I saw that Cody's Bitmoji was still peeking over the screen, spying on me. He was probably thinking about what to say. After a while I realized neither of us were probably going to say something, so I added, **prove it.**

**look behind you.**

With that, I was frozen in fear. It didn't feel like anyone was watching me. Was Cody really... here? Slowly, my head turned behind me.

Nothing. I don't really know what I expected, it's not like I thought I'd turn around and Cody would have just magically reappeared in my room after three years. But the more I looked, I did actually see something. 

Cody loved to doodle, especially in elementary school. He'd always get in trouble for drawing on his schoolwork. He had this sparkly blue pen that he wrote literally everything with. He drew less as he got older, but something he would do up until the day he was gone was that super S thing. You know the one. I always thought that it was childish, especially because we were 19 at the time, but it was what made Cody, Cody.

And there, drawn on my wall, with that familiar sparkly cyan ink, was a super S. I don't know when it got there, or how, but that solidified it for me, Cody was here. And it freaked me out.

I didn't talk to Cody much after that. It kind of made me feel sick every time I thought of him. I tried to rationalize it. Maybe that really was just a prank, and that super S on my bedroom wall had been there for years, I just didn't notice it until now. But I had been getting better. The world didn't seem grey anymore. I thought back to the time, right before Cody came back into my life, and how close I was to leaving the world. Even if it was a scam, he kind of saved my life. 

Suddenly, my phone rang, and I jumped. 

The sheriff's office? Why was the sheriff calling me? Cautiously, I picked it up. 

"Hello?"

"Daniel Greene?" 

"Yes, this is he."

"Please report to the sheriff's office immediately, we need your assistance in identifying a body." The voice on the other side of the phone said, and I felt my body freeze up. 

Maybe it wasn't who I thought it was. Then again, it could really only be one person. 

I felt like I was in a trance as I walked to the sheriff's. I opened the door, where one of the officers greeted me.

"Come along, Mr. Greene." 

"Who is it?" I asked immediately. 

The officer shifted his weight. "You were the emergency contact for Cody Mccain, right?"

My heart sank. I nodded.

"We just recovered a body from the lake the same age and weight as Mccain. We need you to identify the body." 

He took me into a room, where a rotted body lay on a counter. 

It was bloated, and it was old, but it was Cody. I knew. Best friends can tell.

"How old is the body?" I asked.

"I'm not sure if I can release that info, sir, I-"

"Just tell me how old the fucking body is, damnit!" I snapped.

"W-we, uh, we're estimating it to be about three years old, around the time he went missing, sir!" 

 *about three years old, around the time he went missing.*

So that begged the question;

*If Cody was dead, then who had I been talking to?* 

I felt like vomiting. This couldn't be real. I knew it was Cody, his energy was unmistakable. But he was dead. I thought back to how lost I was before he started texting me. His weird messages. How he wouldn't show me his face.

***i'm not allowed to let you join me. it's not time.***

The way he responded when I wanted to see him.

Was Cody... protecting me? Was it possible he did this all to keep me from killing myself? It was all too much to think about. Just then, my phone went off. It was a sound I was all too familiar with, the bright bing of a Snapchat notification.

***Cody is typing...***
