I recently got out of the hospital from this incident, and I was debating posting this, but I think that I might as well share this story.

So, it started about a month or so ago. I was just about to start backing out of my parking spot at my job but I heard some sort of scratching sound coming from under the car. I stopped the engine and went to look under the car, but I saw nothing. I went to the other side of the car to check and see if it looked different from that side. Still, nothing. So I got back into the car and drove back home.

The next morning, I was wondering what the sound was, but I pushed it away, thinking it was probably a squirrel or something. I thought nothing of it, until around a week later. I heard the scratching sound again, but it was more intense and was faster. There were also sounds of something moving around, bumping against the bottom of the car. I got out of my car, just like the last time this had happened, and looked down under the car. There was, once again, nothing. I still thought it was a squirrel, but it was so weird that a squirrel would go under my car again, just a week later, and in the same spot.

I drove home, and tried to look up whether anyone else had dealt with anything like this before. Nothing, so I looked up how common it was for squirrels to get under cars while they're parked, and there was also nothing. Most likely because they don't get statistics on squirrels under cars. I gave up, and tried thinking of any other explanations, but I couldn't think of anything other than a small animal. I was kinda confused, so I asked one of my friends about it. He joked that it was the Alvin, and I laughed, but I couldn't really get the thought of something else happening out of my head.

The final time it happened, and also the reason why I was in the hospital in the first place, was 2 days ago. I heard the scratching. But it was mixed with whispers that I couldn't understand. The scratching sounded like it was chipping the paint off of the metal, or was digging through it entirely. I was terrified. When I heard it stop, I was deciding whether or not to check what was making that sound, and I was starting to drive away, but something flashed in my head.

It was an image of some creature inside of my bedroom window, with my house aflame. There was blood seeping from the windows, and a tower of smoke obscuring everything else in the picture. I blinked for a second, and I jumped, taking my foot off of the pedal. I was just sitting there, thinking of the image I had just seen, but there were honks littering my hearing. I realized I was blocking traffic, and pulled back into my spot.

I really, truly didn't want to, but I knew, somehow, deep down, that the image would become reality if I didn't check. So I opened the door, and as soon as my leg touched down, I fell over. I felt a slice of pain in the back of my ankle, and there was a puddle of blood around my foot. I was seeing spots, and I soon blacked out.

When I woke up, I was in the hospital. A nurse looked over, and said "Oh! You're awake." I looked around the room, at the bandage on my ankle, with a line of red right where I felt a tingle of pain, a lot less than I thought I would feel. I was trying to reach down to massage my ankle to help the pain, but the nurse stopped me. "You can't touch the bandage, sweetie. It's gotta heal somehow."

I asked how long I was out, and she said "5 hours. You were smilin' in your sleep, though." I was thirsty, so I grabbed the cup of water on the table next to my bed. There were a couple of pills sitting next to it, but the nurse took them saying they must've fallen out of a bottle or something. 2 hours after this, and I was at my house, paying an Uber driver. I unlocked the door, and I immediately lied on the couch to rest. The rest doesn't matter, it's just recovery.

The weird part, though, is that I saw the hand holding the knife that sliced my ankle. And it was such a pale white, it couldn't have been human. I was bony. It looked like the hand of the creature who was in the image I saw when I tried to back out of the spot.

There's no ending to this story. I don't know why it happened, who the creature is, anything about anything. So, I guess I'm trying to see if I'm crazy or not.
