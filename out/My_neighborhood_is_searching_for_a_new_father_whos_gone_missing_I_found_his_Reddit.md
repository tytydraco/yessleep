I recently joined a missing person search in my area. I don’t personally know the man who disappeared, but we live in the same neighborhood and I have mutual friends with him, so I figured it was the right thing to do to join the effort. 

His wife had already called all their friends, family, and called hospitals and the police, but couldn’t find any trace of him. We all got together and trawled the neighborhood, checked the ditches and all that in case he’d had a car wreck—even though his car was still at home, but you can never be too careful, I guess. Well anyway, to make a long story short, we still haven’t found him, and it’s been a couple of weeks now, and of course his wife is distraught. 

A lot of people are starting to gossip that he’s just a deadbeat who decided he didn’t want to be a father and husband, and yadda yadda. At first I was kinda thinking the same, but then I started digging a bit into his social media. And lo and behold, his instagram and twitter handles are the same as his reddit username. His post history suggests he’s not a deadbeat at all. Maybe he’s gone a little bonkers. Maybe he’ll show up in the news after kidnapping some poor family’s baby. 

But I’m sharing this here in case any of you people can find any potential clues to where he is, especially if he needs some professional help. Copy + pasted several of his posts below.

We brought home the wrong baby. 

I’m sure of it. And it’s not like it’s something that’s never happened before. There are news stories about this pretty much all the time, and TV shows too. This isn’t our baby. Someone else has our baby. Switched at birth, hospital incompetence, whatever you want to call it. The baby we have in our house, that my partner is holding right now, is just not our baby, even if all the records say otherwise. 

I keep trying to tell her, but she doesn’t want to talk about it. Doesn’t even want to entertain the idea. I get it, I do. She’s already attached to this baby, been feeding it and changing it and all that stuff. It’s impossible not to bond with the baby. I really get that. 

And I want to underscore that I don’t hate this baby, okay? It’s just not *our* baby. It’s not the baby we made together. It’s not *our* baby. I don’t want to get rid of this wrong baby, I just want to fix this situation. I’m sure the other parents who are the actual parents of this baby would want it, right? We’re all on the same side. We just want things to be the way they’re supposed to be. 

I can’t just take this one back to the hospital or to the police station demanding an exchange. My partner and I need to put our heads together and try to figure out next steps. 

So how do I convince my partner that this isn’t our baby? 

EDIT: Thanks for the comments and advice, everyone. I got a lot of questions about how I knew this isn’t our baby, so I guess I should explain that a little more. 

First of all, the baby doesn’t look like us. I don’t mean in the sense that it has dad’s eyes or mom’s nose or whatever. I mean, if you compare this baby to any of the baby photos in our families, it doesn’t resemble any of us. You know how some babies look like an uncle or a grandmother when they were babies? This one doesn’t. My partner and I dug out the family albums and everything, we wanted to do a little cute Facebook post and tag the family member the baby looked most like. That’s when we realized the baby doesn’t have any family features. My partner was disappointed but she insists that it’s just how our particular genes mixed together, a fluke. But I disagree, especially with everything else I’ve noticed. 

The baby won’t breastfeed. We have to bottle feed. It’s like the baby doesn’t like the taste of my partner’s milk, because it’s not the right milk. Babies can sense stuff like that. 

The baby is also quiet. It almost never cries. It never smiles or laughs. It’s like it’s waiting for something, or trying to tell us something. Like it’s trying not to bond with us because we’re not the natural parents. 

I’ll ask her to consent to another DNA test. Or I can just send samples without bothering her, just to make sure and not cause any needless distress. Maybe the first results were an error. 

Edit 2: Okay, I get it. Some babies just don’t latch well or just have a gentle temperament. I wasn’t trying to say the baby is evil or anything, I’m just saying that it’s not the way our baby would behave, based on our family history. Every time our parents come over, they make comments about how *different* this baby is compared to us when we were babies. That’s all I’m saying. 

Anyway, I’ve called the hospital again, and went there and demanded the nursery security footage. Usually they only keep footage for 90 days, but there’s a nurse who believes me, and she secretly recorded it on her phone and shared it with me. This is big. She told me that it happens sometimes, babies get mixed up. The footage she recorded doesn’t show them mixing up any babies, but it could have happened at any point, even outside the room. The hospital is denying everything, of course. 

I’ve reached out to parent boards and forums, asking if this has happened to anyone else and how they realized it had happened. It’s usually based on looks—a baby with brown eyes when both parents have blue eyes, or just that the baby doesn’t look like either of them. Stuff like that. And they get DNA testing done, just like we did. And it turns out the babies were switched! Just like ours. 

So the DNA test must have returned erroneous results for the baby we brought home, because I know for sure that this isn’t our baby and none of you is going to convince me otherwise. You’re not here. You can’t see what’s going on. 

I’m sending another sample for DNA testing.

Disagreement over raising baby 

My partner and I are having a huge disagreement right now about whether we should raise this baby. For context, there was a mix-up and we brought the wrong baby home from the hospital. (It’s a whole thing.) 

I don’t want to keep this baby. I’m not saying we should kick it to the curb or yeet it into the nearest dumpster. I’m saying we shouldn’t be bonding with this baby. We need to be looking for its real parents so we can switch them back. Then we can bond with our real baby. 

But my partner actually believes that this baby is ours, even though it obviously isn’t. She thinks hospitals have protocols to prevent mix-ups, but she doesn’t understand that no system is infallible. But that’s a different issue. 

The issue is that she doesn’t even want to try to figure out where our real baby is. She wants to go through life raising this baby instead of our own. I keep asking her what if our real baby is in an abusive household or something? Shouldn’t we be trying to save our own flesh and blood? It makes me sick just thinking about what our baby could be going through…

Am I wrong here? We literally have the wrong baby, but nothing I say will convince her that we should find our real baby. What am I supposed to do??? 

EDIT: Some of you need to learn how to put yourself in another person’s shoes. How would you feel if your baby was just switched and you had no idea where they were or who was taking care of them? Your baby could be dead for all you knew. How would you feel? 

Like I said I don’t hate the baby we have right now. It didn’t do anything wrong. But I want the baby who was supposed to come home with us. Not this one.

Paternity test results keep coming back with false positives?

To make a long story short, my partner gave birth a few months ago, and there was a mix-up at the hospital. We ended up bringing home the wrong baby, and I got suspicious enough to get a paternity test. 

My partner agreed to the first one, but when it came back positive it satisfied her the baby we have now is biologically ours. I kept trying to tell her it was obviously a mistake and I wanted to do another test, so I sent in another sample. 

It just came back positive again. Is it common for DNA tests to give false positives? Or is it possible that this baby is a distant cousin to me or something and that’s why it keeps showing a relation between us? Because this definitely isn’t my baby.

I feel like I’m losing my mind

My partner and I brought the wrong baby home from the hospital and no one believes me. No one is listening to me. I keep pointing out things like how the baby looks and acts nothing like us, I show her the news stories about people who find out later in life that they were switched at birth, and I found some evidence that paternity tests might not even be reliable. 

I just want to find my baby and make sure everything is way the it’s supposed to be. Is that so bad? 

All these months I’ve never said anything bad about the baby we’re taking care of right now. It’s just different. It’s just not ours. 

It still almost never cries, but it never smiles or laughs, either. It drinks a lot of formula (because it refused to breastfeed) but it hasn’t grown much bigger. The babies in our families have always been big and grown fast. On both our sides, babies are usually sitting up around six months. But it’s been seven months and this baby can’t even support its own head yet. My partner has gone to the doctor and they ran some tests that all came back normal. Maybe it’s normal for the family the baby is actually from, probably. But it’s just another piece of evidence for me that this isn’t our baby. 

What am I supposed to do? This isn’t a movie where I can just hire a hacker to get into the hospital mainframe and find the names of every person who was born that day or gave birth that day. I tried to find birth announcements in the papers from earlier this year and even checked on Facebook. In a few months the babies will be turning one, so I could look for “baby’s first birthday” posts on social media, but the longer I wait the more anxious I get not knowing what happened to our baby. How am I supposed to find our real baby???

Looking for sources on changelings 

Someone mentioned a creature called a changeling to me, and I was wondering if anyone has any in-depth resources on what they are, how they’re recognized, how they’re dealt with, etc.? I know that they vary by culture so I guess I’ll take whatever you got. TIA

Baby may not be human

My partner and I brought home the wrong baby after a mix-up, and the hospital
has always denied the mix-up and all four DNA tests I took came back positive, which is impossible because I know for a fact that this isn’t our baby. I came across resources about changelings, which are non-human creatures (usually fairies or trolls) that switch their babies with humans so that humans are raising the non-human baby, which is disguised to look like a human baby. 

I found some tests to determine whether a baby is a changeling. I used an eggshell as a bowl and started cooking with it, and the baby started laughing. I almost fainted. This baby almost never laughs, ever. It barely even smiles. But it laughed at the egg test. 

But I kept testing it, just to be sure. 

One of the signs of a changeling is that they don’t grow right—and this baby definitely doesn’t. At seven months old it still couldn’t even lift its own head. After my partner took it to the doctor it finally smartened up and started sitting up a little, just enough to make my partner happy that it was meeting some milestones or whatever. 

In some sources changelings do strange things when they think no one is looking. I set up a nanny cam to watch it. And what did I see? When it’s alone, the baby will crawl around and pull itself up into a standing position. If it senses someone approaching, it drops back down and pretends it’s helpless so someone will pick it up. A real baby doesn’t act like that. 

I think it knows that I know. 

——

Those are all the posts he made on Reddit, unless he had a throwaway account I can’t find. I did look a little to see if anyone was posting weird stuff like “how to kill a changeling,” but I haven’t come across anything, so I guess that’s good. 

I also can’t figure out where he got the idea of a changeling. I haven’t seen any comments on his posts suggesting his baby was a changeling. Maybe he heard it from a TV show, or he came across the term on his own as he tried to justify his belief. 

EDIT: Thanks to u/ XXXX for looking into this and actually managing to find what might be his throwaway account. Copy + pasted below:

cant take it anymore

theres something wrong with this baby and i cant be around here anymore. my partner doesnt get it, she isn’t listening to anything im saying, were always fighting now about this because i cant let it go. but how can i let it go? this isn’t my baby. it isn’t hers eiether. it’s just not and i don’t understand why she won’t listen. 

it’s not even about a mix-up anymore. there was no mix-up, it was an intentional switch. someone wanted us to raise their baby so they took ours and left their own. it’s a changeling. 

it’s not that farfetched if you look at nature. the cuckkoo birds lay their eggs in another bird’s nest so they don’t have to raise the chicks themselves. they even throw out eggs that are already there to make room for their own. they don’t switch. they just get rid of eggs so they can replace them. 

i can only pray that this isn’t what happened with my baby. i would rather die than find out our baby was killed and replaced with the changeling 

i have to find my baby, i just don’t know were to start. but i can’t keep staying here and fighting over it, it doesn’t get us anyway anywhere. 

but more importantly i can’t stay here becase the changeling knows that i know. i can tell by the way it looks at me. theres just something off about it, like its telling me something, threatening me. like it knows what happened to its kind throughout history and is warning me what will happen if i even try it

in legends you can whip a changeling or stick it in a fire to make its parents come back and trade your real child back. but who would believe me today? if i even suggested doing something like that, or if i got caught trying it while my partner was running errands, i would be thrown in prison and we would have no chance of ever getting our baby back

but i have to at least try. i’m taking the changeling and going as far away as possible. i’ll find some place in the woods and hang it and start beating it. i’ll drown it somewhere. someplace out of the way where no one will interrupt

im shaking so much as i write this, im sitting in the car but i know i can’t take the car because it’ll tip people off. the changeling already knows something is up, i don’t know what itll do, what it can do. i don’t know what it really is

i dont want to do this but theres no other way, someone has to or our baby will never come home. this is the only chance anyone will get 

when my partner is asleep i’ll take the changeling and run, as fast and far as i can. ill do whatever i have to do to make the changeling confess, or call its mother, or whatever happens. ill make its mother return my real baby. 

even if it doesn’t work it’s better for everyone that i get rid of the changeling. i would rather die than keep living in this horror, and id rather die than come home empty-handed 

whatever happens, i did what i had to. i just wanted anyone to know

It’s not a hundred percent certain whether this is actually his throwaway account, but it seems likely given the rest of his post history and his wife saying he was increasingly agitated and paranoid in the last few days before he disappeared. Here’s part of one of her Facebook posts from a few weeks ago: 

XXX IS STILL MISSING!!!!! Please don’t let the search lose momentum!!!

People have been asking about how XXX was behaving before he disappeared because that might give some clues to where he might have gone. He’s just been struggling lately, we had made an appointment for him to see a psychiatrist and I think that may be why he disappeared so suddenly, maybe he was afraid he would be institutionalized—I really don’t know, and I don’t care, I just want him to come home safe. We were talking about seeing a psych for a couple of weeks because I think the pressure of being a father was getting to be too much for him, he had a lot of anxiety about our baby being switched at the hospital because BB doesn’t look very much like either of us, but that’s just genetics. (Yes, the paternity tests say he is the father!!) He’s been acting odd lately, like playing with eggshells to “make BB laugh.” But then when BB laughed it only seemed to mess XXX up even more…He hasn’t been sleeping, he just stays up all night to watch BB on the baby monitor. During the day he’s always reading something on his phone and won’t tell me what it is, and he deletes his browsing history. He’s been very high strung and paranoid about the baby and about everyone else, always looking around like he’s being watched…He seemed scared of something but he wouldn’t talk to me, that’s why I tried so hard to get him to agree to see a psych. 

I know that some people are going to call XXX crazy or make wild accusations like he’s cheating on me or thinks that I cheated on him, but he just needs help. There’s something happening to him and he needs to go to the hospital. I have no idea where he would have gone! He just disappeared in the middle of the night and didn’t take anything with him, no notes, nothing! Please keep looking for him!! I just want him to be safe and get the help he needs. 

—

In any case, he never took the baby like the throwaway suggested, just left on his own. And for what it’s worth, he never hurt the baby (at least, according to his wife). I’ve seen the baby a few times myself over these last few weeks, and he looks happy and healthy to me, even if a little on the small side. He laughs a lot too, despite the circumstances. 

If anyone has any ideas on where to find this missing person, please call the police at (XXX)XXX-XXXX. Thank you!
