Knock. Knock. Knock.

I awoke before the sound came, as I always did. The noise was never loud—only sure. Three soft raps, spaced just so, like a memory knocking on bone. The hush that followed was heavy, not around me but inside me. My heart beat fast in the dark, as if warning me of something I hadn’t remembered yet. Something had followed me out of sleep—not just the knock, but a shadow. A nightmare. Or the echo of one.

I could still feel it clinging behind my ribs, wet and cold like a newly thawed spring. There’d been crying. Or maybe screaming. The details slipped through my fingers like cornmeal—the more I reached, the faster they scattered. But I was certain of one thing: the nightmare and the knocking had surfaced together. They shared something. A rhythm. A root.

I lay still, waiting for my heart to slow, and breathed through the silence. The room smelled of extinguished fire and cedar from the wedding chest at the bed’s foot—carved by hands that never came home. I sat up slowly, one palm to the mattress, one to my knee until it popped. My fingers ached with morning, though it was just past midnight.

The quilt pooled at my waist, seams worn thin by decades of tugging it close—of holding warmth in a house that had forgotten what warmth meant. Down the hallway, the parlor clock ticked through dust. Its walnut case dulled to dried tobacco, edges nicked by generations of touch. Cobwebs veiled its corners like lace. The pendulum swung behind clouded glass, slow and hesitant. Age carved into wood and woman, but still, they ticked on.

I didn’t bother with the lamp—an old relic with a blackened chimney and brass base, lost to time. I moved through the house like I belonged—not as mistress or guest, but as memory. In the parlor, the photograph still stood—untouched. A barefoot girl in muslin leaned into a boy in Confederate grey, his smile nervous, his cavalry hat askew, as if rebellion followed him from battlefield to altar.

We’d posed nearly half a minute, stiff and still, hands grazing their sides. I had been breathless—not from nerves, but awe. A photograph—a miracle. When the shutter clicked, I’d believed they’d captured eternity. Now it was no miracle, only a testimony to loss. A frame of grief dressed as memory.

I paused. Listened. Then moved to the window. The lace curtain, yellowed and thumbtacked where the rod had long since failed, stirred faintly. I lifted a corner. Frost had come— I felt it in my joints and saw it threading the pane like tiny roots. The yard stretched wide beneath the moon. Five elms stood crooked along the fence, cloaked in moss. They’d been planted before sorrow replaced the love in these walls.

Beneath the tallest elm—the one planted last—something shifted.

A shadow. Small. Still. Watching.

The knocking hadn’t come again. It never did. Just once—three measured taps at 12:37—and then silence. The kind that presses on your chest and dares you to breathe.

“Maybe it’s the wind,” I said, though my voice didn’t sound like my own.
“Or ghosts?”

I lingered at the window. Far past the elms, beyond the orchard and brittle fence line, I could smell it—a storm. Not yet arrived, but coming, thick on the air like bruised peaches and burnt iron. The kind that made floorboards groan to break free. I felt it in my pulse, but the wind whispered not yet; the house waited with me. 

Seven nights. Seven knocks. The idea of closing my eyes again without knowing what called from within the elm was inconceivable. I turned from the window, and the hallway was ringing with silence, like a bell toward some unholy hour.

I found the axe where it had always been—leaned crooked behind the cellar door. The handle was splintered, the blade rust-flecked, but it would do. It had to.

I stepped into the yard barefoot. Wind clawed at my nightgown, cold biting my bare soles. The night opened before me like a letter I’d once read and buried—and now had no choice but to read again.

The axe ached in my grip—not from weight alone, but from muscles long atrophied. My shoulders winced with each gust. Cold gnawed through my joints; my lungs burned with night air, but I held on. As one does a duty. The elm loomed ahead, the only thing making a sound in the vast yard. A slow groan from within—like wind trapped in wood. It had been there for seven nights. Calling. Beckoning. Pleading for my undivided attention.

I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, and pushed forward — pain temporarily and hastily tucked behind memory.

Three mornings ago — on the fourth knock — I’d forced herself into town.

It had taken everything I had. I reached the chapel just as the last of the congregation filed out into Sunday light. There he was—the pastor, standing stoically in the doorway. Middle-aged. Soft-spoken. Startled. Not with recognition, but the pause a man gives a ghost.

“Ma’am… You’re from the Peach Plantation, ain’t you?”

“I’m Willa,” I said, voice low, hands trembling. “I need help. There’s something in the elm. Something knocking. I see shadows in the orchard. I feel them in the floorboards. I—” my voice cracked then steeled with resolve, “I need the house blessed.”

“Miss Willa,” he said at last, gentle but careful, “ain’t nobody lived there but you since the war. Folks say even the workers stayed out the house.”

“The land’s mine,” I whispered. “But not what stirs inside it.”

He nodded slowly, unreadable. His eyes lingered — uncertain, unsettled. They reminded me of someone. Not the preacher he was, but the boy he might’ve been?  Had I known him, back then? 

A boy playing in the orchard before brother killed brother in the name of country?

“Maybe it’s the wind,” he said finally, voice steady and soft.

He hadn’t offered prayer—only a slow, pitying glance.

“Of course,” I replied, barely more than breath. “The wind.”

He opened his mouth—maybe to call after me, maybe not—but I’d already turned away.

“You were right,” I murmured, not looking back. “My senses have dulled with age.”

I wasn’t sure he heard.
Wasn’t sure it mattered.
I knew it wasn’t the wind.

That was three days ago. Three more knocks since.

I opened my eyes as I reached the elm. “It wasn’t the wind,” I muttered, teeth clenched. “And I aim to know what it is.”

The elm rose before me like a gallows. Its limbs twisted heavenward, draped in Spanish moss that fluttered without wind. The air was thick, the sky bruised and waiting. Each gust carried warning. I paused at the base, hand trembling—not from fear, but something quieter. Solemn sadness.

“I gotta know,” I whispered.

I lifted the axe. The first swing struck crooked, skimming the bark. The blade bounced back, jarring my elbow with a crackle of old bone. My breath caught, fingers slipped—but I grit my teeth and steeled myself for the next blow. 

The second swing landed better. The third, better still. A deep gash yawned in the bark, weeping syrup-dark sap. In the flash of lightning, it gleamed—not just sap, but tears. My own, withheld with every swing, now falling through the tree instead.

On the fourth swing, the handle gave way with a splintering snap, and the broken shaft gashed the thin, translucent skin of my palm. I let out a strangled cry—more shock than sound—and crumpled beneath the elm. My knees buckled in the frozen mud. My body folded like damp parchment, soaked and too brittle for another blow. The axe fell. I no longer knew if my tears were from pain or defeat—only that I couldn’t hold them back, not after seeing myself bleed echoing the fate of the damned tree.

The tree was bleeding.
I was bleeding.

The tree was weeping.
I was weeping.

I am dying.
Was the tree dying too?

I feel it now—the truth settling in my ribs like wet cotton. Death is close. I hear it pacing behind the storm, waiting for me to surrender. But I won’t. Not yet. Not before uncovering the truth beneath this cursed, groaning tree. Not before learning what haunts me. Or who haunts me?

I reach for the broken haft, hands slick with mud and blood, and begin to dig. If I can’t fell it, I’ll unearth it. I will not be turned away. Thunder cracks above, sharp as judgment as I claw through roots and decay—and then, I see it. Even in darkness, I see it. Confederate Grey.

A scrap of fabric, water-stained, tangled around something round. Familiar. My chest constricts. The storm roars louder, and the years dissolve.

The wind howls as it had that night—the same frantic moaning through the shutters, the same thunder rattling the house to its bones. I’d been alone then, too. Heavy with grief. The silence around me so thick she had nearly drowned. 

My husband had died in Virginia. The letter was full of apologies, folded too many times, stained by someone else’s fingers. I buried it in my wedding chest—and my heart alongside it. 

The wounded soldier came in the misty fortnight that followed, limping and ghost-eyed. I nursed him in the parlor where my wedding photo still stood. A sentinel overseeing my every sinful move. 

His gaze never lingered and he never touched me—until that last night. Rain was thick on the windows. No words. No protest. Just what we both desperately needed: comfort, compassion, companionship in a long night of sorrow and loneliness.

He had left before the ground dried, but his presence had already taken root.  

I hadn’t known. Not really. The signs meant little to a girl raised on silence and obedience. No midwife. No mother. No whisper of what to expect when life began to sprout inside me. I only understood when the pain dropped me to the parlor floor—when the storm outside matched the one inside, and he had come into the world with thunder as his first lullaby.

He was beautiful. Startling blue eyes. Strong lungs. A cry like a trumpet that could’ve woken the whole plantation. I tried to feed him. Tried to hush him. But the storm grew, and his screams grew louder and louder—until the house itself felt like it would burst.

I was afraid.

I was ashamed.

I wrapped him in the only thing nearby—the Confederate Grey blanket from the soldier’s forgotten trunk. The same one I now held in my trembling fingers. I had pressed him to my chest, crying and whispering apologies into his damp, dark hair as I silenced his cries beneath the fabric. He had looked up at me, his small eyes wide— not in fear. Not in anger. In confusion. In concern.

Just like the pastor.

The fabric slips free, sodden and delicate as old parchment. Confederate Grey, dulled by soil and sorrow. Threads unraveling like veins in my hands. Beneath it sits something small. Round. Porcelain-white under a slick of mud. I blink, but the storm lights the saturated ground again.

Bones. 

A piece of skull, no larger than my palm. Nearby, smaller fragments—a curve of rib, the faintest suggestion of fingers. I don’t scream. Don’t cry. I bow. Not in reverence, but in collapse. My forehead presses into the soil, the storm soaking me through. My breath coming in heaves, but the air feels clearer, as if truth has punctured the weight I’ve unknowingly carried in chest all these years. 

“I remember,” I whisper. “God help me, I remember.”

The wind howls louder, and through it I hear him. Not the infant he was, but the boy he might’ve been- laughter in the orchard, unsteady footsteps in the hall, a man’s voice in the dark, “Mama?” I reach out with mud-caked fingers and gather what I can to cradle against my chest. The pieces are cold and crumbling, but to me they feel reverent and precious. Because they are. Because they always had been. 

I know the knocking will never come again—not after the earth gave up its truth and revealed my darkest secret.

Now, only silence and thunder will echo through the elms.
