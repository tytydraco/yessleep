‘’I had been working as a radio host on an almost forgotten station called Channel 106

for a few weeks. I first got the job because the previous radio host had gone missing.

It was a station based in a small town named Iron Lake so it was the kind of station that

only a handful of people listened to. I would mostly air music that was popular within the

town, interrupted by small segments where I would take music requests from callers or

have guest speakers over at the station. I did these segments around once every few

hours. I also had a boss who would pop in every few days. He was also my

landlord, which is how I had first heard about the job opening at the station.



A few days ago, I started experiencing some odd events involving the station. It started

out as a day like any other, nothing out of the usual.  As I was receiving some music

 requests, a caller put in a request for a song called Coffee at Nellie’s.

The callers voice was monotone, almost robotic. I didn’t pay much attention to it.

However, once I looked up Coffee at Nellie’s to play it I wasn’t able to find anything at all.

I shrugged it off as someone misremembering the song’s name and went about my day.



Things got weird once I got home. I stayed at a small duplex, I lived on the side of the

house with the blue door, while the unit next to mine had a green door. My boss owned

both units. That night as I was trying to get to sleep, I started hearing radio static

from next door. The sort of sound you would hear in between two radio stations.

Among the radio hissing, I could make out the lyrics to a song. The lyrics were about a

couple drinking coffee at a diner: Nellie’s Diner. The song was Coffee at Nellie’s.

I just thought that the next-door tenants were listening to music on the radio, and boiled

it down to a coincidence. The next day, I went to the station as usual.



At noon, I received a call from a man who wanted to come to the station and talk about

his new fishing gear shop on air. He arrived an hour later. He was an old, heavyset man

with a long beard. During our segment he talked about his new business, things like the

location, types of fishing gear, and discounts.

He eventually started talking about how passionate he was about fishing, talking about

fishing as if it was the greatest thing to grace the planet. He went on and on about how

he felt like he was making music while listening to the sounds of his fishing rod when

reeling fish in. I remember jokingly thinking to myself: ‘’He talks about fishing like

he’s writing a love song’’. I don’t think he’d have been too happy if I had said it out loud.

After the segment, he thanked me for my time and I went on with my daily broadcast

routine. 

That night, as I was trying to sleep at home, I once again started to hear radio

static from next door. Among the static, I could hear a voice. It was my own voice.

It was a loop of my voice saying the same phrase over and over: ‘’ He talks about fishing

like he’s writing a love song.’’. Unlike the song that had played the night before, this

couldn’t have been a coincidence. How did it know what I had thought of in

my mind? Was it just my head messing with me? Shaking with every step, I made my way

over to the next-door unit’s green door. I knocked on the door profusely, I started

shouting and asking who was inside. But there wasn’t a single sound, and the radio

noises were gone. I tried opening the door but it was locked shut. Afterwards, I noticed a

‘For Rent’ sign in front of the house. If the unit was empty, then what was making all

those noises? 



The next morning I texted my boss while on my way to work and told him

about the sounds I had heard coming from next-door. He told me he’d check the unit

during the day and let me know if anybody was there. Once I was at the station nothing

of note happened, no music requests, no guest speakers, just a fairly uneventful day.

After work, as I was heading home, I noticed that the green door of the next-door unit

was open. I thought my boss was checking to see if anyone was inside so I headed

in to talk to him. Once I entered the unit, my boss was nowhere to be seen. It was

completely empty except for a couch and a small cabinet. I decided to check the

bedroom, only to find a figure lying on the floor. I found a light switch and turned it on.

The figure on the floor was a dead body. It was the body of a man around his twenties. 



I was scared, I didn’t understand what was going on. There was a name tag on the man’s

shirt and it was for Channel 106. He was the previous radio host who had gone missing

weeks ago. He hadn’t died a violent death. He looked very skinny, like he had died from

starvation. I ran back to the front door, only to find it locked. Someone had locked it from

behind me. Could it have been my boss? Was he the one behind all of this? I tried calling

the police, but my phone ran out of battery. I tried breaking the door, but it was no use.

I felt absolutely hopeless. 



I looked around the unit and noticed a radio on top of the cabinet. 

It was the radio I had been hearing all of the noises from. I stayed up all night

next to the radio. I turned the dial to Channel 106 but it was completely silent as we were

off-hours. At around 8AM, the broadcast started. The voice of the host was of a man I’d

never heard before. He played music and took some song requests. He stated that this

was his first day working for the station, and that he was excited. He continued the usual

program schedule. 



Three days passed after I first got stuck in the house, and I was getting 

weak. I hadn’t had any food or water and I was nearing my death.

I was at a point where I could hardly speak or even stand up.

The body was starting to smell even worse. This morning, before the broadcast

had started, I heard some noises coming from my unit next door. It was the voice of my

boss and the new radio host, I couldn’t understand all of what they talked about but I

could make out the new host thanking my boss for letting him move into the unit. I tried

to make my voice heard, but at that point, I was too weak to yell. 



After the broadcast began, as the new host was taking music requests, he got a request for 

a familiar song: Coffee at Nellie’s. A bit later, he apologized for not being able to find the 

song and continued playing other music. 

The program went on until 11PM, and I was left with static.

I heard some noises coming from my unit, it was probably of the new host moving

in. Long after the broadcast had ended, at around 2AM, the radio started emitting the

loud hissing noise, it got louder until a song started playing: Coffee at Nellie’s.

Half an hour has passed since the song had started playing on the radio, I’m writing these

last sentences of my letter while listening to Coffee at Nellie’s inside the locked unit. I

don’t believe I have the energy to make it through tonight. If anybody finds this letter,

make sure that nobody else steps near the green door.‘’



This letter was recovered at the scene. Five bodies were found inside the unit with the

green door, all of whom had presumably died of isolation.
