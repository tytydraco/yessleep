As a detective, it’s hard to find a case worse than Ruby’s.

The cops showed up at her house around 8 PM. They’d been called by the next-door neighbor, an old woman standing by the front yard waiting for the patrol car. She looked scared, her face stiff, pointing with a shaky hand at Ruby’s front door.

When the officers kicked the door open, they were hit by a rotten stench no one could quite describe or trace. One of them later told me that the lights and electronics in the house kept flickering on and off for no reason.

They found Ruby in the living room, sitting on the floor, legs crossed. In her left hand, she was clutching an ice pick stained red. And on her lap, the bloody body of a child, with a deep wound in the chest. That was Bruno, her twelve-year-old son.

Ruby didn’t react when they arrived. Her eyes bulged, mouth half open. She was catatonic, completely gone.

She stayed that way all the way to the station. We booked her without hearing a single word. I asked them to put her in an interview room so I could try to get something out of her.

We sat across from each other for thirty minutes. I asked if she wanted anything: Coke, juice, water. No answer. I asked her to tell me what happened to Bruno. Still nothing. She kept staring at the wall, silent.

I left her there for a while and grabbed some coffee to figure out my next move. Everything pointed to her killing her kid, but the reason? That was still foggy. I had a feeling there was more to it.

Her family was in shock when we called. Everyone said Ruby had always been a devoted single mom. The neighbor who called the cops told us she often watched the kids while Ruby worked, and had never seen anything weird.

Then my partner walked into the break room, steps quick and clumsy. Typical rookie energy.

“I called the coroner. They’ll run the preliminary exam on the body in a few hours, just like you asked,” he said, waiting for me to pat his back or something.

I thanked him and was about to leave when he called me again, uneasy.

“But isn’t this a waste of time? Looks like the woman went mad. Some kind of psychosis or whatever.”

I told him that yeah, it looked that way, but I still wanted the preliminary report. We needed to rule out any other cause of death. It was a small town, and we had to rely heavily on the one coroner we had. 

I went back to the interview room, pretty much ready to have her transferred to holding. Maybe a shrink could shed some light the next day.

But to my surprise, Ruby had changed her posture. She was now leaning forward, shoulders pressed on the table, her nails dug into the metal surface, like she was anxious.

“I had to stop him before it happened,” she said. First words I heard from her all night.

“What happened?” I asked.

“I had to stop him before he became like his brother,” she said, voice shaky and rough. “Before he became like Brady.”

“What does Brady have to do with Bruno’s death?” I pressed, excited to finally get something.

She didn’t answer right away. She just lowered her head, like she was about to cry.

“You have to kill Brady too,” she continued. “Or he’ll come for his brother.”

\*\*\*

Brady was the missing piece. Ruby’s other son, the older one, fifteen years old. The family said he was quiet but troubled. Had been caught in fights at school more than once and teachers had plenty of complaints about his behavior. 

He wasn’t home when the cops arrived. We’d been trying to reach him for hours with no luck.

I asked Ruby again to tell me what she knew. Told her to help us find the boy. She just leaned back in the chair and went back to that blank stare.

I cleared her for transfer to holding. At that point, I was convinced she’d snapped. Part of me just didn’t want to believe a mother could wake up one day and do that to her own son.

I got in my car, feeling the drag of the night, and headed to the coroner’s office. I had arranged to pick up the rookie after he got the preliminary report.

I parked next to a beat-up Honda Accord, the only car there, and called the rookie’s phone. No answer. Had he left without telling me?

I got out and looked up at the windows of the old two-story building where the office was. One of the lights was still on. So someone was there.

I walked up to the gate, ready to go up and see what was taking so long. The lobby was empty, except for a woman standing still in front of the elevator panel, eyes fixed on the numbers.

To my surprise, it was Ruby’s neighbor. The same old woman who had called the cops earlier that night.

“What are you doing here?” I asked, confused.

“He came to get his brother,” she answered, eyes still on the panel. “They need to be together.”

I asked again, even more confused, but she gave me the same answer. Repeating the thing about a brother. Was she talking about Brady?

I left her speaking with herself and headed for the elevator. My hand kept brushing against the Glock on my hip.

\*\*\*

The hallway on the second floor was dark, and something about the air felt wrong. It was winter, freezing outside, but inside it had to be close to 90 degrees. The only light came from a bulb that kept flickering like it couldn’t decide if it was alive or dead.

I moved slowly toward the only room with the lights still on. The door was half open. I went in with my gun raised, following the stench of rot, a smell like sulfur. It was suffocating.

I took a few steps in, hyper-aware, until I stepped on something sticky. I pointed the gun down and saw a sight I hope to forget someday. And I must have seen over a hundred homicide scenes.

I was standing on part of the rookie. Couldn’t even tell which part. His body was twisted, limbs ripped off or crushed, like he’d been hit by a train.

In the corner, I spotted the coroner’s body, torn apart the same way. I froze, trying to figure out what the fuck. Then I heard footsteps behind me, coming from the hall.

Instinct took over. I raised my gun and shouted for whoever it was to freeze.

Standing in the doorway was a skinny kid, long hair, black hoodie. Brady. I recognized him from the photos. He was holding Bruno’s pale, lifeless body.

This is where my story always falls apart. I’ve tried explaining it to other detectives, to the reporters who came after, but it’s hard to put it into words.

When Brady looked me in the eyes, I saw a blackness so deep it felt like it could swallow me whole. Like staring into a midnight ocean during a storm.

It lasted a second, maybe less, but I knew right then that this wasn’t a kid. It was a monster, still wearing the pale skin of a boy.

Something was inside him. And when his eyes locked on mine, I just stood still. My arms dropped. My legs stopped working. I could barely breathe.

Brady walked away toward the elevator, like nothing happened. And I stood there, useless, for what felt like forever.

When I finally snapped out of it, I ran to the window and saw Brady in the parking lot. He was putting Bruno’s body in the backseat of the Honda Accord. Then he got in the car, and the [old woman drove him away](https://www.reddit.com/user/Accomplished_Low7889/).
