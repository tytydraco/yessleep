<—————————




Inside, the cave swallowed sound almost immediately.

Our footsteps echoed back in strange ways—offbeat, like someone following half a beat behind. The air was cooler, denser. Every breath felt like we were breathing through wool.

The walls were tight in some places, but we remembered the route. There were still the old white chalk marks left by youth before and after us—the arrows pointing deeper in. The deeper we went, the more dust clung to our clothes. The cave smelled like wet rock and stale iron. Something earthy. Old.

Following the chalk down deeper into the cave, staying on the most direct path, we eventually reached the chamber we’d once called
Brave Woman’s Grave.

It looked just like when we last saw it. That flat slab of rock in the center, worn smooth by years of nervous hands. T stood next to it, ran his fingers over the edges, then crossed his arms, turning around to look at me.

I stood there for a moment.

Youthful memories came in waves. All the games we played in here. All the races won and lost. Every trip and fall. Broken bones, busted lips, and bruised knees. A pain so sweet, the yearning I felt for it made me look away—past the slab—as to not sink even further into nostalgia.
This wasn’t why I came.

“I thought you wanted to see it again,” T said, still watching me.

“I did,” I answered. “But I didn’t come all this way just to stop here.”

T looked at me. Silent. Then followed my eyes toward the back wall.

There was a crack there—no bigger than a manhole—one we hadn’t noticed as kids. At least, not until the day S disappeared.

I remembered the Coyote running off behind the slab. He seemed to have vanished into thin air back then.

For obvious reasons, I didn’t put much thought into that detail at the time, but now I know exactly where that scraggly little mutt went.

The mouth of a tunnel, hidden behind loose stone on the other side of the slab. A narrow crawlspace, just barely wide enough to slip through.

I took a step forward.

T put a hand on my shoulder. “We don’t need to go further.”

I shrugged him off. “What, scared of the Little People?”

“I’m serious,” he said.

“So am I. If we’re gonna do this, let’s do it. All the way. No stone left unturned, no tunnel left unexplored. That is, unless… you’re too afraid of your ghost stories.”

“You still don’t get it, do y—” he started.

“I’m going,” I said, cutting him off, “so you can either stay here and wait for your Little People who will never come, or you can follow me to the end and see for yourself. But either way, I’m going.”

His eyes narrowed, but he didn’t say anything.

I turned back toward the tunnel.
“Thought so,” I said smugly.

I dropped to my knees and crawled in.

It was tighter than I expected. My flashlight scraped the walls. My bag kept clinging to the jagged edges—almost like it was trying to stay behind, stay where it was safe. Dust choked the air. Somewhere behind me, I heard T sigh and follow after me.

The tunnel didn’t stretch far—maybe fifty feet—but it twisted in unnatural ways. At one point, we had to belly-crawl under a shelf of jagged stone. At another, we found a small pit that dropped five feet and forced us to slide down on our stomachs.

After about fifteen minutes of crawling, twisting, and contorting our bodies in these tunnels, like a game of dirty, musty Twister, we reached it.

A new chamber.

It was smaller than the Grave. Low ceiling. Damp walls. Strange black moss clung to one side like a scab. A pool of still water in the far corner reflected our lights wrong—too bright, too smooth, like the surface wasn’t water at all.

We stood there, breathing hard.

I pulled my bag off and set it down on the floor near the middle of the chamber. I took out the two bottles of water I’d bought earlier, passed one to T, then twisted the cap on mine and took a much-needed sip.

“How long has it been since we entered the cave?” T asked, twisting the cap back onto his bottle. “I don’t have my phone on me.”

“Forty minutes, at least,” I said, pulling my phone out of my pocket. The time read twenty after 8 a.m.

“We left just after sunrise, so it’s been close to an hour,” I said, putting my phone away, lamenting the thought of having to travel back to the entrance.

Maybe this is far enough, I thought to myself. There really is nothing down here… I was right.

“Why don’t you have your phone?” I asked, inquisitively.

T started to reply before stopping abruptly, the words caught in his throat.

We heard it.

A tap.

Then another.

Sharp. Almost metallic. Rhythmic.

T turned toward me.
“What’s making that noise?”

I shrugged, trying to maintain my cool while actively tensing up.

What could be making that noise?
Rockslide on the side of the mountain?
Some animal roaming around in the cave with us?

No, that’s not right.
This sounds too… intentional.

There’s too much consistency in the sound to just be some random event or animal.

The sound came again. This time, accompanied by a faint scraping.

We aimed our flashlights toward the source—a low tunnel branching off the far side of the room. The light only went a few feet in before vanishing into black.

“It’s probably just the rocks settling,” I said, slightly forcing myself to believe my own words.

I mean, what else could it be?

“It could be them,” T said, as if he were reading my thoughts.

I rolled my eyes. “Jesus, T, there’s no—”

But I didn’t finish that sentence.

Because I saw it too.

Movement.

A flicker of something—something small and fast—darting between the shadows. Too fast to catch with the light. I heard slight taps following the shadow. Were those… footsteps? They echoed throughout the entire chamber.

tap tap tap tap—

“Wha—”
My breath caught in my throat.

T stepped in front of me.

“Stop,” he whispered.

“What?”

“Don’t say anything else. Just listen.”

So I did.

Nothing. Then—

Tap tap tap—scrape

It stopped again. We stood there, tense, listening.
There was something that almost sounded like whispering. Then silence again.

T stepped back. He looked shaken. But not scared. Actually rather… reverent.

“You don’t feel it?” he asked.

I swallowed. “It’s just rock. Echoes. A squirrel, maybe. Or a rat.”

“Rats don’t knock.”

We stood still.

I scanned the ceiling. The corners.
Nothing there. Just stone. Dust.

But something felt off.

The silence had a shape to it. A weight.

Then the chamber shook.

Just slightly—a pulse in the stone. A soft growl through the floor.

I stumbled. The still water rippled in the corner.

T grabbed my arm. “Time to go.”

“Hey, cut it out, it’s fine! There’s a reasonable explanation for this. It’s not your Little People.”
I hissed quietly, pulling my arm from his light grasp.

“It doesn’t matter, let’s jus—” T started to say before being cut off.

The ground gave out.

The floor split. A sharp drop. Stone shattered underfoot. I felt myself falling—weightless—like the cave had opened its mouth and swallowed me whole.

Then everything went black.

———————

I woke to pain.

A sharp, dense ache in my leg, throbbing hard enough to drown out the rest of the world. Then the cold — it wrapped around me like wet fabric, soaked into my clothes, my lungs.

And then light.

Dim. Flickering. Coming from a flashlight propped up on a rock nearby.

T was next to me. His face was drawn tight, a smear of dirt on his cheek, one sleeve torn off. He was focused, tying something around my leg — a belt, his shirt, whatever he could grab.

“You’re awake.” he said, looking up, worry seeping deep into his eyes.

“How long—?” I managed to mumble out.

“I’m not sure,” he said. “You hit your head and passed out cold. Leg’s bad. Not a clean break, but close.”

I shifted, regretting it immediately.
Pain shot up from my leg throughout my entire body, made only worse by the intense throbbing in my head.

I immediately went slack, trying my hardest to regain focus.

The cave around us was different. Smaller than the Grave. Close, jagged walls. Moss on the ceiling. It smelled musty and very earthy.
The air was heavy — not just physically, but… wrong. Like it didn’t belong here.

“What about you, T? Everything still in one piece?” I said, trying to keep my voice steady.
It was wavering. Either from the pain or uneasiness, I was unsure. Maybe both.

“I found my way down.” T said, still focused on my leg. “It wasn’t that far of a drop. My feet stopped hurting already.”

“That far of a drop?” I said, taken aback slightly. “What do you mean by that?”

T looked up at me again, and then back down to my leg. He had this sheepish look on his face I hadn’t seen very often before.

“When I saw you fall down here, I panicked.
And before I knew what I was doing, my body was already moving on its own.”

“You jumped in after me — into a hole you had no idea how deep — just to try and save me?” I asked, confounded and a little emotional.

All this time and he’s still getting himself in trouble for me. Just like when we were kids.

“Well, y-yeah!” he started. “I c-couldn’t just do
n-nothing.” he stuttered, keeping his eyes on my leg, now wrapped in pieces of his shirt.

He seemed embarrassed before trying to regain his usual stoic demeanor.

“Not that it did any good. You still fell pretty hard. This leg is looking pretty bad.” Concern started to cover his face. “I’ll let you rest a little bit longer, but we need to get out of here as soon as possible. I tried your phone, but you fell on top of it — still in your pocket. It’s broken, so no calling for help.”

“Would we even get signal down here?” he wondered aloud.

I reached for the bottle of water he left near me and took a long sip, trying my hardest to hold back the wave of emotion from T’s actions.

Plastic and dust. Still tasted better than my tongue.

He sat down across from me, rubbing at a scrape on his forearm. The flashlight buzzed softly, its beam jittering on the rock wall behind him.

We sat there in silence for a bit.

I could hear my heartbeat in my head, throbbing along to what I could only assume was a pretty bad concussion.

“I was thinking,” I said after a while. “You remember that time I broke my arm and hit my head behind the old boarding school?”

He looked up. “You jumped off the cafeteria.”

“Thought I could land in the branches.”

“You missed.”

I smiled. “I remember you carrying me all the way home.”

“You cried the whole time.”

“Yeah, well, I was in pain.”

“You were mad you left your Game Boy on the roof. You were so worried about grandma whooping your butt, you forgot you had a broken arm.”

“You went back and got it for me the next day just so I’d shut up about it.”

We both laughed — the kind of laugh you hold in your chest for years, afraid it’ll hurt too much to let out.

“You stayed with me in the hospital,” I said. “Slept in that hard, plastic chair next to me so I wouldn’t be alone, and grandma could go home and sleep in a real bed.”

“You asked me if they’d cut your arm off.”

“I asked if you’d still be my brother if they did.”

He smiled, but his eyes didn’t. “You were always scared of being left behind.”

A silence settled between us.

T looked toward the far wall, where the stone curved into darkness.

“Something’s off down here,” he said. “I feel it.”

I looked down, not wanting to argue.
“If you say so.”

So much happened so fast, it was hard to tell what happened at all. I started thinking back to the moments just before the floor gave in.

Then I paused.

Because I did seen something.

Heard something too.

My mind tried to remember the sound we heard.

Tap tap tap

Tap tap tap scrape

A movement. Just on the edge of the light.

I told myself it was just the flashlight flickering. Or dust settling. Or adrenaline.
That’s all. It had to be.

But it wasn’t the first time. Even before I passed out, when we were in the second chamber, I thought I saw—

No. It was nothing.

I blinked hard. Forced myself to drink again.

“You alright?” T asked.

I nodded.

He didn’t believe me. I could tell.

He didn’t push.

That was worse.

I looked at him. Really looked at him.

He was tired. Not just physically. Tired all the way through. But still steady. Still here. Like he always had been.

“I saw something,” I almost said.

But I didn’t.

Instead, I looked past him, into the dark — where the shadows still shifted just a little too slowly. Where something could have been watching. Something small. Something waiting.

I didn’t believe it. I couldn’t believe it.

So I stared harder. Willing it to be nothing.

“You remember the scary stories we used to tell each other just before bed?” I asked, trying to keep my mind from wandering away from me.

“The ones we’d try to freak each other out with the most, but S would be listening in from her room and it would end up keeping her up all night?” T responded with a look of nostalgia.

I smiled a little. “Yeah, and we’d have to stay up with her so she wouldn’t wake up grandma.”

We chuckled.

“I don’t think she was ever really scared,” T said. “I think she just wanted the company.”

“She always tried to be just like us.”

For just a moment, the cave felt lighter.

I looked at him. “You know I love you, right?”

He didn’t answer right away. Then he nodded once.

“I know,” he said. “Me too.”

Silence settled again, but softer this time. Not heavy. Just… shared.



I shifted my leg and hissed. Pain like lightning shot through me.

T sat up. “We should get moving.”

“I know.”

He stood, stretching a little. “Let me get you up.”

He braced under my arm, counted to three, and we rose together. My leg buckled almost immediately. I caught myself on the wall, gritting my teeth hard enough to taste copper.

T steadied me. “Okay. One step at a time.”

We tried. I made it five steps before my vision blurred. Ten before I collapsed again.

T moved with me, making sure I didn’t fall, his arm around me, guiding me to the ground.

“I can’t,” I gasped. “I… fuck, I can’t.”

“Yes, you can.”

“No, T.” I looked at him. “I can’t.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.

We both knew what the next step was, but neither of us wanted to say it first.

The air was still. The only sound was water dripping somewhere behind us.

Then T said, softly, “I’m not leaving you.”

“You’re going to have to.”

“No.”

“You don’t have a choice,” I said, sharper than I meant to. “You’re not gonna carry me out of here. That leg’s done. We both know it.”

He clenched his jaw. “I’ll find a way.”

I shook my head. “You won’t. You’ll get stuck with me. We’ll starve. Die of thirst. Something. And we’ll both die down here for no reason.”

His hands curled into fists. “You think I care?”

“You should.” I paused. “I would.”

He looked away. His eyes were wet, and it shook me to see it.
T, who never flinched. Never broke.
Our stoic older brother who kept it together even when Grandma died. Even when S…

“I already lost one of you,” he said. “I’m not—”

“I’m not S,” I said.

He snapped his gaze back to me.

“I’m not,” I repeated. “You didn’t lose me. Not yet. But if you stay down here, you will.”

“You think I don’t know that?” he said. His voice cracked. “You think I haven’t thought about that every day since we were kids? If I hadn’t listened to you back then… if I hadn’t let myself act so childish…”

“It wasn’t your fault.”

“She was behind me,” he whispered. “When we went in, I left her behind me.”

I didn’t know what to say.

“I shouldn’t have been so focused on that stupid  race. I should’ve kept an eye on both of you. It was my job. I knew the stories of the caves and still I—”
His voice cracked even more, and tears started streaming down his cheek.

“We were kids, T.”

He shook his head. “You didn’t believe. I did. I should’ve known better. But I still followed after you.”

He rubbed his face, angry at the tears now.

I grabbed his wrist. “Then don’t make the same mistake again.”

He looked at me.

“You want to do right by her?” I asked. “Then don’t follow me this time. Go. Get help.”

He didn’t answer.

“Please.”

He sat back on his heels. His whole body trembled — with cold, with rage, with grief. Maybe all three.

Then, slowly, he nodded.

“I’m coming back,” he said. “You better fucking be alive.”

“I will be.”

He looked me in the eye. “If it starts getting bad — if your head and leg-”

“It won’t. I’ll be fine, T. I know you’ll be back as fast as you can. I can make it,” I reassured him.

He exhaled. “Yeah. Okay.”

Then he turned, walked to the edge of the chamber, paused one last time, and looked back.

“I’m not S,” I called again. “I’ll be here when you get back.”

He nodded once.

“I love you, too,” he said under his breath before he disappeared into the dark.

⸻

And just like that, I was alone.

It was hard to say exactly how long he’d been gone — it couldn’t have been more than a few minutes.

The last thing I remember clearly was the sound of T’s boots scuffing against stone, followed by the dim echo of his voice disappearing around a bend. I told him not to look back. I don’t know if he heard me.

The second quake, when it came, didn’t feel like much. Just a thud in the earth. A shift. A cough in the bones of the mountain.
A few pebbles fell from somewhere above, bouncing off the slab beside me like warning shots.

I stared at the mouth of the tunnel after it settled, waiting for a flashlight beam to reappear. Hoping it wouldn’t.
Hoping the quake didn’t turn him around to check on me.

I knew what it would mean if he did come back. It would mean he couldn’t leave me.
Couldn’t commit to the one thing I needed him to do.

So I sat still and hoped he didn’t.

I hoped the weight of everything — tradition, guilt, ghosts — wouldn’t pull him backward.
I hoped, for once, that he’d be selfish enough to save me. Or at least save himself.

But nothing happened.

Just stone and stillness.
