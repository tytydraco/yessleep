I’m mystified by how our brains work. I can’t tell you in great detail what happened to me yesterday. According to my wife, I can’t tell you anything in great detail unless it has something to do with movies or music. But there are those times when I can recall every image, every word, and every feeling I had in a given moment. One of those times was a Sunday evening in November of 89. 

My mother had started volunteering at our town’s community theatre, and I begged her to tag along. I didn’t want to stay home with my dad. He was a rabid disciple of the Dallas Cowboys, and things had not gone well for them all season. That day was no exception. Rather than watching my father pout, I opted to spend time in a dusty old theatre while my mother sat in the office for a board meeting.

The auditorium was enormous to me back then. Faded red fabric lined the walls, and tasteless mismatched sconces were precisely spaced along them, all of which were finished in glossy gold paint in a desperate attempt to give the illusion of uniformity. Rows of old squeaky hardwood chairs were staggered, and their cushions were beat to hell. Most of them showed signs of sloppy stitch work here and there. It was a volunteer theatre after all, and when a new person walked through the doors ready to help, they were instantly thrust into all manner of craft and care, regardless of their skill level.

That’s the wonderful thing about a community theatre, the people who participate are just as garish, loud, and discrepant as the scavenged furnishings and props within it. The only similarity is the one that counts, this unexplainable need to put on a show, to spend the meagre amount of free time they have so an audience can walk through the doors and forget life for a bit.

The auditorium held four hundred people, and the concrete floor sloped unevenly down to a battered old stage. The apron was curved and the scalloped trim that hid the footlights had been pieced together by hand. Two faux columns held up the arch on either end, and the whole thing was painted a true white, while the grooves and lines were detailed in gold.

There were two side stages on either end. Both of them, as well as the main stage, were covered by red threadbare curtains. That night I had brought my toys, and I began to let the Batmobile race down the sloped floor, fleeing a hail of imaginary bullets being fired from the Joker and Bob the goon. The only sound in the whole place was that of plastic tires rattling over the thin spider web of cracks in the concrete. 

I thought I was alone. I know now, you’re never alone in a theatre.

I ran down the aisle to grab my favorite toy when all of the stage lights began to shine. The curtains opened, and the clickety clackity sounds the rollers made echoed through the auditorium. The set was almost complete, a saloon festooned with exaggerated trappings of a melodramatic vision of the old west. A large bar ran the length of stage left, and the brass kickbar at the bottom shimmered in the multicolored lights. Breakaway tables and chairs littered the stage, and the back wall was decorated in a mint green patterned wallpaper that was peeling in places. Windows on the back flats looked out on a painted background of a desert, replete with cartoonish cacti and fluffy clouds scattered over a too blue sky.

A man walked on stage.

He was dressed in a black suit, with white spats over his shiny shoes. He held a cane topped with a curved silver snake and a felt top hat sat crooked upon his head. An oiled mustache overshadowed his thin lips and it rolled back on it itself at the edges. A perfect representation of a dastardly cad. A slimy schemer who wouldn’t think twice of tying a helpless woman to the tracks of a train.

He launched into a roguish recitation, detailing his despicable dark deeds. I stood there, enthralled by the performance, seduced by the sound of his voice, the rises and falls, the flourish of his limbs, and the way he seemed to float back and forth across the stage. When he had reached the end of his murderous monologue of machinations, he burst into a boisterous bout of laughter most foul, and then fell silent for a moment once I caught his eye.

“Hey there, Buddy! What are you doing here?” He spoke in a warm baritone of whiskey and sand.

“I’m just playing.”

“Me too. I’m Roger. You’re Nell’s kid, huh?” I nodded my head. “I understand you want to make movies someday.” I nodded again. “Have you ever been on the stage?” 

“No, sir.”

“Come on up!” He motioned toward the stairs off the edge of the apron. 

“Ok.”

I wasn’t supposed to talk to strangers, but this was obviously someone my mother knew. I did as he asked. My eyes took a moment to adjust to the stage lights. The auditorium in front of me was gone, replaced by reds and blues and greens. Roger knelt down next to me.

“Everybody wants the movies kid, but this is where the real magic is. You can be whoever you want to be up here, but that’s not the special part. What do you see out there?”

“I can’t see anything but the lights.”

“Yep. Anybody could be out there. Could be hundreds, could be a few. Could be someone who will whisk you away to fame and fortune or it could be a family with nothing looking for an escape. Doesn’t matter. They all want the same thing. Magic. 

You come up here and play your part to the hilt. You can hear their seats squeak, the quiet rustle of popcorn bags, the gasps, the hisses and the boos, and that pounding in your heart during an awkward silence when someone forgets a line.

Boom

Boom

Boom

Boom

You can feel them hanging on every word. The air is thick with make believe.

Your nose is filled with the smells of sweat and makeup. The feel of ill fitting costumes and props held together by painted tape. You can see the scratches and divots on the boards, left behind by those who came before. There’s a freedom on the stage that you can’t find anywhere else. You lose yourself in it.”

I remember it all, word for word. When he was finished, he stood up.

“You wanna see something really neat?”

I followed him to the side stage. A small gallows was built. The noose that hung down was swaying, but there was no breeze.

“They kill me off at the end of this one.” He held my hand and we walked up the steps to the platform. “Perfectly safe. It’s a trick, but the audience has no idea how it’s done. I’ll show you how it works.”

He reached up and pulled the rope down and put it around my neck. I was in a dream, transfixed by his performance. He stood back and looked at me.

“Perfect. Now I want you to look scared. Yep… just like that, but you gotta turn toward the audience. You gotta open up.”

I did as he said. I imagined an audience out there, sitting on the edge of their seats, just waiting to see what would happen next.

“All you have to do is pull that lever over there.” I looked at the wooden lever just to the side of me.

“Then what?”

“Then the magic happens.” I hesitated. “It’s ok, kid. Trust me.”

I pulled the lever and the platform fell underneath me. I felt the rope snap. My feet were kicking and my hands clawed at the rope around my neck. I tried to scream out, but I could only gasp. I looked to Roger for help, but he wasn’t there anymore. I looked back out at the auditorium, and I swear out there past the lights, I could see the silhouettes of at least a dozen people watching me slowly choke to death, and then everything went dark.

I woke up in the hospital. I told my parents what happened, but I could tell they didn’t believe me.

Apparently the set designer had not yet built the hidden safety platform into the gallows. Nobody had any idea of how long I hung from that rope.

I was told later that “Roger” was the name of one of the theatre ghosts. A performer who passed away in 1977 who always played the villain. He would ride to every performance on his motorcycle dressed in character. On the opening night of The Shame of Tombstone, he lost control of his motorcycle and was decapitated as he slid underneath a logging truck. Legend says he stalks the theatre, filled with rage that he never got to give his performance.

My mother quit, and for the longest time, I wasn’t allowed anywhere near that building. I didn’t say anything to anybody else. As far as everyone was concerned, I was a stupid kid who made a stupid mistake.

Call me crazy, but when I turned eighteen, I went back. I auditioned for a play and got the lead. In spite of what happened to me, I still felt the call to that place. There was something inside that never let go. Something that told me I’d find my destiny on that stage, in spite of the fear over what happened.

I never saw Roger again and I never realized my dream of making it in the movies, but I met the love of my life on those old boards in 96. After almost thirty years, I wouldn’t change a damn thing. Follow the thing that calls you even if you’re afraid of it. You probably won’t end up with what you expected. You might just end up with something even [better](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyhorribles/).
