Of the dozen kids who were living at the Hallowed Hills group home, it was just my luck that I had to be the one to find Director Grant’s body.

I was so young at the time, I couldn’t understand what I was looking at, at first. It didn’t seem real. His skin was so smooth and pallid and white, it didn’t seem like it ever could have belonged to a living thing. And his eyes. He had these smooth, foggy eyes, like glass stained with dust, staring off into the distance at nothing in particular. Like a doll’s eyes. So I walked up to the assistant director, tugged at her skirt, and told her that someone had made a strange doll in Grant’s likeness. 

I only really understood that something was wrong when she started screaming.

Whenever I tell this story, people expect me to have been traumatized to my core… but really, it wasn’t all bad. The police took me into a comfy little room, gave me a free capri-sun, and let me play a Game Boy for the first time in my life, which I was pretty thrilled about. They tried to talk to me gently and soothingly, using euphemisms, but I told them I understood the concept of death. Director Grant was gone, and he wouldn’t be coming back ever, ever, ever, and I wasn’t really sad about it. 

They asked why, and I started telling them how he’d treated us in life. And the more I said, the more they got this funny look on their faces. One started whispering to the other, started writing something down. I didn’t understand their expressions then, but of course I do now, looking back.

They asked me, in veiled language, if I saw the person who had killed him, and I told them I hadn’t. But I was lying, of course. For as they were leading me out of the building, I just so happened to glance up at the group home’s roof, and caught the faintest trace of a silhouette stood by the chimney, backlit by an instant’s flash of lightning. It was the figure of a woman, her hands clasped over her chest, and a pair of wings folded behind her back.

I had always called her my guardian angel. Mister Grant, that rotten old bastard, had assumed she was just my imaginary friend. I guess he found out, in his last moments, just how wrong he’d been.

I didn’t see her for a long time after that. She kind of faded away, becoming a creepy little story I’d tell at parties. Life in the foster system didn’t leave too much time for studying, but I at least had a natural gift in athletics. For my junior year of high school, I took up boxing as a hobby — no, not a hobby. A way of life, a raison d’être, hell, practically a religion. I was a step away from praying to the poster of Floyd Mayweather Jr. on my bedroom wall.

And all I thought I wanted in life was the chance to beat… God, it hurts to even mention him, even after all these years. Ethan. My rival, my nemesis. Back then, I thought that I absolutely hated his guts. Looking back, he was the best friend I ever had. Either way, I was thrilled when I finally bulked up enough to match his weight class. I didn’t even care about winning the invitational. I just thought this was my big chance to finally kick his ass.

Hah. Yeah, right. It was a massacre. He dragged me up and down the ring from bell to bell. Stubborn as I was, I only stayed down once he hit me hard enough to break my nose and leave me concussed. My friends told me afterward that my face looked like a smashed tomato.

Honestly, he did me a favor. It sobered me up. Showed me that I wasn’t the hot shit I thought I was, and that the way I was living my life was going to come around and bite me in the end. So eventually, after a lot of thinking, I actually made up my mind to go and thank him. But when I stopped by his dorm room that night, I found the door already hanging ajar. Moonlight poured in through a broken window, the ghostly blue cutting through the darkness.

I thought that the thing standing in that utter dark was a statue, at first. The skin under all that muck was so calcified and hard and pale, it couldn’t possibly be anything organic. But then, her gaze slowly lifted to meet mine.

Have you ever seen those photos of statues left to spend years beneath the ocean? The way their colors and details fade, get chipped away, replaced with a thick coat of algae and barnacles and the assorted sickly green viscera of the sea. That’s almost what she looked like. The product of centuries of rot in the depths, time and the power of the deep sea melting away any features which could be called even vaguely human, leaving her with a face without a nose, arms without hands, something resembling coral jutting from her limbs and torso like cancerous growths, and I swear each of those sea-tumors was lined with throbbing veins beneath that thin green coat of biofilm.

Only two features identified her as any sort of organism. One was her mouth, which hung open in an almost comical matter, as if she were perpetually slack-jawed and stupefied — but really, I’m sure that whatever muscles held her lower jaw up had simply long rotted away. There was no tongue or throat or teeth in that mouth. Nothing at all, really. It opened up to absolute, inky blackness, as if it were a portal to some infinite void. Same with her two eyes. Perhaps they had once been detailed, but all but her pupils had been washed away, leaving a pair of tiny black pinprick eyes staring out of a perfectly smooth face.

Her jaws didn’t move an inch as she spoke. It was a deep, low sort of voice, as if her vocal chords were solid stone blocks that had been neglected for untold eons, finally being propelled to life, shaking off dust and cobwebs as they slowly ground against eachother. “He… hurt… you.”

And then the thing unfurled its immense wings, took off into the night sky, and disappeared.

I stood there for a small eternity, frozen in place. I didn’t dare to step into Ethan’s bedroom. I already knew what I was going to find. In my head, I could see Director Grant’s foggy gray doll eyes, staring out into the darkness, looking at nothing in particular.

I never stepped into the ring again, after that.

The cops were suspicious, but let me off in the end. After all, how could they prove I did it? No high schooler could have done that. It would’ve taken a world class surgeon to… to hollow out someone the way she did. But they didn’t need to punish me. I could punish myself just fine. I hermited away for a long time, never daring to leave my room on those few days I even left my bed. I felt like I could always hear Ethan’s voice in the back of my head. *This is all your fault,* it kept saying. *You must have sicced her on me. You were so mad you lost. You were always such a coward.*

I would have kept spiralling had I not eventually ended up in a psych ward. There, I met the psychologist who saved my life. She taught me that my guardian angel was just an instance of stress-induced psychosis. I’d found those two murdered in ways my mind could not square, and so it sort of filled in the blanks. Created a single malevolent I could blame it all on because, horrifying as it was, it was better than reckoning with the absolute random, meaningless chaos of the universe.

For a time, I actually got my life together. I got into college. I studied theology. I made friends. And I didn’t think about my guardian angel anymore… well. With one exception.

While studying the work of certain obscure Christian esotericists, I found theosophical texts that posed a novel twist on the concept of the elioud. These were the offspring of humans and the nephilim, the fallen angels that wandered the earth in antediluvian epochs. These texts immediately enchanted me, for his description of the elioud precisely matched my memories of my guardian angel.

He framed it not as a blessing, but a curse. A congenital disease, almost. Despised by God for being the product of an unnatural coupling, the elioud were doomed to feel all of His blessings slip away: their ability to move as their bones and flesh hardened like stone, their sanity as they were left paralyzed, unable to die, for unspeakable eternities. The section ended with a theatric flair: ᴛʜᴇʏ ᴡɪʟʟ ᴘʀᴀʏ ғᴏʀ ᴅᴇᴀᴛʜ, ᴀɴᴅ ᴅᴇᴀᴛʜ sʜᴀʟʟ ғʟᴇᴇ ғʀᴏᴍ ᴛʜᴇᴍ, ᴛʜᴏsᴇ sᴏɴs ᴏғ ʟɪʟʟɪᴛʜ, ʙᴇɢᴏᴛᴛᴇɴ ᴏғ ғᴀʟʟᴇɴ ᴀɴɢᴇʟs.

Is that was happened to her? Spending that eternity feeling her skin turn to stone, a prisoner within her own body. For the first time, I felt a flash of pity for my old guardian angel. But I quickly brushed it aside. After all, I reminded myself, it’s not as though she even actually exists.

During these few happy years of my life, only one event shook me. Once, in senior year, I was mugged on my way out of a bowling alley. He held me at knifepoint, told me to empty out my pockets. Wasn’t too big a deal. Only lost a few bucks. But then later, watching the news, a headline caught my eye: *Police baffled by man found exsanguinated in Maple Grove Park*. I rushed to change the channel before they had a chance to show the victim’s photo. I didn’t know if it had been my mugger, and I didn’t want to know. *It was probably someone else,* I told myself. *It doesn’t involve me.* I wanted my blissful ignorance to last forever.

But of course, it couldn’t. Nothing lasts forever. Or, at least, almost nothing.

But hey, at least I got my degree. Not too many kids from the foster system get to say that. And I even met Gracey along the way. Every time I could feel the depression or the fear creeping in, she was like the shot in the arm that got me going again. For the first time in my life, I was well and truly in love.

The other shoe dropped on what had, at first, seemed an ordinary day. Couldn’t have been more perfect, really, that beautiful blue sky over the humble little home we had together in the Sisquehanna Valley. It all started with such a simple thing. I’d come downstairs in the morning to find her looking groggy as she watched the birds out the back window, so I saw fit to wake her up with a surprise visit from the tickle monster. I might have been a little too sneaky. She was so startled she just about bowled me right over, and I busted my eyebrow open on the edge of the dining room table. No big deal. We patched it up, and forgot about it pretty much immediately.

Later that night, after work, I was sat on my favorite bench at Pinnacle Overlook, on the edge of a cliff with a gorgeous view of the lake below, while chatting with Gracey over the phone. We were rambling on about something unimportant, I think it was Penn State winning some big game, when all of a sudden, she let out this little yelp. “Christ!” There was a silence for a moment, and then I chimed in asking her what was wrong. “Nothing. It’s nothing. You know, um, the light in the backyard? It just turned on all of a sudden. It startled me, that’s all.”

I groaned. The light was motion activated, so I already knew what it probably meant. “Oh, God. It’s probably the damn raccoons trying to get into our garbage again,” I said. “You remember the mess they made last time. Can’t you scare them off?”

She hesitated. Usually, I had to deal with any raccoon problems. I knew she hated those things, ever since she read some study about how 1 in 10 of them were rabid. “Baby…”

I sighed. “I promise, they’re not going to give you rabies. You just have to shout at them. You don’t even have to get close.” And eventually, after enough reassurance, I convinced her to walk out back and check.

Unfortunately, due to the shape of the house, you couldn’t see the whole backyard from the window. You had to go out and round a corner to see where we kept our trash cans. As she stepped slowly out into that muggy July air, I started to get a strange feeling, myself.

Something wasn’t right. I knew that on a deep, instinctive level, even if I couldn’t quite articulate why. She was already rounding the corner of the house when I realized it: it was so *quiet*.

I mean, it was a hot Pennsylvania summer. The nighttime air should be filled with the absolute cacophony of crickets and katydids, not to mention wood frogs and owls and whatever else lurked in the night. But there was nothing. Besides Gracey’s timid footsteps, the line was utterly silent. As if the entire forest behind our house was holding its breath.

That put the hair on the back of my neck on end, and for a moment, I almost started begging her to go back inside. But I didn’t. I thought it would come off as… I don’t know. Childish. It’s a mistake that will haunt me for the rest of my life.

Suddenly, there was another noise. The sound of something shifting about inside of the garbage bin, that familiar scratching of something rooting about within, digging through old bags. So it had just been a raccoon after all. I supposed that should’ve soothed me, but it didn’t. I was still on edge as I listened to her shout into the night, trying to make enough noise the scare the little critter away. Nothing worked. So slowly, hesitantly, that scuttering noise grew louder and louder as she slowly approached the bin.

And then, the instant she peeked over the edge, the entire line went silent. I even had to glance at my phone to make sure she hadn’t hung up on me. I strained my ears for the slightest hint of sound, asking her what was going on. There must have been more terror in my voice than I’d intended, as she was giggling when she finally answered. “Nothing. Nothing, it’s alright. There wasn’t even a raccoon in here. It must have been nothing.”

For a moment, I was overcome by relief. And then she said something else. “Heh. Baby, I don’t mean to pry into your business, but you have some weird hobbies.”

I paused. “What?”

“I mean, what is this thing that you threw away?” I heard a rummaging again. “It looks like some kind of screwed up mannequin. And, oh, God, it smells *awful*. What have you been doing with it?”

Suddenly, I felt so terribly, horribly cold. It felt like ice was flooding through my veins. I stood up from the bench in an instant, without even thinking of it, struggling to keep a good grip on the phone with my shaking hands. “Honey. Get back into the house,” I said, trying desperately to keep my voice from breaking. “Did you hear me? Get back in the house and lock the doors, okay?”

Poor Gracey seemed baffled. She backed a couple of steps away from the garbage bin, her tone brimming with fear and confusion in equal measures. “What? What are you talking about, baby? You’re scaring —”

*Scaring*. That was the last word I ever heard from her. Well, kind of. In my darker nights, I still listen to old videos of her sometimes, or voicemails she left reminding me to pick up groceries or something. But the final thing she ever said to me was just how terrified she was, moments before there came the sound of stone scraping against stone, and all I heard from her then was the very start of a scream before the line cut out. “No!” I was shouting into the dead line, uselessly. “No, God damn it, *no*!”

I drove like a madman back to the house. It was only through sheer luck that I didn’t wrap myself around a tree. When I made it to the backyard, I found signs of a struggle. The garbage bin torn to bits, patio furniture knocked over, scratch marks in the very asphalt. The thing had chased her into the house.

The thing had chased her into the house. I stood there, staring into the ajar back door which seemed to open up into nothing but absolute blackness, as if it were the same void I’d seen in the creature’s eyes. I was shaking like a child as I stepped slowly closer, stupidly calling out her name into the dark. Were it for anybody else but Gracey, there was no way in hell I ever would have stepped through that door. 

But I did. And as I drew closer and closer to the living room, I heard it. That horrible *shllllh, shlllh, shllllh*, like someone trying to suck air through a tiny straw.

It was only then, when I laid eyes on it in the living room, that I realized how massive the thing truly was. It had to hunch over such that its head wouldn’t brush against the ceiling, and Gracey’s body looked like a doll as it hung limp in one of its hands, flopping about with its movements. It turned, slowly, to face me, staring me down with those beady little slits that were eyes, somehow blacker than the darkness all around them. 

And from its mouth jutted… a proboscis. A veiny, fleshy red tube, like a butterfly’s or a mosquito’s, but about the length and girth of a man’s arm. It had punched a fist-sized hole in Gracey’s neck, her head lulled to the side at an unnatural angle, leaving the appendage barely visible under the curtain of her long black hair. The proboscis visibly bulged round and taut for a moment with each fresh gulp of blood and viscera, each time releasing that horrible *shllllh, shlllh, shllllh*. And each drop of blood seemed to revitalize it, restoring movement to its stony body like grease being poured upon the inner workings of a rotting, rusty machine.

I fell to my knees. I screamed and sobbed and beat my chest. It seemed to startle the creature. There was no expression on that motionless face, but there was a sort of anxious guilt in its movements, like that of a dog that knew it had done something to anger its master but not understanding exactly what. It spoke in that slow, horrible drawl, as if to defend itself. “She… hurt… you.”

I went charging at it, pounding my fists against its rotten, ancient chest, even if the blows hurt me more than it. I was screaming at it until my throat felt torn to ribbons, asking why it couldn’t just leave me alone, why it had to do this. And in response, it dropped Gracey’s body limply to the floor… and reached its immense arms around me, as if to cradle me against its chest. Its voice lowered to a whisper.

“Mommy… loves… you.”

That stole the breath from my lungs, and the fire from my belly. I just stood there, stunned into silence, as it wrapped me in its hug, cradling me against its cool, solid body. And then those wings unfolded once more, and it took off again into the night.

I guess it was taking some time to set in. She wasn’t the elioud. I was.

I apologize if I’ve made any errors in writing out this account. Truth is, it’s just gotten so hard to type. Over the years, my joints have become more rigid and inflexible, my fingers impossible to bend, my skin hardening and becoming impliable. Bit by bit, day by day, I’ve come to feel more and more like a prisoner in my own body. It won’t be long until I’ve lost the ability to move completely.

I’ll be honest: I’ve tried everything I could think of to end it all. I’ve tried desperately to find some way to die before it’s too late, and I become unkillable. Immortal. It’s so hard for human minds to even imagine that… the idea of eternity.

Just the other day, I managed to throw myself off that cliff over the sea. I don’t even know why I bothered. I knew exactly how it would end, after all. The same way it always does: with the sound of the beating of her wings, her arms catching me gently and cradling me against her, and her voice whispering adoringly in my ear.

“Mommy… loves… you.”
