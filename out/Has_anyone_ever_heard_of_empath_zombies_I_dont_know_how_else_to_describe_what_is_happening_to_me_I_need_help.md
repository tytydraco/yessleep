I’m writing this from a hospital waiting room because they told me not to move for a while after the scan, and because if I wait any longer, I’m afraid I won’t remember which thoughts are actually mine.

It happened this morning. They put me in the MRI machine.

They told me not to move.  
Not an inch.  
Not even to breathe too deeply.

The tube clicked and roared around me like I was trapped inside a rusted engine waking from a long sleep. The hum was constant—old music in a bad key. It didn’t hurt, but it made me acutely aware that I was being examined from the inside out.

I let my mind drift back to the chain of small events that led me there.

Two weeks ago, an ER doctor in Maine told me I had Bell’s Palsy. He said it was benign. Temporary. The feeling in my face was already coming back. I could almost smile evenly again.

That wasn’t what kept me awake at night.

It was everything else.

The static interference in my thoughts.  
The pressure in my jaw.  
The heat in my teeth.  
The empty feeling where my sense of self should have been.

And Allison. Still missing. My sister Hannah and I had been searching for her when half my face stopped working four days ago. We came back home to Topeka.

A voice crackled through the MRI speaker.

“Alright, Lily. We’re going to show you a few images now. Some may be distressing. You don’t need to do anything. Just lie still.”

It felt like I was entering a portal to nowhere. And then everywhere, once the screen above me lit up.

A picnic basket.  
A puppy, head cocked sideways.  
A little girl holding birthday balloons.

Then:

A burned hand.  
A crying mother.  
A terrified child.

Then:

A gunshot to the face.

I didn’t blink—but my body reacted anyway. Goosebumps rippled down my arms. Something twisted deep in my chest, like the echo of someone else’s pain passing straight through me.

I tasted copper.

Before the feeling could settle, I blacked out.

When I came back, I was still in the tube.

I didn’t scream.  
I didn’t cry.

I felt everything—phantom pain crawling through my body like my nerves were relaying warnings meant for someone else.

Then another image appeared.

The Tower.

I didn’t see all of it—just the top third, frozen in grainy archived footage. Twisting metal. Impossible structure that wouldn't sit still in my head.

The moment it appeared, everything inside me went quiet.

My breathing slowed.  
My heart rate dropped.  
The tension I hadn’t known I was carrying drained away.

That was the first moment I realized something was wrong.

My brain didn’t register the Tower as trauma or fear.

I heard myself whisper, though I don’t remember deciding to speak.

“It’s just a puzzle. I can solve a puzzle.”

After the scan, they led me into a small white exam room.

Popsicle sticks in a jar.  
Blood pressure cuff hanging limp.  
Carpet that seemed to breathe if I stared at it too long.

Dr. Forscher sat on a rolling stool. His smile was too symmetrical—geometry pretending to be friendly. He held his clipboard like a detective holding a case file.

“You’re doing very well,” he said. “You’ve regained facial control.”

I nodded. I wanted to ask if I’d passed. I wanted to ask what the test even was.

Instead, he said, “Let’s begin. I’ll ask some questions. You’ll answer honestly.”

Like a job interview.  
Or confession.

“Have you experienced any unnatural sensations in the past two weeks?”

“Unnatural how?”

“I’d rather you define it.”

“Yes,” I said. “Tingling. Pressure. Heat. In my teeth.”

He wrote something down.

“Any pain that doesn’t belong to you?”

I froze.

“What do you mean?”

“You know what I mean,” he said calmly. “Pain felt, though unearned.”

“…Yes.”

“What triggers it?”

“People. Images. Emotions.”

“Yours?”

I shook my head. “Other people’s.”

He nodded. “Do you see movement where there is none?”

“Mirrors. Ceiling fans when they’re off. Shadows moving backward.”

“Do you dream other people’s memories?”

“I don’t sleep much.”

“That’s not what I asked.”

“…Yes.”

“Hallucinations?”

“I thought so,” I said. “But hallucinations aren't supposed to leave marks.”

That made him stop writing.

He turned his laptop toward me.

My MRI scan filled the screen—bright clusters lighting up my brain in repeating patterns. Too precise. Too organized. A perfect fractal.

“You’re showing rapid proliferation of mirror neurons in the sensory cortex,” he said.

“Mirror neuron what?” It sounded made up.

“Mirror neurons are how we learn through observation,” he said. “Empathy. Anticipation. Simulation.”

“So… being human.”

“Yes,” he said. Then paused. “Until they stop knowing where you end.”

He zoomed in. The clusters weren’t staying contained.

“They’re migrating,” he said. “Toward the motor cortex.”

“That’s movement,” I said. “Choice.”

“Yes.”

“What happens when they get there?”

He hesitated—just long enough to scare me.

“At that point,” he said, “the distinction between observing and acting begins to dissolve.”

“That’s just empathy,” I said. “People talk about that all the time.”

“This is not empathy,” he said. “This is identity erosion.”

He pointed back to the scan. “If the spread continues, your nervous system will stop reliably distinguishing between internal intention and external experience.”

I swallowed. “So what does that mean?”

“It means selfhood becomes negotiable.”

“And if it doesn’t stop?”

His voice lowered. “Empathy will stop being something you feel.”

“And become…?”

“Something you are.” He sounded cold--detatched, "Just a reflection."

Silence filled the room.

“At a certain point,” he continued, “you will no longer be capable of separating yourself from others. Their fear will feel like instructions. Their pain like memory. Their movements like impulse.”

I felt cold.

“So I won’t be me.”

“You will exist,” he said gently. “But not as a fixed point.”

He rested a hand on my shoulder. I hated how real that made everything feel.

As I stood to leave, he paused.

His mouth didn’t move.

But I heard it anyway.

*Do you know who you are?*

I didn’t answer.

Something else did.

It wasn’t until I was back in the waiting room that something small finally clicked.

I don’t remember checking in.

I don’t remember giving my name.  
Or my date of birth.  
Or my insurance.

No clipboard.  
No bracelet.  
No intake questions.

They had just… called me back.

And now I’m sitting here, watching people walk past me, feeling their tension ripple through my body like borrowed motives.

So if anyone has heard of a zombie like state of empathy—  
people who don’t lose consciousness,  
just origin—

I think that might be what I’m becoming.
