 

I followed her like I did most nights—first a few car lengths behind until she parked, and then on foot—far enough back I could blend into a crowd or patch of shadows if she started to look my way. 

 

But no, she was focused tonight.  One hand was gripping the strap of the bag she had slung across her back and the other was clenched down at her side.  She was moving at a good speed too, cutting across a parking lot and then a side street before suddenly heading back in my general direction on the far sidewalk. 

 

Heart hammering, I ducked my head and tried to look casual as I went into the nearest store.  It was a small, dingy convenience store, and I made a show of looking at a rack of dusty-looking gum while watching her continue down the sidewalk a bit more before stepping into a gap between two buildings and out of view.

 

“Fuck.”  I muttered it under my breath, but still winced at the sound as soon as it escaped me.  I needed to stay unnoticed and unremarkable to everyone, not just her.  Lurking in the front of a store and cursing weren’t helping that. 

 

Pushing the thought away, I went back outside and cut across the street.  She was farther ahead, almost out of sight, but I was close enough to see her duck through a break in a security fence and disappear.  What was she doing?  She’d never deviated out of her routine like this before.

 

As I drew closer to the fence, I slowed down a little.  I was still about fifty feet back from where I thought she went through, but from the outside, this entire long fence seemed to go around the same property.  Most of it was covered by a combination of chain link and faded blue tarps, but in some spots there were holes big enough to look through.

 

Glancing around, I saw no one else in sight.  I took a deep breath and bent down a bit, looking through a sizeable tear to see if I could catch a glimpse of her or where she was going.  I saw her almost immediately. 

 

She was down on her knees, using a small shovel to dig a hole in the back corner of the weed-choked lot.  Wiping sweat from my eyes, I watched her work for the next few minutes until she seemed satisfied with her work.  Then, pulling a dark box from her backpack, she seemed to put it in the hole before using the shovel to bury it there.  What was this?  Some secret stash?

 

Before long she was done with her work and stood up, stretching her back before putting the shovel in the bag and heading back toward the security fence.  I moved away from the hole quietly and backtracked to around the corner of the lot.  Using my phone to peek out around the edge of the fence, I saw her starting to move away down the street.  I felt a moment of indecision.  Did I stay or go? 

 

Better to ask.

 

Pulling up my texts, I sent a short message:

 

*She’s buried something in a lot.  Do you want me to keep following her or investigate what’s in the lot?*

 

Almost immediately I got a reply.

 

**Make note of the burial spot so you can find it again, but keep following her.**

 

Giving a thumbs up emoji, I stuffed my phone back in my pocket and stepped back onto her trail.

 

\*\*\*\*

Late last year I lost my job, and a couple of months later I got a job at a furniture store selling chairs and mattresses and dinette sets.  Not my dream, but it would be fine if we had more customers.  As it is, I wind up working odd jobs to make up for my commissions’ shortfalls.  It keeps me pretty busy, but I don’t mind.  I do most of it through one of those gopher contractor websites—you know, the type where people are looking for someone to do something that either requires specific skills or knowledge or something that they can’t or don’t want to do themselves.  I’ve cleaned out garages, gotten groceries, even organized an old lady’s closet by color and season (with a lot of help from her).  There’s variety, most people are nice enough, and sometimes the money is even worth the time and effort.

 

There was nothing especially unique about Connie’s listing—it just said she needed help with some “life stuff” before a big move.  I figured it would be packing or cleaning or errands, all of which was fine so long as it stayed reasonable for the pay.  When I sent in my interest notification, she responded almost immediately, asking if I could come by for an interview the following day.

 

It was a little odd, but not unheard of.  The pay was good and her apartment was in a rich part of town, so maybe she wanted to weed out people that might steal from her or something.  When I went the next morning, I had to knock for a couple of minutes before she came to the door.  Laughing, she waved me in, apologizing for not coming sooner.

 

“Henry…he’s that stern guy that let you up downstairs…he texted me you were here—I’d already let him know to expect you, of course.  But I didn’t hear my phone and I’ve been running around so much and…”  She let out an exasperated sigh.  “Anyway, sorry I’m so scattered.  Glad to meet you, Madison.”

 

I smiled and shook her extended hand.  She was probably in her mid-thirties, only a few years older than me, but she seemed so different.  More adult and refined, beautiful and confident but not condescending.  I was a little intimidated, but I still liked her right away.

 

“Um, no that’s no problem.  It sounds like you’ve got a ton going on.  You’re moving, right?”

 

She rolled her eyes.  “No, not me.  I’m trying to make some new arrangements for a couple of family members though, and it’s wall-to-wall details.  Then there’s my sister, Abby.  I’d like to get her to move too, but one step at a time.”  Connie smiled again.  “Which that is actually what I…wait, I’m getting ahead of myself.  Come sit down and tell me more about Madison.”

 

Over the next twenty minutes we talked about the details of my life.  Where I grew up, that I had a sister and two parents who all lived a couple of hours north and who I didn’t see as much as I should.  Where I’d gone to school and worked, even what kinds of movies and t.v. shows I liked.  It was all done in a very casual, conversational way, but by the end I realized I’d told her a lot.  Enough, it seemed, because suddenly she shifted gears again.

 

“So Maddy, I think you’re a great fit for this.  I can tell you’re a good and responsible person.  Someone I can trust.  And I need just that for what I’m going to ask you to do.”

 

I nodded, more than a little curious what the job was by this point.  “Okay, thanks.  What kind of work did you need?”

 

She bit her lip slightly, hesitating before throwing herself into a fast, flowing answer.  “Well, my sister that I mentioned before?  She’s my baby sister, right?  A wonderful girl.  Very smart and talented.  But, well…the last couple of years she’s fallen in with kind of a seedy crowd.”  Connie stopped, her eyes widening.  “I don’t mean, like, because they aren’t rich.  God no, I’m not a bitch.”  She gestured around her.  “I have this shit because my parents died early and loaded, not because I’m special.”  Giving an embarrassed-sounding laugh, she went on.  “But these people…she started dating this guy, Rex.  Real piece of shit.  He cheated on her, she found out after a year, broke up with him.  Then the real problems started.”

 

I frowned.  “What?  Did he start stalking her or something?”

 

She shook her head as she gave a small, angry snort.   “Not him.  The bitch he was running around with.  She’s crazy or something.  Started showing up outside my sister’s job, her apartment, you name it.  She’s smart enough to not make any direct threats, but she’s still stalking her.”

 

“Did she call the cops?”

 

“Finally, when I made her.  For all the good it did.  They basically blew it off.  Said there’s been no threats or attempts to hurt her, and no corroboration that she’s even following her around.  I think the real reason is because she’s a girl and they don’t take her seriously.  Either of them.  Just girls fighting over a boy, you know the bullshit.”  Connie raised her hand.  “And let me be clear.  I don’t think this girl is actually dangerous.  I think she’s just fucked up and obsessed.  But that doesn’t stop it from driving my sister crazy.  I need to get proof of what she’s doing so I can get it to stop.”

 

I nodded.  “I understand.  But um, what does that have to do with me?”

 

Connie grinned.  “I want you to follow this girl for a few weeks.  Not stalk her.  Let me be clear.  I’m not asking you to do anything illegal.  I don’t want her harassed or you go anywhere you’re not allowed to go, that kind of thing.  And she doesn’t know you, so she can’t be intimidated just because she might see you around from time to time.”  She blinked.  “Which, I mean, the idea is still not to be seen.  This is like you’re a private detective on a stake-out or something, right?  Just keeping track of where she goes when you have time.  Usually early morning and early evening are the main times she’s fucking with my sister.   Anyway, after a few weeks of that, when it looks like there’s enough proof that she’s stalking my sister, I can get you to write out an affidavit describing what you’ve observed.  I can give that, along with my own affidavit, to the police, and maybe then they’ll feel enough pressure to arrest her and make her stop for good.”  She paused, staring at me for a moment.  “Does that sound cool to you?”

 

I stared back for several seconds, trying to collect my thoughts before responding.  “I mean…maybe?  I just…are you sure there’s nothing wrong with me doing this?”

 

She nodded.  “Totally sure.  I asked our lawyer and everything.  Like I said, so long as you don’t interact with her, mess with her or her stuff, or like, trespass anywhere, you should be cool.  Hopefully she won’t even know you’re ever there until it’s too late.  Or better yet, maybe you watch her and she calms her tits and leaves my sister alone.”

 

I slowed returned the nod.   “Yeah, I mean, I’d like to help.  But it sounds super weird.”

 

Connie’s smile fell away, her eyes growing sad.  “Look, Maddy.  I’ll be honest with you.  This…this whole thing isn’t easy for me.  I don’t trust people easily, and I don’t like asking for help.  But talking to you, I can tell you’re someone I can rely on and trust.  I really want it to be you that does this for me.”

 

I sighed.  “I mean, I know, but…”

 

“I forgot to mention the per diem.”

 

“Huh?”

 

She grinned again.  “Well, I know you get paid for jobs you accept through the app company or whatever, but I’d want to give you extra money in cash for every day you follow her.  For food, gas, and your time.  An extra $100 for every hour, if that sounds fair.”  I went to respond when she stopped me.  “And I know this sounds like I’m bribing you, and it’s because I am.  I was planning on doing $25 an hour, but that’s before I met you.  Please, help me out, Maddy.”

 

It sounded too good to be true, but was it?  Despite what she was saying, there was some risk in taking the job.  If the girl noticed me, she could flip out and attack me or call the cops regardless of what Connie’s lawyer may think on the subject.    

 

“It’s…that’s a lot of money, at least to me.”

 

Connie waved the idea away.  “Listen, you can’t live like that.  I used to be like that, and it’s a negative way of thinking.  Appreciate the good luck when it comes.  This is what we deserve.”

 

I nodded.  “I guess.”

 

“No, say it with me.  This is what we deserve.”

 

I looked down at my feet.  “This is what we deserve.”

 

If I was careful and didn’t get noticed, and if I didn’t do anything that broke the law…it *was* a lot of money.  And I got to help her and her sister.  And…weird as it sounded, it might even be fun.

 

Meeting her eyes, I nodded.  “Okay, I’ll try it.  So long as it doesn’t get too intense or weird.”

 

Connie lunged forward to give me a big hug.  “Oh, thank you!  No, it’ll go great!  I promise it’ll be awesome.”  When she finally let me go, she pulled out her phone to check something before looking back to me.  “Can you start tonight?”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

The first night was hard.

 

Connie was great giving me all the information I’d need.  Where to find the woman—her name was Sally—what she looked like, what she drove, where she worked…she even had a rough schedule of where she tended to be when, though Connie said it was mostly guesswork based on the times she was messing with her sister and that Sally’s job was working as a temp at a normal 9 to 5.

 

I normally got off at the furniture store around 4, so I went home, changed and grabbed something to eat before heading over to her apartment.  I was already parked down the street when I saw her car come by.  She turned into a small lot of private spaces that I couldn’t see from my vantage point, but thankfully she came back toward the front office to check her mail before heading into her apartment.

 

It was definitely her.  She didn’t look weird or crazy or anything, but then how would I know?  And even if she was perfectly normal and Connie was the weird one, what did it matter?  I wasn’t doing anything wrong and I was getting paid well to hang out and walk around a little.  A great deal while it lasted.

 

I kept repeating those thoughts throughout that night like a mantra, a chant to steel my nerves when I started feeling nervous or guilty.  I sat there until after nine and was about to fall asleep in my car.  I’d planned to stay until midnight to maximize my money, but I was wondering if I’d make it past ten at the rate I was going.  It was all just so boring and I’d had a really long day.

 

Just then I saw Sally pulling back out of the lot.  Pulse quickening, I waited a few seconds and then followed her.

 

Just like with finding Sally, Connie had given me enough details about her sister that it wasn’t hard to tell where my meal ticket was going.  Sure enough, twenty minutes later she was sitting outside a condo that Connie had already told me belonged to her family.  Her sister had been living there since college and didn’t want to leave it even if it meant throwing her stalker off her trail.

 

Sally parked across the street in a small lot for the adjacent park, and I parked half a block down from that.  I laughed to myself a little at how ridiculous this all was.  All we needed was for Connie’s sister to head out and then we’d have a conga line of cars stalking each other.

 

I’d no longer finished the thought that I saw a woman walk out the lobby doors of the condominium.  I didn’t know what Connie’s sister even looked like, but Sally clearly did.  As soon as the woman got on her bike and headed out, Sally followed.  And, of course, I wasn’t too far behind.

 

This wound up being a short trip.  The sister was just going to pick up food and then was back, and by 11 Sally seemed satisfied with her evening’s work and headed home.  I forced myself to hang around Sally’s place until midnight and then I did the same.

 

After that, it got much easier.  I’d gotten a taste of how benign and boring it all was for one thing, and for another, I realized I kind of enjoyed it.  Sally was obviously kind of fucked up—in the first week alone she spent four nights lurking around Connie’s sister, whether she was at home, a bar, or over at someone else’s place.  Sally was clearly obsessed.

 

But at the same time, she hadn’t really *done* anything other than be a creeper, had she?  And I didn’t get the idea that Connie’s sister had even noticed her, so how much did it really hurt?  I started to sympathize with Sally a little bit.  Some troubled woman, probably being fucked with by this asshole dude they had in common, and she was coming out to lurk out this lady because she was sad and angry and wanted something in her life she could control. 

 

By the second week I looked forward to going out to stalk Sally—not because I wanted to make her life worse, but because I almost felt like I was performing some kind of service.  Providing some passive protection for Connie’s sister while giving Sally some needed companionship whether she knew I was there or not.

 

This went on for a month, and overall my life was going pretty well.  I was a bit sleep deprived, but my bills were getting paid and I woke up most days in a much better mood, even if the days themselves tended to drag until I was following Sally again.  And every week I’d go back to Connie and give her my notes and updates, copies of photos and videos I’d taken to prove everything I was doing and for how long, all the while dreading that she’d say that it was enough, that it was time to pull the plug and go to the police.

 

Every week she would thank me, hand me an envelope full of my per diem, and then she’d chit chat with me for a few minutes.  Asking how my family was doing, how I was enjoying the furniture store, things like that.  When that wind down, she’d give me a hug and tell me she’d see me again next week.

 

It was on the third day of the fifth week that Sally changed her routine.  I followed her to an abandoned lot where she buried a box, and then, at Connie’s instruction, I left the box and followed her home.

 

The next day, I couldn’t find Sally.  Not at her apartment, not at work, not at Connie’s sister’s place even.  I actually took off the day after to look around for her more, but no luck.  It wasn’t until the sixth day that she popped up again.  I first saw her coming out of her apartment—this was in the morning, which was unusual for me, but I’d called out of work for a second day to try and track her down. 

 

When I saw her, I immediately knew something was wrong.  I’d never spoken a word to her, but her body language and expression was different, and her face was drawn and haggard.  She looked like she hadn’t slept and had been crying a lot.  Why?

 

I had the insane urge to hop out of my car and go ask her.  Shaking my head, I watched her walk to her car’s trunk, get out a suitcase, and roll it back into her apartment.  So she’d gone on a trip or something?

 

I sat outside for another four hours, but she didn’t budge again.  It wasn’t until two days later that she started back to stalking Connie’s sister again.  That went on for another couple of days, and then she changed her schedule again.

 

She went off to the outskirts of town, an area I’d never seen her visit before.  Parking her car at a pharmacy, she walked off down a back street toward a rundown residential area.  It was hard to follow directly behind her on such a straight road, so I cut through areas close by, trying to keep her in view most of the time.  When she reached an old elementary school that looked closed down, she headed up the driveway, over a short fence and into what had once been a playground.  Stopping next to a jungle gym, she squatted down and began to dig with both hands.

 

It didn’t take long before she unearthed a metal box that was similar to the one I’d seen her bury a few days before.  I couldn’t see her face as she turned it over in her hands, but I could still make out the shuddering anger or fear that caused her to tremble as she studied it.  Standing up, she dug something out of her jeans—a small key maybe, because next she put her hand near the box and the lid popped open.

 

Sally took out several things one at a time.  Some looked like papers or photos, though I couldn’t say for sure at that distance and with a chainlink fence partially obscuring my view.  Another looked like a small cellphone.  She watched a video of some kind I think.  I could hear screaming on it.

 

She was shaking more as she turned away, stuffing something in her pocket while sticking the box under her other arm.  Glancing around, she suddenly dashed off toward the school buildings. 

 

I was torn as to whether to follow her or not.  On the one hand, I didn’t like the idea of being exposed going up to the school, and I had no idea where she was going.  On the other, I had no idea where she was going, and I didn’t want to lose track of her.

 

Grimacing, I ran across the street to the driveway, up and along the closest building on the opposite side from where she’d gone.  It looked like the school was made up of four long buildings that met in a large breezeway in the middle, so if I eased up to the corner I might see where she was going.  As I drew closer to the center, I saw a door on the far building had its window busted out and was sitting partially ajar.  I edged closer.  Had Sally really broken into…

 

I felt the barrel of a gun poke me in the ear.

 

“Why did you fucking do it?”

 

My bladder felt loose as I stifled a scream and rolled my eyes to the right.  It was Sally, red-faced and crying  with eyes filled with rage and murder.  The gun shuddered slightly along with the rest of her, but it was still pressed against my skull.

 

“J-just…Jesus…I…what did I do?”

 

She poked me harder with the gun.  “You fucking *know*.  Now get inside.”  She followed me through the broken door, gun pressed tight to the back of my head.  “My mama…you burned her alive.  I noticed you the last couple of weeks…I kept seeing you.  Thought maybe you were following me, but…I then I thought it was guilt.  Me being paranoid.  I…”

 

I turned enough to look at her out of the corner of my eye.  “What the fuck?  I haven’t hurt anybody.  I don’t even know your mama.”

 

Another poke.  “That’s not what the fucking *letter* said.  The photos of you.  The video of her burning and screaming.  I saw the bitch I’ve been following bury it, so maybe she’s in on it too.  But the box only talked about *you*, and I know *you’ve* been following *me*.”

 

I went to shake my head and stopped myself.  “I saw you bury a box too.  Why did *you* do it?”

 

She shrugged slightly as her frown deepened.  “My boss told me to.  Just like he had me follow this bitch that left the box.  Some jealous ex or something that cut his tires and was stalking him.”  Grimacing, she stabbed the gun into the side of my head again.  “And I’m not an idiot.  I see he’s part of this too.  And he’s going to get his.  But that doesn’t mean I’m going to let you get…”

 

Her words cut off as Connie slit her throat from behind.  A spray of blood shot across my neck and chest before I managed to get far enough back.  Sally was holding her throat, trying to keep the rest in, but it didn’t matter.  She met my eyes, stumbled once, twice, and then she toppled over.

 

“Take that sweatshirt off.  Rub your face, ear and hair with it.  It’ll blend in with your dark hair okay, but you can’t go back out looking like that.”

 

I wanted to argue, but the idea of having any more of the blood on me than I could help repulsed me, so I quickly stripped it off and scrubbed the side of my head with while staring at Connie.  She looked calm and composed, and other than a couple of small drops on her gloves, there wasn’t a sign of blood on her.

 

“What the fuck is this?”

 

She smiled.  “This is me saving your life.  She would have killed you.”

 

I glared at her.  “Because you put her up to it.”

 

Connie raised an eyebrow.  “I’ve never met this woman before in my life.”

 

“Then how did you know to come here to…”  I spat out a wad of blood into the sweatshirt before doing air quotes, “you know, ‘save me’”.

 

She laughed.  “Because I knew where you were, and I had gotten information that today you’d need my help.”

 

“That’s not an answer.”

 

Her face grew more serious.  “Because you’re not asking the right questions.  What you should be asking is why am I standing over a dead body and asking stupid questions instead of getting away from all of this.”

 

I felt my stomach clench.  She was lying to me, but not about that.  “What…what the fuck do we do?”

 

She pointed at me.  “You give me the sweatshirt.  Do not step in any blood as you leave.  Walk back to your car casually, avoiding any witnesses, and then you go the fuck home, burn your clothes and take a long shower.  I will take care of this.  No one is going to look here for anything when I’m done, and if they did, they won’t find anything connected to either of us.”  When she held out her hand for the sweatshirt, I handed it over.  “Sound good?”

 

I nodded.  “I mean, I guess?”

 

She sighed.  “Listen, I get that you don’t understand what’s going on.  That, hurtful as it is, maybe you don’t trust me right now.  But what choices do you have better than this?”

 

I frowned.  “What if you call the cops on me?  Frame me?  Or decide to kill me?”

 

Connie rolled her eyes.  “*Look*.  If I wanted to frame you, I wouldn’t be helping you cover this up.  I’d have slit her throat, run out and called 911.  Easy peasy.  And if I wanted to kill you?”  She chuckled.  “My SUV has plenty of storage.  Barely an inconvenience.”  She frowned at me and waved the hand holding the straight razor she’d used on Sally.  “Now shoo.”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

I did like she said.  For the next four days I waited for the cops to show up or for Connie to come and try to kill me.  I’d peer out my window every few minutes, looking for some sign that bad things were coming or that they were going to pass me by.  And for the first couple of days, I didn’t notice anything out of place.

 

And then I saw her.

 

She was a small girl—probably in her twenties, though it was hard to say for sure.  I’d never seen her before that I remembered, but now almost every time I looked outside there she was.  Sitting on a bench, hanging out in an old blue beater, walking up and down the street while casually glancing up at me from time to time. 

 

“Goddamnit.”

 

This was on the fourth day, and I was teetering on the edge between going out and confronting her and being too afraid to move when my phone buzzed.  It was a text message from Colin, a guy I used to date in college and hadn’t talked to in at least five years.

 

**Sorry for the blast from the past, but your sister found my number in one of your old cell phones.  She says she doesn’t have your current number and needs to talk to you.  Please call her.  Number is below.**

 

I swallowed.  Almost deleted the message and number.  And then I pressed it instead.

 

When she answered, she started crying.  I thought she’d be mad, blaming me for ghosting all of them, but no.  She was just sad and alone and wanting to tell her big sister that two weeks before, there was a fire at our parents’ house.  Police said it was most likely arson, but they were waiting on the final fire report.  Dad died right away, but Mom held on in the burn unit until this morning.  She didn’t know how to get me, and hadn’t known if she should even call, but after it was all done she thought of an old phone of mine I’d given her.  It still had my contacts mixed in with hers, and she found Colin.

 

I cried with her for a little while.  Told her I was sorry.  Told her I’d come home soon.  I hadn’t hung up the phone five minutes before a new text popped up, this one from Connie.

 

**Knock Knock.**

 

Outside my apartment door was a small metal box with a piece of tape on it that said “Bury me somewhere secret and safe.”  On top of the box was a small key with a tag attached that said “Keep me somewhere close and cozy.”  I tried to use the key to unlock the box, but of course it didn’t work.

 

**Bury it tonight in an place of your choosing.**

 

*No.  Fuck you.  I’m done.  You fucking murderer.*

 

**You’re still on the clock.  And I have detailed records of all the work you’ve done.  Do it.**

 

Twenty minutes later, I was carrying the box out to be buried.  When I looked back, the girl was following me.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

It was as I was walking back to my car from burying the box that a thought occurred to me.  I needed to get the other box, the one that Sally buried.  It would have the proof I needed to show that my parents were murdered, that there was some giant plot to manipulate and kill people.  It might even point to the girl following me as the killer, but that was probably a lie.  She was probably just an idiot like me getting played by…whatever this was.

 

Heart pounding, I drove across town, back to where I’d followed Sally that day.  I parked near the convenience store I’d hid in, cutting across and down the side street back to the long fence and the gap that led to the abandoned lot within.  As I passed into it, I glanced back and saw the girl slowly walking down the street.  That’s okay.  Let her come.  I would show her too.  I would show everybody and stop their sick game.

 

I was half-afraid the box would be gone, but it wasn’t.  My hands were shaking so bad I could barely get the key in, but when I did, the box opened right away.   There was less inside than I expected.  No letter or photos or weapon.  Just a small phone.  When I turned it on, rather than go to a home screen, a video started playing right away.

 

It was in my parents’ bedroom.  They were tied down, gagged but still screaming, as something was sloshed across them.

 

And then I heard my voice.

 

“Are you sure there’s nothing wrong with me doing this?”

 

A match was struck and flared to life in front of the camera.

 

“This is what we deserve.”

 

The match lit my parents on fire, and as I listened to them scream, sobbing and crying along with them, I realized I wasn’t alone.

 

The girl was standing a few feet away from me, gun in one hand and badge in the other.

 

“Madison, I’m going to need you to come with [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Verastahl/).”
