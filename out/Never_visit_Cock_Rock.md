I hate the name. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. Because that place is unnatural, dangerous, and it makes my stomach turn just thinking about it. And nobody takes me seriously, because it’s called Cock fucking Rock.

Officially it doesn’t have a name, it’s just a structure that’s part of a lava field plateau outside a city in Utah. I’m being vague so people don’t go looking. I only mention Utah to let people know that if you go hiking off the marked trails there, you’re in danger. I grew up in this area. At some point someone’s dad’s dad went hiking on the plateau and found a rock formation that looked like, well, a giant dick. The name Cock Rock was inevitable. The cherry on top was the fact that Cock Rock has a cave opening on the tip which is much taller than it is wide. There’s a lot of natural lava tunnels out there. So on the head of Cock Rock lies Dick Slit cave. Poetry. I guess high schoolers have changed surprisingly little since the 60’s. 

Visiting Cock Rock is a fairly popular thing to do in my high school, mostly for the juniors and seniors. It’s about an hour away so it’s not an insanely popular spot, but there’s not a ton to do out here so you can usually expect to hear a couple people at least talking about going down there on the weekend. 

The other reason for its local infamy are the disappearances. Once every couple years or so some senior heads out to Cock Rock and never comes back. The park service usually says they either got too drunk and wandered off, or they got too drunk and slipped in the cave for the animals to find. People wandering off the trails and dying of exposure or thirst (or one of the other million things that’ll kill you in nature) is not entirely uncommon, as sad as it is, but this place is different. Cock Rock has a mysterious reputation mostly because they’ve never recovered any of the bodies. I know why, now.

I’m a junior in high school along with my best friend Mac. Mac and I were always an unlikely pair, at least to me. I was always more of the poetry dork that guys like Mac pick on, while Mac was your classic wannabe class clown. Back in elementary school Mac lost his friend group, he said the assholes just didn’t like him anymore one day. That’s elementary kids for you I guess. Anyway, that’s when Mac and I started hanging out. Our dynamic was always that he’d go over the top, and I’d try to reel him in, while he’d do his best to bring me out of my shell.

Mac and I were born here, and have heard every local legend there is. Cock Rock was always our favorite, especially once we were old enough to start smoking weed. It was always an inside joke that at some point in the night, someone would suggest going there. Last week we finally decided to do it. We had a long weekend and decided to take advantage and visit the famed spot. Both of our parents are pretty strict so we told them we were staying at each other's houses, something we did pretty often, and hit the road.

The drive out was uneventful. We had a little trouble finding the exact spot, google maps is weird when there aren’t many real roads, but besides that we found the trailhead without issue. It’s not a real trailhead, it looks like an animal path more than anything, but landmarks described by past visitors told us we were going the right way.

The first weird thing we noticed was a lack of other people. Mac theorized that it was because it was a Thursday. I was worried it was because Cock Rock wasn’t actually as cool as it was hyped up to be. Even if it wasn’t, I was happy to have the spot to ourselves.

My worries went away when we caught our first glance of the rock. It was, in fact, a giant rock shaped like a dick. Giggling through the last leg of our hike, we made it up to the rock. The “tip” showed the most signs of life, beer cans, cigarette butts, really shitty spray paint, the classic accoutrement you see at a high school hangout where nobody’s forced to clean up.

Mac and I did our civic duty and added to the trash, pulling the beers and ciders we stole from our parents fridge out of our backpacks. They were all about room temperature at that point but hey, alcohol is alcohol to a teenager. 

We hung out for a bit, drinking, smoking, and cracking jokes. We theorized about how the rock got its shape, with my favorite take of the night being Mac’s idea that Paul Bunion got leprosy. After the first few beers were added to the ground, we shulked our jackets to reveal the white shirts we coordinated earlier. We took turns shooting videos of each other jumping out of Dick Slit cave, squirming in the air like tadpoles and doing our best over the top hentai impressions. It was fucking hilarious at the time. 

Once we were satisfied with our collection of videos Mac had the idea of exploring deeper into the cave. Let me be clear, yes we were both decently drunk and very high, but I know what I saw. This was real. I’ve seen shit on drugs before and I can tell the fucking difference. If the substances were responsible for anything, it’d be the dumb fuck decision to go into the cave.

I was nervous about it. I grew up hearing stories about tourists or drunk teens wandering off into caves only to have their bodies drug out days later. I could hear my Dad bitching about “wasting taxes on recovering idiots” in my head, and I really didn’t want to be one of the idiots in question. Mac grew up hearing those stories too, but he was always one of those guys who thinks it’ll never happen to him. We went back and forth for a while. It was pretty late at this point and I was thinking of heading back anyway, while Mac wanted to cap off the night with some spelunking. 

Eventually he said “Fine dude, stay out here if you want but I’m going in”. 

Some variation of that line always gets me. I wish I had more of a spine. Even if I still lost Mac, if I had stayed out of the cave I wouldn’t have seen that evil. That sounds nice now but I know I would never have let him wander in alone.

We went in. Admittedly, it’s a cool cave. The lava rock gives the walls a weird texture, a kind of rough and pocked wavy shape, and the cave itself kept its shape for the most part. About 8 feet tall and 3 feet wide, just enough for us to comfortably squeeze past each other. It was only a few steps in before we left the moonlight behind and had to use our phone flashlights. It was probably a good thing we had no reception because both of our batteries were relatively full. My half-rule was to turn back as soon as we couldn’t see the cave entrance anymore, but Mac insisted that since it was so dark out it didn’t count when we lost sight of the entrance a few yards in.

Not too far after that we hit what I thought was the end of the cave. It made sense that the inside of Cock Rock was never really of note if it’s only a gentle slope that ends after 20 yards or so. I was glad for the excuse to turn back, about as much as Mac was disappointed. I had already taken the first few steps back to fresh air when Mac’s voice rang out behind me.

“Dude! There’s more!”

I turned around to see Mac laying on his stomach, his phone disappearing into a hole in the back of the cave wall. Someone had tried to block it with a large rock which Mac was in the process of pushing away. When the hole was clear it was, to my frustration, slightly bigger than Mac or me, and before I could protest again Mac was shimming his way in. I didn’t like the look of it. The holes' edges  were smoother than you’d expect, and covered in ridges like it was made of fabric instead of stone. Another clear sign to me that we were in over our heads.

“I don’t want to have to pull you out if you get stuck.” I said

Mac just kept disappearing into the squeeze.

“No way man, there’s plenty of room, and I feel air! If it blows it goes!”

Mac took a break from crawling to laugh at the old cavers idiom. There’s enough spelunkers in our town that everyone knows it, even the people like me who make a habit of staying out of caves. The line “if it blows it goes” means that if you feel airflow on the other side of an opening, it’s probably safe to explore. At that moment I cursed whoever came up with the saying for stacking yet another dick joke on a night that was making me seriously uncomfortable.

Mac went through, and shouted encouragement from the other side, promising me that the cave opened up again after ten feet or so.

I knew we shouldn’t have gone farther, but Mac just kept driving us forward. I don’t know if he was distracted by his excitement or was just ignoring my pleas for him to at least slow down. I think he was equally as amazed as I was scared.

I crawled in. As much as I didn’t want to, I couldn’t leave Mac by himself. I almost wanted to let his dumbass-ary catch up with him, but if he slipped or got stuck on his own it could easily mean death, and I wasn’t willing to let that happen.

As I army crawled through the squeeze I realized Mac was right, there was airflow. Weirdly enough it felt warm, and almost humid. I would expect that any air in the cave would be kept cool. Waves of the warm air seemed to push on my face with every forward jolt of my awkward movement. Sure enough, after 10 feet or so I was through, and as I scrambled to my feet I saw an excited Mac already making more progress. I caught up to him and we kept walking deeper.

The cave was almost the same on the other side of the squeeze. The walls and floor maybe looked a little sharper, like this portion had not been touched by the weather of the entrance.

I kept expecting the cave to truly end. A cave in, a pinch point, a drop off, something that would stop us, but it didn’t. I started to really freak out around 150 yards in. I’m guessing of course, fear tends to exaggerate. Not only did the cave not close off, it actually grew. The gentle downward slope of the floor seemed to go on its own, leaving the ceiling to grow farther and farther away. I don’t know how high it went but the phone flashlights couldn’t see it. It grew in width too, but not nearly as much. I could just barely scrape both sides with my outstretched fingertips at its widest point. This thrilled Mac, who was acting like we’d just discovered an Aztec temple. Lines like “How did we not know about this?” and “we should come here all the time!” filled the dank air. 

It was dank that far down. In the real sense of the word. It was a sticky kind of humid that got worse the farther down we went. Along with the wet air came more heat. Not too much, but definitely noticeable. I had had enough. I was sweating, paranoid, terrified and pissed at Mac for ignoring me. I figured I’d give him a taste of his own medicine. 

“Mac! If you wanna fucking crack your head on a rock and die down here that’s fine, but I’m turning around.”

As I said it I stopped moving, standing defiantly as Mac continued on. After a second he stopped too, but not for me. He was glued to the spot, his flashlight and eyes aimed at his feet. 

“Mac? You hear me? You alright?”

Mac didn’t move and talked with a quiet kind of awe and confusion, a far cry from the hyper dumbass he was moments ago.

“Dude… it’s squishy”

I looked at him in confusion 

“What?”

“The ground man! It’s like, bouncy!”

Mac took a step forward and he seemed to slump a little, his feet sinking ever so slightly into the floor of the cave.

“This is crazy man! What is this shit, algae?” Mac said, taking more timid steps. “Doesn’t look like any kind of fungus I’ve seen before, does shit like that grow this far down?”

I took a few careful steps toward him, pointing my phone’s flashlight at the ground. He was right, as I walked the rock turned more transparent and lighter, like a scab transitioning to skin. I stopped on the precipice of the new cave, just before it transitioned all the way to the squishy matter. I could see it clearly now. A weird pitted wet material made up the floor and walls of the cave. It was a sickly mix of purples and pinks, and looked spongy, like tonsil flesh. Bumps of the stuff littered the floor and walls, like rocks and boulders melting into their surroundings. Mac’s feet pressed into the ground, flattening the bridges and ridges into the craters they surrounded, making soft squelches with every step. I was fucking done. 

“MAC! CAN WE FUCKING LEAVE!”

But Mac wouldn’t hear any of it. He was transfixed on his new discovery, filming the walls and his feet as they squished into the floor.

“You think this cave is alive? I mean this shit it-it goes deep.” He pushed a finger into the wall to prove his point. “Yeah no fucking way this is algae man, we just discovered something BIG dude! We’re the explorers of the fucking century!”

It was too much, I felt like a baby as tears started to wash the wet air out of my eyes. 

“Mac, please! We don’t know what this is! We can come back! Please let’s just go! I swear to God I will leave you down here!”

Mac wouldn’t listen. I think I hate him for that. His best friend was begging him and he just didn’t care.

“Oh dude… dude! COCK Rock!”

Mac started laughing like he just told the funniest joke of all time.

“It’s a dick right? We’re in a giant fucking dick!”

Mac leaned on his knees, doubled over at his discovery.

“I mean probably not really, but holy shit what are the odds that COCK ROCK is alive! That’s fucking beautiful man!”

I was standing in defeat at this point, waiting for Mac to come to his senses. Mumbling quiet requests to leave.

“Mac… please…”

Mac did another circle with his flashlight, and noticed a particularly large lump in the spongy floor. It was a circular bump about 2 feet in diameter that protruded a foot out of the ground. 

“Check it out man! I found the prostate!”

Mac cackled as he jumped, extending his legs into the lump as he landed. The thing easily collapsed under his weight.

The fleshy walls of the cave SLAMMED together around Mac. A deep squelch echoed through the cave as the walls met, along with the sickening crunch of Mac’s bones. Hot air blasted me a couple steps backward, and the dank stink of the damned place forced itself up my nose. When I looked back the cave walls were retreating. As they peeled apart, Mac’s clothing and the chunky clumps inside them fell to the ground. Mac drained into the craters and pocks on the floor, and the flesh on the walls where he was crushed eagerly drank away the frothy smears that were left. As Mac soaked into the walls and floor, the cave shuttered. 

I felt an awful sense of relief. The kind of sick pride you feel when someone who drives recklessly finally gets in a crash. I hated feeling that way, I felt like a bad friend. A better friend would have pulled Mac out kicking and screaming, or been in the fleshy weeds with him. If Mac had been a better friend he would have listened. He would have seen my horror and made it his own. I begged him to leave, to think for a second. How can I not say “I told you so” if that’s exactly what I did? Not that Mac could hear it now. I watched blood soak into the white shirt Mac had been wearing, dozens of growing spots like bacteria devouring a Petri dish. The blood devoured our joke until it was full. And I ran.

I tripped and stumbled all the way back to the entrance, shredding my knees on the cave floor and my elbows on the narrowing walls. I practically dove into the squeeze, smacking my chin as I army crawled back through. In my panic it felt tighter than my first time through, like I had to drag myself more than crawl, which added to my now extensive collection of scrapes and bruises. I let out a stifled gasp of relief when I saw the first of the beer cans that marked the entrance. I realized it was the first sound I’d made since I started the ascent. When I flew through the cave entrance I turned back to it and screamed, as if it would hear me and apologize. I spat profanity after profanity. They were for Mac as much as they were for the cave itself.

After my tirade was over the exhaustion of the night caught up with me. I trudged back to the car and drove 10 mph under the limit all the way to the police station. I told them what I saw, every detail. They only believed that Mac and I went out to the rock and Mac never came back. I got nods of pity when I told them about what happened to him, a polite sense that I was just obviously crazy or had a traumatic trip. I don’t blame them, I’d think the same thing. They launched a small search party for Mac over the next few days that turned up nothing. Then they gave up. I asked if they went all the way in, past the squeeze. They told me that there was no squeeze, that the cave ended 20 yards in, that Mac must have wandered off after I left. Those fuckers actually accused me of leaving him behind. They told me they’d keep an eye out and they’d leave Mac’s case open. That’s all Mac is now, a pending case and a tally on the rock’s list.

I'm writing this for anyone passing through southern Utah who hears of a cave to visit with a funny name, or for any of the kids in school who grew up with the legend. I'm begging you, whatever you do and wherever you go, don’t go to Cock Rock.
