There had always been a crack in the floor of my tiny NYC basement apartment. A massive, sprawling crack that covered the ground like a giant spider web. It was so cracked, in fact, that I often wondered what was even keeping my place from collapsing into whatever lay beneath it.  


  
Was it imperfect? Yes. Was it distracting? Yes. Was it an eyesore? Yes.  


  
But in New York City, when you find a studio apartment that possesses that rare combination of affordable and conveniently located to the subway, sometimes imperfect's just gotta do.  


  
So I lived with it. For two years to be precise. I guess I could have called the landlord, and demanded that he fix it. But I fancy myself... something of a procrastinator. And to be honest, other than a handful of times when a friend would visit and ask what was wrong with my floor, I almost forgot that the crack even existed.  


  
That is, until this morning. When, at around 10:23 am Eastern Time, a magnitude 4.8 earthquake hit NYC, shaking my apartment building, and causing that very crack on my floor, to crumble into pieces and cave away, unearthing of all things... a crevasse that appeared to lead deep into the earth.  


  
Now, anyone in their right mind would have immediately called their landlord, or emergency services, or both. But like I said. I'm a procrastinator. So, somewhere between when the quake hit and my slew of remote work calls began, I kind of just... blocked it out, and went about my day, business as usual.  


  
I blocked it out so much so, that at one point, upon discovering that I had an hour and a half break between my calls, I even took a nap.  


  
But the thing about taking a nap when you've got a chasm into an unknown abyss in your apartment is... strange things can happen while you're sleeping.  


  
Things like... hearing whispers coming from inside the fissure, calling for you to venture down into it.  


  
"What the?" I gasped, as I awoke from my midday slumber, to hear the news of the earthquake still playing faintly on my TV. But that wasn't the sound that I had heard in my dreams.  


  
*Must have been a nightmare.* I thought to myself, before walking into the bathroom and turning on my electric toothbrush, to freshen up my post-nap breath.  


  
BUZZ.  


  
But as it buzzed away, just as it always did, for what was two perfectly timed minutes but felt like an eternity, I could have sworn I heard a voice coming from the other room.  


  
CLICK. As the toothbrush went silent.  


  
*Nothing.*  


  
CLICK.  


  
BUZZ. As the toothbrush started buzzing again.  


  
*Wait. There it is again.*  


  
CLICK.  


  
But this time, when the toothbrush went silent, I caught the tail end of someone whispering in the other room.  


  
"Climb down. Climb down." The voice called out ominously.  


  
I put down my toothbrush, leaned back, and looked into the studio, at the hole in the center of my floor, half-expecting to see someone crawling out of it. But I saw... nothing.  


  
"I'm losing it." I said out loud, before throwing on a pair of headphones, and rushing back to another conference call.  


  
Sure enough, about fifteen minutes into the meeting, as I feigned interest in the subject matter and laughter at my boss' lame jokes, I started to hear the voice again.  


  
CLICK. As I muted the call.  


  
"Climb down. Climb down."  


  
"What the fuck?" I called out, still on mute but visually concerned enough to attract the attention of my boss.  


  
"Hey, Dave? Dave? Everything okay?" He asked.  


  
CLICK. CLICK. As I unmuted the call, and my microphone.  


  
"Uh, yeah. Sorry, someone accidentally buzzed my apartment. The neighbor must have a package."  


  
"Oh, right." He replied, before continuing on with whatever nonsense he was ranting about in the first place.  


  
CLICK. As I muted my microphone, but left his audio playing. I tried my best to listen to what he was saying, and to focus on his words. I really did.  


  
But no matter how hard I tried, I kept getting distracted by the whisper.  


  
"Climb down. Climb down."  


  
"Climb down. Climb down."  


  
Until eventually, I couldn't take it anymore.  


  
CLICK. As I unmuted my microphone.  


  
"Hey, guys. I'm sorry, this delivery man just keeps buzzing. I'll be right back."  


  
CLICK. WHOOSH. As I left the meeting.  


  
"Climb down. Climb down."  


  
I sat there for a moment, staring at the chasm in my floor where the giant crack used to be, and, for reasons I don't quite understand, walked over to it, looked down, and considered climbing in.  


  
But before I could even take a step inside...  


  
BUZZ.  


  
...I was snapped out of whatever had come over me by the sound of my phone buzzing on the kitchen table.  


  
And upon checking it, I saw a text message from Jenny, a girl I'd met on the dating apps and had gone on a few dates with. Three, to be precise.  


  
"Hey I'm outside!"  


  
*Fuck.* I thought to myself, remembering that we had plans to watch a movie after work.  


  
"Be right there." I texted back, as I ran up the stairs and let her in.  


  
"What the fuck is that?" Jenny asked, as she entered my apartment, and carefully passed by the crevasse in the center of the room.  


  
"Oh. That." I said, letting out a sigh. "Uh, you know that earthquake today?"  


  
"Yeah?" She replied.  


  
I simply pointed at the fissure and smiled.  


  
"But it was just a 4.8?" She asked.  


  
"Uh, there was this crack. That I probably should have fixed." I said.  


  
She laughed out loud. "Well I can honestly say this is a first. But you know what? Dating in NYC, not the worst apartment I've seen."  


  
At that moment, I thought about coming clean, and telling her about the whispers that I'd heard coming from the hole in the floor. But before I could bring myself to do so, I had second thoughts.  


  
*What's wrong with you? Clearly there's nothing down there. The fact that there's a giant crevasse in your floor is bad enough. If you tell her that, you're gonna creep her out.*  


  
So I just kept the whispers to myself.  


  
That is, until they started happening again.  


  
"What was that?" Jenny asked, as she paused the movie.  


  
"Wait, what was what?" I replied, playing dumb.  


  
"That noise. It sounded like a voice."  


  
I was both relieved to hear that she'd heard the whisper but at the same time terrified that she had. Because I guess that meant that it must be real after all, and that I would have to explain that I had heard it as well.  


  
So I just turned up the volume on the TV, and hoped the voice would go away.  


  
Sure enough, the movie was playing so loud, in fact, that we couldn't hear anything else. So if it was still happening, we couldn't hear it.  


  
And so, after about an hour of watching the movie, with the volume as loud as possible, I once again forgot about the whispers.  


  
Until suddenly...  


  
DING.  


  
...The doorbell rang.  


  
"Pizza's here!" I said to Jenny.  


  
CLICK. As I paused the movie.  


  
"That was quick!" She replied.  


  
"Be right back." I said, as I hopped up from the couch, ran up the stairs, opened the door, and greeted the delivery person outside.  


  
"Here ya go." He said, pulling the oversized pizza box out of his delivery bag and handing it to me.  


  
"Thanks." I replied, before attempting to balance the pizza box and rummage through my wallet for a tip. But all I had was a twenty. "Got change?"  


  
He then proceeded to rummage through his own wallet, looking for the proper change, before handing a ten and two fives back to me.  


  
"Here, thanks again." I said, handing him the ten, waving goodbye, closing the door, and running back downstairs.  


  
But when I got back down to my apartment, I made a horrifying discovery...  


  
â€¦Jenny, crawling into the crevasse feet first, half her body nearly submerged into the ground.  


  
"Jenny, no!" I screamed, as I dropped the pizza box, ran over, and pulled her out of the chasm.  


  
"Huh? What's going on?" She asked, as if awoken from a dream.  


  
"You were crawling into the crevasse." I said, still catching my breath.  


  
"What?" She replied, confused, and rightfully so.  


  
I spent the better part of the next thirty minutes trying to explain everything to Jenny. The crevasse. The voices. Why I hadn't told her about the voices. How I had nearly crawled inside the crevasse. And how she had almost done the same.  


  
But as one can imagine, it was all a bit too much for a fourth date, causing Jenny to leave in a panic, and likely, never contact me again.  


  
Now I'm left here, sitting by myself, staring at the crevasse with the movie's audio on as loud as possible, as I wonder who's been whispering, if they'll ever stop, and what I should do next.
