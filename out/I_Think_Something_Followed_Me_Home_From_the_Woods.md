I never really believed in the paranormal. I grew up in a pretty normal family, nothing weird ever happened to me, and whenever people told ghost stories, I thought they were exaggerating. That changed last month.

There’s a patch of woods behind my town that everyone says is creepy. I always thought it was just kids trying to scare each other. But one night, I couldn’t sleep, and I decided to take a walk. I don’t know why, but I went straight toward those woods.

At first, it was peaceful. The air was cool, and the crickets were so loud it almost sounded like static. But the deeper I walked in, the quieter it got. No bugs, no owls, no wind. Just silence. It felt like the whole forest was holding its breath.

I don’t know how long I wandered, but at some point, I started feeling like I wasn’t alone. It wasn’t a sound or movement that set me off. It was just this heavy feeling, like something was watching me from between the trees. My chest felt tight, and I suddenly realized I had no clue where the path was anymore.

Then I heard it. Footsteps. Not animals rustling leaves. Actual, slow, deliberate footsteps, matching mine. I froze, and they froze. I took one step, and I swear on my life, I heard one step right behind me.

I turned around so fast I almost tripped, but there was nothing there. Just trees, stretching on forever. I tried to laugh it off, but it came out shaky. I pulled out my phone for the flashlight, but the screen wouldn’t turn on. Completely black, even though I’d charged it before I left. That’s when I really started panicking.

I picked a direction and just ran. Branches cut my arms and face, but I didn’t care. I ran until I finally saw the faint glow of streetlights through the trees. When I got home, I slammed the door and locked every bolt. I felt safe again.

At least, I thought I did.

That night, I kept waking up. Every time I opened my eyes, I swore I saw something in the corner of my room. Not moving. Not making a sound. Just darker than the rest of the shadows. But when I blinked, it would be gone. I convinced myself it was just leftover fear from the woods.

But over the next week, strange things started happening. I would find my bedroom door wide open in the morning, even though I lock it before bed. I’d hear faint tapping on my windows at night, but when I checked, there’d be nothing there. My phone would glitch constantly, going black just like it did in the forest.

Then one night, I woke up because I heard breathing. Not mine. Slow, heavy breathing, right next to my bed. I didn’t dare move. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it would burst. I could feel the air shift, like something was leaning over me. I shut my eyes tight, and eventually, the breathing stopped. When I opened them again, my room was empty.

I tried telling myself it was all in my head. But two nights ago, I saw it.

I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, too scared to sleep. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed the shadow in the corner of my room again. Only this time, it was moving. Slowly, it stretched upward, taller and taller, until it almost touched the ceiling. I could see the outline now, like a person, but its arms were too long, and its head tilted in this unnatural way.

It didn’t move toward me. It just stood there, swaying like it was waiting. I couldn’t take it anymore. I turned on the lamp right beside my bed, and of course, the shadow was gone.

But here’s the part that really terrifies me.

Yesterday morning, I left for school, and when I came back, I found muddy footprints leading from my front door to my bedroom. My carpet is pale gray, and the prints were so clear, like bare feet, bigger than mine. They stopped right beside my bed, facing it.

I don’t know what to do. I’m sitting here writing this, and I keep glancing at the corner of my room. The air feels heavy again, and I swear the shadows look darker than they should.

If anyone’s reading this, please believe me. Don’t go into the woods near my town. Something followed me home, and I don’t think it’s going to leave.
