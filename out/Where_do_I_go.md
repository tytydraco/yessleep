I married my High School sweetheart right after graduation, it didn’t take long before I saw who she really was, she had a lot of childhood trauma that she never talked about once I even caught her trying to down a bottle of pain killers, I was not prepared to deal with this at such a young age, after only a few months we both agreed we weren’t for each other and went separate ways, I moved to Texas to live with my grandparents, start college and start over, I didn’t know anyone here and while I tried to be social I couldn’t find a new girlfriend, I felt lonely and depressed part of me still missed her I guess, in a way I wasn’t ready to move on, I found a job at a call center for a phone company it was boring but it would get me through college.

There I met her, she was bright, energetic and fun, her name is Iris, she started talking to me I was still a bit shy, I began to notice she started taking her lunch hour at the same time I did and would join me for lunch, I was very excited to make friends, she could talk for hours and I began to fall for her, I asked her if we could get dinner sometime and she agreed, I could not contain all the joy I felt, It was at that moment I felt things were going to get better, we started dating shortly after and I couldn’t be happier!

After a couple of weeks she told me she was looking for a new place to live and she found a room with a friend and asked me If I could help her move, so I did, there was a spare room for rent and after talking it over we all agreed it would be great if I could move in as well, also I didn’t want to be a burden on my grandparents for longer than I needed to.

The first night at the new place was great we had pizza and watched a movie I really felt like I finally had new friends, also things between me and Iris couldn’t be better its perfect!

After a few nights things started to change I suddenly didn’t feel alone in my room, I’ve always been a skeptic when it comes to ghosts and spirits so I just brushed it off and went to sleep, sometime during the night Iris woke me up and asked to sleep in my bed, I of course agreed, she hugged me tight and we both fell asleep.

Until we both suddenly were woken up by a strange feeling, we were not alone in the darkness, I could feel the hairs on my back raise and a cold feeling running down my back, I kept it to myself worried Iris was going to think I was a coward, I could feel this thing walk around my bed over to her side that’s when she whispered in my ear “I was hoping it was going to stay on your side” thus confirming I wasn’t imagining things, I held her tight and stayed completely still until we both fell back asleep.

Still a bit shaken from that experience we decided last night to make it a movie night and sleep in the living room, we brought pillows and blankets and soon we forgot all about it, during the night Iris woke me up she was terrified once again we were not alone, this time she told me she had a dream, she saw a mirror on the wall of the living room and on that mirror she saw a gray old woman and she looked angry, I once again hugged her and told her everything would be ok but I didn’t sleep that night this was starting to worry me.

This morning we decided to talk to Katherine our other roommate and the owner of the house about what was happening, she didn’t seem concerned she was even laughing at us, until Iris described the old woman in the mirror and Katherine went quiet, her eyes teared up and her voice started to break, this house belonged to my grandmother, she said, me still being a skeptic said “Yeah but it’s not like she died here right?” Katherine’s face went expressionless, “We found her in her room” (Now my room) I felt angry and a little sick, Katherine and Iris remained quiet and I was speechless.

Iris told me we needed to talk but not in the home, she asked me to drive to a park, she seemed nervous, I wondered if this was too much for her to handle, we sat down on a bench and she was at the brink of tears she couldn’t even look at me, I don’t want to be alone she said, I was a bit confused but I assured her I wasn’t going anywhere, that’s when I received a notification on my phone, It’s Iris she’s asking where I’m at, I excused myself saying I have to answer a call, who is here with me and who is at home?
