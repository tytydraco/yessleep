I like to look back and reminisce about old days with my ma. I do a lot of international travel for work, so curling up on the couch next to my mother and paging through old photos has become our yearly way of mother-daughter bonding over the holidays. Memories are so much more vivid when you’re holding physical pictures; old smells breathed in again, forgotten locales recalled, names and faces springing back into memory from some dusty and long neglected corner of your mind. 

I’m very little in most of the photos, happy and carefree in ways I might never be again. I love it, but it also makes me a bit sad.

Yesterday, I got a message from someone I hadn’t heard from in years. “Hey, Kris, is that you in the back?” Smiley face. He attached a photo of us at one of his birthday parties. We looked to be around five years old (perhaps six for me as I have a year on him). We were outside at some small event venue and he was sitting on the driver seat of a toy car, chubby hands proudly gripping the plastic steering wheel as I stood shielding my eyes from a sunny glare a few feet away. Parents and kids were frozen behind us in different stages of movement and party-going. Laughs and smiles all ‘round. It was a cute little time capsule, perfectly captured. 

“Oh my God, yeah, I think that’s me,” I typed back. “Thanks so much for sharing it! Mom and I love looking at old pictures.”

He typed a two-word response: “Me too.” An ellipsis flashed next to his name for a good minute or so like more was coming, but nothing did. I thought about keeping up the chat, but I didn’t want to bother him, so I just saved the picture and made a mental note to share it with ma when I next saw her. I did exactly that the night before Thanksgiving. I wish I hadn’t, but this is where I’m at now.

At some point in my young life, I guess loved him. We were never serious—we were too young for that—but he was a lot of things to me. He was someone I grew up with, a childhood friend and a man I could trust, and a sweet, guiltless first kiss at sixteen. Then he grew into a certain severity as a teenager, keeping me at arm’s length until our relationship fizzled.  He moved to another state and I moved on with my life. 

I hadn’t thought of Jay much at all recently with all the worlds and time and countries between us. But now, here he was, in my head, coalescing into an idealized totem of better days. Life can get lonely when you travel for your livelihood. After the euphoria of sightseeing and discovery wears off, you tend to want for the old and familiar… with the bad things taken out, of course.

I realize now that I’m stalling. I thought writing this out would help me make sense of things, but all I’m getting so far is more pain. 

Okay. No more. No more stalling. Just write it all out.

I arrived late the night before Thanksgiving, but ma welcomed me in with all the warmth in the world, like time wasn’t a factor. We hugged, we had dinner, we sat down, and we took out the albums to look at the pictures. “Jay sent me this one too,” I said. “I thought you might like it. Look how cute we were!”

I expected something approximating a charmed response, but that’s not what I got from my mother. Instead she stiffened, and her smile died a slow death on her face. Did she get pale, too, or was that simply what such a sudden change in mood felt like? I wasn’t sure. I’m still not.

“Get rid of it.” Her words weren’t a whisper, but they were low enough that I strained to hear them, coated with a fear I seldom saw in ma. “You should get rid of it,” she said, a bit louder this time, reasserting some confidence. 

I took the picture back and laughed, not sure what to make of the reaction. “Get rid of it? Why? What’s wrong with it? It’s just a picture.” 

I was already thinking of a thousand ways I may have erred. Ma took a gentle hold of my hand, and she looked at me the way she had only once before, on that awful day my father and sister had their accident. It was the same severe face, with the same guarded pain. It didn’t fit my sweet old ma at all. I wanted badly to unsee it.

Ma asked if Jay had sent the photo to me. When I nodded, ma closed her eyes and tried to still her breathing, a soothing mechanism she learned in therapy and later taught me. “He shouldn’t have sent it to you.”

I looked at the photo again, struggling to find anything odd or frightening about it. Again I saw Jay, the toy car, myself, the kids behind us, their parents. Everything was normal. Then I saw it. To be more specific, I saw him. I don’t know how I didn’t notice him before. Maybe he didn’t want me to see him. Or maybe I wasn’t ready.

The parents in the photo all looked to be in their thirties, or forties at most. They had all looked like huge old giants to me as a child, but they were probably younger then than I am now. This man was old, gaunt, and taller by a head or two than the adults around him, not at all like the other parents. He had a straight, long-limbed stance that stood apart from the merriment around him. His clothes were off, too; he was wearing an old brown suit, double-breasted and much too small for him, and faded khakis that failed to reach his ankles, exposing bony calves and mismatched long socks. Wisps of uncombed white hair hung loosely at the sides of his head, then top of which was bald and dotted with age. I couldn’t see his eyes, sunken into the shadows of his angular face. But I could see his mouth, thin dry lips stretched taut into a half-smiling grimace. I couldn’t read the emotion in that face—I’m not sure anyone could have—but it felt wrong. What stood out most to me about him, though, was how muted he felt, as if he could drain the life and color from his immediate vicinity. Everything around him was joy and pastels, but he just… wasn’t.

“Ma? This man…” I struggled to formulate the question somehow, even though it was so simple. “I don’t recognize him. Who…?”

Ma got up and disappeared into the kitchen. I could hear her shuffling around, clanging mugs together. Then came the whistle of boiling water. She was making tea. When she returned, she put a chamomile mug in my hands and sat across from me in her smaller sofa, blowing gently at the drink in her hands. 

“I can’t say I ever met that man. I can’t say I ever even saw him, really. But Jay did. Jay saw him.” Ma took a sip of her tea. I was too unnerved to drink mine.

I asked her, “What do you mean you never saw him, ma? If you never saw him, you can’t know who he is, right?”

Ma smiled a faint smile. It barely reached her eyes. “You know how Jay could paint a picture with words.” I did; Jay was a talented writer from a young age. Ma continued. “This would have been when you and Jay were about ten, five years or so before that picture would have been taken. And about a year before your—“

“Right,” I interjected. I didn’t want to talk about pa and sis. Not now. Not ever, really. It was an old wound, old and very much buried.

“Jay described this man to his Emma and me once around that time,” Ma said, sighing. “He said a tall old man would appear to him, day or night, at odd hours and random days, but usually when he was alone. Emma didn’t believe him. I can’t say I believed him either. Not at first.”

Emma was Jay’s mother, and practically a second mother to me. She was a sweet woman, but very spiritual if not outright superstitious. It seemed strange for her not to believe her own son with something like this. 

Ma seemed to sense my thought. “What he told us didn’t make much sense,” she said. “Jay told us this man would appear to him at his bedside, outside his window, sometimes at school, right outside the classroom or behind his teachers. But nobody ever seemed to notice the old man. And the way he described him, well, you’d think a seven foot guy in silly socks and clothes two sizes too small would stick out to people. But that’s exactly how he described him, down to every last little detail. The man in that photo has to be the same man.”

“Who is he?” I asked. My insides coiled in my stomach, my body bracing itself for some undefined terror that had yet to reveal itself. “We’re not talking about a ghost here, are we, ma?

Ma shook her head, eyes shut. I could see moisture in her long eyelashes. “No, no, not a ghost, maybe not a man either.”

“What, then?”

“An omen.” Ma could do little to stifle the tears at this point. “A warning. I’m just not sure why it chose Jay and not us. Poor, poor boy.”

I wasn’t sure what to way at that point; I simply waited for my mother to continue. When she’d gathered herself, she took my hand. “This man, this thing, came to Jay many times, so he said. But he spoke to him only one time, that same year.”

My throat was tight. A budding anguish was trying to choke me somehow. “What did he say?” I asked.

Ma loomed me straight in the eyes the way she’d only done once before. She picked her words carefully, and somehow, I knew them before she spoke them. “He said the old man smiled an awful, awful smile.  And then he told him, ‘Little Kris’s father will kill someone soon.’”

For a few terrible moments, I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. My mouth went dry and I felt a coldness inside me, a pressure in my gut. I took a sip of tea hoping for warmth, for comfort, but it was ice-cold now, too.

Ma had come undone. “We got so angry at Jay,” she croaked. “Emma pinched him and tried to send him to his room, and he said he’d been seeing that horrible creature for years, but he knew nobody would believe him, so he kept it quiet. But this time, he couldn’t keep it quiet—“

“—because he knew what it would do to us,” I said, completing the statement.

Ma shook her head. “To you, baby. He was afraid what it would do to you.”

When I was ten, pa had a heart attack while driving my sister to soccer practice. When the pain started, he lost control of his car and crashed onto oncoming traffic. Six people were injured, but only two of them died. Pa died on impact and sis passed on the way to the hospital. It nearly killed me; I have the scar to prove it. I’m sure it nearly killed ma, too. And Jay—brave, tiny, ten-year-old Jay—had tried to warn us, knowing we’d likely think he was crazy. 

I was scared, terrified of the existential dread and implications of what I had just heard. But more than that, I was angry. Whatever that man, whatever that creature was, it wasn’t trying to warn us the way Jay had tried to. It wanted to watch the fireworks, to feed on our loss. Somehow I was absolutely sure of that. Had he watched it happen? Was he watching us fall apart this very moment, licking his thin dry lips? And if he was, and Jay were here, would he ask if we can see him?

After the quietest Thanksgiving meal of our lives, I went on social media hoping to reconnect with Jay, but he’d deleted his account. I tried calling him, too, but he’d changed his phone number. Why did he send me that photo? I pray now that he can hear my thoughts, and hope to see him again someday soon: “I believe you, Jay, and I love you, and I know you did your best. Nothing was your fault. Love, Kris.”
