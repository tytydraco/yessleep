Let me begin by telling you how sacrifices work. I understand that this post might not be taken seriously given the fact I am a random person posting this on the Internet, but even if it's interpreted as just another horror story, I need to get this out of my head. And to be honest, it's probably best that you don't take this so seriously.

The following is my best summary of a chapter of a book I did not write, but have found to be true, given evidence I have observed in my own life. 

"How Sacrifices Work" 

There is a presence in the room with you. If you are indoors, it is indoors with you. If you are outside, it is outside somewhere near you. If you're on a couch, it may be sitting on the other side. If you are in the driver's seat of your car, eating a sandwich on your lunch break, one of the surrounding seats may be occupied. If you are in bed, it is lying beside you. 

Now that you understand this, you better not pretend it isn't there. Do not run from the relationship you have just began. Do not pretend to be alone. It craves acknowledgement. 

This is the basic foundation of sacrifice. Sacrifice is acknowledgement, and acknowledgement is sacrifice. 

The greater your belief, the greater your sacrifice. The greater your sacrifice, the greater your reward. 

To sacrifice is to present evidence of your belief. And to believe in the presence is to sacrifice your comfort, and to sacrifice your comfort is to grow your mind.

But the inverse is also true. Don't close your eyes, and don't try distracting yourself. If you put something on the T.V. just know that it is watching you at the same time. Know that it will grow impatient, and that it feels resentment.

-And that's about all that I read before I closed the book. 

I found it in my eight year old son's nightstand last week. I thought it was a horror novel at first. You know how the first few pages are usually nothing but credits and publisher information? The first page was pretty much what you just read. There wasn't even a clear author. I'll do my best to write out the conversation I had with my son.

"Honey, what's this?" I asked, holding the book. 

He looked surprised. 

"My language arts teacher, Mr. Richards gave it to me. Did you... Did you read it?" He asked.

"I skimmed the first page. Why did he give this to you?" 

"I don't know. He said it was a required read." 

Obviously, given the contents of the book, I was furious. But as it turns out, the book didn't belong to my son's teacher. In fact, he didn't even have a language arts class, he was in elementary school and had only one class with one teacher: Mrs. Dawson. 

When I asked my son about this, he insisted he was telling the truth. But I thought he probably just got it from another kid and knew he shouldn't be reading it, so he must have lied and said it was a school assignment. I threw the book away and forgot about it. 

The words stuck with me. I felt paranoid when I was alone at night. I avoided looking in the mirror when I was in the bathroom. I took shorter showers. 

Eventually, I was able to force myself to feel comfortable again. It was just a silly horror novel or something, I thought. I settled back into my regular routine. 

A couple weeks later, I woke up to a grotesque smell. Something earthly and caramelized, and then burnt. I put my glasses on and got out of bed. 

Jimmy was burning worms in the kitchen. I didn't even know what they were when I first saw them smoking in the pan. They were obviously dead by the time they were burnt. I was so confused I didn't say anything. I shut off the stove, and looked closely at what was in the pan. 

"Mom," he said, with a shaky voice. "It said to-"

"Are these worms?" I asked. 

"Yeah." I noticed tears streaming down his face.

"Why did you do this?" I asked.

"It said - well, i'm worried about my test tomorrow."

"What?" 

And then it clicked. I realized what he meant. 

"Did you get these from outside?" I asked.

"Uh huh." 

"Tell me exactly what you think you were doing."

"Sacrificing," he said, 

I disposed of the worms and told him the book was just fiction. It wasn't real, and these were innocent worms. I went to sleep after that and talked with him more in the morning.

It seemed like he understood. I really thought he did. I stressed to him how serious it was that he did this, and that if he thought about doing this kind of thing again he should talk about it with me. I told myself that if I saw any more unusual behavior, I would talk to a psychiatrist. But things seemed fine from then on. In fact, they seemed better. 

My son excelled in school. Or so his teacher told me. He seemed to be making more friends, and he had lots of sleepovers. Within a few months, I moved on. It was just a screwed up book that messed with my son's head, I thought. No big deal. 

I, on the other hand, hadn't been doing well. I was losing friends, they just didn't want to talk with me anymore. I made so many mistakes at work, things I normally wouldn't do. That was the beginning.

That paranoid feeling came back. I had so many nightmares. I dreamed of the words I had read so many months ago. I was always thinking about the presence. There was a man in my dreams, always out of sight, but he was there. 

Then he crept into the day. At first, it seemed to be more like hypnagogic hallucinations. Occasionally when I got up to use the bathroom at night, I would think I saw him in the mirror. 

I saw him in public here and there. He pretended to be just another person, buying groceries. Or getting gas. But I know he was watching me, trying to creep into my head. He wasn't very good at pretending to be human. I could never seem to get him in direct sight, but I know from my peripheral vision that he didn't wear clothes like we do.

The more I tried to ignore him, the worse things became. But I wasn't giving in. I talked to my doctor about my hallucinations and began the process of psychiatric evaluation. 

At least I could still take comfort in my perfect son. Jimmy was happy. He was healthy.

But then I found the animals in the backyard. Buried loosely behind the bushes. Some were fresh, others were horribly decomposed. All of them were mangled up, and torn to shreds. I don't know what they were. There were bits of fur, feathers, and even what looked like chicken feet. It didn't take long for me to understand. 

I contacted a child psychiatrist the next day, and scheduled an appointment.

When I confronted my son about the animals, he acted bewildered. 

"Mom, I didn't kill any animals!"

"Sweetie, I'm not mad. You don't have to lie to me. Can we just talk about it?" I asked. 

"I don't even know what you want me to talk about. It wasn't me." He started to cry.

I just stared at him silently. 

He broke down completely. It had been a long time since I saw him cry like that. When he settled down, he started to explain. 

"I'm sorry. I didn't want to. I really didn't," he said.

"Why did you?" 

"Because... I... I had to. He doesn't bother me if I do it," he admitted. "And... everything gets easier." 

"Honey, listen to me. We're gonna go talk to someone about this next Tuesday. Okay? You don't have to be like this. It's going to be okay. And I love you. Do you understand? I love you, and I'm gonna take care of you." 


Later that night, I woke up to a feeling of immense pressure in my gut. When I opened my eyes, he was looking right at me.

Jimmy stabbed me in my sleep with a kitchen knife. 

His hands gripped the knife tightly, and he looked scared, but there were no tears in his eyes. 

"Jimmy," I groaned. 

He stayed completely still, and then he suddenly pulled the knife out in a swift motion. But just when I started to scream out in agony, he plunged it right back into me. 

Adrenaline-filled and furious, I kicked him away from me, and he fell to the ground beside my bed. I quickly dialed 911, and watched him carefully, like he was a dog. A dog that I trusted, and loved, dearly. A dog that snapped. 

Jimmy rushed out of my room. 

"Jimmy?" I yelled. 

A few seconds later I heard the unsheathing of a steak knife from the kitchen, and I rushed to my bedroom door, closing it, and locking the handle, all with a blade plunged deep inside of me.

The police arrived to an awkward scene. The front door was locked, but I let them in through my bedroom window. 

"Ma'am, who else is in the house with you?" 

"It's my son. My eight year old."

"Is there anyone else? Did he stab you?" 

"He stabbed me. There's no one else here."

Jimmy was on the ground crying when they found him. Soon after, I was rushed to the hospital. 

Long story short, I had to explain numerous times to police, doctors, and psychologists what happened. I told them about the worms, and the animals.

Jimmy's mental condition has not improved since his attempt on my life. For the last year, he has been living in a children's psychiatric hospital. I visit him every day, and he pretends to be okay, but I know he's not. They watch him 24/7. He breaks down constantly. He throws fits of rage, and then sobs. He looks terrible. And I know why. 

I was hoping that I wouldn't have to tell anyone about this. I told myself I would never open anyone else up to the truth of the presences that surround them. I first hoped that the fasting would work. And then it was the fishing trips. But they weren't enough to bring my son's mind back. I hoped all of those trips to the pet store might finally pay off, but they never have the effect I desire. I want my son back. For that, I think I need to make a different kind of sacrifice. 

I didn't want to tell anyone the truth about how sacrifices work, but there was no other option. I'm sorry.
