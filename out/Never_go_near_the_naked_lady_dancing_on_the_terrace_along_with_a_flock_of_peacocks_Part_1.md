'Creaaakkk', I hear someone going upstairs. I look at the clock. It's 2:45 a.m. "Who the fuck is up this night?" I say to myself before getting out of bed. As I open the door, I see a shadow near the terrace door. I go behind the shadow, causing no sound.


I could see someone shutting the entrance door. As I reached the door, I could hear some heavy breathing. Putting my hand on the knob, I hear a hop, just like someone skipping rope. I was lurking behind the door.


The moment I took a peek through the keyhole, I was dumbstruck.


A lady, dancing with no clothes on, swarmed with a few Peacocks flaring their feathers, dancing along with her, shielding the lady's face.


The more I wait, the more peacocks join in. After giving it some thought, I kicked the door open to confront the lady. To my surprise, the lady, still dancing, sprinted towards the corner of the terrace and leaped down, along with the peacocks.


The house was a duplex, so jumping would be lethal. I immediately go to the corner and look down, and all I see is the lady, with no injuries, running towards the woods.


Without pondering, I tried going downstairs, but a peacock acted as an obstacle. Standing in front of the door, the peacock was in no mood to give me way. I tried to trash it away, but then the flushed eyeballs, spread feathers, and ferocious look hindered my escape.


I took a few steps back and sat near a corner, hoping for a greener pasture, before unknowingly falling asleep.


"Wake up, Michael." I opened my eyes to my Dad's scream. "You slept on the terrace?" Dad asked. I took a gentle glance to see the peacock, but there was nothing. "Probably a fucking nightmare," I say to myself and go downstairs.
 

It was February 12, 1998.
 

We lived in a duplex building, far from the humans and close to the wildlife, with peace stretching over half a kilometre. Parents loved solidarity. Our area was surrounded by some abandoned mines and a church.


We were a family of four. Dad, Jonathan, a 50-year-old scumbag with a widow's peak who was overly hyped by everyone for his work ethic and intelligence, unaware of the luck that covered his pathetic work, owned a whisky company and married Elizabeth after my mom died. Elizabeth, my stepmother, already had a daughter named Grace.


I could sense that he was again heading towards divorce because he was having an affair with a girl my age. I'm 18, Btw.


After getting freshened up, I went downstairs to have my breakfast. I could never eat in my dad's presence because he used to eat a tonne of food like an animal. Before I started to eat, he had already finished eating. My stepmother and sister were there at the table too.


"Did you hear It too?" Mom queried Dad. "The footsteps? Yes, I heard them too," Dad answered. "Maybe there was some burglar trying to get in," Mom said. "You were there on the terrace; did you see someone? You heard something, Michael?" Dad asked. Even though I saw that sh*t last night, I still couldn't believe anything, as it was just like a dream. "No, I did not," I answered.
 

"What happened to your hair? It looks so dry," Mom asked Grace. "Maybe because of the water," she answered. "It's receding too, isn't it?" Mom asked again. She did not even bother to answer because her mind was preoccupied by a book in her hands; hence, nothing could draw her interest.
 

Mom again asked her a couple of times, but Grace felt annoyed and left the breakfast, returning to her room.
 

"She's losing weight too," Mom mumbled.


Grace was an author then. Due to some unknown reasons, She abruptly ended her Linguistic studies seven years ago. I never got an opportunity to have a proper conversation with her, and neither did my dad. Maybe because we weren't born to the same mother. We had our differences.


She previously dated a guy who was bald, fat, middle-aged, unemployed, and an alcoholic who used to live on his mother's earnings, just like my uncle.


She used to stay In her room the entire day and come out only to have a meal. She could only spare time for her mother. She was just 21 but used to look like a 40-year-old Karen.


Life was all good back then, until February 14 hit us.


On the 14th of February, Tuesday night, when I was watching Terminator that day, I had a painful urge to pee. When I got out of my room, I saw our dog, Bob, who could only see with one eye, gazing at the terrace stairs. I was a few steps behind Bob, who was just giving a blank look to the terrace door.
 

Sweating had already begun, and I was keen to know what was on the stairs.
 

When I took a few steps ahead, the dog all of a sudden got scared of something that I couldn't see. "There's no one there; stop it!" I screamed because I was shitting In my pants too!


The entire time, the dog never tilted his head from the staircase, and to make things even worse, the dog started waving his tail, snarling, and running away from the site, acknowledging the unknown.
 

The drama lasted for another 20 minutes, when the dog could no longer hold the fear and sprinted down the stairs.


Scared as hell, I just went inside my room, locked myself up, and didn't dare to pee the entire night.
 

The same night, I once again heard someone dancing upstairs. The sound peacocks make when they get scared or during the mating season is extremely, utterly, awfully disgusting to hear. On that particular night, my eyes were all teary-eyed. It felt like a mysterious aura constricted our home.
 

The next day at the diner, Mom and Dad again talked about the footsteps they heard outside the house. "I heard them too; believe me, someone was dancing right on top of my room; I ain't kidding," I told them. "You better don't get out of your freaking room in the night, buddy," Dad responded sarcastically, as did my Mom.


The following day, when I got up, I could hear someone quarrelling. Going down, I saw Mom crying awfully. She was holding a
t-shirt full of blood stains. Grace was sitting on the couch, reading a book, and penning down some thoughts passionately.
 

"What is it?" I entreat. Wiping off her tears, she cried, saying," I went into her room and found this cloth pierced behind the closet. It has blood on the chest area, and when I checked her chest while she's asleep, I saw a tattoo on her breast, which is bleeding.".
 

The whole time, Grace never tilted her head from the book; she was not even mentally present at the moment. A quarrel erupted inside the house. The heat was unreal. It was even worse than mom and dad's fight. It was a battle between two women, so you know how bad it is.


Right from that day on, Grace never behaved like a human. Being in that pit, I had to literally witness her roaming around the house naked, causing mayhem. As time passed, she completely stopped coming out of her room.
 

One night, when I was going to the fridge, I observed the collapsed dustbin on the floor. "Fuck these cats," I say before witnessing an even more collapsed mental state of grace from the person who was hiding beneath the dining table, eating the stolen shit from the bin. I was quick enough to get out of her sight before making eye-to-eye contact. Even though I wanted to, I refrained from spilling the beans on that issue before my parents.
 

Day by day, the peace in the house started deteriorating, fueling the chaos.


Lesions grew out of her skin, just like thrones. Swollen lymph nodes and twitches were common. The bloody rash did not even spare the face.
 

Except for one occasion, she did not even utter a single word in the language we could understand. Sometimes, I used to see her by the window, staring at the kids playing near the Parish hall, or sometimes in the backyard, reading that book.
 

One Tuesday, dad picked up a call from the divorce attorney. He urged Mom to join him, as it was an important meeting.
 

"Can you take me with you? I don't think being alone is safe here," I request. "Don't you know that Bob is staying with you?" Mom was enraged.


A couple of hours later, mom and dad started off to see the attorney. When I was sending them off, standing at the gate, I hated to turn back to the house. I was all alone in that horror loophole, with danger residing with me. It was 7 in the night.
 

For the first time, the woods felt safer than home. The tiny raindroplets falling on my already teary-eyed eyes made me realise that a storm was about to hit the city.
 

I look up and see clouds crawling across, conquering the sky, battling the moonlight, and giving away a warning to the city to get prepared for the noisy, fierce thunderstorm.
 

I turn back to return, but I see something unsettling. Grace was at the window, staring at me with a smirk. There was no light In her room, just like her smirk.


I could feel the unknown future, which was surely unholy.


As I went in, I made sure to close all the windows and doors, leaving no chance for the intruders. Walking past Grace's room, I thought of telling her to close the window and door, but the little giggles coming from her room defied me.
 

As I locked myself up in my room, the heavy squalls, ripping apart the trees and poles, caused a power outage.
 

"Where's the torch?" I screamed, as I could see nothing. After ages, I finally managed to find myself a torch behind the PC.
 

As I turn it on, I hear someone walking past and breathing heavily outside my room. I could feel the anger behind those Breaths.
 

"Who is it?" I ask in an enraged tone. The answer I got was even more deep breaths.
 

I lost half a litre of sweat as the breathing continued for half an hour.
 

Tears rolled out uncontrollably, as my heart couldn't hold much suspense. I was so dumb to expect a reply in that scenario. The only options I had were to go open the door and confront the unknown or to stay inside, unfazed, aware that either of them could be lethal.
 

After giving it a thorough thought, between fear and courage, I chose courage.
 

As I started walking towards the door, the breathing became weaker and weaker, finally becoming inaudible.
 

I was all sweaty, with tremors manhandling me. With silence clouded, the dog's bark erupted in chaos around the house. I forgot about Bob! He started barking and dropping off items, causing mayhem downstairs. "Maybe there's some burglar inside the house," I thought before grabbing a baseball bat.
 

I thought of taking out my anger on the intruder, wanting to make him disfigured. "Shut up, Bob, I'm coming!" I screamed In joy.
 

As I put my hand on the knob, the barking stopped. "Bob! Bob!" I screamed In fear. At this point, I was all concerned about Bob.
 

"Maybe he backed out," I thought before going down.
 

Going downstairs, I hear knives grinding. I put the torch around and saw that Grace's door was kept open, and the sound was coming from the inside.
 

I turn off the torch and take a peek into the room. With the noisy lightning, I got a flashy view of Grace dancing in front of the mirror, naked, and a peacock by the window. It was the same dance I saw on the terrace a few days before. It all felt like deja-vu.
 

I turned on the torch, and the sudden flash 
reflecting through the mirror disturbed Grace, who then abruptly stopped dancing. I did not even look at her because I was even more shocked to witness Bob, who was lying down, butchered, with his head decapitated.


The knives were still pierced into that guy's stomach. The shaky torch fell onto Grace, who was looking at me through the mirror in front of her. I couldn't distinguish between her eyes and the swollen lymph nodes.
 

Her chest was full of blood. In a moment, I realised that she had pierced another tattoo on her other breast. With lesions, rashes, lumps, and tattoos, her body was literally rotting to hell, and the blood added to her body was utterly sickening.


"What the…?" I scream and throw the torch away before paving all the way out.
 

"Shit happens only when it rains!" I grunt as I sprint.
 

With the rain and heavy squalls, I ran past every abandoned quarter, with no torch, in complete darkness.
 

Amidst the run, I heard something chasing me, and when I looked back, the peacock stared right into my soul.
 

I ran through the meadows, weary all the time, and fear loftily helped me get out of that hell, fetching about half a kilometre.


I finally reached a bus station, where I could see people sleeping on the benches, awaiting their journey. Once I got in there, the scream of Rejoice, after escaping the maze, disrupted the peace of the awaiting passengers, who then kicked me out of the Premises.
 

But I shamelessly grin, emitting happiness, and then cry out loud.
