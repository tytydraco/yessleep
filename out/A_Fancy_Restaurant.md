“Anyways, that’s the seventh nightmare I’ve had about the ghost of Elvis. Pretty scary, huh?” 

Jerry cocked his head back and started making some Elvis “huh ahh” noises. Other guests stared at me as I spit out a mouth full of beer. 

“Easy Gary, these domestic beers cost like seven bucks. Didn’t know I was dining with a celebrity.”

I began coughing and he again replied. “Smoke ya another.” 

Me and Jerry have been best friends and roommates for a long time. We met in elementary school and have been inseparable since. We do our best to go to a restaurant we’ve never been to before every other month. 

“Man this new restaurant looks fancy as Hell. I’m surprised we were able to get in.” 

“Yeah, I slipped a twenty to the hostess.” Jerry winked. “Anyways, I gotta go use the restroom. Be right back.” He scooted back and took off. 

This restaurant sure was fancy. I took in the atmosphere. The room had a warm feel and above gleamed a crystal chandelier. The wait staff seemed so great with guests. There was some unique art on the walls. I felt out of place though. I took a moment to make sure my shirt was tucked in. 

Our waiter came up to me with a smile. “Your food should be out momentarily. Would you care for another cold beer?” 

“I sure would. Thank you.” 

We drove an hour to get here so I’m really hoping the food would be good. We just came across it while driving around. 

I suddenly had a weird feeling and looked at my watch. About that time the waiter came by and out of bowl of stew in front of me.

“Here you are, sir. Some of our famous pot roast.” The waiter smiled very wide.

“I uh….I didn’t order this.”

“It comes with everyone’s entree. It’s complimentary.”

“That’s an odd dish to have before bringing out an entree. Most places would do like a tiny bowl of vegetable or some broth stuff.”

He snickered. “Well sir, we sure are not every other place.”

“Clearly not, this place is fancy.” 

“Go ahead and try it.” I had a weird feeling in my stomach. 

“Why didn’t you bring out a bowl for my friend too?”

“We want to make sure it comes out as fresh as possible. Why are you checking your watch so much?” 

“My friend Jerry went to the bathroom. He’s been gone for about twenty minutes. He’s never in a bathroom for more than twelve.” 

“Hmmm. That’s odd. Go ahead and try your stew.”

“I’m sorry. I’m a vegetarian.” That had to work.

“But you ordered the steak and lobster.” Shit, he remembered. 

My mind was racing and I felt nervous. Something about Jerry being gone so long was scaring me. 

“Well I won’t beg you to eat it. But it’s awfully rude to not eat food prepared for you. Remember that the food comes from somewhere.” He picked up the bowl and walked back towards the kitchen.

Bastard, I didn’t appreciate him trying to make me feel bad. I didn’t remember even seeing anything on the menu quoting they give free stew out. I looked around and seen others eating it though. Some people looked like a bunch of hogs eating slop. It must have been really good. I about went to apologize to the waiter and explain Id try it out. My phone pinged. That was odd, I hardly ever get text messages. It was from Jerry.

“Dude, get out of their now. Start the truck!” 

About that time was when the waiter stood up on a chair.

“Ladies and gentleman , thank you for coming today. I do apologize and understand many of you have seen this before. But our chef is very upset about a guest refusing to eat the food that he so carefully prepared for you all. And because of that, he is ready for the hunt. 

I stood up and looked around. The guests were all looking at me with smiles on their faces. The kitchen door busted open and a man came out in his chef uniform. His eyes were pitch black.

“This is the guy?” He pulled a knife out of his stomach.

“Yes, master.” The waiter nodded. The guests responded. “Yes, master.” He dropped the knife. 

The tension became heavy. It was dead quiet and my heart was pounding loudly as if a drum was gonna force its way out of my chest. 

I turned and sprinted. I heard the chef let out a loud screech that pierced my eardrums. I juked around people and knocked over chairs and tables a long the way I didn’t look back. 

I busted through the door and sprinted through the Parking lot. I looked up and my truck and seen Jerry sitting in the passenger. 

“They took my fucking foot!” 

I turned back and seen the chef standing at the door and his arms began stretching all the way towards us. I cranked the truck and tried taking off. 

The chefs hands were on the truck trying to pull us back towards him. Guests began running out towards us too. 

“We’re gonna die, Gary. Don’t let me go like this.” 

I slammed on the gas as hard as I can and began shaking the wheel around. Jerry’s window busted open and the hand was reaching towards him. I grabbed my pocket knife out of the cup holder and jammed it as hard as I could into the hand. 

The chefs arms drew back and he let out a loud screech. I ran over a few of the guests that were sprinting towards us. 

“What the hell happened in there!” I shouted loudly. 

“I went to the bathroom and was minding my own. Some of the staff came in and jerked the guy out of the stall next to me. I put my feet up on the toilet and hoped they didn’t think I was there, but they did. The ripped out the door and got me too.

The chef severed the poor guy up part by part. I think he was here alone. All the guests eat here pretty regularly. They got my foot.  I grabbed a knife near by and jabbed that son of a bitch. I was able to hobble out and hide in a dumpster. He does something to the food or something. I don’t know. But I do know I need a doctor.”

We got to the ER and nurses and doctors worked on Jerry. I tried explaining to the officer that came by what happened and where the restaurant location was. He told me that there was no restaurant in that empty lot. He knew the place. He also said he’d Call backup to check.

But the reason I’m writing this is because I am scared. I heard him make a phone call when I went out to have a smoke. He said 

“They are at the hospital. I will take care of it, master.”
