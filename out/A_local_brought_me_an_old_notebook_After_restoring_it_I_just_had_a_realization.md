 *The following text was found inside a small notebook on the outskirts of Passchendaele, a village near the city of Ypres, Belgium. I managed to restore the contents of it.*

*One kind local brought it to my antique shop and said that she found it several inches underground while she was doing her gardening. After inspecting the area, I also found a Brodie helmet, possibly belonging to a British soldier. This suggests that the notebook was likely in use during the First World War.* 

*Because of how old it is however, I could only restore the remaining contents of the notebook. The front covering may have had something written on it, although there is no possible way for me finding it out. But if I could take a guess, it would be the soldiers name.*

*I also have to note that the first few pages have been ripped from the notebook, therefore I will have no way of knowing what is written on those front pages.*

25th December, 1914

Well, the war didn't end. I mean, I should have expected it, considering the amount of retreats the BEF were having. The Germans were much stronger than we thought. Turns out dead bodies were much more common in the front lines. I can almost get used to it, but they just look so horrific. These trenches emit the stench of death.

Some of them look at you with horrific and dead eyes, it sends shivers down my spine. Some of them don't even have faces, some of them are missing limbs. The scattered pieces on the floor, The rotting corpses being eaten by rats, some upside down, some halfway buried, some stained with mud and blood. The sight of it is traumatizing. Oh, I could hear the screams of another one, I wonder what happened to him.

5:02pm

I also have to note that because of our slowly increasing workload, my time spent writing is getting shorter and shorter. It might even be months at a time. Not the easiest work either. Moving sandbags, cleaning the dugouts, fixing duckboards, burying bodies. We've even made a dugout just for throwing in bodies, but even that is starting to get filled up. The stench is also horrible. I'm getting orders from Lieutenant Milby again. So long for now.

\----

2nd February, 1915

Oh finally, some free time. I have a lot to talk about this time, luckily our break is quite long. First, the reinforcements finally arrived. Or what's left of them at least. Supposedly, there were 250 of them. Only 78 survived the continuous whizz-bangs. 

One of them was missing an arm. Another two were missing both of their legs. Their wagon also got blown apart. They had to walk the few miles leading up to here. Poor lads. At least they could finally eat now.

Right, the food. The food last winter up until now was crap. Our bread was cold and stale, we have been eating horse and beetroot soup for the last week. It's getting unbearable. The only thing good here is the whiskey. It's basically the only thing that keeps me going. And with an occasional smoke of Woodbine? It gives me peace in mind from the horrors that we've seen here.

Another thing I want to say, a commanding officer encouraged us to send some letters to our loved ones. Well, I replied saying that my parents and relatives were all dead already, I only have Elsie left, so I wrote a letter for her. I'm not sure if it will even get to her, but hey, it's worth a try.

There goes another one. Another Tommy painting the trenches red. These whizz-bangs are getting worse. Lads dying every few minutes. It's just more to clean up. It looks like this poor lad got opened in half. 

Last thing I want to mention, I heard rumors about an upcoming attack by the Jerry's in the Ypres Salient, although I'm not sure if I believe it yet. I guess I'll have to see.

\----

22nd April, 1915

Well, I guess the rumors might be true then. My division was moved to the front lines of the Ypres Salient, great news for any of the Fritz's artillery. Tommy's are getting dropped left and right. Some are being sent flying in the air, some are getting turned to soup. Some wanted to see the Jerry's, only to get a new hole through their forehead. This is- what.

\--

6:47pm

All hell broke loose.

Around about 5:00pm, as I was writing my previous entry, someone shouted "Gas! Get your masks!" before getting a hole through his face himself. There weren't enough gas masks. Luckily, I had one in my bag, but not everyone was so lucky.

As I was putting it on, a lad tried stealing it from me. I punched him, sending him to the ground. He started crying. As I finished putting it on, I could see the greenish-yellow cloud of gas slowly heading towards us. 

It filled the trenches, causing a lot of my fellow men to drop on the ground, coughing. They grabbed and clawed on their throats, but it was only a matter of time before they went silent. The sight of it was horrible. 

Men stumbling over, trying to find something to cover their mouths with. Some tried wrapping their mouths with bandages. It was no use though. They coughed out chunks of their lungs. I could see the horror and fear in their eyes. Especially the one who I punched. We both looked each other dead in the eye, and he was still lying on the ground.

Some couldn't take it. Some made a new hole through their forehead, from under their chin, some to the side of their head, some through the mouth. It was... I don't know. It's something that words almost couldn't describe. The horror that words could not explain alone. It was beyond terrible. Beyond horrible. The inhumanity of this, it's- I can't explain it.

No. Someone just said the Jerry's are coming.

\----

24th April, 1915

If you think that monsters aren't real, you are wrong. Monsters do truly exist, and each one of them looks like you and me.

The past few days have been... horrible to say the least. We were going back and forth, reclaiming land only for it to be taken hours later.

I have failed to mention a few things in my past few entries, and I would like to write them here. First, we were not alone. Alongside us here at the Ypres Salient, are our allies. Canadians, French, Algerians, and currently, some Belgian reinforcements are arriving to aid us. The gas attack basically killed half of our allies which is terrible. The French suffered the most, lots of them didn't even have gas masks.

After the gas attack though, the Jerry's followed and breached our positions. We fought. Melee and ranged combat. Guns, bayonets, trench clubs, hatchets, spades, even our helmets, anything we could use. Soldiers from both sides were getting new holes. Both Tommy's and Fritz's were being dropped left and right.

Some of our friends didn't make it. Even Lieutenant Milby got a bayonet through his lung. Young lads, hopelessly screaming, calling for their mother, while slowly dying on the ground. There was this one Fritz officer who tried shooting me. We struggled, but eventually, I got the best of him. I placed 3 bullets in his belly, before opening his neck.

I tried to do my best. We all did. But what do we get in return? The bloodshed, the suffering, the amount of casualties? I know I said this already, but it's just horrible. There were too many this time. We had to retreat again.

There, I learned something. War can truly turn people to monsters themselves. But with their leaders' greed for power, is it worth sacrificing the thousands of good men?

\----

25th April, 1915

I'm glad I actually even managed to write this, but I'm going to keep it quick. Yesterday, our allies got pushed back to the next few sets of trenches, so now this trench where I'm currently at is occupied by the Jerry's â€” I think. I don't know. It's a foggy day today, and I'm hearing footsteps. It's almost dark anyways, I'm going to try to get out of here. I wish myself luck.

\--

9:54pm

I made it. Oh my god. That was terrifying. I had to navigate at least 2 kilometers of our trench before I got out. The fact that imminent death could potentially be hiding in every corner I round is horrifying to think of. And while doing it in the dark, with only your oil lantern as your source of light? It was dreadful.

Along my way though, I didn't encounter any Fritz's and Jerry's. But I keep hearing footsteps in those trenches. I hear them from everywhere. From atop, from behind the corner, and most horribly, from behind me. But everytime I try to look at where the footsteps were coming from, I don't see anyone in sight. It creeps me out.

I think I should sleep. It's very late and we're planning to take back our trenches tomorrow. Goodnight for now.

\----

26th April, 1915

In about thirty minutes, the first wave is going to go over the top. It should be followed by the second and third one. I hope they succeed. Luckily, I wasn't part of them. I was ordered to shoot whoever returns.

\----

2:34pm

We've taken the trenches. I'm now heading towards the front lines again. Even if I didn't like it, I had to place a hole on a few foreheads. They were still young, they were scared, they didn't want to die, but I didn't either, so I followed the orders. As of now, no progress has been made by the enemy. The Canadians specifically helped the most. They planned and did most of the counter-attacks. If we didn't have them, we could've lost by now. Oh man. The amount of bodies, the pieces, the smell. Some of these are already months old by now.

I think I'm going to have a rest now. There's a small celebration later tonight. I'm just gonna have a little nap.

\----

13th June, 1915

Oh finally, I found it. I've been looking for this notebook for the past month now, how did it end up in this dugout? I don't exactly remember, but I have some news I have to write here. First off, After that counter-offensive a few months ago, there hasn't been an attack from the Jerry's thankfully. Although, small night raids began to appear then, and it's quite terrifying to think about getting killed in your sleep.

But frankly, I don't even know why they do those either. I just don't think it's worth it to have your belly opened just to kill a bunch of enemies.

The whizz-bangs though, those still frequency appear. Every day, I see at least 2 people getting turned to soup and more people losing some of their limbs. Sure, losing limbs is horrible, but at least they can go back to blighty. Good for them. Oh, I'm being called by Lieutenant Anderson. I'll write back again later.

\--

1:24pm

Okay. Lieutenant Anderson told me that me and a couple of other lads were going to be transferred to the "Loos-en-Gohelle" region of France, whatever that means. But at least I'm finally able to see new stuff again. I'm getting sick of these trenches, seeing the same bodies for months now. Almost a year. Oh by the way, Lieutenant Anderson is our new Lieutenant. He replaced Lieutenant Milby because he passed away in the previous battle.

Meanwhile, we're finally getting some good food. A wagon successfully arrived full of bully beef. I haven't had those since I was 19. They taste so good, almost nostalgic for how long I haven't eaten them. We got 4 cans each. A small but great refresher from the things we've been getting. I usually mix it with onions and potatoes, but if we don't have any of those, I'll use anything I find.

Our biggest problem is our water supply. It hasn't been raining recently, so our water drains weren't catching any water. We do have water tanks, but the Jerry's managed to destroy the trench leading up to it with a devastatingly lucky strike. It'll take weeks to dig up that much dirt, and it'll be dangerous too.

We tried sending some lads to leap over the dirt. They did it, and they should've gotten some water if only they weren't immediately filled with lead the second they got up there. Their screams, calling for their parents before dying was the most terrifying thing I've ever heard. I can't explain it. We stood no chance against those snipers. Well, I guess the digging it is.

\----

9th August, 1915

It's been a while. That's why I have a lot to talk about again. The amount of things I have to do really limits my writing time, so I'll do it now because our break is long. As you may know, I am now in northern France. This place is quite different from Ypres actually. According to my new commander, this place is very industrialized. Buildings, roads, that kind of stuff. Other than that, the place is very hilly, along with scattered woodland throughout this place.

But what is not different, is that the place was still quite muddy, especially when it rains. And also the whizz-bangs. Lads being flung into the air and being turned to soup? Those still continue.

Another thing, the BEF were also planning an attack on the Jerry's around next month. The news was very upsetting for me. I just wonder when the war will end. I mean, it's been going on for about a year now. Surely this is it, right? Maybe this Christmas I could finally see Elsie again. I hope that is the case.

\----

21st September, 1915

Today is my birthday. My fellow Tommy's were kind enough to congratulate me, and give a slightly better ration than before. It might not seem much, but here in the trenches, this was one of the best you can get. Adding to that, Elsie also gave me a letter. I'm not writing it here because I'm quite lazy, and no one will read this notebook anyways except for me so why would I bother.

According to Lieutenant Brown, the attack will commence in a few days. That's why I wrote about my birthday here â€“ because it might be my last. Oh, and General Sir Douglas Haig is also here. I think he's in one of the nearby farmhouses far away from the front lines, but I'm not too sure where exactly.

\----

25th September, 1915

Well, our gas attack didn't go as expected. The winds weren't facing the Jerry's directly, hence the limited casualties on their side. I was picked to charge on the second wave. The first wave is getting ready.

But look what I found, it's a [photo](https://imgur.com/a/6n9209N) of me. I miss those times, times of happiness, times of innocence, wearing my father's tuxedo that he gifted to me for my 18th birthday. I look quite handsome too actually. My fiancÃ©e Elsie was the only one who told me that. I miss those times, if only I can bring them back.

Whenever I do this, I think about all the parents, siblings, wives, and sons the Tommy's here are leaving behind. And they won't even know yet, but one of their loved ones is gone. I wonder why we decided to even join the BEF. Maybe honor, pride perhaps? I don't exactly know. But all of it comes to an end one way or another.

The first wave is over the top. Half of them are already cut down. All the lives lost, only to advance in the war. All those men, they only want to see their family again. All those lads, they just want to go back to blighty by Christmas. I wonder, why do we have wars like this? They've started ordering us to fix bayonets. Until then, if I make it, I'll try to write again. Farewell for now, or forever.
