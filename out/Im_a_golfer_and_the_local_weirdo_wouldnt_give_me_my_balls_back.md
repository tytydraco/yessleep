“God *DAMN* it!” I screamed at the top of my lungs, as I watched my ball soar across the pond, only to strike a tree and ricochet straight back into the water. 

To make matters worse, that was my third attempt to tee off on this hole. I forcibly shoved my driver back in my bag and climbed aboard the golf cart. A glance down at the scorecard raised my blood pressure further. That little splashdown had put me at 6 strokes already on this Par 5. 

I slammed my foot on the gas pedal, spinning the tires as I headed down the cart path. This back 9 had been an absolute nightmare, and it wasn’t like I’d played well to start with. Sure, I’d smoked that drive straight up the fairway on #4, but if I’m being honest, I had swung so hard that I clenched my eyes shut. One good shot out of 89 isn’t much to celebrate.

After crossing the bridge and reaching the base of the offending tree, (in deep rough, well short of the fairway, I might add) I put the cart in park. I reached into my pocket for a ball to drop, only to find that it was empty. I tried the other pockets of my flamingo cargo shorts, but my hand closed around nothing. I unzipped every compartment in my golf bag, becoming increasingly frenzied as my search bore no fruit. 

Finally, I found a single ball. It was my lucky ProV1 #8. I’d kept it separate from the others so I’d never lose it. I looked uphill, towards the distant flag marking the green. A glance at the cart’s GPS revealed a carry of 257 yards to reach the hole. If I swung like the ball owed me money, I could just about reach it. 

Sure, there were bunkers all up the left-hand side of the fairway, and yeah, there were dense trees to the right, but if it stayed straight, I *knew* I could clear that creek in front of the green. 

As I reached for my 3-wood, the ominous caw of a raven from the woods along the right side of the fairway stayed my hand. I looked up at the treeline ahead, and realized it was more like a towering forest. Weirder still, a low fog seemed to begin at the edge.

In hindsight, that probably should have been my first clue that something was off about those woods. But I wasn’t worried; this was my lucky ball, after all. 

I dropped Ole #8 in the thick grass before taking aim. Since the target was at the edge of my range, I opened my stance to gain a little more power. 

“Whatever you do, don’t slice it,” I muttered to myself.

With one last glance towards the flag, I reared back, and struck the ball with everything I had.

It took off like a rocket, and quickly gained altitude, heading straight towards the pin.

“YEAH, BABY!” I shouted. “GET THERE!”

No sooner had the words left my mouth did the intense spin characteristics of a slice began pulling the ball to the right. *Hard*. Before I could react, the damn thing had covered 90 yards at a 90° angle, directly over the trees. It then dropped like a stone and took my heart along with it. Loud clattering shattered the serene silence of the course as the ball fell out of sight.

“MOTHERFUCKER!” I roared, hurling the club over my shoulder, barely registering the loud splash as it landed in the pond behind me.

“STUPID, SHIT-ASS DONKEY-FUCKING CLUB! FOUR HUNDRED FUCKING DOLLARS, AND YOU CAN’T EVEN HIT ONE STRAIGHT?!”

I’ll concede that this may have been a *tad* of an overreaction, but this was my chance to break 100 for the first time. If I couldn’t find that ball, my personal record round was sunk.

I hopped in the cart and drove towards the point it had entered the treeline. I was getting that damn ball back. 

As I came to a stop at the edge of the woods, I felt a chill in the air. The fog had thickened as well, obscuring the dead trees roughly a hundred feet in. A bit strange, but my friends don’t call me Bull for nothing. Red flag, schmed flag. I got this.

And with a 4-iron in hand, I entered the woods.

Maybe it was my imagination, but the temperature seemed to drop the further I pushed inside. Oddly enough, despite the trees being long-dead and clear of leaves, the sunlight began to steadily diminish. Soon, I was using the flashlight on my phone to scour the misty ground. 

No luck. I must have shanked it harder than I thought. Damn it.

I found several golf balls during my journey, but Ole #8 was not among them. By this time, I had grown used to the shadows cast by my flashlight. It was kinda weird, though. It looked as though they were moving even when my light was still. I’ll admit the silence around me took a little longer to get used to. Only the wind whispering in my ear. Come to think of it, it seemed to be getting louder and more frequent. Almost sounding like words after a while.

That was when I bonked my head. I reached for a ball on the ground (a Nitro) and managed to trip over an exposed root. I slammed headfirst into a mighty oak tree. Through the stars circling my vision as I stood, I noticed something off about this particular tree. It had grown more crooked than my own spine, and several thick branches jutted from the trunk in strange angles.

But the oddest part was the rotted nooses hanging from said branches. Six of them in total.

“Huh,” I muttered. “This is one weird golf course.”

I noticed a homemade wooden sign nailed to the trunk, as well.

YOUR TRESSPASSING. TURN BACK OR BE HUNG.

“Well, grammar isn’t your strong suit, eh bud?” I murmured. 

By my estimation, I had to be close to where my ball had fallen. Whomever lived here would simply have to deal with my presence a bit longer.

“*Looking for thissss?”* came a voice from behind. 

Startled, I wheeled around and came face to face with a *gigantic* man. He stood a full six-foot-six, and weighed 350, at least. He wore tattered overalls and a dirty button-down shirt. His hideous face sported a thick, white beard, and he was capped with an old-looking straw hat. Shoes were strangely absent, however. He looked as though an ogre, a hillbilly stereotype, and Santa Claus had been loaded into a cursed cannon and fired out as a single being. I can’t believe I just typed that out, but I swear it’s true. You can’t make this shit up.

Then I noticed he was holding my ball out towards me. As he did, he appeared to shimmer. I must have hit my head harder than I thought.  

“Oh, yes sir, that’s exactly what I’m after!” I said happily. Thank you!”

But as I reached for it, he closed his massive fist around it. Shadows began to move through the trees, and at least a dozen voices began whispering. The prick had brought friends.

“*Yer trespassin’”* he hissed, as he slipped my ball into the front pocket of his overalls. As he spoke, the voices grew louder and the shadows grew faster.

“You live on a golf course?” I replied. “You’re living the dream!”

Confusion briefly crossed the man’s face.

“*The hell you talkin’ ‘bout?*”

I shook my head. This guy really was as dumb as he looked.

“Never mind,” I said quickly. “Look, I’m sorry for trespassing. If you give me my ball back, I’ll get out of your hair.”

“*An’ what’s that s’posed to mean?”* the man growled, removing his hat to reveal a hairline in the single digits.

“Look,” I said, growing frustrated. “I want Ole #8 back. It’s mine. You have no right to take it.”

At this the man smiled.

“*Oh, I’ll be taking more than that,”* he said as he reached behind his back and produced a rope. “***Much*** *more.”*

I tightened my grip on my 4-iron. 

“The hell you will, you big ugly bastard.”

The man’s smile widened and he took a step towards me, rope still in hand. I stood my ground.

I swung.

I’ll give it to the fucker, he moved *fast*. He dodged my strike so quickly it was as if my club had passed through him. He must have ducked into the shadows, as I could no longer see him. But I sure could hear him. 

“*AAAAAAARRRGGH!”* 

He screamed so loudly, I swear it sounded like it came from everywhere at once.

*“What the FUCK?!”* He boomed. “*How did that hurt me?!”*

I smiled. I’d been practicing, and my swing speed had recently reached triple digits.

“I’ve gotten pretty good with my 4-iron.”

“*A four IRON?!”* the voice roared. 

“Well, I mean, they’re made of steel now, but yeah-” I began, but he cut me off.

“*WHAT?!* *THEN HOW DOES IT FUCKING WORK?!”*

“What the hell are you talking about?”

The man didn’t answer. But he *did* respond. By charging me from the darkness.

I was ready for him. I swung as if he were the little punk that stole my first edition Blue-Eyes White Dragon twenty years ago.

But somehow, I guess he managed to dodge my strike once again, as he seemingly vanished at the moment of impact. But this time, he dropped Ole #8. I snatched it up and began running back towards the fairway.

“***YEEEEERRRRRAAAAAA-A-A-A-AA!”*** 

He sounded *really* pissed this time. And so did his friends. I didn’t look back, I just ran through the freezing air, hardly noticing my visible breath or the screams around me.

Soon, the fog began to thin. The sunlight became increasingly visible through the treetops. As I reached the fairway, an entire murder of crows burst through and took to the air.

As the cacophony of caws faded, I heard a shout from somewhere behind me.

“Will you hurry the *fuck* up?!” a man shouted from the teebox. “We’ve been waiting forever!”

Some people are just rude, I guess.

I ignored him. My focus had narrowed back on to the task at hand. With the penalty drop, I had to reach the green with this shot, and sink the putt to shoot a 99. And after what I went through, there was no way I was letting some jerk mess up my shot.

With 77 yards to go, I reached for my 9-iron. A simple layup over the creek, straight on to the gigantic, open green. I *had* this.

With a swing worthy of the Golf Gods themselves, I let the ball fly. While it was fading away from the flag, it would clearly land on the right side of the green, leaving a makable putt.

Then the wind picked up. It began blowing straight back towards me in force.

I could do nothing but watch as Ole #8 stalled in the air and plummeted straight into the center of the deep creek short of the green. And maybe it was the concussion, but I could have sworn I’d heard a low chuckle from the woods behind me.

I took up tennis the next day. I’ll be good at this game. I can *feel* it.
