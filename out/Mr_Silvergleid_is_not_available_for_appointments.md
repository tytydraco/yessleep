In the heart of the city stands an abandoned bakery.

It is a high, sprawling complex of brick and granite, and its great smokestack still stands watch over the loading bays where fleets of gleaming trucks once began their journeys to supermarkets across New England.

Now the weeds grow long and tall across the parking lot, and the great ovens sit silent upon the darkened factory floor.  Only the former administrative wing shows signs of occasional life, having been refurbished as office space and rented out to small businesses whose clientele will not be intimidated by the great emptiness next door.

Tonight, as the clock strikes eleven, only one of these offices remains lit.   The rear window – heavily frosted, and recently installed – reveals only the vaguest of shadows to the outside world.  Behind it, a stout, graying, and exquisitely dressed gentleman hunches over a massive writing-desk that is entirely devoid of electronic devices.  The only adornment is a single faded photograph of a dark-haired lady, standing before a trellis that bursts with flowers.

The man’s muttonchop whiskers give him the appearance of a latter-day Ebenezer Scrooge, and the fabric of his suit appears both expensive and somehow oddly-cut.  His brow furrows in concentration as his pen flies over sheet after sheet of thick, cream-hued paper, filling each with flowing script that seems to crackle with urgency.

The desk drawer at his left elbow stands open, and with his left hand he places each finished page into it even as his right drops the pen and reaches for a fresh sheet.

This is my boss, Mr. Silvergleid.  He is not available for appointments.

I state this latter fact because doing so is a duty of my employment.  I have other duties: ensuring a fresh pot of coffee on the burner, keeping the stocks of paper and pens filled to Mr. Silvergleid’s specifications, occasionally patrolling the immediate perimeter of the office to ensure that "all is in order" (whatever that may mean) – but the core of my mandate is quite clear.

Do not make any appointments for Mr. Silvergleid.

"That’s right, kid," he’d told me at the interview, as I blinked and tried to decide whether to chuckle.  "Ten to two, every weeknight.  And you don’t let anyone past you, and you *don’t* make any appointments.  Not any.  Can you do that?"

I’d thought about it as the sun sank low over the crumbling houses across the street.  "What if someone needs to talk to you?" I asked at last.

Mr. Silvergleid smiled, and it did not reach his eyes.  "They don’t.  You know anyone who’s just gotta jaw with a guy like me in the middle of the night?  Nah, kid, they might say they do.  But they don’t.  All you gotta do is send ‘em away so I can focus on my work.  And how are you gonna do that?  Say it for me, kid."

I cleared my throat.  "Um, Mr. Silvergleid is not available for appointments."

Mr. Silvergleid clapped me on the shoulder, and his smile seemed more genuine now.  "You’ll do fine, kid.  Welcome aboard."

Now, tonight, I sit at my desk in the outer office and consider whether I truly need another cup of coffee.  On my desk sits a half-finished project for one of my architectural classes – if nothing else, the job affords me ample leisure to focus on my schoolwork.  Behind me, the door to Mr. Silvergleid’s office is shut as always.  Warm golden light spills through the frosted window, and beyond I see only the vague shadow of my employer bent over his desk.

The door to the outside swings open.

This is both unexpected and largely unprecedented.  I have by now been in Mr. Silvergleid’s employment for almost three weeks, and our association has settled into a predictable routine.  I arrive shortly before ten, put on a pot of coffee, and greet Mr. Silvergleid as he bustles in and closes his office door gently behind him.  Four hours later, he emerges and hands me a crisp stack of bills as he bids me good night.

In the interim, I am free to pursue whatever avenues of inquiries suggest themselves, so long as the coffee remains hot and the stationary stacked high.

Our cozy arrangement has been interrupted only twice – once by a gentleman in a sleeveless shirt who wishes to ascertain whether this is Nasty Boy’s joint, and a second time by a dark-haired beauty whom I recognize immediately from the photograph on Mr. Silvergleid’s desk.  She offers a cheery wave and deposits on my desk a large plate covered in foil.

"Nathan, isn’t it?  So nice to meet you.  I just swung by to drop this off.  To welcome you to the firm, so to speak."  She dimples when she smiles.

I smile back; it is good to see a friendly face, and to meet the elusive Mrs. Silvergleid in person.  She has changed little from her photo, and while younger than her husband, exudes something of the same Victorian spirit.  I carefully peel back the foil to reveal a bountiful pile of home-baked muffins dotted with chocolate chips and strawberries.

"From our house to yours," says Mrs. Silvergleid.  "No, no, don’t get up.  I know how he gets about interruptions.  I just wanted to say welcome aboard.  And…" she trails off.

"Ma’am?" I say at last.

"And just be careful," she says.  "Be *strict*.  If you ever need to talk…" she shrugs.  "I’ll stop by once in a while.  I know you’ll do great."  And she is gone into the night.

I am still thinking about her words when I realize I have finished the muffins and am hungry for more.  The perils of the night shift, I suppose.

Other than these brief interludes, we have entertained no visitors.  As Mr. Silvergleid himself said, why would we?

Tonight, though, the door opens.  And a man comes in from the dark.

\_\_\_

He is tall, thin, gangly – so tall, in fact, that he has to bend his head slightly as he passes through the doorframe.  He is clad in an olive-drab greatcoat and a battered brown hat, which he removes politely as he enters.  His face somehow brings to mind both a scheming Roman senator and a plow-horse well past its prime.

He smiles at me with his mouth.  "Mr. Silvergleid?" he says, pointing toward the inner office, and makes as if to step past me.

I am still trying to adjust to this sudden break in my routine, but I do have the presence of mind to hold up a finger.  "Um, your name, sir?"

He stops, shakes his head as if in self-admonition.  "Of course.  I am deacon Keyhole.  I serve at Mr. Silvergleid’s church in a pastoral, or perhaps an administrative, capacity.  There is, I regret to say, a problem with the lights.  If I may?"  He gestures to the inner office.

To say that these remarks throw me off-balance would be putting it mildly.  Deacon Keyhole’s watery blue eyes are fixed on mine, and they belie his friendly smile.  I look away, busy myself with the papers on my desk.

"I am very sorry, sir," I say to one of them.  "Mr. Silvergleid is not available for appointments."

Deacon Keyhole does not answer.  And when the silence stretches too long and I look up, the office is empty.

I am seized with alarm.  The outer door remains closed; deacon Keyhole must have taken advantage of my preoccupation to sneak past me into Mr. Silvergleid’s office.  My employer will doubtless be displeased, and I will lose a job which has provided me with both quiet study time and a growing bank balance.  I lurch from my chair and rip open the inner door to Mr. Silvergleid’s sanctum, a hasty apology already forming on my lips.

Mr. Silvergleid is at his desk, writing, undisturbed.  He looks up with mild concern.  "Everything all right, kid?"  He is, as ever, alone.

I blink, staring at each corner of the room in turn.  "I – uh – deacon Keyhole – "

Mr. Silvergleid relaxes and nods, as if in perfect understanding.  "You did great, kid.  It’s like I said.  No one needs to be in here."

I look back into the outer office, expecting to surprise deacon Keyhole hiding behind a flowerpot or a filing-cabinet.  "But he’s still – where’d he go?"  And I tell Mr. Silvergleid, albeit with much stammering and head-scratching, about the visitor.

Mr. Silvergleid looks me straight in the eye, man to man.  "He’s gone, kid.  You don’t need to worry about him; he won’t be back."  He sighs and picks up his pen.  "Just be ready for the next one."

I pause with my hand on the door-handle.  "Did – does he really go to your church?"

"That guy and church don’t mix," says Mr. Silvergleid.  "Keep up the good work, kid."  And he bends over his writing-paper.

\_\_\_

I am left with several questions.

I do not, for the time being, trouble Mr. Silvergleid with them when he emerges from his office and hands me my nightly packet.  For instance, I do not ask why he employs me to turn away visitors instead of simply locking the door to keep them out.  Perhaps I do not truly want to know the answer.

And I am, of course, back at my station the following night.

I do not pretend to understand all the dynamics at play, but I do not need to.  My part is simple: make coffee, refuse appointments.  At the rates Mr. Silvergleid is paying, I can do this with pleasure.

Nothing happens that night, or the next.  I do take Mr. Silvergleid’s admonition to patrol the perimeter somewhat more seriously, and at least once an hour I step forth into the dark and pace the cracked sidewalk in front of the office.

But the tranquillity of the night is unbroken.  There is no sound but my footsteps and the wind through the tall grasses.

On Friday, Mr. Silvergleid calls me into his office.  He takes a sheaf of finished papers from his desk drawer and begins to place them into a large manila envelope.  "Something a bit different tonight, kid," he says, then curses as one of the sheets goes astray and flutters to the desk in front of me.

I pick it up and hold it out to him, making an active effort to avoid reading what is written upon it; to do so would seem a violation of Mr. Silvergleid’s privacy, at a minimum.  However, my eye cannot help but catch a fragment or two as he thanks me and returns it to the stack:

*…Legionnaire’s Daughter and the Duchess are especially dangerous –*

*…guardian can ultimately can be neutralized only by –*

*…used to open directly to the Orangery, but on my most recent visit –*

Mr. Silvergleid seals the envelope and slides it across the desk to me.  "You’re gonna take this to a guy named Saul.  Good guy, friend of mine.  Don’t give it to anyone else.  Here’s the address."  He scribbles a few lines on an index card.  "You shouldn’t be bothered. But if you are, meet me here."  He scribbles on another card and passes it to me along with my night’s salary.  The stack of bills seems slightly thicker than usual.

"You can head home when it’s done.  See you Monday – and keep those cards.  We do this every week from here on out."

I stand and put the cards in my wallet.  "Yes, sir.  How will I know Saul?"

"He’s gonna ask you if you like steak.  You’re gonna say, only if it’s cooked right."  He grabs his coat and hat from the coat-rack.  "Don’t write that one down.  It’s gonna change every time."

I think of asking why it will be necessary to use a passphrase once I know what Saul looks like.  Instead I nod and ask: "Leaving early tonight, sir?"

He shrugs.  "You’ll be gone.  Someone might come in."

I follow him out into the night.  And though the breeze is warm, I feel a chill.

\_\_\_

The delivery goes without incident.  Saul, a quiet man with a firm handshake, meets me in an empty function room beneath a busy downtown hotel.  He asks after my health and slips the envelope into a secure briefcase, and within fifteen minutes I am safely home.

On Monday, the fire alarm goes off.

It is just before midnight – I have settled in with my schoolwork and a large coffee, iced in deference to the late spring heat.  Suddenly there are footsteps pounding down the stairs from the upper level, a sharp and jarring smell of smoke – and the wail of a klaxon piercing the air as a fully-clad firefighter emerges into the office.

He is a middle-aged man, red-faced and winded, with a long dark moustache and an air of brisk competence frayed by great pressure.  His eyes bulge when he sees me.  "Buddy, you can’t – is there anyone else still in here?"  He clicks his shoulder radio, speaks into it: "Control, suite 7 is *not* clear, I repeat, *not* clear.  I need additional hoses over here, *now*!"

His alarm is infectious.  I glance over at the door to Mr. Silvergleid’s office, but it is as ever:  a vague shadow, bent over a desk.  I rise from my chair, and the firefighter is there: standing at my shoulder, urging me toward the door.  "This place is going up, buddy," he shouts over the alarm.  "Get out there and get across the street.  You ain’t got much time.  Sprinklers ain’t even working right.  Go, *go*!"

I gulp, look around the office.  "My boss – "

The firefighter glares at Mr. Silvergleid’s office, shakes his head.  "You gotta be – he deaf or somethin’?"

Something tickles at the back of my mind.  "I’ll get him," I shout.  "You go on.  We’re right behind you."

He shakes his head.  "No time, buddy.  You got to go, *now*.  He in there?"  He points at Mr. Silvergleid’s office, steps away from me and toward the inner door.

But he does not open it.

I stand there in the smell of smoke, with the alarm-klaxon drilling into my brain, and I try to think.  I take a deep breath and look the firefighter straight in the eyes.  "Mr. Silvergleid," I say,  "is not available for appointments."

The alarm stops.

The air is clear of smoke.

And a smile begins to spread across the firefighter’s face.  He places both of his rubber-gloved hands on my desk and leans in close.

"Do you want to see," he asks, "what my eyes *really* look like?"

I do not.  And before I know it, I have stumbled away from him and out the front door.

In the parking lot, all is quiet.  There are no alarms, no smoke.  And no fire trucks, of course.  Why would there be?

My battered Dodge Charger sits waiting in the parking lot.  I fumble in my pocket for the keys, still staggering backwards, expecting the firefighter to emerge any moment – to emerge and to show me his eyes.  But he does not – no one does.

And as my hand finds the keys – I realize: *Mr. Silvergleid is still in his office*.

With the firefighter.

I stop, breathing hard, and I force my body to walk back to the office.  The door hangs open.  I grip the frame hard with both hands and peer inside.

The outer office is empty.  And Mr. Silvergleid’s door is still shut.  Through the frosted window, his shadow writes on.

I collapse into my desk-chair and begin to shake.

I do not know how long I would have remained that way if left to myself, and in any case I am eventually roused by a soft voice at the door: "Nathan?  *Nathan*!"

Mrs. Silvergleid enters, another foil-covered plate in her hands, and hastens over to my desk.  She sets the plate aside in a single practiced motion and takes my hands in hers.  "Oh, no.  Poor Nathan.  Was it bad?"

I am still breathing hard, but her presence is calming.  I tell her, as best I can, about the firefighter.  "I don’t – who *are* these people, ma’am?  And what do they want with your husband?"

Her eyes and voice are hard.  "I don’t know.  Not exactly.  But I know that for two pins I’d march in there and tell him exactly what I think of him putting a young man like you in a position like this.  Better save it for breakfast, I suppose."  She stands.  "If you want to quit, Nathan, no one could ever blame you.  I’ll see to it that you get some money to send you on your way.  Just say the word."

But I stand, and I meet her eyes.  "No, ma’am.  Mr. Silvergleid’s been good to me, and it’s the right job.  I won’t let them chase me off."

She presses her lips together.  "Very well.  I think I’d better start coming by every night.  Just to check."  She stops at the door and turns.  "Be well, Nathan.  And remember – you don’t have to do this."

"Yes, ma’am," I say.  But she is already gone.

\_\_\_

The next evening, there is a detour – a water main has burst, it seems, beneath one of the city’s busiest streets.  Traffic is routed several blocks to the west, and I decide to walk.  I park the Charger in front of a neon-lit Mexican restaurant, and a man steps out from beneath the awning.

"Nathan?" he says.  "Nathan T— ?"

I spin around.  The man is tall, thin, well-dressed.  He holds both hands up in a gesture of peace.  In one of them is a leather billfold with an ID inside.  He offers this to me with a smile.  "I’m glad I caught you.  I was gonna come to your apartment, but this is better.  Name’s Phil.  I’m a private eye."  I glance at the ID.  It is indeed a private investigator’s license, with Phil’s full name and photograph.  I nod, and it disappears into his pocket.  "Let’s take a walk," he says.

I carry on toward the bakery, and Phil makes no objection.  "I’ll be brief," he says.  "I know you gotta work.  Let’s start with what we both know."  He holds up a hand and starts ticking off fingers as he speaks.

"You’re a private secretary to a guy named Silvergleid.  Been in the job about a month.  Every night he writes, and last week he had you take what he’s written and deliver it to someone."  He clears his throat.  "Now this part we ain’t too sure about, but we think the contact is a Saul P–.  And we think you don’t know exactly what it is you been turning over to him."

"Um, no comment," I say.  "Do I need to call my lawyer or something?"

Phil chuckles.  "I ain’t the police, son.  I got a boss, just like you.  Difference is, my boss didn’t tell me to do a bunch of stuff that’s gonna get me in trouble."

I shake my head.  "Trouble?  You mean Mr. Silvergleid’s in the Mafia or something?  I don’t buy it."  I glare at Phil.  "And he’s not available for appointments, either."

Phil holds up both hands.  "I ain’t asking for an appointment, son.  I know how he is about that.  And I know telling you to get me in there ain’t gonna buy me much."  He sighs.  "No, he ain’t Mafia.  We actually think this guy Saul is working for the Chinese Communist Party.  And that Silvergleid’s selling stuff to him.  Stuff that belongs to my employer."

I shrugged.  "So call the police.  Or the FBI.  Or – "

Phil cuts me off.  "You seen anything weird, son?  At Silvergleid’s, I mean."

I press my lips together and walk faster.  The bakery is three blocks away.

"Sure you have.  I see it in your face."  He matches my speed, his face hard and focused.  "You ever wonder where Silvergleid works during the day?  Well, I’m not gonna name names, but you’d know the place.  A lot of the things they work on, a Communist spy would pay plenty for.  And one of them is a gas to give enemy soldiers violent hallucinations.  You feel me, son?"

And I do.  I do not want to, but I do.  Phil sees this in my face, too.  "That’s right.  Just the thing to confuse the bad guys before we attack.  Or convince an innocent kid to trust a thief."

He glances around.  "We’re almost there now.  And I can’t be seen.  But I want you to take this."  He shoves something into my pocket – a business card, I see briefly before it disappears.

"When you make your delivery on Friday, you call me.  I’ll have a team ready.  We’ll steam that envelope open, real careful, and we’ll copy what’s inside.  If I’m wrong, no harm no foul.  If I’m right, we’re gonna find out just exactly what the boys in Beijing have been paying Mr. Silvergleid for."

He stops and holds up a finger.  We are close to the bakery now; it is clear he will come no further.  "Why do you do it?  Two reasons, son.

"First, we’ll pay you for your trouble, but I don’t think that’s what matters to you.  What matters to you is doing the right thing.  Your boss tried to make you a patsy so he could sell military secrets to Communists.  You okay with that?  No, you aren’t.  So you’re gonna do the right thing.  Your boss goes away, my employers are happy, our soldiers are safe."

He taps me on the chest.  "Friday.  You hang onto that card.  You call me."  He turns and is gone into the gathering dusk.

\_\_\_

Friday arrives, and I am not ready.

A powerful thunderstorm grips the city, and I awake with a pounding headache that dogs me throughout the afternoon.  Even migraine pills and strong black coffee only dull the discomfort.  I arrive at the bakery bleary-eyed and unsure of myself.

Mr. Silvergleid, for his part, seems troubled as well.  As he walks through the door, lightning cracks overhead, and he whirls with his silver-tipped cane gripped tightly in both hands.  The thunder rolls away, and he sighs and relaxes.  The smile he gives me as he makes his way to the inner office seems more forced than usual.

I pray, as I fumble with the coffee-pot, that Mrs. Silvergleid will appear, that I will find a way to confide in her and seek her advice without directly accusing her husband of being a traitor to the Republic.  But she does not, and soon enough Mr. Silvergleid’s door opens and he calls me in.

"Delivery day, kid," he says, stuffing papers into a new manila envelope and sealing it tight.  "Just as well, really.  Looks like you’re not feeling it today, and I don’t blame you.  Go home after this and get some sleep."  He hands me the envelope and my salary, but does not go to the rack for his hat and coat.  "Saul’s gonna ask if you played baseball last week.  You’re gonna tell him yeah, but the game got rained out.  Good luck, kid."

I nod, still unsure.  "Yes, sir.  Are you coming?"  Despite my misgivings, the thought of him alone in the office fills me with disquiet.

He shakes his head.  "Not just yet.  Something I gotta take care of first."  He gives me the best grin he can, and I appreciate the effort.  "Don’t worry about me, kid.  I been doing this a long time.  Someone shows up, I’ll send ‘em home myself."

I smile back, and wonder if this can all truly be a cynical ploy by a thief who has subjected me to military-grade hallucinogens.  I wonder, and in response, I ask myself for the hundredth time: what is the alternative?

And I still do not know.

I drive halfway to the hotel, then pull the Charger over to the side of the road and park.  I put my head on the steering wheel, and I breathe.

Eventually, I take Phil’s business card out of my pocket and I call the number.

\_\_\_

Less than ten minutes later, a dark gray work van screeches to a stop in front of me.  On its side are emblazoned the name of a dry-cleaning company, and a picture of a cheerful rooster holding up a pair of bloomers.  The rear doors burst open, and Phil gestures furiously from within.  I emerge from the Charger, envelope in hand, and climb into the back of the van.  The doors slam shut behind me.

Three other operators are here as well, all sharply dressed, all bending over screens or other specialized equipment.  One pushes a metal cart carrying a small copier into position, and Phil takes the envelope from my hand and places it flat on the top.  He nods at me.  "Thanks for calling, son.  I know it wasn’t easy.  But you’re doing the right thing."

As he talks, he runs a small pen-like device over the seal of the envelope.  Steam issues forth, and in short order Phil is opening the flap and drawing out Mr. Silvergleid’s carefully-written sheets.  Phil rifles through them, whistles in satisfaction.   "Oh, yeah.  This is the stuff all right, son.  You did real good."

It is dim in the van, and Phil is moving the papers around as he speaks, but I try as best I can to catch a glimpse of what is written upon them.  If the pages are truly full of military secrets, I wish to see this with my own eyes, and thus convince myself that I have done right.  As before, though, I can see only fragments:

*…crystal-capped skyscraper just north of the former city center –*

*…there are always BEAUTIES in the LIGHTHOUSE –*

*…there are always SHADOWS in the CORNERS –*

*…underwater facility –*

*…former Imperial Skyway –*

*…sunken Mectunimoth –*

I can make no sense of it.  And, despite my best efforts, I am not comforted.

Phil perceives this, perhaps, for he claps me on the shoulder as his compatriot runs the sheets through the copier and returns them to the envelope.  "It’s all right, son," he says.  "It’s all right.  The hard part is over.  Here."  He takes from his pocket a fat roll of bills, presses them into my hand.

"For your trouble.  That’s as much as Silvergleid would have paid you in six months.  And you can keep what he gave you."  The other operator has finished re-sealing the envelope, and Phil takes it from him and returns it to me.  "Hold up one second," he says, and makes a call on his smartphone.  "Special Agent?  It’s Phil… we got it all.  I mean the *full* deck.  The boys are transmitting now… yeah.  Yeah.  I’ll ask him.  Okay."

He looks at me.  "Is Silvergleid still at his office?"

I gulp.  "I think so.  He said he was staying… I don’t know how long though."

Phil nods crisply.  "Think you can keep him there for another thirty minutes?  The Special Agent is talking to the judge now.  As soon as he’s got the warrant in hand they’re moving in."  He sighs and looks off into the distance.  "I’m afraid your boss is going away for a long time, son.  This stuff…"  He shakes his head, looks at his watch.  "It goes down at midnight.  If you can hold him there.  Tell him there was a problem with the pickup.  Tell him, uh – "

I grip the envelope tighter and try to stand straight.  "I’ll tell him Saul didn’t say the passphrase."

Phil clasps my shoulder again.  "Good.  That’s good, son.  Thank you – for everything."  He opens the van doors.  "Get going.  I’ll see you after."

I run back to the Charger, start the engine, peel out into the street.  It’s ten minutes back to the bakery.  I flip a quick U-turn across the center line, ignore the outraged honking, watch from the corner of my eye as the gray van tears away from the curb.  The Charger’s engine roars as I accelerate through the sporadic late-night traffic.

I glance at the clock on the dashboard.  It’s 11:35.  If I can get to Mr. Silvergleid in time – if I can keep him there for midnight – for the appointment at midnight –

My stomach drops.  I slam on the brakes, coming to a complete stop in the middle of the still-busy thoroughfare.  A car whips around the Charger, roars past with the blast of a horn, and as I sit the full horror settles over me.

I realize, at long last and surely very belatedly, what I have done.

*I have made an appointment for Mr. Silvergleid.*

One that now takes place in less than twenty-three minutes.

My hands shake, and I will them to stop.  There is still time.  I can still fix this.

"I must fix this," I say out loud.  And I know it is true.

I put the hammer down, and the Charger leaps forward into the driving rain.

\_\_\_

I scrape and bounce into the bakery’s parking lot a bare five minutes later, screech to a halt just outside the office and launch myself from the car.  As I scramble into the outer office I am already shouting: "Mr. Silvergleid?  *Mr. Silvergleid!*  I’m so sorry – I made a mistake – you have to – "

And I stop short, as Mrs. Silvergleid stares at me nonplussed from the visitor’s chair.  On my desk in front of her sits a plate of muffins.  She stands, her beautiful face creased with concern.  "Nathan?  Whatever’s the matter?  You look like – "

I wave my arms at her like a crazy person.  "*I made an appointment!*"  I shout.  "I didn’t mean – it doesn’t matter!  *We have to warn him!*"  I glance back at the outer door, expecting to see a SWAT team crashing through at any moment, but for now there is only the rain.

She breathes in through her nose and out through her mouth.  "Okay.  It’s going to be okay, Nathan.  We’ll do it together."  She glances at the inner door.  "I’ll go first, all right?  He might take it better coming from me."

This is my screw-up, and I should take the heat – but I am grateful for the support.  "Okay," I say.  "Thank you."

"It’s my pleasure, Nathan," she says.  She turns, grasps the knob of the inner door, flings it open.  She strides through, and I am close behind.

"*TO YE OLIPHAUNT!*" she shouts as she crosses the threshold.  "*KEEPER OF* – oh!"

She stops, and I stop behind her.  For Mr. Silvergleid is not at his desk.

In his place sits the upper half of a department-store mannequin, clad in a fraying top-hat which superficially resembles Mr. Silvergleid’s.  The photo of Mrs. Silvergleid is gone from the desk, and in its place sits a single sheet of cream-colored paper covered in large block letters.

*YOU’RE BOTHERED*, it says.  The paper is turned so as to be easily readable by someone walking in the door as we just have.

Mrs. Silvergleid regards the scene, and she *hisses*.  She marches over and crumples the paper viciously in one hand –

And the room is filled with a sudden *BANG BANG BANG* as the rear door to the street, locked and bolted as it always is, judders in its frame against a series of brutal impacts.  With a final massive blow, the lock bursts from its moorings, and as the door swings open Phil charges through the gap.  His suit is immaculate as ever, and his eyes are blazing.

"*TO YE OLIPHAUNT!*" he roars.  "*KEEPER OF THE TUNNELS!  I OFFER THIS* – "

He stops, stares, takes in the tableau.  His eyes fix on Mrs. Silvergleid, and in them I see only hate.  "*You*!" he spits.

Mrs. Silvergleid steps to the side, as if to keep both Phil and me in her field of vision, and her lip curls.  "*You*," she says, and her voice drips with contempt.  Her resemblance to the kind woman who brought me muffins is growing slighter by the minute.  "I should have *known*.  Did you really think – never mind."  She shakes her head, smiles a poisonous smile.

"Here we stand," she tells Phil.  "And here it begins.  We are *heard*."  She raises her hand, points at the east wall.

A doorway has appeared where none was before: a battered wooden frame, yawning open to reveal a dark, cramped space filled with dusty crates.  It should not be there: behind that wall, I know, are the offices of the Vareigated Travel Agency, painted in bright appealing colors and festooned with pictures of sailboats.  What I look upon now is something else entirely.

"So we are," says Phil.  He drops into a fighting stance.  "Let’s get you two acquainted."

"Age before beauty," the former Mrs. Silvergleid replies.  Her hand darts into her coat pocket.

There is undoubtedly more, but I do not hear it.  I have, I think – at long last, and surely *very* belatedly – understood enough of the situation to plan and execute my next move.

It is, in brief, to step quietly back out of Mr. Silvergleid’s office and make my way to the front entrance.  As I pass through the door to the parking lot where the Charger awaits, the lights in the front office begin to flicker and dim.

I close the door behind me, and moments later I am roaring out of the parking lot.  In my hand is the second index card that Mr. Silvergleid gave me.

The one that tells me where to go when I’m bothered.

Thirty minutes later, I am sitting at a secluded booth in one of the finest steakhouses in the city.  Across from me, Mr. Silvergleid sips from his wine-glass and then raises it in greeting as the maitre’d once again approaches us.

"Reginald," Mr. Silvergleid says.  "Thanks again.  I’m sorry to put you to the trouble."

Maitre’d Reginald bows and smiles slightly.  "It is no trouble at all, Mr. Silvergleid.  Of course you must both stay with us tonight.  Charles is making up the West and South Rooms as we speak.  In the meantime, I do hope you enjoy your meal."  He bows again and takes his leave.

Mr. Silvergleid squints at me.  "You haven’t eaten much, kid.  You feeling all right?"  He sighs.  "I mean, I know it’s been a day.  But you’re safe here.  And tomorrow you can go back home.  Really."

I take a bite of steak to be polite.  It truly is excellent, and I am sorry I cannot enjoy it more.  "I – um."  I try to decide how best to formulate the question that has been weighing on me.  "Am I fired, sir?"

For a moment, Mr. Silvergleid just goggles at me.  Then he throws his head back and laughs.  "*Fired*?  Is that what’s eating you?"  He puts his glass aside and leans forward.

"You know the worst part of this gig, kid?  It’s trying to balance what I can tell people to keep them safe, and what’s gonna make them write me off as a nut.  Because if they write me off, they don’t take it serious, and someone gets hurt."

He makes a brushing gesture.  "You and me, we’re past all that.  You’ve seen behind the curtain, and you get it, and you *care*.  The job’s yours, kid.  To start with.  If you still want it."

"I do, sir."  I think for a moment.  "Your wife was never really there, was she?"

He shakes his head.  "My wife died fifteen years ago, kid.  I still miss her every day."  He looks down for a moment, then brightens.  "Listen, enough of that.  Tomorrow, we find a new office, and I tell you the score.  *All* of it.  And you decide how much you want to help."

He beams and cuts into his steak.  "Personally?  I’m guessing it’s gonna suit you right down to the ground."

And do you know what, dear reader?  He is entirely right.

This is, perhaps, a good time to wrap this tale up.  I am about to head out on a very special assignment for Mr. Silvergleid, and I do not yet know exactly when I will return.

In the meantime, I want to thank you for allowing me to get all of this off my chest.  It has been immensely helpful, and I want to close by recommending that you too find a trusted friend to unburden yourself to.  Give that person a call, and set a time to meet and talk through whatever is ailing you.

Your call should not, however, be to Mr. Silvergleid.  He is not available for appointments.
