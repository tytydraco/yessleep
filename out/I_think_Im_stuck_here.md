I think I'm stuck in my apartment. I can't really explain it as it doesn't even make sense to me, but I need to get this out in case I lose the internet next. In the last week or so, every time I've stepped out of my palce, whether it's to go to work, run an errand, or even go for a 5 minute walk, I blackout and wake up the next day in my bed like nothing happened. I don't have any memory of blacking out, and I don't really remember the day before, but it doesn't feel like a lapse in memory either. I was only able to realize that this was even happening when I retraced my steps and came to the conclusion that it was every time I left the house. I texted my boss the other to apologize to her for missing work last Thursday and she thought I was kidding, then referenced that the meeting we were in was boring for her too. I don't remember sitting in any meeting. I have no notes about it on OneNote, and I always record minutes. The errands I was supposed to run also got done. I was supposed to go to the supermarket for some groceries, and everything on the list had been purchased and was in my fridge/pantry. I needed to go to Target to replace a few things in the apartment as well, which leads into the next thing I've noticed. A lot of my things have gone missing.

It sounds strange, but ever since these "blackouts" started happening, things have mysteriously started to just vanish. Not huge things, but things I would definitely notice. My TV remote, my coffee thermos, my laptop charger (thankfully, I had a spare), one of my pillows are all missing. I noticed my fireplace wasn't working either, so I called the gas company and they said I had called last week to shut off my line and that I'd have to pay and make an appointment to have someone come turn it on again. So far, these are the only things I've noticed, but I'm starting to think there may be more. I'm not someone who gets paranoid easily, but I'm starting to worry that someone has access to my apartment. The only reason I would doubt it though is because they aren't taking anything valuable. There's no signs of forced entry, I've never printed another key to my place and the alarm hasn't been triggered so I'm unsure how they would even access my place. I feel like I'm stuck staying home now because I haven't blacked out so long as I'm within my apartment. It's only been a few days that I haven't left, but I can't stay inside forever.

Anyways, I have a call with the doctor to see what this might be and I'm thinking of installing cameras in the house. Has anyone else ever experienced this? I'm not sure what more I can do.
