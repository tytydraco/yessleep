 

I’ve always been a man of science, just like my grandfather. My father was a man of faith, and I’ll say that maybe there’s a lot more of my father in me than I ever thought. Everyone argues about what comes after you die, which religion is right or wrong, or whether it’s all just nonsense. I won’t comment on what I believe about an afterlife, but I know this, heaven and hell are real. As a doctor I see it everyday because they’re both here. Angels and demons walk amongst us, and it's so damn hard to tell one from the other.

My grandfather was a disfigured man without much of a face. When my mother was just a year old, their house caught fire in the middle of the night. My grandfather was able to save my mother but not my grandmother. Most of his body was burned and he wasn’t expected to survive his injuries, but to everyone’s amazement, he not only survived but his recovery was rapid and the doctors took the credit even though they had no idea how it happened.

In 1955 my grandfather moved my mother out to a small community in California and built an enormous mansion that overlooked the whole town. Although all of his possessions were gone, he was able to reacquire things rather quickly due to his lucrative job with the government. He never spoke of his career even to me. Whatever it was, everyone knew that he was very successful. 

The only material things he lamented losing were the only things he couldn't replace; all of his photographs. He had an eidetic memory and a passion for art. He decorated his home with hand drawn portraits from the past that were just as good as any photograph. That’s the only way all of us even knew what my grandmother looked like, and how handsome my grandfather was before he lost his face.

In time, due mostly to my grandfather’s investments, the town grew and became a very prosperous little community that tourists flock to every summer, even to this day. 

My mother met my father in college. She had been attending MIT, but she left midway through her junior year. She had been engaged to a small mousy man and just before the summer when they would be married, he died in a car accident.

My mother decided that she could no longer stay back east, so she came back to California and finished her doctorate. She met my father in San Luis. My dad was a jock, but he was a man of God first, and he would tell you that but only if you asked him. My father was a perfect specimen of a man. He was a quarterback in college and from all accounts if he hadn’t had a near fatal brain injury during his sophomore year, he would have been better than Marino or Montana. Apparently he was an honors student before he got hurt. He was never accused of being a genius after his accident, but he got along about as well as most people.

He and my grandfather never got along, but he kept my mother happy, and I always thought that was why my grandfather tolerated him and his religion.

My grandfather thought the idea of religion to be foolish and utterly useless, but he was a polite man to a fault, so the only people that knew his true feelings on the matter were just his close family. The three of us. 

My father, rest in peace, was always trying to convert my grandfather and despite my grandfather’s ribbing about believing in a magic man in the sky, he took it in stride and never quit trying until just before he passed.

I grew up in the small town that my grandfather built. Before I was born, my parents had two other children who died of SIDS. After my sister passed, my mother didn’t want to live in the city anymore, so she and my father moved back home. Once she had time to grieve and plenty of my grandfather’s council about the benefits of never giving up, she tried again with my father. I was born later that year. My father opened a moderately successful tire shop and my mother would mostly write papers and journals from home and a couple of times a month, she would commute to the bay area for lab work.

When I was eight, I was diagnosed with cancer. I was not expected to live. I started having terrible nightmares of dying. My mother and father prayed over me every night, and the nights that they did not were the nights I would go and stay with my grandfather. 

The nightmares were worse in his house. I would wake up in cold sweats swearing that I could hear people screaming. The sounds echoed through the halls. But I loved my time with him. He taught me chess that summer and he would read to me all of the time. Not children's books, or age appropriate books, he read from books on philosophy and science. He gave me attention and talked about things that I was curious about. Things I could never speak of with my father. 

I suppose I could have talked about those things with my mother, but I think she shied away from them while my father was around. He wasn’t as bright as my mother or my grandfather, and he knew it. I think my mom didn’t want to make him feel like he was less.

One night, I remember vividly, my grandfather started talking about the placebo effect and psychosomatic healing and the powers of the mind. He turned off all the lights in that great big mansion and pulled a candy from his pocket. The only light was coming from the fireplace. We had been sitting in our two chairs next to it while he was reading from Leibniz. He moved forward in his chair and held the candy up. The fire only illuminated half of his scarred face.

*“I want you to think young man. I want you to think that this is a miracle in my hand. This miracle is a gift that I give to you. It has come with great pain and sacrifice, so when you take it, feel the weight of those things. Honor everything it took to put that miracle in your hand. Here, take it now. That miracle will heal you. I need you to believe that. I need you to trust me. And I need you to keep this secret between us. Eat it and know that it will cure you.”*

I ate the candy. It was the same candy that my grandfather always had stashed somewhere. It did taste slightly different, but not enough to make me think anything of it.

That night I went to bed, and I woke up in the middle of the night to the nightmares and the screams. I wandered through the house, but I couldn’t find my grandfather. 

I was burning up, and eventually I found myself outside walking the grounds. 

At one point, I heard something calling to me. There in the shadows was a monster crawling along the ground. It made terrible sounds and I remember wetting myself at the sight of it. I was frozen in horror and it was getting closer. It had no legs and its face was missing. It was naked and covered in boils. Just as it reached out for me, I lost consciousness.

I woke up in the hospital a few days later. My grandfather had found me outside. I had almost died from a fever. I told my grandfather and my parents about the monster. They had explained that I was delirious. 

One month later, my cancer disappeared. I tried to speak to my grandfather about it, but I was shushed and reminded that it was our secret. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to be a doctor. 

As I got older, I was fascinated with the thought of the brain being able to heal the body. I devoured any and every medical journal in my mom’s library. To humor my father, I would occasionally let him catch me reading his bible. I was a normal kid in that regard. I thought my father was a moron, but he was a kind moron who tried to see the good in people. I felt sorry for him.

Several years went by, and I was known as the rich kid in school, even though my father was very tight with the purse strings and insisted that my grandfather not spoil me. There were heated arguments and of course my mother was in the middle. My mother was the balance between the two of them, the cabin of the plane holding the left and right wings to keep the entire thing from crashing. 

As it always does in relationships like that, the strain becomes too much and sooner or later, one has to admit to themselves that the plane is going to go down. You’re left with a harsh choice of which side you want to plummet to the earth with. That decision came for my mother in 1994. 

That summer, right after my junior year, several tourists went missing out near the lake. All of them were children. People go missing or die in the mountains of California every year, and around our town, it's no different. Every year there’s at least two or three. But when it’s all children, that’s another story. 

For me though, there were other things going on to distract me from it. I was a teenager headed for college and ultimately med school. I played every sport and I was good at all of them. I was also hopelessly in love with a girl. Selma Tarpey. And one night in July, she told me we were going to have a baby. We had both discussed the options, but we both knew even before we started talking about them that we were going to keep it.

Selma knew that I was going to tell my parents, but she was terrified of telling hers. Her parents were the holy rollers of our town and she was fearful of how they might react. I told her that it didn’t matter. We loved each other and we were still going to finish high school and go to college. I was going to ask her to marry me right then and there, but she stopped me. She wanted to wait. She wanted it to be special, not just because we were pregnant. We left each other and we agreed that we were going to tell our parents. She said she didn’t want me to be there when she told hers, which of course, I was perfectly fine with. They weren’t very fond of me and I had a feeling that was about to sour to outright hatred once they got the news.

I told my parents and my grandfather. My parents were very supportive, but my grandfather was silent. That is, until my father asked about our impending marriage. My father started to preach to me about respecting Selma and how a man is supposed to treat a woman. He expected me to marry her before the baby was born. No matter how I pleaded my case, my father was insistent.

“Son, do you love her?”

“Yes.”

“Are you going to get married eventually anyway?”

“Yeah.”

“Then your mother and I will be there for you. We’ll help in every way we can. When you find the right one, you don’t let it dangle from the line. You reel it in. Honor her son.”

My grandfather flew into a rage. I have my grandfather’s memory, and I wish I didn’t. I remember everything about that night.

*“Honor her?! You’re as reckless with my grandson as you have been with my daughter! You, the man who convinced my daughter to aim lower than her capabilities! You have taken my daughter, but I will not allow you to take my only grandson! You will not dictate how his life will be! He is special and he shouldn’t be setting aside his life for a common little slut!”*

None of us had ever seen my grandfather so upset over anything. My father, ignoring my mother’s pleas to calm down, kicked my grandfather from their home. I was furious at my grandfather for what he said about Selma, but I was furious at my father for causing the whole scene in the first place. Once my grandfather was ousted my father turned to me. 

“You love this girl?!” I nodded but I kept my mouth tightly closed. I wanted to punch him. “You want to marry her?” Again, I nodded. “Then you don’t ever let another man speak about her that way. Not anybody! Until he apologizes to you and to your mother, your grandfather is not welcome in this home!” He looked to my mother who hadn’t stood up from the table. He hung his head and took on a more submissive tone with my mother. “Or am I wrong?”

“No.” My mother sighed. She looked at my father and stood up. “No you’re right. But we’re not going to dictate when they’re getting married either.”

My father lowered his head and eventually nodded in agreement with my mother. “Okay. If there’s one thing I know in this life, your mother is always right. I’m sorry son.”

The next morning, we found that it was all for nothing. Selma had taken her own life. Her parents admitted that their conversation had not gone well, but to their knowledge, Selma had gone upstairs and stayed in her room the rest of the night. The next morning they found her at the end of a rope hanging from an oak tree. Her parents were inconsolable and would never forgive themselves for what they had driven their daughter to, nor would I.

I was devastated. I thought my whole world had come to an end, but then things got worse. Three days later, my father was a wanted man, and I knew that even in hell, there’s always a lower place to fall.

One of my father’s employees had found a pair of childrens underwear in his office. My father hadn’t gone into work that day, and no one knew where he was. Several policemen searched our property that afternoon and declared it a crime scene. Evidence had been found of two of the missing children. My mother and I stayed at my grandfather’s house.

That night, after my mother had taken enough pills to allow her to sleep, I sat with my grandfather by the fire. We had not said a word to each other all evening. 

*“Son. I want you to understand that although I upset you, I want what’s best for you. My only loyalty is to you, and in that case, the ends justify the means. I should have said it much more thoughtfully. I’m usually far more careful before I speak. I’m not a perfect man. As for your father… Perhaps it’s to be blamed on his head injury in college…I believe that in time, masks that certain types of people wear always come off. People can’t hide who they are forever. What happened to your brother and sister…I have always wondered…”*

He couldn’t finish the thought out loud. I was a year away from finishing high school, but even then I knew the odds of two children dying like that. I started questioning everything about my father that day, and I can now honestly say that I have never stopped until recently.

My father was found three weeks later floating in the lake with a single gunshot to the head. A note was found in a ziploc bag in his pocket. It simply said, “I’m sorry.” Enough evidence was found on our property to pin three of the missing children on my father. Their bodies were never recovered. Eight children went missing that summer and after my father died, there were no further incidents.

In one week, I lost the girl I loved, our baby, and my father.

Life, as it does, went on. My mother and I lived with my grandfather until I graduated high school and went off to college. My mother has been in and out of therapy ever since they found my father. She has sworn my father’s innocence ever since, causing her to lose her job and her reputation. I avoid the subject with her. She writes children’s books under a pseudonym now and keeps to herself. She still has my father’s ashes in her home.

I buried myself in school and ultimately, my research. I’m currently a pioneer in neural regenerative research. I’ve never married. I’ve never forgotten my Selma. I guess there was always a part of me that held onto that hope that I’ll see her and our baby someday.

 Last week, just before my 45th birthday, my mother and I received the news that my grandfather had died peacefully in his sleep. Honestly, it wasn’t much of a surprise. He never really told anyone how old he was, but he had to have been pushing a hundred if not over.

The whole town came to his funeral. He donated generously to people and causes his whole life. There were even some members of the military and some rather wealthy looking people that no one knew. My mother didn’t go. She can’t go back to our old town. I took a rose for her to put on the casket.

My grandfather left me a letter. It was sitting on his chair next to the fire in an envelope. He knew he wasn’t too much longer for this world. I strolled through that giant mansion with the envelope in my hand. I always felt like a child when I walked through it. I stared at all the hand drawn portraits littering the walls. He never went back to photographs, just the ones he drew from his mind. 

I walked up to his bedroom and opened the letter while I sat on his bed.  

*“Son, I am no longer here and all that I have left, I give to you. There is a small key in my bedside table. Take it. In the pantry down stairs, the shelves on the right will pull away to reveal a door. Use the key there.*

*Opa”*

I found the key and then I found the door. Behind it, I found a metal flight of stairs going down. At the bottom of those stairs, I found my grandfather’s private lab. It was easily the size of the interior of his home. Several walls were lined with thousands upon thousands of journals, all handwritten by my grandfather. There was an old roll top desk against one wall, and above it was a hand drawn picture of my grandfather in his youth that made my blood run cold. There was another letter waiting for me on the desk.

*“Son, life is sacrifice and when you are in pursuit of perfection, nothing is safe from sacrifice. In my youth, to continue my work, I sacrificed my country, my language, my identity, my wife, and my face. As I said, all masks eventually fall away. I owe it to you to finally be the man I could not be in front of you. The real me is looking down on you from the frame above my desk.*

*Selma and your father are the only ones I regret. I regret them for the pain it caused you and your mother. I am sorry. They were getting in the way. I had no choice. Please believe me when I say that they did not suffer, nor did I use them for any of my research. Had I not had the fortitude to carry out unpleasant things, you never would have been. Your mother would have married before she met your father. Her fiance was of a poor stock, and nothing good would have come from their union.*

*Your brother and your sister, they were also not the quality of human that our line deserves. You were. You are.*

*All the others were necessary evils. Some of that human loss is to thank for your recovery from cancer. Which brings me to what is important. Because you have always been a man of science in spite of your father’s unfortunate influence, I know that you will be honored by what I have left you.*

*The journals in this room are teeming with discoveries and cures. Things I could not share with the world due to the close mindedness of stupid people. Had I shared them, the people I’ve worked for in the government would have taken the credit and I would have been relegated to continue to work in the shadows anyway. Now they are all yours. You can take the credit for them, and I have detailed instructions on how you can do so without getting your hands dirty. That was my job. You can continue our family's work. As you read through them, the justification for all the unpleasantness will be clear as crystal.I go to my grave happy to know that you finally be able to truly know your Opa.”*

I found photographs in the lab that would prove my grandfather's guilt in regards to the murder of seventy six human beings. All of the journals, audio recordings, and video of his experiments were burned in a pile I made in the front yard. All the breakthroughs he made at the expense of suffering died with him. The ends don't justify the means.

I finally alerted the authorities and led them to his lab and showed them the self portrait of my grandfather in his youth wearing a uniform from the Third Reich.

I drove to Selma’s parents. They had never moved. Their home was just as old and rundown as they were. I begged their forgiveness for hating them and I told them the truth about what happened to their daughter. I told them that I have never stopped loving her.

I finally traveled home, and amidst the whole nightmare, I got to tell my mother that my father was a good man and that she was always right.
