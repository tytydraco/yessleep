My friends and acquaintances all disappear suddenly, and no one knows where they've gone.

It was a Saturday evening at a friend's party. I won't mention her name, but for now, let's call her Riley. So, by that Saturday evening, most of the party guests had already left. My best friend and I were still sitting at Riley's table when her brother came home and asked us to leave. So, my friend, I, and I got on our motorcycles and rode off. We had about half an hour of riding ahead, and I was already looking forward to my warm, soft bed in my thoughts.

While riding on the highway, it suddenly started to get very windy. The strong wind repeatedly grabbed my motorcycle, and I had to concentrate intensely to avoid making a mistake or causing an accident. I rode with intense focus. Suddenly, I heard a faint, strange whistling sound, which in the distance resembled the noise of a steam engine. For a brief moment, I stopped concentrating on the road, and just like that, she was gone. I refocused and saw that Angelina's motorcycle continued alone, slowing down. She had simply vanished.

I chased after the motorcycle until it came to a halt, and at the moment it stopped and toppled over, the whistling stopped. Yet, there was no trace of Angelina. I turned off my motorcycle and walked back a few meters along the highway. Perhaps she had jumped off or fallen from the motorcycle. However, it made no sense; if she had fallen, the motorcycle wouldn't have just kept going. I searched the roadside and the first few meters of the adjacent forest, but there was no sign of Angelina.

I called a buddy, and we rode back home together. Upon arriving home, I messaged Angelina, asking her not to tease me, although I was sure she wasn't just teasing me. I still held a small glimmer of hope that she might respond with, "Haha, gotcha! See you tomorrow." Yet, there was no reply.

I waited another day, then called the police. However, they found nothing. They scoured the entire forest, but they simply couldn't find Angelina. When the police informed me, I immediately went back to Riley. After I told her everything, we, filled with concern, rode with my motorcycle to the place where Angelina had disappeared. We already saw policemen walking around, searching for clues. Riley ran to the lead officer and asked if they had found anything, just as I heard that strange whistling again. As quickly as it came, it vanished again. I yelled as loud as I could for Riley, and she lightly nudged me, asking what was wrong, as she was right beside me. She was probably right; that whistling was likely just a coincidence, at least that's what I thought back then.

Still no sign of Angelina, Riley and I went to her house, as we wanted to try to figure something out together. When we arrived at Riley's, we went to her room and contemplated what might have happened. It was already very late when Riley noticed something. Her brother should have been home an hour ago. She called him, but the voice on the other end said that the number was not available. She told me he probably just went out with friends, but I couldn't stop thinking about the whistling that I had heard twice now.

The pattern continued. Riley's brother disappeared, then my mother and another friend of ours. There were still no clues; it was always the sameâ€”they seemed to have never existed from one moment to the next. Riley and I were devastated. We locked ourselves in her basement and didn't know what was happening.

I went through the entire evening of the first disappearance with her again. Angelina and I rode from Riley's home because her brother had asked us to leave. I heard the whistling, and Angelina was gone. But there was more - the strong wind. As I thought about it, the same wind was there when Riley's brother disappeared, probably. It was the same wind I felt when my mother disappeared. And it was the same wind I was feeling now in Riley's underground, windowless basement, stronger than ever.

I felt a roaring in my ears. It was the whistling, only infinitely louder than the last times. I turned to Riley, who just had a broad grin and said, "That's all of them." The next moment, everything went black.
