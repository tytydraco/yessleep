G'day friends, I recently told a friend about something I experienced as a kid and they told me I should share it with you guys.

So when I was young I lived on a farm with my family that had some pretty freaky urban legends attached to it. Even to the point that a lot of my indigenous family refused to visit out of fear. How the story goes is there was an evil creature that lived at the bottom of the hill and came out at night to torment and play tricks on people.

I never believed in that stuff even as a kid but one night I started having vivid, almost real feeling nightmares about being chased by it around the property that got so bad it ended up putting me in therapy. After a year of being haunted by this thing I tried to tell my family that I wanted to move because of how real these nightmares were but they just thought I had a wild imagination.
It wasn't only the nightmares that that made this so horrifying though. Some days we'd find ravaged chickens and other days goats would go missing. I'd have friends stay over and never come back and sometimes late at night we'd hear something chasing our horse in the field and she would go crazy and scream into the early hours of the morning. Me and my sister started to believe that this thing was very real.

One day a friend of the families came to visit and stayed in the cabin down the back of the property which was the first night I'd managed to have a proper sleep in months. That night the friend of my parents had the worst nightmares he'd ever had and left early the next day and never came to visit again. He said as he was packing that something was chasing him in his dreams and when he woke he heard muffled crying outside the cabin and it was shaking as if something was hitting the side the building with with full force. The look of fear on that mans face still haunts me to this day. The man was shaking and crying as he drove away and my parents refused to talk with us about it. Later on that day my sister and I walked down to the cabin to find it was on a lean and the inside looked like it had been hit with an earthquake.

My parents sold the farm and moved away a couple of months after that. I never had those nightmares again.
A few years later my siblings and I were sent an article about the farm and a murder suicide that happened after the husband that bough the property went insane, stabbed his wife to death and then shot himself in the head. 

My parents refuse to talk about it but sometimes my siblings and cousins bring it up in conversation sharing the trauma it caused us and our friends that refused to come back after the horrible night terrors they experienced there. I wasn't the only person that saw this creature in my dreams. That man saw it, my sister saw it, my friends that refused to stay in my home saw it which makes this so much more horrifying...

That entire town is fucked. Everyone that leaves that township has a traumatizing story that is either logic based or supernatural. So many terrible things have happened there so I wouldn't be surprised if there's something more sinister living on that land. If you want to go down a depressing wormhole look up the bowraville murders where a lot of indigenous kids have gone missing or been murderer. It's our very own little Australian version of Derry.

I'm not sure if the whole thing was in my mind or a real horror story but after finding out about the murder that happened a couple of years later I'm starting to believe that thing is still there and entering people's nightmares butchering the local wildlife and terrorizing who ever buys up that land.

Fuck. That was traumatic to write. Sorry it's not my best work but there's too much attached to it that I don't want to dive deeper into it.
Thanks for reading.
