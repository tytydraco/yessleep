This is what ive gotten through so far;

07/06/24
Pearl River, Louisiana. This dead town slap dead right where god strictly asked no one to build, most probably haven't heard of it. It's like a half hour out from New Orleans, barely visible on most maps.
Drugs plague these parts like a curse or punishment. Been here my whole life just about, I'm part of the local hunting lodge and got a doublewide right near it. It's plentiful in game, not spectacular game, but game is game, It puts food on my table, and i get to spend some time away from work and social life altogether. I got a story to tell, about my friend Kenneth Sixkiller, I call him Kenny or KK for short, he comes with me pretty often to hunt, but he isn't part of the lodge he claims he "Aint part of no institution," and "Huntin' shouldnt be fucking regulated by law i bought the damn rifle i should be able to use the damn rifle!" In his hefty southern accent, he sounds goofy as all get out. Shoot, I bet I sound just as goofy, anyways i love KK hes my brother, and I wanted to share some of the dumb shit he does. I work at the local Dollar General not too far from the lodge to, You know there's always one out here like a syringe in a trailer park. Anywho, let me get to it, I was out in my hunting stand one night just looking to ease my mind after work and a fight with the wife i brought my phone to play some Colter Wall to calm down and my blue tooth speaker. About an hour in, and my music cuts out to hear a factory android ringtone pierces my ear drums. I hurry and answer, seeing KK glowing on the screen, 

Me:"What's up KK?" 

I was hoping he could tell I wasn't in the mood, but Kenny werent always good at knowing things,  

KK:"Nuttin' Rog, Just wondering if your dumbass is home yet in trying to play the game and keep getting my ass beat" 

Me:"Naw man, im out in the stand tonight again. I just had to step out," 

KK:"Man, yall fightin' too damn much lately i just....."

He pauses for an annoying amount of time,

Me:"YOU JUST WHAT BITCH!?"

I hollered,

KK:"Sorry brother i told you im getting my ass beat right now im going 0 and 10!"

He has always been shitty at really any video game makes me feel like I'm good, you know. 

Me:"Cmon KK, im just trying to clear my damn head, man."

He went quiet for a second, and i could hear him put down the controller and exit the lobby he was in,

KK:"Whats up Rog, why you being pussy?" 

I got a lil angry at him but i responded calmly.

Me:"Brother, I just...I need to calm down shits been hairy at work and hairy at home I feel like a damn bigfoot I -"

He interrupts me like usual.

KK:"Alright, alright, just.....just calm your fat tits and go home whenever imma be on late and imma a drunk too so hurry up I get emotional, like you do, after I drink."

I sat in my head for a spell, then I chuckled a little. Kenny obviously heard me and spoke up

KK:"You are a little tiny bitch Rog"

I responded back while watching the treeline.

Me:"Yeah, i know KK, I'll talk to you later brother, bye." 

KK:"Alright, hurry up and mope."

I heard the three descending beeps from the call dropping. Kenny never liked saying goodbye, something about it being too final, i think. I sat out in that stand with my music cranked for a while, watched the tree line for movement, but all i saw were glowing dots in pairs. i couldn't distinguish doe from stag nor coyote from methhead, so i didn't fire a round off that night. All i did was listen to the frogs in the music. Such a beautiful symphony of man and nature held my hand through many a rough night, i packed up my rifle and my speaker around midnight as i had been out there for about an hour. Got in my truck, which took some time to start, but no matter what, that shitbox always runs. I kept the music off and the windows down on the short ride home. It's about 10 minutes, so i got home only a little after midnight. I walked into my double wide and saw my wife asleep on the couch, i moved her to the bed and tucked her in, then i hopped on my xbox to a plaster mess of a man i once knew as Kenny.

KK:"What took you so long man i missed you so much....i.....i love you brother youre like my brother Roger."

He would've kept going for hours, so i stopped him and said,

Me:"Alright, KK we can kiss after we win some matches, my backs already hurting from just joining up, wichya."

We stayed up for about 4 hours that night, i trusted him even when he was drunk or high or just plain wrong to be honest we was for real brothers. This was about 3 months ago, we dont hang as much anymore, i'm working myself to death now-a-days, so does Kenny. I was about mid shift stocking shelves on a wednesday when Kenny walked in. He came up to be and kicked my shoes, His voice hit me like a truck for some reason, rattled my body like, he was some kinda ghost yelling through my soul.

KK:"Yo Rog, i know you here till late but if you down i can swing by and we go out to yer stand and just drink, whatchu think?"

I paused for a second acting like i wasnt sure but i knew i wouldve said yes to whatever he asked to do.

Me:"Yeah man sounds cool you want me to meet you at my stand or drive you...?"
 He cuts me off saying,

KK:"Naw man you gon ride wit me in my brand new truck!"

Me:"New truck? Man how'd your broke ass afford that?"

KK:"I got my ways man dont be a narc."

 I stood up looking at him and said,

Me:"Alright man it's a date." 

i held my hand out for a handshake. He looked at my hand and then back at me and then back at my hand then to me again and said 

KK:"Are you fucking stupid?"

I put my hand down and said 

Me:"What you mean?" 

in a very confused voice cause, well i was confused. He barked back at me sarcasticly 

KK:"I mean, you tryna.... shake my damn hand you aint my damn pappy. What you a fancy fucker now?"

 I was taken aback by his response i hadnt been around him awhile so i had forgotten how he joked around. 

Me:"You sit on a pinecone or something?"

He turned away throwing his hands up in the air, 

KK:"I shall see you after work you, fucking freak!"

 I couldnt help but laugh at him and just went back to work. I finished my pretty usual shift while chattin it up with my younger coworker, Brandyn, dumbass kid vapes. I tell him,

Me:"that vape shit'll kill ya." 

but I smoke cigarettes so he tells me,

Brandyn:"you aint much healthier." 

And shit hes right i guess. I was waiting for his parents to grab him up after closing and he asks me,
 
Brandyn:"What you up to Mr.Crawford?"

 I looked at him stunned while puffin on my cheap cigs and coughing, 

Me:"Brandyn i done told you to stop calling me Mr.Crawford i aint that old, im closer to you than death!"

 He hit me with some, "My bad." shit and i just swore a couple more times and he thought it was hi-larious. I sighed and said,

Me:"Anywho, i'm just going out wit KK to my stand before i head home."

 He takes a puff of his vape and without looking says

 Brandyn:"Yall huntin?"

Quickly i said, 

Me:"I don't rightly know."

I seen his parents pull up and he stands up slow. I shake his hand and told him "I'd see him tomorrow" Not long after Kenny shows up, i finish my cig and toss it to the side exaggeratedly. I grab my rifle from my the back of my truck and hop in without saying much of any thing, maybe a hey. We drive in silence to my stand, it's about the size of me so we had to squeeze in a tad. While we both take our respective side of the treeline the frogs sing to score this moment between drifting friends. The silence begins to grow thick, so i decide to cut through it, 

Me:"So, how you been man?" 

He tilts his head back, cracks open a can of bud light, takes a swig and then speaks,

"Great! Damn child support is draining me and my hours keep being cut. That truck aint really mine its my pops, im staying wit him at the moment." 

All i could think to say was, 

"GYAT DAYUM!!"

 Which Kenny found excessively funny, i still dont really know why. He controls himself for just a moment to say, 

KK:"Ahh man Rog, aint too much to say to that i know."

 Not really sure if I'm in the clear to joke, I just say, 

Me:"You're kinda Screwed KK."

 He chuckles to himself and replies,

KK:"Kinda?" 

We both freeze for a moment as the starry eyes dance in the tree's, always a mystery to what they could be we hold on the trigger. He breaks fhe silence this time,

KK:"Man I've been out hunting a ton lately..."
 
Me:"Yeah?" 

I say with my eye in the scope scanning the tree's. 

KK:"Yeah," 

he responds leaning back with his drink gripped tightly, 

KK:"Yeah, I hate being near my pops, he loves to judge just like God taught him, talkn bout 'You need to get a new job.', 'Why don't you get another trailer, stop eating my food?' Like damn pops i know what i need to do i'm trying to get back on my fucking feet like..." 

He paused probably realising, he shared more of himself he wanted to. A hard silence hits bith of us for a few minutes until we hear a rustling from the treeline. Without speaking Kenny surveyed his section, a buck pops out to explore an area most likely seen as forbidden to his kind. 
Kenny with a deadpan disposition says,

KK:"Got him." 

A stillness falls over the earth, this one moment felt far too impactful for such a inate situation. I plug my ears with ear plugs and cover them with my hands, barrel flashes like the first and last picture of the deer. A loud bang cracks the atmosphere, and the deer topples over. Kenny stares down the barrel for a moment and sighs, i pat his shoulder and say, 

Me:"Damn right you got him."

 I exit the stand with Kenny not too far behind. He stops right at the deer and says quietly, 

KK:"Told you Rog, We should do this more often." 

I pick up the deer and toss it over my shoulder and say, 

Me:"Of course bud, anytime we can both make it."

We drag the buck up to his truck, skin it, and clean it. And then we load it up, after we're done we heard the sound of barefeet hitting concrete. Kenny readys his rifle first i follow soon after with a quick, 

Me:"the fuck is that?" 

Not even a minute after this i hear kenny behind me shout, 

KK:"Hey hey, Stop right fucking there Vic!"

 I rush over to his side where he has a local meth head, butt ass naked and on his knees. 

Me:"What in the hell Kenny, where'd he come from?" 

With muddled ramblings backing him like some backround vocals he says, 

KK:"Dude just bum rushed me, he's so fucking tweaked." 

Who he had at gun point was Victor Diwali closest thing to famous round here, he had been jailed multiple times for, yup you guessed it, drug use and assault. Well old Victor got himself the nickname "Sick Vic" due to his meth indused hijinks of, public nudity and random acts of vandalism and violence. But, well at the end of a barrel he's damn near sobered up. After his rambling he exploded into a plea with us and with god. Now i dont remember much of what he said but one thing that stuck with me since it happened which has been like a week now was he said 

Sick Vic: "Cmon man i just wanted to see the big dog i wanted to see the big dog listen to it howl people youll love it the poeple in the trees love it, my people my people love it oh youd would love it my people." 

Bruises covered his paper thin body, needle marks i stood there astonished, while the forest seemed to errupt. The frogs sang and the coyotes and wolves were screaming at the moon above.

Sick Vic:"Le loup-garou nous apportera la lune chér. il aime violemment chér, sois tranquille et calme pour l'homme-loup, HA HAHA HA HA HA!"

His whole body shook, his hand reached the moon, he starts crying and wore the most disgusting maggot filled toothless smile there ever was,

Sick Vic:"LA LUNE CHÉR, J'ADORE LA LUNE CHÉR! J'ADORE LE ROUGAROU CHÉR!"

Man, he was not with us then and he wont ever be with us I think. I rememeber Kenny fired a shot off in the air and Sick Vic took off squealing, we laughed about it and he dropped me off back at work. We went hunting every Wednesday after that, and didnt see Vic for a while this is frequent with our methed up population. For the last week and a half our spot has been dead, not even a coyote or rabbit passes through anymore. Kenny has been badgering me about this every week for 3 weeks. He keeps going on about a new spot off highway 1088 i passed by it just to see, it's a huge ass, open ass field. With like a wall of trees at the furthest end, Kenny keeps on talking bout, seeing 3-point buck, droptine buck, Elk, and even boar. It seems like good hunting, so i told him this upcoming Wednesday we'd head up there to rebuild my stand in the new spot and just take in the spot. He claimed it's a bit scary at night being so secluded, but there's, "Good eating in them woods." And, "Wait till you see that moon." I'm a be packing my pistol for some extra safety, but i think it'll be alright. See you after journal, i talk to you on the next hunt.

Ok thats all there is im gonna find this "1088 Spot" and hopefully some signs of either of them, Im gonna find him, no matter who helps me.
