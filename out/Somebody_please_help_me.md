I’m looking for advice. I don’t know if anybody would know anything about this but I’m truly at a loss. I would never wish something like this upon anybody and want to remind everyone to stay safe but I don’t know what else to do. My name is Jae and i’m a 20 year old female and work as a waitress at a small cafe in downtown Tennessee. When this story takes place I was 19 and had recently just gotten out of my long term highschool relationship. I was trying to test the waters of dating again so I downloaded Tinder. I met a girl on there that we will call Molly. 

She was small and blonde and very beautiful. All her photos were somewhat dark and blurry on the profile but I just brushed it off thinking maybe she had an older phone of something. The second I saw her I was infatuated. I found myself picturing a life with a girl i’ve seen maybe five pictures of. I messaged her telling her I thought she was beautiful and would love to get to know her. She responded just saying “thanks. Sure.” I took the hint that she must just be uninterested and left her alone. 

A couple days later she texts me saying “let’s meet up tonight” and that was it. 
We hadn’t really talked but I thought it could be fun doing something so spontaneous. I was working and would be off in a couple hours so she tells me she would come to my job get some food and wait for me to get off. She shows up looking frantic. I immediately spot her and ask if she’s alright and she just blows me off and says yes. I seat her and grab her some food and drink and when I asked what she wanted to do. She asked me to come back to her place and she would buy a bottle of wine for us as she was a bit older. I reluctantly agree since we hadn’t ever talked much but I think it will all be fine. 

After finishing my shift we get in her car for a very silent ride. I try to make small talk but she seems so uninterested. She runs in the liquor store and comes back with a bottle of Cupcake moscotto as we head to her apartment. When we arrive it’s a big dark empty looking building. I’m immediately put off by this. The building seemed to be dark all inside, no lights creeping through windows. She takes me inside where there’s an empty room and big staircase, no front desk, nothing almost like an empty hotel. As soon as we walk in she locks the door and hands me the bottle of wine. I take a few sips when she begins to kiss me against the wall. 

A few minutes in i hear the sound of somebody running down the stairs. I open my eyes to see 3 big guys coming full speed at me. I feel like I cant move I feel stuck. Everything gets blurry when the men walk up to me and start yelling. I can’t quite make out what they are saying but you can tell they’re mad. She’s crying and profusely apologizing. All i feel in that moment is terrified i’m frozen. They grab me and drag me up the stairs and I feel like I can’t fight back. I can’t even scream. All I hear is Mollys sobs as they bring me to a room and close the door. They put a rag over my mouth as everything begins to get blurry. 
I can’t remember much of anything else inside of the building but I know it was bad. I got a test for sexual assault at urgent care where nothing was found other than heavy dosage of chloroform in my blood. The next day I felt so sick. I was vomiting everywhere and couldn’t even pull myself out of bed. I felt this way for over a weeks. 

A little over a month later I receive a dm on instagram from Molly. She tells me she wants to explain everything. I leave the message on delivered and try to go to bed. I can’t sleep at all that night. I need to know what happened to me. The feeling of not knowing has been eating me alive. Around 4am I decide to respond. I just simply ask her to tell me everything. She claims she was in the same shoes I was. She went on tinder and met somebody and the same thing happened to her. But after a few months she started to feel the best she ever has. She was in the best head space possible and the most fit she has ever been. She asked me to join them and become one with them. I can’t breathe. I don’t even know what to say what is she even talking about? I ask what they did to me and she just says “you’ll find out if you come with us”.

 Next thing I know she’s calling. I decline but she calls over and over so I finally answer. I’m screaming and crying begging her to tell me what they did and she tells me “It’s simple Jae, soon you will see it like the rest of us.” and just like that the call is over. I immediately call 911 and explain everything the dispatcher seems concerned at first then when I explain it all he just hangs up. I try to call three more times with no answer. I eventually attempt to go to sleep but am filled with nightmares. I don’t know where to go from here the only evidence I have is the messages but that doesn’t prove much. Somebody please help me I know they are coming for me.

Update: It’s been about 3 months since I wrote this story. I see everything so much more clearly now. I’ve become one with them. We help girls find their true selves and discover who they are. They may not realize it in the moment but the medicine we inject is to help them. I’m sorry it’s not the scary ending you would want but i’m the happiest I’ve ever been.
