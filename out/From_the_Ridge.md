“Wow, look at this.”

Sarah Drake turned her phone toward Julie Carson, who was sprawled on the couch with one leg hooked lazily over the armrest. Julie’s eyelids fell over her sharp azure eyes in a concentrated squint as she leaned closer to the glowing screen. The Instagram post showed a woman in a pretty pink Northface holding a dried red and silver flower in a cramped little shop.

“Pretty,” Julie said, brushing a strand of wheat-blonde hair behind her ear. “Creepy, but pretty.”

“It’s more than pretty,” Sarah explained, her brown eyes bright with the spark her friends knew well. “That’s Krovnya Bloom. It’s supposed to grow only in some remote part of Siberia. I’ve only ever seen it in research papers.”

From the kitchen, Mark Carson’s husky voice called out, “And apparently, Vermont.”

The caption under the post read: Old guy says it grows only on Glastenbury Mountain. Says ‘it's color comes from the spirits of the mountain’ Soooo metal. The words lodged in Sarah’s head like a burr.

By the time David and Claire Mitchell arrived, Sarah had formulated qthe plan: hike up the mountain, find the bloom, get a sample. David, broad-shouldered and calm in the way of people who think ahead, listened without interrupting. Claire, small-framed with quick, darting hazel eyes, smiled like she wasn’t sure if this was brilliant or insane.


…

“Shotgun!” Sarah called the next morning, jogging to David’s Jeep before anyone else could answer. Her ponytail swayed against the strap of her pack as she slid into the passenger seat.

“You’re lucky I’m a gentleman,” Mark said, tossing her gear into the back. His grin was the kind that dared you to disagree.

“Lucky? No,” Sarah replied, tightening her seatbelt. “Strategic.”

David climbed in behind the wheel, his calloused hands drumming a steady rhythm on the dash. “Alright, team. Next stop: Glastenbury Mountain. The most mysterious, most scenic, most possibly illegal hike you’ll ever do.”

Claire squeezed in next to Julie in the back. Julie’s camera dangled from her neck, already switched on. Claire’s fingers tapped restlessly against her knees.

“It’s not just a flower,” Sarah said over her shoulder. “It’s Krovnya Bloom. It could have medicinal properties.”

“Or be extremely poisonous,” David added.

“Or both,” Sarah said with a grin.

Mark pointed at the bright orange GPS clipped to David’s pack. “And even if we get lost, Mr. Prepared here has his magic rescue button.”

David patted the device. “Full charge, satellite link. Even if we break a leg, the cavalry’s coming.”

“Reassuring,” Claire said. “Let’s not test it.”


…

They reached Greywolf Curiosities just before noon. The shop was wedged between a boarded-up antiques barn and a diner with a faded CLOSED sign. Its display case was a chaos of dust-furred taxidermy, cracked maps, and glass jars stuffed with pressed plants.

Inside, the air smelled of cedar and dried herbs. Behind the counter, a man in his sixties was bent over a tray of pressed flowers, his braid streaked with silver. His eyes flicked up, sharp and assessing.

“You lost?” he asked.

“We’re looking for a flower,” Sarah said. “Krovnya Bloom. I saw it in a photo—”

“On the internet,” the man interrupted. “Figures.”

Mark grinned. “We’re going to hike up and find it. Heard it’s up on Glastenbury.”

That made him pause. He set down the tweezers, studying them one by one. The unfriendly demeanor in his face cracked into something warmer.

“Well now… that’s a different matter.” He stepped out from behind the counter. “Name’s Nathan Greywolf. If you’re going, I can show you a way most folks don’t know about. It's where I find the bloom”

He unrolled a brittle topographic map, tracing a path with his finger. “Stay on the ridge. If you see holes in the ground, walk wide around them. If you smell something too sweet, keep moving. The mountain’s got a sweet tooth.”

The gang of friends smiled and chuckled at his whimsical words.


…

The first hour of the hike was almost idyllic. Balsam fir and red spruce rose like pillars on either side, their scent cool and sharp. White and yellow birch gleamed pale against the shade, their papery bark curling. Beech leaves shivered high overhead, and mountain ash berries dotted the branches like drops of blood.

The canopy formed a thick mosaic, evergreen and deciduous interlocked so tightly the sky showed only in fractured pieces. Ferns pressed in from both sides, dwarf dogwood and bluebead lily peeking from the undergrowth. Raspberries and blackberries snagged at their pant legs.

The trail was hardly a trail at all. The old markers were weathered gray, paint fading into the lichen. Some trees had swallowed them almost entirely.

David was in his element, calling out their progress every half hour. Julie snapped photos of berries, blossoms, and curling leaves. Claire hummed quietly, relaxed for the first time.

It was Sarah who noticed it first. “No birds,” she said. “No bugs. Even in winter you’d hear something.”

They rounded a bend and found them: a cluster of Krovnya Blooms beside a rotted log, silver petals curling around red hearts so vivid they almost looked wet.

“This is it,” Sarah whispered.

She unpacked her notebook and camera. Somewhere beyond the trees, a low murmur stirred, just loud enough to raise the hair on her arms.

“Did you hear that?” Claire asked.

“Probably just wind,” David said.

“There’s no wind,” Sarah replied.

Julie stepped off the path toward another patch of blooms. “Light’s perfect over here.”

A soft crack echoed, followed by a rustle.

“Julie?” Mark’s voice sharpened.

They searched, but she was gone. Only her camera remained, caught on a blackberry cane. The last photo showed a bloom in sharp focus, petals curling inward.


…

The trail wound deeper. David lingered behind, checking the GPS and map.

“Everything good?” Mark asked.

David nodded. “We should be—”

A sharp crack split the quiet. Leaves rustled, then stilled.

“David?” Claire called.

The space he’d been standing in was empty. No GPS. No map. Only a patch of darker soil where the moss was thin.


…

Claire unraveled next. She froze mid-step, eyes locked on a patch of ferns. “They’re smiling,” she said. “Julie. David. Right there under the green.”

Mark grabbed her arm. “We’re leaving. Now”

Claire’s head snapped toward him. She raked her nails down the ridge of his brow and across his cheek, narrowly missing his eye, in a wild, feral motion, leaving four bleeding lines. He let go with a cry of pain and she bolted into the trees, babbling and shrieking until the overgrowth swallowed the sound.

Mark wiped the blood away. “We’re not going after her, I don't think we can help her…”


…

Sarah and Mark ran. They ran as fast as they could to get away from whatever had taken their friends. The trail markers vanished entirely. The ground softened underfoot into moss.

They stepped into a clearing. At its center yawned a sinkhole, wide and dark. Pale bones lay tangled in roots: skulls, ribs, femurs. Between them, Krovnya Blooms grew in perfect clusters, petals glinting in the dim light. The scent was thick, cloying.

“This is why the flowers grow here,” Sarah said.

The soil shifted under Mark’s foot. He turned toward her, eyes raw with desperation. “Sara—”

The ground collapsed. He fell soundlessly into the dark.

Sarah’s breath hitched. She couldn’t get enough air. Inhale. Exhale. Too fast. Her chest tightened, vision swimming. She told herself to run, but her legs moved sluggishly, heavy. The whispers came… Julie, David, Claire, Mark… calling her name in gentle unison.

Her panic dulled at the edges, replaced by a strange calm. She turned toward the sinkhole. A bloom leaned toward her, its red heart pulsing in time with her own heartbeat.

Her grip on the tree loosened. She stepped forward. The petals brushed her cheek, cool and soft.

And then the ground opened.


…


The bell above the shop door gave a cheerful jingle as Nathan Greywolf stepped inside. He set a worn leather satchel on the counter and unpacked it: a few pressed ferns, a strip of birch bark, and a fresh Krovnya Bloom.

Its petals were still damp.

He trimmed the stem with rusted shears and tied on a tag in neat block letters: From the Ridge – $45.

Nathan placed the bloom in the front display between a fox skull and a jar of beetles, its red heart turned toward the street.

Outside, the wind rattled the warped wooden sign: Greywolf Curiosities.

Nathan adjusted the flower with one finger, smiling faintly.

Then he turned away, leaving it in the window for whoever came looking next.
