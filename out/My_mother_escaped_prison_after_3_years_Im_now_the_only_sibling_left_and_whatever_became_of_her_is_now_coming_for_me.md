I lived with my brother and sister for three years before I lost both.   
(Let's call them Sam and Christine)  
We've been sticking together like three best friends, always being there to help.

Since both Sam and Christine work at the same place, they both have a tight work schedule. They only come home at 10 pm being super tired and drained. I myself come home at 6 pm and usually go to sleep at 9 or 10 so we never really meet in the work days.   


My sister was a very kind, joyful and outgoing person that never failed to make me smile and we're both always happy to see each other. It really was nice to have a sister like her, always helping me even when I'm mentally down or tired. The same goes to my brother, he was just as fun and sweet like my sister   


My parents however are horrible. My father left us when we we were six, disappearing forever and our mother was a crazy women. She hated us, both of us but even if she did. There was still some love seen in her. Even if she hit both me and Sam, I still saw her as my mother  


One day, our mother changed. She was still crazy but this time, it was different.   
She wasn't just mad and physical. She started to try to kill us, throwing knifes, poisoning us and all kinds of horrible stuff. It was like living with a monster.

Christine tried to call the Police but "mother" found out and broke her phone while she was dialling. Once that happened, all three of us had planned to run away from home and search for a place, any place to live in just as far away as possible from her. Since my sister was 18 at that time, She was able to look after both me and my brother since we were only 14 Years old.   


So we all secretly packed our stuff whilst mother wasn't there for the night. (She left one day saying to coma back the next and we used that chance) Once we got out of the house we just ran, Christine had already gotten a small place for us and mother never knew we got out that night  


Luckily, Christine saved up some money from work so we were able to afford it since it was a small little house in the corner of a entire new city.   


So once we got there and Christine got a new phone, we called the police. We told them all about that psychopathic woman and they came to our place. We showed them our marks and the pictures/audios we made from her. It was enough evidence for the Police and they immediately went to arrest her. Next week, she was confirmed guilty and sent to prison for 15 Years. It was a relief, knowing that we'd be safe and once we got the message, we jumped and screamed of joy.  


That joy wasn't long though. after a week we got a small, handwritten note from Mother sent to our place. I knew it was mother cause of the handwriting so that only meant one thing.  


She knew where we lived.   


 The note read something in the lines of "I will come for you all" but the fact she knew where we lived changed everything.   


We didn't plan to move though, she was in prison, We were all sure that she'd calm down and forget all about this thing between us. Heck we thought she'd even forget where we live, I mean it's fifteen years right?  


Oh BOY were we wrong.  
Three years we lived happily together, recovering from everything. I got therapy but the others said they wouldn't need it. but just somehow, in some way, Mother escaped. Up until now I do not know how she did it but she got out and she was heading straight to our place as it seemed.  


Knock knock.  
It was late at night, about 11 pm on a Saturday and we all were watching a movie on that night.   
Christine walked up to the door and as she opened it, she fell back in shock. There she was, standing with ripped clothes and with what seemed to be a kitchen knife. In just that moment I saw my Sister get brutally murdered by her. With not anger but joy in her face she grabbed Christine and slammed her against the wall, her strength was immensely scary. One single, rough stab with that Knife and sister fell on the floor unconscious and bleeding.   


That wasn't human, anything but NOT human.  Now me and my brother stood there in shock. Not knowing what to do we backed up but that thing in my mothers form charged right at my brother knocking him on the ground doing god knows what. I didn't dare to look, I ran. Outside. Away from home. Away from brother. I didn't have the strength to help him. He was gone.  


I called one of my friends and they said to come and get me in 7 hours. I got a small place at a hotel and waited there. That friend (we'll call him Toby) never knew about my trauma since I don't tell people about it, but he knew my mother and he said she's a kind women. Once the "change" happened he never talked about her always saying sorry for you once it was something about my mother. I always used to ignore it since I never liked to talk about her.  


It didn't matter. My friend came to pick me up and I was silent for the entire 10 Hour drive. Gone from the country and now I feel more save.  


One month later, two police officers came to our place. They asked to come in and sit down. I accepted it. They started to explain how whatever is looking for you isn't your mother. I was confused and asked them what they meant. I remember what they said perfectly:  


"We found your mother's body buried underground in a forest"  


I thought it meant she just simply died. But I was wrong. People still sighted "it" lurking around alleyways or streets at night, Breaking into houses, looking for me.   


I am being haunted by something inhuman.

It's been a weeks since the news and whilst I'm typing this, she could show up any minute. I don't know what to do, Police doesn't help me since they themselves search for it and even if I'm in another country. I know that I don't have safety. No matter where I am. I can't sleep and I don't have a job, I do not know how long my friend will take care of me.   


Please, someone. Tell me what to do. I'm helpless.
