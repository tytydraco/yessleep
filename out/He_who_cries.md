He always leaves his apartment at 5am, black hoodie, black shoes, black jeans and black gloves. I always make sure im on time to see him. I usually have to take care of my kids at this time and wake them up for them to go to the kindergarden, but this addiction made me think about him more than my own birthed kids. Its fine if they skip a week, they usually always come home and never learned anything from that day for a daycare that i pay 40 dollars each month. 

But look at him, so  beautiful, so charming the way he moves, oh god i think im going to faint over how much a god created a such beautiful man on this earth, even more beautiful than my own kids. As i walk way behind him so he wouldnt notice me, im ready this time to actully do it, ive practiced it with my kids and searched the internet to do it the best way possible.   
 

I speed up my tempo to get closer to him and as i clenched the bat in my hands and was ready to swing at him, i trip and fall face first.   «FUCK» i screamed loudly in pain .He stopped walking and turned around  «shit shit shit shit» i thought to myself and hid the bat in the bag.   A calming voice spoke to me «Hey miss are you okay? Your nose is bleeding»     «Yeah im fine. I just need to get home» fuck i had to think of something quickly «i had a few too much drinks last night because i got rejected from my dream job and my husband left me for a 20 year old college whore»   «oh im sorry, im kinda in the same situation you know? I just had kids taken from me and i needed a walk to sort all of this out»   «yeah i know, you always leave your house for the last 5 days at 5am and cry out loud so you think no one hears»   

He paused for a moment and tok a step forward towards my face «maam i think youve had too much to drink and maybe you need a hospital for that nose»  «Do you have a car?» i said «yes ill come and pick you up, just stay here» he said   As i waited for his car, he helped me up and started driving.     
  «You know i always loved having a stalker these five days, it made me feel less alone» He stated   «Oh so you already know? Thats great i was about to swing a bat at you neck so i could kidnap you and have you for myself» i stated back «My cries really have a thing for women your age, its like a damn magnet, also i really appreciate your honesty about throwing a swing at me, the others really come up with some bullshit to appear dumb and stupid, i really like you» 

While he spoke and spoke, sweat started to run down my forehead and im pretty sure were not driving to the hospital.   

  
 «Well were here! Say goodbye!» he exclaimed   
 «what the fu-»   
 «Thank you for your offering Dexander. This will sure satisfy the gods of eve for getting rid of women who sin. Your cries are really doing good in sales these past few days, maybe youll get a promotion some day!» 

 «Anything to make the world a better place!»
