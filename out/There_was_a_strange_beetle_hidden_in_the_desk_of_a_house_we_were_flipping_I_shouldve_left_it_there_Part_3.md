I woke up at 3:12 a.m. with blood in my [mouth.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lrth5x/there_was_a_strange_beetle_hidden_in_the_desk_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Not a lot. Just enough to sting. I thought maybe I'd bitten my tongue, but there was no pain. No cut. Just that sharp, metallic taste coating my teeth. And when I sat up, I realized I was already holding the scarab.

I didn't remember picking it up. I'd locked it up again the night before. Sealed it in a solid steel toolbox and left it on the far side of the room. I was sure of that. But now it was in my hand, resting in my palm like it belonged there. I'm don't know why I thought it would work.

I'm not sure what's scarier. The thought that it's getting out on its own or that it's making me get it out, and I don't remember.

I tried to let go. My fingers wouldn't move.

I stayed like that for nearly an hour. Sitting in the dark, blood drying on my teeth, the scarab just sitting there. Motionless in my hand.

I spent the next hour on my laptop, searching. Tax records. News articles. But I kept losing focus. The scarab in my hand would grow warm, and I'd find myself staring at it instead of the screen. Every time I tried to type, my fingers would curl tighter around it. The search results blurred together. Nothing came up, but I wasn't sure if that was because there was nothing to find or because I couldn't concentrate long enough to find it.

By five, the metallic taste was back. Stronger this time. And the scarab, I could feel it pulling, like a persistent thought I couldn't shake. Every time I tried to set it down, my hand would cramp. The taste got worse when I tried to stay away from it.

I told myself I was going back to finish the job. To get my mind off things. But even as I got in my car, I knew that wasn't true. The scarab wanted to go back. And I couldn't fight it anymore.

Uncle Joe wasn't due until ten. I didn't tell him I was going early.

The house looked the same from the outside. Same peeling trim, same half-torn storm door. But the moment I stepped inside, the scarab went completely still in my hand. Something about the space felt wrong.

I stood there for a moment, letting my eyes adjust. Nothing had been moved. The Rug Doctor was still sitting in the upstairs hall where I'd left it. The only sound was the distant hum of the fridge in the kitchen.

Then I felt it. A strange pressure.

Like something had shifted beneath the carpet under my feet. Just for a second.

I crouched down and placed my hand flat against the pile. The floor felt steady, but something about the shape of the room didn't sit right. I can't explain it better than that. The scarab in my pocket had started to feel heavier again.

I moved slowly across the living room, watching the corners. Nothing was visibly warped, but every few steps, I had to blink and reorient myself. It felt like I was leaning downhill even when I wasn't. I stopped just short of the far wall. The one that backed up against the stairs.

That's when the scarab shifted.

It didn't move on its own, but I could feel it adjust in my pocket. Like gravity had tugged it slightly to the left, toward the base of the wall. I reached down and pulled it out. It was warm now. Just enough to make my skin prickle.

I stood still, holding it in my open hand.

There was a moment of stillness. Then the scarab tilted.

Its center of balance shifted toward the wall, as if it were leaning toward something.

I took a step forward.

There was nothing obvious. Just painted drywall, aged trim, and a stained patch of carpet near the vent. But something about the proportions felt compressed, like the room was crowding inward.

I dropped to my knees and ran my fingers along the trim. There was a soft hollow sound near the floor outlet. I pulled up the edge of the carpet and saw the problem immediately. The subfloor had been patched. A square panel, maybe two feet across, set into the underlayment. Same material, but the nails were newer. I could tell by the color of the heads.

The patch wasn't original.

I grabbed a hammer from the hallway and worked one of the nails loose. Then another. The whole panel lifted without much effort. Beneath it was a narrow cavity about six inches deep.

Inside was a dark metal box.

The box didn't look old. The finish was smooth, black, almost gunmetal. No hinges or latches, just a central disk on the top. The disk had a shallow oval indentation cut into it.

Roughly the size of the scarab.

I didn't touch it. Not right away. I just stared.

The box was covered in markings. Raised from the surface in overlapping lines and curves. They weren't letters, at least not any I recognized, but some of the shapes reminded me of hieroglyphs. Wings. Eyes. Coiled figures. And scarabs repeated along the side.

The scarab in my hand was vibrating now. A low, steady hum in my fingers.

Whatever this was, it was made for it.

I knew, in some quiet part of my mind, that this was a terrible idea. Every instinct I had was screaming at me to stop. To stand up. To walk away and never come back. But the rest of me didn't listen. I wasn't even sure I was the one making the decision anymore. My hand moved like it was following old instructions, like this had already happened, and I was just catching up to it.

I placed the scarab into the indentation.

It sank in without any pressure. No click. No shift. Just an immediate, seamless fit.

The markings began to pulse. Faint light traced the lines across the surface of the box in a slow ripple. A dull, cold violet.

Then the box opened.

There was no sound. No movement of parts. The surface simply peeled itself inward, like water folding on itself. A square hole appeared in the center, lined with the same metallic sheen, but the space beyond it wasn't shallow.

It didn't end.

There was no bottom. No shadow. Just depth. An open, unlit descent that stretched far past what the box should have been able to contain. It was like looking into a well that had no origin, a tunnel bored through space itself.

My vision swam. I felt myself leaning forward without meaning to.

Then the floor was gone.

I wasn't falling, not in the usual sense. There was no wind. No acceleration. Just absence. The box swallowed everything. The house. The room. My body. Sound stopped. Thought stretched.

And then I was standing.

The surface beneath my feet was black stone. Polished, grooved, and inlaid with silver lines that formed a massive circular pattern. The air was dry and dead. There was no horizon. Just an open void in every direction. Black and endless. A sky without stars. A world with no distance.

In front of me stood a temple.

It rose from the stone plain without any foundation. No stairs, no approach, no perimeter. Just a rectangular monolith of smooth bronze, shaped like some long-forgotten version of Egyptian architecture. Its proportions were subtly wrong. The columns were too narrow. The walls leaned inward. I couldn't tell if it had one entrance or a hundred. Every time I blinked, the structure seemed to shift.

There were carvings along the doorway. Familiar shapes: scarabs, falcons, serpents coiled around human limbs. All stylized, but exact. Every line is deliberate. Every edge is too sharp.

I moved forward.

The interior was colder than the void outside. Motion was harder. The air was too thick, as if it were some kind of thick fluid.

The walls were covered in more symbols. Some were etched. Others were growing. Slowly. Forming themselves out of the stone like blisters rising on skin.

In the center of the temple stood a platform, and above it, something vast.

I couldn't look at it directly. My eyes slid off. It wasn't light or shadow. It was structure incarnate. A presence. Architectural thought compressed into a shape my brain couldn't process. I saw it, but not with my eyes. I felt its shape the way you feel time passing in an empty room.

It turned. It wasn't a physical turning; it reoriented something fundamental, and I understood that it was now observing me.

Words formed in my head, like bubbles rising from a thick, oily slime.

I can't. I can't write this down. I can't even think about it without my hands shaking. I've been sitting here for three hours trying to find the words, and every time I start, I have to stop. My throat closes up. My vision goes blurry.

It's been three days since I came back. Three days since Uncle Joe found me standing in the hallway of that house on Broke Neck Ridge, running the Rug Doctor over the same spot in the carpet over and over again. I was covered in a thin film of oil, with no memory of how I had gotten back there.

He got me back home and cleaned up. Threatened to tell my parents if I didn't go to the doctor.

So I did. Physically? Exhaustion, dehydration, and malnutrition.

He berated me for not taking better care of myself. I didn't even try to explain to him. Who would ever believe?

The scarab was gone, just gone. Like it had never existed.

But I remember what I heard. God help me, I remember every word.

I keep telling myself it was a dream, or a breakdown. Some kind of psychotic episode brought on by stress and too little sleep. That's what I want to believe. That's what I need to believe.

But the taste won't go away. That metallic taste. And sometimes, late at night, I hear it again. That voice. Sometimes I think I'm dreaming, sometimes I can't tell. No words this time, none I can remember. More like the voice is just there, waiting.

Because what it told me, what it showed me, that I *do* remember.

If any of it's real, then we're all...

No. I can't. I won't.

I'm done.

I'm done with all of it.
