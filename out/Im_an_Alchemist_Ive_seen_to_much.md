I am a proficient alchemist and have experienced to much in my pursuit of knowledge and sharing my experiences help with the healing process. So here is my story.

The evening had fallen into a numbing routine. The walls of my small apartment seemed to close in, suffocating me with the monotony of daily life. My friend Ish, always a catalyst for change, suggested we head to the local bar for a game of pool. It was a welcome distraction from the drudgery that had become my existence.

The bar was a dimly lit haven for misfits and drifters. The air was thick with the stench of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and the faint aroma of desperation. Pool balls clacked sharply, their sounds reverberating through the haze of smoke and low conversations. As Ish and I played, the atmosphere grew heavier, each thud of the cue ball echoing the tedium of my life.

Just as I was sinking my final shot, a stranger approached. His presence was unsettling—a calm, almost otherworldly serenity about him that contrasted sharply with the bar’s chaotic energy. With an unsettling grin, he challenged me to a game, claiming to be the best shooter in town. Intrigued but wary, I accepted, wagering $20 per game.

As I won game after game, our conversation turned to darker topics. I casually mentioned my deep knowledge of the occult. His interest seemed to sharpen, his eyes gleaming with an intensity that unsettled me. Abruptly, he ended the game, his demeanor shifting to something far more sinister.

“If you’re as skilled as you say,” he murmured, handing me a blank card with a number, “call this number. It leads to something that will offer you experiences beyond this mundane world.”

A thrill of fear and excitement surged through me as I pocketed the card. As soon as I was home, I dialed the number. The voice on the other end was chillingly calm, instructing me to meet at a specific location in four days and to bring any tools I might need for protection.

The wait was excruciating. Each day dragged on, filled with anxious anticipation. When the day finally arrived, I stood on a desolate street corner, the air cold and suffused with an eerie silence. A black van pulled up, its engine growling ominously. Two men in dark suits emerged, their faces hidden behind dark sunglasses. They guided me into the van, and a blindfold was placed over my eyes.

The van ride seemed endless. The hum of the engine was monotonous, but the smell of leather and the occasional tremor of the vehicle’s movements heightened my sense of dread. When we finally stopped, I was led out, my head still covered. The house before me was a grotesque monument of decay and darkness, its very presence a manifestation of malevolence.

Inside, the atmosphere was suffocating. The air was thick with the stench of mildew and something darker, more sinister. The room was dimly lit, the shadows twisting into grotesque shapes. The man I was to exorcise, a thirty-year-old with wild eyes and convulsing limbs, was shackled and writhing. The temperature had plummeted, my breath forming icy clouds in the freezing air.

I prepared my tools with trembling hands—ancient texts, ritual implements, protective charms. The oppressive cold seemed to seep into my bones, and the air crackled with an otherworldly energy. As I began the ritual, the shadows around us seemed to grow darker, pulsating with a life of their own.

The demon’s resistance was relentless. Its roars shook the room, merging with the man’s agonized screams. The temperature plummeted further, and the darkness pressed in, almost palpable. I called upon ancient, non-Christian occult methods, invoking primordial forces and protective spirits. Every incantation felt like a battle against an unseen force that sought to tear apart reality itself.

The struggle was chaotic and terrifying. The room became a maelstrom of dark energy. Shadows lashed out, their forms shifting into nightmarish shapes. The demon’s rage was a tangible force, and the man’s convulsions grew more violent. Despite the chaos, I pressed on, guided by an eerie clarity that cut through the turmoil.

With each ritual, the demon’s grip weakened. The room’s temperature began to stabilize, and the oppressive darkness receded. The man’s screams turned into guttural moans, and the shadows retreated, leaving a lingering sense of dread. The exorcism was complete, but the weight of the night’s events hung heavily over me.

The First Major Job

In the weeks that followed, I took on smaller exorcisms and investigations for Horus, the enigmatic group whose emblem—a looped infinity within the Eye of Horus—was as mysterious as it was foreboding. Their influence stretched into the highest echelons of power, shrouded in secrecy.

Then came my first major assignment. Horus tasked me with retrieving a book that had already claimed 30 lives in the past week. The location was a dilapidated shack in rural Texas, a place now cut off from the outside world. The area had been evacuated, and access was restricted by police and National Guard units, who were, in reality, Horus agents working to conceal the truth.

As I approached the shack, an oppressive silence engulfed the area. The usual rural sounds were replaced by an eerie stillness, broken only by the occasional rustle of wind. Armed agents surrounded the house, their guns drawn and faces grim. The air was saturated with a palpable sense of dread, the very atmosphere vibrating with a malevolent energy.

The senior agent briefing me was a figure of cold efficiency. He outlined the grim situation: a group of fanatics had conducted a ritual that had already claimed numerous lives. Horus feared they were on the verge of awakening something catastrophic—something that could obliterate entire nations.

My heart raced with both fear and resolve. The agent’s orders were clear: breach the house, eliminate all occupants, and handle anything beyond conventional means.

With grim determination, I prepared my gear and offered a silent, fervent prayer to Thoth. The agent signaled, and we stormed the house. Each room was cleared with methodical precision, the oppressive silence occasionally shattered by the muted sounds of our movement and the occasional creak of the old structure.

When we reached the basement, we were met with a scene of horror. Five naked men, their bodies covered in grotesque symbols, were engaged in a ritual around a book that throbbed with a dark, malevolent energy. The book’s surface was alive with writhing black tentacles, and an unnatural moan emanated from it, filling the room with an almost tangible sense of nausea and despair.

I recognized the book immediately—one of only two copies of the Necronomicon. The cultists were perilously close to unleashing its dark power. The tentacles lashed out with ferocious strength, causing chaos and killing five agents in a frenzy of violence. The room was a battlefield of twisted shadows and horrific sounds, the air thick with the stench of death and corruption.

I fought with every ounce of my strength and knowledge. Thoth’s voice cut through the chaos, guiding me with precise instructions. The tentacles thrashed violently, their dark power breaking bones and causing havoc. My struggle was a desperate dance with darkness, each moment a battle for control.

Finally, with Thoth’s guidance, I performed the necessary rituals and incantations. The room was a whirl of dark energy and chaos, but as I completed the final incantation, the tentacles recoiled with a final, shuddering spasm. The malevolent energy dissipated, leaving a suffocating silence in its wake.

Exhausted and battered, I surveyed the aftermath. The night had revealed the depths of darkness that lay just beyond the veil of our understanding. As I left, the world outside seemed both distant and surreal. The experience had unveiled the terrifying reality of the occult world and solidified my role within Horus’s shadowy ranks. The Necronomicon’s dark shadow still loomed large, a grim reminder of the unspeakable horrors that lurk in the hidden corners of our world.
