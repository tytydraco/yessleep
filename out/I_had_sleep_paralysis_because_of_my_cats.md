I had woken up at 4:40 in the morning. That night I stayed sleeping in my mom's room because I felt more comfortable. I woke up because my kittens were playing with a lot of energy in the bed and kept scratching or biting my foot. I didn't want to scold them since I didn't see the point in that, I just lay down on my back with a tired face, since I was very sleepy and my cats wouldn't let me sleep.

After a few minutes without being able to sleep, I was a little stressed, but I decided to talk a little with my mom who was already getting ready to go to work. When my mother had already left, it was 5 in the morning, it was almost dawn. I checked the time on the phone and then decided to no longer care about the cats, and with a sigh, I dropped my hand with the phone on the bed and closed my eyes.

I felt as if my body was separated from my head, although at that moment because of the dream I had I didn't give it any importance. I realized I could open my eyes even though my body was asleep. At that moment I had a hallucination where I grabbed my phone and Instagram opened by itself. A Roblox video appeared to me where a man who looked like a 50-year-old Spanish man was being a pedophile with a little girl, saying completely disgusting things to her.

After that, I dropped my phone again and said, “Roblox is seriously not a safe game.” And out of nowhere I started to feel weird. A silence came suddenly and everything became completely silent. I began to hear Sacha meowing desperately as if something was attacking her. I wanted to turn my head to see what was happening but I couldn't. When I tried to move my head, it felt heavy, as if it were stuck to the mattress.

Then a high-pitched beeping sound began to be heard, the same one you hear when you cover your ears. I started to get a little scared but then it went away and I was just confused as to what was happening as I couldn't move. The beeping became louder and louder and everything in my vision began to look grayer. I realized in that moment that, for the first time, I was aware of what was happening to me.

When I tried to move my head again, a very loud and high-pitched sound stunned me and blurred my vision. It was as if it were warning me that if I moved it again, something very bad would happen to me. I wanted to test if I could scream, I could open my mouth and breathe out, so that meant I could scream. But I decided not to do it because I was already regaining my mobility.

I was finally able to move and when I looked to my left, I saw that Sacha was meowing like that because one of the kittens had fallen off the bed and she was trying to get him up, but she didn't know how.

Then I was afraid to go back to sleep since I was sleepy and my body was upset. But then I was able to get the courage to go back to sleep and I woke up at 9 in the morning and had my normal day.
