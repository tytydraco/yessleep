   The forest is mankind's primordial home. Danger and protection joined as one in the caldron that birthed the bipeds from which we all descend. In that way, ancestrally, a part of us all yearns to return to it—the towering pillars of wood and canopy of leaves—food abundant and sparse, water plentiful and in drought—all things needed for survival and also the hidden threat of death. It was a reflection of my own home in that way. How foolish I was to think of it any differently or special. 

   

   The woods were always a place of refuge and escape for me. Ganwing hunger lingers far less when you can enjoy the calm lull of nature. The dangers are far more abstract than in my own home. Crunching on a stick wasn't met with extreme retribution, nor was there anyone to ignore you. Nature knew you and saw you wherever you went. A far kinder parental figure, even if it was as absent as my own.



   Buried deep in those woods was something I'd longed for my entire life—a place that saw, wanted, and loved me. But I was too afraid to accept it. Fear ruined what I had found and tainted something wonderful. What child can resist the love of its parents? How can I deny the call of my own waiting for me out there? I don't want to leave these questions unanswered. Even if only treated as entertainment, I would like a record of something to remain behind—perhaps an open invitation or a warning, depending on the reader. 



I grew up in the most rural part of my state, where the woods would stretch for miles. They seemed to loom over everything. The roads and towns were only vestiges of civilization from their leaf-covered shroud. The forest was so dense that someone would get lost multiple times a year.



As a kid, it never seemed like a big deal when it happened. They would be gone for hours, but they almost always made it back the same day. The isolation from society and never returning, even if only for a few hours, that fear caused such extreme reactions. Sometimes I wondered if they saw something more. Waiting horrors, lurking for those who grew too comfortable.



   The blooming of relief that etched their faces upon being found was evident even to my younger self. I assumed it was always the joy of returning when you thought yourself beyond help or saving. That they were able to make it back from the abyss of isolation intact. 



   In my later years, I learned that not everyone did return. A person here and there wouldn't come back. A few times, even children would vanish in the maze of organic growth. Search parties would look for weeks and find no trace. Others would appear miles away, with no tracks or possibility of getting there in that time. Forests even now have their unexplainable mysteries unless you live through them yourself, as I did. 



   Despite the danger, I walked those same woods every chance I got. My curiosity and desire for escape and adventure drove me to venture farther and longer. I knew them better than my own home. My house and family were chaotic, so much so that I began to prefer the woods over both. The forest floor had more order than my family's equivalent. Even the bugs seemed shyer and sparser than the endless roaches, ants, and other insects that dominated my shelter.



   Arguments would often escalate into physical fights that could last the entire day. That place never felt safe, never felt like a home. Even setting foot in my family home would turn my stomach and cause me discomfort. In contrast, those woods felt like my own personal haven—my little slice of paradise away from the hell of my familial nightmare.



   But time passed, and I grew bolder and less concerned about any danger that might be out there. A sinful hope deep down that I would be lost forever like the others before me. Plundering the depths in search of salvation from suffering. I'd go far enough into the recesses of long-forgotten paths and find what my heart desired most. To my lifelong shame, I would squander it with my childlike fear. 



   Much like anything meaningful in life, the day was as typical as could be—a rush to get up for school after a night of no sleep. Yelling and demanding words until the bus arrived to shuttle me to a place that at least could feed me. Anxiety over that lack of finished work that I needed my parents for, and yet was forgotten in the blaze of self-satisfaction malaise that did every night.



   Returning to the house, it was now barren of people and any resources. The second was normal, the first a blessing. My home had a large backyard that sloped down before meeting the tree line. At the edge of the trees was a chain-link mesh tunnel with vines growing all around it. It looked like an entry into another world when you walked through it. For me, it acted like a gate that closed that world away and welcomed me into the next.



   It was a ritual for me to always enter through that tunnel whenever I went into the woods, shedding any taint from me so as not to degrade the sacred place—a form of rebirth or at least mental distance from anything else. A form of procession for the old world left to die. 

 

I completed my journey through the tunnel and made my way onto one of the less-used walking paths through the woods. I was familiar with most of the trails at this point and knew where they led. Years of hiking meant that almost all the paths I could find had been walked, possibly hundreds of times, by now. There was only one path that I had never gone down.



The path was a shallow line of compacted dirt that you would lose if you weren't careful. I had been hesitant to go down this path for a while. There was a subtle anxiety whenever I thought about going down it—a swirling mix of curiosity, dread, and forboding hope.



I always assumed it was because I knew it would be easy to get lost on it. The leaves on the ground and roots pulled at the edges covered it. It reminded me of water sweeping over the land, making it uniform again. It felt like the woods were trying to reclaim that part of the forest floor and remove the traces that man had forced on it. I was sympathetic to its cause. If I could erase myself and memories, I would. 



   I decided I would put the fear and anxiety away. Despite the fear that seemed to emanate from that section of the woods, there was also a yearning I couldn't quite understand. I could feel a pull in my chest as if my dreams could be fulfilled with just a simple walk down this hidden path. Such a simple form of temptation leading man astray. 



   So, I began my pilgrimage down the trail, taking turns and switching paths when needed. I made my way deep into the depths of the forest. The path grew narrower and harder to see from a trail into a vein, ushering me into the heart of the forest. I pushed on, but at this point, unease swept over me. Every step felt like I was stepping on glass. Something sacred was being disturbed by my presence. I was trespassing on a world that was better off without me. Or better off than what I was escaping from. 



   The unease was rooted in an understanding—a shared knowledge of the pain and destruction humans could cause. It felt like something was glad I respected it enough to see its true nature. It felt like I was discovering a place not seen by human eyes in years. I was delighted that my eyes had broken that veil and now saw what awaited me. 



   My pace slowed as the forest loomed over me. The tree branches were twisting above me to block me in. There was a cliff to my right and a drop to my left. The path had no other option but to go forward or back. There was little room for anything but progress to wherever this path would lead. Boxed in like an animal of prey, I folded under domesticated instincts and walked forward.



   It had been miles of hiking through deep brush. Now, I felt like the forest was putting its arms around me. A type of sickening squeeze that only the desperate or hungry can give. As a kid, it's easy to get scared when you're out there all alone. You imagine all sorts of noises and see odd things in the distance. A lack of stimuli forces the brain to conjure its own. 



   In my mind, I could hear my family or the few friends I had from school calling me back. Part of me thought I should. My heart knew I would refuse the call. Those attachments were far too sparse and empty to pull me away. The threads of connection broke as my feet did without hesitation what my mind had already decided. I would continue, and I hoped I wouldn't have to come back. 



   It took me two hours to go from a mundane environment to an alien one. The thin trees, as if malnourished, now stood, guards towering and mighty in contrast to their withered and frail form, which felt mocking of my own malnourished, skinny frame. I could feel the sweet breeze drifting around them and pushing me forward. The woods seemed much more alive here, bushes full and bursting with berries and mushrooms growing to my ankle, almost preening with pride as I walked by them. 



   Slowly descending the narrow path, I realized the forest had gone quiet. There were no bugs, wind, or even animals. The forest held a silence befitting the most sacred ceremonies: the mourning of the dead. I would only find what this silence held for me at the end of this path. 



   There was a thumping sound echoing. I felt it rattle me around. The only break from the quiet, and I realized it was my heart. Only the sound of my hesitating footsteps and rapidly beating heart dared to break the sound of silence that permeated here; it was my mind that was broken in return. My thoughts and feelings of fear were halted instantly. At the end of the bend, going around the large hill to my right, I saw something impossible. 



   Nestled at the crossroads of four walkways sat a perfectly built suburban home. It looked like everything I thought a home should be: clean white paint, a warm, friendly glow, and a lovely flower garden right out front. I froze on the spot as my brain registered what I had just seen. I tried to make sense of what I was seeing. How could there be a house so perfectly maintained this deep in the woods? I had walked for over two hours from the starting point, and it took nearly five hours to reach this spot. There was no way for anyone to obtain the materials needed to build something like this. It felt wrong just looking at it. 



   My stomach felt tight, a nervous tension when intruding into someone's living space. I knew I needed to make a good impression. I was in someone else's domain, and their rule was absolute. The home contradicted my every emotion with an invitation of comfort and ease. I felt more welcome there than where I had been born and raised. 



   My breath hitched as the door slowly creaked with a high-pitched whine from disuse. The most disturbing aspect was how quickly it happened. It opened as if someone had been waiting for your return, eager for you to come in. The inside was black, but a soft melody flowed from the open door. It sounded like a harp backed by a piano and violin. The surrounding woods were motionless. 



   Before I knew what I was doing, my feet shuffled forward, moving in a clunky, unfamiliar manner. I moved like a marionette, strings pulled by unseen hands, every step jerky and unnatural. Long, bouncing steps drew me closer to the house. My feet dragged with a slow scraping that matched the song from the house. Skipping with a body felt joy that permeated a mysterious, unsettling hope. 



   Panic swept over me. The urge to vomit overwhelmed my senses. A part of my brain kept yelling out that I wasn't the one moving my body. An otherworldly presence was obfuscating my thoughts and desires. I did everything in my power to turn back, to run away. Yet my eyes stayed locked on the door. My body continued to move on its own, and an outstretched arm crept from the darkness of the home. 



   It looked emaciated, how thin and frail it was. A pang of sympathy and worry forced itself into my thoughts' epicenter. With long, branch-like fingers, it gestured me forward. It stretched out longer than any arm should. Its dagger-like digits danced in a beckoning wave. I felt my arm lifting out, preparing to grab it when I got close—an urge to hold its needle-length fingers for comfort. The gnarled appendage was creeping towards me that would pull me close to whatever that thing was, with a forced smile on my face. 



   The stench of rotten decay flowed out the doorway, mingling with the scents of honey and flowers. "Smells like home," echoed in my empty mind. That thought echoed long enough to transform into the truth I knew when I first saw this place. This is my home, and it welcomed me back with open arms. The darkness of my new home lifted as I got closer. 



   To my horror, it thinned enough to see pulsating flesh that made up the interior walls. Thick, heavy drool pulled and clung to the gum flesh walls. Teeth jutted out haphazardly, and I realized that I was walking into a mouth. And that arm was its tongue, probing me. It wanted to get a taste before it pulled me inside to swallow me whole. Grumbling hungry need, which sounded so much like my own on nights where I would bite and chew on my arm to pretend and trick myself into thinking I was eating.



Maybe it wanted me to know it was there for me? Nothing else before had shown such sympathy nor understanding. Despite my fear, it wanted to welcome me and make me feel safe with its paternal gestures of care. I wanted to go home and run away from here. It was then that I realized why I couldn't do that, why I hadn't run away, even in the face of fear. I didn't have a home to run back to. 



   It was just a prison full of pain and abuse. Wasn't this much more of a home than that? I understood why those who got lost never went back, and why some were never able to return home. This home was waiting for them as a refuge for the lost. Internally, I was screaming in fear. My body walked happily despite that fear. With all of my willpower, I managed to move my teeth. My teeth crashed down on my tongue, and the bolt of pain tore through me. Alien thoughts, or maybe insidious internal ones of my own, stopped. 



   As quickly as I could, I turned and started running. I heard the music cut out and knew the arms were rushing out to grab me. A low, grumbling roar bellowed behind me. The hungry roar of a starved stomach. Or the cry of a parent losing their child. That parental horror when your child runs away, never to be seen again.



   I sprinted past the curve and ran down the path. In my panicked state, I sprinted so hard that my legs burned and my feet ached. Unsteady footing as muscles spasmed and joints threatened to give out. I saw that arm reach out behind every tree to grab or trip me up. I bashed into dying trees, which would slam to the ground like a bell. My body was carved up by thorns and brambles unseen on this path before. Sometimes, I could see its form behind a tree as if begging me to return with it. I could feel the tremors of it behind me at the same time. Hunter and prey and child and parent, the lines blurred, and so did my sight.



   After hours, I saw my house and the vine-covered tunnel. The noise of nature only returned as I came out to the other end of my backyard. My lungs felt like they were on fire, and my body was drenched in sweat. I looked back into the woods and felt ice in my veins as I saw the arm at the end of the tunnel. It waved me a sad, slow goodbye before retreating into the dense woods. 



   Since that day, I've never been in the woods again. I still have dreams of that day, though, reliving the moments repeatedly. Each time, I get closer to that hand and house. What scares me the most is how much I want to go back. I have rotted away with nothing to show, and I'm stuck here suffering all the same. Insidious normalcy can be that rapture could be denied for purgatory.



   I'm writing to tell you how wrong I was to run. I'll be going back as soon as this is posted. Some might say it's in my head. It wants to eat me, but I know in my heart that's wrong. My mind made it seem like it was evil or a monster. Life holds the same weight as a dream. Little importance and waiting for the needed end. A prison with an open door. My home has a backyard that slopes down into the woods with a tunnel that goes to that thing. A parent better than any I have ever known. 



   It waits for me to now, and when I wake from sleep, I can feel its leathery flesh on top of mine. Dagger pointed fingers in my hair like a loving mother. A needy stomach waiting to be filled. My old home is now empty on top of a hill. I walk to return to the house I chose to leave. The forest is quiet, and I can hear a gurgling lullaby that puts me at ease. A single light shines faintly deep behind a wall of trees. How nice they kept the light on just for me.
