Hello, my name is Dave. I’m 74 years old, and I’ll be dead in the following year.

I was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer thanks to my addiction to Marlboro. My older sister knew I smoked to calm my nerves, and she always used to ask me what happened that night. I came close to telling her, but now I can’t. She died back in 2018.

Now, near the end of the road, I feel the need to tell my story, even if it’s just to a bunch of strangers. My sister would say I would feel better if I just talked about it, or in this case, wrote about it. So, here we go.

When I was 12, I found a severed head, and its eyes moved.

It was June 14th, 1961, and a particularly humid and hot summer. The kind of weather that makes your shirt stick to your back with sweat.

I lived in your average suburban neighborhood with two working parents. My father did door-to-door sales selling vacuum cleaners, and my mother worked at a salon downtown – she might’ve been the only mom in that neighborhood that worked. They didn’t usually get home until the evening, which meant I was free to wander around the neighborhood, go to a friend’s house, or explore the woods when I pleased.

On that day, I met up with Eddie, a boy I had known since 3rd grade, and we met up with George and his brother Michael. We were all the same age, except for Michael, who was 10.

The four of us went down a gravel trail in the park near our neighborhood. We usually would go off the trail and into the woods to play hide-and-seek. We weren’t even that far in when the smell hit us. I would be assaulted with a similar rank smell years later when I found a dead cat baking on the road in the middle of August.

“Jesus, what is that?” Eddie said, pinching his nose.
