Ive had this nightmare since i was 7, i'm not 21.

Back when i was 7 i guess you could say i went through some traumatic experiences in life, a father who never wanted me, who abused alcohol and drugs, who would punch holes into doors to reach me, a father who tried to kill me. saying that though i guess you could say i survived and live everyday like any other person.

Growing up my household had 3 men who were considered father like figures, 2 being assholes and 1 died. Going through this i think my mind clung onto aspects of them and created a nightmare that i still to this day have. Its like a parasite that's merged my happiest dream with my worst nightmare.

To give the last bit of backstory my happiest dream of mine growing up was me and my whole family all moving into a house together and finally being able to see each other, the house was massive it had 3 floors and a basement, each room with its own walk in wardrobe and on suite. Its what id consider an out of reach luxury home.

As i said this thing merged my dream and created a nightmare, The nightmare starts with me and my whole family, which at the time there was 7 of us moving into this huge mansion type home, the reason we got a house so big was because my aunt and uncle were planning on kids and my mother is still young so the possibility was always there especially after meeting her new partner. You could never really tell how many rooms there were in this house as it was so big and would require a mass amount of time to get from Point A to Point B. 

This house was amazing and for the most part there wasn't many problems besides it being on top of a hill, the nearest town was about 20 minutes by car but with there being so many of us this wasn't an issue as everyone chipped into buying food and paying bills. Though cos of my age i really didn't care, i was happy enough making little dens out of pillows or exploring the area around the house, not that there was much around besides a small waterfall and a pond. 

Only after having this "dream" over and over did i really start to notice how little things changed, which for me was amazing as change is something i cannot stand, so going back to my "dream" and having my forts stay there and nothing happening when i was conscious so i didn't miss out on anything was a delight.

After a year or so did i notice that this wasn't normal, most kids didn't dream the same dream over and over, which i was fine with cos i never told anyone about it. During this time the dream did change and it added someone, but i couldn't make out who they were, it seemed more like a shadow i guess. I late found out my aunt was pregnant for the first time and was having a boy, after he arrived 9 months later the dream changed again the shadowy figure had morphed into my newly born cousin.

The house adapted to his existence and one of the rooms had transformed into a nursery. His room was above mine so i was always annoyed to hear him crying all the time, i don't like kids. 

Fast forwarding a few years of this dream and me figuring out who i was and having another new cousin my "dream" added 2 new people, my youngest cousin who is female and a guy i started talking to at the time on snapchat, this was absolutely weird its now added someone i've never met and yet it had their voice their exact attitude even the same height they had stated to me on a message.

During this time i'm now in high school and figuring out my sexuality whilst being bullied immensely, my mum's partner was on the rocks and was acting weird.

The "Dream" had adapted so much to everyone in my family over the years it started to feel real in aspects, id feel like i've had conversations with them but remember that it was in the dream and not reality. The house started to change and this is where my "Happiest Dream" becomes a nightmare.

The house always displayed itself as perfect, the wallpaper had no scratches the light bulbs never exploded or went out, the paint never chipped and the wood was always at tip shape. So you can imagine how weird it was to see that there was cobwebs on walls and that some parts of the wall paper started to scratch. i blew it off remembering this house was quite old and that i hadn't really seen anyone clean before so it skipped my mind for the time being.

Waking up one morning in the dream id noticed no one was awake but my aunt, she was confused as to where my eldest cousins room had went, at first i laughed because rooms don't just vanish, but she was pale and scared and insisted i go upstairs and look. His room was above mine so finding it was easy as it should be on the right side of the stairs. i proceed to walk up the flight of stairs to witness his room did actually move and the room was empty, not a trace of him at all, like he'd vanished into the dusty air that laid their in place of his room. i ran downstairs to my aunt but she had gone, i assume she must have gone looking for him. to my horrifying surprise and an absolute jump scare turned to see my cousin walking upstairs from the basement. i have never scream so loud for anyone before like i had screamed my aunties name when i saw him. She ran down every step we had and lunged at him for the biggest hug ever.

I woke up, and had slight shivers cos that was not like my "dream" its never moved a room, especially from the second floor to the basement, it was weird.

Falling asleep again and waking up in the dream from where i was last standing the living room had changed, its like someone rotated it, the ceiling was the floor and floor the ceiling, this isn't making any sense, how is this happening, i know this is a "dream" but why is it feeling so real. i walked around to notice not only had the living room changed but certain bedrooms were on the wrong floor or the wallpaper had changed pattern and color.

After dealing with this for a few nights i blew it off maybe finally my "dream is acing like just that a dream. its not supposed to be normal your not supposed to live a second life in your mind. Its only now did i notice something was not friendly, the dream had removed the guy i was talking to from existence just like a real life block, which happened. And when sitting with everyone in the living room that finally rotated back to normal i saw my grand dad walking in but not with my Nan, there was a person she had the same features but the face was not hers it was like a bad Photoshop image where the head doesn't match the body.

i was more than confused she had the same voice, the same features but not the same face, this one absolutely freaked me out, she tried talking to me like she knew me but i was so majorly confused to what the hell was going on. again i blow over this "its just a dream things can happen" and if its like the living room then it should go back to normal.

Ye wishful thinking this was. Another year has passed and more people come and go from the dream, more rooms change places and the floor boards now creaked. All these changes and yet another persons face was attached to my Nan, i've avoided her when i saw her its too weird to handle, why change everything but not her. 

Then over night the same had happened to my uncle, i swear these "dream" versions of us cant tell the difference but me and my mother knew that this was going on, we didn't discuss it i saw her reaction to the change, maybe we are the only ones that noticed.

Like i said before the Nightmare takes traits of my family from the real world and adapts to it in its own world. So when my mum's partner at the times behavior was odd, the nightmare version became the same. In NM (NightMare) id catch him leaving the basement or leaving the house at random. And in Real World he'd leave the house and not talk to me properly. Maybe the Nightmare was trying to slowly change where it was going to remove him. But i wasn't sure, its been a few years of these dreams altogether and my family faces have almost all become not their own. Mine, My Mothers, My Aunt and Youngest Cousin are the same but everyone else had changed.

The house was no different, paint cracked, wooden floor rotting and creaking more and more, Missing bricks on the walls, lights flickering yet no one has noticed, i had to slapped a plate from my cousins hands because he didn't realize the food was rotten and had maggots. This place used to be my happy home, Somewhere id go to escape now i cant wait to escape from it. Every time i sleep i am hoping that i wake up faster than the time before.

The next time i awoke into NM i noticed frantic screams from my mother, her sister and my cousin. Everyone who's face had changed so did they, they were no longer our family, yes their features were the same but their voice now different and so was their mind, they eyes now dripping with blood and now visible marks from where it looked like their old face was cut off with a blade and a new one sown on. 

The next time i entered NM i noticed now that only my mother and i were the last ones left, i could not bare the thought of my mum not being herself that was on of my nightmares, being forgotten about or disappearing. This Bastard Nightmare was going for gold and turning dreams into nightmares and inviting other nightmares over. Its completely taken over any unconscious thought i cant dream or have a separate nightmare anymore. 

Unfortunately for me after me and mum found a place to hide in the attic in what i thought to be a box that was for a wardrobe i awake from the nightmare, i was drowned in guilt for leaving her there alone even though she is not my real mother. i laid in bed with my eyes closed for what felt like hours in hope of sleeping, and i did i slept. But this time no nightmare, no dream, no nothing. 

It took Days until i found myself back in the hell hole that was my mind, that was the nightmare and when my eyes opened the box was beyond damaged and i found myself on the floor covered in blood.

i heart sank at the thought of leaving my own mum their to die, but as that very thought came a screech came from elsewhere in the house. Trying to find where though was the problem, the house had aged decades in days there was rooms missing, chunks of the house gone, floorboards rotten so badly a single ounce of pressure would snap them, paint scraped so badly it looks like someone clawed through it. Again another screech echoed from the floor below so now i know where its coming from, The Basement. Through all of this i hadn't even seen a single person that once lived here. Odd but i didn't care i needed to find who or what was screeching. as i entered the basement i could see how much it drastically changed from the time it was empty and traded places with my cousins room to now being covered with racks, boxes bottles and rotten food. though i only managed to see this under the dimly light room i turn the light on to see my mother clamped onto an old fashioned kitchen table with her partner over her with a blade at hand.

I finally now know who was causing all this mayhem and pain, but still confused to where everyone else had vanished to. I ran over to help my mother, as each leg and arm was clamped to a table leg, as i approached the area i saw that he was back i ran at the table trying to launch myself at it as the unit was so old the legs would snap easily, i managed to break 2 before being struck on the back of my head. As i awoke i was being kicked in the chest and punched all over my body, he was going to kill me there and then, and in those moments i contemplated if i were to die in the nightmare would it all end, would i finally wake up and never have to  dream this god awful crap again.

As this was happening my mother manged to create enough movement to cause the other 2 legs of the kitchen unit to break thus freeing her from his clutch, she approached the mad man and kicked him and beat him. She flung my arm over her shoulder and we ran out of the basement. finally able to catch our breath. We heard a roar followed by heavy foot steps coming toward us at a fast pace. We couldn't leave the house as it adapted again and all doors and windows were boarded up. I think for a brief moment we both gave up, we stood there together ready for our fate, this place had no rules and we couldn't control the environment unlike someone or something that wanted us dead. What was merely a few seconds felt like minutes was we saw the mad one emerge from the dark basement corridor we froze still in our spots waiting.

As he took a few step onto the rotten boards he fell through them, into an uncharted room hidden in the basement and was pierced by a slab of wood through the bottom of his jaw piercing outwards from his mouth. 

It was finally over we thought, walking back into the basement to notice what had finally happened to our beloved family, in each jar was a singular body part that belonged to our family members. countless amount of them, they were not there before, the entity that must be controlling the narrative must have put them there as a final laugh at us in torment. 

It was like a dream leaving that nightmare, finally free from seeing everyone dead and living through horror in my sleep. Sadly for me i was wrong, i was so wrong since then i've relived all of that in one night over and over for a few months, living years of nightmares in a single night and each time being different, the first person who's face was bladed off being different than the last and the order being completely different, even how me and my mum survive being different and how the mad man dies being different. 

It all stopped after i grew used to it, became emotionless in my nightmare and no longer fathomed by it all. It all Finally stopped. It stopped right after my mum and her partner had split up in real life, they magically went. 

Since then they do reappear every couple months but it never fully plays out, it ends before i get to see who causes all the pain and hurt, its even added my mum's new partner and 3 kids to the story but they all end up face swapped but still never see who's behind it all.

They started again on my 18th after i met this man who turned to be my partner of 3 years and now sadly hes in the nightmare.

Its been 3 years since anything has changed in the NM no-one new added nothing, i can now dream and have separate nightmares without living through this experience.

But i'm still curious to who's the one doing the bad now, ill update you all if and when anything happens.

Thx for reading this absolute torture i've been going through, this isn't a made up story my nightmares are real and have been reoccurring for years. i'm just happy they have slowed down.
