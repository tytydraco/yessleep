"Show me the chat."

"Why? What happened?"

"That wasn't me! Show me the chat now!!"

I opened the chat on my pone and gave it to him. He scanned through the chat, slowly, as if he was afraid of something he could find here. He finally reached the end of the conversation. He stared at the screen but his eyes didn't move. It seemed as if he was trying to convince himself he was hallucinating. Finally, he closed the chat and returned my phone,

"Shit.... Shit.... Shit... Why now? I've only seen him twice. Why now?"

"What's going on? What the hell are you talking about?"

"You replied to the message...And by doing that you let the 5th creature in. This is how it's been trying to find me. It keeps calling me and talking about his dog, asking me if I have dog food.... It's the only reason I've been able to avoid him for so long. If I didn't know, I'd be dead by now."

"What does this have to do with your dog?"

"NOTHING! I DON'T HAVE A DOG FOR FUCKS SAKE. It's how the creature knows where I am. It.... Hopefully you don't find out."

The doorbell rang. I immediately reached for my phone to check the footage. As soon as Kevin saw this, he slapped it out of my hand. I picked it up immediately.

"You don't want to see that. Trust me. You NEVER want to see that thing."

He grabbed me by the arm and began dragging me towards the stairs.

"What the hell are you doing?"

"It's coming. It's at your gate and it's going to enter."

The doorbell kept ringing as he dragged me up the stairs. I opened the footage but didn't get a chance to check it as Kevin continued to drag me.

He finally reached the 3rd floor, practically threw me across the hallway and pushed me in a guest room.

"Listen to me, lock all of the doors and windows on this floor. Cover every transparent surface you can find, and return to this room. We'll be safe for a while in here."

"Me?? This is your problem! Thar creature wants to find you! You can't just force me to do this!"

"The second I walk up to a window, it will see me and kill me. It's not targeting you in the first place so you have a far greater chance of survival."

"What? I don't-"

"JUST DO IT FOR FUCKS SAKE!! DO YOU WANT TO DIE??"

He pushed me out of the room and closed the door.

"LET ME BACK IN!!!"

No answer came. It was hopeless.

I started with the second guest room. Locking and covering the window before locking the door. I did the same with the bathroom.

The doorbell had stopped ringing, so I took the liberty of checking the cameras. The were unusually blurry. Not pixelated, just far lower quality than they should have been. The resolution as high enough for me to make out to figures at the gate. They were both short. Neither above 170 cms in height, but one of them wasn't human. It clearly wasn't upright, resembling a bull with some foxlike characteristics. The humanoid ones arm moved and the doorbell rang once again, snapping me out of my fascination with the two figures.

I approached my bedroom and entered, scanning the space to make sure no one was inside. As much as I just wanted to stay here and let Kevin die to whatever the fuck was outside, I locked and covered the windows, left and locked the door. The guest room didn't have windows, so perhaps I'd be safer in there. I approached the door and attempted to open it.

It was locked. The fucker locked me out.

"Kevin? I locked the doors. Now let me back in."

Silence

"KEVIN!! Are you still alive?

"Yes."

"Then unlock the door and let me in."

"No. I'll be safe here. Maybe they'll find you out there and the curse will transfer to you."

"What do you mean? They're trying to kill YOU."

"It's worked before. In a way, the fact that the fifth one happened to be the one to arrive is an opportunity..."

"Before? You've tried this before?"

"Five times. I've transferred five creatures to five people and now there's only three left. With your death, it will be two and I plan to make it zero by the end of this week. I'm sorry. I don't want to do this, but I've had to suffer for so long you're expendable."

The doorbell stopped ringing. I checked the footage to see the two figures approaching the building.

They got through the gate.

"KEVIN!!! KEVIN, LET ME IN!!! THEY GOT THROUGH THE GATE!!"

No answer.

The doorbell started ringing again.

"KevinnnnnNNN!!! Please, I know you can hear me. Let me in NOW!"

I gave up and unlocked the door to my bedroom before sprinting into the bathroom and locking the door behind me. There were no windows here either. Perhaps this would be effective enough.

Now that I was finally safe (to the greatest extent I could be at this point) I checked he footage once again. I only saw one figure this time. The humanoid one. It approached he second camera at an uncomfortably high speed. I stared at it, slightly nauseous at this point, attempting to make out its facial features. The camera had returned to it's former quality allowing me to make them out. The most prominent one was the appendage jutting from the left side of its head. Lines overed it's face most begining from the appendage, while some crossed over its eyes. It's mouth appeared human enough but uncomfortably large. These features grew more and more disturbing as it approached the camera.

Then it spoke

"Kvnryuwtchnths??"

Or something along those lines. Its voice was deep, slightly distorted even.

"YDNTHVTKVN thdgwllfndy."

I couldn't tell if it was a male or female.

It was staring right at me.

"Kvnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!"

It took me a moment to realize it wasn't speaking to me. It was staring at a window exactly were the guest room Kevin was in should have been located.

"Kvnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!"

But the guest room didn't have any windows. What was this thing looking at? The attic?

"THATTCLDSTTHGSTRM!!!! DG!!!"

The attic led to the guest room... And had windows.

I ran out of the bathroom, practically breaking down the bedrooms door and approached the guest room.

"KEVINN!!! KEVIN!! OPEN THE DOOR!! IT'S IN THERE WITH YOU! THE ATTIC LEADS TO THE GUEST ROOM!"

I heard the door unlock and Kevin sprinted out of the room.

"What the fuck? There's something in the attic? Why didn't you tell me it led to the guest room?"

"I forgot the attic had two entrances. I assumed the g-"

A crash interrupted. The entrance to the attic rolled out the door as the second creature tackled Kevin. I didn’t have time to look a it's features. I ran into the guest room and locked the door.

Kevin began to scream as the creature attempted to bit him. I could hear it's teeth close around one of his limbs. He screamed once again.

"HELP!!! LET ME BACK IN!!!"

"You narcissist! You think I'm going to let you back in here after you locked me out? I was going to help you, but you DESERVE death now!"

"Please! I only had to do this two more times. Two more sacrifices and I wouldn't need to suffer! PLEASE!!"

He continued to scream as the creature bit him once again. He kept screaming as he tried to push the creature away from him.

"Please!! PLEASE!!! I'VE WAITED FOR SO LONG! I DON'T WANT TO DIE LIKE THIS!!!"

His voice became far less audible. He was weak. Perhaps he had begun to bleed out. I let him. I let him continue to scream and heave as the creature gorged itself upon him. He somehow summoned enough energy to crawl to the door, clawing at the wood.

"Please.... Why do I need to... Di....E....."

Silence.

Pure silence.

He was dead and creature was finally gone. Finally.

I opened the door. Nothing. No blood, no fingerprints or any proof anyone had been in my home that night. I checked outside. Nothing. No one was out there. I walked over to my bedroom to unlock the door, only to find I didn't need to. It was unlocked already. I reached for my phone, but it wasn't in my pocket.

A light beep emanated from my bedroom. It was my phone. Resting on my desk. In the exact place where Kevin had contacted me. I picked it up and checked the text.

"Hi, it's Kevin. I know you're probably wondering what happened to me, but I'm fine. Just like the rest of the creatures, I've been transferred to someone. I hope you enjoyed our encounter. Have fun with the new one. That thing is... You’ll see. I'm sure it won't be too hard. I doubt you'll live long. Take care, mate! And thanks for this opportunity,”

[Soo... Any chance I could stay out your house for... A day, perhaps? There are some issues with my living arrangements.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoodenPikes/)
