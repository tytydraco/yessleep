I just moved to a new city, hours away from home, to start college. My school makes all out-of-state freshmen live in the dorms for their first year, and since I’ve always been an introvert, I chose a single room. I ended up on the bottom floor of some old, run-down building that looks straight out of a horror movie.

Being a broke college kid, I started working as a Grubhub driver. My university has a partnership with them, so I figured there’d be plenty of orders to keep me busy. The first few weeks were fine, picking up from fast food joints, meeting the usual late-night workers, and delivering whatever unholy combinations a drunk college kid could dream up. It wasn’t great money, but it was enough to keep me fed and mildly buzzed.

Lately, though, things have gotten... strange.

It popped up one night out of nowhere. A mom-and-pop butcher shop I’d never noticed before, just outside town called “Fresh Meats”. The logo looked old-fashioned, like it hadn’t been updated since the ‘70s, and the prices were ridiculous. Fifty-eight dollars for a cheeseburger. Sixty-two for something called the “House Special.” I figured it was some high-end farm-to-table thing, or maybe just a glitch. But it was close by, so I accepted.

The drive there was weirdly long for being “five miles away.” The roads felt unfamiliar, even though I’ve lived here for a month and thought I knew every turn by now. The streetlights thinned out until it was just my headlights and the glow of my phone screen. When I finally pulled up, I almost drove past the place, the sign was half burned out, just the letters “*E A T”*  flickering in red.

The shop itself looked abandoned. The windows were blacked out, and there was a single unplugged chest freezer sitting outside by the door with a note taped to it:

“For Delivery Pickup — Enter Code.”

When I opened the app, the customer had already sent me a four-digit code. I entered it on the small keypad by the freezer and heard a click. Inside was a paper bag, heavy and warm, sealed with masking tape. No receipt, no name, just “ORDER #0000” scrawled in sharpie on the bag. The smell wasn’t bad, not quite rotten, but metallic, like the air after a nosebleed.

I looked for a doorbell, a buzzer, anyone inside, nothing. Just silence and that faint hum from somewhere deep inside the building, like machinery running behind the walls.

I made the delivery to an apartment complex near campus. The guy was waiting outside, hands in his pockets, no coat despite the cold. He took the bag without saying a word, turned, and walked inside. The app pinged a second later, $40 tip.

Forty. Dollars.

That’s more than I make all night most shifts.

I told myself it had to be a mistake. But the money stayed in my balance, so I didn’t question it.

The next night, another Fresh Meats order popped up. Same setup — weird code, freezer pickup, silent drop-off. Another big tip. This time it was $55. Enough to fill my tank and buy groceries for the week. I started telling myself that maybe this was just how the place did business, some secret rich-person butcher shop with paranoid customers.

But there’s something off about it. The drive feels shorter every time, like the roads are folding in on themselves. The building looks… shifted. I swear the freezer was on the other side of the door last time. And when I check my order history afterward, the deliveries don’t show up, no record of Fresh Meats, no order numbers.

I’ve delivered for them five times now. It’s always the same: code, bag, silent pickup. No workers. No other drivers. No addresses I recognize.

I asked around at a few restaurants, and no one’s ever heard of the place.  
When I tried to bring it up to one of my regulars, a grad student who orders takeout every Tuesday and Thursday, he just froze and said, *“Don’t talk about that place.”* Then he shut the door.

I can’t stop thinking about that smell. It’s faint, but I swear it’s in my car now, even when I haven’t driven all day.

What’s weirder is that no one else seems to get these orders. The app only sends them to me. I’ve tried going offline when one pops up, but somehow, when I reopen the app, it’s still there waiting, like it never left.

Last night another one came through. I hesitated, I really did, but the base pay was forty bucks before tips. That’s half a textbook. Half a week’s groceries.

I know I shouldn’t, but I can’t afford not to.

The smell’s been clinging to everything lately. Even after cleaning my car, it lingers, that metallic tang, like the air after someone bleeds.

I’ll update again later this week. I’ve got midterms to study for, but something about this place feels wrong. Every time I think about skipping the next order, I get this feeling. Like someone’s waiting for me to show up.

If anyone’s heard of Fresh Meats or knows why these orders don’t show up in my history, please tell me.
