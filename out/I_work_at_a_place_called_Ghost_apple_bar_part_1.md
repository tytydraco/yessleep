Near the bar area of ​​my city you can find a corridor hidden between the buildings that will take you to an area not very well known to the public, an apparently innocent patio of light, on the north wall of this "bubble" within The block is where I work, the only place in this place if you don't count the vending machines outside.

An old bar, with an emphasis on “old”, it is not a very big bar, we have capacity for only 13 people, not many people visit us and only 2 people work here, Rocco and me.

I prepare the drinks and serve the customers while Rocco prepares the appetizers, yes, we sell appetizers, from simple bar peanuts to calamari fritti in the purest Italian style, but in this place we have special rules for customers, one of them is that, if Rocco knows how to prepare a dish that is not on the menu, we prepare the dish for the customer and mark it as a "special dish".

I like to say that we are a dynamic duo, although I can rarely see his face beyond the window that leads to the kitchen, besides that Rocco is not very talkative, or rather, he does not speak at all.

But that doesn't matter, this bar is a very pathetic one, old bottles decorate the place next to dark wooden walls and a slight smell of cigarettes (which is weird because I don't let anyone smoke inside the bar), a full pool table dust in the center of the place is the only means of entertainment for customers along with our old radio and television, and to finish the tour, a bathroom, where I'm sure more than one person died of overdose.

It's all you can see in this place, not for nothing we don't have many clients, of course, that and our "style" does not combine well with our hours or location.

We are so hidden that only interesting people visit us, I could tell you about the old woman who always tries to sell us ground meat of dubious quality, how we always run out of turnips, although we never serve them, about the empty bathroom that screams incoherently, or maybe want to hear something else get excited.

Like that time the bar filled up with a bunch of people who I'm sure were part of some weird cult, which is weird, we never have that many customers, or that other time when a couple had a pretty violent fight, they left. and within minutes they returned unharmed, they repeated the fight over and over again all night, I sold a lot of wine that night.

But those stories are for another day or to be forgotten over a drink.

Our shift is from 10 at night to 6 in the morning, so I don't have much free time at night, I sleep almost all day and at this point you could say that my best friends are: Rocco, the chair that I have behind the bar and our radio, since the damn television turns itself on and off, I have tried to unplug it, but I still can't find the power cord.

This place is strange and boring most of the nights, that's why I'm starting this diary, lacking things to do, I just have to record my days working in this bar, either that or try to guess who is living on the walls, or trying to guess what the vending machines outside say, I think they are written in Chinese or something, it's not like I can see my phone, there's almost no signal here, we don't have internet and our only means of communication It's a telephone.

If you manage to find this place and make the decision to enter this bar, you will always see me there, standing at the bar waiting for customers, with a bored look lost in my thoughts, you will be able to see Rocco's torso leaning out of the kitchen window, almost always with a cookbook in his hands, I don't know if it's an admirable work ethic or he's just as bored as I am.

But anyway, I spend every day, Tuesday to Sunday, working from 10 to 6, in this place, I'm the weird guy who makes the drinks and takes the orders, everyone calls me “Peter”, even if that's not my name, if you arrive at my bar and you are the first to show this post I will buy you a drink, it is not easy to find us if you do not know the area, but if one day you enter a corridor and at the end you see a bar with the neon sign that says "Ghost Apple", congratulations, you've arrived at the worst bar in town, where a loser and a giant will serve you tonight!
