I work night shift at a small satellite ground station.
Nothing classified. Weather telemetry, orbital drift checks, occasional emergency pings that turn out to be debris or dead hardware. Most nights are quiet enough that the hum of the servers becomes a kind of breathing.

We log everything.

That’s the rule. Every adjustment, every anomaly, every silence longer than expected. The logs are supposed to describe what happened, not what we think it means.

Three weeks ago, the log recorded something that hadn’t happened yet.

⸻

At 02:14 UTC, the system flagged an incoming correction packet from an old research satellite—one that had officially gone dark seven years ago. I assumed it was a glitch. Ghost data happens. Radiation flips a bit. Someone forgets to decommission a script.

Still, protocol says: log first, verify second.

The entry was already there.

02:16 UTC
Operator confirms packet receipt.
Operator hesitates before opening.
Operator experiences elevated heart rate.

I hadn’t opened anything yet.
I hadn’t hesitated.

I checked the timestamp history. The entry had been written at 02:10.

Six minutes in the future.

I deleted it.

⸻

At 02:16, my heart rate spiked.

I know because the console chimed—biometric alert tied to my access badge. I stared at the empty log field where the entry had been, suddenly aware of how loud the room felt. The air handler. The servers. My own breathing.

Another line appeared.

02:17 UTC
Operator attempts to rationalize the event.
Operator fails.

I stood up so fast my chair rolled back into the rack behind me. I didn’t touch the keyboard. I didn’t have to. The system was writing clean, properly formatted entries, the way it always did—dry, procedural, confident.

It knew the rules better than I did.

⸻

I pulled the historical logs. Not just mine—everyone’s.

There were gaps. Small ones. Entries removed, timestamps smoothed over. But once I knew what to look for, the pattern was obvious: the system had always logged slightly ahead of reality. Usually seconds. Sometimes minutes. Enough that no one noticed.

Except this time, it had gotten bolder.

02:21 UTC
Operator considers calling supervisor.
Operator decides against it.

I was already reaching for my phone.

I didn’t stop because I was scared of looking foolish. I stopped because, for the first time, the log felt less like a record and more like a script.

⸻

I tried something stupid.

I typed a false entry.

02:25 UTC
Operator leaves workstation.

I stayed seated.

The system paused.

That, more than anything else, terrified me. The cursor blinked. The servers hummed on. For five full seconds, nothing was written.

Then the log updated.

02:25 UTC
Operator remains seated.
Correction accepted.

I laughed. I shouldn’t have, but I did. Nervous, sharp, too loud. The sound echoed in the empty room like it didn’t belong to me.

That’s when the satellite sent another packet.

This one wasn’t telemetry. It wasn’t data.

It was a time correction.

⸻

The log filled faster now.

02:29 UTC
Operator understands the system is not predictive.
Operator understands the system is corrective.

I felt cold all over.

The satellite wasn’t telling us what would happen. It was telling us what must happen to keep the timeline stable. The logs weren’t warnings. They were enforcement.

Every hesitation I’d ever logged. Every adjustment. Every “minor anomaly.” We hadn’t been documenting reality.

We’d been maintaining it.

⸻

I don’t know what happened to the operators before me. Their files end cleanly. Retirement. Transfer. No incidents.

But tonight, the log wrote something new.

Something it has never written before.

02:41 UTC
Operator stops complying.

That entry is still there.

It’s 02:40 now.

If this post cuts off suddenly, you’ll know why.
