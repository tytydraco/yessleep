I didn’t write a note. I didn’t text anyone. It’s not like anyone would’ve read it anyway.

Three days ago, I decided that this week would be the week. Knowing that gave me a strange sense of peace—of closure. I felt genuinely free, like my life finally had some kind of purpose again. Not just wasting away on the couch or clocking in at a job that contributed nothing to the world.

I went to the pharmacy and bought two bottles of ibuprofen. They sat there on my nightstand. Every morning when I woke up, they were the first thing I saw. I’d just sit there, silently fantasizing about an overdose. About finally... ending things.

April 3rd. 1:30 a.m.

I turned off my phone, sat on the couch, and placed a glass of water on the coffee table in front of me. I opened one of the bottles and pulled out the little wad of cotton inside. For a second, I considered just dumping the whole thing into my mouth like candy—but I didn’t want to choke. I didn’t want to gasp for air and die convulsing on the floor. I wanted a quiet death.

I took a handful—ten pills or so—and downed them.  
First handful: no problem.  
Second: same.  
I gagged about halfway through the bottle, but after a minute of sitting still, I was back at it.  
Pouring. Drinking. Swallowing.  
Over and over, until both bottles were empty.

And then... a wave of euphoria.

People always say death is terrifying. But to me? It was freeing. It was like something heavy had been lifted off my shoulders. Like for once, I could breathe.

About twenty-five minutes later, the side effects kicked in. My head started spinning. Nausea twisted in my gut. My mouth dried out, my lips cracking. The headache hit next—sharp, pounding.

It wasn’t pleasant. But I didn’t fight it. I welcomed it. The pain now was worth the peace I believed was coming.

But it didn’t come.

I remembered reading it would take 45 minutes to die. But I was still here. And worse—my body felt heavy. My limbs were like cement blocks. I couldn’t move.

I glanced at the clock.

**3:37 a.m.**  
I should’ve been gone by now.

Then it hit me:  
Was this death?  
Was I just stuck here… with my thoughts… forever?

Panic set in. Real, soul-crushing panic.  
I thought about something I’d heard once—**White Room Torture**.  
A kind of psychological punishment where you’re locked in total isolation. No sights, no sounds, no time, no touch. All your senses—gone.

It felt like that.  
Minutes passed. Then hours. Then... days.  
Still, I stared at the clock.  
**3:37 a.m.**  
It never changed.

Please believe me when I say this—I sat there for what felt like **weeks**. Alone. Completely and utterly alone. No peace. No relief. Just panic. Dread.

Time crawled. Seconds stretched out. My mind… started breaking.  
I cycled through every thought I’ve ever had.  
School lessons. Childhood memories. The same damn three songs stuck in my head. The same colors, looping over and over again.

And the clock.  
**3:37 a.m.**

Then, after what felt like **forever**, I heard something.

Not a sound, exactly. More like… a voice. Mechanical. Cold. It said just two words:

**“752 days.”**

That was it.

Confusion smacked me in the face.  
“Seven hundred fifty-two days?” What the hell does that mean?

Then—silence again.

No explanation. No noise. No sense of time. Just that message, echoing in my skull.

**752 days.**

I looked back at the clock.  
Still **3:37 a.m.**

My thoughts fell apart. Nothing made sense anymore. Words blurred. Memories twisted. Just a constant, buzzing mess of static and voices in my head.

Then, it all stopped.

No transition. No warning. Just... stillness.

I opened my eyes.

Fluorescent lights.  
The soft beep of a heart monitor.

I was in a hospital.

Why?  
How?

Didn’t I die?

The nurse said they found me unconscious on my couch. They pumped my stomach. I’d been in a coma.

For **752 days**.
