I still remember the night I broke up with my ex. It was a fight that escalated into her calling the cops, and a rather confusing interrogation afterwards. I was just glad I wasn’t going to jail. Not long after, she moved out and I blocked her on Instagram, TikTok and Facebook.

After a few months, I had found a girl on an online game. We bonded very well and eventually we began dating in real life. Her name was Rose, and she was a year younger than me.  She had the prettiest curly blonde hair, and unlike my ex, I could tell she genuinely loved me. She laughed at my bad jokes, and she even made up a love song for me (that’s how I learned she was an aspiring indie musician)! The only bad thing about Rose was that sometimes she would get upset and leave unexpectedly. When that happened I half expected her to commit suicide. But she never left for more than five hours before coming back and crying into my chest. I can’t comfort people well, but being with her was good enough therapy for us.

Not long after we started dating though, my ex came back with a vengeance. Everywhere I went, I saw her face. Those cold, snarky dark green eyes. The long, thick, purple hair that faded to a poorly bleached brown. No matter where I went, she was there. Almost as if she was stalking me. Or she was cloning herself to stalk me, but that seemed far fetched. Eventually, I’d reached a breaking point, and openly told her in public to “leave me alone”. She just snickered and laughed.
 “You better keep your eyes on your new girl, I know who she is.” she chuckled. 
After the warning, I immediately sped home, seeing a few repeats of my damned ex’s face, some in large gatherings. I even had to pull over and stop myself to take a second look at the large gathering of copies of my ex. How the hell did she do this, was my mind playing tricks on me? There were hundreds of her, and after they targeted Rose, who knows who else they’d target? Me?

I went home and immediately checked on Rose in my apartment, a shrill cry coming from her. I followed the cries and what would you expect, Poor Rose surrounded by three clones of my ex like something out of the Matrix.

And just like Agent Smith in the Matrix transforming others into his clones, I could see changes starting to happen on her body. Hair slowly straightened, her voice became a little deeper and more sultry, but those fearful blue eyes were focused on me. 

The muffled cries broke my heart, and I attempted to force her off of Rose and ran away with her. But it was too late, Rose had already taken on my ex girlfriend’s bitchy personality, and soon only god knew what would happen.

Despite the banging on the door, I locked myself in a different room of the apartment, where I prayed she wouldn’t find me. But that’s when I saw a more feminine face and a pair of green eyes in the mirror, and I doubled over in pain as my chest started to pulse and swell…

Please, avoid a sexy girl with faded purple hair who calls herself Bailey! I need to go, my mind is starting to fog…
