I was sitting in my room playing a game on my phone when it happened. I received a notification announcing I'd won a brand new VR headset. I’d heard rumors around school of other students who’d received a similar offer, but never expected to get one myself.

No one had received a headset yet, but I filled out the shipping details and approved the charge for $6.99 shipping and handling on my dad’s credit card. I had no idea of the consequences at the time.

When I returned from school this afternoon, a package was waiting for me on the front stoop. I ran to my room, leaving a trail of wrapping and cardboard in my wake. I sat there at my desk, dumbfounded, with the newly arrived SRU220 on the table before me for at least 20 minutes, just staring at it. I felt sure it would disappear if I dared to close my eyes.

This unimposing red and black headset was the new craze in the gaming world. Costing well into the thousands, if you could get your hands on one. I couldn’t believe I’d scored one for free.

I've always been skeptical of virtual reality. I never understood why people would want to immerse themselves in a fake world when there's so much beauty in the real one. That said, when I was given the chance to try out the newest VR headset on the market, I couldn't resist.

A small card accompanied the headset. 'READ ALOUD BEFORE PLAYING' was written across the top in bold red lettering. Must be one of those voice activation codes.

Turning the card over in my hand, there was only a short poem written on the reverse side.

IF I AM THEE

AND THEE IS WE

I INVITE YOU ALL

TO PLAY WITH ME

Shakespeare it was not, but I read it aloud with gusto.

As soon as I put on the headset, I was transported to another world. It was like nothing I had ever experienced before. I was surrounded by a sweeping landscape shrouded entirely in shadows; thunder rolled angrily in the distance. It was like something out of an old black and white movie. I'd been expecting something a touch more upbeat and colorful for my first venture into VR, but I wasn’t necessarily complaining either. Who doesn't love a good horror game?

Before I could give further thought to my surroundings, I heard a voice in my right ear. It was a soft voice, almost like a whisper.

'Hello.'

I turned around, but nobody was there. I shrugged it off, returning to inspect the scenery once more.

The voice came back, louder this time.

'Hello, can you hear me?'

I turned around again, this time I saw a figure illuminated by the sudden flashes of lighting overhead. It was a tall dark figure, almost like a shadow from the surrounding landscape, and it was wearing my clothes. I knew in that moment something was wrong. I tried to move, but I couldn't. I was frozen in place. I willed myself to remove the headset, but nothing happened.

The figure slowly approached me. My gaze settled on its eyes. They were dark and lifeless eyes. Like black holes they pierced directly into my soul and slowly began to draw the life out of me. It stopped just out of arms reach, a tooth-filled grin spreading slowly across its otherwise emotionless face. Creatures that I could only describe as nightmare-inducing began to crawl out of the shadow figure. They were hideous, tiny creatures, all legs and eyes crawling over one another in waves in their harried attempt to get me.

Despite my best efforts, I was unable to make a sound. I felt as if I was suffocating as panic ravaged my body. I was frozen in place. I could only watch as the creatures swarmed over me, tearing into my flesh with enthusiasm. The figure reached out with its long spider-like fingers, marking something on my forehead. An icy chill spread through my body before everything grew dark.

I woke up a short while ago. Back in the real world, I hope. The headset lying at my feet gives me hope this is real. I can still see those nasty creepy creatures lurking in the shadows of my bedroom. Watching me with their beady eyes. They're waiting for me to put on the headset again so they can finish what they started. I’m not sure how they got there, but I can hear them scratching at the walls from within.

I just caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror by the door. There's a symbol carved into my forehead, but I don't know what it means. It looks like a trio of circles intertwined, with an upside-down triangle weaving through them.

I know I have to destroy the headset; I can hear it calling me. It wants me to come back, or it says it will take my dad instead.

I don’t know what to do…
