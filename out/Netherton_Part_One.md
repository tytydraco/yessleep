Sometimes people remember the exact moment their lives changed, literally, forever. They can remember it down to the absolute minute and second. Like, 12:34:56, sometime after lunch on some such of a day. 
For others, like myself, I had a sense of the hour and only vaguely the minute. It was, or is, July 9th - 2025 - sometime after 5pm. For some, they were just going about their usual business, living in their own little worlds inside their heads, maybe standing at a photocopier machine making copies of expense reports and humming to themselves. I’m just driving in my little red jeep, smiling. 


I imagine it was sort of like my vague recollection for people on 9/11. I don’t mean they don’t remember just, at that exact second, they were probably just going about their business. Unawares something so significant was about to happen. If you’re above the age of 30, you probably remember people often asking;


“Where were you on 9/11?”


For me it was 12/9 and I was half a world away. It was like a pin black hole tying the times together, yet it was in reality, actually happening at the same time. I remember seeing it on the television.


It’s just past 5 o clock in the afternoon. It gets darker earlier this time of year, so the horizons a nice shade of pink and orange hues. On long drives I often zone out, I know it’s not ideal but I’m still conscious of what’s around me. I’m driving alone, no music.


I lied, maybe this is the exact second everything changed. To my left, a green and white sign welcoming me to Netherton catches my eye. I really must not have been paying attention at the last stop sign because this isn’t my usual stretch of road home. 


The road stays mostly straight, a single stretch with the occasional bend. About halfway through, a second road branches off and climbs a slight hill, but I stay on the main drag. The houses are strange, spaced out like no real town would allow. Some are barely visible behind hedges, like they’re hiding. I don’t see any people yet, and I don’t register the parked cars this time around. My brain’s chewing itself, trying to recall if Netherton is a place I’ve ever passed through before. It only takes five minutes before I’m staring at the welcome sign again.


A guy waves me down. Tall, mid-20s maybe. Beanie, plaid shirt, looks like a young Eddie Vedder pulled out of a Seattle poster. I slow, unsure, but he jogs to the passenger side and gets in before I can think. I flinch.


 “Hey,” he says, both hands up like he’s seen this go badly before. “Not gonna hurt you. Just protecting us from her.” He nods ahead. 


I follow his gaze. A blonde girl is sprinting toward us, makeup streaked, black tutu flaring around her. She’s screaming something, voice cracking. Leather jacket, wild eyes. 


“She usually doesn’t come too close.”


I’m starting to think I might have dozed off at the wheel. Maybe this is one of those hyper-real dreams, protecting my mind right before I hit a tree. The guy in the passenger seat watches me, reads something on my scared facial expression. 


“I’m the unofficial welcoming committee,” he says with a dry kind of calm. 


Outside, the girl’s still screaming. Her voice cracks, loops. “This isn’t real!” over and over like a scratched record. 


The man doesn’t flinch. Just turns to me, like we’re in line for coffee, and asks, “How many times did you pass the welcome sign?”


“Twice,” I say, my voice smaller than I expect. 


He nods like that confirms something. 


“Name’s Adam,” he offers.


I tell him mine. Anna. He says it back to me like he’s testing the sound of it. It feels like he’s trying to anchor me, ease the panic still crawling under my skin, despite the girl still screaming not thirty meters away.


“Take a look at that house,” he says, nodding right. It’s two storeys. Bottom in brick, top in weatherboard, windows that don’t match. “Now that one,” he adds, pointing left. One storey. Seventies. Half a fence. Three chimneys.


It looks to me like how houses might look if you’re trying to render them inside of a dream space. Have you ever had a dream where you’re trying to use your cellphone? It’s often not the model you usually use. You find you can’t navigate it properly or make a phone call for the life of you.


Dreaming is theorised to aid in memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and threat simulation. During REM sleep, the brain’s limbic system activates while the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex goes offline, producing surreal narratives from fragmented episodic memory and misfiring hippocampal indexing. What a hoot. 


I tell Adam I think I’m dreaming. He doesn’t laugh. Doesn’t even smile. He reaches over and pinches the inside of my lower arm. Not hard, just enough. I blink. My eyes feel dry. I’m suddenly aware that I need to pee. I can feel the pressure in my lower stomach, the faint ache in my hip from sitting too long. My mouth is dry but not unfamiliar. These are the usual tugs and pulls of being awake. Of being in a body. 


“That’s how you know,” he says. “Dreams don’t remember what your bladder feels like.” He’s probably right.


The girl’s screaming is getting under my skin. There’s a pressure behind my eyes now, a headache forming. I shout at her through the glass that I’m calling the cops, even though the windows are up and she can’t hear me. I pull my phone from my right pocket, pink case with the little scratch near the camera lens. No signal. Not even a flicker. Just ‘SOS only’ staring back at me. Adam glances at it. 


“Fanciest one I’ve seen yet,” he says. I don’t laugh. I don’t smile. Something’s wrong. Not dream-wrong. Not lost-wrong. A different kind of wrong.


I’m looking around now. Really looking. There’s a Buick with Virginia plates a little ways down, parked on the wrong side of the road. Past that, a Fiat with German plates, too clean, like its brand new. My breathing shortens. Skin feels too tight. Adam places a gentle hand on my shoulder, like he’s done it before. 


“Breathe deep,” he commands. The girl’s still screaming, shrill and unrelenting, like a fire alarm no one’s bothered to stop. 


“If you don’t shut her up,” I say, “I think I’m inclined to run her over.” Just then, as if hearing me, she turns.


Chronoception is the brain’s ability to perceive the passage of time. It’s not housed in a single structure, but spread across neural networks - the suprachiasmatic nucleus, basal ganglia, even the insular cortex. Our sense of duration is fragile, warped by attention, emotion, and memory consolidation. Anxiety speeds it up. Boredom slows it down. Trauma splits it open. I don’t remember when Adam got in the car or when I stopped feeling scared. Just now I check my phone. Battery’s at 73 percent. Time reads 6:12 PM. Somehow, an hour has passed since I saw the sign. It felt like fifteen minutes.


Adam opens the door and steps out casually, like we’re parked outside a diner. 


“Shall we go find out what house this place has chosen for you?” he asks, like it’s the most natural thing in the world. 


I follow. He feels safe in a way I can’t explain, like something I decided without realizing. We start at the mismatched townhouse to the right. Inside smells like dust and old lemons. Adam takes the stairs two at a time. 


“Up here,” he calls. I find him in the first bedroom on the left, standing before a wardrobe. Inside are my clothes.


I just stand there, staring at a hoodie I know for a fact is back home in my bedroom. Adam doesn’t seem surprised. 


“Mines the one with the chimneys,” he says casually, nodding toward the street. “Right by the town hall.” 


I finally manage to speak. “What the fuck is going on?”


He exhales through his nose, then says, “It’s better if I explain it in parts. Too much at once and you might crack.” There’s something about the way he says it that makes me believe he’s seen it happen.


In my early twenties I went to a public neuroscience lecture about quantum teleportation. I barely understood a word of it but I went to impress someone and I think all twenty year olds try to seem smarter than they are. The speaker described a theoretical process of disassembling atomic structure, transmitting it across space, and reassembling it in perfect order. Matter, not just information. The laws of physics stretched but not broken. I remember sitting there, hungover and half asleep, thinking it sounded like science fiction. But now I am staring at my hoodie and wondering if it’s not.


The Ouzel Galley set sail from Dublin in 1695, bound for the Ottoman Empire. When it failed to return within its expected timeframe, ship and crew were declared lost. Yet five years later, the vessel sailed back into Dublin Bay, apparently unharmed. The crew, in good health, claimed it was still 1695 and believed only months had passed. Their logs stopped abruptly, offering no clue as to the missing years. The ship’s sudden reappearance sparked confusion and speculation. Some blamed piracy or hidden exile, but others wondered if the Ouzel had slipped through time, returning unchanged from a different year.


I try to make sense of it all. The lecture, the wardrobe, the boat. I remember the professor’s voice echoing across a packed hall, diagrams of particle entanglement on a yellowing projector screen. The Ouzel Galley returned as if no time had passed for its crew. It was the same year inside their heads, the same day even. My thoughts slide sideways. I have always wanted something strange to happen to me. Not a lottery win. Not a ghost. Just something impossible and quiet. A fracture in the averagely normal. I just did not want it to feel like this.


I start to panic. Not just nerves. Real full blown panic. My chest tightens. My hands are shaking. My throat feels like it is folding in on itself. I start rambling.


“My cat,” I say. “His name is Atreyu. Like from the movie. If I’m here, who’s going to feed him? Who’s going to submit the expense report due tomorrow?”


I look at Adam. “What if no one notices I’m gone? What if they think I just vanished again?”


I can’t breathe. My vision prickles.


Adam’s voice cuts through gently. “Put your head between your legs. Breathe.” Yeah, sure bud.


It’s easy for him to say. He doesn’t know Atreyu. He’s a fussy rag doll of a thing. He only likes wet food, the stuff in the tins with the silver lids. His water has to be filtered and poured fresh, or he’ll meow like he’s dying. If I don’t submit the expense report on time, Susan is going to be passive aggressive again, sending emails with smiley faces and phrases like “just circling back.” Me being here has real world implications. There are dominoes. There is fallout. This is not a daydream. This is disruption. This is total collapse.


Adam doesn’t want to interrupt my spiralling, societal-induced panic, but he leans in slightly, voice low. 


“I need to tell you a few things before Father Mark or the speedheads get wind of you.” I blink at him. He continues, “There are factions here. Groups. You don’t have to join one, but you’ll want to know who’s who before someone tries to claim you.” 


His tone shifts, steadier. “We call ourselves the normies. Normal people, basically. Five of us. We stick together, keep to routines, eat dinner together, try to keep our heads on straight.” I nod slowly. He watches.


Adam rubs his hands together like he is gearing up for something unpleasant.


 “Then there is Father Mark and his lot. Seven of them now. They live in the school. Turned it into their own kind of monastery. Real Bible Bashing types. Think penance and salvation and all that. Mark used to be an alcoholic. Now he thinks this place is some divine test.” 


I glance at him. “What kind of test?” 


He shrugs. “One where the answers do not matter.” He pauses. “They pray. They chant. They fast. But they let you use the library. I negotiated that myself.” 


Adam rubs the side of his bristly face.
“That second road you passed, the one that veers up behind the town hall? Leads to the mansion. That’s where the speedheads live. Four of them. Their ringleader’s Vincent. Wall Street macho-macho type. Slick hair, expensive watch, real self-important.” 


He shifts slightly. “They don’t think any of this is real. Just treat it like a bad trip they’re riding out. Drugs, sex, nonsense theories.” 


I raise an eyebrow. “And 80s girl?” 


“Yeah,” he says. “She’s with them. Has been since she got here. They cling to each other. Makes them feel untouchable.” 


“They’ll both try to recruit you,” Adam says, stepping out of the room so I’ll follow. “The fanatics want your soul. The speedheads want your body. Neither care much about your mind.” 


I trail him down the stairs. “What if I don’t join either?” 


“Then you’re like me,” he says. “We just try to ride it out. Stay sane. Eat dinner together. Keep the days from melting into each other.” 


I pause at the foot of the stairs. “Are we stuck here?” 


He doesn’t look back. “Pretty much,” he says. Like he’s said it before. Like it’s the weather. Fuck.


We reach the front door and I squint outside. The sky hasn’t budged. Same smear of peach and violet along the horizon. 


“It doesn’t move,” Adam says, reading my face. “It’s always like that.” 


I blink. “Always?” 


“Like the sun in Antarctica. Months without change. Throws off your body clock, makes some people crack.” 


I step outside. The air feels the same as when I arrived. “How do you tell the days apart?” 


He shrugs. “Clocks still work. You learn to stop expecting morning or night. Just call it Tuesday and move on.” I’ve never been to fucking Antarctica, dude. 


In Antarctica there are months where the sun does not set at all. This period of constant daylight is known as the Midnight Sun. It disrupts the circadian rhythm in people. Sleep becomes fragmented. Fatigue accumulates. Depression rates rise sharply. A condition known as Polar T3 Syndrome has been observed where thyroid hormones drop, affecting mood and cognitive function. Memory lapses become common. Emotional regulation is diminished. People become more irritable. Some experience mild hallucinations or paranoia. Even with artificial dark rooms the body struggles to recalibrate. Without the natural cycle of day and night the mind begins to unravel.


Adam lingers near the front doorway, rubbing the back of his neck. 


“There’s already food in the fridge,” he says. “Pantry’s stocked. Medicine cabinet too. It’s like a hotel, sort of. One that knows exactly what you need.” 


He pauses, inhaling a sharp breath.
“Come to the town hall in the morning. I’ll fill in more then. It’s getting close to ten.” 


I glance at my phone. Somehow, it is. Even though the sky hasn’t shifted a shade. Still that same haunted dusk. He leaves. I shut the door. Lock it. Turn the bolt. It feels necessary.


I climb the stairs slowly, every step muffled in thick carpet. My bedroom looks like it was decorated fifty years ago. Pale brown curtains, low wooden drawers, yellow lampshade with a fringe. The wallpaper has a strange texture, like it was painted over one too many times. The bed is low to the ground, with mismatched pillows and a wool blanket folded at the end. I do not bother brushing my teeth or washing my face. I just pull back the stiff sheets and lie down. Tomorrow I will meet Adam in the town hall. I need more answers. Sleep comes.
