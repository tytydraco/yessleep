I want to tell you about the worst day of my life. It was a day that changed everything for me—when I lost my sister, Arohi. She was ten years older than me, and after our parents passed, she became both my mother and father. I’m 18 now, living with her and her husband because my college is nearby. Arohi was always protective, but now she’s left me alone to face this world without her. She was my only family.

That morning, I woke up to strange murmurs, people whispering in hushed tones. My heart raced with a sense of dread. I followed the noise to Arohi’s room. A small crowd had gathered. Pushing my way through, I was met with the sight of her. My sister. Hanging lifelessly from the ceiling.

My legs buckled, and I collapsed as if the weight of the world had come crashing down. The crowd worked in silence, pulling her down. The rope creaked and snapped, leaving angry bruises around her neck. I heard someone mutter, “Her body is coming down, but her soul... her soul has ascended.” I stared blankly at her lifeless face, trying to reconcile this nightmare with reality. “She’s in a better place now,” they said. A better place? Just last night, she was here with me. If she sought a better place, why didn’t she take me with her?

The day dragged on in a haze. Arohi’s husband was devastated, barely speaking. I remained silent, trying to process the enormity of my loss. Despite my grief, a part of me felt... relieved. The constant pressure, the unyielding care—suddenly it was gone.

That night, as I lay in bed, the house felt unnervingly silent. The kind of silence that prickles your skin. Then my phone rang, jolting me upright. I checked the screen. My heart stopped—Arohi’s number was flashing.

Her phone was on my bedside table. She was dead. And yet, the phone kept ringing. I didn’t answer. Texts started coming in, one after another:

"I love you, Aryan."

"I will always be with you."

"Forever and ever and ever..."

Cold sweat trickled down my neck. I stared at the screen, trembling. A chilling grin slowly spread across my face—a smile that didn’t belong to me. It hurt to keep it, but I couldn’t stop.

In the eerie stillness, I began to hear Arohi’s voice. Not from the phone, but in my head. It was a distorted, desperate echo.

“What are you doing, Aryan? Please, stop! Don’t do this!” she screamed, her voice filled with fear and anguish. I remembered her pleading eyes, her trembling lips. The way she looked at me as I wrapped the rope around her neck.

“Your love and care are a cage,” I had whispered. “I want to be free. You’re like a shadow, always clinging to me. Why don’t you leave me alone?” Then, I pulled the rope tight. She struggled, her nails digging into my skin, drawing blood, but I didn’t relent. Not until she went still.

I sat in my room, my laughter growing louder, more hysterical. Arohi loved me so much, didn’t she? So much that she defied all limits. She never left me alone, never gave me space. The weight of her love was suffocating.

Suddenly, there was a muffled sound—a scream—from under my bed. Arohi’s husband was hiding there, trembling with terror. I had completely forgotten about him. It was my responsibility to reunite him with Arohi. I crouched down, peering into the darkness. His eyes met mine, wide and filled with dawning horror.

“You’re still alive?” I said, almost disappointed. His lips quivered, and he mumbled something incoherent. I reached for the metal rod I kept by the bed. The cool weight of it felt strangely comforting. With a single, swift motion, I swung it down. Once, twice, three times. His skull caved in with a sickening crunch, warm blood splattering my face. I kept hitting him until there was nothing left but a pulpy mess.

Breathing heavily, I picked up Arohi’s phone and tossed it onto his body. The screen lit up with the final text: "Forever and ever and ever."

So there you have it. The worst day of my life. I lost my sister. My protector. My family. And now, it’s just me... alone.

Or maybe not so alone after all. Because every night, I still hear her voice. Whispering. Crying.

And sometimes, I can almost feel her shadow, forever and ever and ever.
