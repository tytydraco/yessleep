I'm putting this together in my head. It's pretty messy up there right now, so I'm sorry if timelines get weird or things might not add up. 

I've lived in my house for 9 years and grew to be very good friends with the landlord (probably the most unbelievable part of the story, but it's true. He came to my wedding) 

The house has been in need of repairs for years, but Covid happened and we got burned by not one, but two contractors. 

Finally, my wife and I decided this year to make an offer on the house. He agreed, but the house isn't in great condition and needs repairs. Without those he's not getting the true value of the house. 

We agreed to have the repairs completed while we live here, as we know and recommended the contractors. It's a bit of a hassle, obviously, but it's fine, and the dog enjoys the company. All the electricity needs updated from knob and tube(old house) so most of the summer has been ripping open walls. Lots of progress but I look like I live in the last 20 minutes of an A24 film. 

Here's where things get odd. My house is very close to the neighbors houses. Not attached, but nothing but insects could get between them. The contractor comes to my office and says, "I need you to see something." She opened the wall to find the knob and tube electrical but there's no wall. 

It's just the outside of my neighbors house. There's a small bit of rotten installation, but cleared away, it looks like it might have been a window frame originally. Very odd, as the houses were built so close together no light gets between them. And who wants a window to look at dirty brick? 

It's fine, we have a laugh about it. None of us are good with the window theory though. And to move things along, after finding some strange old newspaper clipping and odd totems, we're all thinking it's some type of altar. 

The newspaper clippings are, well, weird. They're not whole articles. Just clips, and they range from house fires, to local hospital donations, to even recipes. But again, its not whole articles. Its just snippets. 

The totems are equally curious. An animal tooth with a twisty tie as a bow around it. A rook with a downward arrow carved badly into it. Some action figure, I think maybe a G.I. Joe, with the face missing. I can't tell if it's due to time or shaved off. A minute hourglass with red sand. 

At this point, the whole house breathes at night. I mean there's missing windows, holes in walls, it's to be expected. 

But that alter in the bathroom, it sounds like it actually breathes. On nights where the air feels like still water in this heat, you can almost hear that room exhale. 

And then the couch incident happened. We can't move the couch. We move it all the time. It's not a heavy couch. But I dropped my hat behind it, and all of a sudden, I can't move this couch. No one can. FOUR of us can't. We came to the conclusion its stuck on something, and we'd get to it when it's an actual problem. Right now, it isn't and we need the walls closed up before cold weather hits. 

Well, I fell asleep watching tv two weeks ago, and woke up to my foot bleeding. A perfect circular chunk, ripped out of my heel. I just figured it was my stupid ass getting my foot stuck on an exposed piece of wood. 

3 nights later, I fall asleep again. I wake up to a pool of blood around my foot. 3 small gashes. I don't see anything I could have cut my foot on in sight. 

Last night. I wake up. Blood all over the couch. My feet weren't even on the floor. I go to the weird altar bathroom to clean up. 

The scratch this time is deep, in my left heel, and is a downward arrow like what was etched in the rook. 

I haven't told anyone. I put the pieces together today, and decided to just throw my thoughts on the internet. I don't know what to do or think. 

Sorry, this is ongoing. There's no closure or resolution here. Happy to answer any questions, and I'll update if it's warranted.
