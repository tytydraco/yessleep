It had been an extremely mundane day for me—your perfectly average sixteen-year-old boy—until I had tucked myself into bed. Normally, I would scroll through posts on Reddit or Instagram to keep myself occupied. Most of the time—I would fall asleep within an hour of doom-scrolling on these various social-media platforms.

I had plugged my phone into the charger and—when I heard the familiar beep that signified that my phone was charging—I sank myself into the fabric-like platform of my mattress. I closed my eyes while listening to the gentle whir of my fan. Hot Summer nights were truly a pain in the ass.

I wasn't sure or able to estimate how long I had been asleep for before I was awoken by a blood-curdling scream of absolute agony. When I had opened up my eyes in alarm to check out the situation, my ear-drums were flooded by terrible and nasty noises. I lurched up to a standing-position.

All around me—there was a red-hued flood of fire. This heat couldn't even compare to the warmth of the Sun. I felt as though my body would melt into a puddle of soup-like flesh at any second. Another blood-curdling yell of pain reached my ears. I turned in the direction of the loud scream.

A gasp of endless shock, confusion, and unbridled ***fear*** escaped my lips. I was stuck inside of some type of torture-room. There were two people—a handsome man and a beautiful women. The man was covered in lacerations. His arms were chopped off and his mouth was opened. He lacked a tongue.

I glanced over in perpetual trepidation at the woman. She was unharmed—or so I thought. She wasn't facing me. I anxiously approached her and tapped her on the shoulder. The lady snapped her head towards me and I swear I heard her bones *crack*. Blood poured out from her red-tinged eyes.

My body stumbled backwards in a gait of natural fear and bafflement. She stretched a blood-soaked hand at me before she fell down to the ground—clutching her head and screaming and screaming. I took a fast gander at the man. He was standing up and staggered over to me, panting and groaning.

"S-Sir?" I asked him. A massive amount of fear lurked within my tone. "A-Are you—."

The man interrupted me and clung onto my shoulders. His tongue-less mouth opened itself up again and he vomited some type of green ooze over my body. He tilted his head at an unnatural angle before he collapsed down next to the women—extending his hand out to hers and holding it.

My mind had gone numb in fear at this point before I heard a harmonic laugh and a gruff chortle. I immediately turned around and stared at the entrance to this torture-room. There were two individuals—no *demons*. One was masculine in appearance while another was feminine-looking.

"My. My. My." The feminine devil hummed. She had long tresses of crimson hair and wore a red-colored summer-dress. A grotesque tail swayed itself behind her body. "What do we have here."

"No clue." The buff and masculine demon drawled. There was a pleasant inflection in his deep baritone. "Hey, kid!" He shouted at me. Curiosity tainted his tone. "Who the fuck are you?"

I was frozen in absolute terror and stammered out a meek response. "Well..." I was an overall laid-back and apathetic individual in general—but these two foul creatures elicited some type of dread inside of me. I gulped and slipped my hands into my pockets. "M-My name is..." *Think of something fake...*

"Daniel Rogers!" I suppressed the urge to slap myself in the face at the stupidity of my name. The masculine devil touched his neck and rubbed its flesh. I noticed how prickly, smooth, and wrinkled his skin seemed to the untrained human eye. I had hoped this was a lucid dream. "Nice to meet you?"

"Yeah. A real pleasure." He rolled his abyssal eyes of vermillion and grunted. "I can't sense hellish aura from him. Lucifer...Is this kid some type of new demon? Did you send him here for training?"

"Hm..." Lucifer—***as in ruler of Hell Lucifer?!***—hid a smile behind a dainty hand. "I can't recall designating a mere child to torture-room B. Perhaps he is an aberration, created from a soul?"

I couldn't carry on listening to their nonsensical conversation and plotted my escape. The main issue was that Lucifer and Satan—the dude looked like a Satan—were blocking the entrance to the room. I inspected the area and noticed the severed tongue of the man. Well...It could have been worse.

I discreetly picked up the tongue while Lucifer and Satan were looking through some type of catalogue and launched it into his face. Satan blinked in absolute bafflement as I raced out of the room. I rushed through a seemingly endless corridor before I realized I was falling.

A cloud of dust had covered my vision when I landed onto my back on a smooth terrain. It was a strange feeling...My body felt absolutely zero pain. I gazed up and realized I had fallen down from some type of cliff. Panic erupted within me before I began to check my surroundings.

It was a horrifying sight. Corpses of several individuals were strewn across the concrete. A man dragged his body towards me and extended a mutilated hand in my direction. His eye-sockets were nothing more than balls of fire. He screamed and screamed. Another man tapped my shoulder.

He was average in mien and had an amiable smile on his chiseled face. I opened my mouth to speak to him and let out a yell of unmixed horror when he took off his face itself. I turned away and sprinted down the path on the concrete until I stumbled into a ginormous rock. There was a single hand.

The hand had a phone—this phone was one connected to the Internet somehow. Please! I need help! I can feel it in my very flesh. Those two horrific creatures are chasing after me. Help! Help! Help! This isn't a dream. I've punched, pinched, and tickled myself. I've slammed my head into the rock.

Damn it all...I can feel those two creatures' presence!
