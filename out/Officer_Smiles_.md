I believe there is more than one Officer Smiles around, though I can’t prove that. It just seems impossible for him to always be near criminal activity where it happens every time.

My town doesn’t have a police department, not technically. We technically don’t have police. We just have Officer Smiles. 

No one can pinpoint where he came from, all we have is tall tales and best guesses. He takes care of all the crime in our town. 

Drug dealers, sex offenders, thugs, none of them last long in our town. Our town has the lowest crime rate ever. 

The description of him is that he has soft and brown curly hair under his police hat. He wears an old school officer uniform much like one you would see on The Andy Griffith show. He doesn’t carry a gun, he’s never needed one yet. But he always has a very big smile that never drops. Some may consider him a necessary evil. Everyone is forced to behave and not speed in their cars. 

We have paramedics who claim those who do wrong around Officer Smiles were beyond what they could do to help. Though some have gotten off “light.” I never seen him before, until last month.

I was at a bar with one of my buddies and we were shooting some pool. We were drinking a couple cold beers when we heard some commotion. 

Two guys were arguing and so close that their noses were touching. The bartender tried her best to calm them down and some other patrons knew what happens when trouble occurs, some were leaving immediately. Me? I was wanting to see a fight. 

One shoved the other and they began throwing fists at another. The bartender let out a scream and people were moving out of the way. The guys were in the ground now, one with a bloody nose and the other with some teeth chipped. Then we heard the gunshot.

I put my hands over my ears as the high pitch ringing grew louder. I turn my head and see an officer with a revolver pointed up at the sky, he had a smile from ear to ear. 

He tucked his revolver back in his holster and scanned the area with his green eyes. I could have sworn I didn’t see him blink at all. He put his hands on his belt.

“Well, what do we have here? A couple of tough guys stirring trouble in my town?” He turned his head sideways and I heard his neck crack. 

The guy with the bloody nose stood up and tried to make a run for the door. The officer grabbed him by the head and jerked back. His body dropped but his head didn’t. Blood began spewing across the floor. Others began to scream. His uniform was getting stained. He shot in the air again. 

“Would you like to make a run for it also, pal?” He looked at chipped tooth with a big smile. He dropped the head. 

“No sir.” Everyone in the bar was silent 

“Put your hands behind your back.” He walked over to him and put handcuffs on. 

“So am I going to jail tonight? I’m fully cooperating.” 

“Hmmm…no, a night in the cell would do good for you.”

“I thought we don’t even have a jail here.” 

“Not one that you know about.” 

He began to escort chipped tooth out the door when he stopped and took a whiff of air. He turned his head to me.

“Are you planning on driving tonight?” His smile. I had a small buzz and I could tell he knew it too. 

“No…one of my buddies is being our driver, he don’t drink at all.” 

“That’s a good boy.”

He pushed chipped tooth out the door and into the back of his squad car. I watched out the window as a sinkhole developed in the parking lot and they drove into it.

The bar posted on Facebook today that they would close down if they didn’t have any business. I sure didn’t plan on going back. It’s not their fault, but I’m done with bars after seeing a man’s head ripped off. 

Some people online talk about how they missed bloody nose. His real name was Gavin and was a mechanic. And our town never formally announced what happened, just bragging about our low crime rate. 

One of my buddies seen chipped tooth at a gas station today. He tried talking to him at the pump but said the guy didn’t acknowledge him or anyone. He was pale white and just stared off into the void. It was as if it was just the shell of the man standing there. I found out his name was Jim.

Another buddy of mine works at the same factory as Jim. He said that he was a talkative guy who worked hard and had people always laughing. Now, he just shows up to work and barely gets anything done. Won’t say a word unless he has to. 

All I know is, we are forced to behave. Officer Smiles makes sure of that.
