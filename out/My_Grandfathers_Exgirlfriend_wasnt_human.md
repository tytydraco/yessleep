I posted this on r/Paranormal, but I think it might be alright to post it here as well. 

I'm a bit skeptical about this true story from my Grandfather, but the more I thought about it, the more horrifying it is. 

So, for I bit of background. I'm half-filipino and half-american, every summer my parents and I would visit the Philippines and usually stay at my Grandparent's place. A week ago, my Grandpa, on my mom's side, told me this true story from his youth. The way he said it, I noticed that he was still shaken and scared from whatever happened. 

So here's the story. Back in 1970, when my Grandpa was 18, he was dating this girl who was a year younger than him for over a year, let's call this girl S. 

S was beautiful, sweet, kind, and easy on the eyes, according to him. When summer started, S invited him to her parent's home in the province. S was currently staying with her aunt while she went to school in my grandpa's town. 

My Grandpa was skeptical at first, because the area that S lived in was quite rural, and would take 5 hours to arrive by bus. But, Grandpa was infatuated with S so he said "Eh, why the hell not?" 

So, with permission from his parents. He packed up and he and S were on their way. When they arrived at her hometown, he noticed that a lot of people were staring at them. It was a small town, so the population wasn't that big.

S showed him around, where the shops were, the diners etc. But Grandpa would notice people staring at them, and one time he heard a couple whisper "Aswang."

If you're wondering, what the hell an Aswang is. In Filipino folklore, an Aswang is a malevolent, shape-shifting, flesh-eating monster. From what I learned, by the day they look and act like normal people, however at night they reveal their true selves. 

Back to the story, so S and grandpa arrive at S's house. It was a large, 3 story, wooden home. Grandpa then met S's parents, they greeted him warmly and invited him in, and exchanged talks over dinner. Grandpa said that they seemed like a couple of nice normal people. 

On the 1st night, he was sleeping in S's room on the 2nd floor. Grandpa woke up hearing a strange noise, the first thing he noticed was that S was gone, he assumed that she must've went to the bathroom so he lied down again. But the weird sound continued. 

It was coming from the floor above him, he said that it sounded like a cat scratching its claws on the wooden floor, accompanied by what sounded like a person mumbling. He tried to ignore it, but it started getting louder, until he could hear multiple clawing noises from above, like multiple cats scratching on the wooden floor as well as mumbling. 

S still hasn't come back at this point, which made him worry. That's when he heard loud thumping from upstairs, like a person jumping. Grandpa is really weirded out at this point, so covers his ears with his pillow. 

The next day, he told S that their cats were really loud and that he couldn't sleep. S just looked at him confused and said "We don't have cats." 

"Huh? That's weird, I could've sworn I heard cats last night." He said. 

On the 2nd night, he was woken up again by the same sounds. He says, at that point he was thinking "What the f*ck?" 

Then he hears loud grunting from above, like an animal in pain. He tries going back to sleep, but then he's startled by what sounded like a roar. 

This continues for another day, until on the 4th night. Grandpa decided he had enough, he was gonna man up, march upstairs, and see what the hell was going on. 

So, it was around one in the morning, according to him. He said it was strange, because he didn't hear any more of the weird sounds, but he decided to go upstairs anyway. 

He tiptoed across the floor and reached the stairs leading to the 3rd floor. Once he reached the 3rd floor, he notices something weird. The lights wouldn't work, even though they were working fine before he went to bed, the only source of light was the moonlight which illuminated the interior. 

He makes his way to the room that was above him on the 2nd floor, where the sounds were coming from, and what he saw made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. The floor was littered with claw marks, the windows were wide open, and there were blood stains across the floor. 

There were no signs of S or her parents anywhere. Freaked out, he went down back to the 2nd floor. But then, his nose caught a whiff of something he hadn't noticed before, it was coming from the kitchen. 

Curious, he went to take a look, but it was so dark that he could barely make anything out. As he walked, his hand touched something that felt like a large metal pot. 

He opened the lid, a great number of flies escape, and his nose was assaulted an extremely awful, putrid smell, that he said nearly made him vomit. It was so dark that he couldn't see what was inside the pot, so he immediately slammed down the lid and run back to the room, and forced himself to sleep. 

The next day, during lunch, S's mother served dinuguan (animal blood that's been cooked, and mixed with herbs and spices.)

But my Grandpa excused himself and lied that he was sick, he didn't want to know what was in the food. S's mother tried to coax him to eat, saying that he'll regain his energy. 

This is when Granpa takes the opportunity to find out the truth.

You see, in the folklore, to identify whether or not a person is an Aswang is quite simple. Observe their eyes, if your reflection is upside down then they're an Aswang. 

Grandpa stared at S's Mom's eyes and reeled back in horror. 

His reflection was upside down. 

This is when the Mom's expression completely changes. She went from concerned to angry, and was glaring hard at Grandpa, an expression that basically says, according to him, "You shouldn't have done that." 

That night, Grandpa doesn't waste time and immediately packs up and heads home. Lying that there's been a family emergency, in order for him to go. 

He finally returns home, and spent a lot of time inside his house in complete fear. The following month, he breaks up with S. 

She looked at him in sadness, and said that she understands. That it was a wise choice for him, but it was quite a shame. 

Granpa ended the story. He says that it was a huge shame indeed, because he really wanted to marry S. 

What do you all think? What are your thoughts and opinions about this story?

**EDIT:** So I asked Grandpa for more info and details about the story. He said that he has trouble remembering a couple of things, but from he could recall.

After the first night, he asked S where she went because he woke up and couldn't find her. S said that she was in the bathroom due to an irritable stomach.

Then he asked about the weird noises last night, and if she heard them. He said that she was silent for a moment, before casually responding that sometimes a group of cats would climb up their roof. What a weird excuse.
