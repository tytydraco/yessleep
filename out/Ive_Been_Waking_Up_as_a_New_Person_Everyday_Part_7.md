Hey it's Katie here again, tying up some loose ends and posting in lieu of OP. I'm sure he would have wanted me to proofread and fix any clerical errors. I have decided to leave his words as is due to my own personal beliefs. I am sorry. I will at the very least compile his previous posts.

First off, his name was Josh. Oliver was his nephew. I think that may be enough to clear some of the names up. It looks like he used fake names for the most part so I'll keep the rest as is. The last post was all over the place partially due to it being my first time posting on this forum and the actual events of it happening on November of last year.  I will be clearing a few things up since I now know that his story was true. We had been corresponding through messenger throughout the past 3 years. He kept me at a distance, not revealing his hand due to his situation. Richard Scott Humphries was a serial killer, responsible for the death of hundreds, though he died as a nameless child predator according to the police and papers. I will let Josh's name rest without revelation or misrepresentation.

I'll leave it at that when it comes to his story. My story is pretty self explanatory. I was simply the girlfriend of a serial killer's victim and I helped kill them both. Of course my boyfriend was murdered by him, but I suppose I helped through my own inaction, at least according to the themes of Josh's narrative. I had been carrying that guilt for 3 long years. I suppose it's time to let go. I'll leave you with a letter that arrived in the mail before I sat down to finish this.

  
A Letter

Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I'm safe. The pain is different now. There's no new serial killer or grand problem to solve, though who knows for sure. Anyway, I spend every day in retirement homes now. I talk when I can and when I can't, I at least try to smile. Most of the time though, I just stare into space. I miss my mom. I miss my family. I miss my friends. I miss the opportunities to make new ones. When I'm wheeled out, I enjoy the scenery.

My hands stop shaking when they are held. I can't hold hands back but it still feels like something. I suppose if anything, the peace that I have now is that I did love my life. I really did. The people around me made me in love with the world. But the world is not mine.

Time is not mine. These bodies are not mine. I don't know if this is the curse ending or if it will turn into a blessing. I pray that life will go on and people will learn to love each other anyway they can. Or maybe they already do. Love is not mine. It is Jesus' in heaven.

I truly believe that. I will learn to trust God and move forward. 

Until I do.

Sweet Dreams,

Joshua Packoshua
