I have never posted before, but I figured I would ask for some advice.

My roommate and I moved into our apartment around the beginning of September this year. I toured it beforehand, and the landlord mentioned the building was 100+ years old. No biggie, I liked the vintage charm. It is a two story apartment with the main level housing the kitchen, living room, and a full bathroom. The two bedrooms are upstairs.

I am a skeptic, while my roommate is more open-minded. There are two sizeable crawlspaces for storage, both of which have small handles and latch closed. My bedroom has an additional storage space door without a latch, and my roommates closet is huge.

The closet has two doors separated by a tiny piece of the wall. As my roommate was unpacking, she found a large glass bottle (almost like one of those fancy olive oil bottles) tucked away behind the sliver of wall between the doors. It was covered in thick layers of wax in red, pink, purple, yellow, etc. It freaked her out and I reassured her it was probably just used to hold a pillar candle, but I offered to look at it for her. There was a bunch of stuff in the bottle; rocks, herbs, etc. so we decided it was probably a spell bottle. The wax prevented us from getting a good look inside. 

The second thing we noticed (and joked about) was how weird the storage space in my bedroom was. The door is tiny and carpeted, and the previous tenants had left behind fairy lights. Its extremely hot in there, so I was just planning to throw whatever extra things I couldn't find a place for inside. When my roommate went to look inside for the first time, we found some type of burnt (sage possibly?) bundle and an abalone shell. Didn't like all of that, but still not scared of the little space. It wasn't until I started hearing weird stuff from behind the door that I piled a bunch of stuff in front of it and never opened it again. The sounds are sometimes like a clicking/scratching and the door will open and shut constantly. I comforted myself by concluding the noises were just old house sounds or residual sounds from the other tenants next to or below us. The building is an old house made into a bunch of apartments, so I figured the door shutting and opening was just some weird airflow issues. Still kinda spooky, so I just propped my guitar case against it and never acknowledged the sounds in case. 

Then the scary shit happened. I stay the night at my boyfriends a lot, so my roommate will be home alone at night frequently. She is a night owl, so she will stay up way into the 2-3am hours. She swears on a couple of occasions she has heard things in the apartment, specifically in my voice, when I am not home. I thought she was making up stories or freaking herself out because she was so tired. Then, our friend was in the house alone (we are really close, and she wanted to take a nap) while my roommate ran out for an errand. She adamantly swears up and down that in the middle of the day she could hear MY voice from the living room. 

I was still skeptical and just thought they were playing on each others fears until the other day. I was sitting at my vanity doing my hair and my roommate was hanging out in her room. My vanity is right next to my door, and as I'm getting ready it SWINGS open and hits me, and I swore I heard her calling me from downstairs. I was scared, I didn't call back or move, and I texted her to see if she was still in her room. She didn't answer so I got up and opened her door and asked her if she called me from the living room, but she told me she hadn't moved. 

I made her walk downstairs with me to check it out, but nothing seemed off. We walked into the kitchen and found that all the knives and the scissors I had been asking her for weeks if she knew where they had gone were all replaced back into the knife block. I grilled her and told her to stop messing with me and admit she had put them all back and was just trying to freak me out, but she swore (and genuinely I believe her) that she did not. 

Little things go missing or move, faint whispers to normal talking voices are heard, and there is always this weird energy that you aren't completely alone. The fact that it is our own voices makes it feel so sinister, and I went from not even considering paranormal activity in my whole life to feeling uneasiness no matter the time when I am home. Am I being subconsciously paranoid because of their stories? I swear I heard her calling me in the apartment. Should I be concerned? Does it seem like the old tenants were trying to cleanse the place from whatever is going on?
