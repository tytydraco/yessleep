Jake pulled up in his car, headlights illuminating drops of ice-cold rain in the blue light of an overcast dawn. We had agreed to meet early; the journey to the mountains was quite a long drive, and we wanted as much daylight as we could get. 

  



He stepped out of the car, coffee in hand and oddly high-spirited. 

  



‘Mornin’! Have a few pressies for ya.’ 

  



He popped the boot open, and I laid my eyes on a small arsenal. 

  



A hunting rifle and a shotgun, surrounded by their respective ammunition along with an assortment of knives and tools. 

  



‘Used to go hunting with one of the lads before he went to prison, said I’d look after everything for him. I’m sure he won’t mind us putting them to good use while he’s away. We are hunting after all - sure it’s what these are for!’ 

  



I didn’t want to ask any questions about Jake’s prison friend, nor did I care to know in that moment. I now had what I didn’t have as a child - the power to fight back. I nodded in silent approval, Jake mirroring my gesture with a relishing grin. 

  



We jumped in the car and went on our way. Our time on the motorway was spent catching up, asking each other about how our lives had gone, the banal icebreakers we had skipped as we got caught up in our plans. Work, family, some laughs about nostalgic moments from school. 

  



I had forgotten about the good moments, being so caught up in the bad. I wish we could have stayed chatting like that, but the dark mountains looming against the grey morning sky in the distance served as a constant reminder of what had to be done. 

  



I saw their valleys, running deep where the morning light couldn’t reach. A chill ran down my spine despite the car’s heat. I felt as if I was being watched from the sea of black trees covering the mountain’s face, even from this distance. 

  



Jake pointed to a bag at my feet. 

  



‘There’s a laptop in that bag there, can you fire it up? Need you to see a few things before we arrive. There’s a folder on the desktop there, go into it and have a look at the stuff inside.’ 

  



I clicked into the folder, simply titled “scout stuff”. 

  



Within was a collection of files; images and .pdfs of newspaper articles from online and scanned paper archives. Jake had organised them by date - I never would have thought he would have the capacity to bother, going by his past behaviours and schoolwork. This had evidently consumed him to the point he hyperfixated on every detail of it all. 

  



The files listed missing persons reports, starting from soon after our scout's trip. 

  



The first of course, was Counsellor Murphy. After her were random people - hikers, campers and cyclists. Along with these reports were forum screenshots of people discussing urban legends, talking about all the missing people in the mountains. 

  



One user “Dylbrack05” stated they would investigate and record the whole thing. I grimaced as the next file was a missing persons report for one Dylan Bracken, 19. 

  



The final report was dated from just last month. 

  



‘All these years…’ 

  



‘Yeah, they’ve been at it since the scout's trip. I couldn’t find much more from earlier years. I reckon that we were unlucky enough to go on that trip at the same time those things appeared.’ 

  



‘So where did they come from? There has to be some place they stay in the woods. Are there any caves in the mountains?’ 

  



‘I looked it up and there is only one, and it's tiny. Not to mention it’s a good bit away from the cabin and it’s in the middle of a farmer’s field. But that’s the only one they know about.’ 

  



‘So there could be more.’ 

  



Before long, we were winding our way through the mountain roads, heavy raindrops plunking into the windshield as they fell from low-hanging branches. I stared into the woods, my breaths running shallow as I dreaded to see anything staring back. My mind raced as I thought not only of the woods that now had us in its clutches, but of the caves that could be running deep beneath them. 

  



As we drove down a steep decline, the cabin loomed before us. 

  



Broken windows, black and grimy with age. Nonsensical graffiti. Porch fence splintered and damaged. A hole in the roof from a branch sent flying by the storms of years past. 

  



As Jake turned off his car, an eerie silence descended upon the valley. The diffused grey light from the overcast sky lent the scene a dreamlike atmosphere. I felt as if I was walking into one of my many nightmares all over again. That if I were to step into the impenetrable black of the cabin door, I would snap awake, heart pounding and drenched in cold sweat. 

  



Well, imagine how hard my heart pounded when a fox suddenly sprinted from the doorway, startling us both.  

  



Jake and I looked at each other, and laughed at our utter loss of composure. 

  



‘Keep running ya little bollox ya!’ he shouted playfully after the fox. 

  



We retrieved two flashlights from the boot of the car, and proceeded inside the cabin. *At least I have a working light this time around.* 

  



The air was a wild mix of mountain air cleansed by rain, and decades-old mould and wood rot. It wafted into our faces accompanied by hints of an old fire.  

  



Grey light shone through the hole in the roof, drops of rain tumbling into the wreck of an old tent now bloated and soaked. Our lights painted across old beer cans and bottles that dotted the floor. 

  



Whoever created this mess hadn’t been here in years. Whether they left of their own accord - or were taken - remained to be seen. 

  



We explored the remainder of the cabin. Scenes of the scout's trip past played behind our eyes as we looked upon the dead spaces that were all that remained of them. The warped floorboards where sleeping bags were set, the corner where bags were stacked, stuffed with warm clothes and a dozen lovingly-packed lunches. The fire, once intended to be roaring on those cold nights, now only a heap of damp soot and old twigs. 

  



Silence overtook us as we were lost in memory, wandering around and reminiscing. 

  



I drifted outside, not caring for the rain. Out the back, I saw Jake standing by the shattered remains of the wood bunker. He stared down, eyes wide as he was lost in the horrible memory of what he saw inside it. I knew whose eyes stared back at him in his reverie. 

  



‘Jake.’ 

  



He shook his head and snapped to attention, seemingly glad of the interruption. 

  



‘Sorry. So!’ he paused to clap his hands. ‘Why don’t you show me in the woods where the Counsellor touched you?’ 

  



‘Too soon.’ 

  



We both chuckled, half at his bad joke and half at the very fact we felt like chuckling at all. We were both more nervous being here than either of us would care to admit. 

  



We put on light waterproof jackets, but with our hoods down - we needed to be alert. Jake took his hunting rifle, being the more experienced shot between the two of us, and gave me a shotgun. He showed me the basics on how to use it, but we agreed not to practice, for fear of giving away our presence - if our presence wasn’t detected already. 

  

  

Steeling myself, I brought him uphill, towards the clearing where I was attacked. My heart began to pound, and I tried in vain to convince myself that it was just the uphill ascent. But the nearer I got, the more nauseous I felt, and the more my hands began to shake. Phantom stones dug into the sole of my foot as I remembered the cold road under my bare foot as I ran. 

  

  

My heart leapt into my chest as I almost stepped into the very patch of bog that ensnared me. 

  

  

We neared the clearing, and I saw it remained exactly as it was those many years ago. I scanned the scene for anything of note, and that’s when the smell hit me. That awful reek, the very same that assailed my senses whenever that thing began to whet whatever depraved appetites it had. It was faint however, carried on the breeze coming down from the hills. 

  



‘In case you’re wondering, that’s what it smells like.’ I told Jake, never taking my eyes off the woods. ‘That smell is how you know the mask is slipping. That’s what they really smell like. It was faint when it looked like Counsellor Murphy, but when it showed its true form, it made me want to get sick.’ 

  



‘Let’s follow it so. It’ll regret smelling this bad if it leads us right to it, manky bastard.’ 

  



We made our way uphill, eyes peeled and noses keen as we begrudgingly followed the scent.  

  



We arrived at a large clearing. It was a patch of marshland, surrounded by trees. Large stones dotted the perimeter, with most sunken into the muck and covered in moss. They formed a perfect ring around the treeline. Any passer-by might have missed them, so sunken into the ground they were, but they once might have stood taller. In the centre was a narrow crevice in the ground.  

  



It was a jagged maw in the earth, stone teeth covered by sticks and hanging moss. We barely noticed it but for the damp moss hanging lower thanks to the rain, exposing the darkness beneath.  

  



We peeled the moss and sticks away, shining our lights into the depths. The crevice curved away from the light’s path, leaving us unsure of how deep it went. 

  



‘I have just the thing for this, let’s head back to the car for a minute.’ 

  



We returned shortly with some climbing equipment. 

  



Jake fastened the rope around one of the standing stones, tugging it taut until he was sure it would support us. 

  



‘Rock-paper-scissors on who goes first?’ he suggested with a nervous laugh. 

  



I offered to go first, seizing the rope before Jake could protest, and while my nerves were still steady. 

  



The cave was sloped, and so I was able to rappel down quite easily. It was difficult to focus with the foul smell that wafted up from the depths. I kept glancing downwards, trying to stay on guard should anything rush at me from the dark. 

  



I arrived at the bottom shortly. The cave had curved away from the entrance in a bend that prevented it from receiving any light. I stood guard, shining my light to aid Jake’s descent, occasionally glancing behind me as the drips of cave water played tricks on my mind. 

  



Once Jake was on solid ground, we pressed on further in the cave. It wound a short way into the earth going gently downwards, until it opened up into a large cavern. 

  



The cavern was deeper than we could have anticipated. A ring of rocky ledge ran around it as far as we could see, with everything else being rocky abyss. 

  



Nearby us, we saw piles of detritus. Bags, tents, ragged clothes dirtied with old muck and blood. The remains I could have left behind if I hadn’t been fast enough those years ago. 

  



A camera lay among the pile, drenched from exposure to dripping cave water. I pry it open, hoping to learn more. The camera’s innards were practically rusted shut, the green verdigris telling me of the memory card’s fate. 

  



‘That’s probably your man Dylan Bracken. He said he was gonna record his search.’ said Jake. 

  



‘Probably won’t learn much from it - the SD card is just a sliver of rust now.’ 

  



Among the pile, we found more unusual items. A rusted plate of metal, rusted until it was practically crumbling, and some equally rusted hooks tied to old frayed rope. The metal plate seemed to be armour, like a medieval knight’s cuirass, but lighter and less clunky. 

  



I turned to Jake, intending to ask him what he thought of the pieces of junk, and my heart stopped dead. 

  



Coiled behind him was a serpentine bundle of pale flesh, a foul smile of black lips and rotten fangs, cloaked in matted black hair. Jake followed my gaze and immediately jumped forward, opting not to turn his head so as not to broadcast his jump; but the thing was too quick. 

  



It wrapped the stump of its tail around his legs, dragging him back and tripping him. He dropped his rifle and light, and was ensnared in a desperate grapple with the creature. 

  



I took aim with the shotgun, but their struggle was too chaotic, the cave too dark; the spread of the shotgun might have hit Jake. 

  



I attempted to close the distance for a point-blanc shot, but Jake’s discarded light illuminated something approaching from the cave depths. Something with too many joints rushing right towards me. 

  



I backed up in frightful panic, stumbling on the detritus behind me as the patter of many hands slapped towards me. I managed to fire one-well placed shot into what might have been the creature’s face. 

  



A splash of brackish blood sprayed across the cave floor, but the creature kept coming. I was knocked to the ground, a dozen hands scratching and slapping in a feverish frenzy at the meal that had been denied to them two decades ago. 

  



I punched, gouged, bit in a mindless bid to survive, my senses flooded with adrenaline and the stink of the thing’s flesh. 

  



I reached around me as worm-fingered hands seized my throat, trying desperately to seize any piece of detritus that might be my salvation. 

  



My hands came to rest upon cold metal, flakes of rust. Blindly I swung it into the creatures mass, and the cave was filled with the twang of metal and the creature’s mad screeching. It was a keening of pain and anger, an inhuman bawling that seemed to come from multiple phlegmy throats at once. 

  



I sucked down grateful lungfuls of foul air as the beast released me. Staggering to my feet, I readied the metal as a shield or a club, whichever was needed first. The thing writhed in agony, steam rising from a peculiar burn mark where the metal collided with its pallid flesh. The stink of burnt offal filled the cave. I realised the power I now held. 

  



I took up the roped iron piton, and threw it to Jake.  

  



‘Stab it with the iron! The iron hurts them!’ 

  



I preyed he heard me during his struggle; I had to focus on charging the thing in front of me. I ran at it, slamming the metal into the meat of its body, pounding severe burns into its body where I hit it, and sending severe inflamed sores across its skin where I grazed it. 



I lost control. I hammered it into the cave floor, branding it with my anger over and over again for a childhood robbed. 

  



Before long, it was reduced to a pile of sizzling flesh. My hands shook, covered in brackish blood and flakes of rust. I would need a tetanus shot, but I can assure you, it was worth it. 

  



I looked to Jake, and saw him dishing out similar punishment. He had gouged a gaping series of wounds into the thing’s serpentine neck, and now straddled it as it tried desperately to squirm away. Over and over he stabbed, working his way up until its head remained - clearly, he didn’t want it to die too fast. 

  



‘This is for Breda ya fuckin’ scumbag!’ 

  



I couldn’t help but laugh as he silenced the thing’s screams forever. He uttered the words as if it were some boy that broke Breda’s heart rather than some otherworldly monstrosity. The elation of my own triumph and the juxtaposition of his words against what we faced sent me into a breathless laughing fit. 

  



Once he caught his own breath, Jake did the same. 

  



There in the darkness of the cavern, lying among our childhood enemies now broken and slain, we reclaimed at least some of the innocence we had lost. 

  



We left the cavern, and alerted the local authorities of its presence. We cited it as being deep and somewhat hidden, and that hikers or children might get trapped or injured because of it. It wasn’t long before they put up a metal fence around it, topped with spikes. 

  



We didn’t know how deep the cavern went, or if there were other entrances - or other creatures. For now, we hoped that the iron mixed within the steel fence would do as much as the ancient iron we had weaponised against the creatures, imprisoning the creatures within their cave. 

  



I may have set out looking for answers, but I suppose it was natural that I wouldn’t find many. But I did find a sort of carefree joy as I destroyed the creature, a childish joy I haven’t felt in decades. 

  



The forests and dark places of the world still fill me with a ghost of childhood fear, but now, they also fill me with excitement. I enjoy the fear. I enjoy the threats. 

 



And now, my fellow hunter and I will enjoy hunting more of them down.
