Hey everyone, Edward here again. 

Yeah, the same guy who wrote about the demon in the basement of the chicken plant, in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/SWFfmq2teT) post.

As you could probably tell by the sign-off on my last post, I got a promotion somewhere between when my story took place in 2006 and when I actually posted it. Shift Manager. A big pay increase came right along with it, as well as a whole hell of a lot more responsibilities. I even got a trip to Switzerland for training (which I now know is where the unofficial headquarters of the "sciency" types are, not Sweden as I'd previously thought).

I thought I'd reached the top of the totem pole, since I didn't care too much about taking over the Plant Manager position. Let's just say, I'm not much of a *day* person.

Like I said, I *thought* I'd reached the top.

Turns out, I was still scraping the bottom of the barrel.

\---

On the 20th of October, the night after I made my post, the men came to the plant at 3 a.m. Two of them, wearing the same black coats with insignias as the Technologians who manage that beast in the basement. The taller one knocked at my office door like a cop. I thought, perhaps, they had found my previous post and were coming for my knee-caps. I'm glad I was wrong.

“Edward? We have a new assignment for you.”

The shorter one said, in a now-familiar accent. He handed me a sealed envelope; no address, just my name and a symbol: a triangle inside a circle. I opened the envelope and began reading parts of it aloud. "Containment Team Lead... seek out and contain KF-based anomalies... salary would be... HOLY CRAP!"

The taller of the two smiled at my sudden outburst. "Yeah, that's usually the reaction."

Only four words came to mind.

***"When do I start?"***

\---

I was in Switzerland the next day. The facility sat halfway up a mountain and halfway underground. The informal name for it was the "Thunder Dome." I would find out why on day four of my training.

Everything inside hummed the same familiar hum from the chicken plant back home: lights, floors, even the walls.

They took our phones and watches and gave us black tactical gear with the same triangle-and-circle patch I'd seen before. No names adorned the uniforms, just alphanumeric designations. Mine was "TL-13".

Four other recruits joined my group:

Thatcher, designated AR-13.

Miller: designated CH-13.

Dwyer: designated ME-13.

And Holmgren: designated EN-13.

We sat around for a few minutes before Thatcher finally broke the ice:

"So, uh, I'm guessing youse guys ran into some weird shit back home too? I was about three weeks into an investigation in Brooklyn when they came to me with this job proposition. Got tipped off about a human trafficking ring by a priest from a local church in that area, some goons from Eastern Europe bringing in a bunch of people in shipping containers... turns out, it wasn't exactly "people" that was being transported... well, they *looked* like people, but they sure didn't *act* like people." He said, eyeing the room nervously.

"Yeah, something like that," Miller responded, gravely. "I was stationed in Germany with the rest of my platoon. Some tall pale creep that bullets didn't seem to do anything to came down, tearing a mountain and ripped my entire platoon to shreds. When I heard the screams, I buried my face in my hands and prayed. Guys in similar gear to what we wear now told me it was the only thing that saved me. Wouldn't say why." He finished, before looking down at the ground, his gaze never rising from his shoes for the rest of the conversation.

It was Dwyer's turn to tell her story. She began: "I was responding to an active shooter with the rest of my team. Mass casualty even at a mall up near the Tennessee state line." She paused, tears already creeping into the corner of her eyes. I can't help but think to myself now that she was *much too young* to have seen the things she's seen. "Turns out the guy didn’t even have a gun. He was just walking around, well, *exploding* people. As soon as our ambulance pulled into the parking lot behind the line of police cars, the front three cars blew up, throwing the ambulance on its side. I was knocked out and woke up under the care of a couple of guys waving... uh, well, I'm not really sure what they were waving over me, but it felt weird. My uniform was torn to shreds, but I was pretty much unhurt by it all. They were all *also* wearing these uniforms." She finished, pinching at the sleeves of her black utility top.

I decided to go next. I recounted my story, the same one I told you all in my first post; I won't bore you with a rehashing of it here.

"Seems like you got more working knowledge of this kinda thing than the rest of us, then, boss," Thatcher said.

"Eh? Not exactly." Holmgren started, in a thick Scandinavian accent, but was unable to continue his thought.

In that moment, a tall man with a German accent walked in carrying his clipboard tight to his chest, as if the contents were worth their word count in gold.

“I am Dr. Kruger," he introduced himself, "and I *already know* who all of you are. I'm sure you've made your introductions? Good."

He looked like he’d been built in a lab for intimidation: lean, silver-haired, wire-rim glasses that caught the glint of the fluorescent lighting overhead each time he turned to look at me.

He continued, “You are all here because you have survived direct Field exposure. You have shown resilience to its effects. Over the next two weeks, we will make that resilience useful.”

He paused long enough for Dwyer to whisper, “Guess that means hazard pay?”

Kruger’s eyes snapped toward her like radar. “Questions,” he said flatly, “are to be saved until the final day of training. Curiosity before competence is fatal. Understood?”

“Yes, sir,” we chorused.

Thatcher muttered, “Guy’s got the bedside manner of a hungry coyote.”

Kruger didn’t miss a beat. “Mr. Thatcher, when I want wit, I’ll requisition it from the comedy department. Until then, silence.”

Holmgren smirked beside me.

\---

Our first lesson felt like a physics course mixed with a sermon.

Dr. Kruger started with what he called resonance literacy. We stood in an observation deck, below us was a roughly circular room with three figures kneeling in the middle around a large metallic sphere not unlike the one I've seen in the chamber beneath the plant, with wires snaking out from it to three pillars forming an equilateral triangle around the sphere. Additional wires connected all three pillars, forming a circle around them. A thought crossed my mind as my pattern recognition kicked in:

***"I guess I know where they got their logo from."***

The experiment began when Dr. Kruger directed the kneeling figures below to begin chanting. The hum shifted immediately, changing several times,  rising and falling with the cadence of the chanting below; on monitors in front of us, graphs were mapping out frequencies consistent with the rise and fall of the hum. "Kyrie Field fluctuations," The Doctor said, pausing for a moment before continuing the thought, "some of you may have *also* noticed that a certain *feeling* coincides with these graphs. For some, it is a tingling in their skin, for others, it is an audible hum. For the most sensitive individuals, it is fire running through their veins and voices screaming in their heads. That is the Field acknowledging their presence.”

Miller crossed his arms and asked in a direct tone, “Acknowledging, not retaliating?”

Kruger’s gaze flicked to him. “It does not distinguish. The Field reacts to conviction. Belief harmonizes the reaction. Harmony is useful.”

Dwyer mouthed, "*Harmony is useful*", then, under her breath, said, "Sounds like a cult slogan."

Kruger explained the Kyrie Field like it was a living thing, taking in information and reacting to it in turn.

He had the kneeling figures read Bible verses, recite poems, speak gibberish, and spout seemingly random numbers, all while the lines shifted in response. He’d smile whenever the readings formed clean, harmonized wave patterns.

Thatcher leaned toward me. “They’re doing seances for science.”

“Shut up,” Holmgren hissed, suppressing a laugh himself, “he’ll hear you!”

Kruger glanced up from the console, his previous smile replaced with a scowl. “For your sake, Mr. Thatcher, listen to your teammate."

"Once again, questions may be asked on the final day of your training, before *practical application*. For now, you listen and you learn." Dr. Kruger said, giving us all another look of distaste. "Now get some rest, all of you. Your *real* training starts tomorrow."

\---

The next day was the "Dojo," where we would learn the tools of the trade. There was a noticeable absence of a certain overbearing Doctor at the beginning of the day.

First, they issued each of us a small silver cylinder the length of a baton, with a wider, paddle-shaped end opposite the handle. “Kyrie Field detector, nullifier, and destabilizer, all in one tool,” the instructor, who had introduced himself as Researcher Elliot, started, in a surprisingly American accent. "The official designation is \*KF-DND MK 5\*, but the other personnel have taken to calling them 'wands.' Sounds mystical, I know, but then again, they *are* on the cutting edge of field manipulation technology, and, well, I'm sure you know the saying." He finished.

*"Technology advanced enough is indistinguishable from magic,"* Dwyer said, almost in awe.

"Correct!" Elliot chirped.

"Can't say I blame them for the colloquialism, *KF-DND MK 5* is a mouthful and a half." Thatcher quipped

"Never said I did, it's certainly got a ring to it!" Elliot shot back without a pause.

The glint in his eye and the genuine passion with which he spoke led me to believe he probably had a hand in developing this "wand."

“This switch turns it on. It is always in detection mode when activated; it vibrates if pointed in the direction of anything above the baseline background KF reading, somewhere around 0.013 Hz. With that being said, anything *in* the Kyrie Field will also be able to detect the wand, even if it is powered off."

I wanted very much to ask *why* something in the Field would be able to detect it if it were powered off, but, as if he somehow had a radar on his head for misplaced curiosity, Dr. Kruger walked into the Dojo and gave me a bombastic side-eye as soon as the question crossed my mind.

"This bezel sets the power output, which increases or decreases detection range, and these two buttons cause either a localized nullity in the Kyrie Field or a concentrated burst of KF energy in the direction you're pointing it, respectively, the power of which is *also* determined by the bezel. For the buttons to work, you must grip the wand *here*."

He tilted his wrist to show us a depression in the wand where he slid his pointer finger into and gripped, almost as if pulling a trigger.

"Think of it as a *safety* feature. Your wand will be attuned to your biosignature after the first time you use it, and will need to be unattuned if it is to be transferred. You won't be able to use anyone else's attuned wand, and nobody will be able to use yours."

He demonstrated the burst feature by setting the bezel to about the quarter-turn mark and pointing the wand at a 50-gallon steel drum about 10 meters away, which instantly imploded into a crumpled ball roughly the size of a basketball and fell to the floor with a dull thud when he pressed the burst button.

"*Jesus Christ,*" Miller said, surprising the rest of us more than the spectacle we had just witnessed. He hadn't spoken a word since yesterday.

"You've taught the dumb to speak! It's a miracle!" Thatcher joked, slapping Miller on the back.

Dr Kruger noticed this outburst, and a genuine smirk curled across his lips before he turned around and walked back out of the dojo without a word.

Even Miller couldn't help but smile at the joke.

Elliot chuckled and continued with his explanation.

"The former doesn't have very much of an effect on non-KF anomalies with short-term exposure, but the *latter,* well... just use it with caution." He finished, enunciating the last two words very slowly. He looked us each in the eyes one at a time, his brows raised to emphasize what he was telling us.

"At the lowest setting, the burst Function on the wand can be used to rapidly heal wounds. Use this setting at your discretion; at the *highest* setting, you would be hard-pressed to find any trace of what you were pointing it at. This tool *can* and *has* leveled buildings before. They're set to training mode until you graduate for that very reason."

He looked over to his right. I followed his gaze to a corner of the training room, where a large gouge had been taken out of the wall and a bare, near-perfect hemisphere of missing mountain was visible behind it.

"Of course, we could repair this section of the dojo, but I believe it is more useful as a cautionary tale than an extra few square meters of floor space."

"So you're entrusting us with a hand-held combination of a bandaid and a nuclear detonator?" I asked, noticing that Kruger had not returned from his sabbatical to the hallway yet.

"Much more than a bandaid, and quite different from a detonator as well. The KF burst is capable of causing *implosions* more so than *explosions*." Holmgren said matter-of-factly. He seemed to be the only one with *any* insight into most of this knowledge that was being dumped onto us.

"Correct, Mr. Holmgren!" Elliot beamed.

"What kind of wounds are we talking? Like fixing up paper cuts, or closing up gashes?" Dwyer asked, genuine curiosity sparked in her eyes.

Researcher Elliot smiled at this and held up his left arm so that the sleeve of his lab coat fell past his elbow. He pointed with his right pointer finger to a faint white line around the meaty part of his forearm.

"So it closed up a wound you had there?" Dwyer questioned, looking confused at the grand gesture.

"It *regrew* his arm..." I said aloud, cautiously putting two and two together in my head and holding up my own hand, showing her the faint white line around a few of my fingers. "These fingers were gone, blown off by an electrical arc when... well, after an accident at work. My manager must have had something like this in his desk... He grabbed my hand and they just kind of... grew back."

"*Calloway Farms*, I presume, Edward? If so, the man you're referring to had no such device. No, that man has a *gift*." Elliot said, smiling.

\---

After the dojo, there was a period of time allotted for classroom training, where we went over the three distinct entity types, and which option on the wand worked the best against each of them. Dr. Kruger was our teacher, and we *weren't allowed* to ask questions per the usual, so I will summarize the lesson below.

To start, there are Non-Corporeal Entities (NCEs, for short). These are pretty straightforward: they are entities that exist within the Kyrie Field (often abbreviated as KF) without a physical form. While that doesn't necessarily mean that they are *invisible* to the naked eye, it does mean that they are way harder to spot than something that has a body, but that's where our *wands* come in.

Next up, there are Corporeal Entities. In short, Corporeal Entities (CEs, for short) have physical bodies that are capable of *directly* interacting with regular matter. There are two distinct *types* of CEs, depending on how they manifest. First, there are Type "A" CEs, which are when something in the Field concentrates a truly *massive* amount of KF energy into one physical location, basically giving the energy a solid structure. Kruger explained it as kind of a reverse of the \*𝐸=𝑚𝑐\*\*\**^(2)* formula you're taught in physics class. These tend to be incredibly powerful, but also are *usually* very short-lived, since they take so much energy to manifest.

The second type of CE, Type "B" CEs, are NCEs that have "possessed" a host, whether it be a person, animal, or inanimate object. Type "B" CEs usually aren't as powerful as the Type "A" entities are, but, from what the instructor was saying, they are theoretically immortal due to the way the NCE is capable of interacting with organic matter. Put simply, the NCE can rearrange the cellular structure of a person or animal to take the form of whatever it desires or needs at the moment, within the limits of that creature's preexisting mass. The only catches are that inanimate objects usually aren't capable of doing very much when possessed, and living things possessed by NCEs require food to sustain themselves, and will eventually go into an almost hibernation-like state when not fed properly.

Both NCEs and CEs possess varying levels of intelligence, from simple-minded predatory CE Type "B" entities that are too weak to hold a form outside of a host, to near omniscient NCEs that would be indistinguishable from Angels or Gods when they manifest.

\---

After this lesson in what quite literally felt like demonology, we learned which buttons on the wand work against which types of entities, and a brief working explanation of why it is that way, a team effort from both Elliot and Kruger.

The "Null" option was designed to give us an option to drive out non-corporeal entities that had taken on a living host. Think "exorcism," but with the added risk of permanent brain death, depending on how powerful the entity was that had taken hold, and how far removed from the original organism the entity had warped the body. We were warned this wasn't to be used as a first resort, since more braindead people meant more work on the back-end, where cleanup and cover-up came in.

It was explained to us that there were safer ways to drive out these entities that had much less risk of damage to the individual. In the case that the individual was already too far gone (as evidenced by gross deformity of the body, impossible body geometry, fatal wounds, etc,) we were told to still attempt capture if safe to do so, since a CE Type B could be used in conjunction with something called an "RDC and PRN array" system to create a relatively safe, self-containing power supply, as long as the thing was fed, of course.

That side of business was *supposed* to be out of our wheelhouse, left more to the lab-coat types, and it was only mentioned as an afterthought, but if you read the first part of my story, you'll understand why this whole situation suddenly started making *a lot more sense* after that was explained.

The second, more mundane but certainly still practical, use for the *Null* function was a cloaking device against NCEs, which detect the world around them through the Kyrie Field, and a shield against *most* NCEs and CEs alike. By holding the button down for a few seconds, while also holding the safety, a pocket of Null would be generated around the user that would hide the user from any entity without physical eyes, and anything that *could* see still couldn't touch the user without being forcibly removed from the host, but this shield had about a two hour time limit before it became unstable, and a 30 minute "cooldown" period before it could be reliably used again.

\---

Finally, we got to the fun button. The "Burst" button.  
We were given a few warnings in the dojo about the burst function of the wand, and we were given a few more now. Firstly, it was made \*very clear\* that the *Burst* function was ***not*** to be used on CE Type "A" entities, since, in Kruger's words, "It would be like throwing gasoline into a grease fire." The way the *Burst* function works would basically *supercharge* the entity and give it more energy to work with. Secondly, if the *Burst* function were to be used on a CE Type "B", we had to be ready to activate the shield immediately after, since the NCE inhabiting the body might try to escape into a nearby, *less damaged* body in the case that the one it was in is destroyed.

In general, the burst function was to be used against non-KF entities or physical objects. An example would be using the second tick up from the lowest setting on people who see things they aren't supposed to know about, and could go with having the last few hours of their memory erased. It isn't enough to cause permanent damage, but it is enough to knock out most people cold. Another, less *friendly* example, would be using it on a higher setting for self-defense. "The burst function is a newer addition to the wands," the instructor said, "Meant to replace conventional firearms in places where they would draw too much attention, or, in some cases, not be allowed at all."

\---

Before we concluded class on the day of the 23rd, we were shown a couple more tools that we would be using as a Quick Reaction Containment Team (QRCT, for short. Man, these people love their abbreviations.) The first was simple enough, a small, matte black card with the triangle-in-circle logo stamped on it in silver. This is what Elliot had to say about it:

"This is not as powerful a deterrent as the *Null* function on your wand, but it *will* protect against you being possessed or physically attacked by weaker entities as long as it is on your person. It also functions as a tracking beacon and mobile KF sensor, so should you need to keep *tabs* on someone, or protect them, give it to them or discreetly place it among their belongings."

The second tool we were shown looked almost like a smaller version of the metallic sphere I've come to know as an "RDC," or "Resonance Decay Capacitor." We weren't told much about the function or construction, once again out of our wheelhouse.

Elliot kept it brief (as brief as an overly caffeinated man, high on enthusiasm could be, I suppose), but explained well enough how it should be used: "This is a combination of a KF sensor and a Field nullifier. Most just call it a 'Field Sphere,' and it has no official designation yet, since it is still relatively new. Should you have to set up a forward operating base, this will prevent you from being attacked unawares by any entities drawn to you by your wand's signatures. It has a range of about 25 meters, but I'd strongly recommend you test this manually with your wands. The KF baseline inside of the protected zone will be zero, so by calibrating your wand and walking outwards from the Sphere, you should be able to find the boundaries of the zone by marking where your wands start detecting the normal baseline KF frequency again. The Field Sphere will also act as your primary generator; any auxiliary devices, the hab modules in your tents, for example, rely on it to work. The cables are plug-and-play."

We were dismissed for rest after we were given a demonstration on setting up the Field Sphere and how to read KF data on the monitor attached to it.

\---

Day three was a review day, where we went over everything we had learned in the first few days and were tested on it. Once again, Kruger was present, and his *no questions* policy was brutally enforced.

By the beginning of day four, October 24th, I was confident with my wand, could run diagnostics, set up the Field Sphere, read resonance maps, and identify manifestation precursors solely through the vibration pattern given off by my wand.

***I had questions, and I wanted them answered.***

Elliot met us that morning outside our rooms, *alone.*

"Are you ready for your practical exams?" He chirped with a jittery excitement.

"Does this mean we are *allowed* to ask questions now?" Thatcher said, looking around for Kruger as if he were going to pop out and scare us for showing the slightest sign of curiosity.

"Of course. What are your questions?" He shot back immediately, seeming no less excited.

"Where is Dr. Kruger? I figured he would want to be here to see us graduate." Thatcher questioned.

The look on the instructor's face shifted to that of disappointment, as if he were expecting us to ask the most profound, scientific question he had ever heard, and instead, we asked to speak with his boss.

"I.. I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher. Dr. Kruger flew out to Italy late last night. He said he had to be there to pick someone up for an important experiment in Sweden. Are there any... *other* questions you may have? *Any* of you?" The instructor said, looking like a puppy that had been left out in the rain.

"Actually, I do have a *few* questions I would mind having the answer to," I said. You could physically *see* the excitement return to our instructor's face.

"Go ahead! Ask away, no holds barred!" he almost shouted, as we began walking back towards the dojo.

"How do the wands work? Do we charge them, or-" I started, but was immediately cut off by the instructor, "An excellent question! Well, as you remember, the entities in the Field don't *just* possess people or anim-" He started, but was cut off by a loud yell from an office we were walking past.

"RESEARCHER ELLIOT." The deep, British voice was thunder rolling over an open field.

"Y..yes, sir?" our previously excited instructor responded, a mortified expression now plastered across his face.

"These are *Containment Team* trainees, and the information you were about to haphazardly disclose is intended only for *Field Application Researcher* grade employees and above. *PLEASE,* refrain from causing *another* information leak. You remember what happened *last time*, yes?" The booming voice came from the office, chilling all of us to the bone.

"Yes, sir. I remember." Researcher Elliot responded with a gulp.

"Then keep the information you disclose to *their* level." The voice finished.

"Yes, sir, will do, sir. Sorry, class. No more questions for now," Elliot said, looking as if those words escaping his lips physically pained him, and hurriedly directing us to continue with him to the dojo.

"And we thought Kruger was bad," Thatcher said when we were out of earshot of the office door.

"He isn't wrong... I do have a history of troublesome oversharing." Ellioy responded, the color slowly returning to his face.

\---

When we had just reached the dojo, Elliot received a call.

"Go ahead and get your FOB ready, I won't be far behind... let's say thirty minutes." Elliot chirped before ducking out and closing the door behind him.

"Time on deck is 08:37 CET, looks like we have a deadline of 09:07 CET. Let's get ready!" Miller said aloud, looking at the clock on the wall.

"Well, you heard the mute, let's get moving!" Thatcher said, already rolling out the Field Sphere and getting it set into its tripod base.

It was definitely a sight to behold, the little command center we had managed to build in just under the time limit Elliot gave us. It was about 20 meters in diameter, with the Sphere set up in the middle, "Where a flag-pole would normally sit," as Miller put it. We each had a small tent, a hab unit (combination high-efficiency heater and air conditioner), and surveillance equipment installed and ready for testing.

Elliot burst through the dojo door, face pale and holding a stack of folders."

“TL-13, congratulations. You and your QRCT are now activated,” he said, proudly, "Your team designation is now QRTC-US-13.

"Activated? I thought we were about to do practical application testing?" I asked, confused by the implications.

“Consider it an on-the-job deal now. Something came up within the sector your team was meant to be assigned to: the Southeastern US region. A suburban residence has been flagged for KF anomalies and unlawful human experimentation. The operator has historical ties to Penumbra, which was our predecessor.”

He slid the case file across to me. The cover read:

CASE: PIGG - 24102025  
LOCATION: REDACTED, GEORGIA  
STATUS: ACTIVE

I flipped the page. Photos. Dolls that we were told *weren't actually* dolls, appearing in the home's windows, with silver collars, and cables running from them into a console. Then a name in a witness log.

Grett.

“Witness is a neighbor,” Elliot said. “Gave us the tip through a cooperating officer. Your objectives: capture or neutralize the operator, secure all subjects, triage any CE Type-B, isolate any NCE presence, and maintain the veil. You will lead, Edward.”

“Type-B?” Dwyer asked, already packing her kit.

“Working theory,” Elliot said. “The operator is augmented or possessed, possibly both. Several subjects are still conscious. Time is not our friend.”

He handed me a matte black wallet. Inside was a gold-on-black credential I had never seen before, only heard about in whispers.

“Use it to clear the scene if there are any police already involved when you touch down. Do not debate with locals. If anyone sees too much, or refuses to leave, you know what to do.”

“Question,” Thatcher said. “Rules of engagement?”

“Minimal collateral. No Burst on Type-A under any circumstances. Try to capture the operator and all subjects *alive* if possible.”

Holmgren grunted. “Noted.”

Miller closed his eyes for a second, then nodded. “We’re ready.”

"Let's move, get the kit packed back up!" I commanded, getting to work myself, repacking the Field Sphere.

\---

We boarded a jet that I'm sure didn’t officially exist. I fell asleep somewhere on the ride and woke up as we were touching down at a small air strip that looked like it had been designed for crop dusters.

A trio of black vans was waiting for us when we touched down, keys already in the ignition, but no sign of who had left them.

Thatcher buckled in beside me and asked, “You think this guy knows we’re coming?”

“Let's hope he doesn't,” Dwyer said through the headsets we were wearing, “but if he's able to detect our wands like KF entities can, he will if we aren't careful.”

Dwyer was driving the van in the far rear of the convoy, while Thatcher and I took up the lead. Between us were Holmgren and Miller in the third van.

Holmgren's voice came over the speakers, “Local ambient is point zero one five and rising. Activating Field Sphere for KF cloaking.”

Two blocks out, we killed the headlights. Blue police lights flashed ahead, far too many for a wellness check.

"Looks like the boys in blue got here before we did." Thatcher quipped.

We rolled slowly and surveyed the mess. Patrol cars skewed across the road; they'd set up a perimeter all the way around the house. A few officers were on the ground, dazed but alive, one door torn off a cruiser and folded like a book.

“Super strength?” Thatcher whispered.

"Or he can burst, like that guy at the mall,” Dwyer said.

I activated my wand's shield and stepped out with the black wallet. The closest sergeant opened his mouth, then saw the credentials, closed his mouth, saluted, and then called for a full withdrawal of police presence.

"Feds are here; this is out of our jurisdiction now. We need to he gone NOW!" the police sergeant shouted, before getting into his own car and speeding away.

As the last cruiser fishtailed away, I looked up. A curtain twitched, but a face behind it remained still.

“Field Sphere here,” I said. “Now.”

Holmgren set it up on its tripod in the grass.

“Reading?” I asked.

“Zero within the zone, but something in the basement is emitting high-frequency KF signatures," the Scandinavian giant replied

Thatcher cracked his neck. “Should we take the basement door, or do you want me to make a new one?”

“Basement,” I said. “We don’t want to wake the neighborhood.”

Miller touched the black card in his pocket like a rosary. “And we don’t want to wake worse things.”

\---

The basement door was ajar. The smell of antiseptic and hot plastic, with an undertone of something sweet, wafted out through the opening.

“Keep the Field Sphere and your wand shields ready, but leave them off for now,” I said quietly. “Let’s move.”

We floated through the museum of smiles and sundresses. Posed, polite, somehow wrong. Silver collars glinting with a soft pulse.

Holmgren pointed with his wand. “Spike detected ahead.”

Thatcher took point. I followed, with Dwyer and Miller close behind, as Holmgren took rear guard outside with the Shere.

Rows of them. Wires like veins snaked into a console that pulsed three-pause-three. Many blinked. A few breathed. And at the end of the row, looking at us directly, was one I recognized from the file.

The diner uniform, the bracelet, the brown hair.

Lydia. The witness's sister.

A voice spoke behind us; I don’t know how he moved without a floorboard complaining.

“Please don’t touch *her*. She's my favorite.”

Mr. Pigg was smaller than the strength he had shown. A worn cardigan smeared with blood and shrapnel, kind eyes that had learned to lie. His hands were empty, which felt worse.

“Sir,” I said softly, “step away from the subjects.”

“She volunteered,” he said, almost tenderly. “They all did. I fixed them. I fixed what time breaks.”

Thatcher slid a half step left. “And what did you fix yourself with?”

Pigg smiled like he was receiving praise. “Patience.”

He moved too fast for a man his age. Thatcher went to tackle him, but Pigg dodged, and he hit a brick wall \*hard\*. I hit the shield button without thinking. The null bubble snapped around us; his hand hit it and stuttered like a bird striking a window, and the two \*dolls\* closest to us slumped over and fell to the floor.

He blinked, the smile fading from his face for the first time, “That was rude, stranger. You won't live to regret that.”

“Dwyer,” I said, never taking my eyes off him, “secure the subjects. Check airways and blink responses. Miller, start working on getting those collars off.”

“On it,” Dwyer said, beginning to pull figures up and out of the basement as the collars clicked off.

Pigg lunged again, but slower, reading the bubble. He ripped the leg of a workbench off and brandished it. Augmented, possessed, or both, it didn’t matter; he was a \*serious\* threat. The wand in my hand trembled against my palm.

“Sir,” I said, “I’m going to detain you, then I’m going to help them. You can make it easy on yourself if you give up now.”

He smiled again, proud. “You’re too late. I already made it easy on myself.”

Holmgren called, “Edward. Console’s detecting resonance. He’s got some kind of RDC knock-off storing energy from \*resonance decay\* down there.”

“Can you nullify the circuit?” I asked.

“Not without leveling half of this city. Energy reading is enormous.” Holmgren yelled back.

Pigg tilted his head at me, curious. “You know a lot, stranger.”

He moved for me again. I dropped my shield for just long enough to hit him with a burst, but he was too fast. The impact of the piece of wood against my arm and side sent me flying, and sent my wand spinning out of my hand in the opposite direction. I could tell immediately that my arm, and probably most of my ribs on my right side, were broken.

Thatcher had regained his footing and sent a burst at Pigg, center mass. It was a direct hit. Pigg's body folded in on itself for a heartbeat, and then he was on the ground, breathing ragged. Not dead, but certainly done fighting.

“Restrain,” I said, coughing up a not insignificant amount of blood in the process. "Restrain and cage him."

Thatcher zipped his wrists with an alloy strap from the toolkit and double-looped his ankles. Pigg laughed once, oddly delighted.

“Smart,” he said. “You learn fast.”

Dwyer’s voice cut the hum of the basement. “Edward. We got the ones with lifesigns stabilized, all except the witness's sister, but none of them are conscious besides her.”

"What about Lydia? I mean, what about the witness's sister?" I asked through the pain.

"We can't get the collar off; the cable is actively feeding energy into it," Lydia remarked.

“Holmgren?" I choked out.

He ran a wand along the cable. “There’s a carrier tone riding the power. Null the cable on my mark, then you lift.”

Miller stepped beside Lydia and put the black card into her palm. “Hold this, Lydia,” he said gently. “It’ll help keep you... Well, *you*.”

Her fingers spasmed, closing around it like a reflex she’d been waiting to have. The hum hiccuped.

“Mark,” Holmgren said.

Miller hit Null at a hair above minimum, and Dwyer pulled the cable free in one smooth motion. The collar’s pulse died. Lydia exhaled, as if waking from a nightmare.

“Airway clear. Pupils responsive. She’s in there,” Dwyer said, and swallowed hard.

Dwyer moved to me as soon as she noticed my crumpled form on the floor.

"Edward... I heard the hit, but I had no idea you got it *this bad*." She said, moving aside my shredded uniform and putting her wand against my rapidly bruising chest.

"You'd better have that thing on the lowest level, unless you're prepared to be wearing *Edward soup*." I joked, trying to make light of the pain. The sensation that followed was unreal. I could *feel* bones shifting back into place, muscle and cartilage repairing themselves. Next, she ran the wand up my arm, where a similar sensation occurred.

"See? No Edward soup." Dwyer smiled and helped me to my feet, pulling me into a hug.

We moved fast after that. Each subject triaged: who blinked, who focused, who sobbed without moving. We tagged, logged, and loaded as gently as it was possible to load board-stiff people into vans. 

When the first cages rolled up the basement stairs, a shadow shifted in the front window of the house across the hedge. I saw him, just a guy, face familiar from the briefing documents.

It was Grett.
