If you’ve read Parts 1 and 2 (which I will link in the comments), then you know that Room 409 isn’t just haunted — it’s sentient. It doesn’t trap you the way you’d expect. It lets you leave so you can unravel in the places you think are safe. I thought I escaped. I thought wrong.

------------------------

I opened my eyes and found myself back in the bed within Room 409.

The sheets were tucked like a nurse’s apology. Sunlight poured in through cracked blinds. Outside—birds chirped. Somewhere far away, the smell of fresh coffee wafted through a hallway that shouldn’t exist.

Everything felt normal — which is how I knew it wasn’t.

The wallpaper didn’t breathe. The mirror didn’t whisper. The notebook was gone. The silence was polite.

It felt like a dream trying to pass as a memory.

I stood. My coat hung on the back of a chair—clean, pressed, unscarred. I slipped it on. It fit too well.

For a fleeting second, I almost believed I was free.

Downstairs, the lobby was quiet. Empty. No mildew. No static hum in the vents.

Just sunlight.

I stepped outside.

The air was sharp and fresh, no longer polluted from the scent of the sky bleeding rain. My car was waiting, and my keys found their way into my hand out of instinct.

The engine purred to life as I drove past blinking stoplights, past kids with backpacks, and shopkeepers sweeping sidewalks. The kind of world where tragedy only lives in newspaper headlines.

It felt like waking up from an unfathomable nightmare.

Maybe that’s what I wanted all along, to believe this was just a dream.

⸻

At some point during my drive, I decided to stop off at a gas station to use the restroom.

The water swirled red as I washed my hands. Not blood. Something older. Remembrance?

I looked up.

My face smiled back. Rested. Too rested. Like grief had been ironed out of all the pores of my skin.

I forced a smile. The reflection held it longer than I did.

Then—behind me:

“You left me.”

My heart stopped.

I turned.

Empty bathroom stalls. Silent.

Except one was ajar.

Wet, child-sized footprints trailed from the tiles.

Back in the mirror—

Mr. Grey sat on the counter behind me.

And my reflection?

It didn’t move.

It just watched me.

Disturbed by what I was experiencing, I left the bathroom in a panic. 

I didn’t know what to believe anymore…

⸻

The drive home was uneventful but ephemeral.

I was just happy to be in the outside world again and away from that dreaded place.

I placed the key in lock of the door and noticed that the lights were already on.

My apartment looked rather immaculate. The couch, dishes, and books were all pristine and organized appropriately.

I noticed one particular photo on the wall though; one I was sure I had taken down months ago.

My little girl, holding Mr. Grey.

I turned toward the dining table and noticed that the journal from the hotel was there.

No dust. No reason.

Just resting out in the open, as if it were anticipating my arrival.

I didn’t touch it, not yet.

My phone buzzed softly as I reached down to grab it.

The screen was lit up with the notification of a new voicemail.

I didn’t remember calling anyone.

I pressed play and began listening with fearful eagerness.

I heard my voice speaking, but...it also wasn’t mine.

It was flat, lifeless, eerily mechanical. It was like someone was reading from a script with complete disinterest in the subject matter.

“I’m home now. It’s safe here. I’m better now.”

I deleted it and thought that was the end.

But then it returned. Same timestamp. Same flat voice. Like it had never left.

As quickly as I deleted these voicemails though, they would appear in my inbox again and again.

No matter how many times I tried to delete it, it would come back.

I eventually chalked up my endeavors as fruitless and walked to the bedroom where a lamp glowed somewhat ominously in the corner.

Blue.

The exact shade she liked.

And beneath the lighting, sitting cross-legged was the girl in the photograph with Mr. Grey.

It was Emily, my little girl…my daughter.

She didn’t move and she didn’t blink.

She just sat underneath the glow of the lamp as if she were in a period of stasis.

But when I whispered her name, she looked up.

“I didn’t want to go alone,” she spoke in a hushed tone.

Her voice was purely air, barely more than a faint breath.

I stepped closer, my knees shaking. “You weren’t alone, Emily…”

She shook her head. “Yes, I was…you left me in the dark.”

“I didn’t want to see you suffer anymore honey...” I whimpered, fighting the tears that threatened to trail down my face.

“Why did you do this?”

She reached out and touched my fingers.

They were warm…real.

And then as quickly as she appeared…she was gone.

Like she’d never been there.

The lamp flickered, black and blue pulsating the room briefly before the colors surrendered to the darkness. 

I screamed into the mattress, begging internally for a god that I didn’t even know existed to release me from this agony.

No sound came out, just a heavy and sustained breath of emotional turmoil.

The weight of everything I never said.

⸻

Things started unraveling the next morning despite the world pretending again.

I brewed my coffee, made some breakfast, and watched TV in the living room.

I did my best to block out the previous day’s events, but no matter what I did it seemed like my mind constantly gravitated back towards it.

I finished up watching a random program and went to go wash my dirty dishes when I felt like a pair of eyes were upon me.

It felt like I was being watched by someone, or something.

I looked around but didn’t see anything except the journal, the one from Room 409 on my dining room table.

I walked towards it and noticed that it was open.

It only had one line written across the page:

“How many times will you bury her to protect yourself?”

I slammed it shut.

The leather felt like melted flesh against my hand as I threw it across the room.

I watched in pure astonishment as it vanished in mid-air.

That was the first of many things that I couldn’t begin to explain:

•	In the bathroom mirror, I watched myself walk away. Another time I saw my reflection smile when I didn’t.

•	A girl on the sidewalk whispered, in my daughter’s voice, “I still remember you.”

•	The sound of peeling wallpaper buzzed behind my teeth.

Most disturbingly though, the journal followed me no matter where I went. I couldn’t get rid of it either. I would throw it away, tear it apart, set it on fire, but it always came back to me in immaculate condition. 

In the fridge, in the mailbox, in the cabinets… 

It was always soaked in red ink and each time it reassembled itself, new words would be carved into its pages.

“You didn’t survive. You split.”
“He’s wearing your face now.”
“The Room didn’t trap you. You brought it with you.”

The words haunted me even behind my eyelids, to the point that I stopped trying to run away or destroy it.

One night, I dropped to the floor beside my bed and reached under it.

The journal was there because of course it would be.

Every page had been written in, but not by my own hand.

By Emily’s.

Drawings, scribbles, all the stories we never finished. Things she might’ve whispered to me if she had more time to.

My eyes fell upon the words inscribed on the final page:

“You thought healing meant pretending but healing means feeling. And you won’t let yourself.”

Her scent suddenly infiltrated my nostrils. Shampoo. Baby powder. The hallway after bath time.

Three knocks slowly reverberated throughout the room.  

Not from the door, but from inside the closet.

I turned. I already knew it was waiting.

I opened the door and the dark inside breathed out.

The closet wasn’t a closet.

It never had been.

It was an invitation shaped like absence.

I stepped inside and the dark swallowed my vision.

Hands brushed old coats, cardboard boxes. For a second, I thought maybe—just maybe—I’d imagined it all.

Then the floor shifted.

Not in weight, but in memory.

⸻

Suddenly, I found myself in a hallway.

It wasn’t mine nor the hotel’s.

It was…somewhere between.

The carpet was the color of faded red, like wine was spilt violently onto it. The wallpaper was a vine-green and seemed to sprawl endlessly. 

My ex-wife Claire picked it once, before we knew what kind of grief waited in the walls.

The hallway stretched in both directions – unending, dream-warped. It was infinite but familiar, like grief that forgot where it began.

There was no closet behind me.

No apartment.

Only this place.

I reached out and traced my fingers slowly along the wall. It pulsed—like it remembered me.

In the wallpaper: faint etchings, a child’s drawing, a hospital wristband.

A courtroom door?

This wasn’t a hallway, it was a map.

A map comprised of everything I’d refused to remember.

⸻

Doors lined the hallway like soldiers waiting to take orders.

They bore no numbers, only marks and symbols of various kinds.

A handprint. 

A burn. 

A crayon sun.

I opened the first door and stepped into Emily’s room.

Not a version of it.

It was her room, exactly how it had been.

And standing in the corner, in her unicorn pajamas…was Emily.

She didn’t look up. Instead, she just moved her thumbs like she was texting someone far away.

“Sweetheart?” I cautiously inched towards her, uncertain of what could potentially transpire.

She didn’t answer but rather kept moving her thumbs.

I stepped closer, the air thickening like a blanket of sorrow wrapping itself against my skin.

“I’m sorry,” The apology leaving me like a gasp. “I never stopped missing you. I just didn’t know how to carry it.”

She looked up with tired, bloodshot eyes.

They weren’t angry, but rather glassy with disappointment.

“You left me in the Room.” She murmured with child-like sadness.

“I didn’t mean to—”

“I waited.”

Her interruption made my blood turn to ice. She had never been that way with me before.

I reached out for her, but she evaporated like a mist.

I was left stupefied, nothing but the air and silence to offer me comfort.

The door to the room was gone now too.

Only the walls remained now.

For a moment, I knew how Fortunato felt - walled in, forgotten, sealed behind silence.

⸻

Eventually, the door to the room manifested itself again.

I opened it and I began walking down the hallway to navigate my way out of this hellscape I found myself in.

Door after door appeared, what awaited me on the other side was emotionally heavier than the last.

An empty hospital corridor that felt cold like a morgue.

Claire crying in a car, her body shuddering violently with grief.

My mother’s silence when I told her the machines were being turned off.

The Room was a map with each grief serving as a landmark.

Each memory was a trapdoor.

And it kept building out of me, like vines on an abandoned structure.

I stepped through the last door, the hallway’s shape already forgetting itself behind me. Its impermanence pressing down like a weight I couldn’t carry.

Home awaited me on the other side.

Sunlight beamed through the kitchen windows as I was greeted with the faint smell of toast and coffee.

As I was walking around the kitchen, my phone buzzed.

A notification revealed that I had received a message from Marla:

“You’re slipping again. The Room’s getting in.”

How could she have contacted me? I wasn’t sure she even existed.

The message disappeared seconds later and was instead replaced by:

“Come back before it keeps more of you.”

I placed my phone back in my pocket, my eyes falling upon the journal that waited nearby on the table.

It was open and in Claire’s own handwriting it said:

“You loved us. But you hated what it made you feel. You buried her so deep, you forgot where you left her. That’s why it can follow you. Because part of you never left that room.”

Below that, smaller ink:

“We’re not ghosts. You are.”

⸻

Later, I walked to the park in an attempt to clear my head.

The sun was warm; the sound of children’s laughter and swings creaking filled the air.

It almost felt real.

Almost.

Until—

“Dad?”

I turned.

Emily was standing near the swings with the other kids.

She was alive and smiling.

Not spectral. Not wrong.

Just… her.

I approached, a smile finally making an appearance. “Emily?”

She softly nodded. Behind her, every swing creaked – perfectly, in unison.

The other kids were gone.

The sky blinked in almost strobe light effect like it was forgetting how to hold its shape.

The grass warped until it found its identity again as…the hotel carpet?

The tree bark twisted into plaster.

The world morphed and reality seemed to break all laws of known physics known to man.

As everything began to settle, I realized I was back in Room 409.

It was as if I’d never left.

⸻

The journal was on the desk again.

But this time, the words weren’t written.

They were spoken — Claire’s voice rising from the pages like breath fogging glass:

“You keep trying to go forward with parts of you missing. But the Room doesn’t forget. It keeps what you try to leave behind.”

I looked in the mirror.

I was asleep.

Even though I was awake.

My reflection breathed. I didn’t.

It blinked.

I didn’t.

Behind me—

The closet creaked open, looking more like a casket than an invitation.

The Room let me run. But it knew I’d built it myself.

It wasn’t done with me…because I never stopped needing it.

Room 409 doesn’t keep you…it becomes you.
