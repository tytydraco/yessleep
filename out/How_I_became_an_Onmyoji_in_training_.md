I'd moved to Japan from America in the hopes of a fresh start and an escape from the endless politics, though in truth that was just what he told people, it was the truth, but there was another reason, I've been in an online relationship for the last four years.

My parents didn't know about us, he was sure they suspected, he tried to bring up the idea once they shot that down before I could finish my sentence, seemed they think hearts belonged with hearts and spades with spades. But I'm an adult and I am going to live my life.

Inari was a beautiful young college woman who has been studying among other things, to be a veterinarian.

I looked around as I walked through the airport, I spotted what I was looking for and smiled as I approached a woman with a sign, it had my name Jason written in kanji. I saw Inari's face brighten when she saw him and they walked up to each other. "Hey, Good to finally meet you in person." I said, holding out my hand, it was an awkward gesture, which was strange, I've known her for years why can't I just give her a hug?

She laughed and grabs his hand, pulling him in to a hug. "It's good to meet you too Jason."

I let out a chuckle of my own and wrapped my arms around her. "How have you been?"

"Great, my parents can't wait to meet you." She said, releasing him. "Come on."

Inari lead me to a car and we drove, the traffic was pretty bad, at least until we got out of Tokyo after getting out of the city things calmed down.

It took a long time to drive out of the city and into the country side. He looked out the window as they rode together. At some point they passed through a large open field, houses dotted on hills in the background. There was a large temple on top of the hill.

Inari pointed to the temple. "My father works there."

I raised an eyebrow. "Wow, he's a monk?"

"Kind of." Inari said, returning her eyes on the road.

I frowned. "Kind of?"

"It's complicated." She said, not elaborating.

"Hm." I grunted, looking back out the window seeing someone had put one of those whacky inflatable dancing tube men in the field, or... maybe a scarecrow. it was white and flapped in the wind, not very big though, maybe six feet tall.   I stared at it until we turned the corner and started driving up the hill. with the sunset in the distance it was kinda eerie, the way it danced in the shadows of the hill.

Five minutes later they drove up into the driveway, the sun was just setting at this point and he could feel his stomach rumble.

Inari put the car in park and she turned to him. "My parents are kind of strict on tradition, my last boyfriend got thrown out for not taking off his shoes when he entered."

"I'll be careful, can't be much worse than my parents." I said, my mood going down a notch or two.

"Here, here, it's best you give this to my mother." She gave him a bottle and a gourd.

"Wine?" I asked, confused.

"And sake for my father, it's a gift." She says. "It's custom to give gifts to the parents of one you wish to be together with."

"But I..." I was hesitant to take the gifts. "I didn't get those though..."

"You can pay me back for them." Inari said smiling.

I sighed, nodding. "I get the feeling you didn't skimp on it. How much?"

"About seventy million yen." Inari said merrily.

"Okay, how much in united states dollars, I haven't converted my currency."

"about five hundred." She said causing me to nearly crap my pants.

"Yeah, here." I counted it out and gave it to her.

She took it and nodded. "Let's go, can't leave them waiting."

We walked into the house, and kicked off our shoes by the door.

An older man with his greying hair tied back looked out from a kitchen and smiled. "Ah, Inari-san you're back, you brought company as well I see."

"Yes, this is Jason, he's my boyfriend." Inari said, I noted a little challenge in her voice.

"Ah I see, Hinata, we have company!" He says in a raised voice, before turning back to me and introducing himself. "My name is Goro, It's good to meet you Jason.

"It's good to meet you too sir." I said, offering him the gourd. "We picked you both up something."

"Ah, my favorite, my daughter must really want to keep you." Goro chuckled. "Come, My wife will be down in a bit, for now help me set the table."

We started to set down plates and bowls of food, there was quite a bit of food for someone expecting three people. I frowned. "I see you made a bit extra."

Inari looked nervous but Goro cut in. "I eat a lot." He explains, a smile on his face.

I nod looking at the older man, he was relatively fit for his age, and that would probably require him to get more food than the average old man.  "Alright." I say, smiling at him.

A woman about Goro's age came into the room. "Oh, company, Goro-san, why didn't you tell me?"

"I did, forgive Hinata, she's hard of hearing." Goro said, putting a hand around her waist.

I nodded finishing putting the dishes on the low table and walked over to the counter where I left the bottle of wine, I handed it to Hinata after she sat at the end of the table. "This is for you."

Her eyes widened a bit. "Oh my, Inari must really want to keep you. Not that I blame her." Hinata said, a sly smirk playing over her wrinkled face.

Inari seemed to fold in on her self from where she sat. "Moooom." She complained.

"Oh, come now, can't I tease my own daughter?" She asked.

"Come now, it's time to eat." Goro said interrupting the pair, sitting down and waited for the rest to sit before putting his hands together and said. "we humbly recieve"

We repeated the phrase before starting to eat. As we ate we talked, discussing things, and at a few points I thought I saw flaps of white cloth out the window from the corner of my eye, though when I looked up I didn't see anything.

"Jason, have you considered what you will do here for work?" Hinata asked, a smile crinkling her old face.

"I'm not sure yet. I plan on doing some job hunting tomorrow." I said, scratching the back of my head. "I'm more than happy to help with chores and other such things until I get my feet under me."

"Of course dear." Hinata said, smiling.

"You can have the guest room." Goro said, giving me a stern look.

I blinked, then realization slapped me across the face and heat rushed across my face and I started nodding emphatically. "Of course."

He felt his phone vibrate and he took it out of his pocket and looked at the text. 'When everyone goes to sleep, look under your bed.'

I frowned and looked at her but she had gone back to eating.

"No phones at the table please." Hinata asks politely.

"Right, sorry." I put my phone back into my pocket.

"I notice you've not touched your rice." Goro says, looking at my plate.

"Never really liked rice." I say, looking at my plate as well.

"You might want to change that if your going to live in this country." Goro says, was that... mirth in his voice.

"I know, I'll try." I say, taking a bite of rice, I don't know how, but Goro actually made it... edible, good even, and the pork in the rice made it better. "How the-"

"Family secret. nearly anyone who tries it finds it's to their liking." Goro said smiling.

I smiled and took another bite, it's a strange feeling, eating food you don't like and loving it.

after dinner finished Goro had me help him with dishes, as we washed he told me a little of the temple, apparently it had been in his family for seventeen generations, or in his words, since before the Edo period, it had burned down during the Sengoku period by a samurai clan called the Mochizuki clan, apparently they had something against the Buddhist belief because they had a scorched earth policy when it came to them, they destroyed their statues, torched the scrolls, melted down their idles, and crucified any monks they caught over young bamboo shoots. Goro explained that they had been wiped out by one of the larger clans who'd caught wind of their actions.

"How did the monks survive the attack?" I asked, rather enjoying the story.

"The monks of the monastery got word of the Mochizuki's attacks, so they prepared a hidden cave beneath the hills cliff face where they hid their most precious artifacts and supplies so they could hide down there for years, when they got word of the Mochizuki clans imminent approach, they took cover beneath the cliffside, all they did was burn down an empty temple, and when the clan was defeated and the war ended they went back up, and rebuilt." Goro explained, rinsing off a plate.

"I've never heard of this clan." I said, frowning. "I mean, I've not read much history on Japan but, that sounds like a rather big deal people trying to wipe out an entire religion."

"Many of the monks thought it would be better to forget the clan ever existed, many at that time were angry, and thought if they tried to wipe us from history, it's only fair we do so to them." Goro explained.

"Then how-" Goro cut me off explaining. "History is precious, good or bad, it's only right to preserve it, so we have."

there was a silence between us, Goro patted me on the back, getting my shirt wet. "You can go to bed, I'll finish the dishes." He gave me a gentle smile and I returned a nervous one. "First room to the right." He said.

"Thank you sir." I said, starting to walk into my room, I swear I saw something flap around one of the corners, white cloth again, I shook my head, it's been a long day, a pleasant day, but quite long. I was ready for bed.

I opened the door, and saw a rather room that clearly was almost never used. I practically face planted on the futon, the soft fluff of the cold white blankets a welcoming embrace.

I woke up to a sound at my door, I wasn't really that heavy of a sleeper, hell I typically wake up when people walk outside of my room. I took out my phone and looked at the time, 4 AM, god this was going to chafe on my sleep schedule. I was pulled out of my useless ruminating when I saw something coming from under my door, a pair of streams of... white paint? glue maybe? I couldn't tell, as it was dark, so I shook my phone and the light came on, I pointed it at whatever was coming under the door and felt my heart stop, it wasn't paint, and it sure as hell wasn't glue, it was a pair of hands, flat as wash cloth and white as a sheet, okay, Inari maybe pulled a prank on me and pushed some long white gloves through the door. what I saw next confirmed it was no joke, hair, short and black peaked through the door, followed by a forehead and empty that somehow seemed to defy the laws of physics as they seemed so deep I couldn't see the back of them, yet were on a head maybe a centimeter thick.

I stopped gawking and got to my feet, and burst the door open running over it like it was a carpet, it shrieked as the wood of the door caught on its skin and moved it causing it to wrinkle like a towel as it was bunched against the wall, I ran over to where I thought Inari's room was and found it had some kind of sticky note on it, only, I've never seen sticky notes glow in the dark before, especially not that brightly, I tried to grab the doorknob and found my hand stopped an inch from the door, it was like someone put plexiglass between my hand and the door, that and the note glowed brighter.

I looked around and found another door I presumed to be Goro's door to also have that sticky note on it. what was worse I saw the creature standing up, it's arms flapping in some unseen wind as it's 2d torso twisted and writhed. I cursed and looked around for any exit, I saw a pair of branching hallways, I remembered the house had two stories at the least and if i remembered correctly, there was hall that lead back to the dining area and from there the front door is.

I ran into the kitchen and stopped, could I leave, could I leave with the my girlfriend and her family in this house, what if this creature attacked them. my beating heart told me to get out of this house and damned be the consequences, but that same heart told me I'd never forgive myself if I did.

I turned my head seeing the wrack of kitchen knives, took a pair out of them, trying them out, they were quality blades, the metal thick and the blades kept keen. I turned seeing the creature coming around the corner, it's two dimensional body flapping like paper in the wind.

I screamed and ran at it with the kitchen knives, the blades punctured it and I slammed them against the wall the blades driving themselves into the wooden wall.  it noiselessly shrieked,

it's arms wrapped around mine like paper snakes though I managed to back up and flailing my hands. it struggled against the blades, and I saw it was beginning to get free by tearing it's own skin. I ran back to my room, I thought I remembered something, and I briefly saw it on my phone when I used it as a flashlight, the text message, 'When everyone goes to sleep, look under your bed.' I flew into my room and slid onto the floor next to my bed. I saw a small snow white blade, a Wakizashi. I snagged it I didn't know what it was supposed to do but it looked important enough. I grabbed it, and saw paper wrapped around the sheath, 'Kill the Kunekune.'

I unsheathed the blade and it had a light bluish tint almost seemed to glow, no... that wasn't right, it reflected things even though it was extremely dark in the room. I could see the thing in the reflection it was moving through the door, and I spun swinging the blade wildly, it twisted back, it's face showing terror when faced with the blue blade, it spun back and I felt a bit better, I swung it again this time the blade hit it's arm and it cut through the skin and a glowing blue streak appeared on it's arm this time it's shriek wasn't silent, it howled like a creature, and flung itself at me, it bit down on my shoulder it's once pitch black mouth turned into that a lamprey, it bit down this time causing me to scream.

I plunged the blade through it even as it wrapped it's remaining limbs around me, I ripped the blade down.  and the creature went limp, it twitched, but a few more stabs caused it to fall still. I took a step and collapsed.

I was woken up to an increasing pressure on my shoulder. I winced and tried to sit up, only to be shoved back down gently but firmly. I opened my eyes to see I wasn't in the house anymore, but somewhere far nicer. it was open and and there were lanterns lighting the area, a large statue of the Buddha loomed above us, it's hand showing palm outward as if asking me to stop and stay a while.

Somewhere close by I could hear Inari and Goro arguing, Hinata stood over me as she dressed my wound.

"Don't be too bothered, Goro's not happy with you using his Wakizashi, he wanted you to survive the night." Hinata explained. "But you did kill it, and you absorbed some of it's ki. And your the first who didn't run out of the house."

"The first?" I asked, a cannon ball forming in my gut.

"That was a Kunekune, a Yokai that can make more of itself out of the skin of its victims. that one was a boy named Yoshimura, he was an ex of Inari's, he tried to run and died at the bottom of the hill, your the third we've tried to recruit, and the first to survive, so-"

"I could have died!" I practically shouted, I tried to sit up and felt dizzy.

"You can die driving a car, or walking across the street." Goro said, as he walked out of the other room followed by a fuming inari. "This was no different."

I ignored my dizziness as best I could and wobbly got to my feet, and threw a rather clumsy punch at Goro, he stepped on my foot and grabbed my arm by the wrist, before driving my backwards and I fell back onto my back, as gently as someone could when throwing someone to the ground. I grunted as I hit the floor and groaned, before gasping as a knee pressed onto my chest.

Hinata yanked Goro off of me. "He is injured Goro!"

"He needs to-" He cut himself off and shakes his head. "Jason, rest, your training starts tomorrow."

I stared up at him, and pushed myself up to my feet Hinata helping me. "What makes you think-" I feel my jaw being forced shut by some unknown force and nearly bit my tongue.

I look at Hinata who's making some kind of hand sign, she shakes her head looking me in the eyes. "You will dear, this is bigger than you. Besides, now that you've absorbed it's ki you have a target on your back, the best bet you have of staying alive will be if you accept our training, and become an onmyoji, otherwise, walk out that door, I'll give you a week to live at the most."

I grow pale when I hear that, the thought of something else like that coming after me, well, it's not a prospect I like. I silently nod and she drops her hands, the force keeping my teeth together slackens like a rope and stretch my jaw. "Right." I go back to the bed I was laying on and try to sleep, it's a losing battle and I just end up laying there unable to drift off.

Eventually, the others went away, Inari coming back with some a pair of bowls of noodles and we ate in silence for a while, eventually she spoke up.

"Are you mad at me?" Inari asked, she didn't meet my eye trying to find some unknown secret in the depths of the udon noodles.

"I... don't think so, your the one who hid the blade right?" I asked.

"Yeah, it was my blade from when I became an onmyoji, I was twelve then, I was given that blade and slain a kappa that was trapped in a circle. when I was fourteen I fell in love with my classmate, my father said he wanted to meet him, said if he liked the Nagasuba he'd give his blessing for our courting to continue, what I did not know was he had bound a yuuki onna in the house, and after sealing our doors released it, he fled the house, authorities found him dead the next day severe frostbite all over his body. when I was seventeen there was another boy, this time knowing what was going to happen I asked my father if he'd atleast give the man a blade, he refused. Harashi died to an oni that crushed him on the freeway when he tried to flee in his car, authorities said he had gotten into a car accident, this time I forewent asking and just hid the blade under your bed, he's not happy, he'll take it out on you in training but he'll get over it eventually." She finished the story, and looked up at him, she looked distraught. "I couldn't lose another person like that, and with you getting serious about us, I know I should have just cut you off when you said you wanted to meet me, but..."

I shook my head. "I don't blame you, if you'd told me that your father would try to murder me by proxy when I got here I'd have probably laughed and came anyways, your not to blame, but uh, why didn't you call me after the others were asleep?"

"The seals on my room block all energy, good, bad, neutral, that includes electronic signals, hell, I used to get in trouble with my father for shoplifting, using talismans to disrupt the cameras from seeing me." She said, a little more brevity coming into her voice.

"really?" I asked, laughing. "what happens if I take a video of you when you have one active?" I asked, genuinely curious as to how this works.

"Me and my immediate area would glitch on the camera, I've heard cameras having their lenses burned from the more powerful charms." She explained, she showed me one of the sealing tags I saw on the door and the ink started to glow gold creating a dome of light around her.

I checked to see if I still had my phone, it was on a small desk next to my bed and I turned on the phone, sure enough, it was like looking at censored video footage, all blocky and pixilated. "Well, that is something..."

"Yeah, like i said, it can damage your camera so don't film too long." She says, deactivating the paper seal, it burst in flames and turned to ash.

"Well that seems... wasteful." I say, frowning.

"Don't scoff too much, it's sacred paper, long ago people considered the crafting of paper to be a sacred thing, now people use factories, not many make it by hand any more, my mother does, combine this with the ink we use and it can create some powerful talismans." She explained, she was going to make a good teacher when she got out of college.

"So why did it burn up?" I ask raising an eyebrow.

"It's paper, sacred as it is, it doesn't change the fact it's paper." She says with more than a little mirth in her voice.

"So... tomorrow, what can I expect from the old man?" I ask, feeling my stomach drop slightly with dread.

"You'll see." Inari says, a blood chilling grin coming across her face. "It'll be fun."
