I grew up in a small town where nothing ever really happened. Middle of nowhere, Preble County, southern Ohio. A place surrounded by cornfields on all four sides.

In high school, I worked at the local Skyline Chili a few days a week. I was the dishwasher, so most nights I was in the back, alone, up to my elbows in hot water. My days were routine — school until 2:30, gym, homework, clock in at 5, and work until around 10:30.

The summer before my senior year, I was the only dishwasher we had, which meant I was working seven days a week. It sucked, but the money was nice for a high school kid in 2015. By the end of one brutal week, I was training a new guy to take over so I could finally have a night off.

After my shift, I planned to crash at my buddy’s place with him and our other best friend. We were inseparable — always hanging out, roaming town, and causing harmless trouble. That part will matter later.

Before heading to their place, I ran across the road to Walmart to grab a soda. The parking lot was practically empty — it was almost 11 PM on a weeknight. I parked near the back for no real reason, just habit.

I sat there for a minute, enjoying the rare feeling of having the next day off. Then I got out and started walking toward the store. That’s when I saw her.

A woman came out of the automatic doors. Nothing unusual about that… until she got closer.

At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me — maybe from exhaustion. Plus, I wasn’t wearing my glasses; they always fogged up at work from the dish steam. But when she was about 20 yards away, I realized it wasn’t my vision.

She had no face.

No eyes. No mouth. No nose. No eyebrows. Just smooth, pale skin stretched flat where her features should’ve been.

She was short, clearly white, wearing a long dress that swayed with each step. My stomach twisted into knots the closer she got. She didn’t slow down. She walked right past me, crossed the road, and disappeared into the dark woods behind Skyline.

I stood frozen for a few seconds before snapping out of it and hustling inside Walmart.

That night, after telling my friends, I thought I’d put it behind me. But I couldn’t shake this creeping feeling. When I got home, the air in my room felt heavier, like something was pressing down on my chest.

I kept hearing faint whispers — almost like breath right next to my ear — but when I turned around, nothing was there.

I brushed it off as exhaustion until my phone buzzed with a notification — a picture from an unknown number.

It was a blurry photo of me… taken from outside my window.

I didn’t sleep well that night.

⸻

Later, I told my friends what happened.

They laughed.

Jake: “You serious? Bro, you been inhaling dish soap too long.”
Mark: “A no-face woman? Come on. We’re not that stupid.”
Me: “I’m dead serious, guys. I was ten feet from her.”
Jake: “Right. And I saw Bigfoot buying a lawn chair last week.”

They thought it was hilarious. I dropped it, but the feeling didn’t go away.

⸻

Weeks later, on a night off, Jake and Mark came with me to Walmart.

We saw her again.

Same pale dress. Same empty face. She passed us, cold and silent, moving toward the woods.

Jake’s voice was a whisper:

Jake: “…holy shit.”
Mark: “Dude… that’s her.”

We watched her go, hearts pounding.

That night, as we sat around, Mark said he felt like something was watching us constantly.

A few minutes later, the power flickered off.

The darkness felt suffocating. I swear I saw movement just outside the window — something pale and smooth.

We laughed nervously, but none of us slept.

⸻

For a week, we waited outside Walmart every night around 11.

Nothing.

But strange things kept happening.

My phone would randomly dial numbers I hadn’t called. When I answered, there was only silence.

Jake started hearing footsteps behind him at night — never close enough to see, always just out of reach.

Mark found muddy footprints leading to his back door one morning. No one was there.

⸻

Toward the end of summer, the three of us went to Walmart again late at night.

And there she was.

This time, we stayed back near the carts, following her quietly into the woods.

We stumbled into a clearing.

More faceless figures stood in a circle around a stone slab, their pale skin glowing faintly in the moonlight.

They didn’t speak or move — until they all turned and faced us at once.

Even without eyes, I felt their gaze like a physical weight.

Mark whispered,

Mark: “They know we’re here.”

Branches scratched at us as we ran blindly through the woods.

When we finally reached the lights of the parking lot, we didn’t look back.

⸻

Since then, the feeling hasn’t left me.

Sometimes, when I’m alone, I hear soft footsteps behind me. But when I turn around, there’s nothing.

My phone still gets weird calls — just silence.

And sometimes, late at night, I swear I see a pale figure standing across the street, just watching.

Waiting.

If you’re from around Eaton, Ohio — please stay safe. I don’t know what this thing is, but it’s not something you want to cross paths with.
