**The Tongue Ripper**

You’ve probably never heard of him, and that’s probably for the best. His name is whispered in shadows—a figure blurred between urban legend and grim reality.

His name, The Tongue Ripper, is disturbingly literal. He hunts those who talk too much, kidnaps them, and violently rips out their tongues. But he doesn’t kill them. Instead, he lets them go, leaving them to a life that will never be the same.

Over the years, the Tongue Ripper has started to gain traction. Stories of his victims have surfaced online; family members who took their own lives after having their tongue ripped out, others who ended up institutionalized, and others who simply… vanished. Everywhere he goes, he leaves a trail of silence and despair.

But where did the Tongue Ripper come from? Like all of us, he used to be a child. A boy with an unknown name, struggling with his words and fumbling over sentences. His troubles with speaking made him the target for the other children around him.

One day, he and his brother were playing upstairs. His brother snatched his toys and ran into the hallway. “Back!” the boy shouted; his speech clumsy.

His brother laughed mockingly. “Form a sentence, idiot, and maybe I’ll give them back.”

Tears filled the boy’s eyes. Furious and hurt, he screamed, “I hope you die!”

Moments later, their mother came up the stairs, scolding the brother for his behaviour and returning the toys. That evening at dinner, the boy’s bitter words came true. As the family sat there eating, his brother choked on a piece of food, his small hands clawing at his throat. Their parents panicked, trying desperately to save him, but it was too late. He collapsed lifeless onto the floor.

Grief was swallowing the household. His parents cried, while the boy sat paralyzed, convinced he had killed his brother by the words he spoke earlier that day.

After the funeral, he continued to blame himself for his brother’s death. His parents were left broken. For weeks, the house was silent—no laughter, no warmth. Just pain.

One night, the boy woke up from his dream with the urge to pee. He made his way to the bathroom but froze at the sound of angry voices downstairs.

“Mom? Dad?” he whispered as he took a glimpse downstairs. That’s when a strange man walked towards him. The boy’s father stepped forward to stop the intruder, but this led to an even greater disaster.

The strange man shot the boy’s father. The gunshot was deafening. His father’s lifeless body collapsed on the ground, his mother screamed in agony and horror. The man walked up to the boy’s mother, and repeatedly shot her in the stomach. She too, collapsed, gasping for air, as the last bit of life left her longues.

Meanwhile the boy watched, unable to move. The strange man ran out the house, and not long after the police arrived.

The boy, left orphaned and traumatized, retreated into himself. He stopped speaking altogether. It felt as though every word he spoke led to the death of those he loved.

In school, his silence became fuel for the bullies. When the teacher asked him to answer a question, all he could manage was “I— “; but it sounded more like a gasp for air. His classmates roared with laughter.

After school, wanting to go home after the horrible day, his bullies dragged him behind the school and started beating him.

That night, he snapped. Returning to his foster home, he locked himself in the bathroom. Rage boiled within him. He wished he had never spoken in his life. He grabbed his foster mom’s  hairdryer and scorched his tongue until it cracked and dried. Then, in a moment of pure madness, he ripped it out with his bare hands. Blood splattered everywhere before he passed out from the excruciating pain.

When he awoke in the hospital, his tongue was gone, and the damage was irreversible. But instead of despair, he found relief. Not having his tongue felt comforting to him. During his recovery, he couldn’t shake the feeling of wanting to rip out tongues. The feeling became an obsession.

Returning to school weeks later, he claimed his first of many victims. His first victim was one of the bullies that had beaten him up. He passed his bully a note to meet him in the school kitchen during break, promising a game console. When they were alone, the boy lashed out, slamming the bully’s head into a cabinet. He crushed the bully's jaw, forcing his mouth open to expose his tongue. Then, with a hairdryer, he dried it out before tearing it from his mouth

Afterward, he fled, never to be seen again.

Over the years, he became somewhat of an urban legend. Witnesses describe him as a man with a trash bag over his head, his mouth the only part visible. His victims are left mute, their tongues never found, rumored to be part of his twisted collection.

I’m telling you his story for one simple reason.

I used to be a talkative person. Too talkative, I suppose. One night, walking home drunk from a bar, I suddenly felt a hand covering my mouth as I was being dragged into the darkness.

That’s when my tongue got ripped out of my mouth. I was awake for every single part of the process. I woke up in a hospital, my tongue gone, my life in ruins. No amount of pain medication can alleviate the mental torment I continue to suffer. I beg you, please, be careful. I wouldn’t wish his actions upon my worst enemy.

This will be the last thing anyone will ever hear of me, because I can’t do this anymore. Mom, I’m sorry, I hope you can forgive me.
