I’m inside Pinecrest, a huge brick building that used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium. The state took it over and turned it into a barely liveable  nursing home, mainly for those who are a ward of the state. It looms gray and heavy, its walls chipped and cracked, floors stretching upward, some closed off, others leading to dark corners. Old cells with rusted bars line one hall, where prisoners with TB were locked away to contain the spread of the terrible disease in the jails and prisons. Past the B unit doors, a morgue sits silent and untouched.

I’m Jack, a nursing assistant on the night shift with my friends Destiny, Britney, and Josh. Nurses Pam and Beth are here too, tough from years of work and a permanent look of exhaustion from the majority of those years being night shifts. . The elevator moves on its own, creaking up to the fourth floor and back down. I watch the numbers, 4, 3, 2, waiting for the doors to open, wondering what might step out. It’s empty. This is the second time this has happened since I’ve been here.

Something feels off. Residents who can talk mention shadows on the empty floors, voices in the walls.Mr. Johnston is 85, frail, unable to move or speak. Tonight, Destiny and I hear a crash from his room. He stands, pacing, his eyes black. “Get out,” he growls in a voice not his own. We back off, call Pam and Beth. By the time they arrive, he attacks Mr. Carter, slamming his head against the bedrail. We lock him in an empty room until help arrives. His screams stop, and when we look, he’s dead, neck twisted, blood on the floor. It isn’t natural.

We try to explain it to the police and administrator, maybe a breakdown, but we know better. Then Josh runs up, pale, saying Ms. Brown, who has been paralyzed for years, sits up and tells him, “The devil’s gonna get you,” followed by a menacing laugh. I go with Josh to check on her and she’s asleep, peacefully, like nothing has happened. Other residents start doing it too, people who haven’t walked for years are suddenly roaming the hallways.

We smell smoke. Destiny and I run down the hallway to find the source. Why aren’t the fire alarms activating? When we reach the end of B unit, we see that the morgue is engulfed in flames. The flames spread unnaturally fast.. We try to get out, but doors won’t open, and the windows won’t break. Residents scream, trapped. Through the smoke, I see a tall shadow with black eyes moving in the fire. It’s been here all along, waiting for the right time, for the right souls. Destiny grabs my hand, scared. “Jack, what do we do?” The elevator dings, I can’t bring myself to turn around and look at what may be standing there. The fire closes in, the shadow laughing, taunting us, feeding off of our fear.

A shrill alarm jolts me awake, drenched in sweat. It’s March 22, 2025. I remember that I have a job interview today, but I can’t go, not after this. I call to cancel. A voice answers, “Thank you for calling Pinecrest, this is Beth, how may I help you?” My phone drops.
