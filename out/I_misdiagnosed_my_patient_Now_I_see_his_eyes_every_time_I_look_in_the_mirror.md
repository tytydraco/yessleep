I’m a doctor. A general practitioner.  
I’m trained to look people in the eye and tell them what’s real.

But for the past three nights, when I catch myself in the mirror, the eyes looking back aren’t mine.  
They’re watching. But not blinking. And not *mine.*

Last night, when I finally blinked, I felt something inside me… stay open.

This isn’t a joke, or a metaphor for burnout. I’m writing it at 2:17 a.m., bathroom light flickering, every mirror covered with towels and tape.

If it ends suddenly, it means they’ve figured out I’m trying to be seen.

His name was Marcus.

He was a psychologist before he became my patient. The first appointment seemed unremarkable — headaches, fatigue, disturbed sleep. But what stood out was the way he spoke. Precise. Clinical. As if trying to sound casual while measuring my every word.

He said, “It started after my client died.”

That caught my attention.

Marcus had lost a patient to suicide — someone he’d misdiagnosed as having a “narcissistic crisis” rather than major depression. The client took their life two weeks later. His notes were reportedly cold. Detached. He didn’t see it coming.

“I didn’t see it,” he told me. “And now I can’t stop seeing things I shouldn’t.”

I asked what he meant.

He lifted his glasses and said, “Look.”

His eyes looked normal. A little dry, maybe. No infection. No trauma. I noted *psychosomatic* in the chart and offered a referral to ophthalmology — just in case.

He didn’t follow up.

Instead, he came back a week later with a notebook full of drawings. Eyes in clusters. Eyes without lashes. Eyes embedded in skin. One sketch showed a face staring into a mirror — but the reflection was a blank skull with two wide, hovering pupils floating in black sockets.

“They’re watching through me,” he said. “I see things others don’t. But now they’re starting to see back.”

I asked if he’d had any hallucinations. He nodded.

“But only when I try to look away.”

I gently explained it might be trauma manifesting as visual disturbances — perhaps a complex grief response. I used the phrase *visual echo phenomena*, which I half-remembered from a psych seminar.

He didn’t argue. He just said, “You’re the second one who couldn’t see me.”

That was the last time I saw him alive.

Until last month.

An envelope arrived at the clinic. No return address. Inside: a letter, a photo, and a laminated form from a hospice facility.

The photo made my chest go cold.

Marcus — pale and hollowed — with *both eyes surgically removed.* Gauze packed into his sockets. Yet his expression was disturbingly peaceful. Not relaxed. Not gone. Just… still. Like whatever had been staring through him had finally left.

The letter wasn’t angry. It wasn’t even emotional. It read like an aftercare note.

*“They’ve stopped screaming,”* he wrote. “*But they haven’t stopped looking. They’ll need somewhere else to live soon.*  
*If they come to you, be honest. Mirrors make them angry.*

*You didn’t look when you had the chance.*  
*So now, they’ll look through you.*”

At the bottom of the page was his date of death. Three days before the letter arrived.

And one final line, barely legible:

*“What you refused to see will become your only vision.”*

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

The next morning, I noticed something in the bathroom mirror. A twitch. Not mine. My eye muscle moved in a way I’d never felt. Like a blink I didn’t initiate.

I leaned closer.  
The pupil didn’t contract.

I brushed it off. Exhaustion. Hallucination. A trick of light.  
I’m a rational man. I wanted to believe it.

But the next few days proved otherwise.

Photos on my phone: slightly altered eye shapes.  
Security footage: me walking through the clinic — without blinking.  
Patients commenting:

“You’re staring a bit hard, doc.”  
“Are you wearing different lenses?”

Then came the dreams.

In them, I watch people sleep. For hours. I can’t look away. My face feels stiff. Fixed. Like my skin is just the outer casing for something else that’s watching.

But the worst moment came when I stepped out of the bathroom last night.

The hallway was dim. Just enough light from behind to cast a clear shadow across the far wall.

I saw myself. Or rather — I saw the outline that should’ve been me. Arms at my sides. Chin slightly raised.

But it was *still*. Too still.

I moved. It didn’t.  
Then, slowly… deliberately… it turned its head — just a few degrees — as if noticing me watching it.

And it blinked.

Not a glitch of light. Not some eyelid illusion.

I saw **lashes** sweep down. One clean, unhurried blink. Like a lens testing its calibration.

I backed away, but my body felt out of sync — like I was following someone else’s lead.

That was the moment I covered every reflective surface in my flat. Even metal fixtures. The light distorts now. And in it, I sometimes see things twitch before I do.

I finally pulled Marcus’s file out again.

That’s when I found the page I’d never read — a clinical self-assessment Marcus had written in secret. About his client.

*“Patient displays hyperfixation on physical self-worth. Eyes are central focus of delusion. Appears to seek validation through being seen, then punished by it. Echoes of my own early fear of being perceived.”*

He had been diagnosing *himself*. Through someone else.

And I think he knew what was happening. That the eyes weren’t metaphor.

That they *migrate*.

That when someone refuses to witness what’s inside you, that *something else* will.

And it doesn’t go away.

I haven’t cried in days, but my eyes are never dry.  
They don’t close properly anymore. They sting when I try.

Because I think they’re not mine now.  
I think they’re his.

Or worse — *theirs.*

Tonight, I tried to FaceTime a colleague. Just to feel normal. But he froze mid-sentence and said:

“Is that a filter? Your camera’s not showing… you.”

I ended the call. Fast.

There’s a static hum in the back of my head now. Like an old slide projector stuck between frames.

I don’t sleep. I don’t blink.  
But I see everything.

Every lie. Every fracture. Every time someone avoids the truth.

I think that’s what they feed on — *avoidance.*

Marcus wasn’t mad.  
He was **open**.

He gave them an exit.

I didn’t.

I refused to see him — and now, I only see *him.*

If this post cuts out suddenly, don’t worry about me.

Worry about your own reflection.

Because the moment you stop recognizing yourself —  
That’s when they start watching through you.

And if you ever see a blink that isn’t yours?

Just remember:

**What you refused to see will become your only vision.**
