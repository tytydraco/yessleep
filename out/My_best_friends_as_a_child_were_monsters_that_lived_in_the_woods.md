When I was seven, I didn't have any “real” friends. I didn't need any. I was happy enough playing with the monsters who lived in the forest in our backyard.

I don't remember exactly when or how I met them. I don't remember their names either. I just remember them consisting of three big furry monsters. One of them had what appeared to be a crocodile snout with a pig nose. Another looked like a gorilla with bull horns. The third resembled a lion with gigantic fangs that extended past his chin.

I remember about the day I first met them, they insisted we play hide and seek, and that I would be “it”. We did just that, and I had a lot more fun than I expected.

Every day, I would go into the forest to play with my new friends. We never played the same game twice in a row. I remember us playing tag, I spy, and a whole bunch of others. I told my parents about my friends, and they seemed to be perfectly fine with me hanging out with them, just as long as I was back before sundown.

I remember my friends having a home in the form of a small cabin with only one room. The furniture consisted of a single table and four chairs, where we would sit and eat snacks. There were also two closets, one on each side of the room, but I never paid much attention to those.

I remember one day, my parents announced that we were moving. I told them that I didn't want to leave my forest monster friends behind, but they promised I would make more friends at our new place.

Right before moving day, I went to the forest to find my friends. As soon as I found them, I told them that I my family would be moving to a new house. They seemed to be very saddened by this, and begged me not to leave them. I told them I didn't want to leave either, but it was my parents' decision, not mine. 

After we moved, I eventually made some real friends, and forgot all about my old friends in the forest. As I got older, my parents constantly told me that I had a vivid imagination as a child, and that I had a whole bunch of imaginary friends I played with in the woods, but the details of these friends were extremely foggy.

Fifteen years later, I went to visit the neighborhood I was born in. I recognized my childhood home, which was now abandoned, and I decided to go and check it out.

I went into the backyard, and recognized the deer trail leading into the woods. I followed the path until I arrived at a very familiar-looking cabin.

I knocked on the door, and it fell off its rusty hinges. I peeked into the one room, and saw a familiar cobweb-covered table and four warped chairs.

I walked over to one of the closets and opened it. Inside, hanging on hooks, were three monster masks and three matching furry suits that looked like they hadn't been worn in years. As soon as I saw those masks, memories began flooding back, and I instantly remembered my friends from my childhood. All along, they had been people in costumes.

I then walked over to the second closet and opened that one. What I saw inside nearly made me vomit.

Laying against the closet wall were a bunch of skeletons. *Child* skeletons. Each about the same size as I would've been when I was seven.

My friends were monsters all right...just not the kind I thought they were.
