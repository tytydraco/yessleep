It’s one of those 1930’s and 40’s American lifestyle pieces. Like a Norman Rockwell or something similar. For a moment I excitedly explored the thought it might be one of his but it’s not nearly detailed enough to be a genuine Rockwell. But it does still have that iconic evocative storytelling. 



This one in particular shows a scene of a boy with his back to a tree. Not far behind the tree is the corner of a white wooden house and beside the house a long shadow peaks around the corner. 



There’s no title or author’s name visible and the people working at the antique store had no additional information to offer. But I interpreted it as the boy is hiding either because he did something wrong and is running from a parent, or maybe he’s playing hide and seek. Either way it's a fun little piece and I believe a real snapshot from the time. 



The problem is that now it’s only a painting of a tree, a house, and a long shadow coming around the corner. The boy has since disappeared. And not like he was cut out or had white-out put on him. He’s just no longer part of the scene anymore, like the artists had never painted him in the first place. Now when you look at the painting you can see the part of the tree and the grass that should have been obscured by the boy. 



This was impossible. I felt insane. I ran over the options and it seemed either someone came into my home and painted perfectly over the boy as to make him appear to have vanished. Or I was misremembering the painting I had bought. But there was just no way, for either option. 



Painting over him would be inconceivably difficult, and why would someone bother breaking into my home in order to play such a prank that would be near impossibly hard to complete on me? 



The second option seemed more possible, like some sort of one-person Mandela effect (which does sorta conflict with the meaning of the phrase all together, but you understand.) But then the painting I purchased makes no sense. There’s no story, it’s just a tree by a house and someone coming around the corner? 



While doubtful I was willing to concede to that and possibly get myself an urgent appointment with a psychologist, when I remembered I had sent a friend a picture of my thrifting haul that day, and while the painting is small in the picture you can clearly see the boy. 



I desperately wanted to know more. As it turned out, I wouldn’t have to wait long.  



That evening I was trying to go about my day as normally as I could. I decided that I would do some baking, as a favorite pastime I figured it would help me relax a bit. 



I had seen a recipe for blueberry cheesecake cookies that had been sitting in my recipe list for a while now and I decided this was a great opportunity. 



I went and got the ingredients from the supermarket and got quick to work. A thing that you should know is the house I live in is unfortunately creaky. It becomes dramatically unfortunate when you’re already on the edge. And the light wind that night was enough to make soft creaks echo and whine from down the hall. I knew it must be the wind, but even so, every time I heard that droning CREeakkk, I froze in my steps and waited until it passed.



My solution was to turn on some loud music. It was a situation where hearing and knowing more was not going to help me. After just a little longer I was able to finish up and by the time I slid the cookie sheet into the oven my thoughts were free of any 



As they baked I waited carefully nearby, (I am easily distractible and if I leave the kitchen while something is cooking it will burn), listening to music waiting for the buzzer. Strategically standing where the hallway wasn't in my peripheral vision.



\*DING\*



I set the cookies on a cooling rack then headed off to take a shower. I figured if I timed it right I could finish my shower feeling refreshed then have a sneaky cookie or two before going to bed. I was tuning the hot and cold water to be just right-



CRASHH!!



I jumped up as a cacophony of clanking metal erupted from the kitchen. My heart raced and my blood ran cold. The bathroom door was still open and if I just peaked my head out and turned I could see down the hall into the kitchen. 



It took many seconds before I could will myself to move. My ears, still ringing from the clanging metal, were focused on catching any other sounds. As if everything else was scared silent by the crash, nothing seemed to be making a noise. None of the creaking from the house, or the airconditioning, or movement of water in the pipes in the walls. 



I inched my way to the door and leaned my head out just far enough I could peer down the hall. I could only see a part of the kitchen, just enough to see a couple cookies on the floor. The portion of the kitchen I couldn’t see must be where the cookie sheet had probably landed, from whatever had made it fall. 



With careful calculated movements I stepped into the hall. Now I was being mindful of making the floor creak myself. Slowly, ever so slowly, I moved down the hall.



When I reached the doorway into the kitchen I took a moment to fortify myself before stepping in and looking around the corner. 



In the corner of the room the cookie sheet was on the ground, having landed bottom side down, some cookies had somehow managed to land back on top. Granted that was only three of the dozen I had made, but at least I’d have something to eat for all that hard work. 



I lifted the sheet back up and found somewhere more stable to set it. Inspecting where on the counter it fell from, while unlikely, I was telling myself it must have just fell on its own. I must have put it closer to the edge than I had realized or maybe I put it on something that made it uneven. Or sometimes I’ve seen how cookie sheets tend to buckle when they’re heating up or cooling down. I told myself there were many explanations why this could have happened and not just the one specific reason. 



As I was cleaning up the mess around I gathered the cookies in the crook of my arm who had unfortunately found their end on the floor. When I found them all I made my way to the trash can then stopped. I looked at my pile then looked around again, then back to my pile. There were only eight in my hands. There should have been nine, since I made a dozen and three survived. 



My head cocked up and my eyes darted around the room, down the halls as far as I could see and I still didn’t see anything. Didn’t hear anything either. 



I cautiously walked to the trashcan keeping my eyes up and alert. I stepped on the lever and the normally quiet squeak of the lid opening felt painfully loud. I tossed the eight cookies. Cautiously, I ate one of the ones that survived waiting for my heart to settle.



Once it was quiet I was ready to take my shower and go to bed. Though I thought I may lock my bedroom door for my own sense of security.



I got into the shower, turning the water to be just a little hotter than I’d usually prefer, trying to let the sting distract me. As the steam flowed up and over my body up to my mouth where it filled my lungs I began to feel calm again. 



Then a shiver started at my ankle and shot up my leg. Not a shiver of fear, but of cold. 



I turned. The cloth and plastic shower curtains obscured my view, but briefly thought I saw a short dark silhouette. 



I jumped back, moving only slightly before crashing into the tiled wall and slipping to the ground. I landed hard on my butt, splashing the plastic side of the curtain. I looked back up quickly. The water I splashed made it even more difficult to see, but as it trickled down I could no longer see the silhouette. 



I scooted over and with a shaking hand grabbed the curtain and pulled it slowly back. No one else was in the bathroom. But the door was now cracked- just slightly- enough for cold air to blow in spinning the wisps of steam into spirals. 



Grabbing the towel off the rack I stepped carefully out.  My thought in the moment was if I could close the door I could be safe to take a moment to gather myself. I gently reached forward until my hand touched the wood of the door that was cold with light condensation. Ever so slowly I leaned until the door latch pushed against the frame, then fell into place with a \*Click\* and in a flash I locked it again and let loose a breath that I hadn’t realized I’d been holding. 



Quickly, I dried myself and got dressed in my pajamas. Since it’s now fall, socks are basically required to walk on my tiled floors and the first thing you want to put on. As I was pulling up my pajama pants I noticed something on my foot. I crouched down and realized there was something on my right sock, I could see it only slightly from here as it seemed to wrap around from the sole. 



I sat down on the edge of my tub and pulled up my foot to get a better look. Orange. It was a little mark of orange, it wasn’t just orange but a swirling mix of orange and a warm beige, a touch of terracotta red. 



I didn’t understand. They had been perfectly clean white socks, I hadn’t seen that before. After a moment, a thought struck me and I went to the ground on my knees. I scanned the tile. 



There.



I leaned in closely and examined it. Exactly what I bearded it was; a droplet of water with oranges and browns swimming inside of. A little bit of *paint* suspended in water. I looked further and there they were. Just a few more, droplets of paint and water leading to the door. 



I gathered my courage. I needed to know how much farther my trail went. 



I put my hand on the doorknob and slowly applied pressure until it matched the resistance the knob gave and so incredibly slowly twisted until the latch was pulled back and I could crack the door open. 



Pressing my eye against the open slit of the door, I looked out into the hallway. I couldn’t see anything notable. I tried to search the ground for more drops but from here it was impossible to see. 



I decided on opening the door fully. I decided on a bandaid approach and with as much speed as I thought I could do without making a noise. 



I glanced down the hall to check it was clear then crouched back to the ground. With the aid of the light from the bathroom I could see much easier and found another droplet just a few inches outside the door. 



From then, following the trail of them was no difficulty. Quickly the amount of paint in each droplet seemed to diminish until there wasn’t any left at all, but the water still beaded up noticeably on the tile. 



I followed the line of droplets and saw quickly it was going to the living room. Quietly placing one step after another I made my way to the entrance of the living room. 



Standing outside the room I couldn’t see anything strange. This is the room with the painting and the thought did occur to me to check; even from here I could see that it was still missing one little boy. 



My eyes went back to the ground and with the light from the lamp hitting at the right angle, even from where I stood, I could see the water droplets leading away to the closet. The door was closed tight. 



I could move nearly silently with my socks on the tile, so carefully I stepped around the droplets and started moving toward the door. I suddenly became very aware of how heavily my heart was beating. So much so that I had the sudden fear that could be audible to others. 



I placed a hand on my heart to try to both calm myself and muffle its sound. I moved toward the door. It felt towering to me now. The droplets of water unquestionably lead inside. 



Sooner than I wished the door was within reach. The hand not on my heart was shaking. I lifted it up until it floated around the handle. My breathing had also grown harsh and quick but I sucked in a deep heavy breath and held it tightly. 



I squeezed my hand around the handle and turned. Then I pulled it open. 



Immediately all I could see were jackets hanging in front of me but I knew it went further back. I was forced to crouch again. Slowly as my head descended my view increased. I saw the dirty cement floor then I saw the two boxes piled in the back. For a moment when I saw nothing, nothing terrible or strange, I was almost ready to let out the breath, until I noticed the muddy droplets trailing behind the boxes. 



There’s no bulb in the closet and the light coming from the living room was limited so that I could just barely make out the details of the boxes. But I could tell they weren’t pushed completely to the back wall. 



I stared deep into the closet. Seconds dragging onto each other. 

Until I saw the movement.



The slightest movement. Something small and thin moving onto the box. It slid up from behind the box then settled on it. They were fingers. It was a hand. 



I felt every muscle in my body tighten, and a nearly irresistible instinct to jump back and run. But I forced myself to keep watching, I had to understand. 



I stared at the empty area beside the box and above the hand that was now clamped to it. 



Waiting, waiting. 



Then it came. The edge of a larger shape at first then a smaller shape that I recognized: an eye. It stared at me, I stared back at it. 



Then the rest came. It was a face. The face of a kid. Staring at me, studying me like I was it. But it was strange, shaped a little differently than a normal face. Then as my eyes adjusted to it I realized something. Its skin was not like mine, it was in different lines and patches, the colors varied greatly. Brushstrokes. 



They were brushstrokes. I recognized now that its face was made of brushstrokes, but in certain places they were misshaped and distorted. 



I pictured how he looked in the painting and I realized the places where the angle of his face or the way it was shaped here now in three dimensions and organically positioned instead of artfully designed, they had stretched and twisted from how they were painted. 



The final thing I saw served to settle my confusion. His other hand came into view, resting on the box, holding a cookie, with a couple bites missing. One of my blueberry cheesecake cookies. The blue marbling against the white of the cookie almost made it seem like it had been painted and something he brought with him. 



I realized, he still, in some strange incomprehensible way, was also just a little boy. 



After a minute of catching my breath and my heart beating so fast I couldn't speak, I finally was able to get a sentence out.



“Do you like the cookie?”



He stared at me for a few moments then nodded.



“Would you like another?”



He nodded again. 



Slowly, cautiously, he left the closet and followed me to the kitchen. 

I did still keep an eye trained on him. I didn’t dare let him out of my vision regardless of how I planned to handle this, but he seemed to be as afraid, if not more of me, than I of him. Though my brain did suggest this could just be a ruse. 



But ruse or not, as I held out another cookie, arm stretched fully, he fully extended his arm too and only got as close as he needed to take it. And as soon as he had it he scampered off to the corner of the room to eat it. Not unlike giving a dog a treat, I thought. 



Since then I’ve learned very little more about him. He can’t speak, he doesn’t appear to breathe, and he doesn’t even seem like he physically has to exist all the time. He disappears sometimes and reappears later on. He has a mean sweet tooth, but usually he’ll ask before taking anything. Usually. A couple missing donuts would have a formidable objection. 



Like many things that begin bizarre and strange I’ve mostly gotten used to him here. 



Today, however, I came back from having gone out for dinner. I had forgotten to turn the porch on so when I got home I fumbled with my keys until I found them and let myself in. When I got inside and turned on the living room lights I saw the closet door was open slightly. 



Cautiously, I walked over and pull my hand on the edge of the door. I slowly opened it then crouched down and looked to the back, but I couldn’t see him.



“Hey? Buddy are you okay?”



Slowly, after a couple seconds, he leaned out from the boxes and gave me one eye to meet mine. 



“What’s wrong buddy?” 



He looked at me, showing only the minimum amount of himself as he had to to see me with. Then he reached his painted hand over the boxes and pointed at me. 



My heart sank and I frowned.



“Did I scare you? I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to”



He shook his head ‘no’. Then shook his arm emphasizing where he was pointing. 



Confused, I turned behind me. 



Nothing was there. 



Just the painting - the painting with a tree, a house, no boy, and no shadow.
