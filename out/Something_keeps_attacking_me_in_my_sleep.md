The problem began when every morning when I woke up, I would feel sore patches on mostly my forearms. Or at least, that was how it started. I'm no stranger to skin conditions and rashes. When I was young, I would always have extreme reactions to mosquito bites. I remember the constant burning and itching as the inflamed skin swelled and expanded over my leg. From a single bite, these patches would grow to the size of dinner plates. It felt like tiny mites were wriggling and writhing underneath, gnawing at the membrane between the meat of my leg and that thin layer of flesh trapping them inside. Anyway, all this to say that I'm no stranger to skin conditions.

These marks were not as large or as swollen. They were sensitive to the touch, but they would quickly turn to regular bruises and fade away. Although annoying, I was not too concerned about them at first. After all, I am known to blunder around the flat I live in like Daredevil on an off day. After these patches persisted, I did eventually visit a doctor (as I'm sure some of you have run screaming to the comments to suggest). They ran some blood tests, as well as sent me to a specialist in the area, but nothing abnormal came up. They simply said, please come back if the problem persists.

Unfortunately, the problem began to escalate.

I woke up one morning to a sudden shock. A jolt ran through my arm, causing me to bolt up. In the groggy haze of my newly awakened state, I gazed around the room looking for some attacker, or maybe a cat that had slipped in through an open window. But I found myself alone. Which made the next discovery even more bizarre.

I found another red mark on my forearm. After a proper look, I quickly came to the conclusion that this was the likely cause of my rude awakening. The pain felt deeper this time. Not a soreness but an aching, throbbing feeling. It wasn't until I looked closer that I saw them: teeth marks, like something had latched onto me like a lamprey and hastily ripped itself away.

Now, I'm a bit of a paranoid person. I sleep with the windows and my room locked, even in the warmest of weather. So naturally, I thought perhaps there was a hole somewhere in my room letting some creature in, although it was almost as much of a mystery what sort of creature that could be. The bite was definitely bigger than something like a mouse or even a rat. Perhaps a cat of some sort I thought, but I'd had pet cats before. The way the markings looked, they were flatter and longer than I'd ever seen from a cat.

Still, I put these thoughts aside and ended up ransacking my own room. My housemate heard the commotion and thought I was experiencing some sort of stress-related breakdown. But after a short explanation, he helped me in my search. After a couple of hours, we quickly concluded that there was no possible way into my room. The flat was a relative new build, so less floorboards and more concrete. There were not a lot of areas where night-time critters could squeeze themselves into and out of.

Now before you ask, I did ask him (in the least awkward way I could, despite the strangeness of the question) if perhaps this was some sort of prank by my housemate. He quickly denied being the mystery midnight Dracula, as I expected to be honest, since he was a pretty self-serious person in general. He wasn't offended by the question and in fact made a useful suggestion: that I set up a camera in my room to help find the culprit. 

Not being a particularly tech-savvy person, the best way I could think to do this was to buy a cheap USB webcam, attach it to my laptop, and place it on a high enough shelf so as to get a good angle on the room.

As the issue didn't occur every night, it took a few attempts to find out what was actually going on. Three days of perusing hours of footage of me lying around was not an exciting task. Even though no new bites had appeared on these days, I still hoped that I could catch a glance at the creature causing these incidents.

Until day four.

I woke up with a wince as the same burst of pain short through my left arm this time. Despite the unpleasant feeling, I couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement knowing that my camera finally would have caught whatever this was in the act. I rushed over to my computer like a kid on Christmas morning to finally put an end to this mystery.

It was me.

I watched puzzled, as I saw clear as day how I slowly raised myself into a sitting position in the footage, raised my arm to my face, and sank my teeth into the flesh of my arm. I watched myself sitting there contently for hours, softly gumming away at my own arm, witnessing the repetitive motion of my jaw going up and down, like some sort of giant baby trying to pacify himself. It was odd to say the least. 

So I returned to the doctor, bringing the footage with me (don't worry, this isn't a story where I just so happen to visit the magnet museum with the recording in hand right after). Although I could tell from his face that he certainly found it odd, he suggested the obvious: that this was some form of somnambulism, or sleepwalking, as it's more commonly known.

After doing some research myself, I found that there have been cases of people doing all kinds of strange things while sleepwalking, even as far as someone accidentally killing their partner. That being said, the treatments were all quite vague, ranging from getting more sleep, making sure the room was as dark as possible, cutting out all noise, etc., etc. Essentially, the treatments boiled down to trying to get better sleep, which was frustrating considering my own unconscious actions were making that difficult in the first place. 

Still, I tried everything advised to me. Even old wives’ tales, just in case. I even hung up a dreamcatcher, despite having no real spiritual belief in any sort of thing. None of it helped.

The bitings continued. And not only did they continue; they worsened. The red marks had evolved to large, purple swellings. The grooves left by my teeth were engraved deeper and deeper. The skin felt like a balloon on the verge of bursting. Fluid-filled sacks of God knows what patterned my body. I wore longer sleeved clothes to cover the wounds in public, but it didn't make the discomfort any easier to deal with.

Seeing how much this was affecting me, the doctor eventually prescribed me a medication to try. And then another. And another. I won't waste time listing each one, because the long and short of it is that none of them worked. 

My sadness and pain slowly morphed into an anger. A rage. I kept recording myself, even after knowing the truth. But I stopped seeing this person in the videos as myself. No, he was the enemy now. Someone intent on destroying my life, driving me to madness. I hate him. I've taken down all the mirrors in my room, since my reflection reminds me of his disgusting face taking another contented bite into me. I want to reach through the screen and shake him. I want to scream at him to just leave me alone, just let me rest in peace for one night.

I eventually decided to take things into my own hands. The medical industry obviously wasn't helping me, so I had to come up with alternatives before the issue grew bleaker still. I purchased some large, thick belts online and using some makeshift DIY skills I attached them to my bed. It needed to be tight and heavy enough so the biter couldn't simply wriggle his way out and continue his attacks. 

To his credit, my housemate helped strap me down to make sure I could not escape without assistance (though he firmly emphasised that this was a one-off thing), and I thanked him for helping me with my strange experiment. I imagine the pitiable state I was in helped persuade him, otherwise I'm not sure he would have gone through with it. Thick, grey rings surrounded my sunken eyes, my face substantially paler than most, with my blood pooling around the thick, coarse, boil-like wounds from his… my nightly tastings. I needed this to end, no matter what.

At first, I woke up feeling different. Perhaps light-headed, but with a wave of calmness flowing over me, easing me back to reality from my gentle slumber. I did feel a bit stiff, but I assumed it was because of the unusual sleeping position and my movements being restricted by the belts.

It wasn't until my housemate entered and I saw the shocked look on his face that I knew something was wrong.

I eventually saw the footage. I saw myself writhe and struggle. I saw as I forced myself against the restraints again and again. My open mouth, chattering and gnawing at the air like a beast that hadn't eaten in years. My arms twisted and bent until they popped apart at the joints, but that wasn't enough to free them. I could hear them snap like dry branches as they lurched free out of their bondage. My limbs barely resembled arms by the time I'd managed to raise them to my face. The crunching, clicking, grinding noise that now accompanied every movement: the sound of bone rubbing against bone. Until finally I bit down hard into the gnarled mass that I called my arm. The wave of satisfaction that washed over my face as I took that first mouthful made me feel sick. And when I say mouthful, I mean it this time. The teeth pierced and tore and ripped. There was a squelching sound as my mouth filled with the meat it had longed for for so long. It savoured every second, before collapsing into a peaceful mess. 

As I write this, I'm in hospital as you may have guessed. The doctors are doing what they can and I'm grateful for their help, but I don't have much hope for a breakthrough. My arms have begun to recover, and the large plaster casts have helped keep them safe. For now. 

Something has changed, though. I can feel him now. This part of me. And he just feels so hungry. That mouthful was enough for the moment, but I know he must be satiated again soon. The red mark on my leg tells me: he is coming back.
