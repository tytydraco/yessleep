Remember how I said that things were about to get ugly around here? Ugly turned out to be an understatement. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U) 

For starters, we were forced to take more aggressive measures with the Wood Maiden. That may be shocking news for some of you, considering how much effort we put into trying to resolve things without escalating to violence if possible. However, after repeated attempts at trying to reason with her, it became abundantly clear that she had no intentions of halting her vendetta.

It was Reyna’s turn to accompany Deirdre to the Wood Maiden’s territory. The first thing they noticed was an abandoned vehicle, covered in snow as if it had been sitting overnight. Then once they ventured into the woods, they were greeted by the sight of a man’s head impaled atop a shrub. There were small birds pecking at his empty eye sockets and nostrils. His gaping mouth revealed that they’d made a nest upon his gray tongue that extended back into his throat.

This poor soul was someone from the next town over, who'd been reported missing by his daughter when he never came home from an early morning ice fishing trip. 

We’d tried to do things with compassion, knowing that the Wood Maiden was acting out of anguish, hoping that a treatment plan similar to what we use for a False Tree would suffice. Unfortunately, she was having none of it. 

Meanwhile, our county is still in a bit of a food shortage because of the Hunger Grass she’d planted. In addition, those who’d gotten sick from the Grass were experiencing complications from the extreme malnourishment they’d been subjected to, even after the curse was broken. And on top of that, she was continuing to lure unsuspecting individuals into her woods. 

It was undeniable that bodies would only continue to pile up until something drastic happened. As such, our focus has switched from simply trying to make contact with the Wood Maiden to finding her tree. If we could locate the one that she was bound to, she wouldn't be able to evade us any longer. 

I was hoping that it wouldn't come to having to kill her. Don’t get me wrong, the Wood Maiden had caused widespread suffering in her rage. She needed to be stopped by any means necessary. But after decades - possibly even centuries - of watching her forest shrink with each expansion, a part of me couldn't help but sympathize. 

To top it off, while my coworkers and I were in the middle of having this dreadful discussion about how to proceed, we got a call from another specialty pest control company located up near Lake Erie, Rodent N Roach Pest Solutions. Deirdre's eyes went wide when she answered the phone, waving Victor and I over as she put it on loudspeaker. 

The corporation’s manager sounded like she needed a nap and a strong cup of coffee. “I was approached by a client in regards to an active Wood Maiden in your operating area and was just curious about why they're asking us instead of you.”

Apparently, the developers offered this other pest control company an exorbitant amount of money to kill the Wood Maiden. We're talking four times this other company's usual rate, plus travel expenses. I was *floored*. Judging by my coworkers’ equally baffled reactions, I wasn't the only one. 

When the manager found this incredibly generous offer to be suspect, she called us to get our side of the story. Victor was more than willing to give it to her, spilling the tea about the trouble associated with the development company’s previous projects and how all of that led up to the current situation. 

At the end of it, the manager released a heavy exhale before saying, “Yeah, I'm not touching *any* of that with a fifty foot pole.”

In the end, the manager wished us luck, then hung up. For a moment, nobody spoke. Victor looked beyond exasperated. Deirdre stared at the phone as if expecting it to suddenly give her answers; if the landline had any advice, it was keeping it to itself. Reyna, eyes huge with worry, glanced between all of us. Wes simply looked dead inside, eyes half lidded,  weighed down by mental exhaustion.

Personally, I just wanted to bash my head against a wall and call it a day. Hell, call it a year. We can end 2025 early as a treat. 

Wes ended up being the one to break the silence. “So, if another company shows up, just how badly is that going to fuck things up for us?” 

“That depends,” Victor grunted, face drawn in agitation. “Not all specialty pest control is created equal. For instance, there was another company here before Orion, and then another before them.”

“Ajax Pest Control, then the Rohrs.” Deirdre provided, then when Victor gave her a curious look, she explained gravely. “I washed all of the Rohrs’ shirts. The losses were so great that the river ran red.” 

Victor had told me that other companies had failed in this area in the past, though he wasn't sure what they'd done to incur the Neighbors’ wrath. 

Reyna let out a shaky breath at this news. Specialty companies being annihilated is a tough topic. We all know inherently that it’s a possibility; each case we go on could potentially be our last. Hell, I daresay we came dangerously close to that point on Samhain, between the Dullahan and the Wild Hunt's Halloween party. Whenever the subject comes up, the atmosphere gets tense.

“So… what's the plan?” I asked eventually.

Rubbing the bridge of his nose, Victor elaborated, “Business as usual. We find the Wood Maiden's tree. That takes precedence over everything else. And if any other specialties come sniffing around, have them call me. I'll handle it.”

That specialty pest control company wasn't the only one we heard from. 

A couple others contacted us, thankfully being wise enough to scope out the situation before taking a lucrative deal. To summarize, the developers had been making the rounds all around Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. 

This put us on a deadline. We had to find the Wood Maiden before someone else took up the developers’ on their offer. We didn't want to take the chance of one coming in and mishandling the situation. Like the boss said, not all specialty companies are created equal. 

On the subject of the developers, something that I found curious was that they didn't appear to be seeking out any self-proclaimed monster hunters for this task. Only specialties. For as long as I've been here, the development company always reasoned away the locals’ and our warnings about the Neighbors as superstitions, refusing to acknowledge the existence of them until recently. 

You'd think that if they truly weren't knowledgeable about townies’ folk tales, they wouldn't be reaching out exclusively to specialists. They'd do what certain potential clients do and contract out to the lowest “capable” bidder. That makes me wonder if they'd truly been ignorant, or if they'd always known the truth and just tried to brush it under the rug. 

I don't know. I can't say for sure if anything nefarious is going on. Assume incompetence before maliciousness. But it is fishy. 

We couldn't afford to waste time, so Deirdre and I opted to venture out to the Wood Maiden’s forest after that first phone call to get a head start on things. Considering that The Girlfriend and I both have the illustrious privilege of being able to see things we shouldn't, that seemed to make the most sense. 

That, and I'd never pass up the chance on spending more time with her. Even with living and working together, we haven't seen much of each other lately thanks to how busy we've both been. Wandering around in the woods looking for a homicidal Wood Maiden isn't anyone's idea of a dream date, sure, but I'd take what I could get. 

On the subject of Deirdre, I do have an update about her condition, and it’s a big one: she was able to feel a kiss for the first time.

Once I got home from dealing with the walking rat quilt, I desperately needed something to take my mind off of that ordeal. One would think that since my life *is* a horror movie that I wouldn’t enjoy them so much. Maybe it’s because seeing other people suffer like my colleagues and I do makes me feel less alone, even if it is just all fiction. Or maybe it’s because at the end of the day, the monster or murderer takes off their mask and it’s all over. The cast all gets to wash off the cheesy, too-red gore that they’re covered in, then go home once the credits roll. 

Seeing how exhausted and disturbed I was, Deirdre had suggested watching *The Thing*, even though she said it makes her paranoid. If yinz recall, I said in my last post that I suspected that she does this as an excuse to cuddle up to me. I now have confirmation. 

She’d looked up at me with puppy-dog eyes while inching closer to me, saying, “I know it isn’t real, but… I’m so afraid!”

Anyways, I fell into her trap like the jagoff I am by holding her closer and giving her a soft peck on the lips. That was when her eyes went wide.

Again, like a dumbass, I thought that she had simply been startled by the movie. “Don’t worry, this isn’t the part where the guy’s stomach turns into a mouth.”

(On another note, I better not find any comments about me spoiling a movie from the 80’s for anyone. If you haven’t watched it by now, that’s your own damn fault.)

“I *felt* you!” She exclaimed, beaming as her hand rose to subtly touch her lips.

I blinked at her as the information sank into my exhausted, smooth brain, then I was smiling along with her. 

Playfully, I told her, “Are you sure? We should probably do it again. Y’know, for science.” 

Deirdre’s cheeks turned an adorable shade of pink as she scooted back into my arms to confirm our hypothesis. 

…Good God. Maybe Reyna has a point when she calls me a cringelord. Why do yinz read these posts, again? 

Anyways, there are hellish matters to discuss. I’ll start off by saying that Deirdre’s newfound sensory perception is the only good news I have to share. 

To my relief, there were no cadavers (or pieces of them, more accurately) waiting for us when we arrived. No other cars. No signs of life other than the birds chirping incessantly on the first tolerable day. However, I didn’t trust it. You’d be hard-pressed to find a bird that isn’t loyal to whichever Neighbor has the closest proximity to them. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Wood Maiden had enlisted their aid in plucking that poor man’s eyes out. 

Warily, I checked Deirdre’s shadow. It was intact. That rippling effect had decreased some. No shadow bird, either. 

“The Wood Maiden’s probably expecting us.” I told her, readying my supplies. 

We got something new for this case specifically: a chainsaw. 

Again, I had mixed feelings about facing the possibility of having to cut down her tree. But if it needed done, then it needed done. If it came down to it, I’d just have to stomach the guilt as best as I could.

“Even with the second sight, I don’t imagine that finding her tree will be easy.” Deirdre commented. 

Crunching over fallen twigs with the chainsaw in hand, keeping my eye out for any signs of sudden movement, I replied, “I figured as much, especially since we don’t even know what we’re looking for.”

After a moment of hesitation, Deirdre asked, “Would you be opposed if I tried one last time to draw her out peacefully?” 

I paused. “Uh, I’m holding a chainsaw and a sword made by an evil bastard, so I should probably wait outside the forest if you’re going to do that.”

She smiled sheepishly, “If you don’t mind.”

Worth a shot, right? 

I told her to yell if *anything* seemed off, even if a leaf moved the wrong way. With her having sensation again, she was more vulnerable than ever. She promised that she’d be careful, then I was on my way.

Her song followed me out:

*“Óró, sé do bheatha 'bhaile,
Óró, sé do bheatha 'bhaile,
Óró, sé do bheatha 'bhaile,
Anois ar theacht an tsamhraidh.”*

A car door slammed. What? Who was here? Keeping the chainsaw’s blade pointed downwards, I broke into a run back towards the forest’s threshold.

*“Tá Gráinne Mhaol ag teacht thar sáile,
Óglaigh armtha léi mar gharda,
Gaeil iad féin is ní Frainc ná Spáinnigh,
Is cuirfidh siad ruaig ar Ghallaibh.”*

Once I reached it, my eyes fell upon a black van. The side of it was emblazoned with the words, ELKS Pest Solutions, featuring the outline of a bugling elk bull; the antlers reminded me uncomfortably of the White Son of Mist. Their phone number was listed, as well as their address. Apparently, these guys came all the way from Clearfield County. 

Those that emerged from the van wore balaclavas. For context, some specialists feel the need to do more than use fraudulent names to conceal their identities, but in our experience, coverings only make a real difference on Samhain. Generally speaking, if something is determined enough to find you, it will. 

They all stiffened when they saw me. Can’t say I blame them, considering that I was openly staring at them with a sword on my hip and a chainsaw in my hand. I probably looked like the most normal member of Leatherface's family. 

“Hello,” I greeted them, sliding the chainsaw to the ground so that they wouldn't feel threatened. “I’m with Orion Pest Control. I come in peace. We’re in the process of dealing with an aggressive Wood Maiden.”

The driver glanced at his colleagues, then went back to me. Judging by his accent, he was from deep in the ‘hollers,’ “You on the same call as us?”

It hadn’t taken the real estate fuckers very long to hire someone, after all. Excellent. Just what we needed. 

“We have it under control. We just need some space to get the issue resolved.” I told him quickly.

He approached me, hands held out in a confused shrug, “Now, hold on a second. We drove ‘bout two hours to be here under the impression that this was a five-alarm emergency.”

“And I’m terribly sorry that your time was wasted.” I replied sincerely. “Truly, I am. I’d be irate if I were in your shoes. But with the way things have been going, I’m worried…”

I trailed off when I noticed a crow gliding down to perch on a nearby branch. Not a regular one, but a mangled mess of limbs utilized by the Hunt. Another joined it. Then another. Not good. 

It didn’t escape the ELKS employees’ notice either. The driver had noticeably tensed up, immediately averting his eyes from the accursed birds. 

The employee that had been in the passenger seat - the tallest of the three - cautiously asked, “If they've seen us already, there's nothing we can do, right?”

The driver confirmed before I could, “If we try runnin’, it'll just give them an excuse to chase us. Best to just wait and hope that they're in a listenin’ mood. And R? Mind their eyes.”

Okay. So I wasn't dealing with a bunch of amateurs or bumbling idiots, like the poor duo Iolo butchered a few months’ back. That was good, at least. 

I warned them about the mechanic’s music, Briar's thorns, and the Houndmaster’s dogs respectively. While their presence was a massive inconvenience, I couldn't blame them. They were misled and just trying to do their jobs, same as us. However, I knew that the mechanic most likely wouldn't see things that way. 

The driver had thanked me for the information, telling me that they had Hunters of their own over in Clearfield County. Although, according to him, theirs have been known to gut their victims, filling their torsos with straw and rocks, then erected into the fields like scarecrows. Sometimes the souls are left inside of their mangled bodies until the Hunters have decided that they've had enough. 

In summary, let's pray that the mechanic and the Clearfield Hunters never meet. Wouldn't want them exchanging ideas. 

The three lined the inside of the van with salt, considering that the wind made making a circle outside impossible. In the meantime, more crows had appeared. Their whispery chatters sounded like laughter. 

Wait. Deirdre had stopped singing. Why did she stop?

The third employee, who hadn't uttered a word up until this point, urged me, “What are you waiting for? Get in here!”

“I'll be fine,” I said hurriedly, starting to head back into the forest. “Just stay where you are and if you hear music, don't listen to it!”

Leaving their well-intentioned protests behind, I lugged the chainsaw along as I told myself that as long as they stayed in the van with a barrier of salt, that would offer them some semblance of safety from the mechanic. But the unease in my gut disagreed. 

However, I could only worry about one thing at a time. They were armed. They knew what was coming for them. Meanwhile, Deirdre was all alone in the woods with a hostile guardian of the forest. Her danger was not only more immediate, but more distressing. I didn't want anything to happen to her. Not again. She's just getting her humanity back. 

When I got back to the spot where we'd parted ways, I wasn't surprised to discover that she wasn't there. With the rapid snow melt thanks to the forty-degree heatwave, the forest floor was reduced to a slippy, mucky mess. Deirdre’s footprints revealed that she had lost her footing briefly, regained balance, then proceeded deeper into the forest. With how messy they were, she must've been in a hurry. 

Had she been running towards something or away? I followed in her footsteps, terrified it was the latter. 

I knew better than to call her name, as much as I needed the assurance that she was okay. Even though Deirdre wasn't her real one, it would still be unwise for various other reasons, one of those being drawing attention to myself. 

There was a scream up ahead. *Deirdre.* 

It could've just been an illusion; the Wood Maiden had used her likeness against me before. But I wasn't taking that chance. I hurried towards it, heart pounding as I dodged fallen branches and flailed to avoid falling in the mud. The chainsaw's weight made balancing more difficult than usual as the gasoline within sloshed violently with each stumble.

Something snagged the back of my coat. Too strong to be a branch. The insectoid shadow on the ground next to me revealed the mechanic, much to my chagrin. 

“It ain't her,” He informed me mildly, releasing my jacket. “Wood Maiden's fuckin’ with you.”

What was he doing here? Oh God. *The ELKS.*

Though I was afraid to hear the answer, I demanded, “What did you do to them?”

He played dumb, raising his eyebrows innocently, “Who?”

“The other pest control company that was here.”

“Ah, them.” He shrugged as if my reaction was unreasonable. “They ain't dead, don't get yourself all worked up. They're just helpin’ out with this whole construction problem.”

“What do you mean by that?” 

Iolo smiled then nodded behind me. Reluctantly, I followed his gaze, seeing a trio of small birds in a tree. One fluttered close to land on a branch right in front of my nose, putting us eye to eye. A cute, round little thing. The top of its head was black, lined by white cheeks like it was wearing a tiny hat. The rest of its body was white, accentuated with paintbrush streaks of black.  

A blackpoll warbler. 

Its shining black eyes stared into mine, as if pleading with me. My blood chilled as the dots connected in my head. 

Eyes wide, I turned back to Iolo, “You *didn't!*”

Mockingly, he replied, “Oh, *I* did.”

“How- they were in the van-” I stammered. 

“Somethin' I love ‘bout you pest control types? You're all bleedin’ hearts. They heard that scream and came right on out.” He explained while grinning like the devil. 

Being turned into a dog had been excruciating, worse than anything I'd ever felt in my entire life. I don't doubt that the ELKS' transformations were equally as torturous. And I remembered Iolo saying something about how over time, I'd become convinced I always *was* a dog. I would've lost myself, if either I or Victor hadn't cooperated. 

I turned on the mechanic, asking, “How long do they have until they forget that they're human?”

One of the birds chirped. This must've been shocking news for them. It definitely had been for me. 

Leaning against a tree, arms crossed, Iolo thoughtfully replied, “Depends. Some people lose it in less than a day. Others can hold on to their sense of self for ‘bout a week.”

Less than twenty-four hours to a week. What a window. 

The mechanic continued, “The Department of Wildlife is plannin’ on doing another inspection here at around noon. Long as these endangered sons of bitches cooperate, I'd be willin’ to *consider* changin’ ‘em back.”

The way he said ‘consider’ told me that he wasn't being entirely sincere. And even if he was, that wasn't definite. He wanted something. What else was new? Begrudgingly, I asked him what that was. 

His gaze was icy as he said, “That'll depend on how you handle what lies ahead.”

I wanted to demand what he meant by that, but with the ELKS’ humanity on the line, I didn't want to risk pissing him off. 

Quietly, I promised the transformed specialist in front of me, “I'll come back for you. Just do as he says and try to hang in there, alright? I'm *so* sorry you all got roped into this.”

The bird's small head jerked up and down in what appeared to be an attempt to nod at me. 

Redirecting my attention back to the banjo bastard, I told him, “I need to deal with the Wood Maiden first, then I'll be back.”

He shrugged, saying amicably, “That's fine. I can be patient!”

Mind racing as I tried to figure out what the hell to do, the bastard called after me, “Oh, and Fiona? You can't trust your ears. Don't let yourself get tricked again. Hell, I might not even be real for all you know! Could all just be an illusion!”

I was glad that he couldn't see me rolling my eyes, but by the way he laughed afterwards, he already knew that he'd succeeded in simultaneously frightening and irritating me. 

While I continued to follow Deirdre’s prints, I heard another scream, but it was one that came deep from the recesses of my memories. A marrow-chilling shriek that had haunted me for years after I heard it. The cry of a client who'd had his ears torn off by a transformed Housekeeper. His tongue was removed next before either Vic or I could get to him. He'd ended up having a heart attack from the shock of it all. 

That was the first bad case I'd ever had. This was also the incident that earned me the jagged scar at the corner of my mouth. That transformed Housekeeper had been a particularly vicious one. 

The Wood Maiden was making it clear that she wasn't above dealing low blows. 

My grandmother's voice told me that I was worthless as I followed Deirdre’s tail. A shape that looked to be the same height as Grandma had lingered in the corner of my vision. Her imposter's shadow was in the same direction that Deirdre had been headed. Grimly, I figured that if the Wood Maiden was digging this deep into my psyche, that meant that I was hot on her heels. 

As I pressed on, my father sneered at me that I was just like him. Unlike Grandma's imposter, he weakly crawled along the ground in front of me. Nausea rippled in my stomach even as I refused to look directly at his exposed nerve endings and raw muscle. I flinched as his stump of an arm grasped for me. 

All around me, a crowd of ghosts jeered with each step I took. Family. Friends. Clients. Soldiers. There was blood in my mouth. I'd bitten my tongue as I heard one of the kids that we lost to Auntie Rye tell me that it was my fault that he'd never grow old. 

By the time that I found the end to Deirdre’s tracks, a lot of old wounds had been ripped open. And once I saw that the Wood Maiden had Deirdre by the throat, holding her off the ground, I forgot all about compassion. 

While I yanked on the cord to start up the chainsaw, the Wood Maiden's head snapped in my direction. It revved in my hand, but didn't start. *Oh, come ON!* I pulled it again. Just like before, it *vroomed,* but didn't turn on. 

While she was distracted, Deirdre withdrew her knife and buried it into the Wood Maiden's forearm, causing the Neighbor to release her on reflex. By this time, I'd finally gotten the chainsaw to roar to life. Meanwhile, Deirdre was gagging, trying to get air back into her lungs. She was shaking, eyes wide, scrambling away from her assailant. 

All I wanted to do was go to her. Drop to my knees in the mud next to her and make sure that she was okay. It killed me that I couldn't. 

More whispers echoed through the forest as the Wood Maiden prowled towards me, her face set in a scowl. One of the voices she used against me then was Iolo's, telling me that if I killed her, that would only prove that I belonged to him. 

The Wood Maiden was fast, slinking towards me in seconds as her long claws reached for my eyes. One thing I can say for the banjo bastard is that since training with him, the Neighbors’ overwhelming quickness doesn't faze me as much as it used to. I ducked away on reflex, about to swing the chainsaw at her when I noticed a birch tree covered in the same peculiar pincushion moss that had been growing on the men that she had enslaved. 

She went for me again, extending a graceful claw out towards my chest. She was reaching for my heart. Trying to make me like the moss men. I backpedalled out of the way, almost getting nicked in the process. 

Unexpectedly, the Wood Maiden stumbled, her mouth gaping open in a mixture of shock and pain. I followed her gaze to see that Deirdre, still on the ground, had driven her knife into the tree's trunk, leaving a green gash in its wood. 

“Will you please *listen*?!” Deirdre yelled, the desperation in her voice making my heart break.

The Wood Maiden’s agonized expression slowly morphed into one of hatred as she spat, “The time for listening has long passed.”

Before either of us could respond, she lept towards Deirdre. I darted after her, intending to get between them. Deirdre curled up, her arms shielding her face as the Wood Maiden bore down on her with her claws. Panic overtook me as I heard Deirdre cry out.

Acting purely on emotion, I swiped the chainsaw across the birch's trunk. A sweet, earthy smell emanated from the gash I created. To my tearful relief, the Wood Maiden had stopped her attack as an identical injury appeared in her side, the fabric of her dress tearing as if I'd put the chainsaw through her flesh.

*I didn't want things to be like this. But you're not giving us a choice.*

The Wood Maiden advanced on me, abandoning Deirdre on the ground. As my conscience screamed at me, I deepened the cut in the birch. The sweet smell reminiscent of cut grass became even more intense as the Wood Maiden put a hand over her torn side. I'd expected her to come after me; that's why I'd done this in the first place. Wanting to draw her attention away from Deirdre. But she raised her claw towards my fallen girlfriend again, teeth showing like a feral animal.

My heart pounded as I cut more, getting halfway through the trunk. The Wood Maiden doubled over, the top half of her severed torso twisting involuntarily at an absurd angle. Deirdre crab-walked out of her reach, wincing as blood poured from the deep scrapes in her arms. The birch creaked, followed by a deafening splintering sound as gravity began to pull it apart. Likewise, the Wood Maiden's abdomen simply snapped in half, falling away from her legs at the same time as the birch hit the ground. Her entrails spilled out like wet noodles, fanning out as if trying to escape.

The Wood Maiden’s eyes and mouth gaped, a guttural grunt being the only sound she could make. She was still alive. Instantly, I discarded the chainsaw to withdraw Ratcatcher so that I could cut her head off. The sounds and movements ceased after that.

As horrible as her actions were, there was no reason to prolong her suffering.

*Deirdre.*

She was struggling to stand. I hurried over, helping her up and embracing her, kissing the top of her head. She sniffled, wrapping her arms around me.

“Stupid question, but are you okay?” I muttered into her hair.

Her voice quivering, she whispered, “It hurts.”

I released her in an attempt to check on her injuries, but she squeezed me tighter, burying her face into my chest. After that, I just kept holding her, stroking her back and telling her about how incredible she is and meaning every word of it. 

Understandably, it took some time for her to calm down. Once she came out of hiding and nodded at me, her eyes spiderwebbed red from crying, I gently inspected the gashes that the Wood Maiden’s claws had left in her forearms. They were deep enough that small yellow globules of fat were visible.

While I fussed with a roll of gauze that I kept in my toolbelt for emergencies, wrapping it around the slashes, I told her, “We need to get you out of here.”

It didn't take long for the gauze to darken as the cuts struggled to clot. Deirdre looked even more pale than normal, gray eyes dazed and unfocused. Worried about her fainting, I kept an arm around her waist to support her on our trek back out of the forest.

I had to get her to a hospital. That was certain. The Wood Maiden had messed her up pretty good. God, I wish we hadn't parted ways. We should've stuck together. I know Deirdre had wanted to try to help the Wood Maiden one last time, and for the record, I had, too. However, in hindsight, we should've known better. Known better than to separate and to think that it would work.

And now Deirdre was hurt over it. 

Afterwards, once she got patched up, she actually *scolded* me from her hospital bed while her arms were covered in enough wrappings to qualify her as a living mummy.

“Don’t you *dare* blame yourself for this, Nessa.” She’d told me sternly, knowing me well enough to read my mind. “*I* was the fool that chose to pursue her on my own. *I* was the one that got *myself* hurt. If I catch you beating yourself up over it, so *help* me, woman, I'll give you a clatter!”

Yup. She actually called me ‘woman.’ The painkillers made her go full Irish on me. 

Eventually, the adorable spitfire I call a girlfriend fell into what I hoped was a peaceful sleep, facilitated by the medications she'd been given. The doctor had said she wanted to keep Deirdre overnight to make sure that her injuries didn't develop any unexpected complications. For context, we'd told them it was an animal attack.

A part of me was terrified that pincushion moss would begin to grow out of the slices in Deirdre’s arms. Her shadow looked the same as it had before we went into the woods, but that didn't satisfy my unease.

Once Deirdre was out, I took a second to gently brush away a stray lock of hair that had fallen across her face, noting how she looked and having to fight off guilt again. Meanwhile, I hadn't forgotten about the ELKS and in the back of my mind, I'd been working over how to get them out of this. 

I could always challenge him. If I won, he'd have to let them go. However, if I lost, that meant that they'd be blackpoll warblers forever.

Still, Iolo had heard me promise the transformed specialists that I'd return, and he would hold me to it. No matter what, I had to go back out into the woods that night, lest I face the consequences of breaking a promise made in the presence of a Neighbor. 

Before doing so, I wanted to get a hold of Reyna first, see if she'd be willing to sit with Deirdre in my stead. I didn't want her to be alone. Not just because I was concerned for her, but also because this was her first time ever experiencing modern medical care. It had been a huge shock for her, especially when they gave her an injection prior to suturing her injuries closed. They'd also felt inside the wound for any debris before closing it up. During the procedure, she'd squeezed my hand so hard that I'd thought my fingers would break. 

Reyna had been sympathetic, opting to come by once she was done disposing of some mice she removed from our local high school. Before leaving, I checked on Deirdre again, seeing that she was still slumbering soundly. I located a dry-erase marker and a napkin so that I could write down where I was going and why, then assured her that Reyna was on the way. I also drew a couple of stick figures kissing surrounded by a heart.

Try as I might, I don't think I'm very good at being romantic. Feel free to drop some advice in the comments: I need a non-smoothbrained opinion. (As long as it's not from the horny jail. I love yinz dearly, but *no.*)

With great hesitation, I dropped a light kiss on her forehead before slipping away. She let out a soft, precious hum as she stirred slightly, then went still once again. 

Darkness was falling by the time I got back to where the ELKS Pest Solutions van sat abandoned. It looked so forlorn sitting there, like a massive metal tombstone. Nearby, I saw piles of clothes, left on the ground as their owners were contorted into much smaller bodies.

Using my flashlight, I tried to find my way back to where I'd last seen the mechanic and the ELKS. Everything looked different in the dark. It was disorienting. 

I heard a series of high-pitched, squeaking chirps, then a flutter of wings nearby. A warbler flew into the beam of my flashlight. The fact that the transformed ELKS employee had come near me was a good sign, indicating that at least that one of them hadn't devolved into primal instinct yet.

“Do yinz still remember who you are?” I asked uneasily. “One chirp for yes, two for no.”

One chirp. That lessened some of the tension in my chest.

Next, I questioned, “Can you lead me to the one that did this to you?” 
 
The specialist flitted awkwardly from tree to tree, always staying within the range of my flashlight. I didn't know how much longer we had, so I did my best to hurry while navigating through puddles and detrius with the help of my cursed guide. 

That was when I began to hear a scraping sound. Digging? It got louder as I drew nearer. 

My light illuminated the mechanic, using a shovel to carve a deep hole into the earth right next to where the three sections of the Wood Maiden’s body lay. His banjo was propped up against a tree, close enough that he could reach it in seconds if someone made a move on it.

“You left quite a mess,” He commented as he stabbed the ground with the shovel. “Were you intendin’ on cleanin’ it up, or were you just waitin' on the buzzards to do it for ya?”

“My beloved needed help.” I replied bluntly. “That took precedence.”

He ignored me, “You know, buryin’ a Wood Maiden will give ‘em a second life. It takes some time, seein’ as they're trees and all. It's how they make more of ‘em. One life goes, another begins.”

Why was he telling me this? He never expressed any concern about her at any point prior to this. If anything, he'd seemed apathetic. Not to mention that Hunters are famously known to prey on Wood Maidens.

I dared to ask him, “Why do you care?”

He paused in his digging to give me a scathing look, made even more threatening by the low light. 

“I recall you sayin’ one time that you hate the way our kind was treated. You still stand by that?” His voice was low, challenging. 

Honestly, I replied, “I do.”

“Now's your chance to prove it.” 

“I want to, but-” At that he let out an aggravated sigh and shook his head. Keeping my voice gentle, I urged him, “Will you please listen?”

Iolo still looked strange. A cold mix of anger and something else, though I couldn't put my finger on what that was. But he didn't argue further, silently staring holes through me. 

“I'll do it,” I told him. “If you agree to turn the ELKS pest control specialists back into who they really are. Tonight.”

For a moment, I didn't think he would go for it. Why would he?

I continued, hearing my voice break a little bit as the guilt crept back in, “I meant what I said about wanting things to get better. This is *not* how I wanted any of this to go. I really do want to help her. Not just so that you'll release them, but to give her a chance at *something* after all of this.”

The mechanic’s glower didn't lighten any as he thrusted the shovel into the ground, saying, “Fine. Best get into it.”

He then turned to grab his banjo by the neck. While I continued what he'd started, widening the grave enough that the Wood Maiden's remains would fit, he played in the background. After a while, I heard the sickening crackle of bones, the meaty sound of flesh tearing, and squeaks that slowly morphed into agonized shouts. With a gasp, I dropped the shovel, turning on Iolo.

“I held up my end,” He informed me coldly. “Time for you to hold up yours.”

“Are they-”

He cut me off impatiently, “They're fine. You know the change ain't no fuckin’ picnic, Fiona. They came here meddlin’ in shit they had no business involvin' themselves in. I'm lettin’ ‘em off easy by givin’ the chance to run on back to where they came from. I could always change my mind.”

Without uttering another syllable, I returned to my task.

In death, the Wood Maiden's eyes were dim. Empty. Her face was frozen in an open-mouthed expression of terror. With a swallow, I aligned the sections of her body where they belonged in her makeshift resting place, then began covering her with a blanket of dirt. Worms welcomed her into their domain, inching across her skin.

By the time I was done, my shoulders and arms were sore. Iolo hadn't moved from where he oversaw my progress. 

Even though I should know better than to let my curiosity get the better of me, I tried questioning him again, simply because this request had been entirely out of left field for him, “I thought you didn't care about the Wood Maidens.”

“I don't.” He answered, confusing me further. 

“Then why…?”

Eyes hard, he shut me down. “You don't need to know everything. We both got what we wanted, now let's leave it at that.”

*Okay.* 

Without bothering to say anything else, I departed to leave him to his moodswing. Finding the way out was easier said than done. Yinz ever walk in unfamiliar woods at night? Dangerous business. It all begins to look the same after a while. Coyotes yipped in the darkness, but thankfully, they sounded far off. A good rule of thumb in situations like that is to walk in a straight line so that you don't find yourself going in circles. Presumably, you'll get somewhere eventually. 

The rumble of an idle engine told me I was getting close. Headlights flickered on. The ELKS had made it back to their van as unscathed as they could be after what the mechanic put them through, though all of them looked sickly and haunted. 

The driver, the same guy with the Mountains accent, simply told me, “Thank you.”

Not knowing what else to day, but, being all too familiar with what they'd experienced, I admitted, “I still have nightmares about the time that Huntsman turned me into a dog.”

After a pause, the guy offered a wry smile, “Were you at least a cool dog?”

“Yeah. A pitbull.” I said with a small laugh. “Yinz were some snazzy looking little birds.”

After some more back and forth between all of them, I wished the ELKS safe travels. In turn, they bade Orion good luck on whatever shitshow awaits us [next.](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/SO6b77lmMD)
