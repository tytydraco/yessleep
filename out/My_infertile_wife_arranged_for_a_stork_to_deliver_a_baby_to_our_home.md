I wish that were the punchline to some terrible joke, but if you’d lived in our house for the past eighteen months, you’d know better than to question Ella’s sincerity.

Nothing is funny to her anymore.

My wife *used* to be a joker. That was before we spent a year and a half unsuccessfully trying to conceive a child. Back then, she wore irony like a jumpsuit; a defensive article so well-fastened to her body, she would have been unable to remove it in a hurry.

But Ella lost that side of herself after months upon months of failed attempts at conception. I wanted the two of us to take fertility tests earlier this year, but it wasn’t until two weeks ago that she agreed. The results were bad on both fronts: my swimmers were few in number, and Ella’s estrogen levels were rather low. Treatment was mentioned, but my wife was too distraught to discuss that, so the doctor simply suggested we keep trying.

Ella had already been far from her chirpy self for months, but she became twice as reserved over the following fortnight. Her spell was only broken on Saturday morning, around three o’clock, when the two of us were stirred from our sleep by a rapping on the bedroom window. Or maybe I was stirred by the ecstatic gasp Ella let out.

“What’s that noise?” I asked as the knocking persisted.

I rubbed my eyes as my wife eagerly bounded out of bed and rushed towards the window. She tore open the drapes and invited streetlight into the room.

“It’s here,” she whispered.

Half-awake, with my eyesight and brain both woolly, I saw something absurd perching on that wooden ledge; two things, I should say.

A baby swaddled in pristine white fabric.

And whiter still: a *stork*.

The bird sat with its blood-red legs tucked under its large white feathers, watching with black eyes of unnerving intellect as Ella opened the window and scooped the sleeping baby from its resting position on the ledge.

“Thank you,” my wife said to the animal.

Meanwhile, I hadn’t managed to say a thing. I was dumbfounded into silence, I suppose, because *there was a fucking stork on our windowsill*; a fucking stork that had, more nonsensically still, brought us a newborn babe in a cotton burrito wrap to our suburban home at 3:17am. And as the bird brandished its impressive wingspan, elongating its slender legs as it did, my jaw dropped; perhaps in preparation for me to finally utter something to my wife.

Ella shut the window and cradled the mystery child as its mystery delivery bird took flight, slipping into the dark.

“What the hell is happening, Ella?” seemed as appropriate a starting question as any.

She replied without taking her eyes off the child in her arms. “I did something, Philip.”

I didn’t like that response. “What did you do? Whose child is that?”

“Ours.”

Then my wife, who had been despondent for eighteen months, giggled contentedly. Teardrops ran the length of her face, wrapping around her chin and meeting her neck. I hadn’t seen her joyful in a long while, and I’d *never* seen her that tearful. As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, I didn’t question the legitimacy of the scenario for even a second. My wife wasn’t pranking me. She wasn’t joking around. She wasn’t capable of that, after having been so broken for so long.

Given it was all real, then, I was more terrified than I had ever been.

“Ella, I don’t understand. Where did that child…” I began, not knowing what word to choose, “… originate?” A silly word, perhaps, but I knew the newborn hadn’t originated from us.

*Obviously*, you might say, but nothing seems “obvious” to me anymore.

Not after what Ella and I experienced this weekend.

“Originate?” she said. “Well, from the stork, of course.”

I sighed. “Ella…”

“The stork brought us a child. You saw it with your own eyes.”

“I don’t know what I saw.”

“Okay,” she said absently, still not looking away from that thing in her arms.

I hated thinking of the child that way. As a “thing”. But this whole ordeal felt unnatural. Supernatural. Why? Call it a gut instinct, even if that makes your eyes roll, but I’m not some fruit loop; until that day, I’d never leant one way or the other when it came to superstitions or paranormal phenomena. That morning, however, I felt the tingle of some sense I hadn’t previously known I even possessed.

This was very bad, and not the my-wife-has-bought-a-child-from-the-black-market bad.

I got out from under the duvet and trotted delicately over to my wife, opting to take the gentler approach. I placed my hands over hers and rocked the baby with her. She looked up at me, finally, and smiled. I’d earnt her attention.

“Ella, I need you to tell me exactly what you meant when you said you ‘did’ something.”

She leant forwards and planted a kiss on my cheek. “Isn’t it obvious? I found a way for us to have a child, Philip. The stork brought us a gift from the heavens.”

Ridiculous. Sure, I’d heard the myths of storks carrying bundled babies in their beaks. *Myths*. But now I wonder whether myths have some root in truth. Maybe those old stories about the storks and the babies came from something real.

“Sweetheart,” I said, “that stork, and this baby, did not come from ‘the heavens’. Please just be straight with me. Why and how are they really here? What did you do?”

Ella’s smile dropped a little, and she looked hurt.

“Screw you, Philip.”

“Screw me?” I scoffed. “I wake up at three in the morning to find a *baby* on our windowsill, and I’m the arsehole in this situation? For crying out loud, Ella, just tell me what—”

“*THE RECEPTIONIST!”* Ella screamed in my face, before taking a breath and continuing quietly. “When we were leaving the clinic last week, and you were still talking to Dr Harper, the receptionist… consoled me. She told me a number to call.”

“What do you mean?” I asked. “What number?”

Ella ignored me. “I called it, then I waited eleven days, like the man said. Waited for our *ripe* child.”

*Ripe*. I didn’t like the way that clunky and oddly chosen word had been wedged into her last sentence.

“The man?” I asked. “Ella, you’re being so cryptic. Please… Help me out here.”

“I waited eleven days, and that brings us to this morning. A white-winged angel delivered this *gorgeous* boy to us. A boy of our own. Just what we’ve been killing ourselves to create for nearly two years. We… We’ve earnt this, Philip. We’ve worked hard enough for it, haven’t we? *Haven’t we?*”

I don’t know why I gave up at that moment. I think my brain broke completely.

“I think we need to sleep now,” I whispered, walking over to the window.

Ella nodded and smiled again. “Yeah, I suppose I should put Little Adam down into the cot.”

When I really think about it, I’m quite sure I believed sleep would fix everything; that I’d wake up to find this had all been a dream, because how could it possibly be real? I would wake up to find nothing in the guest room’s cot; that pre-emptive and rather distasteful, as far as I was concerned, hand-me-down from Ella’s mother.

I closed the drapes in one swift motion, but my heart shrivelled and tightened in fear. Greater fear than had been induced by even the revelation of the stork or the baby on the windowsill. I processed what I had seen for that split second.

A man standing on the other side of the street.

He had been looking up at our window.

When I opened the curtains again to get a second look, he was gone. Of course he was gone. But that was a blessing from my perspective, as it only helped me to dismiss the whole thing as sleep-deprived madness.

*Just a bizarre dream born of your heartbreak in this complicated time. You’re grieving the child you and Ella are unable to conceive. That’s all. You’ll see when you wake up. And then you’ll book a therapist because, let’s be honest, this is the most lucid nightmare of your life.*

But that inner pep-talk didn’t change the truth. I woke to find Ella scurrying about the house with Adam nestling in the nook of her arm. And I followed her about like a ghost, blinking repeatedly; trying to blink the baby out of existence, perhaps.

Everything I experienced that day went in one ear and out the other; baby monitors, and baby-proofing, and baby this, and baby that. But I’m not some shithead of a husband. I was just reeling from the horror of it all.

A baby had materialised out of thin air in the middle of the night.

Oh, no, I’m sorry. A stork brought it.

*Which means the man was real too,* was the next frightening thought\*.\*

My gut lurched, and I spent most of Saturday staring out of windows at our empty street. And the daylight vanished quickly on that short winter day, so I was left staring out into the black. Fighting to discern shapes moving between the glow of the streetlamps. My heart didn’t loosen. I don’t think it had loosened since Adam arrived.

“Philip,” said Ella at the end of the day. “I’m going to need you to help me out more tomorrow.”

I frowned at my wife, who was once so sharp-minded. *What the hell is wrong with you? I know you’ve not been yourself for a long time, but this isn’t that. Now you’re barely acting human, never mind acting like Ella. A stork delivered a baby to our window. We know nothing about this child. We know nothing about that man in the street. And I know you feel that tightness in your chest, just like I do. The warning that something unearthly is afoot. That we need to get out of here right now*.

That was the speech I should have given Ella.

“Sorry,” I replied instead.

I know my behaviour seems strange, but I was in shock. Have you ever experienced an existential horror that forced you to question your very understanding of reality? It does something to you. Your brain. Your entire sense of being. In my case, I was left a husk.

I went to bed that night hoping, once again, I would wake up to find none of it had been real. And when I woke at 2:03am in a sweat, I did—for perhaps as many as three or four seconds—believe just that: *oh, it was a terrible dream after all, and I’m awake now*.

But the crackle from the baby monitor grounded me. Adam was crying. And I felt like crying with him as I headed down the corridor. I entered the guest room to find the baby wriggling about in his cot; bawling, and slobbering, and snotting all over himself.

“Hush, baby…” I cooed, picking up ‘our’ child for the first time.

He settled immediately.

I had hoped that holding him might change things. Might warm my heart. Might make me decide it didn’t matter where the baby had originated. It didn’t matter how he had come into our possession. It didn’t matter whether the stork had been responsible, or had simply been a decorative part of an elaborate delivery orchestrated by that mysterious figure in the street.

But holding the baby made everything worse.

My fingers had never felt so frozen. Not figuratively, but quite literally frozen, for the baby was ice-cold to the touch. Worse yet, Adam looked at me with a face like no other. Again, I’m not being a shithead. I have nephews and nieces in abundance. I’ve seen and held newborns before. I know they all look different, but this just wasn’t right. I’ve never seen a baby’s face quite like his.

Never seen a *human’s* face quite like his.

Adam wasn’t safe. That was all I thought as he smiled up at me, in a manner too knowing. In a manner unthinkably sinister. His little fingers curled around one of mine, striking me with terror so pointed and piercing that I thought my heart might give out there and then. I’d been right all along; this baby was a *thing*.

Just as I was about to put Adam back into the cot and flee the house, grabbing Ella in the process, I was glued to the spot by a sound.

A creak from the wardrobe at the other side of the room.

My hands at long last warmed up, becoming clammy as I faced the now-ajar door of the closet to find—

Darkness.

My imagination had conjured up all sorts of horrors staring back at me through the crack, so I let out a sigh of relief and lay Adam back down. I even tried to settle my gut by telling myself the baby was perfectly ordinary. That it was only the situation which was unordinary. Of course, no matter what my wife had agreed with the stranger on the phone, I imagined there could be no legal or ethical explanation for how she acquired Adam.

Still, he was just a baby, I told myself. He had to be.

It happened as I was distracted by his cherub face.

The door to the wardrobe swung open.

And by the time I had clocked the shape moving towards me, it was already upon me. He was upon me. That man, face masked by the shade of that unlit room with drapes drawn closed. I screamed as he pinned me to the ground, elbow flattening my windpipe. And the world faded as he spoke to me in a tone full of grit.

“You’re not the father he needs… You see too much of him, don’t you? You shouldn’t. He isn’t *ripe* yet.”

The black outline of my vision pushed inwards, stealing away the world. I thought of Ella and even Baby Adam. My greatest fright was that, once my life had been extinguished, they would be next.

At the edge of blackness, there came tremendous noise: a screech, footsteps against the floor, a scuffle, then an agitated voice.

I felt the force lift from my windpipe, and I could breathe properly again.

“*PHILIP?”* Ella cried as she turned on the light.

My eyesight readjusted as Ella reached over the cot to scoop out Adam, and I sat upright to get a look at the body of my attacker. He lay unmoving in a pool of blood, knife handle jutting from one temple.

I don’t know how my wife overpowered him.

I don’t know anything after this weekend.

Ella and I spent most of Sunday talking to police investigators. Explaining that my wife had killed the intruder in self-defence. What I found strangest was that the detectives had no questions about the baby at the heart of this break-in and murder attempt. The baby who, I was sure, would not show up on any official records. I was doubly sure Ella and I wouldn’t be listed as his parents.

They *should* have had questions. That’s what I keep thinking. That and something one of the officers said, with a wry smile, before leaving our home.

“Goodbye, Adam. You ripe little [thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).”
