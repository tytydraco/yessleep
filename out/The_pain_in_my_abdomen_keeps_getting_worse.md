I awoke with a start to a gnawing sensation below my diaphragm. I checked my phone. 3:42AM. I had to be up for class around 7AM, so I was irritated that my sleep had been broken so suddenly. That irritation was swiftly washed over by dread as the gnawing sensation gradually intensified.

I groaned and rolled onto my side. My roommate, who likes to stay up late, threw me a worried glance from her side of the dorm.

“Are you good? I thought you were asleep.” She inquired, looking back at me from her computer. I curled into a ball, but that only seemed to worsen the sensation.

“Uh, I don’t know,” I said after a moment of hesitation as I mentally tracked the pain through my body. Appendicitis? Food poisoning? Cramps? Kidney stone? Intestinal issues? All the possibilities raced through my hypochondriatic mind. I tugged my phone from its charging cable and tried googling symptoms, but instead got lost in a rabbit hole of possibilities.

“Well, I’ll be here if you need anything. Hope you feel better.” My roommate offered me one more sympathetic gaze before turning back to her computer.

I returned to laying on my back, something that usually helps to subside the pain of a period cramp. How long would this have to go on before I was justified in calling for help? I couldn’t afford to miss class in the morning. I had a chem exam. Lowering my phone, I let my mind be engulfed by the pain as I again attempted to locate its source. 
I decided I would wait it out, a decision I would soon regret.

The next half hour was comprised of me stifling sobs as the pain traversed my abdomen. The sensation mimicked that of a bad period cramp, only it was a tad higher than a period cramp should be. It was hot and burning, like fingernails dragging on skin. Pushing and prodding. A sudden sharp jab in my lower left abdomen sent my mind into a panic. 

I snatched my water bottle from next to my bed and began to chug, hoping to flush out whatever was going on inside me. That’s when, thinking back, I heard what I can only presume was a voice. Soft and nearly unintelligible, but nonetheless a voice.

“More…”

I choked on my water at the sound. Looking over at my roommate, she was still hunched over her computer, headphones in. My blood  ran a cold blue that only for a moment distracted me from the searing red I still felt in my abdomen. After hearing nothing more, I took another swig and dismissed the sound as a manifestation of my dreary, pain-infested 4AM mind.
An hour later, it the pain became too much to bare and I had my roommate drive me to the hospital.

I am a bit embarrassed to write this here, but the doctors decided to perform an endoscopy to see what was wrong. The process was difficult and uncomfortable. I almost regretted not trying to tough out the pain a little longer. Afterwards, I could hear murmuring from the other side of the door as the doctors paced between rooms, distress evident in their voices. When they finally entered to show me the pictures, I nearly fell to the ground.

Amidst the flesh and tissue there were human-like bite marks.
