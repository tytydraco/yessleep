My dad has always been a hunter. Even now, at his ripe old age of fifty-six, he still tries to get out, lay traps, hunt squirrels, and even takes in other hunter’s kills and butchers them (most of the time for a payment of only meat). He doesn’t do much deer or bear hunting anymore, but on a good day, you’ll catch him in the woods on his side-by-side, looking up in the trees for a squirrel, or chasing a raccoon out of its hole. Selling the meat or hide hardly grants any money for the time it takes to hunt, kill, prepare, and ultimately cure the hide, but my dad still does it. I think it’s because he’s done it all his life, and it has slowly become a routine, a ritual, a need. If he’s not occupying his time, then his doing nothing, and in his mind, doing nothing is how you die. These days, my dad isn’t very fit. He’s older, he’s weaker, and he damn-near can’t walk anymore. But you will still catch him out in the woods, rifle in his hand, knife on his belt, and a fresh kill or two in the back of his side-by-side. Although, I think that is subject to change now. Everything is going to change now. 

A few days after Christmas and into the new year, we received a package from UPS. I was surprised it was even delivered, because there was over eight-inches of snow on the ground. The snow wouldn’t stop for another two days after this, either. I checked my Amazon account and found that yes, it indeed was meant to be delivered that day, I just didn’t receive the notification. It was good news anyway, the Christmas present I ordered for my dad had finally arrived, a week and some change after Christmas. I was excited to present it to him, as he had never owned one in his life: an infrared scope. Night vision. I opened it, made sure it worked really quick in my room, put it back in its packaging, and presented it to my dad. 

“Shit, son, this is amazing. You wanna go outside and test it?” He was beaming, my gift was definitely better than the two-dollar watch my brother had gotten my dad. 

“Yessir, I’ll slip my boots on real quick. Frankie, you come too.” My brother, Frankie, began pulling on his full snow gear. I, who run hot as a furnace most of the time, just slipped on a jacket and my boots, my dad did the same. 

We opened the main door then the screen door leading to our back porch, which bordered the woods almost directly. The screen door creaked, then slammed shut as the springs kicked it into overdrive. In single file, we marched down the steps, my dad holding onto the infrared scope with the delicacy of holding a chicken egg. He put it up to his eyeball, lifting his glasses up as he did so, and toggled the infrared function on them. He bellowed out in laughter. 

“I’ll be a sonofabitch, this is incredible, son!” He scanned the tree line over and over. He noted a squirrel in one of the trees closest to him. A bird, finch of some kind he said, in a bush a little further away. And then he stopped dead. Frozen momentarily. “What the fuck is that?” 

“What is it, dad?” Frankie spoke up, nearly shouting. 

“Quiet! Quiet!” Dad had started speaking in a whisper, and hunkered down. We both did the same.  

“Dad,” I whispered back at him nearly a minute later, he was still staring off into the edge of the forest, “let me see.” Reluctant to take his eye off whatever had caught his attention, but knowing I had the second most experience in the woods among us, and knowing that if anyone were to identify an unknown animal, it would probably be me, he handed me the infrared scope. Looking through it was awesome, everything was immediately bright, and I could make out probably 100, maybe even 200 or more feet into the woods. It wasn’t exactly in true focus, as focused as I could get was probably, to put it in a term most of you can understand, 480p quality. Like a video shot on an older camera. I scanned the tree line, looking for whatever my dad saw, but seeing nothing. Then, movement. Something shaking in the woods, at the very edge of focus on the infrared scope.  

“It’s eating.” I found myself whispering this to my dad. 

“A deer, I know. But what is it?” 

“Frankie, go get dad’s rifle. Now.” 

“Let me s-” I cut him off with a wave of my hand. He’s only 11, and has never been good at whispering. 

“Now, Frankie. The 45-70, not the 30-30. Load it, cock it, and bring it. Quietly.” Frankie got up and moved into the house without another word, he was smart enough to not let the door creak and slam like we so carelessly did coming out there. "I have no idea what the hell that is, Dad."

The thing in the woods was covered in blood. The thick fur on its neck and shoulders were clearly matted, wet with the blood of the deer. I dared to move closer. Five feet, ten, then fifteen. The image getting clearer and clearer as I went. Thirty feet closer and I could the unnatural bend in the thing’s knees. I could see the three long claws digging into the flesh of the deer. I could see its snout, which I didn’t notice before, ripping apart the flesh in its hands. Its ears were pointy and long, its body wide and muscular. Almost like a werewolf, but not like in the movies. There was nothing human about this beast. It was more like a mutant wolf. Something born from a wolf, of which my state has none, and turned into a creature that stood, as far as I could tell, eight feet off the ground. And that was on all fours. Its spine was curved, like a scared cat, hunched over eating its food. Yet, much like a raccoon, it used its hands to eat. Fur did not cover its legs, or head, just the neck and torso. As it moved to reposition itself on the other side of the deer, I heard the screen door close softly behind me. I didn’t dare look away from the beast. Its eyes were mere slits in its face, the sockets themselves looked completely empty, and what little hair it did have on its head was long, thin, stringy, and waving back and forth as it shook the blood from its matted neck fur. It licked and cleaned itself slowly. Then went back to the deer, continuing its feast.  

Frankie reached dad, and dad passed the rifle to me in the dark. My dad’s lever action 45-70 had a scope attached to it, but this infrared scope could also be mounted in front of the normal scope already on the gun. I shoved it on, took the Allen wrench that was stuck directly on the scope itself, and tightened it down. I knew the scope was sighted in just last week, so I hoped it would be accurate. I trusted that Frankie had cocked the gun inside like I told him. I aimed at the beast, held my breath, and fired. The trigger clicked in my hand. It was loud. My idiot brother cocked the fucking gun before loading it. There wasn’t a round in the chamber. I had dry-fired, and it was loud. The wolf-thing in the woods’ ears pointed straight up, flicked around, and then it looked right at me, baring its crooked, sharp teeth. I held a scream and cocked the rifle, successfully putting a round in the chamber. The thing was barreling toward me, running at speeds I have never seen anything that big move. It leaped and bound its way effortlessly through the woods, directly at me. It, too, had infrared. There was and still is no doubt in my mind. It could see me, and I could see it. The wolf-thing's eyes opened wide, and so did its mouth. They were in fact empty, completely. I suppose you don’t need pupils when you see in infrared. Sensors or something, I guess, inside those black, lifeless, sockets. 

It sprang from the ground, a great leap from nearly twenty feet away, heading right toward me. I pulled the trigger and a deafening boom rang my ears. If any of you have fired such a weapon, you know how loud they are. Deafening is an understatement, as I could hear a very high-pitched ringing, and nothing else. The thud from the gun on my shoulder knocked my face, more importantly my eye, away from the infrared scope. I quickly cocked the gun, placed my face against the scope, and looked through the infrared again. It was gone. I hit it, maybe only nicked it, but it was gone. In the snow, I could see tracks leading away, and a few drops of blood following them. God, I hope I killed it, and I hope it was the only one.

My dad has been up every night since, in his rocking chair, 45-70 in his lap, infrared scope in hand, looking out the back window, and eyeing the tree line. I don’t think he or I will be going into the woods ever again.
