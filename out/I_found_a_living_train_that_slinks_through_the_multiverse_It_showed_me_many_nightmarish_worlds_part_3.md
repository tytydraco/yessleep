&#x200B;

The Necromancer loomed in the background as his undead puppets rushed us by the dozens. His dark abyss of a face revealed nothing, but his diseased, gurgling laughter did.  
  
Just as all hope seemed lost, orange light like a supernova exploded from the hallway. Far off down the corridor, I saw the creatures Brother had called the Maia floating toward us, their translucent, glowing bodies shimmering and spiraling in an eerie synchronization. The Necromancer’s laughter continued. In the heat of the battle, he didn’t immediately notice the new threat approaching silently from behind him. The three of us continued fighting for our lives.   
  
As the Maia got within a few dozen feet of the Necromancer, they raised their hands as one. A smell like ozone filled the air, and all the hair on my body stood up. The Necromancer turned, sensing something off. When he saw the three Maia floating there, he gave a deep roar of fury.  
  
Golden electricity exploded from the Maia’s fingertips, sizzling the undead with their intense current. The walking corpses seized and kicked as current sizzled through their bodies. They fell to the floor like ragdolls, their bodies limp and motionless. A smell like searing steak filled the room. With a single backwards glance at his fallen army, the Necromancer fled, roaring in anger. Two of the Maia followed after him in a blur, raising their hands. An arcing current hummed between their many translucent fingers, filling the air with a smell like ozone and lightning.  
  
“The Necromancer has kidnapped our brethren,” the remaining Maia whispered in a thin, hissing voice. “You may go.” And, without looking back, the four of us jumped over the bodies of the corpses and headed out of that hellish place. As a group, we ran back to the train. Cook and I took turns helping Jeremiah. He looked like he might collapse at any moment.  
  
The train sat, motionless and still. Its feeding frenzy had finished, and the doors stood open, welcoming travelers in. All around it, I saw drag marks and craters where the limbs of the train had ripped organic matter or animal life from the alien planet’s surface.  
  
After a few minutes of waiting, the doors slid closed behind us with a squishy thud as the demonic voice came over the speakers, spitting and gurgling, saying:  
  
“Next stop: The Shadow Plains of the Collective Mind. We will reach our destination in four hours.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
“We don’t have to get out again, do we?” Jeremiah asked. Rivers of sweat dripped their way down his dirty face, leaving clean paths through the filth coating his skin. He shook, and his tanned complexion looked muddy and pale now. “I don’t feel too good…”  
  
“No, hopefully not,” Brother said, “the train only feeds once every few days. We will not need to get out on the Shadow Plains unless we are forced to by something else.”  
  
“Aren’t they going to see you?” I asked Brother. “If they’re hunting you and we’re stopping on their planet…”  
  
“They might,” Brother said unworriedly. “It wouldn’t be the first time. If they do, we’ll stand and fight. They’re not immortal, after all. I’ve killed dozens of those wretched, worm-like things.”  
  
The train had rapidly accelerated until the Boglands became simply a dark blur of fungi and empty sky. After a few minutes, when I looked out, I realized we had already left that world behind. Now it looked like an empty abyss outside the train.  
  
I didn’t know when we had transitioned to this interim place, but I quickly realized it wasn’t as empty as it appeared. There were waves in the shadows, as if an inky ocean the color of outer space rippled all around us. Strange creatures swam in the void. I saw eyeless, worm-like beasts the color of maggots who jumped up from the shimmering waves that stretched to the horizon. Other creatures with the faces like dragonfish and bodies like centipedes skittered over the surface of the black waves, their pale, glossy skin shining with some kind of strange inner light.  
  
Up ahead, a tunnel of blinding white light spiraled at the front of the train. We were moving at such an amazing speed that, by the time I had seen it, we were already going through.   
  
It felt like flying into an exploding supernova. My ears rang with a high-pitched tinnitus. My eyes were temporarily blinded. All I could were spots of color that danced over everything. I blinked fast, leaning against the warm, throbbing wall of the living train.  
  
I looked back out the window, seeing plains of black grass that extended to the horizon under a cold, dark sky. Currents of wind blew thickly through the grass, creating waves that traveled through the night like ripples in a pond. Outside, there was a high-pitched screaming sound, like the wailing of an infant. Looking up, I saw a black hole spinning and shooting out waves of curving, spiraling energy, which gave the only light this strange planet received.  
  
“What’s that horrible sound?” Cook asked, covering his ears and wincing.  
  
“That’s the native grass of the Shadow Plains,” Brother said. “It cries like that constantly. I don’t know if it’s part of its feeding or its mating, but nearly everywhere on the surface, you hear the screaming of the Katcha grass.”  
  
“That’s going to drive me nuts,” I said, shaking my head. “I hope we get out of this place quickly.”  
  
“Well, we still have hours of travel left,” Brother said grimly as his colorless eyes scanned the dark alien plain. “The Shadow Plains are massive, many thousands of miles wide. The Collective Mind lives underneath the ground in subterranean cities that are hewn out of the cold rock of the planet itself.   
  
“They were originally a species of tunnelers, but like with humans, their limbs allowed them to manipulate tools and create technologies. In secret, deep underneath the Shadow Plains, they plotted and researched for thousands of years, strengthening themselves, fusing their consciousness with that of their computers, adding mechanical parts to their bodies until it became impossible to tell where flesh ended and machine began.”  
  
Far off down the train, I heard doors opening with a squelching of flesh. I jumped, looking through the window, feeling panic squeezing my heart. Brother nodded, his face as calm and peaceful as usual, as if he were simply sitting in a restaurant waiting for his food and not in a den of horrors.  
  
“I knew they were coming minutes ago,” he said, raising his rifle. “There’s no running here.” I heard something like gears whirring and a cacophony of siren-like shrieks. I caught a glimpse of what was pushing its way through the train in our direction and repressed an urge to scream.   
  
It stood about six feet tall, with a torso like the trunk of a glossy, black tree. Dozens of thin, boneless arms spiraled around its body with pointed gray blades on the end of each one. Long dark fingers like the roots of a tree twisted through the alien metal, clenching and writhing in chaotic movements. Hundreds of pale eyes on stalks gleamed like moonlight from the top of its head.   
  
I saw many thick, glistening wires like bright blue snakes wrapping around its body. In dozens of places, the wires ate its way into the dark creature’s skin.The blue wires buzzed and lit up with beams of red and blue light that spun through them in a blur. It skittered forward like some sort of giant centipede on hundreds of shivering tentacle-like legs, each about the size of a pencil and a few feet long. Its mouth reminded me of the mouth of some sort of leech or lamprey, with countless tiny, muddy teeth buried in the sucking, wet flesh.  
  
I still had the machete gripped tightly in my hand when a monstrous, cybernetically-enhanced creature gave a whine like a tornado siren. It sounded as if gears and wheels were spinning inside its body, as if a computer were loading with whirring fans. Then it began to speak in English in a voice like a bullhorn. The carriages of the train rocked on their infinite tracks.  
  
“Humans, you are in violation of edict seven of the House of Blades. Surrender immediately. Lay down your weapons,” it blared. It repeated the message in German, French, Chinese and some other languages as it drew nearer, slithering through the dozens of cars of the seemingly endless train. I didn’t know what edict seven or the House of Blades was, but I figured none of it was good news. This strange cyborg now stood only a couple cars away and would reach us in seconds.  
  
Cook still held the warhammer he had stolen from the Necromancer in his hands, and we both still had our small silver daggers stolen from the same armory. In my heart, I was hoping Brother’s gun would simply cut the creature apart like lava and keep the rest of us from having to fight. I didn’t know what kind of weapons these creatures from the Collective Mind might have within their cyborg bodies, though, or whether they could even be killed like a normal lifeform, seeing as they were part computer.  
  
With a steam-whistle cry, the creature crashed through the door into our train. The door opened with a squelching of tissues and fluid. The many eyes of the creature focused on Brother and his smoking rifle. Brother raised it, calmly and smoothly aiming at the creature’s head.  
  
“Surrender!” the thing screamed from its lamprey-like mouth, its many small teeth glistening. The sound also seemed to come from the wires wrapping around and eating their way into its body as well, amplifying with a whine like some sort of feedback loop. Brother bared his teeth in response, his face like a grinning deathshead. Even the alien creature seemed to see the fierceness of the warrior’s grimace, pausing at the door to our carriage, its many slithering tentacles still writhing in place for a long moment as we surveyed each other across the no-man’s land. And though this happened months ago, I still remember the horror of that movement and how time seemed to stop when I lay in my apartment, not sleeping.  
  
The alien made its decision suddenly, but so did Brother. Many things happened very quickly after that, with time like a rushing river pushing us forward.   
  
Brother pulled the trigger. A torrent of fire and burning, liquified lava shot out of the end of his rifle, soaring through the air in a blur towards the creature’s many slug-like cataract eyes. Brother’s killer’s eyes looked as cold as an Arctic glacier as he attacked the alien beast.  
  
The wires wrapping their way up the creature’s body and into its black flesh lit up like a flashbang, emitting a deafening boom and a flash of blinding light. I felt as if I were looking into a near-death experience for a few long moments. The faint screams of someone far away pierced through the ringing like a blade.   
  
As my vision cleared, I saw Jeremiah standing at the end of our group, a burnt, melting mass of liquified fat and seared muscle. His body smoldered like charcoal. The smell of burning hair and cooking meat filled the carriage. He screamed, running in circles for a few seconds before collapsing to the ground, kicking and gurgling. The stub of his arm flailed blindly, his fingers clenching, his smoking eyes blank and horrified as he died.   
  
Even the alien flesh of the train seemed to shiver away from the heat and choking smoke rising up from Jeremiah’s body. I saw something blue and glittery dripping down his body, setting new pieces of exposed gore on flames. I realized that the creature had fired some kind of napalm at us.  
  
The lava from Brother’s rifle covered the creature’s eyes. The pale, lidless orbs dripped and contorted. The stalks that rose up like the stems of mushrooms caught on fire. A sickly blue flame rose from the alien’s flickering, melting body. A smell like burning rubber and scorched metal emanated from the dark smoke.  
  
It gave a scream like a woman being burned alive, a long, high-pitched wail that carried through the train like a tornado siren. Far off in the distance, I heard a faint sound: the same high-pitched banshee wailing being returned.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Cook ran forward with his warhammer, raising it above his head. With an incomprehensible battlecry, he charged at the blinded alien. Its many arms whipped crazily around its body, the long black fingers connected to its many silver blades twisting and clenching in agony. Cook struck out at the nearest of the arms, shattering the limb with a sound like branches snapping in an ice storm.  
  
The alien’s wires started glowing so bright and hot that I could feel the heat across the carriage. In a moment, blue, burning liquid shot out in all directions, spraying like molten metal across the train.  
  
The train’s flesh pulled back, the pink, thrumming mass making a low, pained whispering sound as the blue napalm dripped down its surface with rivers of fire. Cook was sprayed on the foot and leg. Brother fell back and only got a few drops on his hand, while I felt my arm get splashed with drops of my own. Cook screamed in pain, falling back and rolling on the ground.  
  
“Get it off, God, get it off!” he shrieked, ripping at his pants and shoe. “Fuck, it burns! It’s eating through my clothes and skin! Help me!”  
  
The pain was instantaneous for me as well. I bit down hard, repressing an urge to scream. My vision turned white with the heat of it. I smelled my own skin cooking, smelled the burning hair. The adrenaline spike gave me a temporary jolt that overtook the pain. I ran forward with the machete raised, slicing down in the middle of the creature’s tree-like trunk. Its flesh split open and blue blood like that of a crab flowed out, thick and sluggish.  
  
Brother walked calmly forward as the creature fell, not showing any signs of pain. He put his rifle directly to its burnt, wailing head and covered it in magma.  
  
The creature burned for only a few seconds before its screams started to fade and distort. They slowed down, grew deeper and more mechanical. I heard a whirring in its chest. A cloud of hissing hot gas spurted from the thing’s blue wires, smelling of antifreeze and ozone.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
The high-pitched wailing of those cybernetically-enhanced nightmares had closed in on us from both sides when the train’s hissing gurgle of a voice broke through the fog of pain and terror clouding my mind.  
  
“Next stop: The Shadow Plains of the Collective Mind. We will arrive at the central city of Sugguroth within five minutes.” Brother’s pale seemed to go pale at the mention of the city.  
  
I looked outside into the wailing, obsidian grass of the Shadow Plains and the spiraling light of the black hole ripping apart cosmic gas clouds in the sky. I realized that the world outside was not nearly as empty as I thought. Far off in the distance, windowless silver towers rose hundreds of stories into the sky, their shining exterior as sharp and tapering as a spike. Creatures like eyeless lions stalked through the rippling grass, their hides as tough and dark as leather. Instead of eyes, they had dozens of wet holes dripping with clear mucus in their faces that seemed to smell the air around them, opening and closing in a synchronized rhythm.  
  
The train had slowed with a squeal of brakes and a shower of sparks. The flesh all around us seemed to inhale deeply. A sense of rising pressure and humidity filled the living train.  
  
Brother looked at Cook writhing on the ground. The fire had gone out. Cook had ripped off his pants in an attempt to stop the alien napalm from eating its way directly through his body. Deep, angry red welts surrounded blackened and charred necrotic tissue eaten deeply into his flesh. He breathed hard, his face red. The scar from the knife fight he had gotten so long ago shone like a white grimace across his cheek. He pulled himself up into a sitting position, leaning heavily against the wet walls of the train.  
  
“What are we going to do with Cook?” I asked. I glanced over at Jeremiah’s charred, dead body, feeling a sick sense of revulsion rising through my chest. Brother’s cold, colorless eyes surveyed the carnage.  
  
“We may have to run when the doors open,” he said. “Hopefully they’ll follow us. The train usually stops for thirty minutes or so here, as there’s a lot of travel from the Shadow Plains. They sometimes use the train to find new worlds to invade, new species to conquer and dissect and study, and eventually, exterminate like rats.” I looked out into the cold world of this black hole system.  
  
“Can we even survive out there?” I said.  
  
“It’s cold, but yes, we can survive. Shit,” Brother swore, shaking his head. “Everything’s going wrong. The House of Blades.” He sighed, his face lined with countless years of struggle and battle. “That’s the most powerful organization on this planet. The military elites of the Collective Mind, I guess you could say. I think we have a major problem on our hands. If they find us…”  
  
“What was that screaming that thing did?” I asked abruptly, not wanting to know what would happen if we were caught.  
  
“It was calling for help,” he answered. “And help is on its way. But not for us.”  
  
As if to emphasize his words, doors far away from us on both sides slid open, the sound faint and distant. I peered through the glass, seeing more of those monsters from the Collective Mind slithering through the living train, their many pale, lidless eyes searching and wide.
