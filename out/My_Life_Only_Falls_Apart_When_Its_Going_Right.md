I didn’t learn we had a family curse. I reverse-engineered its existence through disaster, the same way astronomers locate a black hole—not by seeing the thing itself, but by watching how violently it bends everything around it into implosion.

Growing up, other families whispered about skeletons in closets. Mine kept filing cabinets instead.

If your life erupted into catastrophe right after a moment of joy, you weren’t pitied—you were processed. My dad would already have the insurance forms halfway filled out. My mom could predict a panic attack like a tide chart. My aunt kept emergency duffel bags labeled not with destinations, but with times: 0–24 hrs, 24–48 hrs, 48–72 hrs.

Because the curse runs on a schedule, not sentiment.

Here’s the thing nobody outside the bloodline understands: it’s not ghosts. Not demons. Not spooky rhyme-book hexes stitched into quilts. It’s causality itself weaponized against us. 

The curse was born when my great-great grandfather made a deal with something that wanted to barter but not be known. 

Family lore says he wanted personal gain—money or leverage or influence, some selfish wish that would make a smaller man ecstatic—and the entity obliged. 

The price? His son would eat the consequences first, and the sons after that, like a generational mortgage paid in misfortune.

Not death. That would be mercifully finite.

No. We inherited inevitability.

Murphy’s law became the mechanic. Loose. Hostile. Unshackled from philosophy and bound to blood contract. Whenever genuine good fortune happens to one of us, the universe spikes the odds for 72 straight hours. 

Anything that can go wrong will, all at once, all cascading, all choreographed by a force that doesn’t show up to take a bow—it  wants the lights to fall from the ceiling in the most embarrassing possible order.

And for three days and nights—exactly—everything malfunctions, misfires, collapses, combusts, or detonates just short of fatal, like it enjoys leaving witnesses but not martyrs.

I was eight the first time it clocked in on me. The announcement was innocent: my mother was pregnant again. A moment of celebration staged by the family dining table, glasses clinking, relatives beaming like the world was still impartial. By adulthood, I’d learn that kind of optimism is classified as an incident, not a memory.

That night came the first bill.

A water pipe ruptured above my bed—not leaking, but bursting, like grammar snapping into verdict. The ceiling light exploded in a spray of sparks that fizzled into harmlessness only because electricity felt like teaching a lesson, not ending the student. My family evacuated calmly because we weren’t surviving a freak accident—we were engaging with a process that had been activated by joy itself.

My dad said, “Just bad luck.”

But nobody calls bad luck at 2:12 a.m. after good news with that kind of unshaken administrative calm.

By thirteen, I stopped wishing birthday candles “worked.” Blown wax spilled into my cake that year because candles, it turns out, are capable of miniature betrayal when the universe wants irony more than pain.

By fifteen, I stopped asking the universe for anything good. I spoke my hopes internally, quietly, like a plea mailed without a return address. The curse listens to joy signals, not whispered shame mail.

My friends, Cal and Jory (weird name, trust me we tease him,) were there for nearly all of it. Two constants dragged along in the disaster wake of something that behaves like a cosmic OSHA violation. Cal thinks he’s a comedian who believes gravity and humiliation are collaborators. If the universe is a stage, Cal insists, he’s obligated to ad-lib. He once stood ankle-deep in floodwater from a storm that drowned nothing but drywall and dignity, squinting upward at the ceiling, and said, without hesitation: “Bro, did your house forget how waterproofing works?”

Jory is different. The loyal type. Silent support built like a sandbag levee made of spine and devotion. When things break around me, Jory doesn’t narrate. He nods once, then immediately starts hauling debris into categories. If he had a tail, it would never stop thumping against the crisis
.
The curse doesn’t target them directly.

But it absolutely appreciates an audience, so long as I’m center stage at the moment of collapse.

When I turned eighteen, it hit like a dissertation defense where the thesis is helplessness.

My aunt raised her glass and said, “To the brightest generation yet!”

Glasses clinked. Birthday declared. Joy detonated into the atmosphere like a starter pistol.

Then the syllabus began.

My laptop battery expanded grotesquely in its shell—a swollen punctuation mark threatening combustion but not granting the release of flame. My bike chain snapped mid-ride on a flat road because optimism had made the hypothesis “What if today is easy?” My car brakes failed on an empty back road, sending me into a  swampy ditch at the most humiliating plausible velocity—fast enough to not be able to react, slow enough to survive its disappointment.

A raccoon gnawed through wiring outside the street transformer. The neighborhood blackout that followed was ruled “wildlife interference.” True, technically. But raccoons don’t file causality paperwork unless compelled by something higher in the org chart.

The boiler malfunctioned the moment anyone might have imagined warm showers could coexist with birthday joy.

Steam burst from the basement like a threat written in condensation. The fridge leaked freon quietly but catastrophically, prompting an evacuation ruled “precautionary,” the same language coroners use when something wants chaos more than corpses.

Then the capstone project: the house fire.

If you’ve never watched probability weaponize a structure, imagine a blaze that behaves not like an inferno, but like the bank auditing your house. It burned long enough to fulfill the 72-hour window. Then—abruptly—the flames self-terminated. No outlet ever confessed. No culprit was ever found. The investigative conclusion was written by people who could not conceptualize causality having personality.

Seventy-two hours.

Three days.

Three nights.

Exactly.

The universe is nothing if not punctual when collecting debt.

Cal tried to joke through the clean-up afterward. “Well hey, listen—it could’ve been worse. At least your house picked a summer-fire vibe and not a winter-hypothermia aesthetic, right?” 

“My fucking basement and kitchen are destroyed. Not the time.” 

Jory said nothing, but his silence was the shape of loyalty’s signature, unflinching as a treaty.

The research phase didn’t start until after my house burned down, weeks after I turned eighteen. The investigators blamed wiring, ruled it accidental, and closed the case fast. 

The universe clocked out precisely at 72 hours like it always does, but the damage stayed. Once you watch your home become a consequence of being happy, curiosity stops being a hobby and becomes an obligation.

It was Jory who suggested we research it seriously. He said it like a person volunteering for something life-ruining but inevitable: “You can’t fight what you don’t understand. Even if understanding doesn’t save you.” 

Cal rolled his eyes hard enough to sprain skepticism, but he still dragged a chair to the table and said, “Fine. If you think something can actually help, we can at least cite our sources like academics.”

We worked out of Jory’s house at first, because mine was a charred absence and an OSHA violation. We used my cracked laptop, notebooks, old family letters saved from the fire by sheer insultingly good timing, and deep-archive digging that Jory treated like a sacred duty and Cal treated like an unending roast battle with the cosmos. 

We downloaded genealogy from Ancestry apps and cross-checked family trees through a family tree website too, because we wanted overlap, confirmation, triangulation—anything that would make this feel like science instead of targeted humiliation.

Cal built a spreadsheet at 3 a.m. called “Cursed shit.” The file had 112 rows of collapses, clustered failures, and joy incidents we traced backwards. Scholarship acceptance → generator explosion. Engagement announcement → medical record corruption. Somebody forgiven → car flipping like an Olympic sport, landing right side up because fatalities aren’t the point, just the lesson.

 We logged every single one of these by trigger age, duration, failure order, witnesses, and escalation severity. The durations were always 72 hours, never a second off. The curse didn’t drift. It is scheduled.

We eventually roped in other sources, including FEMA disaster response reports from events that technically intersected with our area, but never explained anything we were actually experiencing. 

We combed through the files anyway, matching timelines with curse windows, because our hypothesis was that the curse might ride major events like slipstreams, using larger chaos to feather its smaller humiliations. 

We found lightning storms that knocked out power grids, car recalls that matched brake failures, and wildlife reports that suspiciously peaked at the same time houses decided to audition for arson. But none of these lines converged tightly enough to indict anything other than a pattern of debt enforcement.

I did the contract research myself, because I needed someone to blame more dimensional than a raccoon, and Jory needed sleep but refused it. We dug into pact structure without mysticism: deals that punish descendants, not the signee; generational contract enforcement theory; probability corruption as a clause, not an aesthetic; folklore about pacts that lack symbols, motifs, or spiritual theatrics. 

We scraped essays, academic papers, digitized archives, and anthropology breakpoints, filtering for cases where coincidence wasn’t random, but jurisdictional. Jory bookmarked everything in a browser folder titled “Inheritance Hostility” like a man auditioning for sainthood by filing.

The conclusion we came to was almost offensively clean: the curse has no symbol because it needs none. No name because it files nameless. No object anchor because anchors require seams and screws. Ours lives in blood and responds only when something good happens—joy as a trigger, coincidence as a weapon, inevitability as a schedule.

We stared at that conclusion long enough that it felt like staring into a server rack full of doomed outcomes. Cal eventually said, quieter than normal, “So… nothing good can ever happen without a three-day apocalypse following, huh?” Jory just nodded once, eyes steady, like agreeing with Cal counted as first aid instead of surrender.

I learned then that research can give you power in most stories. In ours, it only gives us clarity, and clarity has a steep emotional APR. Breaking probability is impossible. Suing causality is impossible. The only currency that ever mattered to the deal was me, celebrating something good, and paying for it in frameworks that collapse, structures that misbehave, and futures that don’t bother becoming ghosts because humiliation is more efficient than haunting.

Signed in blood. Notarized in probability. Enforced through inevitability.

By twenty-one, I realized my entire life philosophy had inverted itself like a compass pointing south out of spite: most people dream bigger with age.

I began dreaming smaller in defense.

I’d rather fail gently on my own terms than succeed for a moment and have the universe organize 72 hours of escalating betrayal around the idea of happiness.

Even now, when something good accidentally slips into my life—a job, a smile, a moment of warmth—I don’t celebrate. I don’t indulge in the joy long enough to mature into the atmosphere. I fold it into myself quietly, like smuggling a lit match through a metal detector calibrated for grief.

The curse is still there.

Waiting for the next joy signal.

It doesn’t want bodies.

It wants proof I still believe anything good could happen at all. And I refuse to give it the satisfaction of applause.

If anyone knows anything even slightly related, let me know. Either way, I’m not getting my hopes up.
