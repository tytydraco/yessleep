It started pretty normal. Just another one of those dreams you wake up from wishing they were real. For me, those are always about love. Nothing explicit honestly, I’ve never even dreamt of kissing anyone. It’s just the feeling. A girl, the warmth of connection, and then it’s gone the second I open my eyes.

But this time was different.

When I “woke up” in the dream, I was sitting on the floor in front of a black leather couch. It felt like a party, people laughing, drinking, music in the background. Then I noticed her. Brown hair, olive skin, sitting quietly like she was waiting for something.

Eventually, the room emptied until it was just me and her. We started talking. Normally, I suck at conversation, but in this dream it felt… easy. Like the words were already prepared for me. It was my dream after all.

At one point, I joked, “So… who do you think’s gonna make out first?”

She smirked and said, “I don’t know. Maybe us?”

I sat next to her. She rested her head on my lap. I leaned in. And right before we kissed—

My alarm. 6:30 a.m. Time for work.

I swore out loud when I woke up. I couldn’t shake the dream all morning.

I work as a cashier at a grocery store. Nothing glamorous. I finished high school but couldn’t afford college. My grades weren’t great anyway. My only real friend there is Matt—my age, stoner type, but generally chill.

I was on my smoke break when I told him about the dream. He grinned and said, “Dude, maybe you could go back.”

I laughed. “Yeah? How?”

"Let's say I know a guy who knows a guy."

"I'm not doing weed." I interjected.

"Not weed man, that's middle school stuff. I'm talking real, MK ULTRA mind bending stuff."

"Right and how would that help me?" I asked not expecting a serious answer.

"Well this dude, he got a pill for dreams too, he'll even give it for cheap if I put in a word you're my friend."

I thought he was joking, but he gave me a number.
At first, I didn’t call. It was stupid. Buying drugs just to chase some dream girl? No thanks.

But then it happened again. The exact same dream. Same couch. Same girl. Same alarm ripping me out at the same moment. I ignored it, must be a weird coincidence.
Then it happened a third time.

Only on the third night, it was Saturday. My alarm wasn’t even set. Something else had woken me up.

By Sunday, it was unbearable. The “alarm” was so loud it felt like it was drilling into my skull, and again no alarm set.
By Monday, I looked like a zombie at work. Matt saw me and said again: “Talk to my guy.”

And I did.

Next day, though Matt, I got myself a little yellow pill.
That night, I dissolved said little yellow pill in vodka and drank it down. Nothing happened. For a moment I thought I’d been scammed.

Then I fell asleep.

Same couch. Same girl. Except this time we kissed.
And I haven’t woken up since.

It’s been… days? Maybe longer. At first, it was perfect. We kissed, we laughed, we held each other. But eventually, we realized there are no doors here. No windows. Just the couch and a few party lights.

No food. No water. No way out.

And no way to wake up.
I can’t even sleep inside the dream. I tried. It doesn’t work. I've grown exhausted.

She’s crying now. I never asked her name. I don’t think I want to.

It’s been over a week. I’m dehydrated to the point of collapse. Somehow my phone battery hasn’t died. That’s how I’m writing this.

I've tried to smash my head on the walls, it hurts a lot but I can't seem to get knocked out, I just can't.

This is my last shot at reaching anyone. If you’re reading this, find Matt. He knows where I live. Make him tell you.

Please.

Help me.

Help her.

Because I think I'm about to do something awful, I just need the blood, her blood.
