You know how everyone, when they’re a kid, has that one thing they’re scared of, but no one really knows why? It might be the cupboard at their grandma’s house, the clock they had in their room, the back of their shed – no matter how specific or how bizarre, everyone had one. For me, well – it was the shower drain.

As a kid in the early naughties in regional Queensland, playing in the drains and pipes and stormwater ditches was par for the course. Dangerous, for sure, but no one thought much of it. Common sense, you hoped, would prevail, and no one would be stupid enough to go too far in or splash around during a cyclone. Of course, that wasn’t always the case – every few years, at least one person, usually a preteen with more bravado than brains, went missing in the storm season. Friends last saw him playing in the old storm drain near the sugar mill, or he told his mum he was riding his bike off to the edge of the weir to hang out with mates. This was normal, expected, even. Not for me, though. I hated it, the idea of being sucked away, of being thrust down a concrete pipe and into murky depths, suffocated by darkness and slime and churned up by the stormwater. It made it a little more challenging to have as many friends as I would have liked, but I found a few kind enough to accept my fear and we kept ourselves away. There was plenty else to do, besides. However, my fear didn’t just extend to the hungry maws of pitch black that gulped down stormwater with all the fervour of a starved beast, the unknowable corridors of drainage and filtration that carried stormwater away from our houses.

My fear was consistent. Drains, in general, gave me the creeps. Especially the shower drain in our main bathroom. Small, brass, rusted, always tangled with some sort of hair or cloth or dirt, the slimy epicentre would watch me as I washed dirt down its gullet. I always felt it must get frustrated at us, that it must hate us, for always force-feeding it our grime and sweat and urine and hair. When I had showers, I squashed myself against the cold tile wall on the other end of the tub as much as I could, using the detachable showerhead to keep as much clearance as possible. In truth, I stopped thinking about this habit by the time I reached my late childhood – I just did it. Even in other people’s showers, the aversion wasn’t quite as distinct, but I always went out of my way to avoid touching or standing directly over their shower drains. At times, when my imagination – which my mum would always say ‘ran wild’ – took me into the slick depths, I couldn’t help but think of the missing people in our drainage system. I don’t know if that’s how it works, if the storm drains and our showers are part of the same network and if they ever intersect, but in my mind, it was. If I were to shrink down and crawl through those pipes into the darkness below I would find myself face-to-face with the bloated memories of a kid that thought himself invincible. In short, I hated drains, and this fear stuck with me through most of my youth. It wasn’t until the summer of ’09, not too long past my 14th birthday, that my anxieties made sense.

A night alone. I was 14 now, and according to my parents, old enough to look after myself. They’d gone to... something. A coworker’s 50th? A cousin’s engagement party? Something like that. All I know I that mum had her only dress on – mid-length, red, flowing – and my Dad had shaved for the first time in forever. They’d walked out the door with a bottle of cab-sav or two tucked under their arms and told me they’d be back by 11, that there was cash for pizza on the countertop. No big deal, I thought. A few hours on my own, Xbox for company, too much pizza stuffed down my gob, I’d send myself into the weekend in a card-fuelled haze. The plan went off seamlessly, for a few hours. As the red digits on the digital alarm clock – you know the one, dark green, rectangular plastic, convex glass screen with aggressive red numbers, all parents had one – neared the doubles, I figured I should start to clean up for the night. 

9:53. I remember that. It was 9:53 when I beeped off my Xbox, flicked on my lights, dropped my drawers and started the shower. The pipes hissed as they always did, a squealing protest as I turned the heat way up until the pressure equalised (according to my dad) and it finally shut up. As I stepped through the curtain of steam onto the still frigid coral pink porcelain of the tub, I felt for the first time that I was alone. I hadn’t felt it before, immersed in digital alien landscapes and warmed by the pizza box on my lap, but now in the uncaring fluorescence of the bathroom, I felt alone. The room quickly filled up with steam and I couldn’t see myself in the mirror, or anything far from me, to be honest. I liked my showers that way – hot enough to boil a lobster, in my mum’s words. I did my usual dance without thinking, hugging the tile wall and spraying myself with the slick black showerhead held aloft in my hands, subconsciously careful to avoid the grasping darkness of the drain. As I felt the feeling of loneliness wash from my skin into my peripheral nightmares, there was a sudden and deafening thump. I froze in place, looking around frantically. It sounded like it came from the floor of the tub, so I naturally assumed I’d knocked over my mum’s weird-shaped fruit shampoo bottle again – but I hadn’t. There was nothing on the floor, and as I stood back up from my search, the thump came again, louder this time. Definitely from below, as my feet had vibrated and I almost felt myself topple over with the shudder. I cursed to myself, and with my heart racing, I scrambled to step out of the tub. I knew it, I knew it wasn’t safe to be alone with the drain like that.

With an ungraceful flop and a crack of my knee against the edges, I fell out of the tub and came to rest against the sharp edges of the vanity countertop, wincing from the pain. For a moment, the room was still, punctuated only by the sharp piercing of the water against the tub. Then, as suddenly as the first two, there came another thump, one that sent vibrations through my bones and toppled all the bottles of soap and shampoo both in the shower and around the sink. With a whispered ‘nope, nope, nope’ I scrambled to wrap a towel around my waist and get out of there as fast as I could. My frantic panting and shaking hands hindered the process, which eventually came to a sharp end when the light went out. Darkness. With more panicked cursing and terrified trembling, I held up my towel with one hand and fumbled for the light switch with the other. As I stepped, I felt my legs give out as my foot slid away from me. The floor was wet, and I let out a yelp as my tailbone cracked down onto the tiles. In total darkness, spine throbbing, heart racing, I felt my throat close up and my bones turn to jelly as my body refused to stand up as I ordered it to. I sat there, hopelessly, for what felt like hours but was likely only a minute or two, before the lights came flashing back on, blinding me. 

As terrible as the darkness was, I really wish they hadn’t turned on. Now I could see the floor of my bathroom coated in a thick black slime, puddles of water and piles of soggy, mouldy detritus piled around the base of the tub, which was also overflowing with the same unidentifiable muck. Maybe it was more than a few minutes, for the tub to fill up like that. The thumping returned, this time coming from all around me, and in a rapid sequence. Thump thump thump thump thump thump. It was almost in time with my heart, which felt like it was about to burst through my chest and strangle me. Not knowing what else to do, I pressed my hands over my ears, squeezed my eyes shut, and smacked my head against my vanity cupboard. I roared for the thumping to shut up, shut up, shut up! Then it did. Silence fell once more. 

As I opened my eyes, the bathroom was well-lit, dry, and silent. That was impossible – moments earlier, I’d been surrounded by piles of sludge and slime and mould and goop, in a bathroom that thumped like a heart. There was no trace of the nightmare to be seen as I shakily brought myself to my feet. The shower was still running, though gently, a soft stream of water lapping at the porcelain. I had to turn it off, or mum would kill me. The tiles clung onto the cold stillness of the night as I took a deep breath, and stepped towards the shower, the unassuming black curtain hanging limply from the rusted tension rod. With a gulp, I grabbed the curtain that gave a screech along the metal, and wrenched it open. Immediately, I was met with the face of another boy, leaning right in close and grinning.

“Hello,” he said sharply. With another yelp I fell backwards, hitting my tailbone again on the vanity but managing to stay standing. The boy before me was a strange looking creature – skin a sickly blue-grey, hair sticking to his wet scalp in slimy clumps, his body unclothed but draped in large pockets of muck and mould that seemed to cover him all over. He let out a light chuckle and I caught a look at his teeth, mismatched and uneven, some small, some  large, some yellow or brown and others pearly white, arranged in a loose pattern of jagged zigzags along his sickening pink gums. “Sorry to scare you, Billy”. He said through the chuckling. His voice sounded like bubbles on the surface of a pool, like if you ducked your head underwater in a spa bath, and he said a name that wasn’t mine as he apologised. In my shock and pain and terror, my stupidly level head answered with, “My name’s not Billy”. As if it mattered what this swamp monster called me. He tutted and shook his head, letting out another laugh.

“Sorry. That’s my name, I think. I read somewhere that it was Billy Keoghan, and that sounds about right,” he postulated. Billy Keoghan. Familiar, somehow. With a shaking step, I moved slightly closer to the boy, intrigued and terrified in almost equal measure.

“What do you want, Billy? Where did you come from?” I asked him, eyeing him up and down, his body malformed and lumpy like a child’s plasticene model that was dropped in a puddle. I was at the same time feeling on the bench behind me for something, anything at all that I could use to get away if I needed to.

“I think you know where I came from,” he responded jovially, gesturing to the drain right near his feet. “As for what I want, well – that’s easy”, he continued with a shrug. My hand found my dad’s razor, folded up steel inside a slick wooden handle. I kept my eyes locked with his, those sewerage-green orbs sunken deep inside his greywater flesh. “I want friends. It’s so lonely down there. Especially when everyone is afraid to come near you,” he went on, his voice dropping low and his face softening. As sick as it is, as horrendous and impossible as the sight in front of me was, I found myself almost feeling sorry for him. Keoghan. Why is it familiar? He must be so lonely, stuck down there, I thought. I know how much I would hate to be in the drains like that. I gulped, and continued the conversation as best I could with my shaking voice.

“I get that. I do. But no one is afraid of you, of your home – only I am,” I questioned, recalling all the summer middays where the most popular boys and the coolest girls from school would go for dips in the drainpipes while I was up on dry land, tormenting an ant hill or kicking a pinecone across the dirt road. He scoffed, I think, a sound like water draining from a bathtub.

“They’re all terrified. They just put up with it for the sake of a bit of fun – that’s what I used to do. But no one would dare go near the true drains, the openings into the tunnels. Except me – I did, one day.” He reminisced as he seemed to take in a deep breath and let it out as a watery gurgle. Billy Keoghan. I remember now – two years ago, a young boy about my age got sucked into a drainpipe as he played and the storm started up again. The suction pulled him in, and his body was never found in any of the outlets or dams. Everyone else that had gone missing turned up eventually, facedown and bloated in a river or a dam. But not Billy. Billy was never seen again – until now, in my bathroom on a Friday night in August. I hadn’t realised it, but I’d been walking towards him ever so slowly, razor held loosely in my hand behind my back. I suddenly looked around, and saw that my feet were at the edge of the tub. We were close, now, and I could smell him, a stench like a pool with a broken filter.

“I’m sorry, Billy. I’m sorry you had to go through that, all alone, scared, suffocating…” I trailed off in a soft voice as I leaned in closer to him, shins pressing against the edges of the tub. “I’m sorry you have no friends…” I raised my free hand to rest on his cheek, a squelch responding to my touch. In an instant, his face changed, flashed into a twisted rage and joy, teeth bared wide and eyes aglow.

“Gotcha,” he snapped as he let out a sickening laugh. He grabbed my arm with his and pulled me forwards, and we both tumbled onto the floor of the shower and I fell onto him, slime and sludge and hair sticking to me. He was coughing and laughing as we struggled, one hand unfurling the razor and the other pushing his head down towards the drain. “I thought we could be friends!” He hissed as I struck him in the jaw with my hand.

“Shut up and go back to your drainpipe,” I gritted my teeth in rage and pain as I felt his hands and feet lay into me as I tried to pin him down. After a few more moments of tension and struggle, I managed to slide the razorblade across his throat. A high velocity spray of the foulest water I have ever seen erupted from his wound, seeping into my mouth and eyes with a putrid tenacity as he gurgled and fell limp. I saw his body fall still, and one by one his features turned liquid, his hair and eyes and teeth splashing to the floor and slowly seeping down the drain. Razor in my hand, I sat on all fours in my bathtub, shower still spraying me with hot water, staring down into the drain.

The vindication was all I needed, really. Drains were dangerous, and I knew it all along. Now, with my son holding my hand as we strolled through the park, I can say with absolute certainty that I will never, ever let him play in storm drains.
