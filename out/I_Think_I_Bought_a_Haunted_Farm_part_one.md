Alright, I’ve never posted one of these before, but my roommate suggested that it’d be a good idea to “immortalize” what’s going on. My names Maddox (21M), and I bought an old farm in the middle-of-nowhere Appalachia. My housemate, I guess, is my childhood friend and ex Roslyn (20F), and we’ve been here for roughly 5 months now. The both of us had been living together for a year with two other roommates in our old apartment in KY, shit went wrong with our roommates, and the both of us decided we wanted out. This is what led us to buy this shitty farm.

We agreed we wanted a farm, she wanted horses again, and I wanted goats. We found an old farmhouse with an attached 20 acres and barn. Now, when I tell you the price, I don’t wanna hear the bitching, looking back we should have been more wary, but we really just wanted out and didn’t wanna move back in with our parents. The woman was only asking $165,000 for the house, and after visiting the place, we bought it. If I had known what was in store, I’d of just moved back in with my parents.

At first, everything was fine unless you really started looking. It was a two-story house, 4 bed, 2 bath with a small attic space. I took one of the upstairs bedrooms, and Roslyn took one of the downstairs. The house was old but had clearly been updated a little bit in the past year or so. Roslyn volunteered to check out the attic once we moved in, obsessed with the idea that there’d be something up there. I should’ve knocked on wood because sure enough, she brought down a cardboard box packed full of papers and books.

Roslyn said the attic was weird to put it lightly. Her exact words were: “It’s fucking weird up there, it’s June, and it’s like 50-some degrees up there. Have you been up there yet?? It clearly ain’t been cleaned out since forever ago. Old kid toys, a tiny ass iron bed, and wallpaper peeling off the walls. It’s creepy as hell, we’ve gotta redo it before we store stuff up there.” Roslyn isn’t exactly the sensitive type. We went through the box for a few days while eating some sorta takeout meal. Some of the papers were kids' drawings, and a lot of the books were either kids' books or journals. Honestly, that’s all a story for another time. We’re just using a spare room for storage and have more or less sealed off the attic for now.

If you exclude the attic, there’s only one other weird place in the house, the third bedroom. It’s furnished but doesn’t have anyone staying in it. The room itself is fine, I guess, but it’s the chair in the corner. That corner always seems so damn dark, and when it’s late at night, I swear there’s someone rummaging around the room. It’s just me and Roslyn, plus our dogs and cat, not a soul is in that room though. I set some rat and mouse traps since Mazie, Roslyn’s cat, had caught a mouse the other day. We’re hoping that it’s just rats in the room, or the house itself. I’d argue it’s a better alternative to what Roslyn swears it is.

Roughly 2 months into living here, we finally tackled the barn. Well, I finally tackled the barn. Roslyn works full-time at the thrift store in town, while I’m part-time at the garage in town. The barn is the most normal part of the property so far, aside from the ever-present dust and grim in some places. The barn’s got two large stalls on the right side and then some smaller individual stalls on the left, and then two additional rooms which I’ll be using for feed & tack once we get our animals. There’s a loft, and it’s the spot I can just about never get cleaned. I’ll clean it one day, and then the next day it's covered back up in dust again. I’ve decided I’ll just build onto the barn for hay, it ain’t worth the fight of constantly cleaning it. After making sure everything was stable enough and patching up one of the pasture’s fences, I finally got my goats.

I got one billy and two nans, and yes, for the time being, I’m keeping them together. The billy’s white with blue eyes and his name’s Roger. The youngest nan is brown dappled with blue eyes, and her name’s Lula, while the other is tricolored with brown and blue eyes and her name’s Willow. They’re all pretty well-behaved, and Roslyn likes them too. The only thing is, they refuse to go outside once it gets dark. One night I was late getting home from town, and they smashed a hole in the door trying to get into the barn. It was a nice night, and they have a shed out in their pasture anyway. I still have no clue what spooked them so bad. I plan on getting a Pyrenees for them just to be safe.

Just the other evening, Roslyn and I were sitting on the back porch. We were watching the goats graze, and the dogs run around; it was nice and peaceful. That’s when Roslyn had mentioned something. Deer. Actually, any wildlife, for that matter. For some reason, we almost never saw anything in the backyard aside from what we owned. We never saw any deer, raccoons, opossums, nothing. We’d see them in the front yard but never the back. Considering the backyard is closer to the woods, you’d assume there’d be some sort of wildlife, but apparently not. It’s weird when you think about it. If you’re real quiet, you can’t even hear the birds in the backyard, not really. You can hear distant whistles, but that’s about it.

I don’t know, Roslyn is convinced that there’s something weird going on here, but I think there’s gotta be some sorta explanation. We’re talking about looking for a third roommate, plus we gotta get another dog. Roslyn agrees getting a big dog to stay in the barn would be best before we get anymore animals. I’ll update y’all if anything else happens, but hopefully it won’t, honestly. Alright, God bless. Y’all stay safe out there.
