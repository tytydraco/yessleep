Right from my childhood I was a guy who had a keen interest in the paranormal. More specifically the Japanese horror. I am in love with Japan. The culture, the streets and more specifically the stories it held within. It was on my 12th birthday that I demanded my parents for a book on Japanese urban legends and ghost stories. I still remember the happiness I felt when i received that book. From then my love for the paranormal increased rapidly. I decided that for once in my life i would vist Japan and do some research on it's paranormal stories. And finally the day came!

I was 26 when i got a chance to visit Japan. Now the majority of Japanese urban legends and ghost stories are one way or the other connected to old shrines. And so right after i reached my hotel i started my research on some old and apparently haunted shrines. I even had some conversations with the hotel manager and to my surprise he was a big paranormal enthusiast too. He mentioned some location near my hotel where I could find some haunted shrines and promised me that he would accompany too. For anonymity i will call him "Mr B"

As soon as the clock struck midnight. I and Mr B went to visit the nearest shrine in Mr B's car. Like always i was totally exited to do some real ghost haunting stuff. But soon i would realise that it would turn out to be the biggest mistake in my life.

Mr B and I reached our destination just after a one hour drive. The shrine was located above a hill where we can't drive our car. So we decided that we'll walk up the path , have a quick look at the shrine, pray to the kami-sama (god) and then return back to our hotel. As we were walking up the hill i noticed that it was oddly quite around but i ignored it and walked along the path. Soon we reached the shrine and at first glance it was the most beautiful yet terrifying shrine I've ever seen in my life. We walked around the shrine, prayed to the kami-sama and was about to leave when we heard someone giggling infront of us. I looked at Mr B and asked, " Did you hear that!"

It seems Mr B knew something about the source of this sound as he was shivering with sweat running all throughout his body. I Asked again, "Mr B what happened, did you hear that sound?" Mr B looked at me with bloodshot eyes and said " This is really bad man. We should've never come to this place at night. It's a yokai, a spirit who kills people who dared to enter its territory and â€” right as he was able to tell something, someone gripped my hand and tossed me in the air as if i were a ball. I dropped to the ground with a loud bang and was unable to stand. As i sat there i looked up and a shiver ran down my spine. Infront of me was a giant 8 feet tall lady with her face covered behind her hairs. She was unnaturally thin and was wearing a white torn down kimono. She giggled as she dropped me and started to approach towards Mr B. 

Mr B at once took something out of his pocket and threw it towards the creature which made it shout in pain and agony. Seeing the opportunity Mr B  picked me up and at once we ran down the hill towards our car. Luckily the creature was not chasing us, or so we thought. As we were about to reach the car we saw the creature running towards us in an unnatural manner and was about to reach us. But somehow we managed to dodge her a drove away from the hill.

But as soon as the car was about to reach the road. The girl caught up to us and pulled Mr B out of the car window. I was sure that her next target would be me so i jumped out of the car and ran from the towards and empty Village road.

Currently I'm hiding under the bed of an rundown house. This is my last story. I don't know if I'll be able to make it out. But its funny thsr I'm still hearing the creature giggling voice behind me. I'm gonna turn around to look...!
