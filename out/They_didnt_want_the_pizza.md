I clocked into my shift, I prepared to deliver some pizzas in the dark. It was like any ordinary shift at this pizza joint. We were open till midnight. I had prepared myself some extra sleep so I had some leftover energy to deliver pizzas all night. I only worked here on the weekends and it also pays good for night shifts which is the only reason I work here so late. I sighed in dissapointment as the other employee hadn't shown up for the second time again.

"I might need to ask my employer to fire them." I thought

I thought about it again and realized he worked weekdays so I might have to work weekdays and weekends. While I was waiting I got a phone call. I eagerly picked the phone and answered:

\*\*\*\*

"Welcome to Dylan's Pizzeria, how may I help you?"

"I'd like a thin crust, cheese pizza, topped with olives and green peppers." They said​

"Anything else?" I responded

"I'd also like a two liter soda."

"Anything else?" I replied

"No thanks." They said

"That'll be 12.99 and it will take approximately three hours." I said

(They told me their address and what street the live on before I hung up)

\*\*\*\*

I told the chef who works lunch/dinner to make the pizza the caller asked before getting another phone call. This process went on for hours until one peculiar delivery...

When I arrived to the house I noticed something was off... The address was the same as the first pizza caller's address.. Before I could question it an elderly woman came out of the door​ with some cash and a walker.

"Oh boy, an appetizer!" The woman said

She sounded awfully different from the caller I heard on the phone.

She handed me the cash and I handed her the pizza as she went back inside into her house, closing the door.

What's worse is she didn't give me a tip.

I hopped on and drove off back to the pizzeria with my moped.

When I got back to the pizzeria, I noticed the first caller's pizza was finally done so I took it and the drink then got back on my moped. I was tired but eager to go home because this was the last order I had to take before the pizzeria closed.

As I got to the same house I visited earlier, I was instead greeted by a different person that sounded like the person who ordered the pizza and the drink. Instead of handing me the cash like usual he said:

"Look kid, I'm tired and I'm too old to carry this drink so I need you to go inside and put it on the table, I'll give you a one-hundred dollar tip if you do help me."

I was poor already and I could use an extra buck or two, so I agreed and carried the stuff into his house. His house awfully smelled like a rotting corpse, but I ignored it and walked towards the door of the dining room, there I found five children, the grandma, a baby, a mom and dad beside the baby and the parts of the corpse of my co-worker in his pizza delivery uniform on their dinner plate. In utmost fear and disgust, I screamed and chucked the drink at the caller before heading out of the door and onto my moped. I sped off to the local police station and reported what I just saw. I then closed down the restaurant before going to my apartment and locking the door behind me.

The next morning, I texted my boss about the incident and quit to pursue a new career.

I was also informed by the police that there were multiple reports of missing people in several different towns and that I was just lucky enough to make it out alive.

This incident still scares me today and I am taking therapy to try and forget about it, I sometimes take drugs so I can doze off and not remember what I had just seen.
