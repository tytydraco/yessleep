2011, I remember it like it was yesterday. I was a young Pakistani man, more like a boy actually, and I had just arrived in Mississauga, a city often overshadowed by its close by neighbour Toronto.

It was a cool living in Canada, literally, I had to shovel the snow every day, something which never happened back home.

I met many people from diverse backgrounds, some who struggled to speak English just like me. Despite this, everyone was always friendly with everyone, and we kind of understood each other without having to say anything.

The Canadian life was alluring. I was particularly fascinated in the party culture, something which didn’t really happen in my village.

Nonetheless, I came to Canada to study, not to wild out with the homies, and I knew if my parents saw my transcript and saw anything below a 90, I would be sent back to my country.

I was to be there for four years, until I got my degree in accounting from Sheridan College, a prestigious institution located in Oakville Ontario. 

During those four years I met many people from a wide range of backgrounds. Amongst them was Mansi, an Indian student who helped me with my English. The two of us became friends and I eventually developed a crush on her.

Mansi had two sides to her, one was that she was an excellent student. She would always raise her hand in class, she would get 90’s or higher, and she would help students who struggled with the subject.

Despite this, Mansi was no nerd. In fact, she was the exact opposite. Mansi was an outgoing extrovert. She was 5’8” (an inch taller than me), and she would come to college on a motorcycle.

Mansi also loved to party. She was everything I wanted to be. I was almost jealous of her, knowing she could enjoy her life and still pull good grades, meanwhile I had to push myself to get that 80.

Time, is a cruel thing, something which I learned that year.

You see, those four years came, and those four years went. I didn’t party or enjoy really, I came there with a purpose, to study and go home, and I was going to do just that.

It was the last year of college, last semester. I was reading my notes in my room when suddenly I heard a notification go off.

I checked my phone, it was Mansi. My heart skipped a beat.

“Hey Ali, what you doing?”.

“Oh, just studying for the Economics exam”.

I saw the three dots bounce in the iMessage app, and then nothing, I was left on read. 

I went back to studying when suddenly I heard my phone ring. It was Mansi, and it wasn’t a phone call, it was actually FaceTime. 

I opened the app and we chatted a bit.

The two of us started talking about accounting, but eventually the conversation devolved, and we started making fun of this one professor we had. The two of us laughed and laughed and eventually we just stopped and stayed in silence. I waited for her to end the call, but she just stayed there. It was like neither of us wanted to end the call and were waiting for the other. Eventually, Mansi broke the silence.

“Hey … Ali, can I ask you something?”.

“Yeah …” I said in a nervous tone.

“Actually … I wanna say it you in person”.

“Oh, so when do you want to meet?”.

“There’s a party on April 24, starting at 5 pm.”.

“Oh … but the Economics exam is on the same day, and it starts at 7”.

“I know, but the place is close to our college, and I’ll personally drop you off to the College on my bike”.

“Oh, alright” I said shyly.

“Alright, goodnight”.

“Goodnight”.

That night I couldn’t sleep. I laid in bed wondering what Mansi wanted to say to me.

It was my last few weeks in Canada, and the last time I’d get to see this girl, who knows what she was going to say. And I wouldn’t even be able to completely enjoy the moment since there was an exam right after it.

If only I had more time.

Time is such a cruel thing, something I was about to learn.

A week later it was finally here, April 24. I woke up and noticed my clock said 3:34, despite it clearly being morning time.

Had time frozen? 

Of course not, my clock just stopped working. I checked my phone and it said 11:00 am. I guess that’s what happens when you wake up the entire night thinking about your crush.

I went on with my day, studied a bit while the new coverage of the 2015 Canadian elections was going on. 

Eventually Mansi sent me a text.

“You ready for the party?”

“Yeah, where is it by the way?”

“Don’t worry about it, I’ll pick you up”.

About 20 minutes later, I heard the doorbell, it was Mansi.

“Hey, looking gorgeous” I said, almost immediately regretting it.

Mansi smiled and winked at me.

I sat with her on her motorcycle.

After 15 minutes we arrived to what looked like a college, similar to our own Sheridan College.

“Hmmm, strange, I’ve never seen this place before, and it’s so close to our college”.

Mansi looked at me.

“It’s actually the first time I’ve been here too”.

“So, who’s the host, your friend?”.

“I don’t know”.

“What do you mean you don’t know” I said laughing, thinking Mansi was joking.

Actually, I got an email by someone, and all the email said was “Party, 5:00, April 24 2015”. 

What the fuck? Why would you even show up to this place?

“It’s because nobody knows my personal email except my family and friends, so I was wondering which friend it was” …

“I tried sending an email back but got no answer”. 

That’s why I wanted you to come with me, Ali. Just in case … you know … something weird happens.”

“Oh … so that’s what you wanted to tell me”.

“Yeah … what did you think?”.

“Uh … nothing, let’s go in” I said, rolling my eyes.

We knocked the door. 

It opened, and there was a bright flash of light that damn near blinded us.

We both covered our eyes, after I could see again, I asked Mansi if she was ok. She nodded rubbing her eyes.

We went inside and were greeted by a redheaded guy, wearing a tie dye shirt.

“Hey homeboy, my name is Todd, say, I’ve never seen you guys before, are you new here”.

At first, I thought it was a racial remark, but then Todd added “which College are you guys from?”. 

“Sheridan, Mansi said” 

Todd looked at us strange and then walked away.

“Mansi, do you know this guy” I said.

“No, who is he, in fact, who are any of these people?”.

I looked around, nobody looking remotely familiar.

“No clue, you wanna just go back to Sheridan?”.

“Wait, I wanna see if it’s one of my friends playing a prank on me”. 

Suddenly a group of girls came by and asked Mansi to join them. Mansi reluctantly joined them.

I questioned whether I should leave or not, thinking if it would be right to leave Mansi alone.

But was she really alone? There are so many people here. Plus, Mansi can handle herself, she probably has more balls than me. Not to mention, I could get some extra time to practice for my Economics exam.

I told myself these things, but deep down I knew the real reason was I was hurt. I was hurt Mansi was only using me as her bodyguard, and the embarrassment was so much I had to leave. 

I headed towards the door when I heard someone screaming “Yo! Yo! Come here, I need to talk to you”.

An east Asian guy wearing a yellow shirt and glasses approached me.

I looked at him, but before he could say anything Todd came up to him and said “let’s grab a drink”. 

“Let go of me Todd” the guy protested. 

Please note that I’m 5’7”, which is pretty small, but this guy was even shorter and smaller than me. He was easily overpowered by Todd who took him away.

“What was that all about?” I thought. “Meh, not my problem”.

I headed towards the door. I pulled it open and it didn’t budge.

“Ah, silly me, it’s push not pull”.

I pushed the door but it still wouldn’t open.

“What gives?”.

I looked around for someone to help.

“Dude, come here for a second, we need to take the school photo”.

I looked behind me and saw a tall bald guy.

He pulled me with him.

“But I’m not in your school?”

“Which College do you go to?” he asked.

“Sheridan College” I replied.

“Yeah, so we are from the same College” 

“What?”. 

I thought he was probably drunk and just went along with it.

I stood with a group of guys and was put in the front with Todd, us both being shorter. On the other side of Todd was the shortest, the yellow shirt guy, who kept staring at me.

I looked at him and said “U Wot M8” in my mind (remember that meme, 2015 was a funny year).

“Everyone look at the camera”, said the bald guy.

I saw a 1980s looking camera.

“Why don’t you just use your phone” I asked the bald guy.

“What, are you drunk” Todd said laughing.

Then everyone except for me and the guy in the yellow shirt laughed.

“What a bunch of weirdos” I thought, half creeped out and half amused.

After the photo was taken, everyone dispersed.

I walked up to the vintage looking camera.

“F3 Nixon” it read (so a Nixon F3). 

Something was off about the situation. Not just the fact that people were using this antique in 2015, but the fact it was in such good quality, as if it were brand new.

I went up to it, and looked in the camera screen, there was a video being recorded.

I read the date “April 24, 1980”.

“Hmm … looks like they forgot to fix the year”.

I was so bored I decided to fix the date on the camera myself. I went into the settings and tried to fix the year, but the year wouldn’t go past 1980.

“Strange, piece of junk” I thought to myself.

My thoughts were interrupted by a tap on my shoulder.

It was the guy in the yellow shirt.

I asked him if he could help me with the door, something which I momentarily forgot due to the school photo. 

“The door won’t open” he said.

“Yeah, that’s the problem” I replied. 

“You don’t understand, the door won’t open, it’s been jammed”. 

“So, how do we get out of here” I said laughing. 

“We don’t, we’re stuck in here forever” he replied.

I looked at him, “yeah, definitely high”

I proceeded to walk away to look for Mansi when he grabbed my arm.

“Stop”

“What?” I said in an annoyed voice.

“My name is Tim”.

“Okay …?” I said.

“I’m from 2006.”

“What?”. 

“What year are you from?”

“Oh, I get it, you were class of 2006, but you look my age?”.

“No, I came to this party in 2006, and was never allowed to leave. You see, this party began in 1980, and since then people from various years came into this party. Some from 1981, 82, 83 … that guy right there (he said pointing to a guy wearing a white shirt) came in 2002.”

“He was the last one to come to this party before me, and until you, I was the latest member”.

I looked at Tim and rolled my eyes.

“Nice story Tim, you should write on No Sleep on Reddit”.

“What’s that” Tim said with a puzzled look on his face.

“Yeah, whatever man, I’m leaving”.

I began looking around for Mansi while Tim followed me.

“Time is a cruel thing” Tim said.

“We’re all victims of time”.

I tried ignoring Tim and kept searching for Mansi. Moving quickly through crowds of people, almost knocking a lady's drink out of her hand.

“Sorry” I said to her.

“She’s from 1999, notice her cellphone”. 

I saw a flip phone in the woman’s hand.

“So, what, plenty of people have those kinds of phones even today”. 

“You don’t believe me huh, alright, I’ll tell you what, check your watch, this party began at 5:00, at 5:35 it will reverse to 5:00 automatically, and you’ll realize you’re stuck”.

“Wow, so spooky man” I said in sarcastic tone.

Todd came up to Tim and said “what did I say about bothering the guests” in a stern tone.

I saw this as my opportunity to get rid of Tim, I made my escape and walked through several people.

The weird thing was, some of the people I stumbled into looked like people who I just passed a few minutes ago.

I started feeling a sense of doom. Eventually I saw an empty corner in the College.

I went there to calm myself down. Behind me was a window, covered with blinders. 

“Maybe someone is outside, I can knock on the window and they’ll notice me”. 

I opened the blinders of the window and to my shock I saw … nothing. Literally nothing, just pitch black. Not like it was night time, but more like a void, the absence of anything. The eternal oblivion. 

I noticed there was a second story to the College so I walked up the stairs, to see if there was something upstairs that could help me with this predicament.  

I tried to open the door to the second floor but it was jammed.

Push, pull, kick, nothing worked. (Yes, I kicked the door, partially out of frustration”).

I turned around and saw everyone down below, some dancing, others just standing and talking. I scanned the crowd to see if I could find Mansi, I finally saw her in a corner, her back turned to everyone. 

She was just standing there, alone, back turned to everyone.

I ran down the stairs and went up to her.

“Mansi, can we please leave, it’s really creepy here, and also, I don’t want to be late for the exam”.

Of course, the exam was merely an excuse at this point.

“Mansi … are you listening?”

Mansi stood there frozen, emotionless, then she looked upwards.

I looked up to see what she was looking at, and saw a banner which read “class of 1980”.

A chill went down my spine.

“No, no, no, no … this can’t be happening, it’s impossible”.

I looked at my watch, it was 5:33, although it felt like it had been much, much longer. In fact, it felt like I had been in the party forever.

I stared at my watch, as my arms trembled, which made it hard to look at it. Eventually, I took off my watch and put it down on the floor, and sat down on the floor and stared at it. It was now 5:34 … the second-hand kept ticking. 

I stared at the second-hand as it ticked, and ticked, from 1 to 2, to 3 all the way until it reached 11. 

Then when it was just about the reach the 12, I covered the watch with my hand. I was too scared to look. 

I’m not a religious guy, but I prayed the watch would read 5:35 … I took my hand off my watch to see the time, and the watch read …
