My name is Claire, this happened to me just over ten years ago now. If I’m going to tell this story, then I’m going to tell it right.

When I was in my early thirties, my husband passed away. He was driving home one night from a long day of work when a drunk driver hit his car. From what the coroner told me, he died on impact. And the state of his car was in shambles, the driver’s side was completely crumpled in. I was distraught with grief, and my then-six-year-old son, Tommy “Tom” didn’t understand what was happening. He kept asking where his daddy was and I had to tell him that daddy wasn’t coming back home. 

A year after my husband’s passing, we moved away. I couldn’t stay in that house anymore. We ended up selling it and moving to a small town just two states away in Indiana. I won’t say the name of the town, as I don’t want this to happen to anyone else. 
The house we moved into was a small, remote house that almost resembled a cabin. The interior walls were made up of dark wood paneling, and it reminded me of my grandparent’s house. That’s why I wanted to move there in the first place. Somewhere that felt familiar. The house had some distance from the neighbors, which I liked. Behind our home were thick woods that went on for miles, and I remember telling Tommy to never go into those woods unless I said it was okay. 

For the first year that we lived in that house, everything was normal. Although, Tommy was struggling to make friends at school. I can’t say that I blame him, he took his father’s death very rough and maybe that is why he would go on to disobey me in the next few years. I didn’t make friends any quicker than he did and most days I would find myself gardening to pass the time. That was something that I didn’t do before my husband died. I think it was a way for me to have some control over something, whether a plant lived or died depended on me. It calmed me and it made me happy to be able to do something good. 

I was in the backyard one afternoon while Tommy was at school. I was watering my lilies. It is important to note the layout of our backyard. Upon exiting the backdoor, you step out onto the patio which was layered with clay bricks on the ground. They were put in long ago and some were loose and would shake when I would step on them. Then almost against the wall of the house was where my flowers would be. I would often have my back facing away from the woods when I would water my plants. That specific afternoon, I was listening to music on my MP3 player as I tended to the flowers, and I thought I heard something. I thought I heard people talking. But not just people, but children. I pulled out my earbuds and listened closely. I could hear the murmurs of children whispering. I couldn’t make out what they were saying. I would try to write it out but it would just read like gibberish. And that’s what I thought it was, just gibberish. But it was children, there was no doubt about that. I turned around and faced the woods. 

“You kids should be in school!” I called out

the whispering stopped. 

There was nothing but the sound of a light breeze in the air. But the sudden silence of the children made my skin go cold. Usually, children liked to mess around and disobey adults, which is why it was so peculiar that they stopped talking about whatever it was that they were talking about. Nothing like that happened for a while, until a month later.


I was lying in bed one night, my window was cracked open because it was July and the summer heat made our house unbearably hot. I kept the screen of the window closed, as I didn’t want mosquitoes to infest our home. While I lay in bed, I thought I could hear something outside. It again, sounded like the whispers of children. But now, instead of there just being whispers, there was giggling too. The soft sound of children giggling. Something that I was very familiar with. But hearing that in the dead of night was chilling. It all happened so quickly. The next thing I heard was the sound of Tommy giggling from his bedroom. 

I sprang out of bed and ran to Tommy’s room, opening the bedroom door to see Tommy staring out of his bedroom window. His small body was illuminated by the moonlight. He giggled again at something that I didn’t see. 

“Thomas? What are you doing up?” I asked

Tommy turned to face me.

“The kids momma, the kids are here” he replied giggling.

I froze in place and goosebumps began to form on my bare arms. I ran to the window, looking out to see what Tommy was seeing. And I saw them too. Kids were walking into the woods behind our house. They must have been at Tommy’s window. I didn’t get a good look at the kids, but I could tell from the silhouettes of their bodies that they were children. Some are taller than others. 

“Tommy, honey… who were those kids?” I asked

“the kids from the grove Mommy” Tommy replied

“the grove? What’s the grove, honey?” I questioned

“it’s where they live.”

Tommy slept in my bed that night, I couldn’t sleep after that and stayed up to watch the windows, making sure those kids wouldn’t come back. 


Nothing happened for another two years. 

The next event that happened was similar to the first encounter that I had with the whispers. 

I was in the backyard gardening again. Tommy was at a friend’s house, it was a Friday and if I am being honest, I didn’t want to see him for the rest of the day. We had gotten into an argument that morning and he said some things to me that I’d rather not repeat. 

While I was gardening, I heard the snapping of twigs behind me, near the woods.

Snap

Crack

I turned, gasping as I did so. 

I came face to face with an older gentleman who threw his arms up as if he had been caught.

“W-who are you?” I asked

“My name is Allen, I’m your neighbor I guess” he replied

“you guess?” 

“I didn’t know that anyone lived here, I haven’t seen you at all.”

It didn’t make any sense, how could he not have known that we live here?

“You didn’t know? We’ve been living here for nearly three years” I exclaimed

He paused for a moment.

“Well, your house is surrounded by woods on all sides and I never usually pass by your house unless I have to” he tried to reason for why he was standing in my backyard. I looked at him for a moment. His face was worn with wrinkles from stress over the years and his eyes darted to his left toward the trees, as if he were paranoid.

“Why were you in the woods?” I asked unconsciously

“I decided to go on a walk this afternoon, I haven’t been in these old woods in a long time. Which reminds me” he stopped for a moment.

“Be careful in these woods, a lot of strange things in there.” 

He waved and walked back into the woods, back onto the trail. The entire scenario perplexed me, I didn’t understand what he meant and at the time, I hadn’t even thought of what had happened a few years prior. But after thinking about it, I now understood what Allen had meant. He wasn’t talking about animal noises or anything like that. He was talking about the children in the woods. 

Everything changed after Tommy turned nine. After school one day, we got into a heated argument about him not cleaning his room. Tommy was upset and packed a bag full of clothes and walked out of the back door and into the woods. He said that he was running away. I let him. Looking back now, it wasn’t the right decision. But I did the same thing at his age, and all he needed to do was go outside and let off some steam. But when he didn’t return by sundown, I knew something was wrong. Panicked, I grabbed a flashlight and ran into those old woods. 

I ran down the trail, calling for him and I weaved out of the way of overhanging tree branches. I was distraught and thought of the possibility of him being lost in the woods. I didn’t want to think about it. But the woods were thick and went on for miles, the thought of him out there gave me a fear that I didn’t know I had. I ran for what felt like hours.

As I was running through the woods, I kept hearing the familiar sound of children whispering, giggling, and laughing. I stopped and turned in circles again and again. But I couldn’t see anyone through the brush. But I could hear them cackling.

I continued to run down the path until my flashlight caught something just off of the trail, like a deer in headlights. It was nearly hidden out of view. It was Tommy’s shirt. He was wearing a black T-shirt with the Batman logo on it. But now it was in the leaves. I grabbed it and quickly examined it. The back of the shirt was torn, it had a big hole, almost appearing like there was no back to the shirt.

“Mom?” Tommy called out in the distance.

I dropped the shirt and ran quickly in the direction of his voice.

“Tommy!” I shouted, my voice echoed through the woods.

My flashlight caught him, shirtless, standing in the middle of the trail. He raised his hand over his eyes, and I lowered the flashlight, not wanting to blind him. 

“Tommy, are you okay? What happened?” I asked

“M-my s-shirt got c-caught” he struggled to speak. 

I guided him out of the woods and back into the house. Tommy didn’t speak for weeks after that night. I had to plead with him just to tell me goodnight. I had to send him to a psychiatrist, who eventually told me that Tommy may have suffered some trauma from being lost in the woods. 

It took Tommy seven months before he spoke again. 


Tommy turned seventeen, and things began to change with him. He didn’t hang out with any kids after school, and sometimes I would catch him in the backyard, just staring into the woods. I knew that what had happened to him was traumatic but I thought he overcame that memory. As the weeks passed on, I kept noticing Tommy’s strange behavior. Sometimes, I would catch him watching me from around the corner as I cooked dinner. When I would catch him, he wouldn’t be smiling or anything. He would just stare with a blank expression on his face. 

I didn’t understand the surfacing of the behavior. He was always very private before he turned seventeen. He would always be in his room. And maybe he wanted me to think that he was still doing that. Maybe he didn’t know that I could him several times, staring at me. 

One day, after school, he told me that he was going on a hike in the woods. I said that it was okay. And as I grabbed his backpack to bring it into his room, one of his notebooks fell out. I bent over to pick it up and when I did, it was open. In the notebook there were no notes from his classes, it was drawings. I didn’t understand them.

One of the drawings was of him standing in the woods, and next to him was a black tree and what I think was a face in the tree.

Then next page revealed another drawing of the tree digesting what looked like a woman. The tree had a wide mouth with wooden teeth that bit down on the lower torso of a person. It didn’t make any sense. Why would he draw something like that? Are these nightmares that he had after that night in the woods? Did he draw them when he woke up? 

I did not understand where this sudden change in behavior came from. Tommy had problems, that much I knew. He was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety when he was fourteen. But this was something entirely different.

Then, one night while I was laying in bed, attempting to fall asleep. I laid on my side, facing the doorway. The bedroom door was cracked and my bedroom window was cracked as well, letting in the cool air in the autumn night. 

I thought that I noticed something in the crack of my bedroom door, I squinted my eyes, attempting to get a clear view of what I was seeing. It was… Tommy. He was standing outside of my bedroom door, staring in. What horrified me more was what Tommy was wearing or what he wasn’t wearing. When he saw that I noticed the lack of clothing, he barged into the room. After that night, I knew that this person wasn’t my son.

I spent the next two days throwing up on and off all day. And I considered taking my own life after that. Leaving whoever that person was behind. 

But when I realized that I couldn’t do that, that I couldn’t just kill myself, I knew that I had to do something. And I confronted Tommy.

He had skipped school that day and went into the woods, he didn’t return for hours until he finally emerged. When he did, I asked him to come inside and sit down. I had a knife hidden up my sleeve, knowing that I was either going to get answers about where the real Tommy was or I would have to kill him.

He sat down on the sofa across from me as I sat in the loveseat. He smiled as I sat down, staring at my breasts. 

“Tommy, do you know what you did?” I asked

He smiled, “I showed you love” he replied

I wanted to vomit.

“No Tommy, that was not love. That was hate, that was… it was evil.”

“What do you mean, mother?” he asked

I paused for a moment, not wanting to remember that night.

“Tommy, you violated me.”

He didn’t speak, he just smiled as he watched me in my vulnerable state.

“My son would never do that to me.”

His smile faded.

“You are not my son.” I muttered and lunged at him with the knife.

Tommy was quick, he stuck out his feet, propelling me into the air and tossing me behind the sofa. I landed on my back, dropping the knife as it skid across the floor. I groaned and reached for my back. He had thrown me so hard that I thought that I broke my spine. 

“You stupid bitch” he let out in a gutteral tone, sounding like he wasn’t human.

He stood over me, his fists bawled. He crouched down, getting to my level.

“You had it coming, you stupid whore” 

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, he wrapped his hands around my neck, tensing his muscles so that my breath would slow.

“You know, you were right about one thing… I’m not your son.”

My face began to turn from a light red, to a dark purple.

“I’m surprised you didn’t figure it out sooner.”

A shot rang out. The other Tommy’s grip loosened as he collapsed to the ground, a black sludge gushed from the open hole in his forehead. I gasped for air, looking over to the front door to see my neighbor, Allen, standing there with his rifle.

“You okay?” he asked

I sat up, gripping my throat and catching my breath.

“Yeah, I’m okay” I replied. 

I glanced at the body, and was unsettled to see that it started to wither away, the skin began to shrink, turning a light grey, to a charcoal black. Until eventually, there was no skin at all, not even a skeleton, but instead there was what looked like dirt, and tree bark. 

“What the fuck was he?” I asked

Allen stood over the mound of dirt.

“I don’t know for sure, but he wasn’t human. He was a copycat”

“A copycat?” I asked

“The thing that lives in those woods, it makes them. It happened to my daughter, whatever it was, it ate her, and it spat out a copycat.” 

It’s been ten years since that day, I moved out shortly after. I reported my son as missing but I knew that he had been dead for years. Allen was there for me, he told me that he never told me about the thing in the woods because I wouldn’t believe him. But he did warn me. Now, I have to live, knowing that my son died years ago, alone, and scared. 

I’ve had my own theories over the years of what the truth may have been. The drawings that the copycat drew, it was of a person being eaten by a tree. That is what I believe makes the copycats. I don’t know what their purpose was, whether it was to cause chaos or if it was to make more of them. Either way, I have been in therapy for years for what happened. And even though he wasn’t my real son, he still had his face. So after having nightmares about him violating me, I went to therapy. I am doing much better now. Allen lost his wife before Tommy and I moved in, and we eventually started a relationship together. We decided that we didn’t want to get married or have children. But we’re happy most days, and we deal with the trauma together.
