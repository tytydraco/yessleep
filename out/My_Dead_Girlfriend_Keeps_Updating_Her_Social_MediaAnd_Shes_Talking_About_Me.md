It started with a notification. **Emily just posted a new photo.**

My stomach dropped. Emily died six months ago. 

I clicked on it with shaking hands. It was a picture of my apartment. My bedroom window, taken from the street. The caption: **"I see you."** I nearly dropped my phone. This had to be a sick joke. Someone must have hacked her account. I called her parents, but they hadn’t touched her profiles. Her phone had been buried with her.

I reported the account. Blocked it. But the posts kept coming. A week later, another picture. My car in the grocery store parking lot. **"You forgot the milk."** I couldn’t breathe. I had forgotten the milk. I tried logging into her account myself, but her password had been changed. I emailed customer support, desperate for answers. They responded a day later:

**"This account was accessed from a device last used six months ago."**

The last time I had seen her alive. I didn’t sleep that night. I locked my doors, closed my blinds, ignored my phone. But at 3:00 a.m., a notification lit up the screen.

**Emily just went live.**

I shouldn’t have clicked it. But I did. The screen was dark at first. Then, movement. A shaky, distorted view of something… underground. Wooden walls, soft earth pressing in at the edges. A low, rasping breath. Then, her voice. **"Let me out."**

I slammed the phone down. My whole body was shaking. The next morning, I drove to the cemetery. I don’t know what I was expecting—her grave was undisturbed, the dirt packed firm. But as I turned to leave, my phone buzzed again. One new photo. A picture of me. Standing at her grave.

Caption: **"Almost there."**

I didn’t go home. I checked into a motel. I needed time to think. But the messages didn’t stop. Every night at 3:00 a.m., another update. Sometimes pictures of places I had been that day. Other times, messages that made my skin crawl.

**"It’s cold down here."**

**"Why did you leave me?"**

**"He won’t let me out."**

I stopped reading them. I stopped sleeping. My friends told me to get help, but I knew this wasn’t just in my head. Someone—or something—was doing this. Then, last night, she posted a video. The camera shook violently, like someone was trying to break free. The screen was filled with darkness, but I could hear something scraping. Digging. Emily’s voice, panicked, desperate.

"Please," she sobbed. "I don’t want to be here anymore."

A sound behind her. A deep, rattling breath.

Then, a voice that didn’t belong to her. **"Almost time."** The stream cut off. I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to know the truth. I grabbed a shovel and drove back to the cemetery. The air was thick, pressing down on me like a weight. My hands trembled as I started digging. The deeper I went, the more I felt it—that wrongness, like something just beneath the surface was watching, waiting.

Then, my shovel hit wood.

The coffin was there. But something was wrong. The wood was splintered, cracked from the inside, like someone had been trying to claw their way out. My breath caught in my throat as I pried it open. It was empty. The phone in my pocket vibrated. I almost didn’t want to look. But I did.

**Live Now: Emily.**

The screen was pitch black, but I heard breathing. Slow, ragged. Then, a whisper was so close it felt like she was behind me.

**"He let me out."**

Something moved in the trees behind the grave.

And then the livestream ended.
