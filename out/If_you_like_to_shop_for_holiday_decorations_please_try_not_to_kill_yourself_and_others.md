All you Halloween shopper please take note, you need to be more careful or you are going to end up killing yourselves and others.

I and my associates are occasionally on here to look for leads, but right now I am here just at my wits end. Halloween is always the worst for my line of work and it is just a prelude to the most depressing part of my year, the holiday season. For the love of all that is normal and not FUBAR’ed take note.

My main day job is tastefully listed as "Aftermath services", most people call me a crime scene cleaner, but that is a misnomer as well. I am the person you call to clean up after crimes, sure, but I am also the person called after the police show up to perform a wellness check 2-3 months too late. Strangely enough I am also the person you call when someone "pranks" a party with Ipecac syrup, to do the cleanup. The location I work has, on the books, 4 employees working as the cleanup crew as well as management. Our LLC is owned by a several shell companies owned by individuals that have a vested interest in the location and destruction of cursed items.

Why such a crappy job? Well, For my line of work in the cursed item identification and removal business its actually perfect, The police have done the "heavy lifting" , no pun intended, usually documented everything in pictures for us. And we can request all that to "get an idea of the scope of the job". I see the police reports usually detailing any oddities I need to look into. Like small shrines covered in what the lab reports as "Ouchterlony test result: blood- Negative", so animal blood. If it comes back as human blood I'm not the guy that gets called. That is usually an unsolved mystery for the state. The Popo get to use all the state funded luminol and their labs are way faster than anything I can get for a reasonable price. When I have to do it myself in a rush it hits the business' bottom dollar and that means less of a bonus in April.

The event scene usually has to remain pristine if there is any foul play suspected, so that means an autopsy, which I can also get the results from! All under the guise of once again, "Knowing what to expect upon reaching the scene to perform the biohazard cleanup." By the time we get there anything "normal" is ruled out, and most of the time any bad juju is either dormant or latched on to any one of the hundreds of public servants who have been through the scene, so its safe for us to get in and do our work , Don't confuse this for us being clever or planning it this way , in truth its just the cheapest and most  efficient way to do it.

I'm writing too much but I am too tired and wired and scared out of my skull to not explain it all. All that above is the mechanics of a scene that we get called out on.  Even if it isn't an obvious cursed item I'm still possibly the one of many businesses called to clean up a mess that was caused by a curse. The bad part, well depressing, almost every post you have here, a guy like me and mine shows up afterwards paid by the family, or the bank to remove all the evidence that it ever happened so commerce can go on. Good part is that sometimes we get an inkling of what is going on and try to stop it from ever happening again. Final note on the job, I never have to break into a place, Im supposed to be there. And I have a reason to show up in hazmat gear...

The one job today that has me pulling my hair out is regarding the book rules ill cover tonight:

I get it! its Halloween and we like creepy things to decorate with and have our parties, those of you who haven’t already killed your family and friends accidently by being a moron that is. Get your decorations for these parties from Dollar tree, Dollar General, Walmart, the cheaper the better. No one curses items in a plastic mold injection plant, no demonic entity (or someone's soul ridden by one) would get past its ego enough to go into anything under a Target.

If you must be the original one on your block, the queen of the street. Sure go to those antique junk malls and consignment stores. It’s your ass. If you do shop at these places....Here are the rules on getting books.

Books to spooky up your living room..

1. If you cant even tell what language or what the letters are in the book, put it the hell down.
2. If you cant read the book, put it the hell down.
3. If you cant read all the stuff written in the margins put it the hell down.
4. If the grammar or spelling is off but you cant put your finger on how or why, put it the hell down.
5. If you cant read it at first but then it become legible almost "magically" and you can start to read parts, put it the hell down,
6. If you cant tell what artisanal material the cover or pages are made of, put it the hell down. Here's a hint, its probably made from someone just like you.
7. If the ink is an odd dark brown color…. Put it the hell down

So onto what's keeping me up tonight long after I should be trying to sleep. I and my cat are staring at a book. And my nerves and instincts are redlining.

The cat is planted in the hallway, staring at the book, the dog wont even come in the room or even the doorway where the book might "see" him, so I have an issue here.

The book was reacclimated from a clean up scene earlier today. Scary part is that this scene was not in any way listed as a criminal one, nor a number 6r, which is our in house slang for not of this world. It was a regular call out. The house as we pulled up was nice middle-middle upper single story That you see all over in this region. I love and hate working here in the south, love it because no basements, F that noise, cause I am all about mitigating personal risk, and basements are on my list of places I don't go. What I hate is that its fall and 100 degrees out still and now I have to get on respirator gear and a suit. Cause this one in this house is going to suck , I look at the SOW and see

"Carpet removal : biohazard - 800 square feet"

"Enzyme concrete treatment"

"concrete sealant - 800 square feet"

" 4 ozone fans 72 hours"

Translation: whatever happened here was not found early on and somebody or several somebodies' popped and all that soaked really deep into the carpet and all the way into the semi porous concrete slab for the house. So on a nice house like this sealed up and weather proofed to be energy efficient, with the lawn service paid for... they could have really stunk that place up a while and really marinated into the house before it was discovered.

I see the customer requesting the call out is a mortgage company in the area which, also tells me that everyone in this family was impacted. Any living family it would fall to them to schedule the clean up and they would be the customer, not the bank and title company. Nope this one there is no one to inherit the place and no estate waiting to be claimed so its just a bank repo to process it for sale now.

Once we get suited up and head in, well, its about what we expected. Ill spare you the visual carpet stain details. As for the smell you cant even imagine even, through my respirator and the menthol oil dabbed on a cotton swab in there, I was not enjoying my time as we started and completed all the work!

So I get home and that's when I realize I've got a code brown on my hands. First clue is Wesley doesn't greet me at the door. I want to say at that point I knew it, but I was just so hot and tired, and sometimes he's asleep and slow to get to come greet me. Its when I heard the whimper from around the corner I felt that sinking feeling as I realized I had a bad day, week, month, or however much time I had left coming at me . I immediately look around and see Buttercup, my cat, sitting there staring off into the living room from the kitchen over the half wall, This is about as bad as it gets. Big protective dog wont get near it, but the cat will look and see what's going on from a safe distance. Cats are like those people who slow everyone down at traffic accidents, as long as it isn't them they wanna see the death and destruction and savor it. This is bad. I mean I love buttercup, but its his nature to be an asshole.

Here's why I am super pissy and mad about this whole thing. Whoever lived at todays piecework was the jerk who wasn't following the common sense rules about books above and bought this damned cursed tome. I'm just the guy who moved it to a different bookcase, and just that little touch of moving one book among 20 on to another shelf was enough to trigger the curse transference to yours truly. In my defense in respirator gear and the suit it was a little foggy in there from all the sweat evap. so I had no idea I was breaking my rules, I had no idea this one was a code 6r!

So now I am just sitting here, terrified to tell the truth and just dumping everything down here on reddit trying to keep calm.

I see the book on my bookshelf wedged in between two of my cartoon collectors edition box sets. I mean it wants to be seen there, it is well and truly a sore thumb, between those pristine boxes. I only allow myself a quick glance at the spine, but yeah its rough looking.. the symbols or letters or whatever the hell is on it I wont look too close but they are not anything I have ever read or thought to see at my home.

I'm really scared y'all. I don't know how much time I have left before this cursed book does to me what it did to those other people. I don't know if ignoring it will piss it off, or make it less effective, or if it can even be pissed off! I don't know if I should go for a curse box for it, or if I should stay as far away from it physically as I can. Worst part is I have no idea how it got the people in the house as I didn't research this one before going in. I have no idea what when or how this things gonna come at me. Its the not knowing that gets me. All I know about the evil things in the world and how to delay or defeat them, and once it pops into my personal space I am overanalyzing it to death, and doing nothing worrying that doing anything making the situation worse.

I think all I can do is wait for that call with Risk management.
