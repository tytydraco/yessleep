Okay, a lot has happened within the past 48 hours, so bear with me. I don't know what to think about what has happened, just how awful it turned out. What had started as a simple investigation had quickly become a nightmarish scenario that will haunt me to the day I die, unable to not see the faces of the deceased and not feel guilt as the only two survivors of what the public is now calling the Amity disaster. But, I'm getting ahead of myself.

It was quiet that night after we had bolted everything down, save for the waves and imminent thunder on the horizon. It was pretty unlikely that anyone was going to get any sleep, and so we sat around and quietly talked, trying to take our minds off of what will inevitably happen. At some point, while the sun was starting it's way back into the sky, I was approached by Lawrence.

"You saved me back there, thank you," Lawrence said as he sat down next to me and Ellen, "I...I'm sorry for the way I've been acting towards you two. It's been years since I lived in the environment I grew up in, but old habits really do die hard. That being said, there should be no excuse for my behaviour."

"I appreciate you apologizing, just please don't stop trying to be a better person," Ellen replied, her words ringing out with sincerity, "People change people, and people do change, just don't give up on yourself."

I nodded in agreement with my wife, and we soon switched to other topics to talk about. We carried on, not knowing that this would be the last time I ever spoke with both of them. Unfortunately, however, it was only an hour later when the Amity was suddenly hit by an immense force that damaged the Amity's hull and sent the eleven of us scattering for cover. Shortly after, the object that hit us revealed itself to be Bruce's tail as it retracted out of the ship and rain began pouring inside.

"Shit, we've been breached!" Dylan called out, grabbing a harpoon, "All hands on deck, get to your battle stations!"

We all began to arm ourselves on our way to the deck of the ship ready to defend ourselves from the massive Dragon who was now looming overhead, his eyes filled with the same level of rage and contempt that I had seen the last time he was this close. The ship's guns were aimed directly at Bruce, ready to fire at a moment's notice. For a few moments, nobody moved after we got into position. Glancing around I can tell everyone was quite unnerved by this whole scenario. Sure, this crew had faced plenty of conflicts, from searching for rogue underwater mines to saving boats from wayward pirates. No one was truly prepared to come into contact with a Sea Dragon, since before this whole investigation began we didn't even know they existed. And none of us were prepared to fight one either, nevertheless we were willing to fight for the sake of ourselves and those back home. All to prevent Bruce from taking any more lives.

Little to no words were spoken throughout the ensuing fight against Bruce. Granted, it wasn't like there was much for any of us to say anyways, since the Dragon didn't seem like much of a talker. Rather, he let out a loud roar as he swung his massive tail at the Amity again. We were prepared this time, however, and started firing the guns at the beast in order to slow him down. While they did hit him, the ammunition didn't really do that much to stop the tail from smacking five crewmates off of the deck. They didn't get the chance to hit the water before they were snatched out of the air in rapid succession by the serpent's massive jaws.

He then turned his attention to the ship's guns with a look of rage as he prepared his next attack, but it was far from what we expected. Instead of hitting the ship with his tail a third time, we watched in horror as Bruce's gills and mouth began to glow bright blue before a massive jet of boiling hot water blasted from his jaws and swiped right across the deck. With each thing it passed by, the jet proceeded to carve through like a hot knife through butter, causing serious damage. As I was at one of the guns that were hit, I was nearly close to finding out the hard way what would happen if it connected with living tissue before I was pushed out of the way just in the nick of time.

Much to my horror, I heard a loud thud behind me as my rescuer collapsed, having not been as lucky to move away from the blast in time. I braced myself and opened my eyes, only to let out a shriek upon seeing Matt's decapitated body limp next to me. There wasn't even any blood, as if the blast had cauterized where his head had been burned off. I then saw movement out of the corner of my eye, and looked up to see Tia standing above me, her hand covering her mouth. She didn't say anything, but the horrified look of grief in her eyes was more than enough to suggest that she had just witnessed her fiance die right in front of her. There were tears in her eyes as she fell to her knees and let out a cry of anguish while holding Matt's corpse. I then watched as, through the howling winds and roars of thunder, the tears of anguish slowly morphed into snarls of rage before she slowly stood up, ran towards the edge of the Amity and dived straight into the chaotic water. A second had barely passed after she hit the water before the sounds of the hurricane were dwarfed by a beastly roar so loud that it caused everyone onboard to hold their ears in pain, before another Sea Dragon of similar size to Bruce rose out of the ocean.

I find it difficult to completely explain what happened next, for right after Tia rose back out of the water she immediately turned her attention towards Bruce and everything descended into chaos.If it wasn't bad enough to be attacked by a giant monster in the middle of a storm in the middle of the ocean, the Amity had now found itself caught in the middle of a fight between two mythical beasts. Having worked in my career as long as I have, I've been caught in the middle of fights between marine life before. I've seen hammerheads fighting a pack of dolphins, witnessed a whale fighting off a giant squid. All of those scenarios made me feel relatively small, but in comparison to the two Dragons battling it out in the hurricane, the crew of the Amity might as well have been ants. Our attacks on Bruce had already proven practically useless, and now the most we could do is take cover and hope to not get caught in the crossfire.

Needless to say, that was easier said than done, and those 48 hours were filled with several casualties. Tragically, my wife and her uncle were eventually counted among the dead by the time everything was over. Ellen was struck in the head by a life boat knocked loose by another slap on the ship by Bruce's tail, snapping her neck and killing her instantly. Dylan wasn't so lucky (if I can even call it that), for another blast of boiling water had left his bisected corpse falling into the water. Death after death, life taken after life taken. I knew every single person on that ship, with some even having a personal connection with. Before this investigation had began, I could recognize all of their faces. Now, as I'm typing this, their faces are all I can see, along with images in my mind of their dead bodies.

At some point, I can't remember when, another hit to the boat had tore open the hull on the bottom, causing the Amity to slowly start to sink. What I didn't notice, however, but Lawrence had noticed, is that the same hit had opened up the chamber where the Amity was keeping its torpedoes. They were on board and rarely used, with Dylan having previously told me that they were only to be used if another ship were to attack us.

"How powerful are these?" I just barely heard him ask over the roaring of the two Dragons and the now dying down thunder as the hurricane passed us over.

I looked him dead in the eyes, catching on to what he was thinking as I replied, "Just one is enough to sink a battleship."

With a nod to each other, we swiftly ran to the chamber and together picked up one a torpedo and went to load it, only to find ourselves with a problem. In the midst of the fighting, one of the water blasts had melted the metal on the launcher, effectively welding it shut.

I began to get a sinking feeling as a dark look formed in the representative's eyes as he said, "Whatever happens next, get to the turret and shoot the torpedo once he's got it in his teeth."

"Larry, don't you dare-"

"Just fucking do it! Don't worry about me!" He cut off my protest, before he dragged the torpedo out of the gun chamber on his own and managed to get on deck with it and used some nearby rope to tie it to himself.

Before I could say anything else, Lawrence began shouting and waving his arms to get Bruce's attention. At this point Tia wasn't in sight, and I had no idea if she was alive or not in that very moment. With her not fighting him, however, that gave the beast time to turn his attention to us. The Sea Dragon was staring at Lawrence running around on the deck of the sinking ship, reminding me of a snake staring down a mouse about to become its next meal. It didn't take long for the serpentine sea monster to slowly pull back and coil into himself before his massive head launched forward, and the last time I saw Lawrence alive was him giving me a thumbs up seconds before he disappeared completely behind the rows of enormous teeth.

I wanted to scream, cry, or throw up, or some mix of all three. Before this investigation had begun there were fifteen people on the Amity, and over the course of this endeavour I had witnessed the deaths of every single person I had either known personally or had even also grown up with. And now, with Tia's fate unknown to me at that moment, I had just witnessed Lawrence - who for the longest time I had considered a jerk but over the course of this trip proved that he was wanting to and willing to try to be a better person - intentionally sacrifice himself in order to give me a chance to kill the monster responsible for his death and that of everyone else.

But I couldn't do that, I couldn't give up now. Not when I could see the torpedo was lodged in Bruce's mouth. Knowing what I had to do, I booked it back to where the firearms were kept and grabbed a rifle, having to push through gushing sea water as I did. Thankfully the gun was dry and didn't suffer any water damage, but I didn't have time to worry about that as I booked it back on deck just to see Bruce lunging towards me, jaw open wide. Just then, Tia lunged back out of the water and latched onto the other Sea Dragon by the nape of his neck, yanking him back into the water to continue the fight.

*Don't you dare hesitate, I'll keep him in place!* I heard Tia's voice in my head as out loud she snarled.

Snapping out of my fear, I waded through the water as swiftly as possible and began climbing up to the crow's nest. As soon as I reached the nest I held on tight to the guard rail and loaded a bullet into the rifle. Lifting it up to my shoulder and looking down the scope, I found myself constantly adjusting my aim in order to keep up with the battle. With Tia and Bruce constantly thrashing around in the water, locking onto the spot on the torpedo where I knew its trigger would be was proving to be quite difficult much to my frustration. It was right there in his teeth but with their fight he kept opening and closing his mouth.

"Oh fuck's sake smile you son of a-" I exclaimed and, acting quickly the second I had a long enough opening, put the torpedo' dead in my sights and pulled the trigger.

For a moment, there was silence, leaving me unsure about whether or not I'd hit the torpedo at all. Then came a flash of fire and light followed by the sound of a large explosion. I ended up covering my eyes so as to shield them from debris, and when I looked back there were massive chunks of flesh floating in the water where Bruce had been moments ago. Finally, after days of being hunted by the Sea Dragon and nearly being eaten by him twice, he was finally dead.

That didn't mean our troubles were over, however. There I was, floating in the open water surrounded by the bodies of close friends and family along with what was left of the beast. Tia checked on me a few times to make sure I was still alive, but it was a while before I was rested just enough to reply with noise instead of just my eyes. I have no idea how long we floated there, or at what point Tia decided to shift into her human form and pull me onto an inflatable raft. Oddly enough, by this point I felt completely rejuvenated. Even as the sun rose and set twice before other Canadian Coast Guard ships arrived to rescue any survivors, I didn't feel tired, or hungry or thirsty at all. If anything, I was both relieved that it was finally over, and mourning for the people who were lost in our fight against Bruce, with my wife and uncle-in-law among the deceased.

In fact, I didn't even notice the fact that something still wasn't quite right until we finally reached the shores of Halifax and climbed back onto dry land. I looked down with surprise upon realizing that my leg, which had been broken 48 hours prior, was now perfectly healed like nothing had happened. Even as someone like myself who's a little different, broken bones usually take 3-6 months to heal, not two days. Tia and I exchanged glances and shrugged, unsure of what to make of it. I didn't find a possible answer until my conversation with my family doctor, who looked me over a day later.

"How odd indeed," the doctor said as he glanced over his notes, "Psychologically you're a mess, and yet physically you're in good health. Even with your unique physiology, the injuries you'd described as getting realistically should still be here. There is something we did find, however."

Hesitantly, I asked, "What did you find?"

The doctor held up a bag containing what looked like a bloodied scale as he replied, "This is what we pulled out of your arm. We were able to identify your blood on it, but there's another source of what appears to be blood on it that matches what was found on the remains of the entity you killed. This same substance has also been found in your bloodstream. Whatever that beast was, we think that's what caused your body to recover so quickly."

"...Is it possible to remove it?"

"Afraid not," he solemnly stated, "Usually with blood transfusions there's a risk of your body rejecting the donated blood, but you're not showing any signs of that. Plus the blood has already had plenty of time to integrate into your own, so I don't think it's going anywhere. I wish it made sense as much as you probably do, but that's the situation."

So now I'm back at home typing this out, completely unsure of how to feel about everything. I've been trying to get sleep but I keep seeing their faces whenever I close my eyes. With Ellen gone, our bed feels cold. I'm thankful that after the investigation and the funeral I was able to keep a pair of urns filled with her ashes and Dylan''s. Now they sit on my coffee table, a reminder of those that were lost but won't be forgotten. When this investigation started, I had questions about the man eater we were hunting in order to stop the attacks. Now, that monster's blood runs through my veins and almost everyone I know personally is gone, leaving me with so much trauma to process and more questions than answers.
