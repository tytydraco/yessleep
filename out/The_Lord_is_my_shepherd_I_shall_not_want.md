I was driving home late one night after a long shift, the kind that left me drained to my very core. The road stretched ahead of me, empty and quiet, an endless ribbon of asphalt swallowed by the thick darkness surrounding it. My headlights barely cut through the heavy fog, casting eerie shadows that danced and flickered like restless spirits. All I wanted was to get home, crawl into bed, and forget how exhausted I was.

The car's tires roared steadily against the pavement, a monotonous sound that should’ve been soothing. Instead, it only amplified the unease slowly creeping into my chest. I’d taken this route countless times, but something about tonight felt different. The air felt colder. I shook my head, blaming the fatigue.

Then it happened.

A chill ran down my spine, sharp and unnatural, making the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Instinctively, I slowed the car. My eyes strained against the fog, and that’s when I saw her—a figure at the edge of the road. My heart jumped into my throat.

She stood still, pale as moonlight, barely distinguishable from the fog. I couldn’t make out her features, but she looked like a woman, her long, tangled hair fluttering in the wind. It didn’t make sense—there was no wind.

Something about her posture, the way she seemed to float inches above the ground, froze me in place. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as an overwhelming urge to drive away gripped me. Yet I sat there, staring, unable to move. She didn’t wave, didn’t call for help. She simply stood there, staring into the darkness as though I didn’t exist.

A voice inside me screamed to keep driving, to leave her behind and not look back. But my body refused to obey. My pulse pounded in my ears as a cold sweat broke out across my forehead. I don’t know how long I sat there, but I suddenly found myself whispering the only thing that came to mind—a prayer my late grandmother had taught me when I was a child:

“The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.”

The words tumbled out of my mouth, shaky at first but growing stronger with each repetition. I wasn’t even sure I believed in such things anymore, but at that moment, it was all I had. The prayer steadied me, gave me the courage to press my foot down on the gas and move forward. My car inched past her, and I resisted the primal urge to look at her face. I couldn’t shake the feeling that if I did, something terrible would happen.

As I drove on, the figure faded into the shadows, swallowed by the fog. I kept whispering the prayer under my breath, clinging to it like a lifeline. I didn’t dare glance in the rearview mirror, terrified of what I might see. Every horror movie I’d ever watched played out in my mind, and I cursed myself for ever enjoying them.

“The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want,” I repeated again and again. The rhythmic repetition helped calm my nerves as I focused on the road ahead. The drive home felt like an eternity, each mile stretching longer than the last. The darkness outside seemed to press against the car windows, suffocating and oppressive.

Finally, I saw the familiar glow of my porch light in the distance. Relief washed over me like a wave, and I pulled into the driveway so quickly I nearly hit the fence. Shaking, I turned off the engine and grabbed my bag, practically leaping out of the car. The cold night air hit me, but I barely noticed. All I could think about was getting inside, locking the door, and putting this nightmare behind me.

My hands fumbled with the keys as I reached the front door. They trembled so badly that I dropped them once, then twice. I cursed under my breath, still whispering the prayer as if it would somehow shield me. The words had become a mantra, an anchor in a sea of panic.

When I finally got the door open, I stumbled inside and slammed it shut behind me. The faint glow from the streetlamp outside spilled into the hallway, offering just enough light to navigate. I didn’t bother turning on the living room lights; I just needed to get to my bedroom and feel the safety of my walls around me.

But as I reached for the light switch near the door, something stopped me.

I don’t know what it was—an instinct, a presence, a sense of being watched—but I froze. My breath caught in my throat as I turned my head ever so slightly. 

That’s when I saw her. Again.

She was standing in the darkness, just a few feet away from me. Her wet hair hung in long, stringy strands, clinging to her face. Her eyes—wide, unblinking—locked onto mine with a look that sent ice through my veins. And her mouth…her mouth was twisted into a grotesque grin, stretching unnaturally across her face.

I couldn’t move. My legs felt like jelly, my body paralysed by fear. Smiling, she tilted her head to one side, then the other, a slow, deliberate motion that seemed almost playful. The grin on her face grew wider, impossibly wide.

And then, to my horror, she spoke in a sing-song tone:

“THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD, I SHALL NOT WANT,” she said, her voice a chilling mockery of my prayer.

My knees buckled, and I stumbled back against the door. She took a step closer, her bare feet soundless against the floor. 

“THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD, I SHALL NOT WANT. THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD, I SHALL NOT WANT.”

Each repetition was ended with an eardrum-piercing laughter. Louder, more distorted, as though her voice was coming from everywhere and nowhere all at once. My heart hammered in my chest as I fumbled for the light switch, desperate to banish the darkness.

I flipped the switch, flooding the room with light—and she was gone.

I sank to the floor, trembling, unable to process what had just happened. The prayer still lingered on my lips, but the words felt hollow now, meaningless. I sat there for what felt like hours, waiting for something—anything—to happen.

But nothing did.

Eventually, I forced myself to stand, locking every door and window in the house before retreating to my bedroom. I left the lights on, unwilling to face the darkness again. 

Even now, as I have finished this story, I am too afraid to go to sleep.
