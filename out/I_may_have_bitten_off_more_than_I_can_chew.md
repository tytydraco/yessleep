Alright, so I’m going to explain the situation I’ve been in for the past few days, because this is getting a bit scary for me, and I need help.

So I’m a witch, back at my home I have a few Coven mates that practice with me (we’re all young 17-20 years old, and relatively new to witchcraft as a whole). Anyway we’d meet up in the woods to contact spirits, goof around with magic circles, or read palms and tarot cards etc. it was always very fun, and while we did have some harrowing encounters, it was never anything we couldn’t control. The worst thing we ever dealt with was a somewhat malicious presence that permenately took residence in one of our bathrooms after we botched a séance there.

Anyway, before college, I decided to go on a gap year to a folk school in Norway, (I’m from the United States) and I had to leave my coven. It’s been difficult finding people who have similar interests in the occult as my  own, so I’ve been unable to form a coven here, but because Halloween is coming soon I decided that I was going to try to get people involved in a Séance, as everyone is in the mood for spooky season.This leads us to 5 days ago, when I set out to find a good spot to hold such a Séance. 
There’s a hiking trail by the school, and along the road there is a plaque that marks the spot of a village that exist on the banks of the lake 4000 years ago, there’s nothing left of the structures, but apparently archeological digs have found bone fish hooks and other artifacts there. Anyway I thought this was the perfect spot to hold a séance with my friends, and I went alone to check it out beforehand. I used my staff to draw a quick protection circle in the dirt before kneeling and meditating, normally i get a slight chill down my spine or the wind changes slightly, but for the first five minutes it was practically dead silent… that’s when I first felt the presence. The best way I could describe the feeling is walking through the woods at night with a flashlight,turning a corner, and seeing the flashlight beam illuminate the eyes of a wolf. Something was there and I now had it’s full attention. I just ran, and I can swear the wind started blowing ten times harder as I did so, but once I made it back to school I could no longer feel it’s presence, that is until nightfall.

I was in my room reading my tarot cards, and I decided to ask what that thing was, I placed down my cards, and revealed the reversed queen of coins, the moon, and the devil. And just like that, I felt it watching me. The feeling would not go away and I was too afraid to turn off the lights. I just hid under the covers until I fell asleep. For the next two nights the same feeling returned but nothing happened other than the eerie feeling. It was last night ago when the thing started actually making moves, I heard scuttling outside my dorm door and this haunting whistle that has essentially been playing on repeat in my brain. I once again hid under my blankets and waited for it to stop. Today I’ve noticed that doors that aren’t clicked into place just open and close slightly when I am near them, and while I don’t have its full attention, I can feel something watching me. I’m currently casting every protective charm I know, but this is much different than what I have dealt with before, and without my coven, I am unsure what to do… Halloween is coming and  I don’t know how I’m supposed to manage a presence like this as the barrier thins.
