I have a problem, a rather chilling one if not. There are beings that come and watch me at the same time every night.

This all started happening about 2 months ago and has happened every single day since then. I don't recall ever seeing the watchers before hand or ever really.

You might be wondering: "What the hell is a watcher?" Allow me to give a brief description of these cursed beings that visit my room every night. They're black figures with piercing red eyes that feel hot when they stare at you. And their aura... It's almost sickening and so frightening that it paralyzes the body and messes up the heart's beating pattern. They donâ€™t talk and their silence is what drives me mad and makes me want to scream. But that's not even the worst part.

The closer they get, the harder it gets to breathe.

I've looked all over the internet for answers of just *what* could be making these creatures haunt me at night. One website said that they were my so-called "guardian angels". Yeah right.

I know what you're thinking, that I'm simply experiencing sleep paralysis or that I'm just having night terrors.

Heh, as far as night terrors go, these watchers are definitely the description of something that brings terror into one's life.

Of all the questions I think about when it comes to this lovely curse I've been dealt with, the biggest one is *why* haven't they taken me yet? Call me gullible but a website said that cursed apparitions like these take their victims within the 5th week of haunting them. Yet it's going on 3 months now and I am still here. Not that I want to be taken of course but it still lingers in my mind, this question.

I don't know where they come from or what they want from me. The only thing I do know is that they certainly aren't friendly, at least I don't think so.

I know they're real because one of them touched me once. A touch that burned in my skin and spread throughout my body when it laid a wispy black shadow on my cheek. The pain lingered there as it looked into my eyes and so I looked back into it's red, glowing ones. And then the time changed to 12 am and all 3 of them vanished into thin air, one by one.

The numbers of these entities change every night. Sometimes it's 2, other times it's 5, and a few times it's been a whole room full. No matter where I am they never fail to show up at 11:59 pm. Never.

I don't think there is any way out of this and if there is it certainly isn't making itself known.

It's almost time... I don't know what to do. Maybe tonight's the night they'll take me, I'm left wondering in fear.

All I know is that if you see figures in your room at night, then be weary.

They aren't your friends.
