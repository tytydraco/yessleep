Home alone

Part one is here

I left for work on Monday.  I have to admit,  it felt good leaving home. The sleepless night hit me hard, I was in shambles and couldn't even think about being productive. At the  time I worked as gas station operator and my colleague was a young man who kept talking about his former work,  where he used to install surveillance cameras.
After chatting with him I decided to get a few ip cameras with motion sensor and place them in my room,  kitchen and hallway. 

When I returned home this evening I checked out my flat, everything was dirty again. I mentally mapped out where I would place the cameras and decided to heat up some leftovers. As I opened the fridge my sense of smell was assaulted by a strong unpleasant odour- something was rotting. I had to throw out several foods that had gone bad: milk, cheese and a joghurt my daughter didn't eat.
After eating the food that didn't go bad I decided to unpack the cameras and look at the video tutorials for setting them up. But that didn't work out, either my PC would crash or the Internet would go down. I decided to invite the colleague over tomorrow, he would probably do a better job at it than me anyway. 

I turned the lights on and locked the door before lying down on my bed and falling asleep. I had the weirdest dream that night: I had very intense tooth ache and as I went to the bathroom to check them out I saw that they had turned black and yellow in colour,  with roots protruding from my gums. I was in shock,  grabbed my toothbrush and started cleaning them furiously. As I spat out the toothpaste, I noticed that it had a reddish colour and it's structure reminded me or f spoiled milk. I panicked and continued to brush them, repeating the same motions over and over. The nightmare couldn't have lasted long but during this time I couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was with me in the room, someone who gleefully watched me, enjoying my suffering. 

The blaring of my alarm pulled me out of this nightmare.  Having looked at the time I noticed I was running late for work, so I threw on some clothes and hastily left the house, starting a new day of feeling unwell and tired, as if I didn't sleep at all. My thoughts kept circling back to the strange dream, I read somewhere that dreams about teeth prophesied an oncoming illness. 

The day seemed to stretch on endlessly and I kept feeling worse. I asked for a sick day off, thinking I could just sleep it off and maybe even get some chores done. I decided to go home with my colleague Evan.  It took quite some persuasion on my part but he agreed to help me with the cameras.  He didn't appear to take any of it seriously though,  it seemed.

As we entered my flat Evan cracked a joke that it feels colder in my home than outside. l of course replied with that  it is always cold and damp in my crypt. But I did wonder what it meant. 

After he set up the cameras Evan went to the bathroom to clean his hands and after a few moments I heard him call to me. He sounded scared. I sluggishly walked over to him and immediately noticed the sink being covered in pinkish stains and smears that looked slightly like blood. I felt lightheaded and drowsy,  but I managed to lie to my colleague that my daughter did some painting and I just didn't get around to cleaning up yet. I told him to wash his hands in the kitchen and sent him off shortly after. 

The second after we said our goodbyes and the door closed behind him I rushed into the bathroom, staring at my mouth and teeth in the mirror. Perhaps it wasn't a dream? Was I turning into a weirdo that does strange things at night? I sat there for a long time,  staring at the wall. I began to slowly make my peace that I was going insane after my divorce,  that maybe if I started drinking again nothing like this would be happening. 

Later I remembered that my ex wife believed in that nonsense about curses and all the like. But why would those things happen to after the divorce? I had trouble thinking straight  but was hellbent on finding out what was happening,  now that I had cameras. 

I didn't even eat supper this day,  just lying on the bed with the TV on, slowly slipping away. It felt unreal,  my brain refused to believe it was happening to me. 

The door to my room was locked as always, the lights in the hallway and in my room were on. Lost in thought I stared at the door and noticed a shadow in the gap between door and the floor that immediately drifted to the side. As if it was watching me through the door. I felt terrified, more than ever. You may laugh at a grown man being horrified to get up from his bed but I know for sure , if not today then tomorrow I will look at the recordings and find out what is going on. 
I don't remember falling asleep but I slept well this night,  no weird dreams at all. I decided to have a lazy day, seeing I didn't have to go out. First thing I did was turn on the PC, to find out what scared me last night. Watching the footage I didn't see anything strange,  nothing at all. The first thought that cainto my balding head was - well, you ve finally gone crazy. I decided to wait a bit  however,  before going to a shrink. I cleaned up my flat and went shopping afterwards. 

As I came home,  I met my neighbour, Leon. He was the most well-informed person I knew, a former policeman and now our facilities manager, who has lived in the house for the longest time,  knew all tenants and loved to chat. So I decided to ask him whether someone has died in my flat or anything  strange happened in our house. But because Leo loves to chat he took up half an hour of my time before gracing me with the information that no one ever died in our home. So that led me to the conclusion that there are no ghosts involved..on the other hand,  why has nothing like that happened before?

When I returned home  I started cooking dinner and decided to call my sister. I invited her over to my place with her husband over the weekend.  She accepted.  She probably saw how unwell I looked and I couldn't even think of getting my daughter for the weekend,  with those strange occurrences.

After having dinner i decided to scour the Internet, perhaps this happened to someone before? But I didn't find anything except for talks about curses and out-of -body experiences and I don't believe in that. With those thoughts,  I fell asleep again. 

I dreamt of my mother this night. She has died years ago. I do not remember what we talked about but I didn't have any negative feelings. 

I barely managed to wake up this morning and I didn't feel well, which has become the norm lately. I had a shitty mood throughout the entire workday. After just doing the mandatory things I went with Evan to a birthday party. We talked mainly about switching jobs, maybe getting a better position in the process, moving to a different city. I stayed there overnight,  I didn't want to leave my car in the middle of nowhere. 

A new day at work that I only got through because of my anticipation for returning home and looking through new camera footage. I was sure I would discover something new. As I returned home this evening my sister was already there, waiting for me with her husband. I didn't see them in a while and my mood got better,  I didn't want to think of negativity in my life.

As we entered the flat, everything was messy again. I decided to ignore it and brought my guests to their room.  While my sister was making supper I decided to check the footage. I saw papers flying across the room. The window was open though, so I don't think tgat is something paranormal. It probably was all in my head.

We spent the evening like a real family.  We wanted to visit an aunt in the village the next day. I never really liked her but it was a tradition since our childhood.  

We went to sleep in separate rooms. I didn't sleep well at all. The next morning my sister asked to talk to me in private.
" Listen.  I barely slept this night. I had this bad feeling and then you just made it worse.  You stood in the doorframe,  staring at me. Your lips were moving,  as if you wanted to say something. I woke my husband but you just stepped to the side and were gone. What was that all about?"

I didn't know what to say. The only idea I had was to check the camera footage. We looked through them several times and we saw nothing.  Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. 

Except that it recorded my sister the entire night. And she was asleep all the time,  no waking up,  not waking her husband,  nothing. 

We decided to keep quiet and just go visit our aunt. The drive was quiet,  the mood gloomy. Only her husband tried to strike a conversation all the time but gave up after a while. " Silence must run in your family " he said.
