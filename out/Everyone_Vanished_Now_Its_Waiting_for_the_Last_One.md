Everyone on my street is gone.

Not just “went on vacation” gone. Not “moved out in the middle of the night” gone. I mean *gone.* Houses left wide open, food rotting on kitchen counters, cars sitting untouched in driveways.

At first, it was subtle. A neighbor didn’t return from work. A few more didn’t show up the next day. Dogs stopped barking. No kids screaming, no lawnmowers, no conversations drifting over the fences. Then the lights in their houses started going out, one by one.

It’s been three days now. Three days without a single sign of life outside.

But here’s the thing.

It’s also been three days without *daylight.*

The sun never came up. Not once. I don’t know how that’s even possible. The sky hasn’t changed—just this endless, heavy black. The streetlights flicker like they’re running on backup generators. There’s no wind. No stars. Just darkness pressing down from above.

And the silence… the silence is *wrong.*

It’s not peaceful or quiet. It *presses* against you, like it’s listening.

I’ve stayed inside, obviously. I’ve kept the doors locked, curtains drawn. I haven’t dared step outside, not since I saw what was out there.

It was around what should’ve been 8 PM, on the second day. I was staring out the window, half-hoping I’d see someone. Anyone.

That’s when I noticed the figure.

Standing perfectly still under the streetlight.

Not walking. Not swaying. Just *there.*

At first, I felt a weird kind of relief. Finally, someone else. I almost opened the window to yell something.

But then I really looked at it.

The figure’s arms were stiff at its sides. Its head was tilted, just slightly, like it was listening for something... or trying to decide something. And the way it stood—it wasn’t natural. No shift in weight, no breath, no human hesitation.

Like a mannequin that was thinking.

I couldn’t stop watching it.

And it never moved.

Eventually, I backed away. Every instinct I had was screaming to get out of sight. I turned off all the lights, locked every door, every window. My hands were shaking so badly I almost forgot how locks worked. I closed the curtains and sat in the dark, trying to convince myself I was imagining things.

But when I checked again...

The figure was still there.

Same spot.

Still not moving.

Like it was *waiting.*

I tried to distract myself. Played music. Paced. Ate something cold from the fridge. But nothing helped. The silence kept creeping in. Thick. Heavy. Like the air had weight to it. Like it wanted inside.

That’s when I heard it.

**Tap. Tap. Tap.**

From the window behind me.

My stomach dropped.

I turned around slowly. The curtain swayed just slightly, like it had been brushed by something. I didn’t want to look. I *knew* what I’d see.

The one window I forgot to lock.

I lunged forward, slammed it shut, clicked the latch into place. My breath fogged up the glass.

I peeked through it once.

The figure was gone.

Just vanished.

But the street outside... it felt *emptier* somehow. Like something had crossed a line it wasn’t supposed to.

I started walking the house, double-checking the locks. The lights kept flickering above me, and the floor creaked under my steps.

Then I stopped.

And the floor creaked *again.*

I didn’t move.

But something else did.

I spun around, expecting to see... I don’t even know what. Nothing was there. Just the hallway behind me.

Empty.

But I could feel it. The presence. Close. Watching.

I whispered to myself, trying to laugh it off. “I’m going fucking insane.”

And then something laughed *back.*

Not loud. Not in my ears.

But *under* the house. *Inside* the walls. Like the structure itself exhaled with amusement.

That was hours ago. I think. The clocks don’t work anymore.

I’ve been sitting in the dark, waiting. Listening. The figure hasn’t returned.

But I don’t think I scared it off.

I think it’s already inside.

Something’s been moving behind the walls. I hear it breathing when I stop. I feel it standing behind me when I blink. The shadows in the corners twitch if I stare at them too long.

And just now, as I write this, I swear I saw something on my phone screen. Not a reflection. A *face.* Not mine.

It smiled.

I’m not sure how much longer I’ll be able to stay awake. Or sane.

If this gets posted—somehow—don’t come looking for me.

If the sun doesn’t rise tomorrow where you are... *don’t go outside.*

And if you hear tapping at your window—

Don’t check it.

Don’t move.

Don’t breathe.

Because it’s not looking for someone.

It’s waiting for the *last* one.
