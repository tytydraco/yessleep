I work at The Drowsy Spectre, a caf√© positioned in a place sure to never get any business. No human business, that is. I made a chai latte for a chatty skinwalker, and one time a sort of spider... lady... thing tried to get me to marry her. I politely declined and Selene (aided by Barrow) had to remove her from the establishment. In short, a lot of weird stuff happens. I've only been there a week, or two if you count all my lost days. If that doesn't make sense to you, then go ahead and check[ this](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/z473tt/i_am_a_barista_that_serves_the_supernatural_find/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) out.

\--------------------------------------

We're open again, yay! Richard is looking for someone to fill Jonathan's role, but for now he is giving John and I overtime to be the 'humans on shift.' I have nothing better to do, so I won't complain about extra money.

I am on break and realized that the updates I give don't really give you an image of my actual shift. Sure, you hear plenty about Tall Ben (no, I have not given him his meat despite mixed advice from y'all) and Bilgoth. There are plenty of things worth writing about during every day shifts, especially during the five days we all went missing. That's another thing; Richard is pushing back against paying us for those days. Who am I supposed to complain to, and what would I say? "Hey, I was in a pocket dimension where time moves differently. Am I owed pay for that?" No one in their right mind would listen.

Anyway, just an hour ago, I was minding my own business at the front counter. It'd been a slow day so far, the store was actually empty save for one customer in a dark corner. They didn't order anything, just watched. I really couldn't bring myself to care, to be honest. Then, in through the front door comes a massive fly. I mean, Dwayne Johnson if his legs and arms were sticks. This bug's core and chest belonged to a body builder. It had a person's face, too, but with an elongated nose and mouth. Yeah, I did not and *still* don't like that thing. As customers go, however, it was quite tame. It walked up on legs that were far too thin to support its hulking body and inspected our seasonal special list that sat next to the front register.

"Wh kun ilk ou ave?"

Was that supposed to be english? "I'm sorry, would you mind repeating that for me?"

"Ilk. Anthin aj?"

I looked over at Em, who was cleaning our bakery case. Breaking character, I leaned towards her. "Can you understand this guy?"

She handed over some ticket papers and I understood. I gave a sharpie and the paper to the fly, which seemed to please it greatly. It scribbled for a moment, then handed the paper back to me. I read it out loud, just in case.

"Do we have aged milk?" It nodded. Barrow was on bar. "Aged milk?"

For a split second, Barrow grimaced, but he quickly adopted a mask. "Certainly, we have curdled whole milk and almond milk."

It took back the paper to write down its order. A peppermint mocha latte, hot, with curdled whole milk. And, if we had any, some spoiled meat. I knew about our store of rotten food in the very back of the store, but I was not aware of our alternative milk options that Barrow pulled out of a pantry to his right. It wasn't refrigerated, which I guess made sense if one is trying to spoil something. The espresso machine had two wands for frothing, but we used both for normal drinks. I had to repress a gag when Barrow used those *same* wands for the fly's drink! I wouldn't be getting any more hot drinks in the future, that was for certain.

John came up with a plate of assorted brown meat that was turning black at the edges. The fly, whose face was human, smiled from its eyes and nodded thanks to John. Then, it came back over near the register to wait for its drink.

The bell at the door sounded, welcoming a small lizard. I swear, it was the GEICO gecko. Walked on their hind legs and everything, identical to the one in the commercials. They walked right up to the counter and must have caught me staring because I got a hot glare (look, in the moment I suspended disbelief after everything I'd seen and considered the possibility that the GEICO gecko was real). It lifted its green head, realized just how far from the register they were, and made a move to climb up to meet me. The gecko was short and didn't even come close to my knee. Therefore, the inconvenience of the situation was clear to the fly. It kindly leaned down, lifted the gecko, and placed it on the counter in front of me.

"Thank you for that." That was a noticeably feminine voice.

I opened my stupid-ass mouth. "Are you the-"

She already knew what I was going to ask. "Do I sound like f'ing Martin? Do you see a black guy and ask if he's Obama?"

Yeah, that was fair. I deserved that. "Of course, I am so sorry." *Not* the GEICO gecko.

"I should just walk out for that, but it's a long fall and I'm already up here. I don't even know if lizards can have coffee. Are geckos lizards?"

That was a yes, I was certain of that. As for their capability of metabolizing caffeine, I did not know. "Maybe you could try something small?"

"Is that a joke, huh?"

"No, no. I mean just a sip to see if it upsets your stomach."

"Yeah, I'll do that. Just black. I want to taste something normal for once."

Her words heavily suggested that being a lizard was new to her, so I continued the theme of dumb questions in an attempt at small talk. "So, been a lizard for long?"

The gecko stared at me for a moment. "Did that sound better in your head?"

"Not really, no."

"Well, to be perfectly honest, I've only been like this for a month or so. Made a deal with some man-witch. I only wanted to know if my crush, Paul, liked me, but when I shook his hand I woke up like this. Can't find the bitch anywhere."

That sounded familiar. "So... you have to eat like a lizard too?"

"Well, seeing as I am gecko now, yeah. Gecko things."

"Like?"

"Bugs. Grub, crickets, flies-" She looked up to the buff fly. "No offense." It lifted an arm and shook its head, a clear dismissal of the need for an apology.

"Gross." Then, I found myself facing the fly. "Again, no offense." That gave it a laugh as it again waved off the apology.

That curdled latte smelled *horrible*. Em must have heard our conversation because she brought a small sample cup of coffee to the lizard, who's name I had yet to ask for. How rude of me. "I'm sorry, what is your name?"

"Laura." She smiled, I think.

Em shook the lizard's tiny hand. "You're not the first person to be turned into an animal around here. Lots of weird stuff in Rykar Valley, even weirder people. If you want, you're welcome to stay with me while you figure things out." That was a very generous offer. "I have some geckos as pets, so I know what they need. Though, I am not sure if you'd like their company."

"I might be a lizard for now, but I like people a lot more." She took a little sip of coffee, swallowed, and waited for a moment. Then, she proceeded to drop dead.

"Oh." I managed to get out before Em leapt into action.

She cursed under her breath. "Good to know! Gecko's can't have coffee!" Em hurried into the kitchen, nearly pushing John over as she rushed to save Laura's life.

The fly seemed concerned, but clearly recognized that it did not need to be involved in the situation. It gave a bow to Barrow and I before leaving out the front door and flying to god knows where. One of the many rules; one person must be at the front counter at all times. Barrow agreed to stay while I checked on our little friend. I guess pixies do have magic of some kind, because Em was sprinkling something that glittered onto Laura's face. I saw the weakest breath, the slightest shift in her chest, and felt a bit of relief.

Em turned and saw me. "I think she will live. I'll keep her at my place until she is better."

Better would be not being a lizard, I'd think, but I knew what she meant. "Good. I should have known lizards can't have coffee."

"None of us did. I don't think I've ever served one."

"First time for everything, right?"

"I'm literally crying right now." She wasn't kidding. "I thought she was already dead."

Laura hadn't woken, but she was still breathing when we locked up and went home. I don't know what sort of creature turned her into a lizard, but that didn't sound like fun so I made a mental note. It seemed like an all around bad idea to make any sort of deal with the things that come to the shop. So, even if you are desperate, don't shake the hand of a witch (man or woman) in the woods because lizards, as we've just learned, cannot have coffee.

I got more to tell y'all, but I've got to clock back on. Stay safe out there!
