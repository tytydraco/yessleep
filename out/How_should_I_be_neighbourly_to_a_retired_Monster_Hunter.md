Hello Guys, or gals, depending on who's reading this. I'm just writing this up to get a little bit of advice for this little peculiar situation I'm in. 

As for introductions, my name is Simon Flanagan. Born of the lineage of the not-so-memorable Flanagan-Mable bloodline. I have lived, and continue to live in a house just off the main highway leading into Mercer (Pennsylvania). It's a pretty respectable looking house, big, White bricks, black roof, double stories, you can't miss it, especially not in the desolate neighbourhood that is Grimshaw. My house is only the second biggest there. The next door neighbours have a massive mansion! Black wood, forboding, your classic Haunted House from the movies and whatnot.

Getting into that house, it's been vacant for all my years of living here. For reference, I'm only 27 (which is pathetic to still be living with my parents), and all that time this mysterious house next to mine hasn't been lived in. There are massive iron bars that surround the property, and a few weathered signs from real estate agents who have attempted to sell the thing. Probably tried to push their luck in terms of pricing. In today's economy? A straight buy would be well over a million dollars, easy. 

I wouldn't have expected anyone to actually take the hook, but I was wrong. About a week ago, a pack of moving trucks began swarming the driveway like a pack of dogs trying to get back into a backyard they broke out of. I was observing from the top story as they busted through the lock and chains with some tools and I continued to watch as they got to work. I was only just finishing up some medical theory assignments for my university, so I figured that once I finished up, I might as well go and meet the new neighbour. 

I hate to admit, but I already placed my bets on what kind of sucker he would be to have bought out a house like this. Even leading would be heavy on the purse strings. As I finished up this week's homework, I submitted it through an email, and I walked down my flight of stairs and towards the front door.

It was just before I got off my property line that an old car rolled in. You might read "old" and think "oh, Simon means something from the 70's to the 80's." I mean "old" as in- the new neighbour rocked up in a car that was comparable to a Model T. I took a photo with my phone, and my car-guy friend confirmed it to be a 1934 Packard, or whatever that is supposed to mean. My folks appeared behind me as a short, plump man appeared from the driver's seat. With him was a small, yappy dog. At first I thought "fox terrier" but upon closer inspection, it appeared more like a Jack Russel.

"Greetings, new Neighbours!"

He said with such gumption, I thought he may have won the lottery. Perhaps that's how he could buy this house? I offered my friendliest wave while my parents walked out to introduce themselves.

"Hello, I am Kam Mable, and this here is my wife - Sarah Flanagan-Mable."

My father, ever the commanding presence, beckoned for me to introduce myself.

"I'm Simon Flanagan. Pleasure to meet you, mister...?"

"Abe! Just call me Abe, my boy!"

He sounded giddy, like he hadn't had normal human contact in years, perhaps decades. He smiled politely, revealing that his front left tooth was gold. He really was a lottery winner. He waddled over to me to shake my hand, even though I hadn't even thought to offer my own hand. He griped my hand with a force I hadn't thought possible from a man his age. He looked older than the house, and that's saying something. Once he was done giving me a firm handshake, he walked over to my mother, and kissed her ring.

I thought that this was something only seen in movies, but my thoughts were only drowned out by the trucks starting up, and continuing down the long driveway leading up to the house. 

"Such a gentleman! Nice to meet you, Abe."

I hated it when my mother made those comments especially in that flirtatious tone. I do my best not to get in the way of my folks, especially, at my age, I'm only a stones throw away from being kicked out onto the street. Abe retreated once he heard the trucks gradually turn off at his front door, and he was only a few steps from his car when my mother called out:

"This Friday, we're having a great Steak dinner! You should join us, Abe!"

I couldn't help but crane my neck at her. "We? Who is we?" I would have said, if not for the happiness in her eyes. It was kryptonite, to both me and my father. We couldn't bear to see Mom down and out.

"Oh, I would be so delighted to join you kind souls! I'll spend the next few days unpacking, but come Friday, I will be at your door!"

After that, he jumped in his car, and after a steady start up, he continued to drive down that driveway and parked behind the trucks, and assisted the movers in loading his belongings into his house.

Me and my father, both turning to Mom, nodded and walked inside. Who were we to deny her a neighbourly thing to do, especially when that house had been abandoned for so long. We don't particularly have any close neighbours, and they all live halfway down the street, as opposed to the close hop-skip-and-jump it was to the newly purchased Abe-House that was next door.

Even so, I don't particularly like the way he acts in front of my mother. It was only a few seconds, but you shouldn't kiss a married woman's ring on her finger, right? I don't know.

Either way, that was a week ago. The dinner was nice, but... He was... I'll just say Strange.

Between mouthfuls of baked potato, gravy, and t-bone steak, he would ask each of us about our lives and occupations like we were all having our own privatized conversations.

"You- Sammy Boy-"

"It's Simon."

"Simon, my Boy- whats your career path looking like?"

"Well, I'm in my sixth year of medical university- going to try and be a doctor."

"Ah! A learnered boy like yourself would have done great back where I done come from!"

I paused. He paused. 

"Which is...?"

"England."

He spoke with the most redneck accent,  and I really didn't expect him to come from England or all places. Maybe if he swapped his accent out for a cockney one, I would have believed him.

"Ah, very nice. Not enough doctors over in the UK then?"

"No, no, not nearly enough my boy. You know, I used to work with cadavers that could well have been saved with the work of a doctor. Tut-tut too late for them I'spose."

"You're a Mortician or something?"

"Something to that effect, Simon Son."

Somehow, the more this man talked, the more I couldn't believe him. This guy was so shifty, so unbelievable that I just can't get behind him. Even so, I maintained my composure, for my mother's sake. 

"Simon boy, if you're interested in healing and working your magic with people and bodies, I think you might want to come around to my place for a night or two. I have a few books and tools and whatnot you might want to familiarize yourself with."

"Thank you for the offer, Abe."

Shortly after that, I excused myself from the dinner table, cleaned my dishes, and retreated to my room. I spent that night monitoring the amber lights coming from the house next door. Not for any particular reason, mainly just stewing on how comfortable this man was in another family's home. When he walked out the front of our house, though, he looked upwards at my window, meeting my stare with a devilish grin. It was like he just locked onto me. 

"Simon! Come around my house in two days and I can help you with your studies, eh?"

He shouted up at my window. At least it was better than him coming into my room

And those two days have passed. 
What do you guys suggest I do? I want to at least appear neighbourly, and I do want to find out the truth of this guy. He's far too... Strange just to not investigate. But I'll leave the floor to you guys. Just leave your suggestions down below and I'll check tomorrow. 

Thanks for your suggestions!!
