I didn't mean to bring it home. I thought it was another photo, like all the others-thousands of photos I have taken while exploring abandoned places. I've been into urban exploration for many years now and chase that feeling while stepping in places that have been forgotten, but this time, I brought something with me.



It started at the old Carrick Mansion, the place locals call "The House of Mirrors." I’d heard about it in a few forums. Supposedly, it used to belong to some eccentric artist, but it’s been rotting for decades. A perfect place for photography.

It was everything I'd hoped for. Grand, decaying, and unnervingly quiet-the sort of place that has you spinning around with every groan and creak of the old building. I'd been shooting my way through rooms for maybe an hour, dusty furniture and broken staircases, till I found it.

It was at the end of a very long, dark hall, and it stood a little open. Inside, there were mirrors lining the wall in every shape and size. They were not hung but simply leaned against the walls or even stacked in corners haphazardly. Most of them were cracked, their reflective surfaces warped, and they shared one other strange quality: they sucked the light.

I couldn't help myself, raising my camera and snapping off a shot of the room. The flash blinded me for a second; that was when I saw it. In one of the bigger mirrors-a high, gold thing leaning against the far wall-I saw a face that was clearly not mine.

A glimpse, a trick of the light-I told myself. Probably my reflection distorted by the cracked glass. But even after I lowered the camera, the face stayed with me.

I didn't really think too much of it then, finished up and packed my gear, then left. It wasn't until I got home and loaded the photos onto my computer that something seemed off. I mean, something is off.

That face showed in every picture taken of that room. Not fuzzy, either, or in the background. The face was out front: pale, just about gaunt, hollow-cheeked, and eyes staring into the camera. At me.



I tried to make a logical explanation for it graffiti, some weird reflection that I hadn't noticed. The face wasn't in just that one photo, either. It cropped up in other pictures, too-ones I'd taken after I had left the mansion. It showed in the window, in puddles of water on the ground, and even faintly on my computer screen when I peered hard at it.

And the worst part? The face wasn't just watching anymore. It was changing.

At first, it was subtle, just shifts in expression I convinced myself I was imagining. But over the next few days, it became undeniable. The hollow eyes seemed to focus, the lips twitched into the faintest of smirks. Then last night, I woke up to tapping.

It was coming from the mirror in my bedroom.

I didn't even think I had brought it in. It must have been one of the smaller ones that had been tucked away in my bag. It just leaned against the wall there. Its surface was misty, like someone had breathed on it, and in the dim light from my phone, I saw in the condensation these words:

Let me in.

I haven't slept since. I have tried throwing the mirror out, breaking it, even burning it-but every time I turn around, it's back, sitting exactly where it was before. Now the face is in every reflective surface: the bathroom mirror, my car windows, even the blank black screen of my TV.



I don't know what it wants, but a sense in the back of my head keeps growing that I am running out of time. It is no longer content with simply watching me. Last night, something cold swept along my shoulder, and in my reflection stood that figure, right behind me.

It was not smiling anymore.

If anyone knows how to get rid of this thing, for God's sake, tell me. I think this is trying to trade places with me, and I think it will succeed.
