Have you ever wondered who is behind the "first" comments, seen on YouTube and elsewhere? Maybe you think they're all small children buying into a dumb self-irony trend - that's what I thought too. Until, it started happening to me.

I was at university at the time, hoping to make a positive impact on the world through the development of neuropsychology, which I find a little ironic, looking back. I was a physically active young man with a close-knit friend group. We loved to go on walks and make each other laugh. It was a golden time.

It's a very subtle, unconscious thing - so it's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, but I remember feeling my energy going down. Little things, like not wanting to go for my daily walk, despite the fulfilment and headspace I knew it would bring me. Not bothering to make myself a meal and ordering takeaways instead.

I'd forget to hand in coursework, and then when I got in trouble with my tutors, I'd be indifferent about it. I'd get these annoying songs stuck in my head - songs I'd seen on YouTube. They played all throughout the day, sometimes even as I fell asleep.

I began to see people differently and I couldn't interact with my friends how I used to. My fear of the outside world fermented into a reclusive lifestyle. By this point, I was on the internet all hours of the day.

The more I read about the violence and treachery in the world, the more I lost myself in blurry emotions, until I couldn't even reason properly. I developed a cynical online persona, where I tried to convert other people, but soon even that broke down.

What I was left with, was a thin shell of my former self. Sat at my desk all day, eating snacks and takeaway food. And it was during that period I started commenting on YouTube videos.

At first, I put a lot of effort into writing things I thought would be seen as clever or witty, or even profound. Things that I thought would at least inspire people in some way. 

Over the space of months, however, the quality of my comments heavily degraded.

*"It's just a prank bro."*

*"LOL"*

*"Nah, that sum crazy shi"*

I was saying it all ironically, of course. But how long can you hide behind the veil of irony before it's just what you've become?

The quality of my submissions continued to drop, until I was typing things so incoherent and offensive, that calling it language didn't really qualify - things you might mistake for the grunting of a lobotomy patient.

*"huh?"*

*"wha?"*

*"nuh"*

In a bid to rescue my sanity, I latched onto the only trend I had the strength and attention left to understand.

So, when a new video popped up in my notifications, I immediately clicked on it and scrolled to type something. And I was genuinely proud to be the first one to do so.

Can you guess what it was?
