——————————————————————————————

I thought I could walk away from it. I told myself the thing I saw on the hill had been some kind of hallucination brought on by nerves and bad light, but the truth is I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Every time I closed my eyes I saw that grin, that tilt of its head, the sound of the music cutting in and out like a heartbeat. I needed answers, so I went back to the library. 

I didn’t know what I was looking for exactly—maybe newspaper clippings, maybe some old photograph I could stare at long enough to convince myself it had all been in my head. But the more I read, the less room there was for doubt. The Casanova Carnival hadn’t just been a sideshow curiosity; it was something darker, something the town itself had chosen to bury.

Most of the papers from 1950 were fragile, the ink faded to a faint blue that made my eyes ache when I tried to read them. Still, there were patterns I couldn’t ignore. In the weeks leading up to the fire, the carnival was advertised almost daily, and yet the posters and articles never named the performers—only the attractions: the boneless man, the mirrored girl, the twins who spoke in one voice. 

Every single description blurred the line between spectacle and nightmare, and I wondered if those things had ever been people at all. Then, after the fire, the coverage dropped off sharply. A single headline reported: Thirty Presumed Dead in Hilltop Blaze, and beneath it a photo of the carnival grounds reduced to black skeletons of wood and iron. But the strangest thing was in the margins of the missing persons lists that followed. I found one in the microfilm archive, a roll the librarian said nobody had touched in decades.

As the names scrolled past, I noticed every seventh entry had been crossed out—not neatly, but violently, with a thick stroke of ink that almost tore through the page. When I tried to print the frame, the machine jammed, and the image burned into the glass like a scar.

I should have left then, but I couldn’t. I told myself I was uncovering history, that I was giving my grandmother a voice after all those years of silence. That’s when I found the journal.

It wasn’t labeled, wasn’t even catalogued. I only noticed it because while pulling a box of municipal records off the bottom shelf, I saw the corner of something wedged behind it. A plain leather notebook, warped by smoke and stiff with age. The archivist hadn’t mentioned it, and from the dust caked along its spine, I doubted anyone had touched it in decades.

The first pages looked like notes—ledger entries, names, dates—but midway through, the handwriting shifted. The letters grew cramped, frantic, the ink darker where the pen dug too hard into the paper. There were warnings written between lines of lists: Don’t look in the tents after dark. Don’t answer the music. Don’t speak to the Ringmaster. The last line was repeated three times, underlined until the paper nearly tore.

I turned the page and something slipped out—a carnival ticket, flattened and brittle as old leaves. The edges were scorched, same as the ones I’d found in my grandmother’s tin box. But this one carried something else. A faint spiral pressed into its center, not ink but a burn, like the mark had been seared into the paper itself. When I tilted it, the pattern seemed to shift, to pull, as though the lines were curling inward without moving at all.

I sat with the journal longer than I meant to. The words didn’t feel like something I was supposed to read. The author hadn’t been writing for posterity, they were writing like someone leaving warnings scratched on a wall, hoping the next poor soul would listen. My hands shook as I copied a few passages into my notebook, and when I slipped the carnival stub back between the pages, the brittle paper nearly broke in half.

The archivist came around the corner just then, pushing a cart stacked with boxes. She looked at the journal in my hands, frowned, and said she hadn’t seen it before. When I tried to ask if I could check it out, she only shook her head and said it wasn’t catalogued—it shouldn’t even be here. I left it on her desk, but walking back to my car, it felt like the weight of it had followed me, like my pockets were heavier even though they were empty.

By the time I got home, it was full dark. I shut the door, locked it, and for the first time in a long while, double-checked the latch. The house was quiet, but not in the usual way. Every sound was sharper, every shadow seemed to hang too long. I made coffee I didn’t need, flipped open my notebook, and tried to distract myself by going over the copied entries. But the words blurred, the spiral mark on the page seeming to shift when I glanced at it.

I rubbed my eyes, looked up— —and something was standing in the corner of the room.

At first I thought it was my coat hung on the rack, but the shape moved. It unfolded itself, joints popping wetly as it stretched upright, arms too long and thin. Its head lolled against its chest, then jerked back with a sharp crack. That was when the smell hit me—iron and rot, like an animal carcass left in the sun too long.

It wasn’t just the same thing I’d seen at the carnival grounds. It was worse. Parts of it looked torn, mangled, as though it had been caught in machinery. Its ribcage jutted outward in jagged peaks, skin stretched thin and glossy between them like wax paper. Muscle hung loose at its side, strands swaying as it stepped closer, each movement wet and deliberate.

I stumbled back, chair clattering over. It hissed—a sound like air pushed through a broken reed—and then it lunged.

We crashed into the table. My notebook scattered across the floor. Its hands—if you could call them that—were more like claws, fingers bending backward, nails cracked and blackened. One slashed across my arm and I felt the sting before I saw the blood. I grabbed the nearest thing—my coffee mug—and smashed it into its face. The mug shattered, scalding liquid running down both of us. It screamed then, a high, whistling keen that rattled my teeth.

I don’t remember thinking, only moving. I shoved it back, grabbed the fireplace poker from the corner, and drove it into the thing’s chest. The resistance was awful—like pushing through wet clay—before it gave way with a snap. The thing convulsed, body folding in on itself, and hit the floor with a sound like meat slapped on tile.

I stood there gasping, poker still in my hands, staring down at it. For a moment I thought it was dead, but then its chest rose, hitching, and from deep inside it came that sound—the slow, wheezing rise of carnival pipes, faint but growing louder, filling the room with broken music.

That was when I knew. Whatever I’d killed wasn’t the only one.
