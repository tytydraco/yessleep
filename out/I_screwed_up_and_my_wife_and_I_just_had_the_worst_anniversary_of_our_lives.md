I’ll make this quick.  I’m so numb that I haven’t had a chance really to process my grief yet. Maybe I never will. It’s possible that posting about this here isn’t exactly a great idea for my mental health, but what else can I do? I need to get out what I’m feeling, and this is as good a place as any I suppose. 

So, this happened the other evening. Right in front of my very eyes. The love of my life for over sixty years was taken from me in an instant and I was completely powerless to stop it. And of all fucking things, it was the result of gun violence.

You know what the saddest thing is? We could hear them coming. Shouting and chanting. If I had a time machine I would go back to that very moment and scream for us to run. I just… I mean how could I have known they would have been so evil?  

I remember looking over at my wife that evening, thinking just how beautiful she was. How lucky I was to be spending our anniversary in such a magical place with such a wonderful history.  

How did I get so lucky? How did someone like her choose someone like me?

The shouting was getting closer. Our seat outside, under the warm nighttime air, seemed perfect. We could see the other patrons look around nervously as the shouting got closer. We could tell what they were thinking. Was this really happening? Are they actually going through with this?

We heard a few screams in the distance, but it was hard to tell what they were. Were they shouts of pain or anger? It soon became impossible to tell over all the approaching noise…

The first one to get shot was someone from London. A boy really, that stood up smiling awkwardly. It looked like he tried to jump over and position himself in front of his date. It was pointless though. They shouted at him and then shot him, right there, almost from point blank range.

Now here is where the really pathetic and sad part is. Even at that moment, after the scrawny boy was shot, I didn’t think they were serious. I sat there and smiled at my wife and told her there was no way this was happening. It was just rumor.

The boy that was just shot was then shot again by another person. Then another one joined in and shot him over and over again.

Of course, the boy laughed. His girlfriend, with her much healthier look, seemed annoyed with his stunt.  She seemed more intent on covering her leather bag than paying attention to her less appetizing boyfriend.  

“El turisme massiu mata els barris!!!!”, they shouted to their victims. Many of them now leaving the restaurant frustrated at their ruined evening.

My wife and I though didn’t budge. I guess you could call it arrogance. We weren’t going to let these people ruin our special night. There was a moment when one of them raised their gun and pointed it at my wife. I had a split second to react. I could have done the same thing as the boy. Jump up and stand in between my wife and this gun wielding maniac.  

Instead, I sat there, smiling with a fake smile. The rumor we heard about La Benedicció Clandestina had instilled enough fear into me that I  sat there like an shameless coward.

It was over in an instant. The flames shot up to the stars as the sudden heat pushed me out of my chair. The shooter’s shouts of frustration turned to a sudden scream of surprise.  

It was over so fast.  

Even in the air I could feel death, the lethal particles floating around, otherwise I would have ran to the murderer and ended them. But like a coward, I fled. I tried to run to the hotel, but the street was blocked so I ran to the university. Someone even tried handing me a gun, thinking I was some student protestor.  

That night I barely made it out of the city. The city that we loved. At this point I don’t even know what I should I do.  My wife is gone, and I only have myself to blame. I know I wasn’t the only one, I heard they got others with their plan.

Anyway, that’s my story. I guess if anything maybe this shows that you shouldn’t get too comfortable with where you are at. It can all be taken from you in an instant so enjoy the time you have with your loved ones while you can.
