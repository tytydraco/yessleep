I had never been one to get scared easily, watching horror movies late into the night while my husband slept upstairs, reading creepypastas, hell even coming up with bone chilling camp fire stories with my friends during sleep overs when we were young.

All that changed just a week ago. 

I don’t know who… no.. I don’t know WHAT this thing is. I got up from binging a bunch of horror videos on YouTube with a sudden craving for something salty. 

When I entered my kitchen it was dark save for the glow from my phone, my fingers swiped to one more short an eerie song sounding from the speakers when I looked up. From the distance under a light pole in the street I saw someone.. something standing there. 

My eyes glanced at the clock on my stove and it read 1:05. ‘What an odd time for someone to be outside’ I had thought to myself. I stepped closer to the open window over my sink to get a closer look, just to see if they needed any help. 

“Hey!” I called out. As soon as it turned to me my blood ran cold. Its eyes were bloodshot, the pupils expanded so much the color of its eyes looked black, but now that I think back on it I’m really not even sure it had an iris, just a gaping black hole where it should have been. Its bloodshot hollow eyes was accompanied by thick black rims surrounding the eyes, dark circles and sunken in cheeks as if the person hadn’t slept in weeks. 

The thing that got me the most wasn’t the appearance of it though, no it was the images that popped up in my head and the feeling that over came me. I saw myself as an old withered woman, my face wrinkled from age as I laid in a bed. In the image my husband was no where to be seen and tears streaked my cheeks as I feel asleep just to never wake up again. The feeling that washed over me was sorrow. A wrenching sorrow that ran so deep I can’t even begin to explain it with words, then nothing. Just an emptiness. 

The next thing I knew I was waking up in a stupor on my kitchen floor. When I got myself back up and looked outside the thing was gone and the time on the stove clock now read 2:00. I had been in so much shock at what I had experienced I passed out for almost an hour.

I went to bed that night shaken, the warmth of my husband’s body next to me barely able to calm me to sleep. 

The next night I had told myself I just imagined it, I was just exhausted from my work week and maybe just maybe all the horror I was consuming on an almost nightly basis was getting to me.

Until I saw it again.

Like the night before I had entered my kitchen ready for a glass of water after watching one too many horror movies since it was my day off. When I looked outside the window with my glass in my hand I almost dropped it.

There it was, only closer now. Instead of across the street it now stood at the back steps, an eerily wide smile plastered on its face as my eyes scanned up its body until my eyes met it’s own pit like ones. 

Just like the night before images filled my mind only this time I younger, maybe early to mid 50’s. I saw myself walking down an almost deserted road stumbling ever so slightly while the neon sign of a bar flickered not far behind me. A man approached me, I couldn’t make out his face because of his gray hoodie being pulled up over his head, the fabric casting dark shadows over his face. Suddenly he pulled out a gun and aimed it at me. “Give me your money bitch!” He had yelled.

The image of me laughed and shook its head before slurring some incomprehensible sentence. It seemed the man didn’t like that as the next moment all I heard was a bang and my body hit the hard concrete. Relaxation was what I felt before the bullet entered my image, then cold dread and fear before I just felt numb again.

That night I had hardly slept. Whatever that thing was it was showing me my deaths, or possible deaths really. I refused to explain to my husband what was wrong with me the next day when he continuously asked me what was wrong, why I had dark circles under my eyes and why I seemed so spooked.

It continued to visit me, night after night, getting closer and closer to me while showing me and allowing me to feel my last moments as the images got younger and younger.

Last night I had decided to stay in my room my phone the only source of light I had in the other wise pitch dark room while my husband snored next to me. As I felt the only way to protect myself from the horrors I was envisioning night after night was to avoid the downstairs entirely. Oh how nieve I was.

I heard the bedroom door creek open and made the mistake of looking over. It was there, less than 3 feet from me and my bed. The last death it allowed me to see was far too horrific for me to even begin to want to type out without experiencing a panic attack. It was me just a few years older than I am now and my death was brutal. 

I now type this from under my covers, fingers shacking and breath shuddering. I heard the door open again about 10 minutes ago and I can feel it right next to me. I fear if I look it in the eyes I will die. Theirs no doubt in my mind this vision won’t be a vision it will be just me experiencing my own death.

So now I type this from under my bed while it’s breathing gets heavier, more excited as I feel it almost shuddering with glee. 

If you are a night person like me don’t ever look outside, and if you see someone standing under a light post don’t make my mistake and just ignore it.
