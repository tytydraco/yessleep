I’ve always been an overly cautious person, even as a child. I rarely ever do anything without imagining every possible outcome that could occur, but i tend to mainly focus on the negatives. Blame it on bad childhood or whatever, but I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember. 

When I turned 19, I got diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. My mind would throw itself into these horrible scenarios and as a result I’d start hearing things or sometimes seeing them. Often random things coinciding with my delusions, voices of people I believed wanted to harm me, footsteps in an empty house or knocks on the door with nobody there, small things that could be heard clearly, with no confusion as to what they were. 

Over the years, things slowly got better. I went to therapy, found a great husband who supports me and a loving dog who often helps me distinguish if I’m hallucinating or not, but through all of that, one hallucination that has stayed has been the music box. 

This particular hallucination didn’t start until I moved into this house with my husband, an older double wide trailer out in the country, surrounded by trees. I often hear it at night, randomly. I’m never able to predict when I’ll hear it again, but it’s always the same. The sound of a music box coming from the woods behind the house, just loud enough to hear but feint enough to completely disappear if I try to focus on it. It always gives me this strong urge to go out and follow it, to find the source of the sound. I never do. I don’t know these woods that well and I’m terrified of getting lost. 

A few months ago, a friend of ours gave us some old porcelain dolls. My husband is a huge fan of them and I don’t mind them either. My mother in law loves them as well and just recently lost her whole collection, so last night my husband and I were going through the ones we have to possibly gift one to her for Christmas. We decided on this cute little red haired one, designed to look like it’s sitting, but as we were looking at it we discovered a little wide key on its back. Aside from the creepy music from the woods, I am quite a fan of music boxes so I turned the key a few times, excited to hear the tune. That excitement quickly faded, however, as this doll holds the same tune that I’ve been hearing for years. 

I asked my friend about it and she said she wasn’t sure where she got it from, but that she was eager to get rid of it. She said she used to have it in her room as a child and strange things would happen often, odd sounds, shadow figures, objects moving when they shouldn’t. Said she just assumed she had an overactive imagination as a child. 

The worst part is, when I played it for my husband, to show him what I’ve been hearing all these years, he said that he’s heard it too, multiple times, but just chalked it up to random hallucinations or often times sleep deprivation. 

I put it on our fireplace mantle for the time being, I don’t know what to do with this thing. How is it possible that we’ve been sharing the same hallucination all these years? Is it even actually a hallucination in that case? This thing freaks me the hell out. I’m sitting on the couch but keep getting the urge to look back at this doll, expecting, waiting for it to move.
