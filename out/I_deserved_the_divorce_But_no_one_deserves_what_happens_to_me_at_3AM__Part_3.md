My name is Evan. I made a drunken deal with my ex’s inhuman lawyer, and my friends are trying to get me out of it.

If you’ve missed my earlier updates, I’ve linked them above.

Kevin and I posted up at our friend Jacob’s place to plan for the early morning hour.  I watched the last light fade out on the street through the bay windows. 

The tires of passing cars splashed through shallow puddles. As the hours crept later, fewer and fewer drivers passed the house; until the only sound was the gentle tapping of the rain on the glass, and Jacob’s pacing.

He’d been circling the coffee table with his yellow legal pad, pausing to make a note here and there, or consult his stack of law books.

None of us felt much like talking. I could feel the anticipation growing in my limbs — the kind of sensation you get when you’re hopped up on caffeine, on an empty stomach.

At quarter to 3, Kevin started wiring me up with equipment he’d borrowed from his job at an indie movie studio: a microphone, and body camera.

“Your clothes and phone vanished with you,” he reasoned. “This should be no different.” 

“That’s assuming you still disappear, with us watching you.” Jacob took a break from his pacing to join the conversation.

“It’s almost time.” Kevin pointed at the clock.

“I don’t think I can do this.” I held up my hands, and showed them my twitching fingers. “I’m shaking.”

Kevin patted me on the back. “You’ve done this before, alone. We’ve got you. Just try and relax.”

“Okay.” I put my feet up on the couch, and propped my head up on a mountain of pillows. 

Jacob traced a line through the air from my eyes, to a spot in the kitchen by the wall. “Right about there, is where G should be joining us.” He set his pad down on the table, and started talking to himself, rehearsing his arguments to the spot along the wall. 

“Two minutes,” Kevin said. “You’ll be okay. Just do your part, like we practiced.” Kevin clapped his hand on my shoulder before retreating to the kitchen table. He adjusted his video camera, trained on the spot where Jacob pointed.

The lights didn’t exactly dim—the bulbs still looked bright when I looked at them directly— the shadows just seemed to grow stronger, creeping farther from the corners until they dominated the room.

G’s face emerged from the dark, as if he were poking through a curtain. He did not seem the slightest bit perturbed I wasn’t alone. 

“Do you aim to stop me from collecting your payment?” G asked me.

I didn’t answer, I just focused on my job: keeping my eyes open long enough for Jacob to talk.

“You’re not collecting anything—not on that half-baked handshake agreement you cooked up,” Jacob said.

G turned toward him. “And you might be?”

“Jacob Crane, I’ll be representing Evan Hinkle in this matter,” he said. “My client had neither the understanding, nor the clarity to consent to any agreement you may have offered him. He was never even shown a contract. That wouldn’t hold up in any earthly court I can think of.”

G laughed. “The temporal tribunal is not an earthly court. We take handshake agreements very seriously.”

“How about coherence?” Jacob asked. “Because my client was intoxicated and distraught when you approached him with your offer—a fact which you exploited to get him to agree to terms he would’ve rejected, had he been thinking straight.”

“What an interesting gambit.” G stepped into what little light remained in the room, revealing the rest of his body. “I’ve seen attempts to Welch on agreements before, but never hiring a human lawyer to wriggle out for you.”

My eyes began to water.

Jacob ignored the comment. “You threatened to take Evan to court, so you have to operate with some kind of magistrate, yes?” 

G scowled, clearly not used to being challenged. “He’s not exactly what you would see in a mortal courtroom. But yes, there is a judge.”

“Then I demand a hearing.” Jacob straightened his spine. “I intend to file an injunction to stop all further collection of my client’s time until we can work out a proper agreement.”

G cracked a smile. “This should be good. Airtight, hot shot. Let’s go see the judge.”

“Right now?” Jacob’s voice faltered.

“When else?” G sneered. He turned to me. “And until I see an injunction, I have every right to continue collecting payment. Close your eyes.” He clapped his hands in front of my face. 

I blinked.

G and Jacob were both gone. 

Golden, early morning light filtered in through the window. Kevin paced around the kitchen table. He jumped in surprise when he saw me. 

“You’re back!” He rushed across the room, and removed the camera and microphone rig from my chest.

I looked around. “Where is Jacob.”

“He disappeared too. Vanished when G did.”

“And he’s still gone?”

“Afraid so.” Kevin crossed the room and plugged the camera into his laptop. “Let’s see what—huh… interesting.”

Despite my concern for Jacob, my curiosity got the best of me. I got up from the couch and pulled up a chair beside Kevin. He had a video window pulled up on the screen. The clip was just black.”

“It didn’t work?”

“Oh, it worked, just not the way we were expecting,” he said. “The recording looks blank, but it’s a little less than three hours long.”

“Exactly how long I’ve been gone.”

“Bingo. It’s also not silent; we got audio.” Kevin unplugged his headphones and hit play. 

I’m having a hard time describing exactly what I heard. I’d compare it to the ambient noise a radiator makes; steam passing through hollow steel. It came with this almost inaudible, low frequency pulse, like an enormous engine chugging along, far away. Every few moments, the soundscape would be interrupted by what resembled the rattling breath of a massive, slumbering creature. 

“What the hell is that?” I asked. 

“You tell me.”

I squinted at the screen. “Did something move, there?”

“Let me see.” Kevin rewound the clip, and pressed play. 

“There!” I pointed.

“Hang on.” Kevin bumped up the brightness as high as it would go. At that level, the screen looked like a night sky full of swirling storm clouds.

So the video did work. I was starting to think it wouldn’t,” Kevin said. “G didn’t show up on film, or video.”

Jacob snapped back into existence across from us at the table, alongside that hideous suit-skinned creature.

I flinched. 

“Holy hell,” Kevin said.

Jacob looked shell-shocked and disheveled. Stubble had sprouted along his jaw line. His clothes were wrinkled.

I finally found the courage to ask:  “Did it work?” 

“Sorta,” Jacob said. 

“Then why is he still here?” I pointed at the being that haunted my nights.

“Still here?” It—he, spoke in a voice I hadn’t heard before. “Sir, I don’t believe we’ve had the pleasure of meeting. Most clients call me R.” He held out his hand. I shook it, wincing at the feel of his skin.

“But you look—“ 

“Exactly like your ex wife’s lawyer,” he finished. “Yes, I understand you humans have a hard time telling us apart.“

“I went into court, ready to get you an injunction. Then I saw the judge…” Jacob trailed off, his skin going pale.

“Mortals are often surprised at the sight of our magistrate,” R explained. “I took pity. Jumped in on your behalf. Got your injunction. G won’t be taking any more of your hours—at least for now.”

“R will be taking over your case,” Jacob explained. “Pro bono.”

I couldn’t believe it. “You’re serious?”

R pushed his spectacles up the bridge of his nose. “G is something of a thorn in my side. Call it a professional rivalry.

“I’d be happy to bring your case before the court… or negotiate a more equitable out of court settlement with your ex wife. It’s ultimately your call.”

I mulled over the words for a moment. “You’re my lawyer, right? What would you advise?”

“G’s offer may have been predatory. But your ex wife has a decent claim. I can probably knock the settlement down to one hour a night, and one day per week.”

“I’d still have HIM coming to collect, then.” I looked down at my hands.

“Afraid so,” he said. “There’s another option. It’s more risky. But I think it can get you off the hook, almost entirely.” 

“That sounds too good to be true,” Jacob interjected. 

“For a lesser lawyer, perhaps,” R quipped. “I happen to be very good, if you’ll take a leap of faith. You take a chance either way. Take some time to think on it. Jacob tells me you have visitation with your kids this weekend?”

I nodded. 

“Go enjoy it. Spend time with your loved ones. Call me when you decide.” R handed me a business card. I ran my fingers over the embossed letters. 

“R’G’ak Kubori, Kubori & Tet, Temporal Legal Services.” Beneath the name was a number. “You guys have cell phones?” I looked up, and he was gone.

My head is still spinning from all of this. I don’t know what to make of this weird footage and sounds Kevin’s camera recorded. As for R’s offer… I can’t shake the feeling he has ulterior motives.
