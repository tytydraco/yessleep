When I arrived in Seattle for grandma's funeral and to talk to her lawyer to tie up a few loose ends, I stopped at the house to clean it. Not that it was dirty, there was just lots of stuff. Antique porcelain dolls, nutcrackers, sand dollars and a whole bunch of other things that old people keep around.

Ever since I could remember my grandmother raised me and now that she passed away I won’t ever have a chance to patch things up with her. The last time we spoke, it was about my parents, a topic she was always tight lipped about for reasons that I didn’t understand. 

Since I didn't even have a picture of mom and dad I couldn't even say for certain that I could pick them out in a lineup.

As I was cleaning up grandma's stuff I put the things I wanted to keep in a neat pile while the rest was set aside or got tossed in the garbage. 

I saved my grandma's room for last. I really didn't want to go inside because that was where her body was found. When I opened the door I couldn't help but to think that she was going to be there like she always was. However she wasn't brushing her hair in front of the mirror or lying in bed, and the realization that I would never see her again hit hard. 

As I cleaned her room, taking special care of the clothes that still smelt like the woman who took care of me my entire life, I came across a cardboard box tucked away in her closet behind a false wall I accidentally discovered when I dropped the hats she would wear for church. 

In the box was an old film projector and a reel that suffered from water damage so I didn't risk trying to play it. I would have to find someone who specializes in fixing something like that if I wanted to see what was on it. 

Also in the box were water damaged files with the word “Authorized Personnel Only”. I struggled to make sense of those words for a while because grandma's sole income came from the church and being a part time cashier at a car wash. 

Why did she have anything like this hidden away in her room?

Curiously, I opened the files. I don't know what I was hoping for, but the contents only raised more questions. 

Most of the pages were nearly impossible to read due to the excessive water damage, and the rest of them were heavily redacted. The only thing I could ascertain from them was something called “Project: Diogenes”. 

I did what I could to read the files but other than the name of the project and a few damaged pictures of buildings and a group picture that was paperclipped to the papers, I had nothing else to go on. 

In the group picture I couldn’t make out any faces because of the damage, however I could see they all wore white doctor uniforms. 

Luckily, Reddit has a sub for everything and I was able to find someone close by who could restore the reel of film. The woman I spoke to was pleasant and told me once she was done making the old film digital I would just have to go to her business website, type in a personalized code and I would be able to see what was on that reel. She also told me not to expect a miracle since the footage was heavily damaged.

For the next week I stayed in Seattle and set up funeral arrangements, talked to a realtor to sell the house and other odds and ends. If I wasn't thinking about my grandma I was thinking about what I found in her closet.

The funeral was as nice as one could expect. Not a lot of people showed up but this wasn't surprising. After all, once people live to be a certain age most of the people they know wouldn't be around to attend their wake. 

The day after the funeral, the woman who was fixing up the footage called me and said it was ready. After paying her for her services I went back to grandma's house and opened my computer and went to her website. There I entered the username, a password she gave me and from there I was directed straight to the film.

The footage was filmed in black and white, it was grainy, damaged and there was no sound. 

As I watched the film I saw kids in what looked like a camp. They were having fun playing in the dirt, eating in the mess hall, making their bunk beds, making faces at the camera and doing everything else one would expect from kids at that age.

I’ve felt deja vu before, but never like this. There was a sinking feeling in my belly and I was sweating and shaking. 

I had to force myself to watch the rest. 

After a few minutes the footage then showed a boy, perhaps three years old, playing with wooden blocks at a table. While the boy was in one room, he was being filmed on the other side of a one way mirror like interrogation rooms often seen in movies and television shows.

It took a few moments to realize that the boy was actually me. 

Then after a few moments a woman came into the room with a cat. I recognized the woman immediately, it was grandma. 

Three year old me was ecstatic at the sight of the cat and hopped out of my chair to go towards it, however the back of someone's head came into view and spoke into a microphone, causing me to sit back down. 

The cat was put on the floor and grandma left the room, leaving me alone in the room with it.

Whoever spoke into the microphone asked me questions and because there was no sound I had no idea what was said, only that I would respond with ‘yes’ or ‘no’.

My gut was screaming at me to turn off the film, but I didn't listen. 

The man who was talking to me over the microphone looked at the camera and spoke for a long time. I don't know what was said because I don't read lips. When he was finally done he looked over to someone off screen and asked a question. Getting the answer he wanted made him brighten up, smile and nod before saying something to me over the microphone.

At this point the camera zoomed in and my three year old face contorted. I looked feral. Seeing this was frightening, but it was nothing compared to when three year old me lunged at the cat and started to tear it apart.

All I could do was stare at the computer in horror.

The camera zoomed out, revealing the man who spoke into the microphone. He was smiling and talking to the other people in the room as they drank champagne in celebration. It was then that I saw the people he was addressing. Seeing them made me gasp. I knew who they were, or at least I thought I did. 

They were the faces I attributed as mom and dad. 

I couldn't breathe. 

Did my imagination trick me into thinking that the man and the woman in charge of Project Diogenes were my mom and dad? Were they my real mom and dad? 

God, that would be even worse.

After watching the video I dove headfirst into research with the hopes of finding out whatever I could. The only thing that came close to explaining what I saw was a Manchurian Candidate. Even though I don't want to believe a phrase could turn a normal person into a killer, I don't know how else to explain what I saw.

As I thought about the possibility that I could still be brainwashed and made to do terrible things, the phone rang.

Seeing that it was an unknown caller sent shivers up my spine. It could just be a telemarketer, chances are it was, God knows I get plenty of those. However the thought that it might be someone who knew the phrase that triggers whatever was done with me was enough for me to cancel my phone [service](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhisperAlleyEchos/).
