I woke up to a text from him which I wasn’t all surprised by as he said he would text me. Why didn’t he message me when I got home right away? Didn’t he want to know if I got in safe? I know he walked me to my door but is that really enough these days? Hasn’t everybody got to try to stand out? 

I get out of bed, slowly adjusting to the daylight spilling through the gap in my curtains, and head to the bathroom. I brush my teeth in the shower, scrape my hair back and begin picking up some clothes I’d left on the floor to find anything suitable to wear to the office. I hated office days but everyone keeps telling me they’re better for my mental health so why does it make me so sad to actually have to talk to people I don’t like?

I find an old blouse that doesn’t look too creased. Good enough. I put my navy trousers on. They’re tighter than I remember. I blame the pizza I ordered last night. You’re supposed to not look like a fat pig on a first date but he was buying, or I was going to hint that he should, and it would be a nice treat to have something that wasn’t a Pot Noodle or a Tesco’s sandwich. I reluctantly say goodbye to my bedroom, my home, my palace, the duvet cast aside on the floor, most likely covering the half-empty cup of tea I remember making last night. 

I wipe my eyes and head down the stairs. I did drink a lot last night, didn’t I? Are you supposed to drink that much on a first date? He’d ordered a beer when I’d hoped he’d order a bottle of wine to share because drinking by the glass is lame. 

Kirsten was in the kitchen clicking away on her laptop. She wrote so furiously. FUCK OFF Kirsten. 

“Morning,” I say to her, beaming.

She nods and wishes me good morning too, not looking up from her laptop screen. She thinks she’s important, that’s the thing with Kirsten. But she lives here with me, paying the same amount of rent. And I have fucking nothing. So she can’t be *that* important.

I find my Chilly flask from the cupboard, expertly pushed right to the back by Kirsten, so I push other mugs out of the way to retrieve it, making sure if I saw the one that was Kirsten’s favourite, it would replace my flask. She didn’t drink coffee. I don’t think anyway? I can’t remember. We never spoke anymore. It was her place - well, her flatmate moved out and she’d put the ad in the paper. She definitely didn’t own it because Darren our landlord once sent me a picture of his dick. I found him on Facebook and his profile picture had a woman in it. I hovered over messaging her for so long before I decided against it. Sleeping outside looks rough. 

“I’m out today. I’ll be back at around six,” I tell her.

“Okay, I’ll be in all day.”

“Cool.”

“Yeah it is. Might need a coat today.”

I didn’t let her talk anymore. When we met, she’d insisted on not just showing me around but taking me out for a glass of wine. To get to know me better. I didn’t mind because I’d been living at my Dad’s so long that if they drafted me up to fight in Ukraine, I’d be eager. She had seemed nice but I had my friends and didn’t need anymore so I’d let her natter on. She probably explained what she did, why she was single, why she loved her job that night but after the third glass I’d stopped paying attention. I was just happy to be in the company of someone new. Someone who didn’t know me. 

The best thing about my apartment is that it is so close to a Tube stop. That’s fucking rare in London. Even when the place is full of Tubes. I tap my card, descend on the esculator before I remember my headphones and look to find them in my coat pocket. The low battery warning blared before playing whatever nonsense I’d been playing when I’d got home. The Carpenter’s Greatest Hits. Who the fuck are they?

I try not to look on my phone. It’s harder than you think. When the alarm sirened, dragging me from my peaceless sleep, it’d just said his name and ‘iMessage’. I didn’t like to know what they sent straight away. If Abbie or Katie text me, usually ‘hey hows it going’ or ‘what was the place called where we went jet skiing in 2017? x’, I could at least pretend for a moment they had something important to say. No. He should’ve text me when I got home last night. He walked me to my door, Ariana, cut him some slack. Urgh. Am I one of these people who refer to themselves in the third person?

6 mins until the next train. That’s too long in 2025. Everything I want at my fingertips except reliable public transport. I put some Rihanna on and tried to groove and got on the train. I found myself tapping, nodding along to the beat like those weirdos you see alone on the tube. Urgh, this fucking headache. Why didn’t I take some paracetamol this morning? Why did I waste my time talking to Kirsten about coats when I could’ve been medicating myself. 

Fumbling through my coat pocket, I found the remanants of a disposable vape. I look around, deciding whether I’m sneaky enough to get a quick vape before someone gives me the stare. It’s too busy, I’ll wait till I get off. Besides, there won’t be any left anyway. 

At the office, Dan greets me. He’s gay. Or he looks gay. He says he hasn’t seen me in a while and I told him I’m always working from home and he says I need to come in more and see everyone and I don’t say anything back but smile and walk to my desk.

It’s got a package on it, weirdly. I never got post. Who gets post delivered to work?

“It’s your new desk decorations as part of the rebrand,” Charlotte says, the girl who sits behind me. She’s got a cup of tea and now I want one.

“Why’s there so much cardboard?”

“You know these corporate types,” she says, sitting down and clicking the keys to fire up the monitor, “they want the world to burn.”

“Don’t we all?”

Charlotte laughs. She’s worked here about a month less than I have but she definitely likes it more than I do. She goes out after work with a few of the younger, more vibrant types in Accounting and Commercial. I’d rather drive pins in my eyes. My Friday nights are messaging Katie and Abbie in our dwindling WhatsApp group asking if they’ve got plans. They’ve both got boyfriends, Abbie’s now a fiancee, and their weekends are planned well in advance. Spotaneity only belongs the young and naive and the single.

I start working. I don’t do any more or any less than I do at home. Nobody cares but I hope somebody will notice and just decide to keep me there. We have a rota of who can work from home. Often on days I’m due in, I’ll say I’m not feeling 100% and they usually let me. 

I hate asking for permission. I’m twenty-six years old.

At lunch time, I nip out to the Tesco’s, get myself a meal deal and return to my desk. I’m not eating in the break room today unless Simon’s in but I can’t see him and it isn’t worth the social humilation of circling, not finding a group to call your own to sit with and returning to your desk. Best just head for a soft and easy landing on your desk. I brush the crumbs off my desk and onto the floor, flicking through my phone and check the messages. 

*I had a nice time tonight. Thanks. See you soon? X*

  
One kiss is good. We hadn’t exchanged any before that message. It’s a declaration of war to send the first X. I wonder if younger people send five/six to each other like the world is an orgy. It’s a good message. I’m happy. I send him a short one back.

Seconds later, three dots appear. Fucking score. 



 \----					

I get home after the time I told Kirsten. I’m still craving pizza so I bought a frozen one on the way home. Who does their full food shop at six o’clock on a weekday though? Psychopaths, that’s who. I put the pizza into the cold oven and whack the tempature up. I delude myself that I don’t want to go on TikTok and spend the entire time the pizza takes to cook scrolling on it so I reread the messages I exchanged with Teddy earlier today. 

We were back and forth like Ross and Rachel. He’d say something and then I’d say something back. How about that? We spoke about the dinner we had last night. We spoke about our weekend plans - it was Thursday so it was important to not be alone for the weekend! The last message was the best one. He asked if I fancied going to see Wicked in the West End and then dinner afterwards. A show? What kind of fucking Prince Charming takes someone to see a show on their second date? I said yes, jumped around a little on my chair in the office, and skipped home. Everywhere I went, people started applauding me for landing a second date. “It was nothing, really,” I tell them. “He just did what he was supposed to.”

The pizza’s done and I slide it onto a plate expertly. Armed with a bottle of ketchup, I run up the stairs. I throw my clothes onto the evergrowing pile and collapse onto my bed, balancing my pizza on my knees as I tear a slice. Fuck, do I have a pizza cutter up here? I aren’t going back down to make small talk with Kirsten before sheepishly running off with the pizza cutter that she no doubt bought. I load up the TV before I take my first bite. Working from home tomorrow. Lusicous. And then it’s the weekend and I’m going out with Teddy. He didn’t mention where he wanted to go for dinner afterwards. Where he picks will be a big decision for him. If he wants a quick bite, do I ghost him? I start to think of all the bad situations as to why he would he even want to bring me to a west end show in the first place. Did he buy these tickets for another girl and she’s flaked? 

Stop thinking stupid thoughts and eat, I snap at myself. I take the first bite and it’s too hot, I wretch the food in my mouth, take a slug of water to make the whole thing a congeeling mess while it cools down. Netflix never has anything good on it anymore, does it? 

The algorithm has spent years learning about who I am and it still doesn’t have a clue. I’m presented with the top 10 choices in the UK, all sentimental garbage which I scroll past. Then more romcoms, I don’t watch that many, do I? and then more big budget action films that I’d rather watch paint dry than. It’s only when the Disturbing Case of Ali Bass comes up then I shudder and drop the pizza out of my hand. Another one? Really?

I never watched true crime documentaries - despite everyone else my age watching them religiously. Everybody is a sleuth, a crime scene expert, pointing out the obvious flaws in the case that no doubt the detectives had too but just couldn’t prove. I’d watched the Zodiac Killer one, and the Hollywood film, because Katie had said it’d be good for me and she said she had enjoyed it. It was good, to be fair. California was so far away, wasn’t it? And it happened so long ago. You can’t feel anything when you’re that removed from the case. When I was a kid, my Mum and Dad had watched loads. Which was wrong. Their therapists had said that it might be a good coping mechanism, something to help them comes to terms with the frightening horrors of everyday existence. That was a long time ago. I couldn’t imagine that being the way to navigate trauma in this snowflake of a world. 

Another Ali Bass one? What’s this - the fifteenth one? I don’t even think it was the only one released this year. What is it about little Ali that everyone seems to be so fascinated by? I could guess. Well, I say guess. It’s obvious, isn’t it? I’m sure you know why everyone is obsessed with the Ali Bass case. He did it, didn’t he?

It’s hard being Ariana Bass sometimes. Even people at work knew who I really was. I don’t know how because I didn’t tell them. Jennifer, one of the gossips who’d left a long time ago, had come up to me once while I was pouring boiling water in my mug.

“I hope you don’t mind me asking this. And please don’t feel the need to admit it, if I’m right. And if I’m wrong, please don’t feel the need to correct me. I’m not sure how to ask this. I’m not sure if I should. But…are you *the* Ariana Bass?”

Why had she phrased it like that? So long and drawn out. Everyone who asked me always did it it like that. Like I was a celebrity everybody knew to be standoffish and would swear and kick up a fuss if they asked for a picture. People asked me in bars, coffee shops, on the fucking Tube. I can’t remember what I’d said to Jennifer. I think I nodded. Or told her to fuck off. You can’t go to HR after being told to fuck off after a question like that. *The* Ariana Bass. I’m not a fucking popstar.

You’re probably all on the edge of your seats wondering why I’ve got a *the* in front of my name. It’s not all the time, really it isn’t. It’s only sometimes but even then it’s too much. And they’re all usually weirdos anyway so its not like being properly famous where fit guys and famous people come up to you. I wonder if anyone famous does know me and I could watch a concert from backstage? Why is backstage so good anyway? You can’t see the performer. 

I’m the much younger sister of Ali Bass. Yeah, can you believe it? And before you ask, not one penny of this documentary money goes to me. It goes to my Mum and Dad, which is fair because I wasn’t even alive during the tragedy and they were and still aren’t right after it. I was the saviour baby, the Jesus Christ, the last chance stab at a dwindling marriage which had been hounded and bombarded by CSI, private investigators, tabloids, mainstream journals and then all these true crime docuseries production companies. 

Dad does some part time thing for a gallery now I think. He used to be a good artist but he can’t be arsed anymore. He used to do it professionally before Ali died. His inspiration died with her. Mum doesn’t work. They make enough money from these stories to live in decent parts of London, living relatively middle class lives. They’re much more recognisable then I am so they couldn’t go settle down into a little office space and grind away the hours like I do. 

The Disturbing Case of Ali Bass. It’s not even a good title, is it? It’s clickbait. It is disturbing, they’re right, but it’s not flashy enough for me. What ever happened to a little bit of fucking mystique. I hated them all, of course. *When The Light Flickers* was a better title. To be honest, that was a good one. They showed that one at Cannes and it won a load of awards. Mum and Dad went to the premiere and everything, answered questions and cried on camera. I don’t even know what the title meant until about five years ago when I was sat with Dad on the couch and we were channel surfing and it was on Sky Documentaries and I turned and asked him. I’m not sure why I asked him because I never, ever, as a rule, spoke about Ali. 

“The dodgy streetlight out there,” he’d said, waving his arm in the direction as if that would allow me to spot exactly what he meant. “That’s where they found her.”

How awful right? Before you ask, yes, I am a replacement baby. Isn’t that terrible and tragic? I know everyone thinks it. Maybe I am the reincarnated Ali Bass? We don’t look anything alike but what does that mean when she died at four years old? It’s freeing, actually. I dread to think the level of expectation that would’ve been placed upon her shoulders as a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, bubbly little girl. All I had to do was stay alive and I was onto a winner.

I don’t eat my crusts. I leave them cascading on top of each other, gnawing off the remnants of the tomato base while I hover over the play button. Automatically, the trailer starts to show. And I watch. I watch my Dad on screen, so much younger, so much sadder. I see my parents cry and my big sister as a baby. Big sister? Was she my big sister?

I’m not watching this shite. I can’t bring myself to. 

I find my laptop and google the name of the docuseries. 52% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. What is the point anymore? The audience don’t want it. Or do they? 

*Nothing new here* says one of the reviews. *Old footage rehashed* says another. Is anybody surprised? *We need to find Harry Winks* another says. *We need to hear his side of this.* This review isn’t fitting with the other scathing reviews. Fuck off Ben Armitage from the New York Times. Just fuck off. Harry Winks is probably dead, I reason. He must’ve killed himself. Could he live through the guilt? I click on the image of Ben Armitage and read his other arts reviews for the New York Times. He comments snootily on made-for-TV trash. What a way to make a living. I find his LinkedIn and scroll down. I’m logged into mine, though I never use it, but I hope he gets a notification that Ariana Bass is scrolling through his profile, eyeing him up with hatred. Harry Winks is the last person anybody needs to see. My god though. If someone did manage to get ahold of him. What a scoop!

I’d spent my teenage years drowning out my existentialism with Nirvana and other SubPop bands. I didn’t like them when they went major. My Mum and Dad were at the boiling point of their marriage which would lead to a length court battle where they forced me to choose who to live with. In the end, I chose my Dad. He didn’t talk to the press as much, if you can believe they hounded us for so many years. Nineteen years after Ali’s death, in my fifteenth year of age, people still speaking to us, asking the same questions over and over again. Harry’s name came up a lot. “What would you say to Harry if he was here?” 

Harry Winks was my sister’s killer. That isn’t an outrageous take. It’s the public opinion of everybody but the jury that saw him innocent. Nobody knows where he is now. You can’t just go back home after a trial like that. The government were forced to take care of him. He, despite thorough investigation by the press and myself on my laptop before the internet was as good as it is now, had a new life. It was very unlikely he was in the country anymore. This was before Brexit - he was probably in Armenia by now. Harry Winks was the UK’s OJ Simpson. His DNA was found on her clothes. Her DNA was found in the back of his van. The van was spotted on CCTV parked about a quarter of a mile from the house where my Dad still lived. 

Harry Winks had been a stand-up businessman in our town. He organised charity events, had captained the local rugby team in his youth, and owned a factory that employed the better part of the town. He was the reason so many aimless, young men didn’t have to commute into London. They built parts for railways, or something pointless and stupid like that which you never thought to start a business yourself doing but those people always were the richest. He’d come from money, some but not a lot, and was a figurehead of where we lived. My Mum and Dad had never heard of him but that didn’t matter because a lot of people did. Is that why he was found innocent? He had an alibi, several middle managers of his swear he was out at the Old Dusty, a pub in the centre, with them all night. He was apparently so drunk he wouldn’t have been able to drive that van and the defence had ran with the notion that it had been stolen - an unhappy former employee had done this in spite. Who would try to abduct a little girl from her sleeping bed out of spite? 

Harry hadn’t been completely successful though. She must’ve woken, screamed and he’d killed her before he could go any further with her. In a state of sheer panic, he abandoned her by the streetlight opposite the house where a dogwalker found her in the morning. Out on the street. For the whole town to see. 

The trailer shows his face and I turn it off. Some of the edgier documentaries, which only got shown on YouTube, went down the conspiracy route that my Mum and Dad did it. Luckily, we didn’t have to spend too much time on that avenue before they got Harry Wink’s van speeding off six minutes after the coroner had said she died. I’d seen that before on the JonBenet Ramsay one, one I’d watched over and over again as a teenager.

I’ve grown up now and I can’t stomach them anymore. Am I going in the opposite direction? I find some juice by my desk, my computer monitors flickering in the background that they’re disconnected from a source, and go into the bathroom and fill myself a glass. It’s been a while since I’ve thought about Ali. I want it to be a little while longer until I do again.
