If I’d known what I would have come to encounter when I pulled up for that cigarette, I’d have given up smoking right then and there. 



The man was unlike anyone I’d met before. I’m a guard-up type of guy. I don’t much like small talk, I’m polite to strangers, but I keep to myself.

  


Yet, I found myself all too willing to divulge anything to him; it felt like he’d read my book already. He knew all there was to know; *he knew more than I did.*

  


He’d just posed me a question, if you recall. He’d suggested we might be able to make a last-minute amendment to the deal Carl and I had made all those years ago. I knew that what was happening was wrong; I knew I shouldn’t entertain this conversation – for all I knew, this man was here to kill me on Carl’s behalf. 

  


But, he wasn’t, I knew deep down that he wasn’t. I knew from the moment his hand touched my shoulder that this man was here to offer me an opportunity to save my life; I knew he was my ticket to safety. Like iI said; *it was like I knew him.*

  


“Can you…” I couldn’t quite find my question, again; he could see that. He gave me a moment to catch my thoughts before saying, “I can’t undo a deal, a deal is done.” That toothy grin from earlier resurfaced. It makes me queasy to think about it, but at the time, I felt comforted. 



"What I can do is work out a renegotiation of the terms, *if you’re interested?”*

  


*I was interested*, “So, I have to kill Carl? A soul for a soul? Is that it? I can’t do that.” The words coming out of my mouth weren’t ones that I had chosen, but they were true. 



His grin somehow grew, highlighting his rounded cheeks. “That is certainly an option, think of it this way,” I didn’t know what was to come, but anchored to the floor, I listened like my life depended on it. It did. 



“We’ve a bed made up for you, Jimmy. Someone’s got to fill it.” I lowered my head - anything but that. 



“We have a few choices; you and I can re-write this contract right now, change the name and save your life. Of course, there are additional terms here,” there was clearly a big part of this man who was enjoying my turmoil.   
  


“Terms? I have to kill the person myself?” I knew that if this was the only option, today was my last day. I couldn’t in good conscience live out the rest of my days knowing that I’d made this decision.  
  


“Yes, terms. No, not exactly.” his grin had become more subdued. Looking back, it was much more harrowing than the Cheshire cat smile from earlier. This certainly had a sinister undertone and it was palpable at this point. Still, I couldn’t look away, I couldn’t leave. I didn’t want to. 



“I don’t understand?” He knew this already, I don’t know why I bothered.



“You choose from a list of three; once you write the name of your choice in place of yours on this contract,” he waved it in front of my face, I didn’t realise that he’d even taken it from me. There was something different about it, now, though. 



It wasn’t the red scrawl added by Carl to mark the date of my death; it was my sixteen-year-old self’s poorly penned full name. The date remained, but my name was gone. 



“A list of three?” I held my breath awaiting his answer. What were the chances that he was about to name three of the worst people in the world? A couple of those death-row prisoners that have done unspeakable things, grifty political heathens or war criminals? 



*”Natalie, Sarah, or Carl.”*



There was nothing that I could do to stop the floodgates holding back my tears, and I began to sob.   
  


“Have another cigarette, Jimmy. We have options.” I nodded, picked a straight from my packet, put it between my lips and searched through my pockets to find my lighter, before I’d had a chance even to check my last pocket, the man took my cigarette from my lips, put it in his and blew like he was trying to blow bubbles through my Marlboro. 

  


When he blew, the cigarette *lit up.*  
  


As he kept blowing, the cigarette’s ember blazed red, and the smoke began to rise. He inhaled, removed the cigarette from his mouth and then exhaled out of his nose before placing it back between my lips for me to smoke. 

  


“Jimmy, what I’m offering you here is your life back. Not as you know it— there will be some… alterations, but you will see your daughter grow up.” I could feel my head nodding, like I was agreeing with the man. 

  


“If you don’t wish to choose one of the three to take your place, we have two choices. The first is to accept and succumb, accept your deal with Carl and await the outcome.” My nano-nodding turning into an exaggerated shake.

  


“The second is that you take my place, here.” The man stared into my watery eyes. I could feel his gaze infecting my brain as if he could read my thoughts. 



Which was good, given my total inability to speak at this time.

  


“This is by no means an unprecedented offer. I’m a busy man, and I can’t spend all of my time making deals and amending contracts. You understand, I’m sure.” Again, I nodded like I understood – *I had no idea what was happening.*

  


“I don’t- I don’t understand, I’m sorry.” I truly was sorry; I couldn’t concentrate on his words, yet they were the only thing occupying my focus.

  


“I know you don’t, but you will. To save yourself and the three you hold dearly, I am willing to afford you an opportunity.” He reached into the breast pocket of his immaculate suit and withdrew an entirely new document, which he kept in his hand.



“Become one of my… agents. A sort of arbiter, a negotiator, if you will,” I tried to look at the document in his hand, but his next words made my eyes flit immediately upward and lock on his.

  


“You’ll be here, at the crossroads. When a damned soul comes seeking a way out — they always do — you’ll be here, waiting. With the pre-approved amendments.”  
  


“Here, Jimmy. Have another cigarette. Have a read of my proposal. We've got a few minutes left before midnight.” This time, he was already holding one, he performed his party trick once again and lit my cigarette without a flame in sight. 

  


I hadn’t thought about the time; he was right. I looked at my watch; it was 11:49 pm. The deadline, my **’Date of DEATH’,** was now eleven minutes away, six hundred and sixty seconds and counting. 

  


I didn’t have much of a choice; we shared a brief moment of eye contact as he passed the document to me. 

  


It read; 

  


*’*Assisted Termination Agreement - Amendment’ 

  


‘(My Full Name), To amend the prior agreement made with (Carl’s Full Name) on the -date-, you must accept the position of Arbiter of the Rosedale Crossroads.’

3. Your place amongst the damned will be reinstated with prejudice.
4. Any protections afforded are to be revoked immediately.’ 

  
  


‘Signed by:____________ in acceptance with amended terms.’

  


‘Effective immediately.’**

  


“Sir, if I sign this, Sarah, Natalie, Me and Carl all get to keep living? As normal?” I asked him, as if anything could ever feel normal again.

  


“They all get to continue their lives unaffected; your life will obviously be quite significantly altered, but it will indeed continue.” His arm outstretched toward me with a pen he’d pulled from the same pocket the document once called home.

  


I took the pen from his hand. I was hesitant for a moment but I caught a glimpse of my watch, I’d taken six and a half minutes already. I didn’t have time for hesitation. 





“Well, okay then." I sighed, "I’ll sign.” My words triggered whatever it was hiding behind that mask of stoic patience — something deep and malevolent that caused that explosive grin to appear again at once.

  


“That would have been my choice, I’m not sure how you boys finalised your agreement all of those years ago,” he said, stepping forward, “but I find a handshake to be a perfect close.” 





He extended his hand toward me, prompting me to bite the bullet and sign on the line.

  


Reluctantly but with little time left and no other viable option, I pressed my palm into his. It was instant, the agony. I’ve experienced my fair share of pain in my life, but this was nothing like any pain I’ve felt before. 

  


To describe the pain as some a kind of ‘burn’ or ‘branding’ simply does not even begin to explain the sensation that I felt that night, for a moment, I thought I was dying. The heat came not from the man’s hand, but from inside my own. Like the deal, *I had been altered.*

  


Upon the retraction of the man’s hand, the sensation began to calm until it settled as the most intense burn I could imagine. As I looked at my hand to assess the damage, it was there.

  


It was a mark, yes — but my skin hadn’t seared and there were no ashy remnants; it was a perfectly circular emblem, no bigger than a coin. In the centre of the circle was the crossroad symbol that you’d see on a highway sign. The pain hadn’t disappeared; only faded to a moderately less severe pain, but I couldn’t draw my attention away from the man for too long.

  


“You’ll know when you need to be here.” He nodded with intent at the now pulsating emblem that had become a part of my skin, “and when it is time, I expect you to close deals in the same manner - palm to palm.” I looked down at my hand before his words commanded my focus, *“It’s imperative.”*

  


I had no intention of disobeying him. 

  


“Of course.” I nodded, this time I was in total agreement; I wasn’t sure how my life would look from this day forward, but I was truly grateful to be leaving with my life and without having to sacrifice another’s. 

  


“Can I offer you a parting gift, Jimmy?” He smiled that first cold smile, mask intact. 





“No strings attached.” As his gaze lingered interlocked with my own, he opened his hand to reveal a last cigarette before performing his lighting trick for a third and final time.





“I’d appreciate it, Sir.” I smiled as he handed me the cigarette, I placed it between my lips and half-whispered *“Thank you.”* 

  


“No, *thank you*, Jimmy.” Turning on his heel and walking toward the shadows cast by a nearby group of trees; he turned to give me one last grin, followed by a wave which I dutifully returned. With that, he kept on toward the shadows before vanishing entirely. 





I smoked my cigarette where he left me for a moment before moving to a squat, and then a sit. I felt I deserved a sit-down. 

  


As I placed my cigarette-free hand on my head, I felt the raw pulsing radiating from my new emblem. I looked at it, watching it glow for a moment before the document in my hand, previously my amended agreement, suddenly demanded my attention as it had before. 

  


My agreement was gone, this was a document that I’d never seen before. I didn’t know the people named on it, I didn’t really understand the faux legalese that it was littered with, it wasn’t mine. 

  


As I began to read what was in my hand, I was interrupted by the glaring headlights of the first car I’d seen all night, followed by the rapid, intensifying pulsating radiating through my arm from my emblem, I now understood. 

  


As the lost soul hopped out of her car, I approached her and smiled, which she returned hesitantly after a moderate gasp, “Oh, I’m so sorry, Sir. I don’t mean to jump, I’m lost, I need help. Do you have a lighter?” 




I felt my own smile explode, my cheeks contorting in a way I hadn’t felt before, “I do, ma’am, would you like a *cigarette?”*
