I’ve never put much stock into demons or otherworldly evil forces. I wouldn’t call myself spiritual or religious or any other kind of label denoting my belief in something beyond myself and this earthly plane. This world has always been more of a sliding gradient from black to white, oscillating between grey tones. I live my life by way of reason and science. Telling myself there is almost always an explanation. Ultimately to my own detriment.   

Life has not always been kind to me, much like everyone else trapped in this ongoing battle we call consciousness. Suffice it to say I have been feeling rather good lately. I moved into a beautiful townhome in a quiet part of my coastal town and am finally settling in after a few long months of hard work. The pieces are coming together and I feel freer than I ever have before. I am still working on making new friends in my area but I have met some of my neighbors and they are all wonderful people that gush about our community with a fervent passion I find reassuring. Confirming that I made the right choice in coming here.   

There are times since moving in that I have felt watched, preyed upon by something deep in the shadows of my home that I cannot see, making the hair on the back of my neck rise in shivering waves. I chalked this up to having a nearly empty space and being paranoid that I am alone. After all, what human is not afraid of the dark? Does it not ironically cast a harsh light on the fears we humans have of being alone? To be solitary creatures is not in our nature. All this to say I am forever grateful to have my trusty dog by my side.   

My dog is a bit of a velcro dog, my shadow if you will. He is deaf and can almost always be found one step behind me or laying at my feet with a paw or muzzle touching my leg to ensure I am still there. I take great solace in knowing that I am not alone. A woman’s best friend, beside me at all times. Especially when I need it most.  

 These moments came to pass shortly after moving in. My perspective of reason and logic battled with my need to explain away the odd occurrences in my home.   

I always sleep with my door closed. It gives me comfort to know I can shut away the dark recesses of my home and create security within my room. A smaller space in which I alone reign and control. Which is why I found it so puzzling that my door seemed to have a mind of its own.   

For two weeks after move-in I grappled with the mystery of my door opening and closing on its own. I would close my door and settle in for the night, enjoying the dim candles flickering and casting light in a rhythmic dance across my walls. Just as I began to feel soothed and ready for bed my door would pop open with a creak, jolting me from my nightly ritual. I initially talked myself into thinking it must be the wind or air pressure.   

After several nights of this unsettling dance with my door I went to great lengths to ensure it stayed closed. I very purposefully closed my door, leaning my full body weight against it to ensure it locked into place. And then I locked the door with a defiant huff and turned to climb into bed. I took a single step towards my bed when I heard my door pop open with a creak. The creak was abnormally longer than before, as if it were mocking me for even trying to keep it closed.   

I scrambled backwards to my bed as a cold wave washed over my body from head to toe. I looked frantically for my dog and found him snoozing away on my bed, head propped delicately on my pillow, blissfully unaware of my terror. I reached for him in a desperate attempt to feel connected and my door slowly creaked shut.   

I slept with the lights on that night.

Shortly after this occurrence my sister and her girlfriend moved in, much to my relief. My door ceased to act up and I was finally coming to terms that it was mere wind or some other kind of explainable physics that caused it to misbehave.   

One day while taking the trash out I ran into a neighbor I hadn’t met before. He drove up in a large black truck, arm hanging casually out of his lowered window.   

“Hey, you moved into my old place, right?” he asked me, jerking his head in the direction of my townhome.   

“I did, yes!” I replied enthusiastically, beaming a smile.   

He paused, giving me a long, hard look. “How are you liking it?”   

“I’m loving it so far,” I half truthfully said, a brief flicker of fear stirring in my belly at the thought of my door moving of its own volition.   

“Hmm yes. The views are quite spectacular, aren’t they? Can’t beat that sunset,” he said, nodding at me in a peculiar way, as if he wasn’t quite seeing me through his eyes. “I recently moved to a different unit.”   

“Oh. Well in that case I have to thank you for opening up the space.”   

He nodded at me again. “Yeah, yeah. Sure thing. You have a good one.”   

I waved at him as he drove away, feeling my smile slowly fade to be replaced with a deeply unsettling feeling of confusion. I too, brushed this off, grateful to have a roof over my head and a community that was, for the most part, very friendly.

A few months have gone by since that interaction with the former resident of my home. My dog and I have established a comfortable routine. I work from home on central daylight time on the west coast so I finish work pretty early around 3pm and make my rounds to the dog park and community gym. I’ve been taking great steps to improve my mental health and overall well-being. I’m eating right, working out consistently. I even downloaded a dating app to try and start putting myself out there.   

Things have been going swimmingly up until 3 nights ago when I had my first visit. From him. From it. I am still not entirely sure what it was. Only that it has been a pervasive presence ever since.    

I recently returned from vacation to celebrate my sister graduating. I was beyond happy to enjoy family time and take a much-needed break from work. But I’ll admit it felt amazing to sleep in the comfort of my own bed. On my own mattress that I spent a pretty penny to acquire, my dog nestled closely beside me, snoring lightly and twitching from whatever dreamscape captured his sleeping mind.   

The sounds of my TV began to blur as my mind slowed and my eyelids drooped, pushing me to the precipice of consciousness in the waking world. I rubbed my eyes groggily and exited *Queen Charlotte* in favor of my sleepy time show *Avatar the Last Airbender*. Anyone with anxiety will understand the need to have something playing in the background before falling asleep, driving away the doubt-filled voices that whisper nasty shortcomings into the deepest recesses of my mind. I clicked my sleep timer on and rolled over, promptly sinking into the all-encompassing arms of REM sleep.   

I woke slowly in the middle of the night, still grasping at the remnants of a dream long gone. It wasn’t an unpleasant dream from what I remembered so I settled back down and closed my eyes, struggling to reclaim the dream that had been lost. And that’s when I heard it.   

A deep, rumbling growl sounded in my ear, vibrating throughout my entire being. And then ever so slowly, a very male hand snaked its way around my neck. Tightening like a vice and releasing before fully cutting off my access to air. I could feel the grooves of his fingers digging into my skin as he dragged his hand purposely down my chest and settled at the base of my sternum. Pressing there, as if to hold me down. I felt the possessiveness in that touch. Tasted the fear, hot and metallic in my mouth.   

This thing. I could sense its intentions. It didn't want to kill me. More like stake a claim to my very being and root itself deep inside so that I might tear myself apart trying to escape it. I tried desperately to lift an arm and push this thing off me. But I was paralyzed to my very core. So, I waited, trembling against the unforgiving weight placed by those brutal fingers upon my chest.   

I cracked my eyes open and the presence dissipated immediately, leaving me breathless and near hysterics. As I tentatively sat up, I scanned the room with shaky eyes, looking for something that I knew was not there. My dog was in a deep sleep at my feet and I cringed thinking, *What kind of guard dog are you?*   

The pressure at my neck lingered. I could still feel the shape of his fingers pressing into me, locked around my neck like a collar, binding me to my fear. On wobbly legs I made my way to the bathroom, phone flashlight in hand and nearly jumped out of my skin when I caught my own gaunt reflection in the mirror. With haunted eyes I examined my neck and what I found ripped the air straight from my lungs.   

Deep, finger-like shadows had imprinted themselves upon my throat. A large indentation where his palm took possession of my neck. My breath came in rapid succession, one after the other. I nearly dropped my phone as I struggled to flip the light on and fell to the ground, back pushed up against my cabinet, the knob digging roughly into my back. The pain was enough to ground me momentarily.   

I gave myself a minute before rising from the floor and slowly dragging myself back to my room. I switched on all the lights in my room and clambered back into bed, pulling my dog up close to my chest. He woke up and began to wag his stubby tail, tongue lolling out to the side as he grinned widely at me, head thrown back. Breathing out shakily, I told myself it was just sleep paralysis. I woke on my back and I don’t typically sleep that way. That must be why.   

My fingers grazed the spot on my neck where he held me prisoner, still feeling the ghost of pressure printed upon my skin. I did not sleep the rest of the night.

My roommate is not a religious person but she has experience blessing her grandma’s house with sage. I eagerly waited for her to wake, palo santo gripped tightly in one hand, lighter in the other. She emerged from her room after what seemed like a millennia and I accosted her at the fridge. I frantically asked her to bless our home, waving the palo santo around with what I’m sure was a mad look in my eyes.   

“Ummm sure dude, of course. Everything alright?” she asked, concern taking place upon her face.   

“I-I’m not entirely sure. I think I just experienced sleep paralysis. But it was unlike anything I’ve had before. I’ve never been touched by my paralysis demons in the past. Let alone growled at,” I stammered, eyes glued to the palo santo digging into my hands, knuckles white with terror.   

As I explained she nodded along, visibly disturbed by my waking nightmare. No, she had not experienced sleep paralysis before. Yes, that’s probably more than likely what had happened. There’s no such thing as demons, right? We conversed as she made her way around our home, gently waving the palo santo up and around to every corner, leaving no space untouched by its delicate, woodsy scent.   

Feeling a bit lighter I went to my bathroom and stared in the mirror, no shadow imprints marred my neck and I breathed out heavily, relief taking hold. I proceeded to wash my face, turning this way and that to further confirm what I could not believe happened earlier that morning. My dog whined loudly at my hip, slowly backing away, ears tucked low. I frowned at him, rolling my eyes and thinking, *Everything is fine now*, before turning back to the mirror.     

A saccharin smile that was not my own possessed my face, sharply curling at the edges. A murky whisper of a presence lurked deep within my eyes. Something dark and nameless had taken hold upon my soul, gently caressing me. Whispering that I’ll never be alone.
