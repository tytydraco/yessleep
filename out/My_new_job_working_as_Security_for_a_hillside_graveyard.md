Triple the pay. That’s why I’m here. My degree in business administration might land me a desk job drowning in spreadsheets for fifty grand a year. This? Guarding Town Memorial pays three times that. Easy money, they said. Quiet nights, they promised. My friends think I’m morbid. My family worries. They don’t get it. After years of grinding for scraps, I feel like I’ve earned this silent, lucrative peace.

My gear’s simple: a battery-guzzling flashlight, a worn baton that feels like a toy, and a uniform the color of stale mustard. My predecessor, Derek, clocked out just as I arrived. He’s pushing seventy, maybe older, moving with the stiff caution of someone who’s seen too many winters – and too many nights here. His eyes, pale and washed-out, scanned the sinking sun before landing on me.

"Shift starts now," he grunted, voice like gravel underfoot. "Rule one: You don’t interact. Mourners, visitors… they do their business, you do yours. See nothing, hear nothing. Just walk the paths." He paused, his gaze drifting towards the massive, ancient Banyan tree dominating the lower slope. "Especially down there. Just… walk." With a final, unreadable look, he shuffled towards the gate, leaving me alone as the daylight bled away.

The guard station sits atop the central hill, offering a panoramic view. By day, Town is almost picturesque – rolling slopes dotted with weathered stones and marble angels catching the light. By night? It transforms. Darkness swallows the hillside whole. Sparse, aging streetlights cast feeble, disconnected islands of jaundiced yellow on the paths, making the shadows between them feel thicker, hungrier. My plan to nap dissolved instantly, replaced by a low thrum of anxiety in my chest.

Patrols are mandatory. Twice a night. One before 3 AM, one after. The route snakes down crumbling stone stairs to the Banyan tree, then loops around the base of the hill to the older, neglected section on the far side. A ten-minute walk, max. It felt like a death march that first night. Tonight was no better.

As I started down the stairs, flanked by silent ranks of granite and marble, the beam of my flashlight felt pathetically small. Angels wept stone tears. Cherubs stared with vacant eyes. Crosses cast long, distorted shadows that seemed to twitch at the edge of the light. Every step crunched unnaturally loud on the gravel. Every flicker in the darkness made my breath hitch. My brain, a traitor in the silence, conjured horrors in every gap between the tombstones. That’s all it is, I told myself. Just the brain filling voids. But the conviction felt thin.

The Banyan tree loomed ahead, a monstrous tangle of roots and branches that swallowed the light. Its presence always dragged up the memory, sharp and cold: New Year's Eve, years ago. Midnight fireworks exploding like cannon fire, illuminating the night in staccato bursts. Laughing, running forbidden through the graves with friends. Then, the next blinding flash… the ragged shape swinging from the Banyan’s thick limb. An old woman in a nightdress, turning slowly. Our screams swallowed by the next explosion. The frantic run for adults, met only with furious scolding – never go into the graveyard after midnight. And we never heard about them finding her, either.

A cold sweat broke out on my neck. As if summoned by the memory, the streetlight near the tree’s base flickered erratically. I forced my feet forward, aiming the light towards the cluster of older graves huddled in the tree’s oppressive shadow.

That’s when I heard it.

Sobbing. Soft, broken, utterly wretched. A woman’s cries.

I froze, heart hammering against my ribs. The sound seemed to come from just beyond the nearest row of headstones. I swept the flashlight beam. Nothing. The sobbing hitched, then seemed to drift… behind me, further up the path I’d just come down. I spun, light slicing through the gloom. Empty stairs, empty graves. The sound wept again, now seemingly to my left, near a moss-covered obelisk.

"See nothing, hear nothing." Derek’s words echoed uselessly. Panic started a low buzz in my ears. My job was to patrol. To walk. Teeth clenched, I pushed forward towards the Banyan, the source of my childhood nightmare and the apparent epicenter of this spectral grief.

My light finally pierced the deepest shadows under the tree’s canopy. And there she was.

Kneeling before a weather-stained granite slab, her back to me. Long, white hair spilled over the shoulders of a thin, pale nightgown. Her frame shuddered with each silent sob I could no longer hear. The tombstone she faced was clearly visible in my trembling beam: MELISSA BLUNT. Beloved Grandmother. 1958-2001.

Air fled my lungs. I tried to speak, to utter some semblance of professional inquiry – "Ma’am? The cemetery is closed…" – but my throat seized, producing only a dry click. This was wrong. So profoundly wrong. The silence around her was absolute, thick as the grave dirt itself.

Then, the sobbing started again.

Not from the figure.

From directly behind me. Close enough to feel the phantom breath on my neck.

Pure, animal terror detonated in my skull. I didn’t think. I ran. I scrambled back up the stairs, flashlight beam jolting wildly, illuminating fleeting glimpses of leering stone faces. I didn’t look back. I burst into the guard station, slammed the door, and locked it, my back pressed against the cool plexiglass as I gasped for air.

Logic tried to reassert itself. Stress hallucination. Overactive imagination fueled by the memory and the dark. I fumbled for my phone, fingers numb, pulling up mindless videos – puppies, kittens, anything bright and alive and normal. The frantic rhythm of my heart began to slow, the buzz in my ears fading slightly. Maybe Derek was right. See nothing. Hear nothing. Just get through the shift. I still had the second patrol… but that could wait. God, it could wait forever.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

The sound was soft, polite almost. On the fogging plexiglass window of the station door.

I jerked my head up. Outside, haloed by the weak station light, stood a little girl. She couldn’t have been more than ten or eleven. Her skin was unnaturally pale, like porcelain under moonlight. Her eyes were large, dark, and utterly depthless. She wore a simple, clean dress. There was no visible sign of harm, no overt menace… just a profound, unsettling stillness. She raised a small, pale hand and tapped the glass again.

Tap. Tap.

Swallowing the lump of ice in my throat, I forced myself to slide open the visitor log slot. "Y-yes? Can I help you?" My voice sounded strangled.

The girl stared at me, her expression blank. When she spoke, her voice was a flat, emotionless monotone, devoid of the sobbing’s anguish but chilling in its certainty.

"I am coming to visit a family member." A small, cold hand gestured vaguely towards the lower slopes, towards the Banyan tree. "Please write it down."

She paused, those dark eyes fixing on mine.

"My name is Melissa Blunt."

The pen felt like frozen lead in my hand. The logbook page blurred. I heard Derek’s gravelly voice, thick with unspoken dread: "You don’t interact." But she was waiting. Pale. Still. Her name hanging in the cold night air like a tombstone inscription.

Melissa Blunt. Deciding not to write down the name, I realized I still have to patrol the other side before 3.

Writing this down so that I will learn something from my experiences, or someone else may be able to make use of it.
