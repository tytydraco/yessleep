The day after I turned 7 years old, my dad tried to explain cancer to me.

Mom would have done it—I know she wanted to. I think she was too afraid that she’d break down crying and scare me, though. The goal was to make things seem as normal as possible. To not let me see the grown ups flinch.

Dad though; he could always smile through the worst of times. No matter how dire the situation, he always found a way to keep it up. Just this soft, warm grin that could calm storms and set pounding hearts at ease. My dad smiled so much that I’m almost certain some people thought it was a façade; a presentation to give the impression that he was fine, and so was everything else. It wasn’t though. Somehow, he just managed to wring enough good out of any situation to still find the strength.

He wasn’t smiling that day he told me, though, and that scared me more than anything.

He may not have been smiling, but he wasn’t frowning either. He was plain. A vacant, plain expression that almost stared through me as my tiny figure stood before him.

Finally, unable to take the unease any longer, I softly muttered, “Dad?”

That was enough to pull him back down to earth, and also bring that signature grin back to his face, if only for a moment.

Only for a moment…

He opened his arms as he sat on the couch and nodded to me, “Come here, Henny. Come sit on my lap.”

The return of his usual demeanor emboldened me, and I crossed my arms with a bratty huff. I had just turned seven, and I was a big girl now. I didn’t sit on my dad's lap anymore, and I made sure to tell him all of this.

Dad just chuckled and insisted, saying, “That may be, but you’re still a little girl to *me.* You won’t be forever, though, and someday I won’t be able to hold you anymore.” He leaned in close and scowled his eyes playfully, “Then, you’re going to regret not getting all the hugs you could have.”

My seven-year-old brain weighed his words carefully, and ultimately decided that the idea of one day not getting my father's world famous snuggles was, in fact, more terrifying than not being a ‘big girl’.

I hobbled over to him, to which he scooped me into his arms, setting me on his knee and holding me tightly from behind. His breathing was shaky and exhausted, and I could tell he was too, as he lulled back against the sofa.

After a pause that lasted far too long, he shakily said, “Your mama is sick, Henny.”

I didn’t know what he meant by that. I was confused why he was bothering to tell me; mom got sick all the time—we all did. Still, I had enough sense even then to gauge from his voice that it was much more serious than that.

All I could think to say was, “Is she okay?”

Dad kissed my head, and I could hear a slight rasp to his voice as he told me, “Well, not quite. She’s really sick this time. Not the kind of sick that you get when you have to stay home from school.”

“What kind of sick is it?”

“It’s um… It’s called cancer.”

You know, it’s funny. When you’re a kid and you don’t know the meaning of a word, they always sound so harmless. No weight or danger attached to them. To me, cancer was just a word that I sometimes heard adults use. It was always in hushed whispers, or followed by a slew of apologies and pity sounds, but I didn’t know why. I remember I thought it sounded fun, like ‘dancer’.

It wasn’t until I heard my dad say it in that aching voice, and in a context involving mom, that it fully hit me how bad it was.

“What is that?” I asked quietly, folding my chin into his forearms, as if they’d protect me from this new, scary monster.

“Well, it’s… It’s a real bad sickness. A sickness that hurts people.”

“How does it hurt people?”

Dad didn’t answer at first, thinking of how to put it best, “You see your skin?” he began, tapping my arm with a finger, “That, and all the stuff under it is made of tiny little living things called cells.”

That concept blew my mind, and I turned to my dad in mortified disbelief, “My skin is alive?”

Dad couldn’t help but chuckle, “Sort of. Why don’t you imagine your body as a big factory, and the cells are the little workers inside that keep you nice and healthy.”

I stared at my arm in wonder, but didn’t interrupt.

Dad’s tone turned back to a more solemn one, and he cleared his throat, “Those cells get old though, and need to replace each other eventually, so they make more. Sometimes, a bad one sneaks in.”

“Cancer?” I mumbled softly.

Dad nodded, “Cancer cells get confused. Instead of helping the body, they start to attack it. They make the factory start to shut down, and if too many of them get made, then well… it does.”

My stomach felt sick at that, even though I don’t think I understood the weight of it. That was evidenced by my next sentence, “Is there medicine we can give her to make her better?”

Dad took a deep breath, then lifted me up, spinning me around on his lap to face him. Looking me in the eyes, he did his best to not break, “Cancer is confusing, Henny. It’s like those snakes you try to catch in the garden; slippery and hard to pin down. The doctors have different ways to try and find it to get it out, but it also hurts the person who has it.”

“So it would hurt mama?”

Dad didn’t respond, he just brushed a hand through my hair, “Mama’s strong. She’ll be okay. But it’s going to take a long time for her to heal. She has a lot of those bad cells in her body.”

“How did she get so many?”

I could feel dad shrug his arms, “I don’t know. Sometimes they just happen.”

“How?”

“I don’t know.”

“Why did she not feel them sooner?”

“Well, we just didn’t…” dad started before something hit him hard. His voice broke, and he pulled in a breath that was shaky, trying to hold back a sob, “I don’t know.”

I had so many questions still. Kids are notorious for that. We could ask ‘why’ to everything until all the knowledge in the universe was imparted to us, then still find one more to toss in. But like I said, seeing my father upset scared me, so I shut up and sat still in his lap, silently looking at the ground in thought while he buried his neck into my hair and gently wet it with tears.

“Hensley?” Hope called over her shoulder, looking back at me and shining my phone light. We’ve been together long enough now that I more than trusted her with it.

I had spaced out and stopped moving during a walk to the vending machines. We’d finally run out of food, and since we’ve been a lot more physical lately moving bodies, we were burning through it much faster. We were heading there with an intent to finally smash it open and take everything inside, but I’d got lost in thought the moment my eyes met with the glowing parking lot of the play place just down the road.

*Zanes Jammin’ Jungle.*

“You okay?” Hope's smile faltered.

“Yeah—sorry, just…”

Her eyes traced my own, then she frowned and nodded her head toward the motel, “Come on, let’s keep moving. We’re about due for a creature soon.”

I nodded, then joined her side before continuing down the road.

“I don’t get it,” she said as we moved, her eyes also now focused on the sinister fragment of the past, “Why that place? I’ve barely even thought about it since we were kids.”

“Well, that’s another difference between us, I guess,” I sighed under my breath.

“Fond birthday?” she asked.

“No. But the day after sticks in my mind pretty well.”

Hope shamefully looked at the sidewalk and didn’t respond, clearly feeling dumb for not putting two and two together.

I winced a little to myself, awkwardly fidgeting with my oversized coat sleeves. Since her arrival, Hope had been working double time to keep the spirits high for both of us, and I hadn’t exactly been pulling my weight. If anything, I’d been infecting her with my negativity.

Trying to cheer her up, I bumped her shoulder with mine, “You’re probably right, though. Mom would have wanted the birthday to be what stuck more.”

She smiled only faintly, but her eyes at least drew back up. She spoke a few moments later, “Hey, Hen… what am I?”

The question caught me off guard, but admittedly, it was to be expected, eventually. Since we’d met, it’d always been on our minds, there had just been far more important issues at hand that we needed to sort out first.

Now, in the dead space of routines, we finally had our moment.

You’d think with all that time to think, I’d have come up with a better response than, “Oh, um, well, you’re me, aren’t you? I thought we already knew that.”

“No, I know, but… *what* am I?” She snickered softly, “Like, we look the same and talk the same and have all the same memories, but we clearly don’t think the same. I should have made that connection too about Zane’s, it was an important moment in my life just as much as yours. Is it… bad that it didn’t even come to mind?”

“Hope, what?” I said, feeling guilt in my stomach for spiraling her down this hole, “No; you’re fine—you’re, um, great.”

She gave me a look that told me she didn’t believe my words.

“Listen, that day after our party was obviously not a good one, and you’re the much more optimistic of us two. Of course your mind wouldn’t have gone to the dark place like mine did.”

“Okay, but what does that make me, then?”

“I don’t know,” I tossed my hands up with a chuckle, trying to find the right words to diffuse her concern, “I mean, you came from me. Like, literally *came out* of my body. Maybe that means you’re just another part of myself. This place clearly is making imprints of bits and pieces from people's lives, you’re probably just a fragment of who we are.” Realizing that didn’t sound the most flattering, I turned to her and sincerely added, “Clearly all the best parts of me.”

That was enough to make her smile, then shake her head, “Shut up. You’re fine, Hen. If I came out of you, then that means everything I am is just as much you as me.”

I snickered, “Yeah. Sure. That’s why I’m *so* much fun to be around.”

“You’re *fine,*” Hope reiterated before falling back to silence. It took her a beat to work up the courage for her next question, “So… what happens when we get out of here?”

I swallowed, then said, “Huh, what do you mean?”

I knew exactly what she meant.

She clearly sensed my nerves, “D-Don’t worry; I’m not, like, panicked about it or anything. There’s a good chance when we leave I might just like… stop existing? I guess that’s best-case scenario.

“Hope, that’s not best case…” I told her. “You’re a person too, now.”

She turned to me and made a joke that honestly surprised me coming from her, “It’s fine, Hen. We’ve come to terms with dying a long time ago, right?”

I frowned, but couldn’t find words to retaliate with before she spoke again.

“But if that doesn’t happen then, like… what then? You’re just going to have another you walking around, and that might get complicated.”

“Great. Just what the world needs: more of me,” I joked half heartedly.

 “Hensley… I’m serious.” Hope prodded, “I won’t have any legal identity; I couldn’t just go off and make a life of my own very easily. And besides there's—”

She started to say something else, but quickly cut it off.

I wasn’t about to let it slide, “What? There’s what?”

“Nothing. I guess we don’t really need to get into it right now…”

“Hope,” I continued digging.

She sighed and threw her head back, almost looking guilty for her next words. She hugged herself and spoke, “I don’t know—I guess there’s just everyone else? Like, I’m you, Hen. I still love our family and friends and… and Trevor. It would just suck to leave him, but… we can’t both be in the picture.”

I stared at her with my mouth parted slightly, a sick feeling heavy in my stomach. “Hope, let’s… Not worry about that right now. We’ll figure it out when we get out of here.” I moved and hesitantly placed a hand on my clone's shoulder, “They’re going to love you just as much as me. If we proved to them what happened and that you’re really me, they would never turn you away.” Trying to lighten things, I added, “Plus, I don’t think Trevor would mind having two of the woman he loves around.”

It got a snicker from her, but she shook her head, “Eh, he’s not like that. He’d still want only you. You’re right, though. I guess we should figure this out once we get out.”

“N-No, we can talk about it if you want, I was just—”

“Seriously, it’s okay, Hen!” Hope smiled bright and far too convincingly, “One step at a time here.”

We finally arrived at the machines right as our conversation finished, and though I was still worried about Hope, I didn’t want to push things, so I turned back to the task at hand. I was a little confused when I did, however.

“Alright, you ready to break these suckers open?” she questioned.

“Hang on, that’s not right…” I muttered.

“What? What’s up?”

“These rows were empty last time I was here,” I explained, pointing to a lane of chips, “I cleaned it all out; bought their whole stock. Why are they back?”

Hope furrowed her brow, “Are you sure?”

“Dead sure. The weird thing is, that one has a new kind of chips,” I said, tapping on the glass.

“Is it… being restocked?”

I snorted, “Yeah, the regular maintenance man of the abyss is stopping by to make sure.”

Hope shot me a glare, then elaborated, “I *mean* maybe through some other means, dummy. The imprint map has these listed as a research site; maybe they’re special somehow.”

“Maybe *they*’*re* imprints of some kind.” I ventured.

“Elaborate, please.”

“Well, there’s the giant building from our childhood that showed up here,” I started turning and pointing to it in the distance, “So obviously things from the past can show up here. Like an imprint.”

“Right,” Hope nodded.

“I’ve been thinking about the bodies lately and how they’re singing and talking. They sound like recordings of different life events. That first one we found said ‘I love you’ to somebody who said it back, then romantic music started playing, remember? Then there was that um… unsettling one where—”

“No! Nope. We don’t need to talk about that.” Hope said pressing her hand to her ears.

We’d found a corpse recently that wasn’t spouting random phrases or songs like the others, although to call it a corpse might be an overstatement. When we arrived at its location in a small hardware store, it was merely a vile, sticky, rotting puddle on the floor, filled with bone and hair and bits of flesh.  The only identifiable things left were small digits like fingers and toes and a single ear floating in the gore.

We almost left it and just went to a different one, but the dots on the map were already getting thin the more we ticked them off one by one, and the hatch meter was still not even a quarter of the way full. We couldn’t afford to pass any up, and besides, we already had a set method to sweeping the town, so we decided not to change things up now.

We grabbed some respirator masks from a shelf of the store (something we honestly should have done a long time ago) then some snowplow shovels before heading back to the body. Hope and I ‘rock-paper-scissored’ for who got one job, and I ended up losing, making me have to shovel the goo up while she held the trash bag open. It was all either of us had not to puke at the crackling noise of flesh peeling from the floor, but that quickly became the least disturbing thing.

As we disrupted the body, it began to wake up. They usually don’t start making noise until Hope and I begin jostling them around, but this one did nearly instantly. It sounded foggy and warbled, as if the means by which it spoke was broken.

“No… no, no, God please! Please!”

There was the frantic sound of shoes pounding across the concrete floor, but then I heard an abrupt slamming noise, and the man let out a grunt. There was more sounds filling the space with him, something moving toward him.

Something that sounded like cracking bones and snapping branches as it moved. I could hear whispers filling the air along with them.

 The man let out some more desperate pleas for help and cries for mercy in a voice so primal and filled with fear that my body locked up in horror.

“No! No, no, no—please! Please I—”

*CRUNCH.*

The noise was sharp and sudden. One loud clap of something crushing the man in the flash of an instant. I could hear him gurgle and gasp in surprise, but it wasn’t over.

*CRUNCH, CLOMP.*

It sounded like two massive boards of wood being pounded together with the man inside. I could hear his bones and flesh being ground up and pummeled to paste as it happened, and all the while he tried to make more sounds. My head spun and felt nauseous as I thought I heard him attempt to call out for his mother, but it only came out in an incoherent gurgle that nobody would hear. Then, finally—

*CRUNCH.*

And the memory was over.

But that’s not how the bodies here work; they don’t just stop then go silent. They ramble over and over and over again until we throw them down the chute. Normally, they have multiple memories and sounds that they cycle through, but whatever happened to that man, it had to have been so horrifying that it was only part of him that could stain into this place.

It was the only thing that played until we got the body to the hatch.

The worst part was that it didn’t even fill the imprint gauge at all. All we got was a brand new fear.

That wasn’t the only case of that, however. The same exact thing happened when we went back to retrieve Juarez’s legs. The same memory of something with stiff, cracking joints and menacing whispers that follows its wake. His wasn’t nearly as bad as the puddle, only the sound of the tower skylight smashing then shaking breath. One clap of it cleaving his body in two, and then the memory was over.

That one hadn’t stuck in Hope’s head as much because Juarez at least seemed to have some other happier memories that balanced out the horror as we walked him to the hatch. Both cases certainly stuck in mine, however.

You may have already put two and two together, but that creature? The one that I heard in both those dead man tales? It was the same one I dreamed about. The same thing that I heard in my last post.

Once I realized that, I went back and reread the notes that we’d found. I couldn’t sleep that night and needed to make sure I wasn’t just inflating things in my mind. Unfortunately, I wasn’t.

In Brand's letter, they mentioned the creature that killed their team coming back up to the shelf with its ‘Maddening whispers and clattering bones’. It’s a perfect match.

I don’t think Hope has put those two things together, and I don’t have the heart to tell her that whatever killed those two people is what’s coming back eventually to kill us. And whatever it is, it’s so horrifying that Brand took an easier way out just to avoid it, and Juarez let it take him because he thought he deserved it more than hell.

I’m more terrified now than ever. We need to get out of this place.

Anyway, all of this is to say that I’d begun forming theories of the shelf based on the bodies.

“What if this place is like one big notebook or something?” I asked her, “Like, everything that has been here or passed through leaves a mark on it somehow.”

“That’s not a bad theory…” Hope answered, “And maybe it’s like, the harder you press, the more you leave behind? Like leaving grooves on the sheet behind the first one.”

“Yeah, exactly,” I nodded, “Maybe we’ve been here so long that that’s why Zane’s popped up.”

Hope placed a hand to her chin, “Maybe. But if that’s the case, then why does it seem like the scientists here didn’t have any real effect on the area. They must have been here a while.”

“While, some equipment is broken. Maybe they had a way to control it or monitor it?”

“Yeah, I guess that makes sense.” Hope nodded, turning back to the vending machine, “But back to the matter at hand, how does that involve the chips?”

“Maybe the stuff that imprints here isn’t just after it enters. This town exists in the real world; I know because I drove through it before I started getting pulled into this place. Maybe this is part of the town outside that’s getting recorded in here too?”

Hope smiled, “Man, you’ve really been working at this, huh?”

I scoffed and looked at my reflection in the snack machine glass, “Yeah, well, none of that is for certain. It’s all just guesses based on what we have so far.”

“I think it’s good enough for now; it makes enough sense at least!” Hope said, patting my back, “So where does that leave us with these, then? We probably shouldn’t smash them, right?”

“Why not?” I asked.

“Well, what if it breaks that imprint?” Hope questioned, “Right now, we have infinite food so long as we keep using it the way you did the first time. If we’re here for much longer, we might need that. And besides, if we don’t make it out of here, and somebody else gets stuck, then… Well, it would be nice to pay it forward, you know?”

“That’s awfully thoughtful of you,” I told her with a sarcastic smirk.

“Well, we gotta look at this from all angles,” she sighed darkly before starting for the motel office doors.

“Where are you going?”

“To take out some cash,” she called over her shoulder with an amused grin.

Her idea was good; there was a decent stack of cash in the rundown register. We couldn’t use a lot of the big bills on the machine, unfortunately, but there was enough 1’s and 5’s to get us stocked back up.

As I worked the bills and keypad on the machine, Hope kept watch on the tower, making sure that the light didn’t click on. I even bought some drinks this time so that we wouldn’t have to only keep drinking this places putrid water. We were nearing the end of our grocery shopping when something else caught our attention, however. We noticed it in the silence of me entering a new keypad combo.

Music filling the air; loud, but distant. We both looked over our shoulder toward the direction it was coming from.

Zane’s Jammin’ Jungle.

There was a jumpy, 60’s style rock tune blaring through speakers within that leaked through its walls and into the town. For as unsettling as the silence here had been, it was almost more eerie to hear noise coming from somewhere we weren’t occupying. We were the only ones here, after all.

I looked to the tower light. Still off.

“The power still works in there…” hope noted.

“Makes sense. The parking lot is on, too. The building looks like it’s safe from this place's rot as well.”

“Even so, who started the music?”

I thought for a moment, listening hard to the tune. It was familiar. Somewhat nostalgic. I’d heard it before, long, long ago.

“There’s that animatronic band,” I said, “They would always play every hour on the hour. Maybe it’s on a timer.”

“Yeah,” Hope nodded, “That tracks.”

I finished grabbing out the chips that had dropped while we were gawking and handed them to Hope, “Ready to call it for today?”

She crammed them into her pack, then slung it on, “Yeah. All this body upkeep is really taxing, mentally, and physically.”

A little bit after we got back to the station, the light to the tower finally clicked on. Just in time, I suppose. The beast came from the top of the cliffs this time, something we learned recently could happen. It seems that even above us isn’t safe. We’re truly surrounded down here.

Hope and I paid little mind to it as it began moving through town on its hunt, however. It was quiet, thankfully, and we’ve gotten a lot more comfortable moving around the radio tower while beasts are in town. Whatever shield they put on this place, it stops things from even getting past the sidewalk to the building, so we figured we probably don’t need to hunch under desks for hours on end anymore.

We still hide if things get too close, though. Can’t be too careless.

The two of us went up to the main room to update our map. It’s much more bearable to be up there now that the scent has had time to air out. I’m still working out trying to fix machines in my free time, but not making much progress. This is high-tech lab equipment vs. a random girl from California, so, obviously you can tell how that match is going. I’m not giving up, though. I’m still seeing all of your comments listed on my posts, and I know that there’s gotta be something valuable that I’m missing by not seeing them.

Hope and I reached the imprint map then looked down at it with disappointed frowns. The dots were already wearing very thin, only a couple dozen left, and the meter by the machine by the door wasn’t even close to being filled up. The problem was, Hope and I didn’t even know what filling it would do, and even if we did get the door open and got to ‘the drill’, we didn’t know how much energy we’d need to power it. If it was a full tank, we were screwed, and considering that we were trying to punch a hole out of a hellish dimension, I’m guessing that’s the case.

Hope keeps trying to keep spirits high, though, “That’s okay. Some of these might be worth more than others. That one in that yellow house was worth quite a bit.”

Even I couldn’t entertain her this time, “Hope… we need more.”

She bit her cheek and kept her eyes glued to the map, “Well, once we get them all, we can pivot to trying to get the door open. We can probably get some more clarity inside.”

I sighed and leaned against the console to force myself in her view, “Listen, I know you’re scared, but you’re not dumb, Hope. There’s nothing left out here; we would have found it by now.”

I pressed a finger to the rig 1 icon without looking.

“We have to go into Zane’s. It’s clearly another place where these people were set up; there has to be clues in there. Maybe there’s a password to the laptop or something—that’s gotta have all the information we need.”

Hope put on a desperate face, “I know, Hen, but we don’t know what’s in there. There’s no protection like this tower. If we go in there and you die—”

“Then fine,” I cut her off, a little frustration growing inside me, “We’re probably going to die anyway, so I don’t exactly see the harm in doing it early. We have to do something, though; I don’t see why you’re so concerned if I live or croak, considering that’s a given, even if we get out of here.”

I fully expected her to raise her voice in return; it’s certainly what I would have done. Hope really is the better half of me, though, “I care if you die because you need to make it home. Dad and Trevor are waiting on you. That place is just too convenient—too real. Like it’s *trying* to lure you in. We can’t trust this place.”

I couldn’t stop my anger from growing more, and my next words slipped out on pure impulse, “Oh really? Well, technically, *you* came from this place, so how do I know I can trust *you*? You seem like you’re trying awfully hard to keep me from making any real progress.”

The look of hurt on my own face made me internally wince, but it somehow hurt more that hope still didn’t lash back. She just sadly muttered, “I-I’m not trying to… I just wanted to…”

I wanted immediately to comfort her. To say that I was sorry and that I didn’t mean that. I’ve been told that I’m stubborn at the worst of times, though, and my impulsive coldness always has a way of getting the better of me. I simply couldn’t force anything out.

“Maybe you’re right,” Hope pitifully said, attempting to pull up a weak smile, “Let’s just… talk about this later? I’m going to go lay down. I’m tired.”

Finally, I broke from my binds but it was too late, “Hope, I didn’t mean—”

“No, it’s okay! Really,” she quickly reassured, moving backward for the door, clearly eager to escape, “shouldn’t be putting anything off the table. We need to take risks if we’re going to make it out of here.”

I once again found I couldn’t respond, which only led to a very awkward, painful silence as Hope lay her hand on the doorknob and waited for a response. When I didn’t give one, she just nodded with a smile, then exited.

Immediately, I let out a huff of frustration, then buried my hands into my face. Meanwhile, the beast on the shelf with us let out a strange, machine gun sounding cackle. Clearly, it found my suffering funny.

It took me a while before I left the tower room, then headed back downstairs, but I didn’t reenter the offices. It’s strange; when I first got here, I would have killed to have company, but now that I’d spent every waking moment with Hope the last few weeks, I suddenly found the desire to be alone.

It was less rooted in selfishness than it was self-loathing, however. I needed to be alone to stew with myself.

I hated that I was like that. So easy to snap and vicious when there was resistance before me. Hope had been nothing but kind and helpful since she arrived and even solved several things about this place already. She didn’t need to be put on blast by the pitiful little bitch who only whines and complains. I really was the queen of that. Always have been. And then what did I do after I’d lash out and make people feel like shit?

Go sulk and stew like I was doing right now.

A consuming cycle. A horrible beast worse than the ones outside that I let devour me more and more each time I did it. Maybe it had already eaten me whole. After all, that was why I was here. One long, two week self-pity party on the road, pushing everyone I cared and loved away because I couldn’t handle the way *I’d* acted back home.

I missed Trevor. I missed dad. I missed my other friends, even though I hadn’t reached out in months. Why couldn’t I just be Hope? Where was she all that time she was inside of me? The kind, sweet version of me that never angered or got upset?

Maybe she was right about Zane’s. I have a tendency to be reckless; was this just another excuse for me to barrel into something blind again?

The more I thought about it, the more I knew it couldn’t be, though. If I was at least right about one thing, it had to be that. She had a point about it being too perfect, but that was the exact reason we had to go in there. This place wanted me to. It was like it wasn’t going to let us progress unless I played by its rules.

From a more literal standpoint, it also made logical sense. The rigs were clearly designed to harvest something; probably for the drill. If there were clues on how it worked and how to operate the machine, they were in there.

My brain continued running logistics until it eventually fell back to the emotional. Hope had raised a great question; why Zane’s? The day was great for me as a kid, but it wasn’t anything special. I hardly remembered any details about it at all. If anything, shouldn’t something have appeared that mirrored the following day like I’d said? The much more impactful one.

As I dwelled on it, I couldn’t help but fall back into the memory. Sitting there with Dad. We’d sat there for a long time after he stopped talking. He held me, and I just awkwardly sat there like kids do, hugging him back but not quite understanding his emotions. I knew he was sad, but I didn’t realize then he was crushed.

No, my mind had been elsewhere. In the young, naïve questions about such affairs. This cancer thing, was it going to make Mom throw up a bunch like I did when I got sick? Dad said that if enough bad cells got in, the factory ‘shut down’, but how does a body just ‘stop working’? That didn’t make any sense to me. As far as I knew from movies, you had to get hit really hard or stabbed for you body to die.

I remember one question in specific that felt important enough to ask, “Dad, can you get cancer too?” my voice barely above a mumble.

“Hm?” he asked, lifting his head from my hair.

“Can mama give you cancer too?”

Dad smiled and squeezed me tight, “No, don’t worry, Henny. Cancer isn’t a sickness like that.  It’s not contagious. We’ll be just fine, you and me.”

I remember the way he said that so vividly. Filled with so much warmth and reassurance. I had been feeling sick and uneasy that whole time, since the moment he told me Mom was sick, but in that one instant, if only for a moment, he chased it all away. He had a way of doing that a lot throughout Mom’s decline. Easing the waters when they got too stormy.

As I grew up, I began to realize that his words weren’t concrete. Just because he said it in a way that calmed me down didn’t mean he was going to be right. I never held it against him, though, when things didn’t pan out well. Eventually, I just learned to appreciate that he was keeping his head up through the pain, and trying to do the same for me.

If Hope really is part of me, she’s gotta be everything that Dad taught me.

My phone was in my hand without me even realizing, contacts open and hovering over the first voicemail from my dad. Just like with Trevor, I was terrified to hear it, but I just needed his voice.

Tears were already falling before I tapped play.

“Hey, Henny,” he said, a smile hidden in his tone. His voice was old and worn now, not like that day when I was 7 years old. Still, he talked with just as much warmth. “I, um, hear you’re out on the road. I hope you’re being safe.”

There was a long pause filled by the crackle of the phone's mic, my dad’s breathing and the silence between them.

“Trent, um, told me, Henny. About the diagnosis. P-Please don’t be mad at him; he was just worried about you since you’ve… well, you’ve been gone.”

I could hear his smile give way to tears, his voice a hoarse crackle.

“Listen, sweetie, you can talk to me always, okay? *Always*. I know you’re probably scared and confused and going through a lot right now. I know why you’d probably want to be out on that road alone, but… you aren’t going to find anything out there, Hen. I promise. Only a lot of loneliness and just more questions about yourself that you can’t answer.”

I shut my eyes tightly and gritted my teeth. Why hadn’t I just checked my phone. Just one time on that damn trip?

“Why don’t you come on home, okay?” Dad asked, smile back behind his words, “Come home, and we’ll work through this together. I love you, my little Hen.”

“I love you too, Dad…” I whispered softly.

Then voicemail ended.

I let my phone fall to my lap, curling into myself as I let more soft sobs slip out of me. My joints ached in that position, and the muscles through my body burned and stabbed. I felt tired and fatigued.

My dad had a lot to explain that day he told me about cancer. It’s such an awful, complicated thing that it’d be impossible to cover it all in one sitting, especially to a little girl. He didn’t have time to explain chemotherapy in depth. He didn’t have time to warn me about all the awful things it does to a person and their body all in an attempt to uproot the thing slowly infecting your insides. He didn’t have time to tell me about the different types of cancer that can appear in all the different places. The brain, the lungs, the skin.

In the bones.

He didn’t tell me about the way it can spread to different parts of the body, and that there were stages to it. That if you didn’t catch it soon enough, and if it had already spread too far, it might already be too late to stop it.

And the one thing that my dad didn’t explain to me when he told me that cancer wasn’t contagious was that there was a thing called heredities. He didn’t tell me that cancers, although rare, have a chance of passing down from parent to child.

Like I said, though, I didn’t hold it against him when things didn’t pan out.

I nearly jumped out of my skin when I felt the couch sink next to me, and a pair of arms wrap my shoulders.

“Sorry,” Hope muttered, “I didn’t mean to scare you.”

“It’s okay,” I chuckled, wiping my eyes, “how long have you been here?”

“Long enough,” she told me.

I nodded, then caught my breath before speaking again, “I trust you, Hope. I didn’t mean that earlier.”

“I know,” She smiled, “I’m you, remember? I know how we can be sometimes.”

I snickered, then sat up, to which Hope leaned over fully, resting on my shoulder, “You were right, though. We need to go in there.”

I nodded, but it was weak, “You were right too. It’s probably going to be dangerous. Maybe a trap.”

“Well, whatever it is, we’ll make it through.” Hope told me, her eyes looking down at my phone, “We have to for them.”

I nodded, then we both fell to silence, just taking a moment to rest before the impending storm.

“I think I’ve figured out the answer to your question earlier. The one about why Zane’s is so important.” I eventually spoke.

“Why’s that?” she asked softly.

“I think that was the last day of my life that I remember being happy.”

Hope didn’t say anything in response. She didn’t agree or deny the words. She just hugged me tighter as my tears started up again, and we both sat there together through the night.

This is probably going to be my last update before we go into Zane’s. If I don’t post again soon, then… well, you can probably assume the worst. Don’t worry, though; I don’t intend on that being the case. Even if it does go down that way—if I don’t end up making it back out of that building from my youth—don’t mourn for me, okay? It was probably inevitable.

And besides, at least I’ll be going down with a friend. That’s more than others who died here can say.
