CW: Contains scenes of kidnapping and abuse.

You don’t get to decide how your life changes. Not really, anyway.

You can’t plan or prepare for it. One minute, everything feels normal, almost boring, and then, in an instant, it’s gone. Just like that, your world, your safety, and the sense of control you thought you had, all vanish into thin air.

My name is Emily. I’m writing this because I don’t want anyone else to fall into the same trap I did. It seems that you can’t show any compassion anymore, or else it ends up biting you. I know I’m supposed to be thankful that I made it out alive, and I am. But sometimes every part of me feels like I’m still back there, stuck in that place. I need to get this off my chest, and more importantly, out of my mind. Who knows, maybe my story will help somebody out there.

Don’t think you’re safe just because it’s a nice day, or because you're walking in a familiar neighborhood. That’s how it always starts. If you’ve watched enough crime documentaries as I have, you know they begin with something small, something so unremarkable that it almost feels weird to call it the beginning. I was too naïve to see it at the time, and that nearly cost me my life.

It was a typical Thursday in eastern Virginia. I had been working my ass off trying to finish my online degree, so I thought I would get out and take a walk across town. I figured the fresh air would do me some good.

That afternoon felt calm and ordinary, just like any other day. I admired the first signs of fall beginning to show along the path. Sunlight warmed the cracked pavement while red and orange leaves drifted down, crunching under my steps. My mind wandered, free from any concern. I started to think about what I wanted to do for dinner. I thought about making something simple, like pasta, or even picking up a pizza. There was no rush. The town was quiet and still, the silence broken only by the occasional hum of a leaf blower in the crisp autumn air.

I wasn’t on alert. I didn’t think I needed to be. Looking back, I still wonder if things would’ve turned out differently if I had been walking by that spot five minutes earlier or later. Perhaps things would have turned out differently, and I wouldn’t be sharing this story with you.

I almost stopped at the corner store for a soda, but kept walking, telling myself I didn’t need the empty calories. As I moved on, the warm scent of cinnamon filled the air, followed by something else. The smell was so tantalizing that it immediately piqued my curiosity. Glancing over the fence that separated the store from the yard behind it, I spotted the source of the wonderful smell. It was Mrs. Landry’s house. There, on the windowsill of her kitchen, sat three perfectly crafted pies, each releasing the mouthwatering scent of apples and spice. I closed my eyes, letting the fragrance wash over me, and for a moment, I thought to myself that this could nearly be the perfect day.

It wasn’t just close to it. It was perfect, until I heard the hum of a car approaching from behind me. I didn’t think much of it at first. I figured it was just another car passing by, likely another stranger in a hurry, probably heading home from work or squeezing in a few errands before dark. Just as I had pushed it to the back of my mind, I heard the engine ease back. The brakes gave a sharp, brief screech as the car slowed to a near-stop beside me.

I should’ve just kept walking, pretending I hadn’t noticed. Instead, I stopped and turned as the car came to a final, sharp halt next to me.

The car didn’t look like much at first, just a beat-up old sedan from the late ’90s or early 2000s. It was the kind you stop noticing after seeing a thousand of them. But the longer I looked, the stranger and more out of place it felt. The fading gray paint was chipped and scabbed over with rust, worn down by years of neglect. A fresh dent marred the front bumper, sharp and out of place, as if it had struck something recently.

The windows were tinted just enough to hide whoever was inside, though the driver’s side was slightly cracked open, as if the air within had grown too thick for them to breathe. The tires were mismatched and worn nearly bald, yet somehow still holding together under the car’s weight. The headlights were dim, emitting a sickly yellow glow that flickered every few seconds, like they were struggling to stay lit. Even the engine sputtered unevenly, with each dying cough sounding like it was fighting for its last breath.

As I studied the strange car, the passenger window suddenly jerked to life, grinding and squealing as it inched its way down. It finally came to a stop, leaving a narrow opening into the dark, stale interior. From the shadowed gap, the upper half of the driver slowly came into view.

Curious as to what they wanted, I hesitantly leaned toward the cracked window, trying to get a look at the person behind the wheel. A dark silhouette of a man emerged, leaning toward me across the passenger’s seat. From the looks of him, I guessed that he was a middle-aged man, maybe forty or fifty, with long, greasy black hair slicked back across his scalp, like he hadn’t washed in months. His face was gaunt and unnervingly pale, as if he hadn’t stepped into sunlight in years. His skin looked almost artificial, like Halloween makeup left on for way too long.

He tilted his head downward, his gaze dropping until our eyes met. Up until that moment, I hadn’t been especially cautious, but the instant I looked into his eyes, fear struck me like a hammer on cold steel. They weren’t dark or light, but more so empty. Strangely vacant, like they shouldn’t belong to a real person.

He stared at me, wide-eyed and unblinking, studying me as intensely as I was him. After a few agonizing seconds, he smiled. This seemingly friendly gesture unnerved me even more. It wasn’t the kind of polite smile you’d give a stranger you just met on the street. It was too wide. Too eager.

His lips curled around his face, stretching so far that it seemed they might tear at the corners, stopping just short of it. It was as if he was trying to mask something behind the bizarre display. Something that he didn’t want me to see.

“You need a ride?” he asked, his voice smooth, almost pleasant.

If it weren’t for how sharp my senses had become, I might’ve considered him to be a nice guy just trying to help me out, but something about him put me on edge. I could physically feel my skin crawling under my jacket. The sound of his voice. The way his mouth moved when he spoke. The car he drove. It all screamed danger in my head, but I foolishly gave him the benefit of the doubt.

I hesitated for a moment. It wasn’t like me talking to strangers, let alone getting into a car with one. Something about that moment held me in place. I was speechless, but my mind wouldn’t slow down. It felt like I was stuck in a bubble with this guy, and though I couldn’t name the feeling, it clawed at me deep from within my gut, telling me something was wrong here.

“No,” I said quickly, shaking my head, hoping that would be enough.

He didn’t move. He just kept staring at me, smile never faltering.

“You sure?” he asked. “I’m not going that far. Just a little drive. I can take you wherever you need to go on the way.”

I could feel my heart thundering in my chest. There was something so fundamentally and disturbingly wrong with this situation that I had begun to plead with myself to leave. Why I chose to continue standing there will forever haunt and confuse me.

One part of my brain clung to caution, urging me to run or get away in whatever way possible. The other part, the curious side, was unfortunately the one winning the battle. My feet remained glued to the sidewalk, and I just stood there, staring back at his lifeless eyes.

I should’ve run or done something, but I just stood there. Instead of doing the obvious thing, I chose to respond to him.

“No, I’m fine. Really.” I said, my voice cracked with nervousness.

His bizarre grin fell for the briefest moment, as if he were disappointed, but quickly returned before I could even blink, stretching even wider as if he were forcing it.

“Come on,” he pressed. “I’m not a bad guy. It’ll just be a short ride. No harm in it. You look like you could use a break anyhow.”

There was a part of me, a part that I hate now, that felt compelled to respond. As stupid as it sounds, it insisted that I remain polite, as if I owed him an answer.

Swallowing my growing fear, I spoke.

“I’m fine,” I said again, trying my best to make my voice as confident and intimidating as I could… though inside, I was anything but.

I took a step backward, my feet moving almost instinctually.

He didn’t flinch from my act. He just sat there with his eyes locked onto mine. It felt like I was caught in a staring contest, the stakes of which were getting higher by the second.

For a moment, a deafening silence settled between us, only broken by the soft click of the passenger door unlocking. It was barely louder than a whisper, but it was enough to send me into pure panic. My heart jumped in my chest, and my body froze solidly in place.

The door creaked open as he pushed it outward, revealing the torn, ragged seat inside.

“Please,” he said softly, his voice unnervingly calm, “I just want to help you.”

It was like he was trying to coax a frightened animal into approaching him, pressing ever-so gently, seeing what he could get away with.

Looking back, I could strangle myself for not just running away, or yelling, or doing something other than standing there. Instead, I decided to do something I had never done before and haven’t done again since. I chose to stand my ground, hoping that seeing me push back would deter him.

I took another step back, trying to slow my spinning mind. My breathing quickened, and my hands began to tremble as I planted myself on the sidewalk. I had seen this type of stuff in TV shows, but I never thought I would ever have to live it.

My resolve crumbled in an instant, replaced by suffocating panic. One moment, I was telling myself to stand my ground, but it was quickly washed away by my overwhelming instinct telling me to run. I quickly turned, tensing my calves for a push-off down the street. I planned to run as fast as I could, yelling as loudly as I could until I reached the corner store, where I knew I would be safe. Before I could make another move, I heard his voice tear through the air, booming in my ears.

“Don’t make me chase you!” he snarled with gritted teeth.

He now stood outside his car, staring at me with the cold focus of a predator daring its prey to run.

I froze, my brain stifling any urge I had to move. Time seemed to slow down dramatically. Seconds felt like hours as his words swirled around my mind. The looming threat of what would happen to me if I tried to run held me firmly in place.

Maybe it was the fear, or the way his words clung to my mind, but I couldn’t move. I forced myself to look into his eyes again, desperately searching for some small glint of weakness, anything to assure me that he wasn’t going to hurt me. What I saw instead made my stomach turn. This wasn’t just a man in a car. He wasn’t just a stranger asking for company. This was something else entirely. There was something in his eyes, something deep that I couldn’t place, but it told me with a chilling certainty I would die if I tried to run.

Before I could even register it, he had lunged around the back of the car and was quickly running toward me. By the time I reacted, he was already stepping onto the sidewalk.

I ran back toward the corner store as fast as I could. I could hear his shoes slapping the pavement as he chased me, gaining on me with each frantic step. I opened my mouth to scream, but before I could get a sound out, his hand shot out in front of me, covering my nose and mouth with a thick, white rag. A sharp, chemical smell filled my nose, stinging my sinuses.

I tried to pull away, but his hands held it tightly to my face.

“Let go of me!” I shouted, my voice muffled to nearly nothing by the rag.

I kicked and thrashed, but his grip was like iron. His fingers dug into my ribs and arms, and his body pressed against me as he yanked me backwards, dragging me down the street and shoving me into the passenger seat.

“You’re going to be fine,” he whispered in my ear, his breath hot against my neck. “I’m going to take you to a safe place.”

The thick, noxious scent flooded my throat, choking me from the inside out. I tried to fight it with everything I had, knowing that if he got me into the car, I was done for. Though I gave everything I had, my muscles betrayed me, losing strength almost immediately as he pushed me onto the seat.

The next few moments were a blur. My vision spun around me like a vortex, faster and faster, until everything began to tilt and dim. The world shrank to fragments, slowly retreating, giving way to blackness. I could feel his ragged, eager breathing on my neck as the sound of the car’s dying engine filled my ears, followed by the echoing thud of the passenger door closing behind him. The dark shape of his face hovered above mine, grinning down on me as my vision faded further.

My eyes rolled back, barely holding focus. I caught a glimpse of something metallic in his hand as my head rolled around the headrest. The world smeared into streaks, blurring into a mixture of light and dark. I tried with everything I had left to push myself away, but the darkness rushed up too fast, pulling me down with it.

As my vision fell to black, I felt cold, sharp metal pushing into my throat.

“Go to sleep now. I don’t need any surprises.” He said, his words warbling in my ears as my body finally gave in to a deep, paralyzing sleep.
