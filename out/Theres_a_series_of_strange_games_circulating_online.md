*CORRIDOR GAME :DOOR OF OPPORTUNITIES*

I'm losing my sanity, day by day it's slipping from my grasp and I don't know how to stop it and it's all because of that stupid game! That fuckin corridor game. Here's the thing, some words might be jumbled up but I'm writing as I recall.

Last week my girlfriend and I hit a bit of a snag. Well I found out she was cheating on me with her boyfriend and I was the side piece without knowing and get this, the guy thought I was her gay best friend. So I had it a brick wall emotionally and I was in a bit of a loss. My mind was just wavering, I'm not a person to do drugs, I just deal with situations head on and hope for the best. But this right here ruined me, I was losing sleep, scrolling the internet for anything to distract me. That's when I stumbled upon a thread of "Supernatural games" you can play. I read through it and a bunch of it was some made up shit or shit that required too much effort. I needed something with minimal effort something I can do at home you know.

*Corridor Game: Door of opportunities*

*Steps : Fine an apartment building with corridors.*
*2: Wait for 02:02 am to play.*
*3: Knock 3 times and say I open the doors of opportunities to our world.*
*4: Do not let the door close*

I shrugged, rolling my eyes in disbelief on how silly this sound. But I lived in an apartment building so where's the harm in trying it. The clock read 22:45, I just had to wait it out a bit.

Now here's the thing I live in door number 24, each side has 10 doors the walls in the corridor are peach with red doors and the numbers are in gold metal. On the other end there's an elevator on the other end there's stairs that descend or ascend depending on how you wanna go.

At 02:02 I was outside standing at my door. I took deep breaths and then three knocks "I open the doors of opportunities to our world", all of a sudden my room became chilly, just a small breeze enough to make me shiver for a moment. Then I opened the door, "Ohh Lord", my mind was blown, the corridor that's usually brightly lit had dim hanging bulbs, swinging side to side with too little light to illuminate the whole corridor. I took careful steps looking around, the walls were still the same just the paint was fading, claw marks on the doors and some door numbers dangled from their place.

The atmosphere had shifted, the air smelled stale. I walked towards the elevator trying to take in the view. I reached door 28 and grabbed the handle, then pushed it open. 

It led me to a blank, I can't even say blank because it led me to nothing just a void an opening in space, I reached out with my hand letting the dark engulf it, my whole arm felt non existent. I lost all feeling to the darkness. Tried wiggling my fingers but couldn't so I pulled my arm out. I shut it off and went to another, the floor boards were creaking. Silent whispers from walls that would disappear whenever I look at the direction. 

The room I opened next had a man laying on a bed, a queue of women coming from, I don't even know maybe outside because there like 23 women naked women. I noticed they all had the same face but different body types and colors. The man was sobbing as these women rode him, "Please please no more no more", he begged, they took turns having sex with him. He saw me, he was grunting in agony "Kill me. Please ", he mouthed, and another woman came on top while another stood waiting.  The queue kept getting longer and longer these women seemed to spawn from nowhere... I quickly shut the door. I never seen that man before, I opened another one. 

There was a man barely visible under stacks and stacks of $100 bills. There was so much money he was practically buried under it, only his nose was visible. Whimpers escaped his mouth, mumbling something incoherent . I left that door and opened another one. A woman stood on top of a counter yelling her lungs out, men crawling under her barking like dogs confessing their love, some were carving their skin with knives writing her name and she saw me, "Please Please take me with you please" the men turned to look at me and growled. I went out of that room running, I opened the last door this one made my brain ache. 

There was a man naked, in the middle of the room semen everywhere, the walls the floors the windows he was carrying a picture of, I shit you not it was a picture of Jesus. The room reeked,I had to cover my nose, the floor was wet and the ceiling was dripping.
This man was waving his penis around as he came all over the room, it nearly hit me. He turned around and saw me, there was tears on his eyes "Please make it stop", he kept jerking off and just shooting his jizz everywhere. I had to bolt at that point. During my run I stumbled and went crashing into another door, I found a woman who was surrounded by food so many food, some rotten some still fresh. She was eating, kept eating and eating couldn't stop herself. Tears streaming down her face as she filled her mouth. Her stomach grew, grew, grew until it blew and guts were flying everywhere. Just like that she was back to normal, it was a never ending circle. All of a sudden, I had seen enough I headed back to my room. I opened the door and went to bed.

When morning came I had a migraine, but I had to go to school. Now everyday before I walk out the door I play some music, the distance from my room to the elevator or stair is probably 35 seconds. I walked, I walked and the song played and finished before I even reached the elevator. I figured I might've hit fast forward by mistake. For the next few days I realized the corridor was getting longer and longer.

Everytime I'd walk, it felt like I was walking kilometers. I could see the elevator just few feet away but it'd feel like I'm not even there yet. So I started running just to see if I wasn't overreacting. And to no one's surprise, I wasn't reaching the end. I haven't reached the end I've been stuck in the corridor for what feels like days but my clock is still on 02:02.. I need help. I really really need help. The paint on the walls is fading, melting. The doors started rattling and I'm hearing things, screams and moans. I need help.
