Have you heard of a Quinkan? It's probably not a term you're familiar with. They're spoken about in Australian Aboriginal dreamings. Usually, they're described as mischievous, sometimes even playful spirits. I'm... not so sure. I know what I saw that night. I could never forget it, no matter how hard I've tried to. And what I saw couldn't have been further from the term "playful".

When I was a young fella, my brother and I would often take camping trips out to the river. A little local spot known as "Big Bend". It was usually just myself and my bro, but I remember this one trip my step brother and his girlfriend came along. I vaguely remember parts of this trip, but some stuff stands out. I’ll go over the one notable occurance. That’s what you’re here for, right? The creepy stuff. Well yeah, it definitely was that.

We had been out that way many times and despite it being quite an eerie looking spot, especially at night, it was never something I would describe as "scary". Not up until then. So here we are, myself, my brother and my step brother, we were walking and talking at around midnight or so, and my step brother starts trying to scare us. He was telling us stories of things that supposedly lurked out there in the bush. I remember distinctly, this was the first time I ever heard about the Quinkans. He kept telling us random stories about people who had supposedly seen them. Tales of them stalking campsites or chasing people through the scrub as they were out there, you know, taking care of business. This would be my very first introduction to Aboriginal spirits and beasts.

It wasn’t at that point I got truly scared though, I was more fascinated than anything. I was always into dark and scary things, so these stories simply captivated my imagination rather than freaked me out. It was when we rounded a bend and came into a large clearing, one that housed a very sizeable waterhole that the creepy stuff began. I remember my step brother just stopping on the spot and in an instant, he just turned and bolted off down the road. That gave me and my brother a fright. It wasn’t entirely out of the ordinary though, this bloke was a weirdo and he’d often do random shit like this.

But then we saw what caused him to run. 

Picture this scene... this waterhole, it’s pretty bloody big. And on the far side of it there’s this massive rock wall stretching upwards about 10 meters. During the daylight hours it’s a popular activity for people to climb up the side and jump off into the water. At night thought it’s always deserted. Not tonight though, we see it... and at first it’s just barely discernible shadows. Then we start to make out forms. My brother’s the first to say it, “is that people up there?”, and we both just stared upwards. I saw it too, yep, for sure. Human shaped figures making their way up the rocks off to the side. There’s about 5 or 6 of them, dragging their bodies up the scrub. Not walking, I mean literally dragging themselves up, their arms and legs flailing around as they do so.

As they get to the top, they all kinda line up side by side, still laying their on their guts. But now, their heads and the tops of their torsos are hanging over the edge of the rock wall. That’s bloody dangerous. Yeah, people jump from there, but there’s a certain spot you gotta jump from to clear any rocks beneath. These guys, they’re aiming their heads right towards those rocks and they’re teetering right on the edge.

At this point we yell out “Hey! What are ya doin?! Get down from there ya dickheads! Ya gonna get hurt!”. But they didn’t listen. Instead, in unison, they simply leaned further and further over the rockwall edge, before plummeting downwards.

We watched in horror as these people bounced off the rocks on the way down, before splattering into the waters at the bottom, much of which made for shallow cover over sharp rocks just beneath the surface. There’s no way anyone’s surviving that. We stood there in a state of shock, not knowing what to do. We had just witnessed people die right in front of us.

That horror lasted barely one moment before it was replaced by another. For when we glanced back up to see if we could catch a glimpse of where they ended up, we surely did, but not as we expected. Cold fear gripped us in an instant, as we watched these… things… bobbing up and down in the water, floating, ever so slowly towards us. Their heads straight up in front, with their faces pointed right at us.

It was very clear now we were not looking at human beings. These things were… shadowy, dark… humanoid, yet far from human. Their faces were the dead giveaway, you could barely make out once human features, but the eyes were hollow, as were the mouths that hung open, as they floated through the water, coming ever closer to us.

It’s a strange sensation, being literally frozen in fear. Unless you’ve experiences it you can’t possibly understand it. But in that moment all we could do was stand there in the night, nothing but the splish splash of the water as these things bobbed up and down, ominously surfing their way towards us. It was only when they reached the banks of the waterhole and began dragging their disgusting forms up out of the water, and we got a close up look at their gaping mouths and lanky shadowy limbs that we turned and ran just as my step brother had before.

It was obvious these things were chasing us. As we clambered up the sand banks, making a bee line for the cover of the bush, we would steal glances back to see them practically floating after us. The strange thing was once we hit the bush they just kind of stopped, floating…  kinda dancing around on the sands. Not that we stayed to make sure that’s all they were doing, we absolutely booked it back to camp, packed up our shit and told our step brother that we were leaving.

That was my first and last time to see, what I believe, was a Quinkan. I mean I have no idea what else it could have been. The description fits to a tee. I suppose it could have been something else. Another spirit of the land I’m unaware of. But from the stories my step brother was telling me that night, that’s what it looked like to me.

Let me tell you... they scared me more than any other ghost I’ve ever heard tales of. The oddity of what they were doing, yet, how deliberate they were in their actions. The way they just slowly floated across that water. The way they toppled off the rockwall. None of it made any sense and yet we were very clearly their target. I still don’t know why they were coming for us that night. What their intentions were. 

I hate the thought of those wide, gaping mouths, every time they appear in my nightmares. Yeah, I still have those. People often talk of ghostly encounters with a sense of wonder… of fascination. But let me assure you it’s NOT fun. It’s traumatic. It’s terrifying. And I hope I never see these things again.
