“I love you so much, do you love me? ” She doesn't reply. It means that she’s fallen into a deep slumber because she promised me to reply back if she’s not either asleep or dead . I gently put up a nicotine patch on her back. She *needs* to be addicted to me and it’ll help her relax. She is unable to sleep without me now. It’s good that now she’ll never leave me. Never. I gently get out of the bed and kiss her pretty face.



I tiptoe through the front gate to the garage to my shitty hatchback and gently pick out my spade, go into the backyard and start digging. It was quite unfortunate what happened to Daisy, her dog. The hardest part for me was crying out the fake tears and controlling the laughter when that bitch suffocated to death in front of me. But she doesn't have to know that right? Dogs die, that’s life.



I go to the backyard half dancing. I really want to laugh maniacally but it’ll wake her up so I snicker lightly like a kid who’s stealing cookies from the kitchen cabinet at night. I madly dig up Daisy's little limp body. Around the 5 feet mark I become extremely careful. I don't want to waste precious blood. As I see a little silhouetto of Daisy, my eyes light up under the moonlight. 



The creature will be so happy to drink its blood. **I am a good person.** At first I tried to feed him my own blood. He even loved it. But how much blood can a person lose? The murder of Daisy is my LOVE for it. A stupid dog’s life is more important than it.



She looked so…peaceful. Just lying on the cold grass without a breath in her body and a worry in her lifeless eyes. Death looks so…comfortable



I carefully pick Daisy up and fling her body on the soft green ground. I want to kick it. So bad. But I control myself. It’s bad to harm animals, especially the dead ones and I am a good person. I grab Daisy by her tail. She’s cold. Very cold. I half wanted to use her body as a fur and flesh ball, to go back to the car and slam her into the portable freezer. I can’t believe I store Energy drinks in that.



After filling up her grave I change clothes in my car. I’ve never felt so alive before this. It will be so happy to drink Daisy's blood.I didn’t sleep all night. Who could? 



At around 7 am , I removed the patch from sweetie and tucked it in my jacket. I have to prepare breakfast for my sweetie. It’s bacon day! I wake her up and present bacon and eggs. She’s sad. Then I remember that Daisy died. I had to make a mopey face too but I was bursting with excitement from inside. 



“Baby, I cannot imagine the pain you're going through but you have to stay strong and I am always there for you.When I was 5 years old hundred was the largest number i knew, but now, no number could express the love I have for you” 



She's still moping around. When she's about to cry, I put my finger on her mouth and whisper in her ear “would Daisy want you to cry? Can't you do this little thing for her? You're a strong girl, right?”



She nods in the affirmative and eats the omelet with ketchup. Ugh. Thank God my job taught me some social engineering because I couldn't handle her whining. Your dog died. Grow up. Get another one. Just don't bitch about that bitch. 



I gently wipe the ketchup off her thin lips. It seems a little familiar. I don't know, maybe I'm just paranoid. “I gotta go sweetie.” I can feel her warm breath on my cheeks. It's strangely comfortable 



“Please don't go! I feel so weird without you. You make me feel full…without you I'm empty” 



“That's because you're addicted to nicotine” I whisper to myself thinking how the fuck cannot someone feel weird WITH a weirdo like me. 



“I’ll be back before you know it”

I kiss her on the lips and bid my farewell.



“Newcorp is waiting for their cybersec expert afterall!”, she shouts sarcastically, I blush and get into the shitty hatchback and I'm immediately reminded of the good deed I did yesterday. I am bringing it some food. I begin to think about all the sounds he will make when he drinks Daisy's blood and skin. I don't know why but it never eats bones. Eh, personal choice 



*schlk... schlurp... gnnk..ahh...vlurpp*



While trying to make the sounds it makes when it drinks blood I pick up a tennis ball and throw it in the back seat and scream “FETCH!!!!” Too bad she's dead, she was dyslexic anyways.



I suddenly hear some barking and my soul, or whatever's left of it jumps out of my body. But it's just a random street dog.I scream SON OF A BITCH but that's the truth and continue driving.Thank God. I thought she was resurrected or some shit by the god of rabies to take her revenge. She’s dead…right?



Frantically, I stop the car under a bridge and, in a frenzy, open the freezer… she's just as lifeless as last night but just to make sure, I shake her. HARD. Shit. Do I miss her?

No. I am a good man. A loving man. If I had to, I’d kill Daisy again. I’d kill a hundred other dogs. Maybe even some cats.

For *him*.

Because *h*e is love.
