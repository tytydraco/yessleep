So I guess some simple background, names Dan. I work from home, an accounting firm. Pays good. I enjoy it. But look, this is all going to be very strange but I need to say something.

I’ve lived in **\[̲̅E̲̅\]\[̲̅R̲̅\]\[̲̅O̲̅\]\[̲̅R̲̅\]** for a little over three years now. I moved here because the cost of living in this part of **█░█░█░█** is incredibly low.

The town itself is a totally normal, small town, maybe a couple thousand people or so, more during the summer. It’s one of those forested, lake towns. That people visit for vacations. If I drive five minutes down the road to the grocery store or the local bar, there are people there. I go to the same gym and diner as everyone else. It’s a nice, quiet small town. But the second I turn onto **▓▒▓▒▓▒** Drive, it’s like I’ve crossed a border into a ghost town.

The weird thing is, my neighborhood is finished—dozens of houses—think classic americana, town houses lined up nearly identical, save for some paint colors but I am the only resident. No 'For Sale' signs, no moving trucks, and most importantly, no neighbors. It’s just me and about forty empty houses.

I mean no one. No kids playing in the street. No bonfires at night. No fireworks on the 4th. Never any lights on. It’s so odd. Not a single person in my neighborhood. Even during Halloween no one came to my neighborhood. 

Well sorry, I guess there are ‘people’. The reason I’m posting is because the city maintenance here is so weirdly consistent. Even though no one else is out here. When the grass grows too long, a city crew comes out and mows each yard. A garbage truck comes out every Tuesday and stops at each house, even with my bin being the only one out. Hell, even during winter after it snows a city truck comes and plows every driveway. Even though I never see any other cars.

It’s not like I’m complaining about the service, honestly. My lawn looks better than it ever did when I lived in the city, and I haven't had to touch a snow shovel in years. Working from home means I spend a lot of time staring out my office window, and for a while, I actually found the routine kind of soothing. It’s a very 'Aesthetic' lifestyle, you know? Crisp edges on the grass, no litter, no noisy kids screaming in the street while I’m on a conference call. I’ve even started naming the guys on the mowing crew in my head—I call the tall one 'High-Vis' and the guy who does the weed-whacking 'Stickers' because of a decal on his helmet.

I know some of you are going to say I’m just being paranoid or that I should be grateful for the 'private' neighborhood feel. And for the first year or two, I was. I’d just sit on my porch with a beer and enjoy the peace. But the novelty is wearing off. It’s the small things that get to you after a while. Like how there’s never any mail in the neighbors' boxes, but the mail carrier still stops at every single house to open and close the lids. It just feels like I’m living inside a clock that’s ticking for no one.

I actually walked out to talk to Stickers last week. I asked if people were finally moving in, or if this was just a service the city offers. He didn't even look up. He just said, ‘Just doing my job man,' and kept going.

I actually went on Zillow and some of those other listing sites a few months back just to see what the houses around me were going for. It’s the weirdest thing—the houses are all there on the map, but the listings haven't been updated since 2018. They all show as 'Off Market' or 'Status: Finalizing,' but the photos are what really gave me a chill. Every single interior shot, regardless of the address, is just a picture of the exact same rooms, living room, kitchen, bedrooms, right down to the layout of the outlets. It’s probably just a lazy developer using a template for the whole street, but staring at forty identical versions of the same house felt… off.

Is this just some weird tax loophole? Does the town maintain neighborhoods like this to keep property values up? I asked the lady at the diner about my street the other day, and she just kind of stared at me and asked if I wanted a refill on my coffee. She almost acted like she didn't even know where **▓▒▓▒▓▒** Drive was. Maybe I offended her or something.

If anyone else lives near **█░█░█░█** and knows what the deal is with this development, let me know. 

Anyway, I’m going to get back to work. I'll check back in the morning to see if anyone has a logical explanation. I'm just a little distracted because I was scrolling through my doorbell camera footage from this morning's trash run.

Usually, the truck just stops, tips the bin, and leaves. But today, after the arm set my bin down, the truck stayed idle for like an extra thirty seconds or so. No one got out, but just sat there for a bit right on the edge of my driveway, which is odd because of the consistency of the city. Almost felt as if the driver was waiting on something. Then the truck just moved on to the next empty house.

Well, if anyone knows anything or has any theories. Send them my way.
