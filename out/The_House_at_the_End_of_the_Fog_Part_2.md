The scream tore my throat raw, but the fog swallowed it whole.

Nothing echoed. Nothing carried.

The tapping stopped. For a moment, everything was still. Then the fingers slid down the glass with a slow, deliberate squeal, leaving behind faint streaks that glistened like snail trails.

I didn’t wait to see if it would come back. My hand shot for the door handle, flung it open, and I bolted. The air outside clung to me, wet and suffocating. I stumbled into the mist, my boots crunching gravel, then sinking into damp weeds.

Behind me, the car sat dark, a coffin with wheels.

But in front of me—my stomach dropped.

The house.

It was there again. Not behind me this time. Not down the road. Right in front of me, its silhouette rising from the fog like it had always been waiting. The porch light glared sickly yellow, throwing shadows across the yard. The curtains stirred, though no wind touched my skin.

I stopped dead. My body refused another step forward.

“Wake up,” I whispered. My voice sounded tiny. “This isn’t real.”

But the smell hit me—sharp, rancid, undeniable. Not dreamlike. Not vague. Real.

It was the smell of rot, of damp wood and mold blooming in unseen corners. Something long dead but never buried.

The door creaked open.

Not all the way—just enough to let a sliver of darkness spill out, deeper than the fog. The man was there again. Or maybe it wasn’t him. This one stood taller, his frame crooked, his head bent as if the ceiling pressed too low.

I couldn’t see his face. Only his teeth.

Rows of them, too many for one mouth, catching the light.

“You’ll catch cold,” he rasped. The voice was wet, like water gurgling through a clogged drain.

My legs moved without my permission. One step then another. Each one dragging me closer to the porch. My chest seized with panic, my brain screaming stop, stop, stop—but my body ignored it.

The porch boards groaned as I mounted the steps. The smell grew worse, seeping from the doorway like a living thing. My eyes watered, throat burning as if I’d swallowed something rotten.

Inside, I glimpsed walls lined with peeling wallpaper, the pattern hidden under swaths of black mold. The floor sagged, its boards warped, slick with something that looked wet.

I tried to speak, to beg, to run, but my lips only trembled.

The man—or the thing—stepped aside, inviting me in. His teeth didn’t close when his mouth did. They scraped against each other, clicking softly, hungry.

And then a sound split the silence.

Laughter.

It came from deeper in the house. High-pitched. Childlike. Except it wasn’t right. It didn’t rise and fall like real laughter—it chattered, stuttering, as if whoever—or whatever—was mimicking the sound didn’t quite understand how to make it human.

The thing with the teeth turned its head toward the sound, its grin twitching wider. It whispered:

“They’re so glad you came.”

My body leaned forward. The threshold yawned open before me, dark and damp. My toes brushed it.

Then I caught sight of something on the floorboards just inside.

A shoe.

Small. Pink. Caked with mud so thick it had dried into cracks.

A child’s shoe.

My body froze. Whatever pull the house had on me snapped for a heartbeat, enough for me to stumble back a step. I gasped air, choking on the stench, shaking so hard my knees nearly buckled.

The thing hissed. Not angry—amused. A low, rattling chuckle that scraped its way up from somewhere deep inside.

“Don’t wander,” it said. “The fog doesn’t give things back.”

The door slammed.

The porch light flickered once, twice, then went out.

I was swallowed by the fog again, standing in the yard with nothing but my pulse hammering in my ears. My car was gone. The road was gone. The signpost was gone.

Only the house remained.

Waiting.

The fog pressed closer with every breath I took. It crawled into my nose, slid across my tongue, filled my lungs with something too damp to be called air. My clothes clung heavy, soaked without rain.

The house loomed, the only shape in the suffocating white. Every time I blinked, I half expected it to be gone. But it wasn’t. It was patient. Watching.

I don’t remember deciding to go back up the steps. One moment I was staring at the dark outline of the porch, the next my boots were creaking against its boards again. My knuckles were white from gripping the railing, slick with mildew that smeared my palms.

The door opened before I touched it.

The hallway gaped like a throat. Light pooled inside—not warm, not welcoming. It was the jaundiced flicker of failing bulbs, swinging on cords that buzzed like angry flies.

And then came the voices.

Not from the man. Not from the grinning thing with too many teeth. These voices seeped from the walls themselves, muffled and desperate, like whispers through insulation.

“Get out.”

“Don’t look at them.”

“He’s listening.”

They overlapped, hushed but frantic, as though speaking too loudly would invite punishment.

I pressed myself against the frame, nails biting my palms. My heart felt like it had been torn loose, beating anywhere but inside my chest.

The stench of rot was stronger here. Sour, sweet, clinging to the back of my throat. A tang of copper underneath it, unmistakable: blood.

I whispered, “Who’s there?” though I regretted it instantly.

The whispers stopped.

The silence was worse.

I stepped inside. The floor flexed under my weight, boards sighing like tired lungs. My boots stuck to patches of tacky wetness, pulling free with obscene little kisses.

The wallpaper peeled in great curling strips, revealing wood beneath that pulsed faintly, as if it had veins.

Something scuttled overhead. Quick. Too fast for a person. Dust sifted down from the ceiling, carrying with it a smell so foul I gagged.

“Hello?” I croaked, hating the sound of my own voice in that place.

From deeper down the hallway came an answer. Not words. Not even sound at first—just a rhythmic thudding. Like fists beating against wood.

Thud.

Thud.

Thud.

The walls shivered with each impact. Paint flakes rained down, catching in my hair, sticking to my damp skin.

I turned back to the door. My chest clenched when I saw it.

It was gone.

Where I should’ve seen a rectangle of pale fog, there was only wall. Seamless. Papered over with the same rotting pattern. The knocker, the porch, the world outside—all gone.

I stumbled backward, bile burning my throat. The thudding grew faster, closer, until it sounded like it was right behind the wall nearest me. I pressed a shaking hand against it—

Something pressed back.

Fingers. Dozens of them, sharp and frantic, clawing from the other side. The wall bulged, paper tearing as black nails scraped through.

I screamed and stumbled away, but the voices returned, hissing from the plaster:

“Run.”

“Hide.”

“They’ll hear you.”

The thudding stopped. The scratching stopped.

And then—laughter again.

High, childlike, wrong.

It trickled down the hallway, echoing from room to room, weaving around me until I couldn’t tell where it came from. My skin crawled. My stomach turned inside out.

“Who’s there?” I shouted, voice cracking. “What do you want?”

The laughter cut off.

For a heartbeat, silence.

Then, from directly behind me, a voice whispered into my ear:

“You.”
