I’ve never been the type to post on here, but I don’t know where else to put this. My wife thinks I’m just stressed out from work, that my mind is playing tricks on me. Maybe she’s right. Perhaps I am cracking under the pressure. But the problem with that theory is simple: I know what I heard.

And what I heard did not come from my daughter.

My daughter, Emily, just turned three in July. She’s bright, curious, and a little too clever for her age. She loves dolls, anything with sparkles, and has recently developed a terrifyingly accurate “puppy dog eyes” look that makes it almost impossible to say no to her. She’s also developed what my wife and I chalked up as totally normal at first: an imaginary friend.

We laughed about it when she first mentioned him.

“His name’s Mister Red,” she said one night during dinner, holding a chicken nugget across the table like she was feeding someone invisible.

“Mister Red, huh?” I chuckled, glancing at my wife. “What does he look like?”

Emily tilted her head like she had to really think about it, then said, “He’s tall. And his eyes hurt.”

Weird, yeah, but kids are weird. They say creepy stuff sometimes without realizing it. My wife said the exact same thing I was thinking probably something she picked up from cartoons.

However, over the next couple of weeks, Mister Red started showing up more often in Emily’s stories. She’d leave room for him on the couch. She’d ask me to buckle him into the back seat of the car. Once, I even caught her whispering into the crack of her closet door and giggling like someone had whispered back.

It was unnerving, sure, but kids need imaginary friends. We told ourselves it was just her way of working through loneliness or practicing her social skills.

Until the night the baby monitor crackled.

We still keep the monitor in her room, even though she’s out of the baby stage. It helps us know when she wakes up in the middle of the night or needs water. I’m a light sleeper, so usually I hear her before the monitor even kicks in, but that night I woke up to static.

At first it was faint—just a gentle hiss. I thought maybe the batteries were dying. Then I heard Emily’s little voice.

“Okay. But Daddy said no.”

I sat up in bed, rubbing my eyes. My wife stirred beside me, groggy but not awake enough to notice.

Then came the second voice.

It was low. Too low to belong to a child. The kind of voice that doesn’t sound like it’s coming from a throat at all, but from somewhere deeper, like it’s been dragged up from under the floorboards.

“He won’t know.”

My blood ran cold. I froze, staring at the monitor glowing on the nightstand. Emily laughed softly. “You’re silly, Mister Red.”

I don’t remember getting out of bed. I just remember standing in her doorway, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. She was sitting up in bed, blankets bunched around her lap, smiling at the empty corner of the room.

“Em?” I whispered.

She looked up at me, startled. “Daddy! Mister Red said a bad word.”

I flicked on the light. The room was empty. Just toys scattered across the floor, her stuffed bunny at her side, and the baby monitor on her nightstand, its little green light flickering like nothing had happened.

“Time to sleep,” I said, forcing calm into my voice. I tucked her back in and kissed her forehead, trying to ignore the way her eyes darted back to the corner.

As I left the room, I heard her whisper again, soft as a breath:

“Shh. He doesn’t like when you look at him.”

I didn’t sleep the rest of that night.

That was the first time I heard Mister Red.

And it wasn’t the last. The night I first heard Mister Red, I told myself I must have been half asleep, caught in that fog where dreams bleed into waking. But the more I tried to convince myself, the less I believed it.

Because the voice had weight. A presence. A voice that makes your bones feel hollow.

The next morning, I made coffee, stronger than usual and decided not to mention what happened last night to my wife. What would I even say? Hey, honey, I think our daughter’s imaginary friend is real, and maybe Satan?

Emily was chipper at breakfast, swinging her legs under the chair as she dunked her cereal spoon into the milk.

“Mister Red doesn’t like milk,” she said casually

I blinked. “What does Mister Red like, then?”

Her little face went serious. “He likes when people bleed.”

My wife nearly choked on her toast.

“Emily!” she scolded, setting her plate down with a clatter. “That is not a funny thing to say. Where did you hear that?”

Emily frowned, her lower lip wobbling like she was about to cry. “Mister Red told me.”

I caught my wife’s eyes across the table. She looked uneasy but forced a smile. “Sweetie, you can’t say things like that. That’s not… appropriate.” Emily’s shoulders hunched as she returned to her cereal, and that was the end of it—for her, at least. For me, the words rang in my head the rest of the day.

A week later, the monitor woke me again. This time, there was no mistaking it.

The static came first, but then I heard whispering. Low, insistent, too quick to make out. Emily’s voice responded, giggling, “Okay, but only if Daddy doesn’t find out.”

My skin prickled.

The other voice followed. Clearer this time. Closer.

“He always finds out. That’s why we’ll have to hurt him first.”

I shot out of bed, nearly tripping over the sheets. My wife groaned.

“What the hell, babe?” she mumbled, eyes still shut.

“Emily,” I muttered, already halfway down the hall.

When I opened her door, she was sitting upright again, her small face lit by the glow of the nightlight.

“Who are you talking to?” I demanded. She pointed at the corner of the room, the same corner as last time. “Mister Red.”

The closet door was cracked open an inch.

I slammed it shut without looking inside and scooped her into my arms. She squirmed and protested, but I carried her into our bedroom and laid her between me and my wife.

The next morning, I told my wife everything—about the monitor, about the voice.

She rubbed her temples, exhausted. “You’re working sixty hours a week, barely sleeping, and now you’re scaring yourself. Kids say weird shit all the time, it doesn’t mean it’s real.”

“I know what I heard,” I snapped.

She stared at me, hurt flickering across her face. “So what—you think something’s actually in there with her?”

I didn’t answer.

Because I did.

That night, I unplugged the monitor and put it in the drawer. I thought maybe if I didn’t hear it, it would stop. But Emily didn’t stop.

At dinner, she told us Mister Red “likes Mommy’s hair.”

During bath time, she asked if blood floats. And once, while coloring, she leaned close to me and whispered, “Mister Red says he can make me a new Daddy if you go away.”

I dropped the crayon I’d been holding. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

When I told my wife later, she shook her head. “You’re feeding into this. The more attention you give it, the worse it gets. Just ignore it. She’ll grow out of it.”

But that night, when I tucked Emily in, she said something that made my stomach turn to stone.

“Daddy, can you sleep with me tonight?”

“Why, Em?” I asked gently.

Her eyes darted to the corner again. “Because Mister Red says he wants to talk to you.”

I didn’t sleep a single minute after that.

I stopped trusting my own ears after that. Every creak of the house, every whisper of the furnace turning on, every sound from the monitor made me wonder if it was all just in my head.

I told myself it had to be stress. Long hours at work. Too much caffeine. Too little sleep. A bad combination for anyone’s mind.

But then there was Emily. She wasn’t just talking about Mister Red anymore. She was talking like him.

One morning I found her standing in front of the bathroom mirror, whispering. Her lips moved in sharp, jerky motions that didn’t sound like her voice at all—low, guttural noises, like a bad impression of an adult trying to sound “scary.”

When she noticed me, she smiled wide enough to show her gums.

“Mister Red says Mommy shouldn’t leave the house today.”

My skin crawled. “Why?”

Her smile twitched. “Because cars don’t stop fast enough.”

I didn’t let my wife drive to work that day.

She was furious with me, of course. Said I was becoming paranoid, overprotective. Said I was letting our daughter’s imagination control my life.

But she wasn’t there when I saw the look in Emily’s eyes. She wasn’t there when I felt that cold draft brush the back of my neck even though the windows were shut tight.

I started digging.

Late nights after my wife and daughter were asleep, I sat hunched over the glow of my laptop, searching for anything I could find. Maybe Mister Red was something I’d read about years ago. A story lodged in my brain that Emily overheard me mention. Something explainable. But what I found made me feel sick.

In the county records, our house had been sold twice in ten years. The previous owners left after just fourteen months. Before that, the family had stayed less than a year. No one seemed to keep it longer than that.

I found an archived local newspaper article, too—dated fifteen years ago. A child had gone missing from the house across the street. A boy, six years old. They never found his body. The mother claimed he’d been talking to someone she couldn’t see in his room at night. The paper didn’t use the words “imaginary friend,” but that’s what it sounded like to me.

The missing boy’s name? Caleb.

And in one grainy black-and-white photo, clipped from the article, the mother was standing on her porch. Behind her, in the shadows of the hallway, something thin and dark seemed to stretch along the wall. Too tall to be her. Too crooked to be a shadow.

I clicked off the screen so fast my mouse slipped from my hand.

When I brought all this to my wife, she just stared at me.

“Do you even hear yourself?” she asked. “You’re digging through fifteen-year-old newspapers looking for monsters under the bed. Do you realize how insane that sounds?”

“It’s not insane if it’s happening,” I shot back.

She pressed her hands to her face. “No. What’s happening is that Emily is picking up on your anxiety. Kids are sponges. You act paranoid, she’ll start acting paranoid too.” I wanted to argue, but just then Emily wandered into the room, dragging her stuffed bunny by one ear. Her hair was mussed from sleep.

“Daddy,” she said softly. “Mister Red says you shouldn’t talk about him. He doesn’t like that.”

Her eyes flicked to my laptop bag on the counter.

Then she smiled.

That night, I woke to a sound that made my stomach drop.

It wasn’t Emily’s voice.

It was a laugh.

Deep. Crooked. Filtered through static, spilling from the baby monitor like bile.

And this time, my wife heard it too.

She sat bolt upright beside me, clutching my arm, her face pale in the dark.

“Jesus Christ,” she whispered. “What the hell was that?”

I didn’t answer. Because I already knew. It wasn’t imaginary.

It was in the house.

After the laugh, nothing in our house felt the same.

It lingered in the walls, that sound. Even when the monitor was silent, I swore I could hear it echoing faintly in the pipes, or in the buzz of the fridge motor, or just under the scratch of my own breath.

My wife stopped calling me paranoid after that night. She didn’t admit I’d been right, but she didn’t have to. The way she double-checked the locks, the way she avoided the hallway to Emily’s room after dark—that was admission enough.

The first object moved two days later.

I came into the living room to find Emily’s stuffed bunny sitting upright on the coffee table. She was in her room at the time. My wife was in the shower. Nobody had put it there.

When I asked Emily about it later, she just shrugged. “Mister Red wanted to see if he could sit like me.”

The way she said it so casually made bile rise in my throat.

After that, little things started happening. Keys in the freezer. A drinking glass upside down in the middle of the hallway. My phone left in Emily’s closet, though I knew I’d plugged it in by my bed the night before.

And then the scratches started. Thin lines on the walls, on the backs of doors, across the wood floor. Too high for Emily. Too deep for a child. They weren’t words—not exactly—but sometimes they almost looked like shapes. Twisted stick figures. A circle with too many lines shooting out of it like crooked sun rays.

I caught my wife staring at one of them on the wall above our headboard one morning, her hand trembling as she traced the grooves. She didn’t say anything, but that night, she slept with the lamp on.

Emily changed too.

She stopped eating her favorite foods, but sometimes I’d find crumbs in her bed from things we hadn’t given her. Saltine crackers. Beef jerky. Things I knew we didn’t keep in the house.

Her voice would dip without warning—mid-sentence, like a switch being flipped.

One afternoon, while coloring at the kitchen table, she looked up at me with wide eyes and said in a gravelly tone that did not belong to her:

“Do you ever wonder how hot skin gets before it bubbles?”

The crayon snapped in my hand.

She blinked, then laughed, her normal little-girl laugh. “Daddy, you broke it!”

My wife took her into the yard after that, and I sat at the table staring at the broken crayon until I realized my palm was bleeding. The baby monitor became worse than useless. It was no longer just a tool—it was an open wound in the house.

Sometimes, I’d hear heavy breathing. Sometimes, a scraping sound, like fingernails dragged across a microphone. And sometimes, a voice that wasn’t quite Emily’s and wasn’t quite anyone else’s.

Once, it said my name.

Not “Daddy.”

Not “Dad.”

My actual name.

Drawn out in a wet, gurgling whisper that rattled the speaker until I thought it might burst.

That was the night my wife finally broke.

We both stood frozen in bed, staring at the monitor. The voice rasped my name again, long and slow. Emily giggled in the background.

Then, clear as day:

“Come upstairs, Joel. She wants you to see.”

My wife clapped her hand over her mouth to stifle a scream. I bolted down the hall, but before I even touched the knob, Emily’s bedroom door creaked open by itself. Just an inch. Just enough to show me that the closet door inside was standing wide open, darkness yawning out of it like a throat.

I slammed the door shut. I shoved a chair under the knob. And for the first time in my life, I prayed aloud, my voice cracking like a child’s.

Behind the door, Emily laughed again.

And something else laughed with her.

The next morning, my wife wanted to leave. Pack up, get a hotel, anything. But Emily cried and screamed like we were trying to kill her.

“Mister Red said we can’t leave yet!” she shrieked, her face red and twisted in rage. “He said it’s not done!”

Her voice dropped on the last word, and for a moment, her little body shook like a puppet yanked on invisible strings.

We didn’t leave.

Not yet.

Because the worst part wasn’t what Mister Red was doing to Emily.

It was that some part of me believed if we left… he’d follow. I didn’t want to dig any deeper. Every instinct in me screamed to get my wife, grab Emily, and burn the whole goddamn house down. But fear does strange things—it makes you hesitate, makes you want answers before action. As if knowing the “why” will somehow keep you safe from the “what.”

So I kept digging.

At the local library, I requested the microfilm records for our neighborhood. A hushed, fluorescent-lit basement, dust thick in the air, pages of brittle newsprint flicking under my fingers.

And there they were.

Not just Caleb—the missing boy from across the street. There were more.

1978: Local child, Rebecca H., disappears from her bed. Police suspect abduction. No leads.

1989: Toddler, Michael R., found dead in his crib. Cause of death undetermined. Parents reported “strange activity in the home” prior to incident.

1994: Two sisters, ages four and six, claim “the red man” visits them at night. Parents institutionalized for child neglect after insisting the figure was real.

Different names, different decades. Always children. Always houses within a four-block radius of ours.

And in every article, the parents were quoted describing the same thing: A friend.

A voice at night.

A presence in the room that didn’t belong. One article made my stomach turn to ice.

2007: Local man found dead by self-inflicted wounds. Note recovered: “I tried to keep him away from my daughter. He wants the young ones. He always has.”

The man’s name was Daniel Cooper. He lived in our house.

I sat there for hours, photocopying everything with shaking hands. Names, addresses, dates—all pieces of the same pattern.

When I brought the stack home, my wife flipped through it with wide, horrified eyes.

“Jesus Christ,” she whispered. “It’s the same… over and over.”

Her hands trembled as she set the papers down. “Why didn’t the real estate agent—why didn’t anyone tell us?”

“Because they don’t put ‘haunted by child-murdering demons on the disclosure form.”

She shot me a look, but I could see the fear in her face mirrored mine.

Emily found us later that night, hunched over the dining table with the papers spread out like evidence in a trial. She climbed into a chair and peered at the photocopied articles with curious eyes.

“Those are Mister Red’s friends,” she said softly. My wife stiffened. “What do you mean, sweetie?”

Emily tapped one of the clippings with her finger—Rebecca’s obituary. “They still play with him. In the closet.”

Her little face brightened with a grin too wide for comfort. “He says soon I can go with them too.”

My wife ripped the papers away like they were poison, shoving them into a drawer. Her voice shook as she told Emily it was bedtime.

But the look on my daughter’s face… it wasn’t disappointment.

It was anticipation.

That night, after Emily was asleep, I pulled the baby monitor out of the drawer and set it on the nightstand. My wife glared but didn’t stop me.

Static. Soft breathing.

And then—whispers.

Dozens of them. Children’s voices, layered and thin, overlapping like radio signals crossing each other.

And under them all, deep and steady, that same voice that had haunted me since the first night.

“He keeps them,” it said. “They never grow. They never leave. Soon, she will join them.” The monitor popped and hissed like something wet inside the speaker.

My wife turned her face into the pillow, sobbing.

I sat frozen, unable to move, and unable to breathe. That night was the breaking point.

I woke from my trance to Emily screaming. Not crying, not having a nightmare—screaming. Her voice tore through the house like glass shattering. My wife and I bolted down the hall, fumbling for the light switch.

The bulb popped the moment it flicked on. Darkness swallowed us whole.

Emily’s door slammed shut before we reached it. We threw ourselves against it, but it wouldn’t budge. From inside came laughter—not hers. Low, guttural, rolling like thunder too close to the ground.

“Open the door!” my wife screamed, pounding her fists raw against the wood.

Then Emily’s small voice, muffled:

“It’s okay, Mommy. He’s almost done making me new.”

I swear to God I felt something move past me in the hall. Not running. Gliding. A brush of heat against my arm like a furnace exhaling. My wife whimpered.

The monitor on the nightstand flicked to life on its own. Static surged, and then a dozen voices spilled through at once—children whispering, overlapping, crying. And underneath them, steady and deep:

“She’s mine now.”

The door flung open before I could kick it down. The room was wrong.

The air was heavy, like breathing through wet cloth. The closet door was wide open, and the darkness inside wasn’t the absence of light—it was thicker, like tar. Shapes shifted within it, small outlines of children pressing at the edge but never crossing. Their eyes gleamed like marbles sunk in mud.

Emily stood at the threshold, her hands outstretched toward them.

My wife screamed her name.

That’s when I saw him.

Tall. Red—not blood red, not crimson, but the raw, blistered color of burned flesh. Limbs too long, joints bent backward, his face a smear of shadow with two pits where eyes should be.

And he was crouched low, one skeletal hand hovering over Emily’s shoulder.

I didn’t think. I just ran forward, grabbed her, and yanked her back. The hand snapped closed where she’d been a second before, claws raking through air.

The sound he made when she slipped from his reach—God, I’ll never forget it. Like rusted metal grinding against itself. We ran. We didn’t stop to pack, didn’t stop to look back. We carried Emily out of the house in her nightgown and drove until the sun rose.

We’ve been staying at a motel for two days now. Emily barely speaks. When she does, it’s nonsense—half-formed sentences in that guttural tone that doesn’t belong to her. My wife won’t sleep without every light in the room on.

And me?

I thought maybe we’d escaped.

Until tonight.

Because the monitor is glowing again. Sitting on the dresser across from me.

I never brought it here.

It shouldn’t even exist anymore—I broke it into pieces and left them behind.

But it’s here.

And the static is rising.

And now, under it, I can hear Emily’s voice.

“Daddy, he says you can’t keep me forever.” If anyone reads this—please, if you’re house hunting, if you have kids—check the history. Look for the names.

And if your child ever whispers about a man called Mister Red—

get out before he comes for you too.
