I don't know exactly how it happened.  


Everything was going great. It was Valentine's Day. My wife had just left for work. And I had just put the second batch of her favorite cookies in the oven for when she returned home.  


The only catch is, after I put them in the oven...  


...I completely forgot that it was Valentine's Day.  


Maybe I was distracted by all my work calls.   


Maybe I'm just getting old.  


All that matters is, when I emerged from my home office a little while later...  


...The entire kitchen had gone up in flames...  


...And a few hours later...  


...My entire house had burnt to the ground.  


—  


When my wife finally got home, after racing back from work, it immediately didn't matter to her that it was Valentine's Day anymore.  


She was just glad that I was alive.  


"Are you okay?" She asked, tears in her eyes, as she ran over to me, as I stood outside, shivering, wrapped in a blanket beside a fire truck.  


"Yeah I'll be ok. Can't say the same for the house." I joked, gesturing to the destroyed building.  


We both looked over at our home of nearly ten years, as firefighters put out the last of its smoking embers.  


She couldn't help but laugh. "Were you able to salvage anything?"  


"Oh!" I replied, before reaching into the pocket of my sweatshirt and pulling out a large, sealed plastic bag full of cookies. "Forgot to tell you. I was able to grab the first batch on the way out."  


"Aww." She said.  


"Want one?" I offered, reaching to open the bag, but she stopped me.  


"No, I don't have an appetite right now, after all this. But maybe later."  


"No worries." I said, putting the bag of cookies back into my sweatshirt pocket.  


"What now?" She asked.  


"Hotel I guess?" I proposed.  


"Well we could stay with my mom, but that's a two hour drive. After this, that sounds like a lot."  


That's when a firefighter overheard us, and interjected.  


"Sorry to eavesdrop, but if you don't have anywhere to go. I've got a spare bedroom at my house, down by the harbor. If you're too tired to drive tonight." He offered, with a sympathetic look on his face.  


"Thanks, I really appreciate that." I replied, "But we couldn't. It's a really kind gesture, though. Seriously."  


"Thank you though, it means a lot." My wife added.  


"Oh, of course." The firefighter replied, "No pressure at all. Just with you here like this, I wouldn't have been able to sleep tonight knowing I didn't offer."  


He turned away, took a few steps, and then doubled back. "You sure? It really would be no bother to me at all."  


My wife and I each looked at each other, exhausted.   


"I suppose it beats paying for a hotel." I reasoned.  


"Or a two hour drive." My wife said.  


—  


A couple hours later, we were sitting in the firefighter's kitchen, eating a dinner that he had made for us.  


"Seriously though, we'll forever be in your debt for this." I said, slurping pasta.  


"Are you kidding?" The firefighter replied, as he did the same. "After what you've gone through today, it's the least I could do."  


"You really saved us a long drive to my mom's place." My wife said, after taking a bite.  


"Can I ask you a question, though?" The firefighter asked, putting his fork down.  


"Of course." I replied.  


"What was it about me, that earned your trust?" He continued.  


"Our trust?" My wife asked.  


"Yeah, like was it the uniform? Or my charm?" He said.  


"Uh, I don't know. Why?" She replied.  


"Just curious what exactly lowered your guard enough to come back with me, to my house. A stranger's house." The firefighter continued.  


I couldn't tell if he was joking, or was looking for a straight answer. So I went with the latter. "Uh, maybe a combination of both? But if I had to pick one. Maybe the uniform? Everyone trusts a firefighter."  


"Really? Thank you! That's what I thought, but the others, they all said it was my charm, and I’m really starting to think that the uniform alone really seals the deal." He said.  


"The others?" I asked.  


"Yeah, the others. Downstairs." The firefighter replied.  


"I'm sorry, I'm not following. There's other people downstairs?" My wife asked.  


"Yeah, like you." He said nonchalantly.  


"What do you mean?" I asked.  


"Like people I found, in desperate situations, like yours, that needed help." The firefighter explained.  


"And... what are they doing down there?" I added.  


"Oh, there's a whole dungeon down there." He said, with a completely straight face.  


"A... dungeon?" I asked.  


"Yeah, like with torture devices, and a maze and everything. It's actually really cool, do you want to see it?" He offered.  


My wife and I both looked at each other, then back at the firefighter...  


...And suddenly burst out laughing…  


...As he, too, began to roar with laughter.  


Eventually, the laughing subsided, and the kitchen got awkwardly quiet, so I tried to change the subject. "Anyways, great pasta sauce. Is that cumin in there?”  


But he ignored me, and picked up right where he left off. "No, but seriously, you've gotta check it out. Like literally, you have no choice."  


I just played along, hoping he would change the subject. "Yeah, yeah, okay, fine, fine, we'll check it out. After dinner."  


But he wouldn't let it go. "No. Now." He commanded, his facing turning from jovial to menacing.  


The joke was growing old, and starting to get a bit creepy, so I stood up from my seat and gestured for my wife to get up. "Come on, let's go."  


"Go? I'm afraid that's not possible." The firefighter replied, "The doors and windows are locked from the inside out, and only I can open them."  


That's when I decided that he had crossed the line, so I puffed up my chest, and started to move closer to him in a threatening fashion.  


"Dude, seriously? I'm a firefighter. I'm in the best shape of my life. And you, no offense, look like you don't even work out."  


I couldn’t help but take offense, but I still thought he was joking, so I just smiled back nervously.  


"Oh, and I've got an ax." He added, removing a firefighter's ax from under the table and holding it up before us.  


He was not joking.  


Seeing the weapon, my wife jumped up from her seat, and we both ran to the door, only to find it locked from the inside, just as he had told us.  


"Told you."

A few minutes later, we were standing at the foot of his basement, having just descended a rickety flight of stairs.  


The firefighter must have noticed me walking nervously down them, as he had followed behind us.  


"Oh, please excuse the stairs." He apologized, "I really need to get them replaced. But with all of the construction I've been doing in the dungeon and all, they just haven't been a priority."  


I didn't know what to think of any of it. I was just hoping it would end.  


But it didn't.  


"Ok, so here's how it works." The firefighter began, pointing his ax toward the entrance to what, literally, looked like a dungeon. "I'm gonna give you a five minute head start, during which time I'd suggest you run as fast as you can. Now, at the end of the maze, there is an exit. And if you make it there, I promise I'll let you out. But for full transparency, no one has ever made it that far. Cause, you know, they don't know the maze, and I designed it, so I kinda have the upper hand. But maybe you'll be the first?"  


My wife and I just stared at each other with a look of horror, as it became clear that this was actually happening.  


"Anyways, you're gonna see a lot of fucked up shit in there. People are gonna beg and plead for you to take them with you. But whatever you do, do not give in. I know in the moment you're gonna want to do the right thing but, trust me, based on how it's gone in the past, they're just gonna slow you down, and you're gonna need every second you can get." He then turned to us, as if to make sure we were listening, and asked, "Got it?"  


To which I, unsure of what to say, just replied, "Uh... yeah.".  


That's when he pulled out a stopwatch, put his thumb to the start button...  


"Ok ready... get set.... go!"  


...And clicked it.  


I looked over at my wife, whose eyes had grown wide with fear...  


...And, without hesitation, grabbed her by the hand, darting off with her into the dungeon.  


—  


Five minutes later, we were running through the maze below the firefighter's house, uncertain of our exact progress but confident that we had made it pretty far into its depths, when we stumbled onto a man, locked up in a cage, his body emaciated from what must have been starvation.  


"Help me!" He called out, "Take me with you!"  


My wife stopped for a moment, a look of sadness in her eyes, and began to reach out to him, but I intercepted her hand and led her past him, further into the maze.  


"We have to keep going!" I called out.  


"I feel terrible leaving another behind." She replied.  


He wasn't the first we'd seen. In fact, in just that previous five minutes alone, we'd encountered many of the countless others that the firefighter was referring to, and what seemed like a hundred unspeakable horrors.  


But we had stayed strong and forged ahead, and as a result, I felt like we were getting close to the end of the maze.  


"We're no use to them unless we get out of this place, and call for help." I assured her.  


"You're right." She replied.  


"We must be getting close to the exit."  


"If there even is one."  


She had a point. There was a possibility that the firefighter had lied to us, and there was no exit at the end of the maze.  


But there was something about the way that he talked, something so honest and direct, that made me think there actually was a way out at the end. And the more I thought about it, I was confident that without an actual exit, for us to potentially reach, there'd be no fun in the game that he'd created for himself.  


"Trust me." I said.  


"I trust you." My wife replied.  


That's when we heard it. The unsettling sound of someone whistling, coming from behind us in the maze, and approaching quickly.  


"Run!" My wife said, her sense of hopelessness now transforming into one of survival.  


—  


By the time we finally made it to the end of the maze, the firefighter had caught up to us, still whistling. But when he turned the corner and saw us, standing at the door, tugging at its locked doorknob, he dropped his shoulders. "Aw, man. Seriously?"  


I tried to bring myself to speak, but my body was frozen in fear.  


Finally, I let out the words, "Seriously, what?"  


"You beat me to the exit. You're the first ones to do it." He said.  


He started running over to us, ax still in hand, as I closed my eyes, bracing for impact and fearing the worst...  


...But rather than feel pain, I felt...  


...A hug. A gentle, warm, embrace...  


...Before I opened my eyes and saw him hug my wife as well.  


"Congratulations! That is no easy feat." The firefighter said, "I mean, that is one disturbing, and distracting place. Luck was on your side. Wait, no, sorry, I shouldn't assume luck. You did make it to the end so skill must have been a factor. I don't want to take that away from you."  


My wife and I just stood there, waiting for him to get to the point.  


"So, um..." My wife said, gesturing to the door. "Do we still get to leave?"  


"Get to leave? Get to leave? How dare you!" He said, in a serious tone… before cracking a smile and patting us both on the back, "I'm just fucking with you, of course you get to leave! I am a man of my word, and you did play by the rules and win."  


The firefighter walked over to the door, removed a key ring full of keys from his pocket, and began rummaging through it, "Let's see here..."  


Until he finally picked one and held it up.   


"...There it is!" The firefighter continued, "But can you imagine if I forgot the key ring upstairs and had to go all the way back through that maze?" He said with a chuckle, opening the door from the basement into his backyard.  


My wife and I both looked outside, into the darkness, and immediately started walking towards the exit, before the firefighter put his hand out and said. "Not so fast. I said I'm a man of my word, and I am. I told you earlier that if you made it to the exit, I'd let you out. However..."  


I suddenly realized there was a caveat.  


"...There's one slight caveat." He continued, "When I do let you out, there just so happens to be two dogs out there, that I keep extremely hungry for this very occasion. So when you get out there, I just want to warn you, it's highly probable that'll tear you both apart. Actually, scratch that, it’s one hundred percent probable.”  


Between the fire and the maze, my wife and I were both so exhausted, that we both looked at each other, nodded in agreement, and walked out into the backyard, ready to accept our fate.  


Then, we looked back at the firefighter, who said, "What? Don't look at me like that? I can't just be letting people escape from here so they can go and tell the cops about this place. Anyways, it's been fun. And sorry I had to make an already bad day even worse. On Valentine's Day no less. Anyways, goodbye."  


And like that...  


...He slammed the door behind him, leaving us out there in the backyard, standing there in the dark.  


—  


A few minutes later…  


…We suddenly heard the sound of dogs growling.  


And as my eyes adjusted to the light, sure enough, I saw two sickly pitbulls, drooling and howling as they approached us, hunched over, and ready to attack…  


...Until it hit me...  


...The Valentine's Day cookies!  


Without hesitation, I reached into my sweatshirt pocket and removed the plastic bag of cookies that I had offered my wife when we were standing outside our burning home, just a few hours earlier. To be precise, the first batch of the very cookies that had set said home ablaze, thus setting off a chain of events that led us to that very moment.  


As the dogs got closer and closer, I carefully, and quietly unzipped the plastic bag, turned it upside down, and dropped the cookies on the ground...  


...And like that, as soon as the dogs got a whiff of the cookies, they charged over to them and started devouring and fighting over them, in the process completely forgetting about my wife and I.  


Together, we slowly walked past the pitbulls, turned around, and backed away slowly, until we eventually reached the fence at the far end of the backyard and, one by one, my wife going first, hopped the fence and ran to safety.  


—  


Later that night, while we sat in the police station, waiting to tell them everything, my wife, still in a daze from what had happened, asked, "What flavor were they?"  


"Huh?" I replied, still in a daze of my own.  


"The cookies. What flavor were they?"  


"Your favorite of course. Peanut butter and chocolate chips."  


"Fuck."  


"You know, when I saved that first batch from the house. I was like, if these things are gonna burn my house down, we've at least gotta taste them. But you never got to."  


"It's the thought that counts."  


"I suppose so."  


"Happy Valentine's Day." She said.  


"Happy Valentine's Day." I replied.  


And then, we both leaned in, and kissed, in a way we hadn’t done in years. Like when we first met, over a decade ago.  


We may not have had a home anymore. Or any faith left in humanity. But we had each other. And sometimes, that's enough.  


That was last night, and today, while the police hopefully raid that motherfucker's house, you better believe that I'm gonna be at my mother-in-law's place, baking another batch of those cookies.
