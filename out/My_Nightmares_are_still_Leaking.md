In case you missed my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12i9y1b/my_nightmares_are_leaking/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), here's what you need to know: 

I'm Simran, a perpetually tired South-Asian American student struggling to get through each day. At school, I have to deal with my learning disabilities and behavioral problems caused by relentless bullying. At home, my parents take turns tormenting me. Not even sleep offers respite because my nightmares show me horrible, too-real visions of other worlds. Maybe by recounting them here, I can get closer to solving the mystery and towards a peaceful night's sleep...

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm in a brightly lit room. I don't know how long I've been here. It is a perfect cube, bare except for sheer white lights and white walls. Across from me is a young girl in a hooded, white robe. She has long dark hair that obscures part of her face and falls past her shoulders. In-between us is a small rectangular box, made of worn dark brown leather with coppery metal straps and buckles. 

She drops her hood and moves the hair away from her face. I can see clearly now. Her eyes and mouth are oriented vertically. She flashes me a brilliant smile with rows of shiny white teeth that go the wrong way. I am both disturbed and captivated by her. Her individual features are normal, but her layout is all wrong, as if a child were given the puzzle pieces to make a human and decided to stitch them together in a funny way. She again brushes away the hair from her too-long eyes, and begins to giggle as she starts undoing the latches of the box. 

Inside it nestles a pristine metal hammer on top of an oil-soaked rag; the hammer is the typical kind you would use to do household repairs. Her eyes are bright with excitement as she polishes the tool with the rag. She then walks over to me and laughs as she smacks the back of the hammer against my right cheek, tearing the flesh along the prongs. I want to scream but I have no voice - this makes the pain worse. She flips the hammer then starts bashing with the blunt end along my joints. 

I throw up my arms in defense and try to move away, but I am affixed to the spot. All I can do is scream inside, voicelessly, as she breaks bone after bone, smashing, crunching, and crashing. She readies herself and takes aim, practicing the arc of the swing. Once she feels confident, she drives a home run - right into my eyeball. Next, she tilts my head to the floor and opens my mouth. The prongs of the hammer are resting against the back of my top front teeth, digging into my gums. With a gleeful smile, she stomps on my head, breaking teeth and shattering bones. I feel the shock all the way in the back of my brain. She picks up the bloody instrument and continues bashing away with the meticulousness of a seasoned pro. The blood pools around me as fresh vermilion flecks streak her face and white robes with every hit. Eventually, everything fades to black...

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

When I come to, I'm in the same situation all over again, except worse. Instead of one robed girl, there are two. They hold hands and giggle. One of the walls of my prison cube has become transparent glass. It reveals a window into a butcher shop, with all the accoutrements for slicing and dicing big hunks of flesh laid out. On the meat hook, however, hangs a familiar sight. It's my body, broken and smashed by the hammer, speared through the neck by a rusty metal hook, hanging in the air. The well wornness of the butcher shop makes the sterility of my immediate situation that much more eerie. 

The girls open the box. Inside are various needles of differing shapes and sizes. All look wicked sharp. With the joy of a child picking out their favorite candies, the girls each grab a selection of needles both large and small, thick and thin. They proceed with the work - my body is a pin cushion for their devious art. They play games, piercing segments of skin like kebab skewers, digging and prodding inside my flesh. I can't fight nor can I complain. I exist to endure their sick amusement. All I can do is pray for another death. I breathe as thousands of pricks slowly bleed throughout my body, each millisecond bringing a new definition to the meaning of agony. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

Darkness again. When I wake up this time, I've moved past the shock. As I gaze upon my needle-covered body, I feel overwhelming disgust. I want to throw up, but whatever spell keeps me in place and keeps me from screaming also prevents this. I close my eyes, take a deep breath and look across. This time, there are four. The box has been replaced by a large wooden trunk. They open it and howl with delight as they each draw a drill. My vision starts to blur at this sight, and I can't read the logos on the tools. All I see are the gnarly, long drill bits attached to the ends, glistening in the bright light of the room. As the high-pitched whirring begins, I close my eyes in anticipation. 

They drill, drill, drill. Through skin, past bone, into guts. They stir up my insides into a slurry. I explode bits of flesh and soft tissue mixed with fragments of bone in all directions. As they revel in the madness, I find myself smiling too. The pain is so intense, my body has gone into shock. It rejects any further inputs; it cannot handle anymore. So I smile - it's just a dream, right? It'll be over soon. 

Again. And again. I wake up. There are more of them. They have different tools - corrosive acid, dull chainsaws, burning brands. The worst are the slow methods. How long do you think it takes to die from being beaten over and over again by a group of girls wielding thin tree branches? First you go blind as the switches are thin enough to take out your eyes. Then you have to wait for all the individual cuts to build up as your skin repeatedly gets rawer and rawer. I'm not sure if I eventually die from blood loss or dehydration, but when I wake up, my dead bodies are all smiling at me with crooked lips, just like the girls'. They twitch and writhe on their meat hooks, trying to break free. This time, there's nobody across from me. No box, no glass between the butcher shop and my prison cell. 

Thump. The first one drops to the floor. It's the one that was smashed to bits by a hammer. I guess the broken neck helped it get free. It stumbles toward me, its eyes lifeless, animated by an overwhelming desire for revenge. It wants me to experience the same things it did - me with my fresh body. It does not know that I've experienced not only its death, but the culmination of all the others. Unfortunately, this is not something I can communicate. I am stuck, ready to be punished again. Thump, thump, thump. Several others drop. I hear the power tools revving and whirring as they advance towards me. They descend with a frenzied madness different from the girls. It is not something they do for joy; this is a need, a compulsion. They crowd and overwhelm me, and soon I join their ranks. The cycle continues, until...

I wake up, coughing, gagging, choking. I sit up and spit out. On the ground are small chunks of torn flesh and scarlet blood. The inside of my right cheek is a chewed up mess, and there are small gashes along the outside in the shape of a "V." My mouth tastes like metal.
