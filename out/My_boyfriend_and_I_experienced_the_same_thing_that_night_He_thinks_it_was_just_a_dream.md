We were staying at this cabin on the lake for the weekend. It belonged to my family and sat on the waterfront, surrounded by woods. It was our last night there and my boyfriend and I just had an argument. I don’t even remember what it was about, I just know it was something petty. I refused to talk to him, and we both ended up just calling it a night.

We went to bed facing away from each other like stubborn kids. He fell asleep right away, but I couldn’t. I was lying in bed trying my hardest to fall asleep, still upset.

That’s when I sensed it. This thick, heavy presence, right next to my side of the bed. I immediately pulled the covers up to my ears, leaving just enough room to breathe, and curled into a ball.

At this point I was so damn creeped out that even though I was still mad at him, I turned over and cuddled up next to my boyfriend. I just wanted to feel safe and secure, and as silly as it may seem, as I lay there desperate to fall asleep, I started praying that it was only my imagination.

I was trying my best to think happy thoughts to calm myself down, but whatever I felt behind me now seemed like it was hovering above me… like it was trying to get my attention.

I tried my best to ignore it while lying there for what seemed like an eternity, but eventually I fell asleep.

The next day my boyfriend and I talked through our petty argument and everything was fine. We had breakfast, did some cleaning, basically just enjoying our last morning there before we had to pack up and head home.

Fast forward to a few hours later. We’re in the car and about halfway home, when out of nowhere, my boyfriend hits me with “Oh, I forgot to tell you about this disturbing dream I had last night!”.

“I woke up in bed at the cabin. I was facing the wall and I saw this black mist next to the bed, I looked over to see if you were seeing it but you were asleep. I looked back and the mist started swirling up and stretching to the ceiling. I tried saying your name to wake you up, but nothing would come out, and then all of the sudden I could no longer move. I was stuck there lying on my back while I watched this mist spread above us… hovering over the bed.”

As soon as he told me that, everything came rushing back. To be honest, I completely forgot about what I experienced the night before, but after hearing about his dream it made me realize we both experienced the same exact thing.

I immediately told him about the presence that I felt hovering over me last night, but I could tell by his tone that he was skeptical. Like maybe it was too convenient that I experienced something so similar to his dream, but I know what I felt. And his dream just confirmed that whatever was in that cabin with us was real, whether he believed me or not.
