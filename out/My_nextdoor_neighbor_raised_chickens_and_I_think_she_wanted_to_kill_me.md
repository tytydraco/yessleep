After many years in my field of work, I was brought to the rural, and wild, countryside of West Virginia. I purchased a nice two-story home for half the price it would’ve cost in most other places, relieving my wallet and my mind. The house came with 4 acres, most of it being mountainside, but it was nice to know that I could explore and do what I wanted with it, whenever I wanted.

I’m not an avid hiker but I like to now and then, and knowing that I could do so within a few steps of my backdoor was exciting. Owning a large chunk of land was also daunting in that I had no idea how to maintain it, but hey, I’m a smart guy – I could just look up what to do online, right? After living in an overpriced condo in a city for the last ten years, and spending my entire life within city limits, all of this freedom was just a bit overwhelming.

After the movers left and I had unpacked all the essentials, I spent the evening relaxing on my wrap-around porch. The porch went around the front half of the house and was covered. The drizzling rain created a hypnotic tap-tap-tap on the tin roof as I rocked slowly in the wooden swing that had come with the house. The rough old wood creaked as I swayed, and the rain pelted down overheard in a rhythmic beat – it was wonderful.

“I think I’ll like it here.”

Little did I know though.

The next day, I had a Zoom meeting. Luckily, we had cable internet in what the locals call a “holler” because I wasn’t too far from town, but far enough to where I was still isolated. In West Virginia, it's not uncommon to drive not even a mile outside of a city to find yourself in endless wilderness. During the warm months, you are blanketed on all sides by greens and yellows, sometimes so thick in the older thickets, that the sun can’t penetrate through the canopy. It’s like stepping into a time machine and rewinding the clock to the times before humans transformed everything.

After the Zoom meeting, I decided that I would drive by and see the neighbors. I hadn’t been very far beyond my property by then, even when I had flown here to examine the house before buying. I was told the road went back a couple of miles by the realtor. I wanted to see what the neighbors were like. The stereotypes about this part of the United States were untrue from what I had gathered so far. Most people had been very nice and welcoming, unlike what you see in movies.

After a few bends in the road, I was past my property and on to what lay beyond. The neighbors directly after me had a front yard that was a literal junk heap. It was littered with various broken and disused objects – a couple of old rusted-out cars that were missing pieces, a couple of washing machines, also lots of discarded wood and various unrecognizable metallic things, and then, parked at the bottom of the property by the main road, there were the vehicles that I assumed they were still using. These people appeared to be destitute but I was told by the realtor to not let that fool you.

“Some of these people are wealthy because they were raised to be stingy with their money. Our state has never fully recovered from the Great Depression, and some people still live in that waste-not-want-not mindset. They just hoard everything and reuse all that they can, which can save you quite a bit of money. They don’t spend that money unless they absolutely have to.”

An older lady was sitting on the front porch. I waved, but she just glared at me with the icy response of a statue.

“Well, okay then, you cranky hag.”

She continued to glare at me until I came toward a bend that took me out of sight. It creeped me out and gave me a sense that they were probably not as friendly as the other people I had met. Something felt off, and I was right.

The realtor told me that they were named the Fowlers. Further around the property, they had a small farm where they were growing an assortment of vegetables, along with a small barn and what appeared to be a chicken coop and run. I had never seen farm animals in person, so this all seemed foreign, and a little strange, to me.

I found a wide spot to turn around as the “holler” ended at a locked gate. When I drove past the Fowlers’ place again, she was tending to her chickens. She stood up and glared at me again – still not returning my friendly wave.

Note to self: lock the doors at night.

That night was uneventful and pleasant. I sat on the porch again as I ate my hastily made, bachelor’s special of a frozen dinner, heated with the expertise of a chef in my microwave, and a cold beer. As I was eating, I decided that I should get a dog or a cat for company. The house was much larger than my old apartment was, and now that I was a homeowner, I could have all the pets I damned well pleased.

The evening spring rain brought the cool scent of petrichor. I breathed it in as I rocked in my swing, rocking back and forth to the rhythm of the pinging raindrops.

In the distance, I heard a scream echo between the mountains. It was the sound of someone in pure pain and agony.

It rang out once more, and I decided it was a better idea to go inside.

The scream sounded again.

And again.

And again.

I tried my cell phone to call the police, but the reception was spotty in the house. I walked out on the porch but the screams had stopped. The realtor had also told me that some animals make horrifying noises at night and to not be alarmed if I heard anything that I couldn’t explain. I drank another beer, calmed down, and chalked it up to being exactly that. It was difficult to get to sleep but after not hearing another odd sound, I drifted off.

Later on that night, I was awakened from a dead sleep. It took me a few moments for me to gather my bearings, but once I did, I realized it was because of something not normal.

Tap.

Tap.

Tap.

The shrill, harsh sound was from something knocking on my window.

“What the fuck is that?”

I strolled over to the window, naked, because that’s how I like to sleep. If it was some creep who drove to the middle of nowhere to break in, they were about to leave with an eyeful. I threw back the curtains in what I thought was a stealthy way to startle them, but instead of a person, what I saw was a chicken.

The golden little bird stopped pecking, and simply turned its head sideways to look at me. It did normal twitchy head motions as it examined the naked man staring back at it, then simply hopped off the window sill and started walking toward the creek that ran along the front of the property. I watched until the little bird was out of sight, and tried to go back to sleep.

I thought it was an odd experience, but nothing to be frightened about. 

Why would one of the Fowlers’ chickens wander the approximate quarter of a mile distance to my house?

Animals sometimes do their own thing and they usually make zero sense to us humans. Maybe the dumb little bird thought this was their owner's home and was shocked to see a naked stranger answer instead.

Maybe the poor thing was hurt, maybe a wild animal had tried to kill it but it escaped, thinking that my house was safe.

I am not a vet, nor do I have any experience with chickens, so all of this was just hypothetical. Besides, I didn’t think it was any of my business what happened to the Fowlers’ animals. After her cold introduction, I couldn’t care less.

After dwelling on all this for a short while, I was back to blissful sleep again.

Weeks went by with nothing eventful. Spring turned to summer and I had started to feel at home there. I looked up some tutorials online and started a small garden, which only consisted of tomatoes, cucumbers, and corn, to start. By early August, I had already reaped a ton of tomatoes and cucumbers, and the corn was nearly ripe.

One Saturday, I inspected my plants and saw that I had at least a dozen tomatoes that would be fully ripened soon and added that to my mental list. The next day, I did my daily check but this time, they were all gone. In my fenced-in garden were nine chickens having an absolute fucking feast on my hard work.

I was pissed off, of course. I grabbed the nearest implement I could find, which happened to be my plastic yard rake, and swung it wildly at the unwelcome intruders. They cackled and flew, fleeing over my old, rusting fence.

“Get out of here, you motherfuckers! All of you! Go! Go home!”

“Now, that’s not necessary, young man,” a woman’s voice called out from behind me. She had a thick accent, distinct for that region of America. “I’ll get muh girls and head on home. No need to kill ‘em.”

Startled, I stammered, “Oh... I.. I’m sorry. I was just upset that they ate my tomatoes.”

“Oh, that’s just how chickens are. Anything red, they’ll peck at it. If one of ‘em’s injured, they’ll peck it to death and eat it clean to the bones. They’re ruthless little birds.”

She squatted down on her knees and called out, “Come here, girls! Come on, sweet girls!”

They all rushed over to her and began eating food that she had dug out of her dress pocket. The jean skirt was so long that it nearly touched her boots. She had on a floppy, brown gardening hat and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up. She stood up again, revealing her taller-than-average figure to me. “Come on, girls. Let’s go home.”

The chickens all followed her without question and I watched in awe as they all marched down the holler road back around the bend and out of sight.

A week went by. I had another Zoom meeting where I was made aware that they were going to promote me to the vacant position of District Manager. The district in question was the entire state. I could work from home more often and would only occasionally have to leave for meetings, but that would mean a lot more busy work to do during work hours. Getting a pay bump that almost tripled my salary meant all that was fine by me.

I paid a contractor to install a chain link fence around the main part of my yard, in hopes it would keep any curious chickens from barging in again, and I also had a security system installed with twelve cameras. The cameras weren’t because I felt unsafe, but just so I could look around if I were gone. I could’ve sold the place and moved to a nicer piece, but I liked it there for the most part. It felt like home to me.

My sleep was interrupted by the sound of fluttering winds and the pressing weight of something landing on me. As the haze of sleep began to lift, I realized it was a chicken standing on my chest, its head turned to look me in the eyes.

“What the fuck!” I screamed as I flailed to knock the thing off of me. It flew across the room and joined some friends it had brought along.

“How the hell…” that was when I noticed the front door was wide open.

I wondered if I had just forgotten to lock it, but I definitely wouldn’t have just left it open. A figure appeared in the doorway there and glared at me through the darkness of night. It made a cackle noise, an imitation of what chickens sound like, and they all headed toward them. The figure and all the chickens left.

Furious, I jumped up, slammed the door shut, slid the deadbolt into place, and decided the next day I was going to buy a gun and a big dog.

I asked one of my coworkers whom I knew was really into guns, and they told me of a pawn shop nearby. I headed over there and purchased a pump-action shotgun capable of holding eight rounds – if those chickens broke in again, I was going to make soup out of them. As for the dog, I headed over to the county shelter and adopted a big German Shepherd mix named Kodiak. He was immediately friendly to me and the workers told me that his breed was naturally protective. Heading home with my newly acquired safety, I felt good.

A few nights later, I was doing a workout on my exercise bike, with my earbuds playing a horror podcast to occupy the time. Kodiak started going nuts. His insane barking was much louder than my podcast, and in alarm, I jumped off to see what it was. Before I could make it to him, I heard the sounds of an insane fight happening. The distinct sounds of growling and a body being slammed around echoed through the spaces in my home as I rushed to the source.

Once I made it into my living room, I found Kodiak sitting, his mouth a bloody mess as he panted, a decimated corpse of a bird lying next to him. Feathers and viscera were flung all over the damn place, and it dawned on me what it was – a chicken.

“Shit! Great! Now the chicken lady is going to be pissed at me.”

I had no idea how pissed she was going to be.

Things were quiet for a while – no chickens, no weird hillbilly lady. I felt peace for the first time since moving in. It stayed that way, until one day when I was in the middle of a Zoom meeting when Kodiak walked in with a dead chicken hanging from his mouth.

“Jesus Christ! Where did you get that?”

Kodiak’s ears lowered, as if embarrassed at my scolding him.

He dropped the limp, black-colored chicken and sat on his haunches.

I started at the dead thing, trying to decide what to do with it.

Eating it seemed… wrong, somehow. The only reasonable option I had was to bury it. I couldn’t return it to Mrs. Fowler or she might burst a gasket. That lady seemed unhinged – it’s hard to say what type of vengeance she would seek for one of her precious chickens.

I climbed the hill a short distance, I decided that there was where I’d dig the hole. After a few minutes, I thought I had a reasonably deep enough grave for its size. I threw the carcass in, decided to say the Lord’s Prayer, and then fill it back in with earth.

That night, I was once again startled from sleep, but this time, it was the sound of a Kodiak crying for his life. I had been keeping the shotgun on a rack in the living room. After racking a round, I darted outside.

It was completely black outside the range of my motion-activated light. I didn't need to see outside there, though, because in the center lay Kodiak dead with over a dozen blood-covered chickens feasting on him. On the border between the light and darkness, I saw a figure stand and step into the light. They were feasting on a piece of my dog, their face was a bloody, horrifying mess as they pecked away at his carcass until I snapped out of my frozen state of horror. Mrs. Fowler never broke eye contact as she gnawed on the raw flesh of Kodiak. Her face only changed when she stopped chewing for a few moments to smile, her teeth glistened wet crimson in the faint illumination of the LED light. The message was crystal clear – she wanted me to know who was in charge around here.

The next day, I called the realtor back and put the place back on the market. There was no chance I was spending another night next to that psycho. You’re probably thinking this, but yes, I did call the police. When they came out to look at the footage, my cameras were all ripped off their mounts and my laptop was gone. They wrote up a report and I never heard another word. My lawyer told me there wasn’t much I could do without any evidence.

“We need something to say for certain that it was her. I’m sorry about your dog, and that story is pretty messed up, but in a court of law, we need proof.”

A month later, I was living in a new home halfway across the state. This time, I have two German Shepherds and no chicken-crazed neighbors. I paid an exorbitant amount of money to fence in a half-acre of the land surrounding my home and I now own a small arsenal of weapons – knives, swords, guns, anything really to stop an intruder.

As for Kodiak, I had his remains cremated. It felt wrong to bury him on that property so close to that psycho and her birds. His remains sit on my mantle above the fireplace in a nice urn with a picture of him placed in the center. Whenever I walk past him, I pat him, for old time’s sake.

As I sit here writing this, I have been trying to eat a dinner that I received from one of those meal kits I heard about on a podcast. The meals are nice and all, but I have one problem. I’ve eaten every ounce of this meal, except the chicken.

So, yeah, in case you’re wondering – I hate chickens.
