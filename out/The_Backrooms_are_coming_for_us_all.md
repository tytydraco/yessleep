Look down at your hands. Now, look up at the ceiling or sky above you. Finally, take a deep breath and remember that you're still as real as you can be. You exist in this reality; you can breathe, think, and love. In a distant place called the Backrooms, there is a vast array of entities who seek what you take for granted. I'm lucky to be here today, talking to you all. I came here to warn you for the pending end, the Backrooms are coming for us all.

For as long as I could  remember, my childhood was filled with moments of gazing into the vast expanse of our world. Everything fascinated me, from the tiniest hummingbird flitting by to the sight of massive feral pigs racing across my family's ranch. The world seemed boundless and vibrant, and nothing could derail my joy. 

However, as I grew older I began to realize that while I had spent much time pondering and observing, I hadn't achieved much for myself. Through relentless pursuit of success, I eventually saved enough money to attend a university out of state. Now, at 21 years old and well into my university studies on the path to becoming an accountant, everything seemed to be unfolding according to plan. Yet, amidst this journey, I began to question: what comes next?
During a plane ride home to visit my family for the holidays, I found myself lost in thought, deeply questioning the underlying curiosities that had resurfaced within me. These thoughts and struggles seemed to assail me with the same intensity I had once worked to suppress. 

For hours on end, I grappled with the eternal battle within my psyche, feeling as though my own mind had become foreign territory. Despite the internal turmoil, I managed to conceal these inner struggles, maintaining composure until I finally arrived home to reunite with my family, who I hadn't seen in over seven months.

Sitting by, waiting for my mother and older sister to pick me up from the airport, I admired the sunset. Its warm hues painted the sky like a canvas of nostalgia over my hometown, Austin, Texas. Memories flooded back; each building and street corner held a piece of my past.

Before I could delve deeper into my thoughts, I heard a familiar, passionate call of my name.
"Kyle! Let's go home!" my older sister, Hannah, exclaimed, her voice cutting through the nostalgic haze.

"Long time no see, sis! You look just as ugly as you did seven months ago," I joked as I greeted her.
"And you look just as nerdy as you did when you decided to study to be an accountant. I mean, come on, an accounting degree? Total dork!" Hannah retorted with a playful grin.

We left the airport, the three of us—my mother, Hannah, and I—catching up on the usual topics. We discussed everything from the latest election polls to the ongoing global crises around the world. Of course, we got into heated debates, as these topics often lead to, but we managed to keep everything toned down enough to make it to the mall without driving the car off a bridge. Haha, just kidding. (Or am I?)

"Kyle, we haven't been to this mall since we were kids. How much do you think has changed?" Hannah asked inquisitively.

"I mean, you know after the early 2000s, they pushed to modernize everything. Just look at poor Taco Bell's new logo—what a shame."

"At least it wasn't as bad as McDonald's! That place got hit the worst with the modernization marketing. What a lame world we live in now, little bro."

Hannah and I walked through the ancient doors we remembered from our distant childhood. Surprisingly, not much had changed. We felt a warm blanket of nostalgia as we gazed around, curious to see if anything was new. We went through our usual routine of scanning all the stores, not really buying anything but food (window shopping).
“Kyle help!” Hannah screamed for assistance
As I turned to see what was going on with my sister I saw her struggling to rise to her feet, she was stuck in a sort of paralysis. She hadn’t had any medical issues in her past so I assumed the worst, was my Sister experiencing some sort of heart attack?

“Hannah, put your wrist out for me, let me try to see if I can feel a pulse.” 

Luckily she was just fine, she had probably just experienced some sort of anxiety attack that she didn’t want to talk to me about, or so I thought. 
"Kyle, that was really weird. I just went for a checkup a couple of weeks ago and was completely healthy. What's going on with me?"

I managed to calm her down and suggested that she might have experienced some sort of anxiety attack, possibly as a coping mechanism for stress she hadn't acknowledged. She seemed to agree with me, regained her composure, and we continued walking around the mall, looking for something new.

"Kyle, there's something about this place that screams the 1990s—the colorful era, as I like to call it!" Hannah remarked.

"You're definitely onto something. It's like they didn't put any money into modernizing this place, yet it still seems to be running just fine, with plenty of people coming through," I responded.

Before we could delve deeper into our discussion about the mall's aesthetic appeal, the intercom crackled to life.

"Attention, ladies and gentlemen: Please exit the mall through all available doors. We are experiencing a water leakage, and it is imperative that we do not put our customers in harm's way. We will resume our normal schedule tomorrow at 11 a.m. Thank you for coming, and have a blessed rest of your day."
As Hannah and I headed toward the exit, we saw dozens of men in hazmat suits rushing in with the urgency that could only be replicated by a worried mother.

"I bet they love hyping each other up, running into the mall like their jobs are that important," Hannah humorously remarked.

"I know, right? How bad could it actually be?"

"Wait, hold on, this doesn't make sense. A water leakage, but hazmat suits? Come on, that doesn't add up. What aren't they telling us?" Hannah wondered aloud.

"Yeah, Hannah, it's probably something else, but they likely don't want to cause a panic."

"Screw it, Kyle, let's stay and see what they're up to."

"Absolutely not! They have hazmat suits on for a reason; it’s probably some kind of gas leak."

"Suit yourself!"


Hannah then started sneaking around, using every pillar and pole she could find to avoid detection. She was determined to figure out what was really going on, and I couldn’t just stand around and let her go alone. The coward in me wanted to run for the exit and hope for the best, but you know the saying—the coward in you rewards you with comfort but denies you peace. I wasn’t going to regret anything.
“Kyle, I see those men in hazmat suits circling around something in the food court. I can't just quite see what it is..” 

Before I could muster up a response, a vibration shook the ground beneath us, almost causing Hannah and me to collapse. We both looked around desperately, trying to find the source of the earth-shaking eruption we had just experienced. But as we scanned our surroundings, we realized that everything had almost entirely changed. We were in the same place, but it felt like a different time. The color scheme was reminiscent of the late 1980s or early 1990s, with bright colors far from the blandness of modern design.

"Hannah... are you seeing what I'm seeing, or am I going batshit crazy?" I asked nervously.

"Kyle, I think you were right. Maybe there's a gas leak and we're just hallucinating," Hannah suggested, trying to hold onto reality.

"Well, if you see that exact same red carpet over to your left, then we're seeing the same thing. Meaning we couldn't possibly be hallucinating the same thing, right? Right?!" I tried to reason.

As brave as Hannah had been in leading us into this situation, she quickly began to panic in a way that I hadn't seen since our father left us when we were younger. She started to weep, overwhelmed by fear.
"Look, Hannah, just follow me, and we'll figure out what's really going on, okay?" I assured her
I myself wanted to scream to the top of my lungs in disbelief of what I couldn’t explain, but the sight of my older sister in that state gave me the strength to withhold my own anxieties until she was safe again.

 We began to walk around still seeing aged concepts signaling we were in a different time, a different place entirely,  not a human left in sight. I kept assuring myself that I had passed out from a gas leakage and this was all just a weird dream, just a dream to pass the time until paramedics could get to me inside of the mall. Although deep down in my consciousness I knew I was awake, I could all too well feel my sensations. I knew I was awake experiencing this, it was just too much to come to terms with.
 
“Kyle,  are we going to be okay, let’s just maybe try to use our phones? Make a call?” Hannah pointed out.

As we both tried to make phone calls to our mother our phones automatically were unable to perform the task. This confirmed our suspicions of being in an entirely different place. I kept going down a rabbit hole of theories on what could possibly be going on. Before I could start to actually get a grasp on the situation at hand, Hannah interrupted me. 
“This has to be the Backrooms… a place where the world is empty outside of the individuals who get unlikely enough to noclip in.” Hannah struggled to grasp the idea. 

“I guess creepypasta’s had some more underlying details then anyone could’ve imagined. Though this can’t be some childish idea. I don’t think we’re in some other universe. Maybe this is just some type of simulation experiment? Maybe somehow, someway we are just a part of some sick experiment?” I tried to reason with whatever I could possibly muster up to make sense of this nightmarish realm.
 
How could you expect any two saine individuals to carry on after they were ripped from everything they’ve known? We weren’t home, we weren’t near our home, our place of comfort. Though, for some odd reason me and my sister were filled with the same passion to make it through the unknown and the possibility of death itself. As we carried on we started to notice the mall in a different light, one filled with those now nonexistent colorful plethoras. We were definitely transported to a different time, a different place. 

“Mickey mouse looks a-lot younger” Hannah fixed her gaze at the Disney store's old shimmering glow.
“There’s some magic lost in the past, huh old sis?” I genuinely felt depressed as I remembered our present time Disney store being so damp and gray.
“We were the last of it little bro.” Hannah gazed at me with a warm smile.

Hannah insisted that we took a souvenir home in remembrance for whatever the fuck we were currently going through. Although I highly contested this notion because I didn’t even know if me and Hannah truly existed in this time and space. I didn’t want to keep questioning our situation and I know she didn’t too. All we had was each other and it was best if we kept distracting ourselves from our pending end.
 
“Kyle… stop breathing so loud and just crouch down.” Hannah anxiously demanded. 
At those words, adrenaline spiked through my system, sending vibrations through every fiber of my being. I looked in every direction, trying to detect a threat, but there was none. I gave Hannah a questioning look, and she responded.

"Kyle, don't freak out, but I swear I saw something moving inside the Disney store. It was subtle but noticeable. Just wait this out with me; we can't be the only ones here, right?"

I kept my gaze fixed on the entrance to the Disney store and began to notice subtle movements as well. Then, for what felt like minutes, there was nothing—no movement at all. Just as I signaled Hannah to follow my lead and leave the area, an eerie, slowed Mickey Mouse voice said, "H-Hey everybody! It's me, Mickey Mouse!" The voice was raspy and distorted, as if whatever entity was trying to replicate Mickey Mouse's friendly tone couldn't quite manage it.

As Hannah and I tried to make sense of the unexpected outburst, a dark humanoid figure began rushing toward us. It was then that we realized it was a 2-foot disfigured version of Mickey Mouse, repeating his famous phrase, "H-Hey everybody! It's me, Mickey Mouse!" The voice sounded less and less human with each repetition.

We were so paralyzed with fear and disgust that we couldn't even scream. It was as if we had reached a level of terror beyond the ability to cry out. We felt like we were on the brink of self-destruction. What would you have done? Tell me, because I hate remembering what that felt like. For many of you, this might seem like some kind of sick joke, but I assure you, what we experienced in that moment aged us twenty years from the sheer horror.

We ran! We ran until we reached the escalators. As we were running up, Hannah tripped and fell a few steps down. I yelled and screamed for her to get up, but the overwhelming fear made me briefly black out. When I came to, I found Hannah struggling to carry me over her shoulder. She managed to find a Starbucks where we could take refuge. Although something seemed different about her, it was as if she somehow obtained a level of confidence that was alien in nature to who she truly is. Nonetheless I appreciated her ability to keep calmer I could have in those moments.
 
"Hannah, we don't know exactly what's going on, but we've fallen into something—another realm of some sort, maybe the Backrooms? Whatever happened, it doesn't matter now. There's a number one rule about falling into something: if there's a way in, there's a way out." I felt hope rising through my chest, filling me with confidence. We had to leave this place, and I wasn't going to let my mind succumb to the same void my body currently inhabited.

"Falling into something? Or maybe, draining the pool of water—there’s a plug somewhere to release this place back into nothingness. Little bro, this is about to get very interesting." Hannah shared my determination; it was time to escape the Backrooms.

We made our way to the food court, searching for any possible escape. The food court, often the center of most malls and a significant attraction, seemed like a logical place to start. As we hurried around looking for clues to bring us back to our reality, something at the McDonald's caught my attention. An all-too-familiar voice spoke up.

"We love to see you smile," said the one and only Ronald McDonald, rising from behind the counter with a charismatic tone.

"We're kind of lost, sir. Is there any way you can help us get back home?" It was unsettling, but the only thing my brain could muster up in the presence of that clown was a request for help. Seriously, what was I thinking?

"Leave? What? You just came! Come on and stay! There's no rush; you have eternity to decide when you want to go back." Ronald McDonald still had that caring, characteristic voice, but his presence was eerie. He had been a childhood nightmare that I couldn't get over for a long time.

"No, listen, Mr. Ronald, we have to get home. We have very important people waiting for us on the other side," I struggled to say.

"And I was important to all of you kids when I was younger, but now I'm just a distant memory, a past tale that you adults joke about." His tone shifted to one of genuine disdain.

"Hey, listen. To me and my sister here, you've always been something we talked about from time to time. You never truly faded away; you live on in many adult memories. Okay?" I hoped to ease his apparent sadness.

“You all aren’t happy; none of you are. Just like me, you’re trapped in your own independent realities, tormented by what used to be and what could have been. I don’t think you’ll be leaving anytime soon. You will stay with me—and your sister over there.” Hannah started to slowly crouch down, plotting an escape.

“Look, Mr. Ronald, what could you possibly gain from us? Two young and foolish adults with nothing to offer?” I tried to reason with him.

“It’s not what you can offer me; it’s what you can offer us all.” As he spoke, dozens of entities, including Mickey, began to morph into tall, slender humanoid creatures, screaming in high-pitched tones. It was clear now that these beings were only masquerading as childhood mascots to lure us into a trap. They began emerging from every possible hiding spot—behind pillars, rising out of concession stands. It felt like Hannah and I had reached our last straw until a man’s voice shouted, “Grab whatever you can to stop them, but don’t move too far from your spot!”

Hannah and I turned to see one of the men we’d first seen rushing into the mall, now in a hazmat suit. He was armed with what appeared to be a military-grade weapon, an M-16. We realized we weren’t the only ones dragged into this nightmare. We grabbed whatever we could use as weapons and began to fight off the entities. We managed to daze a few and saw our new ally in the hazmat suit reduce many of them to chunks of goo.

The food court erupted into chaos, with screams that felt like they could shatter windows from miles away. The entities seemed desperate, as if we were part of some plan to return them to their origins. Their screams weren’t just out of anger; they were filled with desperation and fear. Like us, they wanted to become someone or something again, in a different time and place. But there was no time to ponder the fate of these beings. The unknown man in the hazmat suit created enough of a distraction to make an escape route possible.We ran as fast as we could and managed to hide in a janitor's closet with the unknown man. He removed his helmet and greeted us casually.

“Hey, the name’s Adrian. Sorry you got dragged into this, but we’re working on an escape route. Just hang tight.” Adrian spoke as if this was just another day on the job; he clearly had experience with this.

“You’re telling me there are more of you? First, where are we? Who are you? And am I fucking dead?” I lost my cool at this point, hyperventilating and crying. At that moment, I wished I had never existed because existence felt far more terrifying than nothing at all.

“Kid, piece of advice-when you don’t have any other choice but to be strong, do it or you’ll for sure be dead, okay?” Adrian’s voice sent a mellow sense of relief that I haven’t felt yet in that god forsaken realm. Whoever he was, he was truly a character, one that needed to be studied for his ability to not give a fuck.
 
“You two need to listen up; we don’t have much time, okay? I’m not going to repeat myself. We technically don’t exist right now. We’ve fallen into a parallel universe where what we consider souls inhabit. From our realm or another, it doesn’t matter; they exist here. Every piece of land, place, or thing in this universe has its twisted copy, and we’re standing in one of them. I’m not sure how entities get stuck here or why it happens, but if we don’t return to our reality, we’ll be erased. Not erased in the sense that no one will remember us, but in the sense that there will be no evidence of our disappearance. People won’t know where we went or how to bring us back. My theory is that we’ll eventually turn into one of those entities if we stick around too long.”

“Adrian, you’re saying the Backrooms are real? Is this some kind of purgatory for souls? Or maybe a holding place for judgment? Some religious theories might help us understand,” Hannah said with a hopeful smile, always good at seeing the bright side of things.

“There’s a lot more to my company and humanity as a whole that I can’t delve into right now due to our limited time. Let’s just say there are many key components missing in that broad statement of mine. Just remember, your objective is to leave this place and forget it as it is. If I don’t make it out with you, prioritize forgetting you were ever here.”

“There is a way out, kids; it’s called the point of singularity. Think of a black hole and how everything folds into it, vanishing into who knows what—basically leading to another point in space and time. I’m not saying there’s a literal black hole here, but there’s a point where we could potentially fall back into our universe.”

“Where would this singularity point be?” I asked, determined to make it my mission to leave.

“Unfortunately, this is the hard part. We’re currently in a complex that’s around 400,000 square feet. We need to find the singular space or area in this mall that radiates the most nostalgic, vibrant colors—essentially, the most active part of this purgatory.”

“What happens if we get killed by one of those entities? Or worse, captured?” Hannah asked instinctively.

“Honey, focus on the goal. Like I told your brother, when you’re in trouble, you’re in trouble. There’s no time for anxiety. Hannah, Kyle, follow me slowly and quietly as we exit our hiding place. We need to enter the main hallway, moving cautiously to find the most vibrant part of this mall. Whatever you do, don’t scream; it will only attract more of them. Keep your eyes on the prize—freedom.”

We slowly emerged from our hiding spot and began making our way down the hallway, carefully observing our surroundings. This was the endgame we faced: finding the most vibrant atmosphere in the mall.

“Something is alluring about this place, punch me if I’m crazy but a part of me doesn’t want to leave. Something feels so warm inside, something that I’ve been missing for some time.” I said casually without thinking too deeply about it. 

Adrian then quickly turned around tackling me to the ground restraining my hands and legs. I couldn’t help but scream out for help, hoping my sister would come to my defense. And as expected she quickly jumped on top of Adrian’s back punching him with all of the force her little frame could possibly muster up. 

Hannah, stop! Your brother is drifting away. I’ve seen this before. We have no choice but to restrain him! If you love your brother, help me do this before he loses his mind and decides to stay here, engulfed by whatever this place is.”

Their arguing was a blur to me. I felt trapped in a state of consciousness where I could only grasp one thing—warmth. I needed it. No one was going to stop me. This place had finally provided me with what I needed to fill the gaping hole in my soul. A bright melody started playing nearby, and I rose to my feet, running towards it with a passion and desire beyond words. The emotions and ideas I experienced in this place were beyond anything I could describe.

As I moved steadily towards the sound, I heard distant calls for me to come back. A small part of my soul was screaming at me to stop, trying to remind me that beautiful things aren’t perfect. But in that state of mind, I felt perfect. I was willing to let the world burn for it. I reached a Build-A-Bear store where the beautiful melody originated. There, I saw it—a young child smiling at me. Upon closer inspection, I realized it was a childhood version of myself. A spike of adrenaline brought me back to reality.

“How can I help you, buddy?” I asked shakily.

“Can you help me build a bear? I really want one!” the child replied.

Trembling, I walked towards this younger version of myself. There’s a saying that if you see an exact replica of yourself, you wouldn’t recognize it. I’m here to tell you that’s false; I knew exactly who it was and what it represented. Before I could think of running away, my childhood self laid a hand on my chest and said, “Where deep waters are is where light dives to rescue.” It was a saying my late father used to tell me, meaning that no matter how dark or hard life gets, the greater good will come to rescue you. I broke down into tears, astonished that this entity knew something so significant to me.
“You see, big me, I’m the light that dove to find you. You can stay here with me for eternity and finally be saved!” my childhood version said.

I was conflicted, feeling my sense of reality slip away, until I heard gunfire from behind. I turned to see Adrian and Hannah. Their presence grounded me. I ran towards them as my childhood version screamed and cried in a demonic rage.

“Don’t leave me here! I need to see the other side! I once had a life too!” my childhood self pleaded, but saving these entities wasn’t our responsibility. They were here for a reason.

“Hannah, Kyle, there’s a stairwell coming up. Go down it and keep left. That’s where we might fall back into our world. Just remember, these entities will make one final push to keep us here. Grab whatever weapon you can find. My ammunition is running low.” Adrian gave his final order.

As Hannah and I approached the epicenter of this world, we saw hundreds of thousands of entities screaming at us to stay and enjoy the paradise they had created. They aimed to destroy our souls, a danger we knew all too well. They lunged and screamed to get to us, but luckily, Hannah and I were just a few feet from the point of singularity. You may be wondering what happened to Adrian. Well, he yelled at us to keep moving forward, repeating, “I’ve got some more work to do, forget, forget, forget.” 

As he had mentioned earlier, he wanted us to forget ever coming to this hellish dimension. He knew that we didn’t belong in his world of chaos and mystery. Adrian is a man who bore the burden of saving two young adults from becoming trapped entities in a dimension that can only be described as the Backrooms. I will forever thank him for his help, though I need it now more than ever. Hannah and I woke up in a hospital room surrounded by our mother, who was crying, saying we had been exposed to chemical poisoning from a gas leak inside the mall. 

Hannah and I shared a knowing look, understanding all too well what had truly occurred.
That night, we went home and discussed our experience in the Backrooms. We finally sat down and thoroughly examined the situation we had just experienced, how real it had been. We knew that our passing out from poisonous chemicals was just a cover-up by the corporation dealing with the Backrooms. We laughed and giggled about some of the things we liked most about the Backrooms, and then Hannah said, “Who knew Mickey Mouse could make a full-grown man like yourself pass out, haha. My little bro has been downgraded from a dork to a dweeb.”

 Hannah said sarcastically. I laughed and felt a sense of relief that it was all over. As I picked up a glass of water and slowly drank, Hannah spoke again, but now in a demonic voice: “What could have been can still always be. What should be now is still here. Don’t forget where you’re gonna stay.” She, or "it," then walked away with a grin that could only be described as euphoric satisfaction in itself.

I ran to my room trying to put this puzzle piece together, how could I or Adrian not have known that Hannah got drifted away, replaced by a masquerading entity? She helped me escape my own nightmarish state. I physically saw her fall right back into our home dimension. Then it hit me, I had passed out for a brief period of time waking up in a Starbucks hiding with Hannah. In that brief period of time she must’ve lost her free will and decided to allow herself to get mimicked to the touch allowing this imposter to take control over my sister's image. 

I write to you now, hoping and praying someone can help me navigate through this situation. I'm desperately gasping for air every few seconds. I’m not free; I’m trapped by the idea that my sister is still in a faraway land, alone and scared, or, worse yet, dead. I can’t fathom that idea. Help me! I don’t know what followed me back home, but it’s been knocking at my door all night. I might not make it past tonight, so I write to warn you all: the Backrooms and all of its entities are coming for us all.
