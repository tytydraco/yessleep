I was sitting on the balcony looking through my binoculars when I heard my roommate come home from work. 

“Aaron?” I yelled through the screen door. I waited a moment. The silence began to panic me the longer it pressed on. I put the lens caps on and set down the ‘nocs and quickly jotted something in my notebook.

“…Aaron…?” I called out a little quieter now, just beginning to rise to my feet. 

“Yo.” He says as he slides the screen door open and steps out on the balcony with me. He pulls out a spliff and lights it in the shelter of his palm before plopping down in the chair beside me. 

“How was work?” I asked, while removing the caps off the binoculars again. 

“Same shit, different day. How’s the job hunt?” he asked as he exhalated a bitter cloud. Maybe the cloud wasn’t bitter. Maybe it’s just me. 

“Fuck I hate that question. It’s fine. Look at this.” I passed the binoculars to him and pointed at the horizon. His joint dangled off his lip while he peered through. 

“What am I supposed to be seeing?” he asked before the cherry at the end of his smoke lit up and smoke slowly rose from the corners of his mouth.

“The fog! It’s sunny here, but all foggy near the horizon. Why is it always foggy out there?” I snatched his joint and took a long draw to try calm my nerves.

“So…? It’s just fog.” He handed the ‘nocs to me and took his smoke back. 

I looked through again. “Yesterday and the day before… can you remember it NOT being foggy in the distance?”.

“I’m sure it’s just been lately. It doesn’t mean anything. Don’t read into shit. No offense man, but you’re getting all neurotic from being cooped up at home so much lately.” He said, with what I believe to be genuine concern for my well-being. 

“Let’s get some rotis” Aaron said as he snuffed the butt on the leg of the chair and rose to his feet. 

“Okay sure.” I capped the lenses again.

The fresh air did calm me a little, I guess. Aaron was inside ordering for us while I lingered by the entrance on the sidewalk. Arms crossed and staring like a weirdo at the people waiting at the bus stop on the other side of the road. I must have looked like a tweaker for sure, since I don’t think I was blinking much at all. 

“Here.” A voice said, and I must have jumped out of my skin for a second. 

“Jesus, calm down. Here.” Aaron handed me my shawarma and said “You can pay me back when you land something, don’t worry. I’ve been there.”

“I thought it was rotis?” I said, opening the wrapping.

“What?” He replied, opening his as well.

“Nevermind.” I muttered. 

“What were you staring at?” he asked and took a big bite of his food and looked towards the bus stop people.

“Those people there waiting, I think two of them have synced up.” I said, not taking a bite yet - fixated on the people. 

“Synced up?” He laughed with his mouth full.

“I’m not joking, just watch. In a couple seconds they’ll take a sip of their coffee. I think their… loop like, happened to sync up.” I said, and we both paused for a moment to watch. Two of the five people waiting for the bus took a sip of coffee at the same time.

“There! See!” I gestured frantically with my shawarma hand, flinging bits onto the sidewalk.

“That two people drank coffee? Three of those people have a cup in their hand. So chances are pretty high that they’d happen to take a sip at the same time.” Aaron says with what I believe to be, mild sass. 

“No, man. Look! They shift their weight to the other leg at the same time, turn their heads a little… just watch!” I said, probably squeezing the shawarma a little too tight.

“Do you hear yourself? Jesus. Come on.” He said as he began walking in the direction of a park that we saw on our way here. We ended up passing closer by the bus stop people on our way, and I don’t know when it happened… but the two people were no longer in sync. 

We sat on a bench with a nice view of the park. An elderly couple pass by while I dig into my food. For a little while we just eat in silence and enjoy each others company. Aaron has been my friend since high school, so he has a lot of patience for me, but I think I’ve been annoying him lately. 

I look up through the leaves at the beams of sunshine. “Why is it always sunny?” I say with my mouth full. 

“Now you’re going to complain about pleasant weather?” he said, a little exasperated with my bullshit. 

“No, I just mean, it’s never like… overcast or rainy, it’s just always a… nice day” I muttered, maybe hearing a little of how stupid this sounds. 

“Dude, I think it rained like a week or two ago.” he said.

“It didn’t.” I said firmly, averting my eyes. Eye contact was always kind of difficult for me, but right now I just know he’s making a face like I’m a hopeless nutjob and I can’t bear to see it. After a few quiet moments, he stands up.

“Look, I gotta grab more weed. Wanna come to the head shop with me before we go back?” he says, zipping up his jacket the rest of the way. I followed along, hunching against the chilly wind.

“I know I sound crazy, but I’ve been taking notes lately to keep it all straight, and I’m starting to see weird patterns.” I pulled out my small notebook and turned through to one of the middle pages while speeding my walk to catch up with him.

“I’ll bite, okay? What patterns?” he says, politely entertaining me as we approach the door.

“Okay here, before we head in, look at this.” I pointed at my notebook. “The staff will say only one of three responses to the transaction, and nothing else. Unless, of course, prompted.”

“Of course.” he says sarcastically before reading:

3 CUSTOMER SERVICE RESPONSES

“Thank you, have a great day.”

“Thanks, take care.”

“Cheers, have a good one.”

Aaron looks from the notes to me, in disbelief. “These are very normal things to say, man. You’re reeeally reading way too into shit.”

“Ugh! Come on.” I open the door to the shop and he goes in first. I follow and put my hands in my pockets, anxiously tapping my thumb on my hip. I always keep my hands in my pockets in stores because I’m scared that they’ll think I’m stealing or something. Aaron picks out a half-ounce and pays at the register. The girl smiles and says “Thanks, take care.” and my eyes bug out at Aaron. He doesn’t seem surprised and just casually heads for the door. 

“See!?” I whisper-yell as we leave. “She said the thing! I told you, only one of the three things!” 

Aaron sighed dramatically and said that it was a normal thing for her to say, and that there’s only so many things customer service can say to you when you leave. I don’t think he gets it. I don’t know why it’s so important to me that he gets it. I guess if he believes me, and understands, then I won’t feel so crazy… or something. I don’t know. I’ll apply for some jobs tomorrow.

I slept in, again, so Aaron has already long since left for work. The weirdest thing happened. It rained. I honestly gasped when I woke up and heard it. I ran to the balcony and there it was! Rain! I was going to look at job ads, but I couldn’t help myself. I sat out on the balcony again, binoculars in hands, just… watching people. Time flies when you’re being a fuckin’ creep I guess, because Aaron was home again before I knew it. He set his umbrella leaning against the chair on the balcony to dry.

“Yo.” He plopped down in the chair next to me and started fiddling with his grinder.

I raise the binoculars again. “Okay so, hear me out. But there are only five different kinds of dogs.”

“What the fuck are you even on about?” he said.

“LOOK! There are only five fucking dogs, they’re all just… repeats of those dogs. There are no other dogs Aaron, just the five! I took pictures this time, so you can’t say I’m making it up!” I thrusted my phone into his hands and swiped again and again.

“Jack Russel, see the red collar? Golden, Poodle, Black Labrador, Chihuahua … another Jack Russel, with the same red collar! Golden, Chihuahua… It’s just the same ones, over and over. There are no others!” I said, probably hysterically. “If there are only fives kinds of dogs ever around, and only the three customer service responses… maybe there’s a pattern? Like these numbers maybe mean something?” I pleaded for him to understand. He just shoved the phone back into my hands. 

“You seriously need to get a fucking job, I can’t pay for all this shit on my own. You’re losing your fuckin’

marbles. I don’t know what to tell you, dude. Like, look in front of you. It’s raining. And just yesterday you were bitching about how it never rained. Are you going to reconsider, or is this somehow further proof of some crazy conspiracy?” he said, shaking his head while rolling a joint and licking the papers to seal it. 

I was pissed. Conspiracy?! Like I’m some ‘jet fuel can’t melt steel beams’ wacko. This is real! Or rather, it isn’t. Something is fucky and I am done hearing him doubt all my proof at every turn. I stood up and yelled. “It only rained after I talk to YOU about how it never rained. You don’t even own an umbrella! Where the fuck did the umbrella come from, Aaron!?”.

He furrowed his brow at me. He probably would have stood up too if he didn’t have his rolling tray on his lap.

“Maybe I bought one while I was out!” he yelled back.

“Maybe?! Did you, or didn’t you? Do you even know? Where do you even go during the day? Where do you even work?!” I threw my hand up in a vague gesture to the city. 

“You know what? I’ve put up with your shit long enough, I’m not going to carry your ass through life. You’re out by the end of the month, I’m fucking done with this shit.” He lit up his joint and wouldn’t even look at me. 

I know I’m getting close to something. I feel it in my bones. I left the apartment and slammed the door on my way out. Fuck Aaron, he doesn’t see the patterns right in front of his face. Everything seems to get more… complex as I get closer, and simpler when further away. It’s like the detail of… reality follows me. That must be it! I got in my car and started driving toward the highway. I’ve been out of the city before, but what if…

As I merged onto the highway, I slowly began putting the pedal to the floor. The engine roared and geared up, and the little needle on the speed indicator slowly leaned further and further to the right. Cars I passed whizzed by. The houses whizzed by. Bicyclists on the shoulder whizzed by. As I started to reach top speed, the highway felt more open. Fewer cars were on the road. My toes felt numb with how hard I was pushing the pedal down. I’m so close to something. A distinct lonely feeling started to set in, and I realized that there were fewer houses, and more rolling green hills. I was fixated on the hills, as they were so bare. It’s like a default Windows wallpaper. I look around both sides and confirm that there are no other cars on the road, no pedestrians on bikes. No trees. No houses to whizz by. I lean in and squint at the rolling hills and it feels like… there are no grass blades. It’s just green…dirt. I fucking did it. I was right. Holy shit I was right. I pull my foot up to release some pressure on the gas and the engine quiets just a little. As I slow down, I can make out grass blades now. A farm house is on the hill, and even has some trees on the property. Despite not further accelerating, the car was still flying down the road pretty fast, fast enough to wrap almost entirely around a tree that seemed to appear out of nowhere. I guess I’ve veered onto the shoulder of the highway a bit more than I thought. I can hear birds. And cars. Cars pulling over and I hear someone shouting to call 911. A crowd forms around the wreckage of my car as my vision fades. I swear that tree wasn’t there a moment ago.
