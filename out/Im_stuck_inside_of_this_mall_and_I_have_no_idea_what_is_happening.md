I obviously didn't foresee this happening. All I was doing was going to the mall with some friends. Then, out of the blue, there's a huge goddamn explosion. What the hell?

I get myself up off of the ground. I was extremely disoriented, and what was once a light-filled lively food court was now a destroyed, dark hell scape. It wasn't any better outside of the food court either. The large walkway with stores on either side was in ruins too. There must've been multiple explosions. Once I gathered my thoughts, my head says, "Shit, where are Aaron and Travis?" From the looks of it, l'm the only one in the food court. I charge forward to the walkway. Once I get out there though, it's worse than I thought. Everything is destroyed. But I'm not given any time to focus on that. I hear a large clanking noise from inside of a smaller clothes store. I start walking over to investigate it. Suddenly, a gargantuan, dark creature of some sort, probably ten feet tall, jumps out of the store and rams into the wall on the other side of the walkway.

I don’t stay to find out what it is. I scream *"Shit!"* and bolt the other way. The thing makes a loud shrieking noise and I start running faster. Faster than I've ever ran. Once I think I've lost the thing, I dive into an electronics store. I get up and move toward the back of the store, away from the entrance to whatever godforsaken things are happening outside of here. I walk behind the counter and jolt back. There’s a body laying on the floor. It’s severely scratched all over its left side. There’s a name tag on the shirt. Jim. I kneel down to try to wake him up, to no avail. I sigh and get back up. I think for a minute and decide to try and leave again. I run out of the store, towards were I remember coming in. I run through the atrium of the mall, now covered in glass shards, and look up through the skylight, seeing the blue sky. I keep going to the exit. There's a huge area of debris covering it. I move towards it, when another one of those creatures drops down from above. God damn it! I run back again, but this time it's relentless. I run back to the atrium and grab a shard of glass. As it jumps towards me, I slice through the crumply flesh on it's abdomen. It spurts out this dark purple liquid and falls to the ground with a shriek. It's still alive, though. It crawls towards me, clawing at my shoes. I slam the shard into the back of it's neck, and it shrieks again and drops down. I stand there watching the purple liquid come out of it's neck. I realize that at this point, using a conventional exit to leave isn't an option. I look up to the skylight. That seems like a viable option, but I have no idea how I'd get up there.

Gonna have to find a way somehow.
