Ok, so I know doing the *Listening Ritual*  is a bad idea but, I couldn’t stop thinking about the book with the spiral. The memory of the thing I’d seen in the mirror haunted me, but the *Listening Ritual* promised something different. “To hear the truths between the cracks,” the book said. Truths. Answers. Maybe, if I performed the ritual, I could figure out what to do about the entity and learn what was going on in that hidden room in the basement.

The instructions were simple. I needed three things: a clock that ticks, a needle, and a quiet space. Easy enough in a library. I grabbed an old wind-up clock from the archives and found a safety pin in the staff break room.

I set up in the study room farthest from the front desk. It had no windows, just a single fluorescent bulb that buzzed faintly overhead. I wound the clock and set it on the table, its ticking echoing in the silence.

The next step was... unsettling. “Prick the tip of your finger and let a single drop of blood fall onto the clock’s face.”

The pin was dull, I had to press way too hard to break the skin but eventually it happened. A bead of blood welled up, and I let it drip onto the glass face of the clock. The ticking seemed to get louder, more insistent, as if the clock was alive and... *hungry*.

The final step was to close my eyes and count backwards from ten, timing each number to a tick of the clock.

“Ten. Nine. Eight…”

The air in the room grew heavy, pressing down on my chest.

“Seven. Six. Five…”

The ticking slowed, each tock dragging out unnaturally. It felt like time itself was warping.

“Four. Three…”

The sound of the clock was no longer alone. Beneath it, I heard something else—faint at first, like static, but growing louder.

“Two. One.”

I opened my eyes, and the room wasn’t empty anymore.

The fluorescent light was still on, but it flickers erratically, casting jagged shadows on the walls. The clock was no longer ticking—it was *humming*. And then I heard it: a voice.

No, not *a* voice. *Voices.* Dozens of them, layered on top of each other, all speaking at once. Some were whispers, some were shouts, and some made no sense at all. It was like a radio dial spinning wildly, catching fragments of conversation from stations that shouldn’t exist.

“Help us.”  
“Stay away.”  
“Don’t look back.”  
“Closer, closer, closer…”

The voices surrounded me, crawling into my ears, my skull. I clapped my hands over my ears, but it didn’t help—they were inside my head.

Then, one voice cut through the chaos.

“You shouldn’t have listened.”

It was clear, calm, and terrifyingly close, as if someone was standing right behind me. I froze. The room felt colder, darker, the shadows on the walls shifting in ways they shouldn’t.

I don’t remember standing up, but suddenly I was running. I left the clock, the book, everything behind. I bolted out of the study room, down the stairs, and  into the bathroom.

I don’t know how long I hid in the bathroom, but it felt like a long time as I debated what I wanted to do . I wanted to leave, but this is my job and there was still at least a couple hours before I could close up. Eventually I came to the conclusion that I was just gonna have to suck it up and finish my shift so I slowly opened the door to the bathroom and made my way up the stairs.

As I made my way up the stairs, I thought I heard footsteps coming from the first floor near the main desk. At first I thought it was just me hallucinating, but eventually, I realized that they were real and that a patron must’ve come into the library. I quickly made my way up the stairs to the main desk to take care of this guy. He was probably waiting for a very long time.

As I approached I could see a man standing in front of the main desk. I couldn’t get a good look at his face, but he was wearing an old black hat and an old black coat in a style that I could only describe as 18th century undertaker. as I got closer eventually, he saw me, but rather than say something about having waited such a long time for service he just stared at me silently as I went behind the desk, giving me my first look at this man’s pale, almost decayed face, with deep, hollow eyes that were almost entirely empty, like an old skeleton.

Before I could even ask what he wanted he let out in a gravelly voice “do you have a book with a spiral on the cover” completely set back by the question he asked me I didn’t know how to respond, but then I noticed a weight in my right hand, so I look down to notice that the spiral book which I know for a fact I left upstairs in the study room had now teleported into my right hand.

“There it is” he said, pointing to the book in my hands “I’d like to check that out please” completely overtaken with fear and simply wanting to get rid of both the book and the stranger I handed him the book. The stranger looked at me then down at the book then back to me then back to the book and said “you shouldn’t have listened” and then slowly made his way out as I sat there in silence of what the stranger had just said.

I think I really did it this time guys. Whatever is out there is now aware of me and I really don’t know what to do other than to keep looking into those books to find out what exactly is going on with the hidden room.
