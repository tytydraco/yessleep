"Alice has never been the type who's passionate about hanging out in crowded places, has she?" Leyla sipped her iced coffee as she asked the question.

"Nope. Not in five years of friendship," I replied. I didn’t drink coffee—my stomach had an issue with it. So, I bit into my chocolate bar instead.

"What do you think changed, Elena?"

"Her apartment?" I laughed. "I mean, if you're asking what's recently changed in her life, she just moved. Not far from here."

"Maybe that’s why she asked to meet up here?"

"Still extremely unusual. I mean, it’s Alice we’re talking about. There are plenty of not-so-crowded places around here."

Leyla lifted her head, her expression shifting like she had just spotted something—or someone—she’d been waiting for.

"Speak of the devil. There she is."

"The devil?" I laughed again.

"No, Shithead! Alice!" Leyla had always been an unpleasant woman.

I turned around to see Alice just a few steps behind me, walking with her long black hair swaying elegantly.

"It’s unusual for you to ask to meet up in a crowded place like this," I said as she sat down in the last chair at our table.

"Really? Oh. I guess I didn’t think it through," Alice replied casually.

Her answer made me uneasy. Something felt off about her that night, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.

I watched as Alice and Leyla talked.

It was Alice. She looked like Alice. She wore Alice’s favorite outfit. But something about her didn’t feel right. Leyla didn’t seem to notice—or maybe she didn’t care.

"How about," Alice said to both of us, "I invite you guys to my new apartment? It’s close by."

We all agreed, and soon, the three of us were walking toward her new place.

We passed through the apartment gate, and I trailed behind Leyla and Alice, who were chatting as if they had the world to themselves. I paid close attention to Alice. The more I observed her, the more I felt like something was wrong.

"Alice," I called out her name.

"Yeah, El?" she responded.

"What are the last four digits of my phone number?"

Alice laughed. "How should I know? It’s your number, El. I have it saved, but I don’t remember it off the top of my head."

Weird. The last four digits of my number were her birth date and month—a long-standing inside joke between us. She used to remember it effortlessly.

"Here we are," Alice said proudly.

Alice showed us her living room. It was stylish and cozy, with a single bedroom.

"What does the bedroom look like?" Leyla asked, moving toward it.

"The electrical system is broken," Alice explained, opening the bedroom door and flipping the light switch. "I’ll get it fixed first thing tomorrow."

The light didn’t turn on—just as she said.

When they returned to the living room, my eyes caught something on the ceiling. It was dark inside, but with the help of the light from outside, I could see that the bulb in her bedroom wasn't installed.

So, it wasn’t the electrical system.

When I turned to close the door, I noticed something hanging at the bottom of the closet door. It looked like long, dark fabric.

My gut told me to check it out.

When Leyla and Alice weren’t paying attention, I slipped back into the bedroom. Kneeling down, I touched the fabric.

It wasn’t fabric.

It was hair. Long, black hair.

A chill ran down my spine.

Was it a wig? Or...was it someone?

Again, my gut urged me to open the closet door. Just a little—just enough to see inside.

The moment I realized what it was, I bolted upright, ran to Leyla, grabbed her hand, and dragged her out of the room.

"El? Hey! What the hell? Where are you taking me? What about Alice?" Leyla muttered, confused.

I didn’t answer.

"El?!"

"Quiet. I’ll tell you later."

Once we were outside the apartment building, I explained.

"So, what was it? A wig?" Leyla asked, baffled.

"No," I replied, trembling. "It was a person. A dead person."

"What?! Who?!"

"Alice."

"What the fuck, El? That’s absurd!" Leyla shouted hysterically. "Alice was just with me in the living room!"

"It was dark, but I was close enough to see it was Alice. Dead. In the closet. Which means there were two Alices. I don’t know which one’s real. But if the one in the closet is the real Alice, then we’re in grave danger."

"Then who was the Alice who met us at the café?" Leyla’s voice trembled.

"I don’t know!"

"What do we do now?"

"We tell the building guard and ask for help."

Reluctantly, Leyla agreed.

Drew, the building guard, accompanied us to Alice’s apartment. We knocked. No answer. Drew unlocked the door with his spare key, and we stepped inside.

We found Alice in the closet.

Dead.

Leyla and I screamed in horror. After discussing with Drew, we decided to call the police and wait outside the apartment.

While we waited, I noticed someone leaving the apartment across from Alice’s. A beautiful woman with long black hair.

The moment I saw her, I felt uneasy—the same uneasiness I’d felt when Alice approached us at the café earlier that night.

I brushed it off and returned to my conversation with Leyla and Drew. But then, I felt someone watching me. I turned my head to see the woman who had come out of the apartment across from Alice's. She stood there, a few meters away from me, staring at me with a strange and eerie expression.

And then, for a fleeting moment, her face shifted.

It became Alice’s face.

Seconds later, it shifted back.

My blood ran cold.
