I am scared. There is a light that is shining through my windows. It is too bright.

We were given warnings a few days ago that we’d be experiencing some sort of solar phenomena. Something to do with the Sun’s heat entering our atmosphere? I don’t know, I’m not an astrologist. I am a 34 year old guy, who’s typing on a subreddit, looking for answers. 

I can’t even imagine that weeks ago I was outside, mowing the lawn. My wife and kids were playing in the backyard. 

We can’t go outside anymore. My youngest son, Nelson, snuck out once while I had my back turned. I was cooking my lovely wife Jessie breakfast, too lost in the moment to hear the front door open and shut behind me. The screaming started shortly after. I rushed to the door and yanked it open to see my son covered in 2nd degree burns. His whole body glowing red. We were extremely lucky to have found him before he burned to pieces. No amount of aloe vera could’ve undone the damage Nelson suffered already. That was 2 weeks ago.

Ever since the incident, we laid a few ground rules. No going outside. No getting too close to windows. Always stay downstairs. I even started collecting water in small containers. Jessie closed blinds, and pulled mattresses down the stairs. We have our own little bunker.

I was scared at first, what would happen next. Every hour that went by seemed like a countdown to the end. Our TV stopped working days ago. The last thing that played was the same old news broadcast that has been airing for the past couple weeks. 

STAY INSIDE. WE ARE EXPERIENCING WORLD RECORD TEMPERATURES. HEAT WARNING. STAY INSIDE. 

Now I’ve accepted it. The world is going to end. All in hellfire. It is going to take away my family. My love. My life.

2 days it nearly took away Ben, my oldest. There was a noise outside, we assumed that a large building had collapsed. Jessie mentioned that it could be possible that the Sun was already beginning to melt the steel complexes around our neighborhood. I told her something along the lines of ”That definitely could be true, but it’s best not to find out”. This sparked Ben’s curiosity, as he immediately dropped his DS and ran over to us. He’s only 13. 

“Why can’t we look outside to see if stuff is melting Dad?” 

I warned him that we simply must keep away from the light. We have no idea what is behind those blinds. I gave him every possible, certifiable, reason to not look outside. Yet, later that day I dozed off with my wife on the couch. I opened my eyes only to see a figure amassed in light.

Ben had opened the blinds. 

“Dad! I can see-” 

It was agony. The sound of pure agony that drove me to my feet. I can feel the heat several feet away, and with each step it got more intense. I closed my eyes, trusting myself to find my way to the window. For what felt like ages, I fumbled until I could twist the blinds down. I heard them shut and I slowly opened my eyes. My hands were red. Actually, my whole body was red. Like I was sunburned. My son was slumped to the floor, cradled in a fetal position against the coffee table. 

“My eyes, dad! My eyes!” He kept repeating, his face buried in his hands.

I coaxed him until I could eventually pry his hands away. Ben’s face was caked in burns, half of it appeared to be melting off. His eyes. I couldn’t forget his eyes. They were entirely red. It looked like someone had taken a fire poker and jammed it into his sockets. Thankfully, Jessie was right behind me with a first aid kit and dampened rags. She patched him up, and wrapped bandages around his face. My eldest son is now mummified. 

I as well as Nelson have done my best to take care of Ben. He hasn’t eaten in the last 24 hours. We have to slip straws between his bandages and force him to drink water. Jessie went quiet after the incident. She stays around the couch, occasionally getting up to assist me with chores. The power went out not long ago. Maybe 26 hours have passed? I don’t know, but every day the light outside seems to get brighter. We are running out of water. I’m not sure how long we have left. The kids are being moved to the basement tonight. The living room is starting to grow warmer.

My phone is about dead, and I am losing signal. If you receive this, I’m not sure if I’ll still be alive by then. Once again. My name is Will Braham. It is the year 2087. I have a wife named Jessie, and two sons, Nelson and Ben. I don’t know how much time we have left. Please help us.
