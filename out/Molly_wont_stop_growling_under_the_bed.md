Okay so a little back story here. My husband and I have this really shitty bed frame. It’s basically two twin prison cots zip tied together. We have this stupid thing because we got bed bugs about a year ago, which is its own horror story, the moral of which is: PAY FOR AN EXTERMINATOR. Anyway, we had to throwaway our nice bed and because of the cost of everything we ended up with these hollow metal cot bases. 

We have two dogs, Hester, named after our High School’s football coach, and Molly, which was her name when we rescued her, it fit, so it stuck. Hester likes to sleep directly on top of you, where as Molly is most likely to be found under the bed or in another room if possible. She kinda has 13 year old girl energy. Sometimes she will lay in our bed before we get in bed but as soon as we even bump her she’s done and back under she’ll go. I think she likes her little cave. 

So last Wednesday was pretty normal, we all headed to bed and Molly hustled under the bed, despite me begging her to come cuddle me. After I gave up patting the bed and calling her name I fell asleep around 10:30 reading a spooky story on here.  Around 12am I woke up to Molly growling, which is unusual because she never growls and rarely barks. I asked her what was wrong and once she heard my voice she calmed down and I didn’t hear her growling any more. Me, being paranoid because of the story I’d just read, made my husband go check the house, to which he lightly protested because Hess hadn’t been barking or growling which he does to everything including our poor mail lady. He nonetheless relented and checked the other rooms.

“No murderers in the building! Molly was just dreaming. Go back to sleep.” 

I felt better but it was weird and I wanted to make sure Molly was okay, so I leaned upside down under the bed to check on Molly. I saw, what I thought was here fluffy tail wagging and said “are you okay Molly girl?” I just saw her wag her tail so I took that as a yes and popped back up and went to bed, but knowing what I know now, I don’t think it was Molly.  

The next day, Thursday, was uneventful, the most exciting thing I did was attend a vendor lunch at work but everything else at home was boring and normal. Dinner, TV, shower, bed. 

Same as the night before we all headed to bed only this time I fell right asleep because I was so tired from a bad nights sleep the night before. Then at 12 am it happened again, Molly growled only this time she barked too, which is actually what woke us all up. Even Hester started barking. 

I was so startled that I just yelled, “DOGS! CUT IT OUT!” Which stopped Molly but now Hester was all riled up and jumped down to check on his sister. I followed his lead and I peaked under the bed again, this time I saw what the night before I thought was Molly’s tail except Molly was on the other side of the bed, wagging her tail so I could tell it wasn’t her. I popped up and grabbed my phone for better light but when I looked back all I saw was a notebook, some dirty socks, every hair tie I’ve ever lost, and Molly just wagging her tail at me. 

When I told my husband he jokingly said it’s probably a ghost and told me to go back to bed. But I was still freaked, mostly from how jarring it is to wake up from a dead sleep to two barking dogs, so I stayed up and just tried to calm down. Molly decided that she would spend some time on top of the bed, which is kinda weird, but I knew as long as I didn’t invade her personal space, she would stay so I made some extra room. 

I was messing around on my phone when I heard the faintest rustling and what sounded like a door moving. I froze and I don’t think I’ve ever been so scared. I could see Molly, I was touching Hester, and my husband was out cold, so nothing else should have been making noise, certainly nothing should have been opening doors. It just sounded like the faintest noise of something scooting. I whispered “Molly?” Then it just stopped. I still couldn’t move so I held my breath and just listened, silence. Finally around 2:30 I was able to calm down enough to sleep and I fell into a restless sleep. 

The next day I didn’t have to work because I only work every other Friday, which was great because I was exhausted. It was a pretty lazy day. I decided I wanted a little nap so I let the dogs outside to play since it was so nice and walked to our bedroom for a little snooze. 

At 12 pm this time I heard Molly barking and growling under the bed again, which was impossible because I knew she was outside. And this time I felt it bump the bed. I immediately started crying because I was home alone and all I could imagine was a literal monster under my bed. As soon as it heard me sobbing it quieted down and the sounds stopped. I gathered enough courage to leap out of bed, as far from the bed as I could get, and sprinted outside. I called my husband at work and explained what happened. While he was compassionate he’s also about as pragmatic as one can be, so he told me I was probably just tired and heard the dogs from outside. I reluctantly agreed and decided to let the dogs in and nap on the couch. 

Friday nights for us is usually two bottles of wine and binge watching It’s Always Sunny until we are good and tipsy enough to playfully debate stupid things. Last Friday was no exception, I think we argued about whether or not black out curtains canceled noise or not. Which turned into why our dogs would be barking at nothing the last couple of nights. I told my husband that I kinda believed we had a ghost, and he teased I was being “dramatic.” Due to the wine over consumption I was feeling a little sensitive and I took it way more personally than I would have sober, so I pouted and said I didn’t want to sleep with him, which really only proves him right about the drama, but I stood my drunk, sensitive, ground and fell asleep on the couch. 

About twenty minutes later I’m woken up by barking and my husband yelling “MOLLY! STOP IT! What is going on!?” Only this time I wasn’t in there to prove it wasn’t Molly so I ran into our bedroom to check on everyone. Molly was still growling so I lifted the bed skirt to call Molly out, but the next thing I hear is Molly’s nails clicking on the hardwood behind me and that’s when I realized Molly had been under the coffee table when I bolted out of the living room. It hadn’t fully registered until I saw her behind me and not under the bed, but IT was under the bed. 

At first I thought it was a dog, because of all the hair I saw, however, when it turned toward me I saw it looked more human but it was growling EXACTLY like Molly. I gasped and scrambled back but it flinched and whimpered like I had hurt it. Then it slowly scooted away and disappeared. 

After that I told my husband to grab the dog’s leashes we were going to a hotel, or at the very least I was. Since he saw Molly follow me into the room after thinking he heard her under the bed, he agreed at the very least something was weird. I had to pay the Uber driver $20 to let us bring the dog’s despite noticing a substantial bit of cat hair. But I didn’t give a fuck I just wanted out. When we got to the hotel I told the front desk agent, half joking, that we were running away from home, which she didn’t find humorous and just dryly handed us the key.

We clambered up to our hotel room, luckily we had enough points to pay for the night and didn’t have to fight about how much the hotel was. And both of us drunk and exhausted passed out. We made it through the night without incident, except Molly was sleeping in the bed now, I guess she was rattled too.

The next morning after a nice hotel shower and bad hotel coffee I told my husband we needed to dismantle the bed and figure out what was going on. I said if I was going to sleep in that room again the bed frame either needed to be boarded up or we had to just put the damn bed directly on the floor.

I don’t think my husband was completely sold at this point but he did have to admit that Molly was acting weird at night, and last night did confuse him. So when we got home we started to pack our bed up. We settled on just laying it on the ground until we could afford a bed frame with drawers. (Poor Molly no more bed cave.)

As we went to pull the mattress off, the dogs started to lose it and scrambled to get under the bed now that there was more room. Once I could see what they saw I dropped my side of the mattress. Luckily my husband wasn’t looking under the bed and was able to catch it exclaiming “What the hell Ally you almost crushed the dogs!” 

With tears welling in my eyes I stared at the floor under our bed, there was a small roughly cut slab of our floor, presumably leading to the crawl space. Once I finally stammered out “I’m not crazy” my husband saw what I saw. 

“Hoe-lee shit! Molly, Hess get away from there NOW!” He said “Come on, everyone out of the house!”

My husband ushered us all out to the front porch and immediately called 911.

The cops came and spent a frustrating amount of time asking us if we were “sure this isn’t just your crawl space access”. To which we kept explaining over and over again that it wasn’t there when we moved in and pointing out it didn’t have a hinge. 

Saying that the crawl space was “most likely to have a possum or raccoon”, they called animal control and told us this wasn’t really a police matter.

I was so angry because I don’t know of any raccoons who can effectively cut a square door in my floor but I didn’t really have any other choice.

So, Jerry, our friendly neighborhood exterminator/relocater arrived with his cages and possum catching stick thing. We explained to him we felt VERY confident it wasn’t an animal, but since he was contacted by the police and they assured him we were being dramatic he decided to go in.

We waited and waited for him to come out. Praying he had a possum in his stupid fucking cage. But after about 20 minutes of complete silence we started to worry. We yelled down the hole, “Hey Jerry, everything okay down there?”

Silence. Shocking silence. Even the dogs seemed still, heads cocked, like they were listening for SOMETHING, anything. 

With no where else to turn we called the police again and explained what had happened. They just told us they would call his company and send someone else out…. But like, what? A man fully went missing in our crawl space?!?

So, here comes Jerry’s boss. We explain everything again and begged him not to go in the crawl space, to which he said “I’m not, that’s not really my job”. He walked around the house to look for other exits to the crawl space and when he found an opened hatch told us:

“Jerry, is our most tenured relocation expert, but he has a tendency to be a little anti social, he probably didn’t find anything, decided the job was done and left.”

That didn’t exactly feel like an answer to us, but this guy knows Jerry and we don’t so like, whatever, I guess. But also what am I going to do? Make him go look for Jerry?!? So he just left. 

It wasn’t until about an hour after he left that we realized Jerry’s van was still parked on our street. So I felt pretty confident that Jerry didn’t just leave the crawl space, unless he decided to hitchhike with his possum stick. 

But at this point it was like 9:30 pm and we were so tired and felt like we were out of options, and, unfortunately, hotel points. We decided to sleep in the guest room with the door locked and barricaded, per my “theatric, but frankly practical” recommendation. The floor in this room is built directly on the slab, since it’s a converted garage. 

We called for Jerry one more time but decided to put the mattress back on the floor, we figured if he was still under there he could get out of the hatch and I didn’t want a stranger crawling into my house in the middle of the night. We decided that either Jerry must be weirdo who actually just wandered off, or “the ghost ate him” (that’s only partially a joke at this point).

We made it through the next couple nights, no Jerry, but also no incidents. I guess his van just lives here now because I can’t get a hold of anybody at his company. I don’t really have any other option but to keep trying to call them and wait. It’s not like the police have helped at all. 

But now it’s Monday night at 12am, Molly is nuzzled under my neck, Hester is at my feet, and we cannot sleep because now we can hear them both growling under the bed.
