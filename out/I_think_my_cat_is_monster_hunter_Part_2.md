I had just knocked on the door of a perfect stranger because I think my cat wanted me to.

The girl on the other side of the door, still sobbing uncontrollably, was a college student, I knew that much. It was clear from the hurried expression on her face as we’d pass each other through the hall, her juggling a mountain of books, her laptop bag and a thermos of what smelled like coffee. I remember those days. I had dropped out in a fit of anger my junior year of college.

The stock market had just crashed in 2008 and suddenly the bill of goods I had been sold, the ticket to my American dream, was yanked out of my hands. What would have happened if I stayed the course?

Maybe I wouldn’t be taking orders from my cat, I thought glumly.

Gravy pawed at my leg and looked at the door. The woman was still crying.

I knocked again, louder this time.

“Excuse me, are you okay?” I asked again.

The door swung open, and there she stood, covered in dirt from her stomach down. She was a cute girl, blonde, shorter than me. Her hair was up in a ponytail, but that hadn’t stopped it from getting caked with dirt too.

The over-sized blue hoodie she wore had flecks of wetness on it - from her crying or something else, I couldn’t tell. She attempted a smile through the tears. She opened her mouth to speak, and before I knew it, Gravy had dashed inside her apartment.

“Damn it, Gravy,” I called after him. I hear a very curt meow back and he’s out of my sight.

A laugh cuts through her pain, and I see her smile for the first time since I moved here. She seems lighter at the moment. I glanced behind her to see the source of her frustration; two vases that once held large flowers had shattered on the floor, coating the hardwood with dirt and grime.

“It’s okay,” she says, extending her hand. She sniffles. “I’m Amber. You’re the new guy, right?”

I nod, and shake hers. Before I can say anything in return, Gravy darts into the room at full speed from behind her. He didn’t notice the loose rug he tried to stop on, however, and inertia sent him tumbling into a wall.

“Aw, poor thing!” Amber instantly goes to Gravy. She bent down, scooped him, and cradled him in her arms.

I watched, dumbfounded, as his personality shifts completely. Gone is the aloof, deep-meowed ball of fur and it had been replaced by what looked like an adorable, loving shelter cat. He nudges his face into her arms as she holds him, purring loudly. She motions to me to come in, and I carefully entered, stepping over the broken vases and flowers.

As I stepped past the threshold, I saw the broom and dustpan Amber was using to clean up this mess. Without hesitating, I grabbed it myself and began to sweep as she continued babying Gravy. She noticed me quickly, and stood up, Gravy still in her arms. He held eye contact with me, still almost unrecognizable in his cuteness, and meowed in three short bursts at me. His eyes darted to the hallway, which led to the rest of the apartment.

“You don’t have to do that,” Amber said. She still held Gravy. “I knocked them over.”

I scoffed at her.

“Nonsense. I’m a good neighbor. You sounded like you were having a day.”

She smiled warmly back at me, and I noticed her lips tremble a bit. This act of kindness had hit and made a clear impact. She pets Gravy, and sits down at her dining table as I continued to sweep.

“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you,” she said. Gravy continued to stare at me and meowed again, three short bursts.

I emptied the dirt and flowers into the trash can. She smiled up at me, and then suddenly became tense. I knew exactly what this was.

“I didn’t get your name,” she said, holding Gravy a bit tighter.

“I’m Shawn,” I said with a smile. “Nice to officially meet you. And that… cute, I guess, guy in your lap is Gravy.”

I hear Gravy exhale loudly and grunt, sounding annoyed. Amber giggled at the name and hugged him tighter. Then, on a dime, she became tense again and stared at me.

“I have a taser. And pepper spray. Nearby.”

Yep. I wasn’t wrong. This young woman had just let a man her age into her apartment without even really knowing me. The realization of that seemed to hit her, and while she never let go of Gravy, I definitely noticed her muscles tense and demeanor shift. I can tell at this moment; she’s wishing I was that fabled bear instead of a very real strange man. 

I raise my hands in front of my chest. I’ve had to do this song and dance before.

“That’s great hun,” I say, carefully choosing and putting some emphasis on hun. “But you aren’t necessarily my type.”

She studies me up and down, and looks at Gravy, and breathes a deep sigh of relief. She lets Gravy go onto the table, and he immediately plopped to his side, stretched, and showed her his belly. The smile on her grew as she excitedly rubbed his belly. He never let me do that.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude,” she explained. “I had a feeling you were gay. Ya’ know, single, the walk, well-dressed guy in his 30s with a cat…”

Um, ow, I think.

“Men have had me on edge lately,” she says softly. I noticed the bruises on her arm for the first time.

Gravy, without warning, darts back off towards the hallway. I hear the same short three meows, and a thump. With Gravy gone, the smile begins to fade again. She eyed the remnants of the plants in the garbage and began to cry again.

I immediately pull a chair up to her and put my hand on her shoulder. I know a relationship Bat-signal when I see one. Thankfully, I never discounted the power I had as a gay man when it came to comforting or being there for heterosexual women in pain.

I get it, sisters.

“Talk to me,” I said to her. “Looks like you need a friend. Or at least, some objective pseudo-stranger, yeah?”

She laughed. We both eased up, and then jumped, startled at Gravy once again flying into the room at full speed. He leapt onto the table, directly in front of me, eyes wide. The adorable furball in Amber’s lap was gone. Back in its place was the same scraggly ball energy that had woken me up that morning by slapping me in the face with his paw.

He meowed loudly, directly in my face, slapped me three times in succession, and darted back off the table and into the hallway. I saw Amber eye me inquistively.

“He’s just got the zoomies,” I replied. "He's aggressive."

“You shouldn’t let him hit you like that,” she replied instantly. The response surprised herself.

And there it is. I heard the faint sound of Gravy in the hallway.

“I, uh, just got out of a bad situation,” she said, not making eye contact with me. She rubs the back of her head and is suddenly aware again of the bruises showing.

I let the implications hit me, but I knew enough to not address this directly. These things, especially when they’re fresh, need a delicate touch. I waited for her to continue, and she began to tear up.

“My ex left a week ago,” she said, still not making eye contact with me. She sniffled and laughed, the sudden change in demeanor confused me.

“You won’t believe me,” she said.

I heard more scratching. A low, pronounced meow. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. 

“You’d be surprised at what I believe.”

She leaned back in her chair, sighed, and for the first time since opening up, made eye contact with me.

“I think my ex cursed me.”

My heart sank, and the sudden reality of the situation hit me like a ton of bricks. I no longer was comforting a poor girl that needed a friend at the moment - I was here for something else, something that my damn cat of all things (where was he?) had put me up to something that could very well put my life in danger again.

I began to sweat. She leaned forward and began to speak.

“It’s ridiculous. I feel so dumb,” she said, in a self-deprecating chuckle. “But have you ever heard of this idiot wannabe ghost hunter, Chris Spectre?”

My heart began to pound. Panic began to fill my lungs as I felt in the undertow of a world that was not going to let me go. I saw her eye me, and regained my composure. I shake my head, no. I hadn’t.

“That’s the problem,” she laughed dryly “Do you know how much ghost hunting pays?”

God, I hope I never find out. I shake my head again, no.

“Nothing. Not when you’re some loser that’s not even on youtube yet,” she scoffs. “Some dumb underground startup video site for other paranormal losers.”

I hear more scratching from the hallway. I eye Amber, and realize she hasn’t clocked it.

“He comes home one night, stinking of that cheap scotch he drank,” she said, starting to get into the story. “Swore he had the thing, the big thing that’d make us rich finally. Got his big break, he said! Something about how proud he was… pissed me off. I had heard this before. I had it.”

“I can’t blame you,” I said. My eyes drifted to the bruises again.

“Not good to hide it, I guess,” she said and unfurled her sweatshirt. I winced at the patchwork of bruises all along her arms. “The fresh ones are at the top, when I told him to leave. The others? Yeah.

“He, uh, got violent. The apartment is in my name, thankfully - and he didn’t like being reminded of that. He stormed through the apartment, locking himself in the rooms, and I let him have it, I mean, REALLY have it. I told him next time he laid hands on me, I was going to call to the police.

“And that’s when he left. He passed me in the hallway, mumbled something at me in a language I didn’t recognize, and told me that something else will be taking care of this.”

“And ever since?” I asked.

The tears begin. Gravy darts into my peripheral from the hallway, raising his paws in the air frantically. I raise a finger to him, and stop - that was ridiculous.

“Things have been breaking. I hear things crawling around at night. I feel something wet and slimy in bed with me. I didn’t knock over the pots just now..."

She leaned in closer and began to whisper.

"Something else did."

Gravy had snuck toward me during all of this and began tugging on my pants.

“Um, Amber,” I say slowly. “Bathroom? I’m so sorry.”

She points down the hall and smiles warmly.

“To your left.”

I get up, and Gravy leads the way. I feel an immediate sense of stupidity at my actions and acknowledge that I am in fact following my cat. Gravy reaches the bathroom and scurries inside, hopping up on the toilet seat. I slowly enter and feel an immediate sense of something being desperately wrong. I close the door behind me and eye Gravy.

He sniffs the air and hops up from the toilet to the sink and began pawing at the medicine cabinet. I step in front of the toilet and unzip, eyeing him the entire time. He paws at harder and stares at me.

“It’s not polite to look in someone’s medicine cabinet,” I said to him.

Gravy meowed back and hissed. Fine. I reached over with my free hand to open the cabinet as I began to pee. It slowly swung open, revealing…

Nothing. It was the same medicine cabinet as any young twenty-something girl. I scoffed at Gravy and rolled my eyes.

“Happy?”

Gravy stared questioningly at the cabinet - not the cabinet, I realized, but the photograph taped to the back of the cabinet door.  It was Amber and a tall, square-shouldered brickhouse of a man with a receding hairline, stubble that seemed to desperately want to be a beard and a tight black tee on. His black tee-shirt only had the words “The Spectre” on it - it was clear who I was looking at. What wasn’t clear was why Amber still had this.

Without any sort of warning, a torrent of water came from the toilet, covering me in a mixture of stale toilet water, my own piss, and much to my disgust, some other unspecified sewage. It hit me with such force that it knocked me back against the wall. I was dizzy, vision blurred, and the smell nearly took me out. I heard Gravy shake and growl next to me, loudly, and clearly agitated that he also got soaked

The toilet gurgled precisely three times.

I wiped the slime and pee from my face, gagging. I heard the sounds of claws on porcelain and looked to the toilet just in time to see three - well, I wasn’t sure what I was seeing. My brain was already having trouble processing the sewage explosion, and now I’m being handed what only could be described as reptilian rats.

They had the claws, gnarled and yellow, as well as jagged incisors that jutted out over their bottom lips. The bodies, however, were a mix of fur and scales in random tufts. The tails were longer than any rat I’ve ever seen, and they chittered and squeaked to each other in an oddly excited, almost mischievous fashion.

The doorknob began to turn, I never locked it, I realized and one of the sewer monsters sprung at it immediately.

“Are you okay? What was that?” Amber asked from the other side, concerned.

I locked the door and felt the creature bite into my arm.

“Yeah, just, uh, bad food,” I got out as the thing thrashes wildly on my arm, slashes it in ribbons.

On the floor, Gravy was already in the middle of it, having one of the creatures in a tight hold, slashing it with bunny kicks. I scanned the small bathroom for the other creature, and if on cue, I felt claws on my back and a tail wrap itself around my neck and yank me off the door.

I fell directly into the bathtub, taking the shower rod and curtain down with me. I reached out, flailing, trying to get ahold of something. The fall had created some space between me and my attackers, but I felt the tips of their claws still slashing at me from the curtains.

I finally grabbed something solid and pulled - it was the shower knob. Scalding hot water began to pour out of the shower head, and I screamed out in pain. I heard Amber yell from outside the door and it sounded like she tried to knock it down.

“Don’t come in here!” I yelled. “Almost finished!”

I managed to pull myself out of the confines of the shower curtain and out of the bathtub. The steam from the shower continued to cloud my vision, and I couldn’t make Gravy out on the floor - all I heard was growls and wet gurgles. I began to panic. I heard the two creatures in the bathtub chitter and scream out to each other, and before I knew it, the shower rod the curtain was attached to was in my hand and coming down hard on them.

I heard the rod connect with thunks and cracks, but they were still thrashing about. I needed something stronger. I turned back to the sink quickly and opened the drawers underneath. I heard more growls behind me. I stuck my hand in the drawer, still unable to really see what I was flailing for, until I came across the unmistakable feel of a two-progged rectangle Amber kept in her sink cabinet for safety.

I grabbed the taser, and immediately realized I had no idea what the fuck I was doing. I knew there was a button on these things, a switch maybe - my thumb came across one thankfully. I reached out into the steamy fog and found the shower knob quickly. I turned it off, pressed the switch, and winced at the cackle of electricity. I nearly dropped it.

I steadied my nerves quickly, though, and just as one of the creatures had gnawed its way out of the shower curtains, I slammed the taser directly in its face. The effect was immediate, and disgusting.

With rapid speed, the creature began to convulse, its scales popping off its body next to its melting fur. Its eyes began to melt out of its socket, and that alone was nearly enough to make me want to turn away, but I had to stay strong. With a sickening wet pop, the creature’s stomach exploded its guts onto me and the rest of it went limp.

The other creature broke itself free and lashed at me with its tail, knocking the taser out of my hand. As soon as it thought it had disarmed me, it lunged, jaws open, at my throat. I scrambled for the taser but couldn’t reach.

Out of nowhere, almost like a god-damn wrestler, I see Gravy’s paws whip out from the remaining bit of steam and grab the creature mid-air. I hear a loud thunk to the ground and the tearing of flesh. I lunged back at the taser, grabbed it, and turned it back on. I turned around, fully expecting to get the jump on this last one, and freeze.

The creature had its tail wrapped around Gravy’s neck and was squeezing. Behind them, the corpse of the one Gravy had taken out began to melt. Gravy pawed frantically at the tail, unable to break free. The creature chittered at me, staring me down, and it almost sounded like laughter. I saw it squeeze again. Gravy’s eyes bulged and I heard him cough.

Please, don’t let this be his last life, I thought.

I flicked the taser on and shoved it into the creature’s stomach, electrocuting both the creature and Gravy at the same time. The thing’s eyes went wide, clearly not expecting this. The reaction this time was immediate - the stomach exploded out front and the eyes as well. The force of the blast sent Gravy into the wall.

I frantically wiped the gore off my face and went to Gravy, who was lying on the ground. I picked him up and held him close - still breathing, thank God. I felt him stir awake in my arms, and before I knew it, he lashed out with three blunt paw smacks, rapid succession on my face.

He fell out of my arms and I heard him meow to himself crankily. I leaned back against the door and closed my eyes, trying to process this but my brain getting way too hung up on the cognitive dissonance and ontological shock of what I just experienced.

I heard more cranky meowing and felt Gravy pawing at my leg. I opened my eyes, and noticed that the picture of Amber and Chris had fallen to the ground during the chaos. It had landed face-down, and while it was caked with a mixture of sewage and blood, it was impossible to not see the strange set of markings that was on the back of the picture. I reached down to pick it up and felt my fingers begin to tingle. Odd.

I wiped more of the grossness off the picture, and studied what could only be described as glyphs. Something felt perverse about them - like it was a violation of privacy, that those symbols shouldn’t be there, that they shouldn’t be anywhere, really. They felt powerful.

Huh, I thought to myself. That’s a weird word to associate with this.

My fingers began to burn more intensely. The glyphs began to glow. Some deep, hidden sense of instinct kicked in. The toilet bubbled once and I didn’t hesitate.

I tore that picture to shreds.

The toilet calmed. The steam faded completely. I got a good look at my surroundings, closed my eyes, and really took in the scent of the blood and sewage. I might as well, I thought. There’s no amount of cheap mall cologne that could cover this.

I turned around and opened the door to a stunned Amber. She looked behind me at the mess and her jaw dropped. She went to speak, but I cut her off.

“Why’d you keep that picture?” I asked.

She wasn’t expecting that. She stuttered, surprised.

“He hit you, Amber,” I said, frustrated. The time for kid gloves was over.

“Yeah, I know,” she said, the tears beginning to come. “But I think, maybe I made a mistake sometimes. Maybe a few bruises is worth not living in this world alone. Maybe we could’ve gotten back to that picture.”

“Well, you can’t, I ripped it up because I’m pretty sure it was cursed,” I shot back instantly.

I push beside her and make my way towards the kitchen. I’m done. I’m tired. I’m literally covered in shit and monster guts and I know deep down I need to answer the call and comfort her but holy shit do I need a minute first. And I think I made my point pretty clear.

“Let’s go, Gravy.”

A short meow in reply and he’s at my side.

“But what about my bathroom?” she asks from behind me.

“I took care of your curse problem,” I said, not turning around. “You can clean up the rest.”

I knew there’s a deeper conversation there but all I could think about was getting back to my apartment and having the best shower of my life. I looked down at Gravy and he made eye-contact with me, and I swear to you this cat looked so self-satisfied I wanted to scream.

I reached for the apartment door and it swung open before I could grab the handle. Standing directly in front of me was Chris Spectre himself, in that same stupid shirt with his name on it,  whose face ran from surprise to anger at seeing another man in Amber’s apartment. I had to look up at Chris, who was a little bit more intimidating than I had believed he was. However, I was still running on the fumes of adrenaline and now rage at the sight of a woman beater standing in front of me.

“What the fuck are you?” He spits out at me. Not who, but what.

My eyes immediately fell to his neck tattoo - the same glyphs that were on the back of the picture. I lower my eyes to Gravy, who eyes me too - he’s clocked this as well.

I squint at him.

“Your beard is even worse in person,” I said to him. “No wonder you’re not even on Youtube.”

I felt two things in very rapid succession, and I’m not sure what happened first. One thing was Chris’s fist connecting squarely with my face and sending me to the ground. The other thing was feeling Gravy scurry up my back, likely as Chris pulled back his arm, and leap off my shoulder at his face.

Not knocked out but feeling like shit, I stumbled to my feet - surprised at Amber helping me up. I heard thumping from the hallway and stuck my head outside to see Gravy tearing into Chris’s face. I saw Gravy, very calculated, take a sweep at the glyph tattoo on his neck, causing a small gash across the lines

“Get your fucking cat off me!”

I stepped out into the hallway.

“He’s really got a mind of his own.”

I hear Gravy growl and hiss and I swear it almost sounds like he’s enjoying this.

“PLEASE!” Chris yells.

“Are you going to leave Amber alone?”

“YES!”

I whistled out, and Gravy disengaged. I smiled to myself - there’s absolutely no way Gravy was listening to me, but instead playing along. Chris held his hands to his neck, applying pressure to the wounds, catching his breath. I stood in front of him, and I had to be a sight - covered in the most disgusting foul shit imaginable with my magical fucking cat that nearly tore his jugular out.

“Get the FUCK out.”

Chris scrambled to his feet, ran down the hallway, and disappeared down the stairwell.

Amber stood at the doorway of her apartment, speechless. I took a deep breath and sighed, exhaustion hitting me like a brick. I eyed the blood and cuts on my arm and thought about the first aid kit I had made sure to stockpile after the Jack-Thing attacked me.

I turned around and walked back to my apartment, not stopping back at Amber’s.

“So yeah I’ll call you in the morning,” I said to her flatly.

I opened my apartment door and Gravy scurried inside, no doubt to relieve himself after this chaos. I glanced back at Amber, who simply mouthed “thank you”, and all I could do was smile and nod.

I eyed Gravy as he turned the corner of my apartment and stepped out of sight. I felt waves of fear and trepidation. This cat has saved my life multiple times now, but at what cost? I don’t want to be in a life like this, where I’m looking over my back for monsters and things that go bump in the night. I don’t want the veil to lift and to see all the evil that lurks out there.

Worse yet, I don’t want to be the one to fight it.

I think about all of that, and then how insistent Gravy was that we go to Amber’s tonight. How he sniffed out the danger. How we both helped her. Don’t get me wrong - I’m happy to put the fear of Gravy into a woman beater, but I didn’t choose this life. My fucking CAT is pulling me into this.

And I don’t think I have a choice.

I smiled back at her, nodded once, stepped inside and closed the door.
