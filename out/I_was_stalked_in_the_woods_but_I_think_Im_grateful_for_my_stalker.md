I used to love hiking and camping by myself. I had a few odd moments as a single woman traveling alone, but most of my experiences were positive overall. 

I grew up in the Deep South so sometimes I get this overwhelming need to get out of the city and spend time alone. On this particular occasion, I roadtriped for two days and went to a very remote location. I got into my head that I going to complete an obscure 15 mile hike in the middle of nowhere. The trailhead was a little off the beaten path and hard to get to by car so I decided to park, hike four miles and camp, and then set off early the next day to complete the route. 

When I stopped at the nearest town, a man asked what my plans were. I didn’t think much of it, but I gave him my general spiel. 

He tensed up a little and asked if it was a good idea to spend time alone like that in such an isolated location. I laughed because I had been on way sketchier adventures and assured him I was fine. 

*To this day, something about this interaction seems off to me. He was very old though, so there was no way he followed me.*

The hike to the general area where the trailhead began was absolutely gorgeous. I was feeling the high that comes with isolation and stopped paying much attention to the area around me. It didn’t strike me to check the location. 

I set up camp pretty early, which gave me time to explore. I was giddy as I waded through a small creek like a child. I heard a tree branch snap, but I didn’t think much of it until I saw a tiny bit of movement out of the corner of my eye. I paused, expecting to see some animal, but when I scanned the tree line everything was still. 

Then, I saw a tiny, tiny piece of fabric float in the wind and *barely* made out the shape of a human. I froze and watched closely, letting my eyes adjust to the figure in the  distance. I had just about convinced myself I had gone crazy. I took a step forward, ready to find a reasonable explanation, when all of a sudden a man darted to the north. He ran a few strides and then disappeared into the woods. 

I felt sick. I had literally thought about getting naked just moments before because I was convinced I was totally alone. 

At that point I had a choice to make. It was getting dark. By the time I packed up camp, it would arguably be dangerous to hike back to the car. The trail wasn’t bad and I’m an experienced hiker but I was unfamiliar with the terrain. 

On the other hand, someone had been watching me and I hadn’t told anyone back home where I was staying. I generally trust that folks aren’t dangerous, and assumed he was a curious local who didn’t have bad intentions. 

*It had definitely been a man. I know that for certain and it will become important later in this story. He was at least six foot and I could tell by the way he ran.* 

After some deliberation, I made the decision to stay. I was exhausted and kept telling myself the fear was in my head. I did pull out my pepper spray though. 

I stayed up for a while reading with a lantern, but I finally turned my lights out and got settled in. 

When I was drifting off, something woke me up though. I’m not really sure what it was, but I somehow got this overwhelming feeling that I wasn’t alone. Something also told me not to turn my lantern on. My logic was that, if I was being stalked, it’d be better not to scare them off. 

I very, very slowly got my shoes on and crawled out of my tent. I started studying the tree line with slow and careful precision, but it was too dark to make anything out. I *felt* something though. I couldn’t explain it but I knew I wasn’t alone. 

“You have to leave,” a voice whispered from behind me. I spun around quickly and felt a scream get stuck in my throat. A woman was crouched at the edge of the clearing, watching me. I knew it was a woman because she had on some kind of nightgown, which means the man I saw earlier was somewhere unseen, possibly watching this interaction. 

“You have to leave,” she said louder. 

This time I screamed. I screamed and stumbled back. Somehow I had enough sense to grab my smaller pack before I took off toward my car which was miles away. I had a hat with a tiny light on it, but otherwise I was stumbling in the dark, praying I was on the right path. I was also convinced that at any moment I was going to get snatched. 

Thank god I had my keys in my bag. I somehow made it to my car (I’m fairly certain that was my P.R.), and I’ve never felt so much relief to get inside my beat up little clunker. 

I locked the doors and let out a breath of relief when my car turned on. I half expected it to be dead. 

I drove for an hour until my cell service was solid enough to find a hostel-style compound nearby. It was the first time in my life I was grateful to be in a shared dorm, because I did not want to be alone. 

It was late when I got in, so I didn’t talk to anyone until the next morning when I finally made friends with a few other hikers and spilled my story. They listened in horror as I cried out of fear. 

Everyone was absolutely stunned except the owner of the motel-hostel-compound thing who just kind of shrugged. 

“There’s only one family in that area. I think I know who that woman would be and I promise she’s very harmless,” the owner noted. 

“Then why?” I asked. “Why did she sneak into my campsite. She had to have been stalking me. I didn’t have a fire going or anything.” 

He considered this. “I don’t know, but I suspect she had a reason.” 

Armed with a new cohort of hiker friends, we went back to my campsite later that morning. I had left thousands of dollars worth of food and gear. 

This next part is the creepiest. 

My tent was still up, but all of my stuff had been gone through. However, it wasn’t ransacked. In fact, everything looked neat and laid out perfectly, like someone knew I’d come back. Nothing was missing. 

I packed everything up as my new hiker friends and I proposed different theories to explain what had happened. 

Before I left I glanced around the tree line to see if I was still being watched. I didn’t see anything, but just in case someone was watching I mouthed “thank you” and tipped my hat. 

I’ve turned this over a million times in my head and have considered every option. At best, I think someone was trying to catch a glimpse of me changing or something. I don’t want to think of the worst case scenario. 

Still, I can’t shake the feeling that the woman I saw wasn’t there to hurt or scare me. I have an overwhelming feeling she knew something I didn’t and knew I had to get out.
