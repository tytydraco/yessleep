Three nights. Three nights of broken sleep, my mind racing every time my head hit the pillow. Even going to bed early hadn't helped. But last night, I was determined. Book in hand, early bedtime, quality time with my wife Maya. We talked, laughed, read together.

And then it happened. I finally fell asleep.

I was deep in some corporate nightmare - my colleagues and I discovering our company had murdered someone's grandmother on a flight to London (typical weird illogical dream). When a violent sound woke me up.

SLAM!

Our balcony door had been thrown open with such force it jolted both Maya and me awake. The night poured in: boulevard traffic noice, crickets chirping their midnight chorus.

"Maya," I said, still lying in bed, "did you hear that?"

"What?" But I could hear the uncertainty in her voice.

"I think a window opened. Can you check if we have one open in here?"

She got up and checked our bedroom windows one by one. Then, heading to the third window, her voice changed to that tone that makes your blood run cold. Suspicion mixed with rising panic.

"Mark, the lights in the entry are on. Please stand up."

The way she said it got me out of bed immediately.

We have photocell lights in our hallway so our son Jake can navigate to the bathroom at night without waking us up. Those lights were glowing softly in the darkness.

I approached the entry, my heart starting to race, but I tried to look confident. I knew Maya was watching, and I didn't want to freak her out even more. *Maybe* Jake *just went to the bathroom,* I thought.

I peeked gently around the corner. My office door was open with lights on inside. I sometimes forget to close it, and maybe I'd forgotten to turn off my desk lights too. Still no panic.

Then, as I took my first step into the entry, Maya's voice cut through the silence: "The balcony lights are on too."

That's when my heart started pounding against my ribs. The balcony has motion sensors too. What if we actually had an intruder who'd made his way in from the balcony? The sound I'd heard was a balcony door opening.

This is one of men's biggest fears.

I started shaking but tried not to show it. First, Jake's room - I had to know he was safe. I crept in, and there he was, sleeping peacefully under his covers. I turned off his lights and headed toward the living room.

This time, I didn't peek confidently. I moved like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible, pressed against the wall.

From what I could see, one of our two balcony doors was wide open.

My adrenaline spiked, but something drove me forward. I wanted this to end quickly. If nobody was there, I'd be completely awake and facing another sleepless night. So I'd risk it.

Moving slowly into the living room, I caught the smell of tobacco. The roar of motorcycles from the boulevard added to the atmosphere. *That's it,* I thought. *Nobody in my family smokes, and it smells like someone who does.*

I was ready for battle, even as I shook. I got into BJJ position, thinking, *I'm already in, so no stepping back now.* Even though I knew if someone was here he would have at least a knife, and my white belt skills probably wouldn't help. I'd probably be dead. But something kept me pushing forward.

Left side - clear. Right side - clear. Front sofa nobody. Back sofa - nobody. Kitchen area - empty. The motorcycle sounds continued outside.

I approached the open door and slammed it shut, then checked the balcony itself. Nobody there.

"Is everything okay, Mark?" Maya called from the bedroom.

"Yes! Nobody's here!"

We met back in the entry, but Maya wasn't satisfied. "I'm sure those entry lights were on, and Jake wasn't the one who triggered them - he was completely covered when you checked him."

"Okay," I said, "let's check every place Jake hides when we play hide-and-seek. Maybe someone who got in just hid somewhere."

Together, we searched every possible hiding spot, including the balcony. Everything was clear.

Then we solved the mystery. The night before, we'd had dinner on the balcony. Whoever came in last had just closed the door without turning the handle to properly lock it. The wind had blown it open. The tobacco smell was most likely our neighbour. Even at 2 or 3 AM on other sleepless nights, I'd heard him lighting up cigarettes. A leaf or something had probably triggered the balcony motion sensors.

Everything had a logical explanation.

Except those entry lights. I didn't dare challenge Maya's observation that Jake hadn't been the one to trigger them. That remained our only mystery.

We talked for a while after that, processing what had happened.

We discussed the situation again and concluded that if someone had actually been there, he would've cut me down, and Maya would've had no chance after that. So we agreed maybe next time she should be the bait, and maybe I'd have a chance to surprise the intruder with a BJJ submisison.

Sometimes the thing you fear most is exactly what you need to overcome what's really keeping you awake.
