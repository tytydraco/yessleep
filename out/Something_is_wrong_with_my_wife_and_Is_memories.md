I live up near the Berkshires in Massachusetts with my wife, whom I've been married to for 4 years. We met in college, freshman year, and have been through all the highs and lows, as expected in growing relationships. During the first year of our relationship, we were practically aimless and constantly bickered, making up things to be upset about. The main reason for this is because this was the first time either of us had been in a serious relationship. At first, we struggled to find common ground during arguments but we've learned how to communicate since then. We've been very patient with each other in every possible scenario we come across and I have always tried to be there for her during our rough patches. Which is why I've come on  here to share the events of the past few nights or so.

For context, my wife loves to mess with me and tease me, which is usually lighthearted and funny for the both of us. However, recently something's been happening that goes beyond her usual antics.

Last night, Jaslyn, my wife, sat up facing the bedroom window in our two story house at around 3:30 in the morning. I'm a very deep sleeper but tend to wake up halfway whenever my wife gets in or out of bed. This also means that until Jaslyn returns back to bed and to her very tired husband, I can't fall back asleep (she does not know this).

Sometimes, Jaslyn will get up to use the bathroom after a dinner that most definitely did not sit well with her, during these kinds of events I  just lay there waiting for her to finish up, burning the midnight oil. When Jaslyn arose, she sat up, stiff as a board, and walked out into the hallway.

Now, while it is true that I wake up quickly when she's shifting, I'm not always fully cognizant. Once my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I felt myself halfway coming to. Through blurred eyes, my alarm (which had previously read 3:30) now read 4:15. As I mentioned before, this would be normal if she was in the bathroom and I would've paid no mind.

I knew something was off because the lights weren't on; Jaslyn has always been terrified of the dark. She always turns the lights on when she's up. After this, I decided to finally get up and search for my wife, thinking she was probably getting a snack and watching TV downstairs. However, when I walked into our upstairs hallway, I didn't hear the low whirr of the TV or see a single light on. Not wanting to spook Jaslyn by turning on all the lights in the house, I crept down the stairwell to face our living room to see if she had simply just sleepwalked and passed out on the couch, not there either.

I searched the entire house but couldn't find any sign of her. Our car was still in the driveway and her black North Face jacket was still hanging up on the coat rack. Her phone went straight to voicemail no matter how many times I called. This went on for over an hour.

At around 5:15 (not knowing what to do) I walked upstairs, frantically texting Jaslyn and asking, "Where r u??" and "Idk if ur messing with me but im very tired and have a 9 AM class", as I'm a professor at a college. As I put down my phone and slid into the bedroom, the lights were off. My eyes once again adjusting to the dark, I noticed a figure in my bed, underneath the bedding. At first I thought it was just some pillows myself or my wife put aside, but that thought was quickly dismissed after the sheets had moved.

I didn't know what to do. Absurdly, I remember thinking that it might be someone who had mistaken our house for theirs. Maybe they were drunk. Now, I understand why my reaction to this figure was abnormal but you have to understand, I searched the entire house for my missing wife. Every light was on, every closet and nook was searched, and I even cleared that God-awful basement that I dread going down to do laundry every week.

I walked up to the moving figure in my bed, halfway thinking I was in a lucid dream or something and promptly turned on the bedside lamp. I yanked the bedsheets back with unnecessary force, jumping back like a frightened cat.

It was my wife. The same wife that had just been missing for over an hour. She blurted out justifiable complaints on why I'd woken her up at this hour. I just stood there staring at her, mouth agape and overwhelmed with a feeling akin to stupidity. Relief washed over me, followed by immense annoyance with Jaslyn because I thought she was playing another stupid game with me just to get a laugh.

"Jaslyn, I have work in the morning and you waking me up to a house search is not something I like doing to start my day," I complained with a huff.

Half-asleep, she groaned, "What are you talking about?”

"I’ll give it to you though, you threw me for a loop. Where were you hiding anyway?" I asked, half-chuckling.

"It's 3 in the morning, Reid. Get back in bed, I'm not in the mood right now." She said looking over at the digital alarm clock on her bedside table.

We both glanced at the alarm clock, my face draining color. I thought maybe she'd changed the clock as a part of her assumed "joke”. I whipped out my phone to double check. What had read 5:15 AM just two minutes before I entered the bedroom now read 3:32. I don't get scared easily, but in my nearly-thirty years of living, turning around and checking the hallway lights all being off and my text messages I sent to my wife disappearing sent a chill down my neck. As perplexed as I was, I simply got into bed, switched off the lamp, and laid down.

I kissed my wife on the cheek and apologized for disturbing her. She replied with a *‘mmfmmmh...'* and a small smile. I didn't sleep that night, not necessarily because I was scared, but more disturbed by what had just happened. I questioned if I had taken too much of my medication or if there was some sort of carbon monoxide floating around. The possibility of CO poisoning is highly unlikely because our house is almost fully electric and we just had our home's annual inspection a week prior.

After hours of trying to come up with an explanation, my wife finally got up to start getting ready for her morning shift. She's an ICU nurse. Jaslyn asked if I had a rough night, not remembering my disturbance. I replied that I was going to be taking a sick day, blaming my stomach.

The moment she closed the front door, at 7 AM, I immediately headed towards my office, scrambling up a small set of stairs to a private study. After emailing my students that I would be cancelling class (which I’m sure was followed with celebration) I looked up symptoms of sleep paralysis, which wouldn’t make sense since I was walking around and talking. Sleep deprivation, sleepwalking, night terrors, medication-related hallucinations, etc.

I surfed online for possibilities until about 9 AM. Nothing seemed to match the night prior other than maybe Hypnopompic Hallucinations where a person’s brain can leave REM sleep, but parts of the dreaming system stay “on” while their eyes are open and their body is moving. I’d have believed this to be my ailment had it not been for my phone disappearing from next to me. I swore I had put it right next to my mouse pad.

I got up and searched my office to no avail. I went on to search the bedroom, under the sheets, the hallway, absolutely nothing. I groaned while inside the hallway thinking it was just another phone misplacement that I’m sure that I, and many others have experienced.

Until, while groaning, I craned my neck to the top of the bookcase in our hallway to the sight of my phone, standing perfectly vertical. To give you a better understanding, our bookcase, which was gifted to us by Jaslyn’s parents as a wedding gift, is about 9 feet tall. I stand at 5’7 and my wife 5’1½. There is no way either of us could have gotten it up there unless either of us used a step-ladder or if we climbed the very thin fragile shelves of this mahogany goliath. And besides, Jaslyn had gone to work far after this could’ve happened.

I eventually got the phone down by embarrassingly using my golf club that I have never used. A gift from my father-in-law. Instead of being perplexed like last night, I was downright terrified of my home because this time, I was completely alone.

This can’t be a symptom of Hypnopompic Hallucinations because I had been awake all night, into the morning and to this very moment.  Like I said, we live in the Berkshire region, where our neighbors are separated by a thick layer of dense forest and the nearest street light is 15 miles away.

Needless to say, we’re tucked away in New England. When you’re experiencing something like this in say a city or a densely populated town, you could maybe chalk it up to someone getting inside your house and fucking with you then calling the police to inform them there’s an intruder in your home. That’s not the case here. I’m great friends with all my neighbors and I know for a fact none of them would do something as deranged as this. I don’t even think they could do something like this at all, such as sneaking into my office and grabbing my phone without alerting me. Nothing else happened for the rest of the day, but while I was searching online I had music playing along with the TV on to help myself from freaking out.

After Jaslyn got home, the house blaring with noise and seeing me crashed out  on the couch finally asleep, she barged inside with a kind of anger to the likes I’ve never seen from her before, waking me up. She said,

“What the hell were you thinking?”

Then slamming the door. I looked at her with confusion as Jaslyn went on to berate me and break down crying. She told me that I had called her at work, telling her that us getting married was my biggest mistake, that she was a waste of money, along with other words I can't even think to relay onto here. Oh, and she said I called her fat.

“What? Jaslyn, I was asleep. I didn’t call you. I would never—”

“Don’t give me that BS. You texted me some huge paragraph explaining how you never loved me and that our relationship was a sham from the start!” Jaslyn replied, cutting me off. I let what she said to me sink in for about sixty seconds before checking my phone and seeing no such texts.

“Jaslyn, I didn’t text you. Look,” I said, showing her my phone.

“You deleted those from your end, didn’t you?” she replied, looking through her own phone, “I mean, look at—” She abruptly stopped speaking, her mouth began to hang open as she checked both her texts and her call log. No evidence of me contacting her.

“But I just—”

I cut my wife off by standing up and asking, while looking her in the eyes, “What time did I call you?”

“I don’t kno—”

“Can you please try to remember?” cutting her off once again.

Jaslyn was silent for a few seconds, then claimed I had called and texted her at around 9, maybe 9:15. This was around the time I had found my phone on top of the bookcase. After calming my wife from her anger-turned-confused state, I explained everything that happened from last night (her disappearing then reappearing) to this morning (my phone being found atop a 9 foot case standing straight up).

So now I’m writing this to ask for some sort of advice on what to do. I’m religious but I don’t really believe in paranormal stuff, and if it is paranormal, why is it happening to me? I’m hoping this is shared exhaustion, something ordinary. I thought writing things down would be a good idea, just in case. I’ll keep you all updated if anything noteworthy occurs.

Also, I called the HVAC company in my area to check for mold and carbon monoxide. I'll let you know if they find anything.
