I'm a freshly graduated college student, with a fancy and proper degree in Agricultural science, heading back to support my family with new ideas and statistically backed theories.See, my family has a large ranch in the rolling plains of Arkansas. It's about 70 acres of fertile fields, green but kept trimmed. The far edge of the property fades into something dead and yellow, frayed branches like they'd been on fire years ago. Me and my cousins always dared each other to go beyond our familiar fields as kids, growing more bold as we got older, but never crossing the threshold.

That was forever ago, before I left them to become the first in my family with a degree. We've always had a tight-knit bond, a farm family cliche, generations living under one roof. I had met  my grandfather at the local airport, an almost entirely wooden structure hidden up in the mountains. With a rolling suitcase sliding behind me, I searched the few reuniting families in the arrival section, my eyes landing on him. It had only been four years since I'd seen him last, but farmers don't exactly age gracefully. What I mean is- the sun and experience weighed down on his face, making his eyes sink into his cheeks, wrinkled yet hollow. His skin was like leather, tanned and thick enough to dull a nail. Whisps of gray hair attempted to bridge the gaps on his scalp, like desperately holding back my family's curse of balding.

Still, it was Grandpa Harvey. Even with the years showing on his face, below those sunken eyes was a typical tight-lipped smile, happy to see me. I jogged awkwardly to his side, where he placed his hand on my shoulder with a few stiff pats.

"Good to see you, boy." His voice drawled, loud and thick, trained from his life of calling cattle and barking orders.

"How's the family? Still.. farmy?" I replied awkwardly, offering a thrawn smile, feeling a little distant despite weekly telephone calls with updates on how business and family were going. Southerners have a way of making you feel real welcome, while excluding you from some inside situation you couldn't puzzle together- and I was feeling more of the ladder.

"Yaw, what else would we be up to?" He chortled loudly. I could feel the vibrato in his voice from the proximity. I kept my smile as he guided my shoulder by his bony hand, dappled with freckles and sunspots. 

He was a lot skinnier than he had been, no longer plump from living off the land- his bones rattled when he walked with an unsteady gait. I couldn't help but cringe slightly as he stifled a wheeze when we descended the stairs into the lobby entrance. We exited the building into warm, summer weather, welcoming and stuffy with humidity. The higher the elevation, the more the air seemed to weigh on your lungs, like swimming deeper into a pool. 

I didn't mind it, it was home- regardless if others considered it uncomfortable. Grandpa Harvey raised a finger, pointing at a group of well-dressed business men and cackling at the sweat beading their thin brows and high cheekbones. 

I stepped onto the sunken lip of his large red pickup, hoisting myself up onto the crackling vinyl seat. He took to the driver side, a bout of a coughing fit obstructing his attempt to turn the engine over. 

It wasn't unusual to watch an older man crumple under his age- but it still felt wrong. The four years I'd been gone seemed to have accelerated his age by decades.

My concern was quickly chased away as he began driving down the mountainside, the old beatup truck rumbling over the road that descended to the valley. The years had melted away instantly as he cracked jokes and shared his gripes of old age. He got in some jabs about how, despite his age, he could still wrestle down our bulls and stallions better than any man younger.

"People now are soft. Wouldn't know a willow from a sycamore." He claimed, with that elderly confidence you couldn't help but admire.

"But we have ideas." I cut in, leaning my forearm on the rolled down window, soaking in the southern breeze as it whipped through my hair. He looked over for a moment, pursing his lips as if considering to argue. He looked warmer in the sunlight of the valley. Maybe it was the airport, with its sterile lights, that made him look so gaunt. He must've decided not to argue, because he waited a long moment before he spoke next.

"You must've learned a lot from schooling. I expect you'll be teaching us now, on how we're going about it all wrong." His words were bitter, like part of him resented me for wanting to take a different path. This was dangerous, when someone older than you set a trap like this. It was a sort of bait, daring you to confirm your doubts, or express that what they interpreted was wrong. I chose the safe option, changing the subject.

"It was good. I think I can really help out now. Before, I wasn't all that useful." I chose my words carefully, knowing the self depreciation would make him consider my opinions.

I was a skinny bastard, gangly and awkward in a family of sturdy and broad farmers. I even remember losing a wrestling match with my thirteen year old cousin, as a twenty-something year old man. My cheeks flushed slightly at the recollection, earning a jab to my shoulder, snapping me out of my thoughts.

"We're here. Welcome back home, son." 

The doors creaked as we got out, the rusty metal trim groaning with age. The expanse of our ranch greeted me like an old friend, slightly withered. Dense thickets shadowed where proud stalks once grew. The weather had been especially dry lately, like the clouds had gotten tired of raining. It wasn't surprising- Arkansas weather often had arid summers. A record high temperature was 115⁰, back when I was a kid. The crops that year died before they could shake the winter frost.

I took a deep breath, the fresh air making my nostrils sting pleasantly. Nothing had changed much, the land stretched infinitely just as before, ending unceremoniously into the dead woods miles away, crooked trees like bones in the distance. The big red and gray barns parallel to the large ranch house were sagging from strong winds, but they still stood proud, albeit faded. An expanding horse pasture adjacent to the gray barn was occupied by gangly, scrawny mustangs. I recognized a few, we've had some since I was born. Their spines jutted from their summer coats, their skin stretched tightly and thin over their bony frames. They nosed through the tall grass, tan muzzles blending in with the sickly ferns as they searched for food.

I followed my grandfather through the winding, hoofbeaten path to the house. He climbed the wooden steps, one at a time, pausing after each one and drawing in a thick breath of air. I pulled my suitcase up over the steps after he had gotten up to the wide porch. I was thankful I hardly had luggage- I think any more weight would cause the unreliable steps to splinter and give way to the dry dirt below. 

The door swung open, the person I had missed most hurrying onto the unsteady wood to pull me into her arms. 

"Oh! Oh, you're here! You're here with us!" Cried my mother, her honey blonde curls of hair bouncing as she squeezed and swayed me in her arms. 

"It was only a few years, mam." I flushed slightly, trying not to melt into her warm embrace and freckled skin. A few squeaky voices barked greetings, the bright blue and green eyes of my cousins peeking from the house. I was the oldest, and I could see the pride in their eyes- someone bigger than them had accomplished something, even if they didn't understand what. 

"Can a mother miss her boy? Oh, those years took decades!" She cried once more, her hazel eyes wet with tears of relief that I had made it back. 

I never understood mother's, they treated anytime you went out like it was some death defying mission you may not come back from. But still, it was nice to know I had been kept in their thoughts. She went on about how they had prayed and missed me at the dinner table, rambling over herself before I could speak. 

Harvey took the handle of my suitcase in his thin hand before I could argue, herding me into the house behind my mother. 

The next few hours felt warm, comfortable. I had almost forgotten about my questions about the farm until we all sat at the dinner table. Me, a dozen cousins, my mother, and my grandfather. Conversation started out casually, my mother asked how college had been, if I'd been eating well. I answered everything with a "Yes'm." or a "No mam." I noticed missing seats at the table, and I interrupted myself mid college anecdote.

"Aunt Sarah, Uncle Smith. Are they in town?" I gestured towards the empty chairs, my words muffled around a spoon full of shepherd's pie.

The excited chatter of the room dimmed down, until all eyes were on me. The youngest of the cousins, 6 and 8, kept talking, until they were hushed with a stroke on the head and a stern look.

My grandfather was the only one who didn't look up. His pools of dark blue eyes were trained on his plate as he chewed quietly on his food, like a cow focusing on digesting cud. My mother gave him a knowing smile, her soft and pink hand resting upon his. Her thumb stroked his bony knuckles.

"Now, that isn't something to worry about. They're around here somewhere." Her words were smooth and carefully chosen. She spoke like she was comforting a kid over a dead goldfish- not quite lying, not admitting truth. It was just sleeping, floating on its back at the surface.

I sensed how thick the air had become, and I nodded instead of prying further. My aunt and uncle always took their time, making sure the animals were fed and put up before night. They must have been leading the horses back into their barn. The pasture became dangerous at night- coyotes and other nocturnal hunters had scaled the fences before, and they'd gone after the years foals or calves before, too. Keeping the animals up was the most responsible course of action- and they cared about the animals a great deal.

Dinner resumed after my mother reassured me, but it was quieter than before, like we were all dancing around my questions. Another southern thing was a sort of hush that followed after someone said something they shouldn't have. Everyone was too stern to be vulnerable, so we left it alone. 

My mother put the younger kids to bed that night, without the help of my aunt. They were rowdy and bubbling with questions for me, but she managed to bribe them with promises of extra pie before bed. The large house was quiet now, the main cause of noise finally settled for the night.

She emerged once more, closing the wooden door of a bedroom behind her softly. She padded over to me, her body hugged by a silky blush colored robe. I was sitting at the table still, across from my grandfather as we soaked in the comfortable silence together. He nursed a beer, tapping his fingers against the glass as I studied the darkening land through the kitchen window. The barns seemed ominous now, looming over the pastures and casting great shadows on the dry grass. The entire land seemed withered. I knew it was full of life, a dozen horses, chickens and cows slept in their stalls- but it all felt empty, like a graveyard in the winter.

She joined us at the table, a sad smile on her face as she studied me and stroked my hair absentmindedly. We remained quiet, until the sound of a wooden chair scraping over the floor startled us. Harvey got up to his unsteady feet, his beer forgotten. His face seemed sunken in the dim kitchen light.

"I'm turnin’ in. Welcome back, Mason.” He touched my shoulder meaningfully, his gaze like he was looking within me, not at me. He lingered for a moment, until I made eye contact, and then he smiled in his tight way and strode down the hallway, to the last door on the wall. It unsettled me, how empty his eyes were. I waited until I heard it close behind him, until I looked at my mom with a silent urgency.

“Sarah n’ Smith still isn't in..” I started, watching my mother's face fall, her grip tightening on my hair for a moment painfully, until she stepped aside. She paused, looking out of the window with her back to me, hands clasped behind her. I swallowed thickly, waiting for a reply as I set my hair back in place.

“It'll be okay.” She said, in a hurried whisper. For a second, in the moonlight dappled reflection, I swear I could see tears. I was pushing her past a level of numbness she must've learned while I was away. And I kept going.

“And pa. He isn't right either. He's skinny. And the horses, too. I saw a lame mare collapse under her own weight. The crops don't look good. The grass is yellow.” I kept going, listing everything I'd noticed in the short time I was back. Once the last word had left my mouth, I knew I should've let it be.

“Mason.” 

She stopped me before I went farther. Her voice was sharp, scolding. I looked up to see her eyes, tears streaming down her cheeks now. She was shaking with something between fury and sorrow. Then her voice shook like the Earth before a storm.

“Do not let them hear you.” She whispered, wiping her eyes until they were raw. She sniffled, replacing her frown with a forced smile to ease the sudden fear I felt. 

“Mason.” She repeated, squeezing my shoulder. “Get some sleep and we can find something nice to do tomorrow. Maybe we can saddle up a horse and take the trails.” Her voice was wavering, her lips shaking from a smile to a frown. 

“That's a good idea, mam.” 

Once I gave a satisfying response, she released my shoulder and walked off, looking once over her shoulder to me with something unreadable, before disappearing down the hall.

I felt uneasy, like something big was hanging over the farm, and everyone could see it but me. 

I counted it up to being lingering jetlag from my earlier flight out of college, a long travel time from Texas. Home always looks different after a long trip, afterall. 

I got into bed, a shared room toward the back of the house with a bunk bed and one normal cot. Two of my older cousins slept on the bunk, and I took the larger bed. The mattress was soft and I sunk into it, my back cradled by the comfortable foam. There was a space between the beds, where a large window sat on the wall, underneath it a small end table with books and paper stacked on it. The moonlight showed a grid on the wooden floor, keeping me awake. In college, my dorm was completely dark with black out curtains, I hadn't had light when sleeping in awhile.

It was very quiet, I could hear my own breathing and the soft snoring of my cousins across the room. A cricket chirped rhythmically for a moment, and then stopped. I counted five chirps, hoping it would maybe lull me to sleep. 

At some point, my eyes were too heavy to keep open, and I fell into a light and restless sleep. It didn't last long, when I woke in the middle of the night, the moon was still just as high in the sky. I tore the quilt off of my legs, deciding I could use some fresh air, and the sealed window wasn't providing it.

I walked slowly and methodically, remembering the least creaky steps to take in order to let everyone else sleep. I made it out quietly, bare feet stepping onto the cool wooden porch. The air was warm and dry, with a cool breeze sifting through. I took a deep breath, welcoming the sweet wind into my lungs.

I smelled something other than the cool night air and grass. Something sweet and wrong, like rotten apples. I didn't bother to slip on boots- the land was too dry and dusty for me to consider it. It's not like I would step in any mud. I stepped down from the porch, and my feet kicked up a small cloud of dust as I walked. The ground was dry and my footsteps hardly made a sound.

Even in the dark, I knew my way to the big, peeling red barn. I could walk the path deaf blind or dazed. I reached the large doors, slightly ajar. The smell was worse now. It assaulted my nose, made my eyes water and my sinuses tingle. It was the kind of sweet, putrid smell that you wanted to huff more of, just to figure out the source. Like old meat.

I pushed open the door with a deafening creak- and what I saw next- I still see when I close my eyes. Flies and other insects who fed on rot scattered at the sudden moonlight, darting past me. I swatted them away frantically, stepping forward as my stomach gurgled.

 I found Aunt Sarah.

What was left of her. The face down body of a woman, wearing a long pleated skirt and work shirt. I would recognize the outfit anywhere- she always wore it when working outside. Her blonde hair was a matted mess on the back of her head. Something between muck and blood oozed beneath her, a rich brown and red color that caked the straw bedding of the floor. It spread through and touched my bare feet with a sickening slosh, like stepping in a mud puddle. She was rotten, for weeks by the smell of it. Her arm stretched out beneath her, the flesh was wrinkled and thin, with flies scattering to pick it over

I couldn't breath, couldn't blink, couldn't move. The next part happened so fast. Something lurched in the darkness, like something wet being dragged across grass. It would pause, then continue. I took one step back, the gore squishing between my toes. It got closer, faster and more determined. I saw a hand sticking out of a familiar flannel sleeve, the tan and thick hand of my uncle, calloused from working the land. The fingers bent, digging into the straw for grip and using the leverage to pull his body further. He wasn't alive. But he moved. He moved like a parasite was controlling him, not like a zombie. He wasn't aware, I could tell. I could tell by the vacant look in his eyes, glazed over and almost entirely white. His mouth hung open, collecting straw as he was dragged.

I remembered something like this- a fungus that possessed ants to exist without consciousness. Like it was something determined, not sure of what. Something hungry.

A scream caught in my throat, something strangled and burning. My feet finally moved without my brain's permission, taking me out of the barn. They pounded against the Earth, taking me back to the house as I continued my guttural wail. I clambered up the porch and shoved the door open, my feet staining the wooden floor. I didn't look back, but I could still hear the wet dragging.

My mother must've heard the sudden commotion, because she emerged from her room, her eyes sullen and too indifferent. I couldn't find the right words, so I just banged my fist on the door frame, pointing outside to the barn. 

She walked forward, slow calm strides that made my stomach turn upside-down. 

“Mason. Were you out with Aunt Sarah and Uncle Smith?” She asked, pursing her lips, almost accusatory.

My words came out fast and hurried. “Mom! They- they're dead. They're dead and they didn't stay dead!”

She put a hand on my shoulder, turning me away from my nightmares, facing the kitchen window. She turned my head with her soft hand on my cheek, making me look out of it, to the woods stretching beyond.

“Mason. The woods are hungry. They've gotten real restless since you've been gone.” She sucked in her cheeks, her hand tightening on my arm. The woods did seem darker than before, like they were eating up our green land and turning it yellow and black. Dead. 

“What?” I asked in a whisper, like I was afraid to know the answer.

The answer came quietly, over the next few hours. She sat with me at the table. She had started a pot of coffee before she sat down, now holding a warm mug between her hands. I had been holding my breath the entire time, but I was grateful the scent of death was replaced with bitter coffee. 

“Now, that's better.” She muttered quietly to herself, taking a noisy sip of the coffee. “I guess it all started the day you left. We were happy for you, but sad. And we didn't keep up our duty.”

“Duty?” 

“Yes, boy. I know you're a smart boy, you've noticed the woods ever since you were young.” She put her hand over mine and rubbed her thumb over it in a gesture of comfort. “You noticed how they stretch out and reach for you. They're a living thing, in a decayed way. They get hungry. We feed them, whatever weak animals we get during spring. In exchange, we get to live off the land.”

I nodded despite not understanding any of it.

This was her sign to continue. “It's been a real dry season. We haven't had much crops to sell, much cows having calves. It's been.. incessant. It stopped taking the weak stillborn foals, and started feeding off our mares. Then the stallions. Then our bulls. And it still wasn't enough..” She paused, letting me fill in the blanks. That explained what happened to her brother and sister.

“That's why grandpa looks so sick.” I assumed, and she nodded gravely.

“Thats right. He's been working over time, trying to save the animals from the sickness. So much so it's got him sick himself.” She looked at me then, and I felt my stomach drop.

“Your cousins are too young to understand. But we're putting them up, somewhere else that's safe. I'll be going with them up North. Your grandfather is sick, Mason. The farm is sick.” She leaned forward, and her tone became pleading.

“You're strong, smart, a real survivor..Like your grandfather. Please, Mason. Please stay and fight the darkness. Feed it. Keep it at bay.”

It was quiet after that. I thought for an eternity, replied in a few seconds.

“I'll keep it away, mom.”

The years went by fast, after I had been tasked with something so heavy. My mother took the youngest of my cousins and moved up North to a small town home, like she said. The older ones went off on their own to school, inspired by my own journey. Grandpa Harvey passed away a few years back, peacefully in his sleep. When the weight was off his shoulders.

And me? Well, I'm in my fifties now. I had my own family with a woman who understood what my duty was. Had kids who had their own kids. I even had a grandson who agreed to take my place.

I got a fancy laptop this Christmas, and my grandkids introduced me to this site, said I should write my story.

I'm sitting on the porch now, the computer in my lap as I type. The woods beyond crept closer by the day, but I kept them in check. I have a cigarette in my lips, my eyes on them. I take a drag as something dark drags the body of a stillborn foal out of sight.
