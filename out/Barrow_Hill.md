I once took a drive up to a place called Barrow Hill, commonly thought to be a myth. It wasn't on any map and I thought I was lost at a few points. I wanted to bring back evidence of the place's existence for a local paper but when I got there, the area was pitch black, save for the lights of my vehicle. I rememeber hearing a faint whisper of...something in the darkness. It was calling me. I don't remember much except for the faint glimpse of pale fangs and skittering in the moonlight and what I thought were webs. Then I heard a small tell tale voice, singing:

*"come into my woods and be joyful lovely, up on the trees where there's no one but me"*

I tensed up as the song got closer:

"*silly little fly with a penchant for pranks, you'll love it up here, no spiders or snakes"*

It was within mere feet of me and spoke in a low gutteral, almost pained voice:

"*Come into my woods and be dinner lovely, no one is around who might hear you scream"*

The hair felt like nails, I saw the pale figure of a monster, silhouetted.

I raced for the car and turned on the headlights. I almost died from shock. In front of me was the biggest spider I had ever seen. It jumped on the hood as I hit the accelerator. Braking hard, it flew off the hood and I gunned it for home. I think I went past 60 miles per hour and I'm pretty sure I broke a few laws here and there but I couldn't get the image out of my head. I got home and barred the door, kept all the lights on and called the cops, claiming there was a robbery in progress. Then I heard the voice again, right next to me, in a low whisper:

"*Come into my woods and be joyful lovely, up in the trees where there's no one but me*"

I turned around slowly and screamed. My wife came racing downstairs with a can of Raid and sprayed the creature until it was dead. She then hugged me but i still felt unease for some reason.

"It's ok" she told me, as I looked at the body of the dead spider. I vomited out of fear and disgust then put our baby to bed. As we got ready for bed ourselves, I recounted by experiences to my disbelieveing wife.

"You wouldn't believe half of my day. I found a certain place called Barrow hill and the spider spoke in the most peculiare pattern. I believe it used a common song we sung as kids"

My eyes shot open and it hit me. It was in the room with me, but where.

*oh god no*

My wife turned to me and whispered in my ears:

"I was at Barrow Hill"

My blood ran cold as the lights went off for the last and final time.
