there was one night during my first year at a university, I was studying physics, and at night, would take long walks at night with fellow first year physic students, which we called night walks.

these would usually last for an hour before we go back, and consisting of 3-4 people. this night, it was just with my bud, Alex. Alex was a good guy, and during the walk we talked about a lot of things, until we suddenly got a message to go back to the university for a party, probably because it was almost winter break.

Alex left first, while I got some food from the store. then, I saw a homeless person that was doing something, I couldn't tell what he was doing, but since it was a really cold night, and the homeless guy didn't seem to have anything else to wear, I gave him all my spare change of 5$. he didn't say anything though.

I walked away from the store, and after walking for around 30 meters, I suddenly got jumped by him. he was really strong, and started to beat me up really badly, and said that he would rob me, kill me, and throw me down a river so they don't know how I died. he said this with one of the creepiest laughs of all time, and I thought I was about to die and that moment. 

I tried using all my strength, but I wasn't planning on rolling in the snow, and staying out for that long, I tried calling for help but no one heard me as I was in the dead of night, also the homeless person was covering my mouth. 

after 15 minutes of tackling I was still somewhat alive. I could barely breath, can thought I was about to past out. then I had an idea. during all this time, I was rolling around in the snow to get his hands ice cold, and now as the wind was coming in, I decided to pretend I'm died,  so he could stop punching me.

then, he would drag me to rather somewhere, or dump my body down the stream. I was so focused on surviving I somehow didn't think about such a plan. worse case scenario he actually ends me before dumping me to the river, but if so, I could surprise attack him. 

thankfully he fell for the bait, and I quickly fell asleep in the forest. when I woke up, I was still very injured, and using the last of my strength to call the university security guards. they quickly rushed me to the infirmary where I rested for the whole day. 

they soon set out a hunt to see where the homeless guy was before he harms others, which they did find after a long 3 day manhunt. apparently he was an ex murderer, and was sentenced to jail for many years before going out.

nobody wants an Ex-murderer, so he tried to find some jobs, but after a quick look at his history, they all said no, so he soon became broke and started using drugs to calm himself. I would have most likely died or at least be seriously injured, but as of now, I am back to exactly who I was. I'm just grateful that they caught him, as many others would have been hurt or worse from him.
