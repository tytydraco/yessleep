It was a cloudless night. I didn’t hear anything from through the walls since I had gotten home. I didn’t do much that night, I was thinking, anticipating something, I don’t know what... before I knew it, it was past time for me to go to bed.

I was in my bed, staring at the ceiling, I took an extra dose of melatonin but it didn’t seem to be doing much. My eyes fluttered... I was just on the verge of drifting off, when without warning, there was a thump, and then banging, like someone was slamming something on the floor in Carrie’s apartment. It was violent at first, and then it became gentle... I listened closely, very closely, bringing my head up against the wall, because I heard something very quiet, very subdued... someone muttering, Carrie I think, it almost sounded like her, but different somehow and it sounded like she was on the verge of crying, desperately pleading for something, and then... it started again.

The “crying”. That nightmarish noise unlike anything I’ve ever heard. I jumped back from the wall, blasted by another splitting headache, and put the pillow over my head, tried to blot out the sound.

It was like a whole army was whistling as loud as they could, and screaming, firing at each other, and all that noise sounded like it was being blasted through crackling speakers. It was like there was a windstorm in there, a windstorm full of damned souls.

It wasn’t human. Whatever was making that noise wasn’t human.

Dozens of horrifying images flashed through my mind as I cowered in my bed, wondering why nobody else heard it, why nobody did anything, I wondered what was lurking just a few feet behind that wall, what Carrie had birthed, what she had done, how, why, why was this happening to me? What sort of gnarling, squirming inhuman shape was she keeping in there?

The noise eventually died down, and the silence that followed was absolutely deafening. I wondered if Carrie was alive,if her monstrous child had eaten her or who knows what. But I wasn’t going to dare to get out of bed, I couldn’t, I was utterly frozen in place, both my body and mind.

Then, that man in the weird clothes popped in my head. I wondered if that was the father. I wondered what it was. What the hell it was. I remembered the glow, the black and white static that swirled...What was squirming under all that covering? And why, how, why did Carrie...?It made me sick thinking about it.

I think I might have fallen asleep an hour before I had to wake up, curled up in the fetal position.

I told myself it was a dream when I woke up. That didn’t work, so I told myself I was crazy. When I ran by Carrie’s apartment and bumped into some other tenants at the bottom of the stairs, they were just chatting like nothing had happened the previous night, like some hellspawn hadn’t been squealing in the middle of the night. I’m telling you, it’s impossible that they couldn’t have heard it. I even asked them straight up if they had heard anything, even though I was already running late for work. They looked at me like I was insane. I wished I was insane.

But when I came home as the sun was setting, and passed by Carrie’s window,a shadow slunk down from behind the curtains. I don’t know what drove me to get closer, but I snapped my head in the direction of the motion and stepped up to the glass. The curtains were shaking gently, like something was brushing against them. I got closer, closer, and then I jumped back. Those weren’t human fingers I saw. It wasn’t any sort of animal. They drew back again, and I heard something thumping rapidly away from the window. I stared, frozen, and something stared back, two circles of light that I could see through the blinds, on the other side of the room, light that spiraled and spun, a black and white glow...

I rushed into my apartment, slammed the door and locked it.

I thought of calling the police, even dialed the number but didn’t hit call a few times. But they would think I was crazy. Nobody else had heard it. Anyone else I went to would think I was crazy too. I should have just called them then anyway, made up some excuse that I heard someone screaming for help or whatever, force them to unveil whatever was lurking in there.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Around 1am, right when all the noise of passing cars and everything died down completely outside, when it was very quiet... I heard a tiny thump through the wall.

Again, I pressed my ear against it, because I could just barely make out something else... a squelching sound, a sound like something was tearing into something, into meat... more thuds. I listened in disgust, imagining just what the hell was behind there, when my head was jolted. I fell back off the bed and cursed. Something had knocked on the wall. It was knocking, thumping again, the walls were shaking with each thud, and I backed up on all fours to the corner of my room. It knew I was listening. It knew I was listening, and it was sending some kind of message.

I heard something else scuffling, there was sobbing and pleading, desperate rapid pleading... and then the noise that couldn’t be produced by anything of this earth began again.

That was the final straw for me, I called the police. Told them I heard the couple next door fighting.

I asked them if they could hear the noises as I screamed over it all, but they replied in the negative.

There was no fucking way, I’m telling you.

The noises stopped five minutes later. Two minutes after that, two cops walked up to the apartment, one knocked on my door and the other on Carrie’s.

The cop questioned me, I told him I heard screaming and banging, a baby crying. The other one knocked on the door again... and it swung open. It had been ajar.

Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Nobody was home.

I asked them to show me, hysterically. They refused at first, but I was so persistent and the poor guys looked tired, so they caved in and agreed.

It smelled awful inside. There were dozens of dirty dishes in the sink, the place was a fucking mess, food and random garbage strewn everywhere. There were dirty blankets piled all over the couch in a bundle. But there was nobody home. Her bedroom door was open. They didn’t take me in there but they assured me nobody was there either. They questioned me a little bit more. I know they thought I was crazy.

My mind worked itself like mad after they left. I didn’t sleep at all. I didn’t hear anything after they left.

I’m writing this now, 10am, glad I don’t have to work today. I still haven’t heard anything at all since last night. Whatever is going on, whatever happened... I’m sure my neighbour’s baby isn’t a human baby. I don’t know what it could possibly be, whether she made a pact with a demon or an alien or something from another fucking dimension or I don’t know. I have no idea. Any theories I have just seem insane, just make me feel more insane than I already am. I wrote this down, hoping to post it somewhere, hoping someone would have some kind of answer. I don’t expect an answer, but... please...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Everything preceding this was written a few days ago. Everything after, I’ve written today.

The truth is something I never would have been able to guess. You’ll just have to believe me. I don’t blame you if you don’t, I don’t even believe what my own eyes have seen. And I guess I still don’t really know what the truth is exactly, or understand it, not at all.

After I had finished writing everything, I decided not to post it. I kept telling myself I was just going nuts, thought of trying to find a psychiatrist, mostly just sat around like I was dead inside instead of actually doing something on my day off.

I had my blinds closed, a chair pinned up against my door. I sat in the corner, watching the sun slowly set, watching dark clouds seep in like tar, watching the world beyond my blinds slowly descend into darkness. And I was listening the whole time... waiting for that hellish sound to start again... hoping that whatever was in there wasn’t going to come back, or wasn’t going to come outside...

I woke up with a jump. I don’t know when I fell asleep, but my apartment was pitch black. I turned on my phone, the time was one in the morning, my battery was on 1% and I cursed as it shut off a second later. I went to get my charger, when I froze mid-movement. Thump, thump, thump. Something was moving in Carrie’s apartment. It was back, if it had ever left, if it was even there to begin with.

I ignored it. It was just Carrie,I was over-exaggerating. It had to be. Everything else had been a dream or insanity. I kept repeating to myself that I was just insane, desperately trying to convince myself, when an earsplitting scream,a woman’s voice a shrill cry for mercy tore through the air, was pierced by sharp whistling, whistling that warped into that same indescribable sound that haunted me before, that denied all denials. I covered my ears, trembled and dropped to my knees, and wished I was anywhere else. It was real. I didn’t care how or why nobody else heard it, it was happening. I screamed with it.

It sounded like a month’s worth of squeals and whirring machinery from a slaughterhouse was being played through a loud-speaker all at once, mixed with the roaring of some kind of screeching big cat, and a dying motor. And there was that horrible pleading from Carrie, too, mixed in the noise, muffled by it, and this time I could hear part of what she was saying, “Please... no! Calm down! Please stop! Don’t make me- my baby, please!”

I opened my shut eyes, wished I could close them again but I couldn’t because they were utterly entranced by the sight outside my curtains, by *the glow*, more intense than it had ever been before, swirling and twisting like hundreds of white and black snakes, or fat worms wriggling together.

I dug my nails into my ears, the noise wouldn’t stop, and I realized then that if I didn’t do *something,*then I would go insane if I wasn’t already. I think I might have been at that moment. I was seized by mania, I jumped up, stomped to my drawer, hauled out a big kitchen knife, moved the chair out of the way, ripped my door open and brought my arm up to block the glow from my eyes, even just seeing it at the corner of my eyes was enough to give me a headache that felt like my temples were being hammered through with rusty nails. I stumbled to Carrie’s door, shut my eyes, blinked and when I had opened them the glow was fading, slinking away like a living thing, but the “crying” was even louder. I bit my lip, tried the door, it clicked and opened slightly, and then all noise stopped.

The silence within weighed down on me like a trillion bricks.

It was dark inside. I stood in the doorway, blinking, trying to pierce through the dark. I didn’t see anyone, or anything. Gingerly, I took my first step.

Everything was still a mess. I almost tripped over a baby bottle, realized there were dozens of empty baby bottles, baby formulas, and empty amazon packages scattered around, and in the half-ajar doorway to Carrie’s bedroom, was a face. Carrie was staring at me, like a deer caught in head-lights. All I could see was her face, her mouth dropped open, her eyes wide in what must have been terror.

I thought her eyes were trained on the knife in my hands, “This isn’t...” I stuttered, “Look, I just heard something and I was coming to see if...” I trailed off as she slunk back into the room.

I really thought I was insane then. That settled it for me. I was going to see a psychiatrist or lock myself up or something before I hurt someone. I wanted to get out of there as fast as possible.

My foot bumped into something again on my way out. Something rigid. The bundle of blankets on the couch slipped off, revealing what I had bumped into. I blinked, it was hard to tell what it was in the dark, and it looked like... a foot. Slowly, my eyes scanned up the leg. Someone was halfway underneath the couch, and they were completely still. Dead still.

I moved the couch, it was light, and uncovered something that made my entire body fill with goosebumps, that made a frigid snake crawl its way down my spine. An unbelievably rank smell assaulted my nose, and I turned away and retched onto the floor.

Carrie had been under the couch. She was dead, I don’t know for how long. Her body was rotting. I’d never seen a dead body before in real life, not of someone I knew, not in that state, not ever... and I was so filled with disgust and shock that it took a minute of trying not to vomit before my scrambled brain realized:

*Didn’t I just see her peering at me from the bedroom?*

I rubbed my eyes that had become teary from throwing up. It was her! Then who the fuck was in the bedroom? *What* the fuck was in the bedroom? Slowly, very slowly, I turned my head, my brain screaming at me not to look, my body fighting against me, trying to hold me back from seeing what was in there. I heard something moving behind me, something squelching, sucking... I snapped my head all the way towards the source.

The door was open. There was nobody in the bedroom. There wasn’t anybody in the room with me either. At least, not any*body* as I had ever conceived it in all my years on this earth.

It had Carrie’s face, but it definitely wasn’t Carrie. Her face was the first thing I saw, none of the rest of it was even remotely human, her face was but a mask tacked on to something that shouldn’t exist. That empty mask watched me from above, its spreading body clinging to the ceiling as it inched closer. It was a swirling, writhing mass of a matter I don’t even know how to describe, with a consistency unlike anything I’ve ever seen, and it opened Carrie’s mouth, and it spoke, with her voice, “Please, my... mommy, don’t take mommy...”

I fell on my ass. I think I might have pissed myself there. My jaw dropped and I just sat there limply.

White lines of light coursed along its body, Carrie’s eyes were drowned with black light, “Mommy, please... I’ll do anything, please just don’t... I want... to.... mommy... my baby...” the face twitched, its mouth opened wider and wider until her lips split at the seams, her jaw widening until it couldn’t widen anymore, until it just folded on itself *and then there was light*. White and black swirling light, white noise that made me want to cover my eyes but I couldn’t move, couldn’t move a damn inch. The thing was covering the whole ceiling, and it kept pleading in Carrie’s voice, like it was playing a recording, and the voice gargled and warped until it turned into *the cries* I had heard the past four nights. Its whole mass vibrated, faster and faster until it looked like it wasn’t in motion at all, but I could feel the whole fucking room shaking, my ears felt like they’d pop, my head felt like a vice had crushed my skull, like someone had taken my brain out and put it in a blender and then shoved it back in. The white and black encroached upon me and then everything went black. It must have only been a second. I was screaming long after the noise had stopped, I didn’t even realize it had stopped.

The white and black glow retreated into the thing’s center, and an enlarged version of Carrie’s face emerged from the dark pool of its body, like a whale breaching the surface of the ocean. The face twitched and shrunk back to its normal size, and the thing started begging me not to hurt its baby again and again.

I started backing away, kicking at the ground, I remembered then that the knife was in my fucking hands and I started swinging it wildly in the air as the thing started to drip down onto the floor, splitting itself apart and recollecting itself in front of me. I say dripping, but its consistency wasn’t quite liquid, it was like it was made up of tiny squares, breaking apart and reforming, like pixels on a computer screen. But even then, that isn’t right. Carrie’s eyes on the thing melted, spilled out some white stuff that opened up into mouths, and both the mouths started crying again, I almost drove the knife into my own skull to stop the rattling but instead somehow managed to get up, I swung the knife but missed, it slipped out of my sweating hand and clattered to the ground and I just screamed. The thing was lumbering towards me, but it stopped suddenly.

Crying. A baby crying.

Coming from the bedroom.

The thing spun around, started to twist and turn its amorphous form towards the bedroom. Its body was solidifying as it did so, becoming ever so much more like Carrie’s. But it was imperfect, like a crappy dollar store Halloween costume of my neighbor. It stopped when it reached the door, because I had picked up the knife, and drove it deep into its back. It kept its focus ahead, a white liquid dripped slowly out of where I had stabbed it as both of us froze at the sight in the bedroom.

Compared to the state of the living room, the bedroom was tidy. There was a crib next to Carrie’s bed, and inside... was a healthy baby boy. Its cries, normal cries, briefly ceased when it saw the thing that had melded itself into a mockery of Carrie.

I had thought that thing was the “baby”. I thought my neighbor's baby wasn’t human, but...

But, the thing quickly rushed towards the crib, completely ignoring me, the knife slipped out harmlessly and clattered to the ground. I just slumped against the door-frame, the sight before me even more incomprehensible than anything else that had happened that night.

The thing had picked the baby up, and was cradling it in its arms. The baby was momentarily soothed, but started crying again, it whined when it looked at me. The thing opened its mouth wide, and that awful nightmarish screeching sounded again, I held my hands up to cover my ears, was about to rush towards the baby and throw everything away to try and take it out of the clutches of that thing, but...

The baby started giggling. It was almost instantly soothed, the sound... seemed to be calming it down. It went to sleep with a smile on its face. The thing quieted down and kept rocking the baby back and forth, its fake lips twitching violently. It was like it forgot I was there, completely absorbed in... caring for the baby. I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t even understand. Its lips kept twitching, and though I didn’t understand what was happening at the time, I realize now... it was trying to smile too. It was difficult for it, but for just a split second, it managed a smile. A real smile.

It set the baby in the crib, content that it was sleeping again, and it jumped when it turned around and remembered there was an intruder. An intruder in its abode.

“I...” that was all I uttered, speechless.

“Mommy, please...” it repeated, “My baby... please, don’t hurt my baby...” the words had the exact same intonation as what it had said previously, “I want to be a mommy... please... don’t take my baby from me... or if you’re going to... then...”It really was like a recording, but almost like a parrot mimicking a human’s voice. Some of the words it repeated sounded out of order, scrambled, melded together. I turned back at the corpse in the living room, then back to the thing. My heart fluttered with an indescribable feeling.

There were tears in the thing’s eyes, in the copy of Carrie’s eyes, “Please... if you’re going to kill me... please take care of my baby...” the tears were flowing freely.

“I will,” I don’t know why I said that. I surprised myself, “I’ll make sure its safe.”

The thing nodded, reached out an arm that was on the verge of melting and deforming, patted the sleeping infant on the head, and turned back to me, “Make sure its safe.”

It said that in my voice, exactly like I had just said.

“Make sure its safe,” it repeated itself a few times.

I just nodded.

It started sobbing violently, its disguise utterly collapsed, and then it started to sing. I can’t call it singing as we know singing, there was nothing about it that was really melodious, but I’m sure it was singing. A melancholy goodbye.

The whole room was overtaken by white and black static.

I wish I could tell you what exactly had happened, how or why. What the thing was, why it had done what it had done. Where it came from. I have my own theories, but I really have no idea. It still feels unbelievable to me, and I witnessed it first hand. I still second guess if I’m actually insane. Maybe I’m just in some padded cell somewhere.

I think that thing was inside Carrie’s apartment either the day she came back with the baby, or before, and something had happened to Carrie. Maybe the thing had killed Carrie, I don’t know. But for whatever reason, whether through Carrie’s pleading (which I think the thing was repeating) or a reason I don’t understand... it had tried to care for the baby. If more of those things lurk somewhere in the shadows of our world, I pray they are as benign as the one that tried all it could to care for a human child...

I think it realized it couldn’t work out, in the end.

The baby is safe. I woke up tucked in Carrie’s bed. The baby was in the crib, sleeping soundly. There was no sign of the thing. Carrie’s body was gone, too.

I ended up telling the police that I heard a baby screaming in what sounded like pain, and I found the door to the apartment open. The baby’s with the police, and I hope to God it has a long healthy life, a life that will make its mother, and its adoptive mother from another dimension or wherever proud.
