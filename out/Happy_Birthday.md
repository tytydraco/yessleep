It was 10 PM, and my birthday was almost over. Almost 22 hours had passed, and Luke still hadn’t contacted me. Three whole days of silence—not a single text, call, or explanation. Did he really have the nerve to let my birthday slip away like this?

At first, I thought he might be planning a surprise. I told myself, "He’s just busy organizing something amazing." But the more time passed, the more that hope dimmed, leaving behind a suffocating mix of anger and sadness.

As the hours ticked by, that hope turned into anger. By now, I’d given up. I picked up my phone and started typing, pouring my frustration into the words.

> If u even bother showing up 2morrow, don’t. We’re DONE.

The words sat heavy on the screen. My thumb hovering over the send button, resentment bubbling in my chest. 

Before I could press it, my phone buzzed.

An unknown number flashed on the screen. My stomach tightened.

---

> Unknown: hi, miss me? 😉

My breath hitched. It had to be Luke.

> Me: Luke? Where tf u been? U ignored me for DAYS!

> Unknown: chill babe, been working on smth special for u 😉

Special? After three days of silence? He was seriously playing this off?

> Me: u ghosted me. now u wanna act like it’s no big deal? smth special better b good.

> Unknown: just trust me. U wanted a surprise, right?

My hands trembled as I typed. The audacity of him to act so casual after everything!

> Me: surprise? it’s 10 PM, Luke. 2 hrs til my bday’s OVER. where r u?

This time, there was a pause before his reply.

> Unknown: look outside.

I frowned, my stomach twisting. Slowly, I walked over to the window and peeked out.

There, under the faint glow of the streetlamp at the crossroads, stood a figure. The light casting long shadows across the pavement. A man in a dark hoodie and a mask that covered most of his face waved at me. 
 
> Me: why tf u wearin a mask? u sick or smth?

> Unknown: kinda. anyway, left ur gift outside ur door. go grab it 😊

I glanced back at the crossroads, but the man was gone. My unease deepened. Why wouldn’t he just hand it to me? Why the mask?

Still, curiosity won. I opened the front door cautiously, and there it was—a black box wrapped neatly with a red bow.

I looked around the street one more time before bringing it inside.

---

Back in my room, I locked the door. The box sat on my desk, its perfect wrapping almost mocking me. Slowly, I untied the ribbon and lifted the lid.

I gasped, stumbling back.

Inside the box was a head.

Luke’s head.


It was disturbingly lifelike. His features were so perfect—his messy brown hair, the slight scar on his forehead. But the skin felt... off. My fingers brushed against the skin, and it felt rubbery, hollow. Like a doll stuffed with soft material. 

But the resemblance was so perfect it made my stomach churn.

I couldn’t look at it anymore. I turned the head to face the wall and stepped back, trying to breathe through the rising panic in my chest. My phone buzzed again, the same unknown number flashing on the screen.

I answered, my voice shaking. “What the hell is wrong with you? Do you think this is funny?”

His voice came through the line, calm and steady.

“Do you like it?”

“No, I don’t like it! Who in their right mind would think this is okay? After ignoring me for days, I thought you’d do something thoughtful—something that showed you cared. But this? This is disgusting!”

His reply was colder now, his tone unsettling.

“But you said you liked me. You said I was all you wanted. That nothing else mattered but us.”

“That’s different! This is—”

“You said you liked me. You said you liked me. YOU SAID YOU LIKED ME!”

The line went dead.

But the voice didn’t stop.

It wasn’t coming from the phone anymore.

It was in the room.

I turned slowly toward the head. The desk trembled beneath it as the voice grew louder, more frantic.

The head turned on its own.

Its eyes snapped open, bloodshot and filled with fury. Its lips twisted into a grotesque snarl, repeating the words like a chant.

“You said you liked me. YOU SAID YOU LIKED ME!”

I screamed, backing away until my back hit the wall. My mind scrambled for answers, but nothing made sense.

“Luke!” I cried out, tears streaming down my face. “If this is about Daniel—if this is because I kissed him—I’m sorry! It didn’t mean anything!”

Daniel.

It was a mistake. A stupid, impulsive mistake at a party last week. I’d kissed him—just for a moment—and regretted it instantly. I hadn’t told Luke. I hadn’t told anyone.

But somehow, he knew.

The head stopped. The voice shifted, low and mocking.

“Oh, sweetie. It’s not about Daniel. He doesn’t matter. It’s always been just you and me.”

I stared in horror as the base of the head began to twist and shift. Something pale and fleshy emerged from where his neck should have been.

“You see, I made arrangements,” the head continued, its tone almost cheerful now. “A special doctor. Someone who could...preserve me. Clone me. But the process wasn’t finished in time. Only my head is ready. For now.”

My stomach churned as the base of the head began to twist and shift. Something pale and fleshy sprouted from the neck.

Feet.

Small, childlike feet, growing longer with every passing second.

“This is my gift to you,” the head said, its voice growing softer, almost tender. “Me. Forever. Now, nothing can separate us.”

I pressed myself against the wall, shaking, as the impossible unfolded before my eyes. The head—Luke’s head—was growing a body.

I turned to run, but his voice stopped me cold.

“Happy birthday, baby.”
