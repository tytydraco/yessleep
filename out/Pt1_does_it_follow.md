Every time I try to write this something winds up happening and I lose everything

When I was a little girl I've seen things since I was a little It was always choked off as an active imagination. Well my dad joined the military and we moved to Oklahoma I sent him a boy named Johnnie. He was mean to all the kids But he warmed up to me. Well at this time my dad was overseas so my mom took care of the house and me. During This time I would sneak Johnnie into the house and we would play. One day Johnnie said he can't come in. I was confused did my mom catch us did his mom say he cannot play. Well I didn't understand he didn't want to explain all he said was he can no longer come in a man won't let him but it was only me and my mom. By this time I say if you don't want to play with me you can just say that you don't have to lie cuz I thought he was lying we want our separate ways and we stopped talking well one day my dad came home from overseas. 

I remember my mom coming from down the stairs keep in mind you have a top floor the bottom floor and a basement. She was coming from the top floor and she said honey grab the camera and take a photo he's behind me I can feel him my dad picked up the camera and took a photo and I remember watching I asked can I see after my mom and dad looked at it they were stunned they caught something according to what they said well soon after they explain to me there's a thing called the afterlife and they are known as Souls Spirits ghosts and whatever you believe in basically that would be in the afterlife of a human being. 

I remember the man wearing a Confederate uniform and standing behind my mom that was the first experience I actually had with understanding what I was looking at. Well fast forward my 7th birthday majority of everyone was out front and out front it was surrounded by fence so no one had to worry about kids running into the road and even then the road was not even busy majority of the time just people coming and going to their house which keep in mind is basically connected to ours it's one stripper Road followed by a nice good strip of houses all connected while by wall. 

And an important piece of information is my grandma from Texas came up to Oklahoma to visit us for my birthday especially since two of her children lived in a whole Oklahoma her daughter, my mother and my uncle, her son. I remember she put her purse in my room because I knew and everyone knew we were all going to be downstairs and my room was the farthest from the bathroom and stairs so there was no reason for anyone to go near that room. Well I remember being out front and playing with the kids and I remember one of my toys were in my room and I wanted to bring it down for the other kids to play with to me it was a cool toy for the game that we were playing we were forgot what we were playing but we were playing a game so I go upstairs and I get the toy well by the time I'm on the front porch going down the porch stairs we hear my grandma screaming. 

Majority of the people stay back telling their kids not to go and I escape I run up the stairs and I see my grandma banging on my bedroom door I asked my grandma what's going on she tells me there's a kid stuck in the room you can hear the kid crying behind the door well my parents are already up the stairs and she re-explains to them what she told me you can hear the little boy saying help me I'm locked inside don't leave me the only thing is I was 7 years old and my parents were all about safety so my door did not have a lock but somehow the door was locked my mom couldn't open the door she told the boy let go of the handle because if you hold the handle and the other person holds the handle there ain't no way turning the door handle and he just Carries On crying help me I'm locked inside don't leave me doesn't even acknowledge my mom by this time my dad tries and he's getting frustrated because he does not understand how is a door locked without a lock so he thinks the kids playing and my dad's not one for these games. 

Well he can't get the door he tries to break the door down or push it open by running into it he can't get it open so he tells me to go get Mr Smith his battle buddy I run down the stairs and yell Mr Smith my dad needs you someone stuck in my room him and I run up the stairs as I ignore everyone behind me and I remember them breaking the door open by again slamming into it together when I tell you as a 7-year-old I had chills down my body I had chills as if I was cold cuz I didn't understand what I saw. 

Everything was normal the closet was empty the window was shut and locked the door had no lock but my grandma's purse was wide open and there was no one in the room the little boy was not there soon after the party was canceled a few adults stay to understand the situation others took their kids home. Towards the end of the day when everyone finally left I remember my mom walking up to me and saying I should have believed you we soon found out there was a little boy named Johnny who died in a house fire during or before the Civil War. The only reason people know this is one I was not the only one that has gone through this the little boy would relive this entire thing throughout each house that was connected and rumor has it his soul Still Remains in those houses but does it truly because soon after I move to Alaska and things got weird I'll put it in the next story but we believe it still follows to this day and we don't believe it's a little boy
