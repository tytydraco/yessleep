I’m in shellshock. 

Genuinely, I don’t know how to put this into words. But hell, I’ve recounted it enough times to the police that I know it by heart right now. What’s one more time?

It was morning, I dunno, maybe ten or eleven? I was at work, doing phone sales for an asset manager on the east coast. I liked it, it wasn’t too challenging, and outside having to wear a clunky headset and listen to entitled clients yap all day, it was a pretty sweet deal. Good hours and good pay. 

It must’ve been closer to ten because I’d just wrapped up my second call. Usually the ones in the morning weren’t too bad, with clients usually just coming in for a name change or an address change on their account, something simple to start the day. But today wasn't one of those days. Nope, I’d been saddled with some old entitled bitch who’d had nothing better to do than yell at me. I remember I was pretty dang relieved when I finally had the opportunity to hit the disconnect button, leaning back in my chair as I let the exasperation wash over me.

Calls like that were the worst. You couldn’t exactly run away, and when your job revolved around professionalism and customer satisfaction, you were forced there to sit there and take your licks. I recall sighing as I sunk further into my comfy office chair, happy that I wasn’t on the line with her anymore. In a moment of anger, I tore the headphones off my head, giving them a limp toss towards my desk, my little act of defiance a way of getting some of that negative energy out. I snickered as I heard the clatter of cheap foreign-manufactured plastic crash down against my desk.

I figured I had at least five minutes to hang out in after-call-work, the wonderful medium that separated me from being back in the queue, ready to take on the next annoying old biddy. I slipped my phone from my pocket, flicking it on and browsing the various social media apps I had on my phone. I stayed like that for a while, content to just type and text. Now, I’d never been an eavesdropper, but when you worked in a glorified call center, sometimes you just couldn’t help it. The sales floor always had a rumbling buzz about it, the combined noise of over forty different sales representatives desperately trying to convince some poor shmucks they needed what we were selling. It was excellent white noise, but when you were close to someone, you could usually make out what specifically they were communicating.

My victim for today was Brian, my cubicle mate stationed just three or four feet from me. He was on a call, heck, my whole team was. It was our job after all. Whatever call he was on, he seemed pretty optimistic about it, and to tell you the truth I was rooting for him to close the sale. Every sale mattered, and with the quota looming over our heads, we always tried to back each other up. 

So I sat there, content to hang out and listen to his call as he ran the client through different types of 401ks, IRAs, and the various products we offered like a pro. But despite my contentment, I could feel the clock beginning to tick, and after a few beats I rolled my desk chair back towards my cubicle, steeling myself for my return to the queue. 

I went to reload my webpages, making sure the software was working to prevent any untimely crashes. I went to click out of one of the stale pages, and paused. My mouse had clicked. Now, it wasn’t the fact that the device specifically designed to make a clicking sound clicked that surprised me, but it was that I *heard* it.

I paused, my hand hovering over my mouse. Something was wrong. Well, wrong wasn’t the word. Something was *weird*.

Or rather it was the lack of something.

No, as I went to open up new tabs I came to a strange realization. The sales floor was *quiet*. Quiet enough that I was able to hear my mouse click. I know it’s hard to picture, but for someone that’s been surrounded by the non-stop chatter of a sales team, it was bizarre. No, it was almost unsettling just how quiet it was. It wasn’t that it had just gotten quieter, no, there was *no* noise coming from anywhere.

I tried to brush it off at first. I mean, meetings happen, right? Maybe I’d just missed one on the calendar. But when I checked my schedule for the current timeblock, my eyes widened slightly.

It was empty. There was nothing scheduled to go on right now.

I wheeled around in my chair, unable to shake the weird feeling, the creaking of the chair slicing through the silence that had descended over the floor. My gaze fell on Brian, who was still on the call he was working through earlier. I could tell by the way the light on his webpage was green. It was green for on a call, orange for on hold, and gray for offline. But the fact that he was still on the line with someone wasn’t what scared me. It was his expression.

He gazed directly into his left most monitor, leaning forward slightly as he sat there, frozen. As far as I could tell, he wasn’t moving at all, the only motion coming from the way his chest lightly rose and fell as he breathed. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as my eyes roved over his still figure. It didn’t matter if you were on hold or talking to a client, when you were on the line, you moved. Whether it was spinning in your chair, gesturing with your hands to accentuate a point, etc. But no, he was completely motionless as he continued to blankly stare into the monitor.

“Hey, dude,” I began, confused. “You good?”

If Brian heard me, he didn’t respond, electing instead to continue looking forward. I tried everything, even scooting forward and snapping a few times near his face. Nothing. Feeling a bit creeped out, I wheeled my chair back, ducking outside my cubicle to check out the rest of the team. From where I was seated I could see about half of them, and to my horror, they were no different from Brian.

Frozen in place, staring with empty eyes into their screens. I stood, my chair scraping back as I rose to my full height, peering over the top of my space to gaze further across the floor, looking at the institutional sales department. The sight of just their heads locked in whatever position they were in had my heart hammering against my ribcage. The sound of my own heartbeat the only noise I could hear as the deafening silence hung in the air, smothering me.

Everyone was rooted to their spots.

I flopped back down in my chair, my skin beginning to itch uncomfortably as my brain tried to make sense of what I was seeing. The scrape of an office chair shook me out of my stupor as I latched on to the first sound that I hadn’t made cut through my thoughts.

When I found the source of it, I felt my heart begin to race even faster.

Brian wasn’t sitting down anymore. No, he was standing ramrod straight, staring blankly ahead, his headphones still perfectly perched on his head. But he wasn’t the only one. The floor was suddenly filled with the sound of creaking chairs as more representatives stood. Raquel, Terrance, Jon, Leonard, before long every single member of my team was standing, just as frozen in place as they had been when they were seated.

I scrambled back, unable to keep my fear responses at bay any longer. Something was seriously wrong. It was like my eyes could process what they were seeing but my brain couldn’t make anything of it. 

“B-Brian?” I asked, but it sounded like more of a plea as the name left my mouth, my tone brittle as I tried some of the names of people on my team.

Not a single one of them responded. To my surprise, I found myself terrified of what would happen if I looked away from them. But after mustering up a bit of courage, I managed a quick look over the wall of my cubicle back towards the other department. I felt my stomach flip as I saw they too were standing.

What the hell was going on?

I wasn’t sure, but I sure as hell wasn’t going to stick around to find out. At that moment, a decision was made. I needed to get out of there. But just as I went to leave my cubicle, I detected motion from the corner of my eye. Not just any kind of motion, fast motion. Continuous. I spun around rapidly, making sure I wasn’t about to be attacked, my mind not exactly thinking rationally. 

But what I saw was much, much worse. 

I shuddered, a ragged gasp bubbling past my lips as the hairs on the back of my neck stood straight up. Brian wasn’t standing still anymore. No, he was shifting his weight from foot to foot. Left to right and back again constantly. His shoulders moved too, smoothly rocking back and forth as he began to sway. His eyes were open, still gazing into nothingness as he gracefully shifted back and forth, his arms curling as he moved. His neck lolled from side to side as his fingers flexed at odd intervals.

But it wasn’t just him.

Raquel and Jon were doing it too. So was Terrance. Hell, my *whole* fucking team was doing it. No, that wasn’t quite true. The entire floor was. I was surrounded as far as the eye could see by undulating bodies of the people I once called friends. It almost looked like a dance, in a disturbing sort of way. They moved as if there was an invisible partner guiding them, their headphone cables twirling around their awkward movements like ribbons. Whatever it was, it filled me with so much terror I felt like my skin had been washed with ice. I wanted nothing more than to run, flying down the steps and bursting out the front door. But at the same time, something was stopping me. Something about their movements, how hideously graceful they were. 

But just as quickly as the dancing had started, it stopped. 

Then one by one they turned to look at me.

I tasted bile as I felt my chest heave, dragging in breaths as my body hit its limits on the amount of fear it could process. I staggered back, feeling my back hit the wall as the gazes of my coworkers drilled into me. For a moment, I thought I had reached the end of my life. I thought they were going to kill me. But they didn’t.

It started with Brian. He turned his whole body to face me. Then he raised his hands, his right one getting caught in the headphone cable as he lifted them to his mouth. His cold blue eyes met my terrified browns as he dove right in, reaching deep into his mouth. His right hand latched on to his bottom row of teeth, his left doing the same but they instead clamped down on his upper molars.

“B-BRIAN STOP!” I screamed, but I was too late.

He began to pull, cranking his arms downward as he yanked at his jaw. There was nothing I could do anymore, my feet rooted firmly to the floor as I watched Brian struggle. Then Terrance followed his lead. Then Raquel, then Jon, then Leonard. Before long everyone as far as the eye could see were people shoving their hands down their gullets, yanking their jaws fervently.

Then one by one, they ripped them off.

I’ll never forget the sounds they made. It was just like the sound velcro made when it was ripped off. Funnily enough, my brain went to the sound of me taking off my old light up shoes when I was a kid. But nothing was remotely funny about this. Brian’s was the first to go, letting out a triumphant gurgle as the lower half of his face came loose. He clutched his prize tightly in his right hand. Then the others went, and the sight I took in was one I’ll never be able to erase from my memory, no matter how hard I’ll try.

My coworkers looked at me, their jaws clutched tightly in their hands. Then one after another they fell, the meaty thwacking sound of bodies hitting the floor ringing out through the room. Then came the screams. The first one, surprisingly, came from me. I screamed for as long as I could. I screamed until my voice was hoarse. But it wasn’t just me. The wails echoed throughout the hall. Turns out it had happened to a department across from the elevators too.

The police found me there, not having moved from the spot, my gaze filled with the mangled corpses of my coworkers. There were questions, interviews, and sirens that echoed through the streets. I took some comfort in it though, I couldn’t go back to silence. After a few days and plenty of questions, they let me go. The news picked up the story at one point. 

Over half of the department, forty-six representatives, were dead.

No matter how many times I rack my brain and try to understand what happened there that day on the fourth floor, I can’t make sense of it. Nobody can. Eventually the story died down. Heck, I’d be surprised if any of you had heard about it.

But there’s one thing I want to tell you, something I didn’t tell the cops. After the others…after what happened I went to grab my phone from my desk, and as I got close, I heard something. Something coming from Brian’s headphones.

It sounded like singing.
