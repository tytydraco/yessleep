 (TW: Hoarding, mentions of insects, mentions of death) 

Despite my best searches I couldn’t find a better place to post this. There aren’t a whole lot of good Insomnia based subreddits, just the keyword filled with questions about medications I found from search engines, the movie from 2002 this morning when I joined, and some nightclub in Berlin, Germany I didn’t even bother looking that into. This subreddit titled “No Sleep” seemed like a last ditch effort until I saw the titles of everyone else struggling with this condition’s endeavors posted at all hours of the night in my quick scroll. So here goes nothing! 

I’m looking for a natural, low side effect way to help me fall asleep. 

I’m usually on your typical meds for this, something to slow my brain down and ambien. Unfortunately that’s not really an option right now. I am 430 miles away from home on a project where I’ll be sleeping in an RV with my crew of 3 for the next 2 weeks so sleep talking, hyper vivid dreams that wake me up in a panic, and the like are out of question. I’m not to sure what I’m going to have access too since the closest town of Byron, Wyoming has a whopping 600 people in it and even that’s 20 miles away. I really should have done this back in Cheyenne but hindsight is always 20/20 and desperate times call for desperate measures. It also doesn’t really help I’m on the type of job I swore I’d never take again. 

For the last 12 years I’d been doing extreme clean ups, and after I got certified crime scene clean up Im occasionally asked to do those too. Shockingly the latter is not why I’m saying that. I’m typing this outside of a two story, 6 room, 5 bathroom house with an office, big kitchen, dining room and living room stage 5 hoarder house with a basement we don’t even know if we can get into because the county couldn’t find the door to get down there to figure out if the smell is the house, a bust septic tank, or the smell of 100 acres of beef cattle pasture thawing for the spring being pushed by the wind up towards the house. 

It’s not even the boot laces I’m knotting tight around the ankles of my jeans to keep roaches and spiders from climbing up my legs and the hair bands on my wrists to keep my long sleeves tight to my arms for the same reason, or the layers of biohazard gear I’m putting on over all that to even enter the house between typing these paragraphs. 

It’s the people. I swear the people keep me up at night. Not the hoarders themselves, but their families. Especially in cases like these. How they all want to complain and whine about the state of the house, how much money we were costing them because the hoarder just couldn’t clean up, or worst of all how they just destroyed the family home. When I got into this for the money I would on occasion agree with them, but that all changed on the job I swore to myself I was making enough money to get out of this on. 

Lola was a 92 year old great depression era kid from Casper, who had passed away in  a level 4 hoarder home and wasn’t found for a couple weeks. That when I saw the spot she left this world from. Her full sized bed was visible from the door in its valley of towering books, magazines, and other literary materials. Her fetal position outline lay directly under a wall adorned with a full life. 

I saw a woman in black and white with a little Lola on her hip held there by wiry arms, face hard and skin taunt on against her sharp features. I saw a teen Lola in a wedding dress kissing a man in his twenties with an aged version of the previous woman next to a rugged man, flat smiles on their faces. The years marching Lola through 6 kids, two wars, births and weddings. 

And I saw Lola. 

I saw the fragile outline of a woman the word forgot encased by the life she lead, the only comforts she had left, flies diving and pitching through the unbreathable air haphazardly, as their larvae danced bellow all seemingly to the same unheard melody of decay and impermanence. We moved the warped bed frame to a cacophony of screams then blistering swears, releasing a torrent of cockroaches up the wall across the things she held dearest. 

All I could feel was the rage of these swarming things being the only living things there for her when she left this place. 

All I could see were those creatures parade of desperation when I offered one of her children these photos and he asked me if I found any jewelry or money. 

All I could do was serve 6 months of court order Anger Management for breaking his nose. 

When I came back to work I saw things differently, I saw the still living hoarders in a new light. Now every time I walk into houses, like this one, where we were removing an entire history from a piece of land I did not feel disgust in the filth. I felt the magnitude of history around me, like I was about to burn someone’s library of Alexandria to the ground. So in most cases I kept little souvenirs, for me it was the keys to locks about to vanish, the symbolism of things I’d never know but was the last person to hold onto the idea of. The ornate keys of past centuries, those and skeleton keys, were the ones I loved most. 

Following my boss Dave’s steps through the narrow path into the house, palm to his upper back to steady him, I took in the breadth of the job while typing this. Interestingly enough this path lead to a spot on the wall where a particularly buff version of the crucified Christ in brass hung. This path lead to a t-joint moving towards the kitchen on its right, then to a back hallway on its left proudly sporting its own t-joint giving a clear path to the stairs. 

Maybe we were both just jaded or numb to the mess. Maybe it was the fact I hadn’t slept in a solid 52 hours but we were having an oddly easy time until we had to go up those stairs. The ascending diagonal of 7, if you counted the broken one, crosses. The only clear side of the stairs was right next to them. Each one differed from the other and had some ornate design. As soon as we got up those stairs the whole house felt colder, meaning we had some sort of attic with a hole clear through the roof they didn’t mention. We could only get to 3 of the upper rooms due to the lack of a path to door and the waist high refuse backed into the hall corner adorned with that door and above it yet another crucified Christ but this one was made of clothes pins.

I looked to Dave, Dave looked to me. We both smiled about it, but neither of us had the balls to laugh about cute lil clothes pin Jesus in fear of the house’s condition being mixed with bad karma or blasphemy depending on what side of the street you stand on. He spun on his heels knife handing at the door to his right before opening it. This one looked to be some sort of library with no clear organization plan with a wealth of papers filling the middle. The next one was more of office with the same issue but bore brilliant massive paintings of scripture scenes on the walls. They had to have costed hundreds of dollars each, easy. 

The last door was the master bedroom. Which starling both of us was spotless, it had that funky smell that older men had but it didn’t reek like the rest of the house. The ancient vacuum in the corner gave off the odor of mothballs, the bathroom smelt like antiseptic and the menthol of joint cream even through my mask. Cleanliness is next to godliness, i suppose.

 I lead Dave back down the stairs and hooked left into the hall leading to the last two bedrooms. That’s when it happend. That’s why I’m here. I swore I heard in something just louder than a whisper. 

*As a dog returns to its vomit*

I looked at Dave who made a grand gesture of ushering me foreward giving his classic line of ‘as soon as you suit up and got your gloves on you’re nose is gonna itch and you’re gonna get a shit pain in your gut’ to me to explain his urgency to get this over with. 

Meaning I’m at the point of being so tired I’m starting to have auditory hallucinations. If any of my fellow ‘no sleepers’ have any ideas please let me know them. I’d prefer not to resort to getting black out drunk to get some sleep but I’m getting desperate enough to wake up somewhere I didn’t fall asleep. 

As we walked into the room on the right there wasn’t really much worth mentioning besides a Bon Jovi “Living on Prayer” vinyl sleeve some teen boy in the 80s has likely convinced his parents was gospel music, judging by the Journey “Don’t stop Believing” one right next to it pinned above the full bed, trash spilling from there to the floor and blocking the way to the Jack and Jill bathroom in the back left corner of the room.

Well Jack and Jack. Dave said they were brothers. Identical Twins who sounded exactly alike on the phone actually. He’d spent a solid 12 minutes complaining about that when he agreed to come take a look. My heckles raised when we entered the other room. It was trashed, and floor was doing that sort of spongy thing old wood did that told me the smell was definitely septic. If that wasn’t bad enough it hit me again something like

*as does a man repeat his folly*

Seeing as I’m finally done with the project plan Dave thinks I’ve totally been doing for my crew in the last 30 minutes, thank you all in advanced for your time reading this and any advice or ideas you have. They’re really appreciated in my current situation. Hope some of you other no sleepers can get some shut eye tonight.
