At first, I thought it was just a trick of the mind, a momentary illusion caused by fatigue or stress. However, the events that followed made it clear that something was happening.  
  
I was sitting in the classroom when everything changed. It was a math class on a boring Monday, I know. The lights started flickering, as if they wanted to fail, and then, they went out for a second. Just a second, and the teacher, the students, everyone seemed to have their faces swapped. Not swapped with each other, they were people I had never seen before in my life. I blinked, trying to adjust to the new reality, but the confusion only grew. I felt dizzy and stood up impulsively. The teacher, now with a strange and unfamiliar face, looked at me with a concerned expression, 'Are you okay, Ryan?' I was panting, 'Ah, yes, Mr... Grimshall.' It was still strange to associate the name with the unfamiliar face. I was feeling really bad about this; it was almost like a panic attack. 'You don't look good at all. Why don't you get some fresh air outside?' I took a step but stumbled; he held me, 'Okay, maybe it's better for you to go home. I'll call your parents, sit in the courtyard to get some air and don't exert yourself.'  
  
I was apprehensive; they called my dad to pick me up, and I just wanted to find him and tell him everything that was happening.  
  
'Ryan, is everything okay, son?' - His familiar voice echoed.  
  
I raised my head, a bit more confident, only to collapse again, looking at a face that wasn't my dad's. I started to sweat, and tears filled my eyes. I thought about running or not going with this stranger, but the car was really my dad's. I... was I going crazy? At home, as you might imagine, my mother was unrecognizable too. I ran to my room and locked myself in, saying I felt sick and that the milk I drank in the morning might be spoiled. Believe me when I say I spent hours rummaging through photo albums, watching videos, looking for some explanation for this bizarre turn of events. All evidence indicated that these were my parents, but something seemed off.  
  
I fell asleep in this feverish delirium and woke up in the middle of the night with my stomach growling. I opened the door slowly, facing the luminous and sonorous void in the hallway, a large tomb where even a slightly louder breath would echo like thunder. I walked cautiously to the kitchen, praying that the stairs wouldn't creak. I was about to turn left into the living room, heading to the kitchen when I stopped. There was a beam of light, a rectangular, long, and thin strip that extended from the kitchen to the other end of the living room.  
  
I looked carefully, keeping half of my face hidden behind the wall. It was the light from the refrigerator. But not only that, I wished it were. My 'mother' was there, standing, messing with something I couldn't see. And she kept making a noise, a strange and guttural hiss, a wet sound that disgusted just to hear. When she finally stepped back a bit, I could see inside the refrigerator; it was full of meat, large clusters of raw meat in thick bags, and she was... eating? Eating raw meat? What the hell is this? For a moment, her face twisted in a strange way, as if it were a mask. Two thin, spiky limbs came out of her mouth and grabbed the meat. She stopped. Became totally still for a moment, and then started turning in my direction.  
  
I hid and prayed to all the gods that I could make it back to my room in silence. I heard her footsteps coming behind me, climbed the stairs, and gently closed the door of my room, more quietly than she did. I had turned to the wall, and all I could do was listen to her steps behind me, her skin touching the cold floor. She stopped by the side of the bed, bent over me, and seemed to sniff. I had never made such an effort in my life not to move, but I managed to stay still. She stood up, and I could hear the sound of the door, but I knew, I knew she was there, standing in the corner of the room, waiting for me to move. Amidst this panic, after I don't know how long, I fell asleep. I woke up with my alarm clock, put on my uniform quickly, all I wanted was to get out of that house. However, my mother opened the door, and I froze a bit having a flashback from the previous night.  
  
'Where do you think you're going, young man? You're sick; need to rest.'  
  
'No, mom, it's okay, seriously, I'm fine.'  
  
'I talked to the school principal, and you're going to spend the week at home.' She sat on the bed beside me. 'Look at you, sweating.' She wiped my forehead. 'If it continues like this, we'll have to go to the doctor.'  
  
'I'm fine, mom... let me go to school, please.'  
  
'I've never seen you so eager to go to class. Is it some girl?' She laughed. 'Here's the deal: the grass is high, and your father seems too busy with his football to do it. If you can mow the lawn, I think it might mean you've improved, okay?' She gave me a kiss on the forehead and left.  
  
That really confused me. Indeed, I felt like it was my mom saying that. The fear disappeared, and I began to consider the possibility that yesterday was just a hallucination due to fever. I went down to the backyard and started mowing the grass; it took about 40 minutes to finish. In the end, I was feeling lighter; it really helped to distract me. I would have spent the afternoon just fine, even giving up the idea of going to school, if it weren't for one detail: I noticed, in a corner, a patch of softer soil, as if it had been recently disturbed. I approached, looked around, not seeing anyone, and bent down to dig. However, what I found was the last nail in the coffin of my sanity:  
  
A picture of my family. Me, my dad, and my mom. My real mom and dad, as I remembered them, not these from now. Although the frame was intact, the glass covering it had been broken, and I could see some stains of... blood? I heard my dad's car arriving; I hid the picture and buried it, going back to my room before he came into the house. I'm alternating between pretending to be asleep and feeling sick, but I don't know if it worked. As I type this, I can hear my 'mom' coming up the stairs; she's humming, and now her voice sounds more distorted, saying 'Come, Ryan, it's time to take a walk with your parents.'
