Okay, I know that the title sounds absolutely insane, but honestly, that’s part of the problem.

Everyone whom I tried to tell about this either thinks I’m doing random humor, pranking them, or, what’s worse, that I completely lost my mind. But let me assure you, this is true, and to me, it’s not a laughing matter. I lost my sleep, I barely go outside anymore, and I fear for my life every day, which is part of the reason why I’ve decided to write it all down. At least if I disappear, the internet will have this text. Maybe then someone will believe me.

It started about two months ago. That evening, my best bud Chris and I had a tad too many drinks while trying to get acquainted with girls at the local bar. Actually, we probably drank more after failing to meet anyone, but that’s beside the point.

After we got out of the bar, we decided to go home through a nice park neighboring our street. The effect of rejections and booze combined made us very philosophical, so we took our time, enjoying the company of the tall poplar trees around us.

At some point, Chris either had to call somebody or go in the bushes, so I was left for a minute. I was in a pretty good mood despite everything and wanted to “breathe in” the beauty of the surrounding world, so I started slowly looking around, focusing on each tree. God, I wish I had just gone home right then.

Either way, while enjoying the nature, I saw something odd in the distance. Something that shouldn’t have been there. It was a tall, pale shape that almost blended with the night sky in the moonlight. I thought it was a lantern at first, but it wasn’t turned on and was placed oddly, almost hidden between the poplar’s crowns. I stepped closer, the curious idiot I was, and saw that the shape wasn’t resembling a lantern at all. In fact, it looked like a head with a tremendously large neck and an elongated nose.

Suddenly, I had a feeling of being watched. I couldn’t see the eyes of that thing, but I could’ve sworn it was looking right at me. I felt like a sitting duck on that sidewalk, and my peaceful mood turned to panic. The moment I stepped back, something in that shape began moving. Probably its jaw chewing on something, but back then, I couldn’t tell.

I simply ducked behind the nearby bench and sat there until I heard Chris’s voice calling out to me. When he came back, the animal was gone. We laughed it off and I promised to myself to never drink so much in a single night. Sadly, it didn’t help.

I saw it once again two days later, in the same exact spot, only this time it was during daylight, and I managed to make out its features.

We were walking back home from college that day, I think it was me and three of my classmates. They decided to stop for an ice-cream since the weather was still quite hot despite it already being autumn, and I sat on one of the benches with my phone in hand. That’s when I felt the same exact sensation. Somebody was staring at me, looking right into my soul.

I turned around and saw it in the distance. It was pretty far away, but given its height of about 18 feet, I recognized it very quickly. I could finally see that it was a giraffe, only its head and horns larger than normal. Its jaw also was opened in a strange position, like its lower half was just aimlessly hanging there. The giraffe looked skinny and pale. I’d think it was very sick if I saw it in a documentary, but I didn’t think about that back then.

What I thought about was the fact that I saw a goddamn giraffe staring at me from between the trees, and I was completely sober! I called my friends and told them what I saw, catching several confused looks. We had a zoo nearby, so I figured it wasn’t impossible for one of their animals to escape. Maybe it was hurt and needed help, hiding in the trees because they resembled its habitat.

But when we came back, the giraffe was gone, and my friends mistook it for a prank. I tried convincing them that I actually saw it and hated myself for not taking a picture. This interaction quickly became weird as my classmates didn’t know how to react at all, so I decided to change the topic.

After all, if there was actually a whole adult giraffe on the loose, it was hard to believe it’d be able to go unnoticed for much longer. Somebody would most likely report it, and it’d be brought back to the zoo. Sure enough, nothing like this was reported, and no animals seemed to escape recently (I checked to make sure, even visited our local zoo and talked to one of the keepers).

But it didn’t stop the giraffe, or whatever it actually was, from appearing again. In fact, it started happening more frequently. I could’ve sworn I started seeing it at least once a day, its giant neck towering above fences or hiding behind treelines. It usually happened after sunset, so I was never sure what exactly I saw, even when I came to accept the fact that this thing was actually there. And before you ask, yes, I did try to take a photo. Of course, there was no trace of a giraffe on the picture despite the camera being pointed right at it. At that point, I can’t say I was shocked.

It became much worse three weeks ago, when I saw it during a lecture in college. I was already on edge and found it hard to concentrate. It wasn’t easy living with the knowledge that somewhere you were watched by a giant giraffe, yet even speaking it out loud made you sound like a lunatic. So I sat there nearly shaking, unsure whether to look into the windows or ignore them so I wouldn’t be scared by what I saw there.

Unfortunately, I ended up looking. As soon as I turned my head, I saw the giraffe glaring at me from behind the nearby building, its neck craned in an unnatural angle and its jaw hanging even lower than before. It was much closer this time, so I managed to make up the worst part: its eyes. They were pale, murky, and unblinking, like they belonged to an old corpse and were about to fall out of their sockets. Yet, I still could feel they were watching, and this time, it was just too much to bear.

I screamed like a baby and bolted out of the classroom, scaring half of my class and making the other half laugh like crazy. What’s worse, in this fit of panic I couldn’t keep myself from yelling “giraffe” as I ran into the corridor, which made coming up with an excuse much harder. Of course there was no giraffe on the property, why would there be one? Trying to describe what I saw to some of my friends and my parents just reinforced the idea that I suddenly went insane.

The college suggested I take some time off, blaming my weird behavior on stress and insomnia. Parents were very concerned and even sent me to a psychiatrist. However, before we could even run any tests, it happened again. And after its next visit, I wasn’t able to sleep in my bedroom anymore.

I didn’t sleep very well that night, kept tossing and turning in my bed. Then, I heard a knock. I quickly realized it wasn’t coming from the door to my room, which left only one possible option: the window. It wouldn’t be so odd if I didn’t sleep on the second floor of our suburban house and there was no way somebody was getting here without setting up a ladder and waking up everybody in the process.

The knocking continued. I froze under my sheet, unable to move or make a sound. I wasn’t sure it was the giraffe, but I could feel it somehow. Its knocks became more insistent, and I finally decided to call my parents. However, I was too scared to scream, so I opted to quietly tiptoe to their room and lead them back here for proof.

I almost opened the door when the window suddenly opened, letting gusts of cold wind into the room. Despite my best judgment, I turned around and screamed in terror once again. The giraffe’s pale, chewing head was peeking at me from the window frame with mere feet between us.

I dashed into my parents’ room, tears rolling down my eyes. I like to think I didn’t wet myself at that point, but that’s probably a lie. This time, they played along and ran into my bedroom with my dad carrying his six-shooter. They didn’t find anything there or on the street below, and the window turned out to be closed.

I couldn’t sleep at all that night and had to lie down in the hallway when the tiredness finally overtook me. I just couldn’t make myself sleep near a window, filled with fear that the giraffe would stick its head through it and tear me apart with its jaws. Overall, it was a terrible week, and my fear of that thing grew so much I had to move to our house’s basement. Centipedes and lizards aren’t very pleasant company, but at least nothing taller than 10 feet can fit down here. At least I’m trying to hope so, despite everything.

You know what the worst thing is? Spending my whole days in the basement away from my friends and college gave me time to think, and recently I started to see some connections that just weren’t there before. Like when you suddenly remember a dream after it’s been years since you saw it. And maybe I know why it’s been happening to me, at least I think I might know.

My uncle used to be a traveler, fascinated by Africa and the indigenous tribes living there. There were times when he’d be satisfied with regular tourist routes, but at some point, he decided to venture farther into Africa’s plains and explore areas few eyes could ever see. It was a hobby which turned into a profession that defined my uncle’s entire life. Eventually it also took his life, as he died in an accident during one of the trips several months ago.

The point is, sometimes he’d visit and tell tales about his travels. Sometimes, he’d also bring us souvenirs to prove he wasn’t just making shit up. I was never really interested in either of those things. When he’d start rambling about his encounters with wild animals, local tribes, or, I kid you not, spirits, I never listened. I didn’t believe a single word, and I doubt my parents did either. Either way, exploring Africa made my uncle happy, so we just sort of went along with it.

I’m not that concerned about the stories, and I wouldn’t be able to remember any of that gibberish even if I tried. What I was thinking about were the “souvenirs.” Sometimes they’d just be regular things you could buy in any store, or mundane objects like rocks he claimed to have found in exciting, faraway places. But if he only brought those, we’d know his foray was in vain. Because other times, he’d find something far more mysterious.

Like figurines, charms, or talismans depicting African animals, people, or some strange creatures I’ve never seen before or after that. I never thought much about them, but these things looked ancient. We usually kept them in a closet along with other stuff we might’ve needed at some point but probably wouldn’t. A talisman went in and never came out, secluded in the dark depths of our home.

Well, at least all of them were until a little more than a year ago, when one of my friends and I came home drunk and went on a bit of a bender while my parents were at work. I swear I don’t remember what exactly happened that day or what I was doing in my parents’ closet, but what I do remember is a couple of the talismans lying on the floor, clearly damaged by my meek hiding attempts. Once again, I never thought much about that incident until now. Could it be that those events and me being stalked by this monster are somehow connected? Honestly, right now I’ll believe anything.

I’ve read that some of the Ethiopian tribes used to consider giraffes their spirit animals, their tall stature and ability to survive in the hot plains being symbols of a strong will and longevity. But it’s been a year between the accident and the moment when I first saw the giraffe, or whatever that thing even is. Why would it wait for so long? Or could it be that it was there this whole time, just distant enough for me to not notice?

Anyway, I doubt this information will help me in any way. Those talismans are long gone, and without my uncle, there’s nobody to tell me anything about them. I asked my parents when they visited me, but they just looked at me with a gaze you’d give a patient from an insane asylum. I’m very tired. I just hope this basement can keep me safe, although, like I said, it’s getting more difficult to feel comfortable even here. My dreams have been getting worse lately.

In them, I hear the sounds of hooves and see tall, lanky figures looming above me like predators stalking their prey. But yesterday, I saw the worst nightmare yet: I felt like I was lying in my bed, and the giraffe somehow found its way into the house above. I thought I was safe, but then I saw it contorting into an unnatural shape, its bones producing a deafening crack each time it violently thugged itself forward. It became unrecognizable but somehow managed to squeeze into the corridor leading to my basement room. Then it reared its pale, broken head and slammed it against my door.

That’s when I screamed, and I haven’t been able to go back to sleep ever since. I wish I could say that it was just a dream and I was safe, but there’s something deep inside of me telling me that it wasn’t. Some deep, primordial horror, probably more ancient than my uncle’s talismans and even the tribes that produced them. It’s growing stronger by the day, and I’m not sure how long I’ve got until it consumes me whole. I’m praying that it’s just a mental illness, but I can’t help but feel like my prayers are falling on deaf ears.

Besides, after that dream, I woke up with the door to my room ajar despite locking it in the evening.
