When my parents kicked me out of home at 18, I’d already been promoted to store manager at our local 7-11. The money wasn’t great, but I was frugal and had saved enough to rent a room in a shitty red-brick apartment block.


Our facilities were shared—a kitchen, two laundry machines, and four toilets. There were a lot of awkward encounters, and we all knew each other by name.


Behind the building we had a general waste area with two skip bins, locked behind a shutter door that we opened with a fob. I was taking out my trash one night, key fob ready, but the shutter door was open. The building was old, and things were always breaking, so I thought nothing of it.


I was about to open the skip bin lid when I noticed a light shining from inside. Someone was in there, shuffling around in the rubbish. I could hear them chewing and eating. Times were hard, and it wasn’t uncommon to find people scavenging the bins for discarded food.


I quietly left my trash bag on the ground in the garbage area and walked away. It must be humiliating enough to dig through rubbish, and I didn’t want to make them feel embarrassed. We're all just trying to get by.


As I was heading back inside, one of my neighbors—a middle-aged woman named Miriam—was looking around outside and calling out, “Bella!”


Bella was the name of her small Pomeranian. The dog was well-behaved and very friendly, always walking up to anyone and rolling on its belly for pats.


I approached cautiously, “Excuse me—do you need any help?”


“I’m fine, thanks,” she replied. Then, as if realizing her tone might have sounded too harsh, she added, “Dave—you remember my ex-husband Dave? He stopped by to collect his clothes, but the idiot left the door open and now Bella got out.”


I did remember Dave. The apartment walls were thin, and I’d twice thought about calling the cops when the shouting matches got out of hand.


“I’m sorry to hear. Maybe once it’s light out, she’ll know her surroundings better and come home. I’ll keep an eye out.”


“Thanks, Curtis.”


I trudged up the stairs to my unit, my mind heavy with the day’s disquiet. Seeking to dull the creeping anxiety, I lit a joint—an attempt at calm that felt woefully inadequate. As I exhaled slowly, the persistent clamor from the skip bins reminded me how I could very easily have been in the same situation myself.


The next night, I stayed late to cover a coworker’s shift and stumbled home exhausted. Miriam was chatting with one of the older ladies, Helena, as they waited for the laundry cycles to finish. Their noses were scrunched up, and they seemed to be looking around for something.


“What's up? Is there a gas leak?” I asked.


Helena pointed to a vent near the ceiling. “We think something died in there. Maybe a rat.”


I stepped closer; the stench was overwhelming. “God—that’s awful.”


“I’ve already logged it with maintenance, not that they’ll show up anytime soon.”


Miriam sighed. “I’m still waiting on them to get back to me about the skip bin door.”


I wanted to ask Miriam if she’d found Bella, but it was past 10:00 PM, and I knew I'd get caught in a long-winded chat. So, I excused myself.


After eating a quick microwave dinner, I noticed some expired fruit in the back fridge. I didn’t want it to rot and stink up my apartment, so I took it directly to the skip bins out back. As Miriam had mentioned, the shutter doors were still stuck open. And there was the smell—thick wafts of something like off meat. Maybe that’s why I paid more attention. Someone had unscrewed the bolts at the top of the shutter door so it would hit them and not close.


Making a mental note to follow up on that, I opened the skip bin to throw out my trash. Immediately, the smell hit me. It was so bad my eyes stung and watered. I looked inside. Bones. Lots of them—vertebrae, a ribcage, a small skull with sharp canines and fur still on the muzzle. Bits of rotting flesh and hair clung to them. I reeled back, wanting to throw up. What on earth had happened to that poor thing? It was hard to make out what animal it was, but it looked like a small house pet of some sort.


I couldn’t leave it like this. I went to call management, but then something silver and shiny caught my eye—a dog collar with a name engraved.


"Bella! Here girl!" Miriam shouted from the front door.


My thumb hesitated over the call button. Maybe it was for the best that Bella wasn’t found—at least then, Miriam could hold on to the hope that Bella had escaped to somewhere better rather than remain in a place where everything was rotting away.
