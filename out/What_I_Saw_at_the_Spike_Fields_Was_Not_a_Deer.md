It had become a recent rite of passage for kids my age to visit the Spike Field before graduating from high school. “Visit” might be a generous way to put it—“break in” would be the correct term. Of course, that's never stopped anyone before. 

Development on the Waste Isolation Pilot Plan started nearly 40 years ago, as far as I understood. A nuclear warning designed to last a millennium. The government needed a safe place to dispose of nuclear waste, so they assembled a think tank to figure out the where and how. It needed to stand as a warning of danger, long after any language or symbol has any meaning. It's a sobering thought that one day our language would become lost and any pictures or signs we post might become meaningless, worse so that even after that, the waste of our civilization will still exist, and continue to be dangerous. The goal was to create a monument whose message couldn't be misunderstood: danger. Of course, Death Valley was chosen as the dump site, the most desolate and isolated place on earth. How exactly production started and ended we had never looked into—it didn’t matter to me or my friends.

At the end of the day, it was just a place we weren’t supposed to go. Which, of course, only served to act as a challenge to the graduating class of local high schools. There wasn’t any surveillance or cops guarding the place, so there really wasn’t as much risk as we’d like to pretend. In retrospect, the only thing you really had to lose by going was some gas money. Still, none of that dulled its reputation at my high school. If you went and made it to the bottom of the tunnel, you were a man.

So imagine my dismay when I found out my friends had gone without me.

It was late May, just a couple of weeks before graduation, when I made the rare and stupid decision to go on a date. The third date of my entire high school career—and it just happened to be the same day my idiot friends decided to make the drive out. I didn’t find out until the next day.

I was, of course, livid. I’d been planning to go since my freshman year. To add salt to the wound, I'd never even see the girl again. 

I begged them for details, but didn’t get much. As much as I loved my friends, they weren’t great storytellers. All I could get out of them was, “It was cool,” and “They were huge.”

After some more grilling, they gave me the general location of the field and what road they took to get there. I decided to go out there that same day— either out of fear of being left out, or of spite. I don’t think they really cared either way.

I hadn’t thought it through before I left. I had a half-empty bottle of warm water in the cupholder and a bag of chips in the back seat. It didn't occur to me until halfway through the drive that the only thing I’d eaten that day was a Big Mac and a Diet Coke. 

I ended up pulling off at the entrance to a small town and into the lot of an even smaller gas station. A distorted chime crackled through the intercom as I stepped inside, barely clinging to the ceiling.

I grabbed a questionable-looking sandwich and a Gatorade—my meal for the day—and headed to the register. I remember the woman behind the counter eyeing me suspiciously as she rang up my stuff, her gaze flicking up and down my clothes. Back then, I didn’t really give off “outdoorsy” vibes, but I hadn’t realized just how out of place I looked. Maybe it was the New Balances or the DOOM graphic tee. But it was pretty obvious I’d never set foot in the national park before—or maybe not even outside at all. 

The rest of the ride was uneventful. The desert is beautiful, but gets old after maybe 20 minutes or so. The novelty wears off quickly; it all just blurs into one great stretch of land. I drive through it all the time on roadtrips, passing from one state into the next. Ever since I was little, it's always fascinated me, though I could never wait to get to the next town or change of terrain. I'd find myself looking out the window- away from whatever movie we had on in the back seat, into the vast expanse of land rolling by. You forget just how much there actually is out there until it's all passing by. Cities are big, the suburbs seem to go on forever,  it's easy to think there's not a place on earth that's gone untouched by humans. But once you're confronted with miles upon miles of bush, rock, and dirt, you sober up quick. I could list off all the reasons I reckon the desert unsettles me so much, but the more I try to answer, the more questions I get. At the end of the day, all I'm left with is that morbid fascination that I have felt since I was little.

An hour or so had passed and my car's engine had begun to start whining from the heat, It didn't bother me too much though. For about a year, I had been leaking power steering fluid and as a result, every time I pressed the accelerator or turned the wheel, it would let out an awful whirring noise, like a wind-up toy or a dying cat. I used to think the reason people would turn around when I drove down the street was because of how handsome I was, when really, they were wondering what was making that awful sound. I'm not sure what was going on underneath the hood resulting in its howl, but it didn't matter to me as long as it drove. Lucky for me, the saying was true. Civics never die; they'll be around far longer than humans will and beyond. Didn't matter turning into 3rd was a full upper body workout, as long as I got from A to B. 

I'm not sure when the radio stopped working. Static had begun to flow out of the speakers, no matter what station I tuned it to. I wasn't sure how far out I was, but if the endless sea earth wasn't anything to go by, my last means of any connection to civilization being rendered useless was. That didn't matter though, I enjoyed the white noise and the time the ride gave me to think.

The more time went on, the more isolated I felt. Mile after mile, what little animals I'd spot on the side of the road, like lizards and mice diminished. I'd even stop spying the buzzards flying overhead. I don't know how anything would live out here in the first place, even so, it was concerning just how little life I saw. Never before had I felt so alone, so isolated. So small. Eventually, the barbed wire fences occasionally lining the road began to disappear. I had always wondered who set those up and how many years ago. The only thing left to tell me anyone was here at all was the paved road, somehow not crumbled and cracked from the sun like he rest of the terrain around me.

I tapped my fingers impatiently on the steering wheel, just to remind myself I was still there. Just then, slowly, a thin black shape stabbed up from the earth in the distance. Then two, then another, and more after that. There must've been hundreds from what I could tell, standing defiantly toward the heavens. They were not uniform. Some were tall and twisted, others short and proud. Too erratic to be art, too intentional for it to be random. Even from this distance, I could tell just how massive they were, standing imposingly over the otherwise barren and empty topography.

Finally, I had made it to the Spike Field.
