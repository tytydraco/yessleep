*Very crass commentary on suicide and suicide description. Please read at own risk and be safe my friends*




Look, I was really depressed. Medication wasn’t working, I felt full of cement.
At 28, I hung myself in my closet. 
It wasn’t stoic or anything remotely close to tragic, it was gross as I convulsed against the belt. Drooling and losing my hearing as blood is restricted from entering my skull. 
After maybe 5-7 agonizing minutes, I felt my body give into the weightless feeling of black dots, invading my vision.  

**
It was like I woke up from falling, I’m in a small cement room. It smells musty and of something organic. After blinking several times, I finally take a real look around. It’s cracking in all spots, ceiling, floor, every crevice has a spider web stemming from its surface. There’s a black, ominous camera in the back right corner, a red light beaming as it stares me down.  

“Hello?” My voice sounds meek.  

As suspected, no response.  
After a few moments of staring at the camera, almost hypnotized, a door appears. Not a subtle appearance but it literally *materializes*. In awe, I watch as the smooth, copper handle turns, forgetting the horror that someone is opening it.  

She, *it*, was large for the room, not in weight, but overall size. Soft, delicate fingers attached to smooth arms, that run into a long, white gown. Its size was made up in its wings. Giant gray/white feathers span out from its back and shoulders. The worst part was the hundreds of eyes that covered the wings, never breaking contact with my own two.  
Its face was not one at all, but wrapped in what looked like white silk, to form the idea of a head. There were red wet lines, like tears, where I assume eyes would be. 

After taking in the full appearance of it, I felt the panic rising with every wordless second, the moist sound of eyes blinking.   
“They would like to see you now.” Wind chimes. That’s the best way to describe its voice, soft wind brushing hollow metal. No specific gender to identify.
“W..who?” I find one word in my brain to respond in the presence of surveillance itself. Blink.  
“Why God, ofcourse!”  

I’m being led down the hallway, more like a cave dug into the side of a mountain, feelings of claustrophobia creeping up. Dirt follows the feathers being brushed by the being, leading me to “God.”  
I was never a religious person, which made this almost morbidly interesting. I had doubted the belief all my life, was I about to witness a floating man who shoots bolts or whatever? I almost wish that was the conclusion. 

After what feels like miles trudging through endless dirt and pebbles, we reach an almost identical door to my concrete bunker I woke up in. I stare as it turns to me, I don’t know where to look while it speaks,  
“They do not like many questions. They ask the questions. You may go back or they may want you to stay.” It felt solemn. Absolute.  
I nod.  
It pushes the door open to another concrete room, but this one has a lone desk and wooden chair in it. An old computer monitor sits atop, brightly illuminating the dim corners of the space. I feel the winged creature gently press its fingers on the center of my back, urging me forward. My legs shakily obey the command. 

The computer hums as I finally reach the rickety seat, slowly lowering myself down. I stare at the static on the screen. I feel my stomach trying to escape through my throat.  
Words begin to type themselves out on the screen.  
‘DID YOU KILL ANOTHER?’  
I blurted out my answer, “Ofcourse not, I’ve never hurt another person!”  
It sits for a moment, if it wasn’t a computer, I’d assume in thought.  
‘WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOTHER?’  
My skull felt like it might implode. My mother was the salt of the earth, an absolute saint of a human. She never made me feel hurt. I’d NEVER hurt her!  
“N…no! I’d never hur…”  
It cut me off with loud keys,  
‘SHE FOUND YOUR BODY.’  
Somehow that short sentence felt like it could kill me. The key to my apartment she had. It’s Saturday. We’re supposed to have brunch. Instead she found my pathetic exit in my own closet. My gentle mother having to face the corpse of her child.  

The screen switched to black. Beginning with a fuzzy screen, it begins to come into focus to reveal a messy room. My messy room. Tears begin to fall before I can stop them.  
“Please… don’t.” It’s barely a whisper, a plea to motherboards and wires.  
There she is. Standing in front of the open closet door. Her body frozen. Like a reality TV show, it switches to a front view.  
She’s pulling my body down as if she was handling a newborn, supporting my blue faced head. Scrunched face, biting her bottom lip, she lowers us both to the ground. She strokes my hair, her fingers shaking. Without warning, the wail begins. A sound so devastating that it made my heart want to burst. I watched her call 911, knowing it was useless. Never letting go of her baby girl.  
I am buzzing, a million flies inside my ears, screaming.  
‘DID SHE DESERVE THIS?’  
My head is shaking back and forth violently,  
“No. I… I don’t know what to do… I… I just hurt so bad. Please, you have to understand…” in between sobs was the best I could do. My own pity party.   
‘BURIED ALIVE.’  
My breathing accelerates,  
“What does that mean?” Deep down, I think I knew.  
‘A LIFE, FOR A LIFE. EYE FOR AN EYE. YOUR MOTHER’S WORST NIGHTMARE WAS YOUR DEATH. SELF CAUSED.  
BURIED ALIVE. YOU WILL NOT DIE, JUST SUFFOCATE. NEVER TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AGAIN.’
Before I can respond, God’s orders became a quick project.  
I have a flashlight. A phone with low battery. My own suffocating throat gags as I try to inhale.  
God’s judgement has been executed.  
25ft under in a box.

I will not die. I can’t fill my lungs. I’m so sorry, momma. *You didn’t deserve this.*
