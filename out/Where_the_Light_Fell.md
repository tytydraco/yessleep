I’d rather not be on duty on my day off. But the old, worn-down countryside property at the edge of town got bumped up on the demolition list sooner than I expected. I needed to check it for squatters so the crew can have a safe and boring demolition.

The first thing that struck me was how far the house sat from the road. I suppose its original inhabitants valued their privacy. From a distance, the place looked fairly unremarkable. But up close, the details stood out. 

Vines crept along its walls, breaking through patches of what used to be white paint. Rusty pipes hung loose, ready to drop at the slightest touch, and a welcome mat lay half-eaten by vermin.

As I stepped over the threshold, something shifted. The sparrows outside went silent, and the spring warmth faded into a damp, tired coolness. I closed the door behind me, and it creaked in an odd, nearly deliberate sort of way. Almost as if it were trying to say something I couldn’t quite understand. 

I had expected an old house like this to smell of moss or decay. Instead, the air carried the faintest hint of something sweet and floral. Jasmines, of all things. They don’t grow here, certainly not in an abandoned house with no one to water them. Yet the scent lingered, soft and persistent, becoming clearer as my senses adjusted to the dim interior.

Another strange thing I noticed was how dim the interior felt, despite sunlight streaming through the windows. The light never fell randomly. It touched only certain spots, as if choosing them with intention.
A hairbrush lying on the floor.
A book resting on the coffee table.
A pair of oven mittens hanging from the kitchen wall.
An unopened Christmas present beneath a dried-out tree.
A small toy soldier on the dusty boards.
The sunlight avoided emptiness and settled only on objects that seemed meaningful, as if the house were intentionally trying to show them to me.
The toy soldier was the strangest of them all. It sat on the dusty floor, yet it was spotless. Too clean, as if it had been played with often. I bent down for a closer look. Not a single speck of dust clung to it. This house was supposed to have been abandoned for at least half a decade.

I wasn’t sure what to make of the strange shadows that lingered throughout the house either. I noticed them only in the corners of my vision. They seemed too solid to be mere shadows, yet too formless to be anything more. Sometimes, if I tried to focus on them from the edge of my sight, they grew darker, almost pulsing with a muted glow. But the moment I turned my head toward them, they vanished.
As I continued inspecting the ground floor, I kept hearing the delicate sound of pages turning. The faintest flip, then silence. I paused each time, certain my ears weren’t deceiving me. But whenever I followed the sound, there were no books. Nothing at all that could have made it.

I climbed the old wooden stairs to inspect the upper floor. With each step, the boards creaked in a way that felt strangely intentional. The sounds weren’t the usual complaints of old timber. Their rhythm shifted, their volume rose and fell, almost as though the creaks were trying to form words trapped inside the wood.
“James, come down for dinner,” one step seemed to murmur.
“Yes, Mom,” whispered the next.

Halfway up, the wind outside grew more noticeable. But even that didn’t sound quite right. Beneath the usual hush of air through broken shutters, I could hear a soft melody akin to a woman humming. When I paused to listen closely, the tune became unmistakable.
The Skye Boat Song.
“Carry the lad that’s born to be king…over the sea to Skye.”My mother used to sing that to me when I was a child.

Upstairs, the air shifted. The faint smell of jasmine had almost vanished. It was colder here, with stillness in a way that felt deliberate. Sunlight from a single window reached only one place: the door handle at the end of the hallway.
The shadows lingered longer on this floor, slower to disappear from the corner of my eye. Especially near that door.

When I wrapped my hand around the handle, its warmth startled me. The door opened with almost no resistance, and as it did, something eased in the air. I exhaled without meaning to. The house seemed to exhale with me.

It was a small bedroom. The bed sat unmade, the blanket untouched except for two soft impressions beneath the dust. One larger. One smaller, curled close beside it.
The sunlight in the room chose its marks carefully again: a baking book on the nightstand, a children’s storybook, and a portable heater coated in dust. The window was shut tight. The room felt sealed, as though it had been holding its breath for years.
I stepped closer to the heater. Its dial was snapped.
A broken unit in a room with no ventilation was a quiet tragedy waiting to happen.

I looked back toward the bed. The sunlit impressions seemed so still, so settled, as though they had not been disturbed since the day they were made.

I called the local authorities and reported what I had found. There was nothing more I could do except hope that they would handle the matter with the care it deserved. While waiting for them to arrive, I left a small sign of respect behind.
I brushed the dust from the two books the sunlight had chosen.I straightened the blanket, careful not to disturb the impressions beneath it.I examined the heater and, with barely any effort, nudged its dial back into place. A tiny fix that could have spared them.

On my way out, I closed the bedroom door. The handle was cold now, the same as the rest of the house. The jasmine scent had disappeared entirely. The wind outside sounded like nothing more than wind. The stairs no longer whispered beneath my feet, and the soft turning of pages had fallen silent. The shadows stretched in an ordinary way. Sunlight lay plainly across the floors.

Before stepping outside, I noticed the toy soldier again. No longer spotless this time, it was coated in dust, and a few cobweb strands hung from its helmet. I smiled.

A quiet peace settled over me as I left. Faint, unexpected, but steady.The house felt empty now.Truly empty.
