Every Sunday I usually take a walk outside my city alone for a bit and took something to it. After eating I had to to throw the paper thing that they give you to not get your hands dirty on the food in the trash bin and when I opened it, it was empty except for this paper in the bottom that had a scary black and white image picture and a text in the bottom saying "I am onaram" 

written in Italian, which is also where I'm from. Then "text me" and a phone number starting with +1 which is unusual since in Italy they start with +39. I took the paper and brought it home and tried to message the person on WhatsApp. The person had the same black and white picture that I found on the paper in the trash bin. I said hi to him in English and it answered me in a weird language:
আপুনি এতিয়াই ওনাৰামক মেছেজ কৰি আছে। মই আপোনাক *** ৰ জৰিয়তে লগ কৰিব বিচাৰো 

The person told me to meet up in a street pretty close to my house, I told him in english why would I want to meet up with a stranger
ওনাৰাম আৰু তুমি লগ হৈ খেল খেলিব, মই তোমাক এই পৃথিৱী এৰি যাবলৈ বাধ্য কৰাম। 
This are the copy paste messages he sent me on WhatsApp and he basically told me the same thing again. To meet up. Since he didn't answer to my question and repeated the same thing again i assumed it was just a scary bot and blocked the person.

I wake up in the middle of the night with thousands of calls from +1 numbers on WhatsApp typing with their language and they all sent me a qr code after. All of them had the same scary picture of this smiling man in black and white. I blocked all of them and when I used my pc weird files showed up on mine and my moms pc, just random letters and numbers that took only kb of storage. After that my pc and my moms pc all has this thing where we get ads everywhere on Google and then a website named thegoodcaster opened automatically showing an heart message and the photo of that guy. My mom didn't know what was going on and I was s

So afraid that I went to the kitchen and cried near my parents showing them the picture of that guy with his phone number below. My mom said that we will call pc technicians to fix this. Then the absolute worst part happened; the pc flashed images of with a red hue showing gorey photos with organs and blood of me and my parents. Those photos were posted on Facebook and they edited them into that and showed them in both mine and my mother's pc. 

The weird numbers kept messaging me and thats when we called the local authorities. Then we resetted the pcs and so far nothing happened on the pcs but I still receive daily messages from this person in his weird language telling me to meet up.[photo](https://postimg.cc/2VHQ64tt)
