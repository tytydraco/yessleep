The sharp smell hit my nose immediately, it wasn’t a stench, but something subtle, viscous, like old pus mixed with wax. Within seconds, the smell clung to me, as if I had been breathing it my whole existence, just forgotten about it for a time. I tried to move, my limbs obeyed, but felt foreign, like I had been returned a body that someone else had already used.

I lifted my eyes and saw people.

There were many, some sitting, some lying down, some simply standing with their foreheads pressed against the damp, cracked walls. Some were completely naked, exposing monstrous wounds, some fresh, others clothed in tatters soaked with either blood or mold. Some had no eyes, others no mouths. One man, gray-haired with sagging skin, was pulling at his belly as if sculpting something out of himself. He noticed me staring and grinned, but his lips were sewn shut, and the grin resembled more a painful scar.

Some prayed, whispering various prayers in their own languages; the words didn’t form meaning, only cacophony. I looked around and immediately clenched my teeth from the sharp, pulsing pain in my temples, it took me a couple seconds to recover and realize the walls were too close. 

Everything around me was narrow and damp, as if I were inside the gut of a dead giant. There was no ceiling, above stretched endless darkness, yet strangely, water dripped from it. Or something like water, but it was cold, icy even. It fell onto the faces of those who stood with heads raised and mouths open, as if they drank a rain that only made them drier.

“Welcome, friend,” rasped a voice from the right.

I turned and saw a man nailed to a cross; the whole thing looked like a naive replica of a crucifixion, with rusty nails and damp ropes. He was thin, his skin cracking like parchment charred at the edges, but his face… His face looked tired, like that of a man who’d long since stopped hoping for morning.

“Where am I? What the hell is this?”

He shook his head.

“Purgatory, I suppose. Or what was meant to be, but… Seems God forgot about us.”

I laughed, weakly, more out of fear than doubt.

“You’re joking, right? What is this… What is all this? A dream, right?”

Instead of answering, the crucified man moved his hand, causing bone to protrude from flesh, and something white, like flour, spilled to the ground. Watching it nearly made me vomit, I quickly turned away and looked at the damp wall, from whose tiny cracks some kind of liquid oozed.

I tried to remember anything, and panic seized me instantly, inescapable, impossible to suppress. With every second, breathing became harder. Purgatory? It was like being struck in the head with an icy dagger, I remembered I’d been a Catholic in life, though not fanatically. I went to church on holidays, confessed, sometimes prayed and that’s all I could remember.

Why did I end up here? For minor sins? But I remembered nothing of my life, what had I done to deserve this? Or maybe it was Hell? Thoughts wouldn’t come together; the feeling of not knowing tore me apart.

I moved forward, at first slowly, stepping carefully, looking around, then, overtaken by a dreadful anxiety, I ran as fast as I could through the darkness, passing the people around me. One man sat in a puddle of his own fingernails, pulling them out one by one and arranging them into patterns, a woman wrapped in bandages held a headless child’s doll and whispered it a lullaby, scratching her chest to the bone as she did. But I kept running, until my lungs burned and my legs gave out.

Falling to the floor, trying to catch my breath, my eyes filled with tears when I saw I was in a room identical in size to the one I’d awakened in, only the people here were different. One walked in circles, wearing his feet down to bone, another tore at his own skin.

“What are you doing?! Why… Why all this?!” I screamed at the man flaying himself, tearing my vocal cords.

“To feel something”, he answered lifelessly, continuing to strip off his skin, flinching slightly with each monotonous motion.

“This can’t be! No, this is… this isn’t real!”

I screamed, my voice breaking, but no one cared; everyone was busy with their own misery. I pounded the floor with my fist, every cell in my body filled with pure horror. Then, one of the doors opened, and an old man entered the room. His face was etched with deep wrinkles, and instead of eyes, there was a yellow film. He looked at me and smirked, rasping:

“Still don’t get where you are? Don’t believe it, huh? No one does, until they understand there’s no end here.”

“Screw you!” I roared, convulsing in sobs and in response, the old man merely lifted me up and led me to another door.

Opening the next door, I saw not a room as before but… a bridge. We walked a few steps, the heavy, rusted metal beneath our feet creaked softly, dented and scarred, and around us there was nothing but fog, white and thick like milk. It stretched in every direction, barely revealing the outlines of other bridges, twisting and rising, and at the end of each one was a door, leading to another room of damp walls and maddened people.

“But… what about God? If this is purgatory, we’re supposed to be purified of sins here, right?” I rasped, staring at the old man with hope, like a stray cat staring at a butcher’s window.

“In theory… But in reality, there’s no cleansing. There’s nothing here, or if there ever was, there isn’t now. Believe me, kid, I’ve been here since before this damned fog even existed. I was like you, but over time you start to remember why you’re here. The thing is, no one else cares. No matter how much you pray or repent, whatever you do, there’s no way out. This is our fate, not Heaven, but not Hell either.”

The old man’s voice was hopeless, and I was so afraid I couldn’t breathe, even though my mouth stayed open. My eyes, my mind, my whole body trembled, and then I asked in a breaking voice:

“Then why do they all hurt themselves? What for, I don’t understand.”

“Everyone hopes they’ll be let out if they torture themselves, prove they repent through pain, since words don’t help. Me, I don’t care for that. I think our situation is shit enough without mutilating ourselves too.”

“So what do I do? What do I do here?”

The old man fell silent, and a tomb, like silence settled between us, no wind, no sun, only my quiet, heavy breathing. Ten seconds felt like eternity, until the old man pointed into the fog:

“You can go there. Or into another room. You can go back, whatever.”

I couldn’t hold back, my body moved faster than my mind, and I lunged at the old man, grabbing his throat and squeezing with all my strength. My eyes filled with blood, a vein bulged on my forehead, and I screamed:

“WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?! JUST WALK BACK AND FORTH?! THERE HAS TO BE A WAY OUT, THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING! TELL ME, TELL ME, BASTARD, WHAT IS THIS PLACE?! HOW DO I GET OUT?!”

The old man didn’t resist or show any emotion, not even pain, though I was squeezing hard. I cried and screamed at him until he finally forced out:

“Try squeezing harder. Maybe that’ll help.”

I let him go and collapsed to the floor, curling up and covering my eyes with my hands. This can’t be real, I told myself, but the tears kept coming. It had to be a dream, or maybe a drug trip, but I repeated again and again that it wasn’t true. And suddenly, the thought, if this really is purgatory, and if everything the old man said is true, then I’ll spend eternity here, never knowing why I was sent here…

I started to laugh. I shut my eyes tight and laughed, long and hard, my body shook with fear and laughter, hope clung to me that when I opened my eyes, I’d be in a bed at home, maybe with a wife, maybe with kids, but…

Opening my eyes, I saw only emptiness above me, crushing, hopeless, a foolish smile froze on my face, and once again tears rolled down my cheeks. Struggling to my feet, legs like cotton, too light to hold me, too heavy to step, I saw the old man disappearing into the fog, and I began to whisper into the void:

“Please… Lord… I don’t know why… I don’t remember who I was, I don’t remember my sins, but… I can’t go on like this… Please. Please, let it end, let me die, or… or wake up, or disappear, Lord, I beg you… Not the bridges, not the doors, not the people… not the bridges… Please… Please…”

Silence. Silence stretched like a rope slowly wrapping around my throat. There was nothing, no light, no sign, only the bridge and the fog, and my breathing turning into pitiful, groaning wheezes.

If this is a dream… then I… I have to hurt myself, and I’ll wake up. Taking a deep breath, I slammed myself into the rusty bridge floor, the pain sharp and fierce. Gritting my teeth, eyes clenched shut by instinct, I forced them open, but… I was still there. On the bridge. Touching my forehead with two fingers, I saw blood on them, soon dripping to the bridge floor, real and warm.

No, I thought, I won’t spend eternity here, going mad like all these sick ones tearing off their skin and twisting their joints. I won’t suffer endlessly, I won’t endure this damned smell another second.

Standing on the edge of the bridge, below me was only whiteness, not soft or inviting. It was colorless, like oblivion, without depth. My heart pounded in my chest, like trying to break free. I didn’t know what was below. The end? Something worse? Maybe I’d just fall forever? I had to try. The fog beneath me shifted slightly, as if waiting, knowing what was about to happen. It wasn’t hostile, it was indifferent. Everything here was indifferent.

“I’m sorry… Forgive me for everything…”

I didn’t know whom I whispered it to, myself, or God, or those I didn’t remember, those I’d hurt. After that, I took a step forward, still hoping that maybe I would wake up, but instead I was falling down, absolutely without a sound. At first it felt like flying, then like dreaming, and then like dying. I was falling for a long time, so long that I began to think the fall was my new existence, when suddenly I felt solid ground beneath my feet. It was a bridge. But a different one, not the one I had jumped from.

I turned my head and saw people standing along the bridge, some were sitting or lying down, some were so mutilated it looked like they were one continuous wound rather than a human body. Some were eyeless, some were crawling, tearing off their nails in blood, and some, like that old man, had accepted it and were staring into the whiteness below with empty faces. There were no signs that I had ever jumped. It was at that moment I understood everything, where I had ended up, but I didn’t know what awaited me.

I didn’t feel time. It didn’t move here, it turned over, rolled, rotted, and began again. Sometimes, instead of the deathly silence, there was a whisper, a scraping sound, a scream, not from pain, but because there were no words left.

I didn’t want to be like the people who mutilated themselves, hoping to atone for their sins. I wanted to find a way out, even the slightest hint that one existed, some sign that all this could be ended. I walked and walked, passing through rooms and other bridges, witnessing monstrous scenes.

In some rooms there was a huge crowd of people, praying and confessing sins they had and sins they didn’t have, in others people were lying down, and you could think they were corpses, because they didn’t move at all, not even blinked. But they were breathing. Each room, each bridge, was a repetition of the same. While crossing another bridge, I saw a man breaking his own fingers, glancing up at the sky, that wasn’t there, with pleading eyes, and whispering:

“Please... I told everything... Let me out...”

A woman was trying to strangle some old man, who screamed and fought back, and a very young guy, maybe twenty years old, was banging his head against the wall, over and over again.

"If I kill myself again and again, maybe it’ll all reset? Maybe then I’ll disappear..." he was speaking in French, but I understood him.

I didn’t know why I kept going, or how long I had been walking at all. At one moment it felt like I had passed through hundreds of rooms, and at another just a few. I prayed, first sincerely, then out of fear, then out of despair, but nothing helped. I encountered many people on my path, but in the end I forgot about them already by the time I entered the next room; many of them had gone mad and were trying to kill not only themselves, but others too.

"Where’s the exit?! Where the fuck is the exit?! How much longer do I have to stay here?! I got it, I understood, I suffer every fucking second! What do you want from me?!" screamed a man trying to rip out another’s tongue, who had said that you just needed to wait and then God would understand they had changed.

I didn’t know what exactly I was trying to find. Not an exit, no, I had come to terms with the fact that there wasn’t one. Meaning? That too, no, there was simply no point in spending time tormenting yourself, or walking through an endless number of rooms. So what was I searching for? Maybe a point where I would cease to exist as "me", would finally lose my mind to the point I’d stop being conscious and no longer understand who I am and what’s happening to me.

To be honest, I had already started to forget who I was. I began forgetting my name, my voice; if at the beginning I even managed to talk to a few people, then later I stopped even noticing them, those who were still sane, let alone speaking to them. I kept walking, maybe even for years, my mind slowly unraveling like a cloth soaked in water, and from the realization that nothing would ever change I began to smile, sometimes giggle, and sometimes from that same thought I would drop to my knees and start sobbing in an instant. Sometimes I spoke to myself, but it wasn’t my voice, it was someone else’s.

In the end, I fully gave in, and it wasn’t forgiveness, but just a new form of madness, where you no longer look for explanations, where you don’t hope, where you keep walking, because not walking is even scarier. This whole time I was telling myself I was looking for an exit, but in reality I was moving because it was too terrifying to accept that there wasn’t one.

I had long stopped counting how many rooms I passed, how many bridges I crossed, how many faces I saw, driven mad and mutilated by their own or others’ hands. But my feet remember. The soles were like two chunks of rotten meat, the skin had been torn off long ago, the flesh was exposed and pulsing, darkened in some spots. Every step was like a whip, like a nail driven into nerves, I could feel everything rotting inside and saw how sometimes I left a trail of blood behind me. My feet had long since become two living creatures, painfully carrying me forward, like a curse.

Hundreds of prayers, sincere, out of rage, or just automatic words I repeated as I walked:

"Forgive me. Forgive. Forgive. I repent".

"Take me".

"Kill me".

"I won’t do it again".

"I don’t even know what for".

But there was never an answer.

One day, in one of the rooms where there was no one, which was extremely rare, I sat on the floor, the stone was cold, and blood was leaking from beneath my feet. I stared at the wall, from which something was oozing, maybe water, maybe something else, and that liquid was the source of the smell, a sweet-rotten stench that made me nauseous all the time. I pulled from my mouth a metal piece that had once been a bracket in one of the rooms, and began slowly, trembling, to press it into my palm, through the skin and muscles.

Blood flowed in warm streams, but I, gritting my teeth, continued. The other hand, the shoulder, the body. I waited, cried, and laughed, prayed sincerely and begged for it all to end, but as always, nothing. No voice, no light, not even relief. Only pain, bridges, and more doors.

I closed my eyes, stood up, limping, with festering wounds that had become part of my body, but went on, because I had no choice, because sitting in that room was even worse than walking. As sweet as the thought of losing my mind through self-mutilation was, I was too afraid to go through with it, so I decided, even if there’s no way out, I must check every door while I still have legs.

After countless more rooms, I could no longer walk. My legs, black and swollen, no longer felt pain, but not because it wasn’t there, it had just become background noise, just like the screams of people, their prayers in every language of the world, no matter how hard I tried to forget it, they stayed in my head forever, unlike the faces of the people.

I began crawling on all fours, tearing the skin from my knees and palms, leaving behind wet trails streaked with pus, then on my elbows, dragging my body like a snake, trembling and half-alive, without a face.

And yet I kept going, door after door, bridge after bridge. When I opened the next door, I had no hope, I just looked at what was there and crawled on, but nothing changed. Here, only you change. I pushed open another door and froze, I thought it was a vision, some kind of mirage, but...

Inside were a man and a woman, filthy with split faces; the man was trying to strangle the woman, and she in turn bit off his fingers and clawed at him with long nails crusted with dried blood and pus. They were screaming at each other:

"I deserve this! Not you, you stupid bitch, you won’t get through!"

"Fuck you! Do you know what I went through to find him?! How much I suffered?!"

And next to them sat a creature on its knees, with broken and dirty, almost charred wings. An angel. He whispered to himself, rocking, as in prayer. Light emanated from him, dim and pale like a lamp dying in the cold. I stood frozen in the doorway, breath burning my throat, and barely managed to choke out:

"Who... are you?"

He slowly turned. His face, or rather what remained of it, looked like a blurred mask, with indistinguishable features, he had only one eye, dull and staring into the distance, his mouth stretched not sideways, but down, like a burn or a wound. His wings trembled, not with majesty, but with convulsions.

"I... am a prisoner, just like you", the angel's voice was dry, as if it spoke not with a mouth but through cracks.

"But you... you're an angel..."

"We stayed here, with you. Some tried to escape, others... forgot who they were."

I choked, and tears ran down my face, I didn’t even notice.

"I’ve crossed thousands of bridges... thousands of rooms... I don’t know why I’m here," my hoarse voice broke into a scream of despair, tearing at my weak vocal cords, "I don’t even know what I did! Why am I here?!"

The angel looked at me, and in his gaze there was no answer, only understanding.

"There is a tower, where a sacred fire burns. Come to it and give yourself to the flame, and then your consciousness will extinguish forever, and you will be free."

"And you," I whispered with my last strength, "why don’t you go?"

"I’m needed here... to give people a chance to rid themselves of this torment. I want to help those who are still searching", he said, turning his surviving eye to the side, "but I’m losing strength... I have almost none left."

He looked at those still tearing each other apart, spewing curses and tears.

"Each time I share the location of the tower, it takes from my strength. And I cannot replenish it. God... no longer answers me. He answers no one."

The angel rose, staggering, and slowly approached me, touching my forehead with his maimed hand, and for a moment I felt warmth, it felt like the warmth of a mother, though I remembered nothing of mine, like the most beautiful moment of my life. And then he left the room, vanishing into the fog.

Casting a glance at the fighting pair, who hadn’t even noticed the angel had gone, I crawled on, slowly, reeking of death and pus, but feeling something I had never felt before. Hope. Not just hope, but knowledge, for I was being pulled toward a certain place. I don’t know how to explain it, but my body was carrying me toward something I didn’t yet know.

I crawled toward the tower like a wounded animal to its den, feeling with every second that I was losing myself, my body had grown so weak, and the wounds on my elbows began to fester. I realized I was losing my mind. 

I started hearing voices where there were none, I stopped crawling not because I didn’t want to, but because I couldn’t anymore, and I lay in yet another room or on yet another bridge for a long time. Some people poked or kicked me out of curiosity, though they all knew I was still alive. And then I kept crawling.

I now looked at people differently. I wanted to help them, but I couldn’t speak, it was too painful even to breathe. Again and again, I saw people grind their teeth to dust with endless prayers, others drove their fingernails into their throats, extracting wheezes from trembling larynxes, some gouged out their own eyes, swallowed them, and screamed that now they could see more clearly.

But what stuck with me, strangely, was a teenager... I can’t say exactly how old he was, but he was young. He gnawed off his fingers so they wouldn’t sin, and then sobbed uncontrollably, begging for both his arms to be cut off.

Some people talked, even gathered in communities, some entertained themselves however they could, if it can be called that. They played, talked. I had seen such things before, but now, for some reason, there were more groups here. Some had sex, satisfying their needs, while I kept crawling, blood-filled eyes leaving black streaks of blood behind me.

As I was crawling across another bridge, I was surrounded by four people, one woman and three men, they grabbed me with bony hands, their mouths were drooling, some of their faces rotting. The woman prayed while the three men carried me to the edge of the bridge, and all my attempts to resist were futile. I had no strength to scream, to speak, to fight.

"We beg, we pray, we offer sacrifice! Take him, Lord, I beg you!" the woman screamed in a fanatical frenzy, and only then did I notice that parts of her ears had been bitten off.

"Give flesh, give blood, repent, wretched one..."

The last thing I heard before they threw me from the bridge.

I remembered how long ago I had jumped from a bridge myself, hoping to escape this place, and now the fall was no different from the last. I was falling endlessly again, unable to cry or scream. I once more gave myself fully to the fall.

And then silence. Instead of another bridge, where there were always wheezes or whispered confessions, I heard nothing but silence. I lay there, unable to rise, but not on a bridge — inside a room. The fire before me was not red or yellow, but blue. It moved slowly, like the breath of someone about to die. The blue flame barely moved, only smoldered like embers in which a blaze was forming. This was the tower, I knew it at once, the one the angel had spoken of. And then, finally, I was able to cry.

Not like before, from despair, fear, or resentment, but from joy. I couldn’t believe it, this was the end. I had found it. I made it.

"Thank you..." I whispered, feeling my vocal cords tear, "Thank you, Lord... Thank you."

I hunched before the blue fire, with dirty palms, scraped knees, and rotting feet, my lips were cracked and torn, my right eye barely opened. Crawling closer to the fire, I felt warmth. The fire wasn’t hot, it was alive. It didn’t burn, it called. It felt like a mother’s embrace, and with every inch, I felt lighter.

Just as I was about to touch the flame, I felt a sudden cold behind me, like an icy hand had touched the back of my neck. Turning, I saw him.

A figure, tall and gaunt, wings like scorched fabric, face blinding but glowing from within. It was an angel, but not just any angel... I knew, don’t ask how, I just knew it was the Archangel Gabriel. I struggled to my knees as he simply stood there, looking at me in white robes, and with a trembling voice I managed to ask:

"Why?.. Why all this?"

I broke down.

"Who am I?! What did I do?! Why?! Explain, what did I do to deserve this?! What did all the others do to be tormented like this?! Why are there thousands of bridges?! Why does no one answer?!"

Gabriel looked at me with endless weariness, so profound I had never seen anything like it in any living being, not the dying, not anyone I’d met here.

He answered simply and clearly. His voice echoed with a thousand voices and sounded like a choir:

"I don’t know."

Those three words... there was no lie in them. Only emptiness.

"But... what did I do to end up here?"

"Nothing wrong, Elias," Gabriel replied, lowering his gaze to the burning blue flame.

"Then why am I here? Why in purgatory?"

"Purgatory doesn’t exist."

Those words made my heart stop, and the ringing in my ears grew louder, so loud it deafened me and made it impossible to think.

"How... but..."

"You’re in Heaven, Elias. Or rather, what’s left of it after God’s departure".

I couldn’t believe it. Everything inside me shrank to the size of a grain. All my organs ached, refusing to accept what I’d just heard.

"He left?.. Where?"

He didn’t answer.

"We... we tried to save Heaven", he slightly shook his head and seemed not to breathe, "but we didn’t have enough strength. Angels vanished, one after another. Some dissolved in prayer, some in madness. In the end, only I remained, and a few dozen others, whom I sent to help people find their way here. If once Heaven was the most beautiful place imaginable, now... much of it has vanished into the void. And what’s left has been deformed. I no longer have the power to restore it."

"And this fire?" I could barely speak.

"The last spark. The last chance to find true peace, where consciousness ceases entirely."

"Then... why don’t you go and tell everyone where this fire is? So people don’t suffer forever?"

"I can’t go far from it. I created it. It feeds on me. Those who are worthy in soul, or guided by angels, come and find peace. Those who’ve lost their minds... they no longer care for salvation, though they believe otherwise."

Gabriel looked at me with sorrow while I trembled in a voiceless sob, whispering the next question:

"And Hell? Does Hell exist?"

"It does," Gabriel sighed, and it seemed the weight of the world was in that sigh, "but in Hell, the torment never stops."

My hands trembled at the thought that this place was hardly any different, from the feeling of utter hopelessness, I cursed myself and hated all living things for being granted life. Could it really be that after death, you either go to Hell to be tortured for eternity, or here, where you torture yourself for eternity?

All my views on life, everything inside me, was destroyed in an instant.

"What should I do?"

Gabriel came closer, touching me with light and whispering softly:

"You can find your peace here, forever. Or I can return you. On Earth, you haven’t died yet."

"Return?" I froze. "But..."

"You have two beautiful daughters", Gabriel interrupted me, raising his hand and touching my head, "a loving wife, and a dog who’s still waiting for you by the window. You are happy, even if you don’t remember it".

"But what if I die again?"

"You’ll return here. But... time works differently here. On Earth, three minutes have passed since your heart stopped. Here... it’s been much longer. I don't know how long I’ll be able to keep this fire burning. The choice is yours, my son".

My heart would either race uncontrollably or stop with each word of our dialogue. In the end, with a heavy exhale, I managed to squeeze out:

"I want to come back. I want to live".

Gabriel nodded, and for the first time, his eyes flared with something like relief.

"So be it. Then forgive me. I release you."

He touched my forehead.

I inhaled sharply, like a drowning man, my chest filled with pain, sharp, but alive.

"He's got a pulse! Pulse is back! Pressure support, quickly!"

Through the indistinct noise, I heard a voice, not heavenly, but alive and human, the sound of sirens deafened me, the light was blinding, I smelled blood and antiseptic, saw lips whispering something. I was in an ambulance, and I was alive.

As I was told later, I had been in an accident, my heart had stopped for three minutes, but by some miracle, they managed to save me. I really did have a wonderful wife and two beautiful little daughters who came to my hospital room and drew me a picture: a sun, a house, and all of us together and then I realized I would make the same choice again, I would walk through the same rooms and bridges, breathe that damned fog for eternity, just to see my daughters once more.

I was discharged after four months, I had a broken arm and numerous bruises and injuries. I never told anyone what I had seen, not even my wife. I just held her tightly and cried silently at night so I wouldn’t wake the girls. Over time, I began to convince myself that it had all been a fantasy, my dying delirium, that it was all just the product of my inflamed brain. The rotting legs, the archangel, the God who had abandoned us... It was easier to live that way.

Eventually, my family and I went to the sea again, I enjoyed the scent of the wind and realized that every second of life should be treasured.

That was in 2023. But now...

In our living room, there’s an icon of the Archangel Gabriel, old, passed down from my grandmother, and it’s faded. At first, it was barely noticeable, the gold of the halo turned grayish, then the snow-white wings became dull, like worn fabric. The face faded, like an old photograph. I blamed it on the icon being old, but today I decided to step closer.

While the kids played in the other room and my wife was making dinner, the eyes of Archangel Gabriel looked at me, but they no longer held the light they once had. I recognized that gaze. Tired, humble, lonely. He was fading.

"Daddy, why are you just standing there?" — my seven-year-old daughter Emma ran up to me, tugging at my pant leg, — "Come play!"

"Yes, sunshine... Just a second, Daddy will say a prayer, and then he’ll come to you".
