If Satan were to conduct a massive Satanic attack against a community/city I would expect him to do the following. Satan would use extraordinary diabolical possession, through which people could perceive direct communication in the form of satanic whispers. His typical strategy would target the head of each household, manipulating them with fear and temptation, leading them to misguide their family into aligning with satanic forces. Once under his influence, families often leave their neighbourhood to influence others in the wider community, and this results in long-term isolation and psychological pressure on those who remain steadfast in resisting Satan. The resulting silence gives Satan an ideal environment to attack individuals further with his whispers.

Satan doesn't limit his attacks to just whispers—he also uses people under his control to to psychologically and physically threaten those who refuse to submit. As a skilled hunter of mankind, Satan anticipates people's efforts to escape his influence and sets up ambushes and snares along the way. He afflicts friends, family, and entire communities with extraordinary possession, ensuring they will not support you in your struggle. By exploiting selfishness and group pressure, he manipulates the majority into compliance. Satan thrives on the fact that many people do not believe in his existence, making his influence even more pervasive.

Beyond psychological manipulation, Satan employs visual psychology as well. He causes darkening and puffiness around the eyes of those he influences, creating the illusion that his control is widespread. His tactics heavily rely on the ignorance of people, many of whom are unaware that everyone is susceptible to Satan’s influence. While his attacks are often subtle and covert, he can also be overt, using his voice and external manipulation in a "shock and awe" strategy to make you vulnerable. This tactic can lead people to stop relying on God for protection, which is another layer of his deception. His influence is profound and can systematically attack, assimilate, and deviate nearly an entire city.

Although Satan cannot read stored memories, he often asks leading questions, like "What are you going to do?" to draw your ideas into your short-term memory, which he can then access. It is crucial not to engage with these whispers or respond in any way other than invoking God's word. Never try to bear the burden alone; that's exactly what Satan desires. Doing so will always lead to failure.

Satan has the ability to understand and speak in all human languages. He skilfully uses language as a weapon knowing what to say and how to say it to create the desired effect. Throughout his attack Satan will try to become your sincere advisor by offering you options which at first glance seem reasonable but upon closer inspection you can see they are designed to ensnare and destroy.

Satan somehow knows who people are and targets disbelievers, those with weak faith, the ignorant, and criminals first, generating a ripple effect of influence within society. These people align themselves with Satan’s bidding, drawing others into the same. Satan leaves those of strong faith and knowledge—those who could organize effective resistance—ignorant of his presence until his influence is strong enough to overpower or subdue them. In the meantime, he allows businesses to continue as usual, using his followers as trojan horses to infiltrate the community to maintain an illusion of normalcy and to spread misguidance so that those unaware of his attack come under his influence but remain oblivious to his presence.

Satan also exploits people’s secrets, using them for blackmail. This is why it is essential to confess your sins or, better yet, avoid sin entirely. He aims to induce a fight-or-flight response, confusing people into thinking that others are the cause of their problems rather than Satan himself. He encourages people to flee and urge their friends and families to do the same. However, never start conflicts or flee, as doing so allows Satan to gain a foothold. This behaviour makes you appear as if you're under satanic influence, igniting human conflicts that work against you. Satan’s goal is to scatter people rather than unite them in faith against him.

Additionally, Satan attempts to obscure his role in the attack by creating scapegoats. He uses spiritual attacks to instil guilt and fear and gets his followers to slander scapegoats so that the community turns against them, blaming them for the possession and chaos. Satan uses this manoeuvre to induce those that follow him into attacking the righteous and innocent people. This way he destroys everyone through the strategy of divide and conquer.

Considering that Satan is a liar, thief, and murderer, his plots are designed to destroy and kill, resisting him can lead to severe consequences in your life.
