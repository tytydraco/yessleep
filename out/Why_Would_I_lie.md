“Secrets? I don't have any. Particularly not those types of secrets.”

I was with my girlfriend. We hadn't been together for that long. A kind girl with a warm soul. In order to get to know each other better she came up with the ‘don’t ask questions’ game. 

“Well, it sounds weird but hear me out.” She said in a playful tone. “We ask questions we don't really want to know the answers to and if by the end of the night we see each other just as two humans who like each other and not disgusting creeps; we might end up married.”

“Married?” I asked. She smiled at my surprised expression. Suddenly I had an idea. “It's not a secret just personal b…”

“What is it?!” She excitedly interrupted me. She was smiling the whole time. It was so cute. She was too cute. 

“I'll tell you.” I said in a serious tone.

I inhaled some air and let it out slowly. She was smiling but now she was forcing it. 

“I killed my mom.” I said flatly. 

Her smile disappeared instantly. But just as soon as it went it came back.

“Haha, you almost got me.” She said trying to play it off as a joke. 

“She was obsessed with me. She said I was her son and no woman was taking me away from her.” I continued as if I hadn't heard her.

“What the… come on dude.” She begged. “Stop the joke. It isn't funny, you know? Please?”

“I finally got a girlfriend. A girl so pretty I dared go on a date with her.” I couldn't stop anymore. I had to finish telling her my ‘secret.’ 

“She started yelling. I couldn't take it anymore.”

“Did she try to kill you?” She asked in a sudden change of tone. As if she understood. Now that was weird. 

“What? No.” I replied, almost losing my cool for some reason. “All the yelling just made me want to stab her. So I did.”

At this moment is when things got weirder. She suddenly grinned. And that was enough for my heart to skip a beat. 

“When was this?” She asked. 

I didn't know why but I was too committed to the story so I just kept going. 

“A little over two weeks now.”I said now weary of how she'd react to that. 

“Awwe, you killed her for me.” Her expression softened. “That's really good ‘cause,” she paused for a second and lowered her voice. “I’m a serial killer.”

I'm not an expert but her expression and body posture she suddenly adopted told me she wasn't lying. Problem is; I was. I was diagnosed as a pathological liar. I just wanted to test her. Why the fuck did I do this? 

I had to tell her immediately and she took it lightly.

“Oh, well me too.” She said going back to the sweet soft face she had been putting on since I met her. 

“Are you though?”

“Hey, I believed you, why won't you believe me?” she asked. “Come on.” 

She tapped my shoulder as she stood up and signaled me to follow her. I stayed in my seat. At the park. At night. I was frozen in place. 

“Ugh… don't be stupid…” she said. Letting her annoyance show up for a second. But she regained her composure and did something to convince me. 

“Are you gonna skip on these babies?” She flashed me. 

I gotta admit I almost forgot about everything but I didn't let myself think with my other head. It was the first time I've seen anything. She said she wanted to take it slow last date. 

“Also, you started it. For all I know you could actually be a real monster. I'm taking a huge risk here too.”

“A woman would never…” 

“Oh, fuck off.” She interrupted. “I like the rush. What if you actually killed your mommy for me.” She grinned. “Now how could I ever not reward such an act of love?”

My mom died of a stroke a month ago. And she loved me but not like that. She was a kind person who put up with my shit since I was little. I couldn't help but wonder why I was such a stupid person to use her death in this way. I just couldn't understand it. 

I started to think maybe I should just go with her. I deserved it. So I followed this girl… for a good ten seconds before I understood I was being led to the slaughter house. And just ran away. 

She never learned where I lived so she kept sending messages asking me to meet her. She said it was my fault. And it was but she still took time everyday to send me extremely spicy pictures. She knew I couldn't block her. And she was right about that too. I liked her despite how terrified I was. I might've been the idiot but something about her just felt wrong. It was less than a second but she showed her true face. And it wasn't pretty. But she looks like a top model. 

Or am I being too paranoid? I mean I started it. And maybe we could get married. 

Just what the fuck do I do?
