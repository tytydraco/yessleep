Wednesday

Yesterday I was sick all day, I felt hungry when I had eaten, despite eating too much, I still had an insatiable hunger. The hallucinations became stronger, my feet hurt as if I had walked all over the world, I have an abysmal thirst, and drinking liquids doesn't help, it sounds silly, but what is supposed to calm my discomfort, it didn't work, my brother didn't. He still arrives, they called him back from work, and something even stranger happened, I forgot how to open a door, a normal door, with a knob, I didn't know how to open it until after a while, I was able to rediscover that fascinating technology, which I had forgotten from one day to the next, and what bothers me the most is that my brother does not arrive, I have been calling him since yesterday, even in the early morning, since I could not sleep much, I had nightmares in the little that I slept, I dreamed that He was old, dirty, abandoned, almost blind, one eye was no longer useful, due to an accident involving glass and a struggle, but I couldn't remember more about it, he was in rags, many rags because it was very cold, as if he were at the north pole, but the strange thing is that I was in a warehouse, despite the extreme cold, in my dream I was walking non-stop, in a labyrinth of endless warehouses, with endless corridors, narrow vents but large enough to fit between a person on his knees, fluorescent lights hanging from the ceiling, under an endless amount of pipes, which in turn wrapped around the aforementioned ventilation pipes.

My belongings were based on 2 hard plastic bottles wrapped in a lot of cloth, which were empty, empty tuna cans, of which the metal lids had been used to make a kind of very rustic knife that would not withstand even half a blow. without first taking it apart, he also had a lot of rags, including dresses, jackets, polo shirts, and even tops, the best thing this man had were thick, strong boots, but so worn that you could see the steel protection on the toe, something It was also strange that he had cloth on his soles, he also had a flashlight without batteries, the batteries were stored in more cloth, apparently, this old man had 10 kilos of cloth on him, and he was weak, but he remained constant in his objective which was keep walking, as he whispered, I was looking for the stairs, because the lights would go out soon, until that moment I was seeing from the old man's eyes, until I tried to look back, to which the old man reacted, as if he had realized that I was there, in his head, and I whisper aggressively -NO, GO AWAY, YOU'RE DISTRACTING ME-.

Finally the doorbell rang, and I went to try to open it in the most normal way for my brother, but, that was not the doorbell we had, it was an old doorbell, from a house in which we lived in the past, unconsciously, since that dream. Ive had been walking without making a sound, in stockings, as if he were still on alert.

The doorbell rang again, and I was still motionless, thinking about what to do, what if it was a thief, or someone who wasn't my brother, I couldn't avoid being robbed, so I just looked through the peephole in the door, and what? It was my surprise to see no one, not a shadow, nothing.I immediately called my brother, I had to tell him that I was sick and that I had to go to the hospital, because I was already getting worried, but when he answered, he talked about how he was trying to get home but there was too much traffic, annoyed, I exclaimed - YOU COULD NOT BE IN TRAFFIC SINCE YESTERDAY-, but he responded with an excuse that it was 5 in the afternoon, on Tuesday, and that I had to calm down, to explain to him what was happening, because I was so upset, and if I was taking the syrup for nausea. After a while I calmed down, and I started to tell him about the dream I had, and he told me, that it sounded like I had been in the backrooms, when I realized that, I laughed, I had seen so many stories and creepypastas, that I got a nightmare about it, and as I continued telling him, my brother helped me understand where each element of my dream had come from, the water, the food and the cold, were due to the nausea (I didn't tell him about the hallucinations), and The other elements such as the warehouse, the knife, and so on, were due to so many nonsense that he had seen.When he arrived a couple of hours later, I was eating, since I was still hungry, he invited me to smoke a couple of cigarettes, to warm up a little, which I accepted, it's not that my passion is smoking, but I do like it. Occasionally. After that, we watched more movie, this time we watched "They Live", another old movie, but this one was more interesting. In the last movie, the one who was supposed to be the hero was actually a weakling who couldn't even win. Now I'll go to sleep on the furniture and my brother will also sleep in the living room.
