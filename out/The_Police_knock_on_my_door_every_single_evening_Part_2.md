I wanna start by saying thank you for all the kind words of encouragement and ideas on how to solve the issue that I have been dealing with, if you don't know what I am talking about, [here is part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j6ufr1/the_police_knock_on_my_door_every_single_evening/), a lot of the ideas were great but the ones that stood out to me the most was about researching the victims.

It was that suggestion that made me realize that I never got the names of any of the victims. Every single time it's been my Son, my Daughter, Wife or Husband, which makes sense I guess, you would want to be at least a little formal when delivering news like that, if all of the people are real people of course.

So I made a game plan, I decided that when an officer knocked on my door tonight I would do everything I could to figure out the name of whoever had died, maybe that could lead me closer to whatever it is that's currently going on.

I went about my evening as I would normally do, and when the doorbell finally rang I felt more prepared than ever, I had a script in my mind with every possible scenario, if I am being honest I was a little bit excited, I have been tormented by these visits every day for a month now and it finally felt like I had a plan of attack.

I opened the front door only to see nothing, nobody was standing there, there wasn't a police car on my porch and looking down the street it looked to be pretty much empty.

I furrowed my brow in confusion, there was no doubt the doorbell had been rung and it was around the time I would normally get a visit from the police, so what gives?

It was honestly by pure coincidence that i looked down, how often do you look down when walking outside your door? But I did this time, by chance, and there by my feel sat an envelope with a small jewelry box under it.

"What?" I stared at the pair for about a minute out of pure confusion before picking them both up and walking inside, shaking the small box it was clear that something was inside but I am going to be honest, I was more than a little nervous about opening it up, instead i decided to start with the letter, tearing it open I pulled out a piece of paper.

"We told you not to go to the police."

That was all the letter said.

My mouth felt dry in that moment, what did that even mean? The police had been coming to me, was someone watching me? Was this another thing that was meant for someone else?

My eyes slowly drifted over to the small jewelry box, I put the letter down and tried to steady my breath as I reached out for it and with shaky hands i tilted the lit up.

I screamed, inside, sitting on the small cushion meant for a ring sat a finger, a beautiful wedding band around the digit stained in dry blood from the severed appendage.

I quickly closed the case as I began to dry heave, I am a very Squamish person, I am not one for horror movies and I am certainly not one for blood and gore, I couldn't even stay in the house, I grabbed my phone and quickly went outside to sit on the pavement as I called the police.

The next few hours were a blur, the police arrived quickly, took both the letter and the jewelry box into evidence and I thought I would be taken in for questioning, but no.

As I sat there on the pavement with sirens lighting up the street a man sat down next to me, he put a calming hand on my shoulder and smiled warmly at me before speaking.

"Please don't blame yourself Maam, you made the right choice coming to the police when you did and we will be doing everything in our power to keep searching for your wife, stay strong, it'll be okay"

I turned to stare at him for a moment, my face still stricken with unease and disgust.

"Who are you?" Was all i could say, the finely laid plan so far from my mind that I still don't recall it now.

"Right, I'm a detective, Currently assigned to your case, I understand you are rattled, can you stay with anyone? My boys will check most of the neighborhood for whoever might have delivered the package so if you can, go to a relatives house and try and get some sleep."

I ran a hand over my eyes, I was tired, there was no doubts about it, I was exhausted and even if the police wasn't here my mind no longer felt safe at my house.

The detective got up and started walking away, but before he got too far I reached out and grabbed his hand "Wait! Can I please have your name?"

The man nodded slowly and smiled at me once more, a warm and reassuring smile "of course Maam, please call me Adam Strum."

I nodded slowly, Adam Strum, as soon as he had walked away I picked out my phone and wrote it down, I had to look into him later, it was currently all I had but it was better than nothing.

This all happened a few hours ago now, I am currently sitting in a motel room typing all this out on my phone, I don't know why but it seems messages meant for the mourning are arriving at my house, I just hope this is the worst thing I'll get.
