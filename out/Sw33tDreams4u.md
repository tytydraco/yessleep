I am writing this down to 

A: Fully understand what happened.

B: To tell my story

And 

C: To Warn everyone

To be honest. I am not a social person. I spend half of my day, sitting on my gradually fattening ass, roleplaying on Discord. And getting off on Twitter porn. Suffice to say. The day I got my Diploma from high school. I officially became a shut in.. But that was until a few weeks ago.

  I was on Tumblr. Mostly posting links to my Soundcloud page. Posting Youtube videos, and chatting with fellow Autistic people. I remember this because I was talking to one of my contacts about Jurassic Park. One of my favorite movie series. But, while I was chatting with the user. One of my posts got a comment from a user called. Sw33tDr34ms4u. In that specific post, I was talking about one of my favorite bands. Seether. Now I won't go into detail about what I posted. But it was an edit of a few pictures I found online, with some lines from a few of their songs. 

But the comment, it wasn't a positive comment. And to be completely honest. It didn't even have anything to do with any of the things I've posted. But the user, commented this.

 "The depths of hell, are my playground." 

I laughed at the comment, and I followed the user. It's a habit of mine to follow users who like my posts. Being a shut in, I thought that this user was a sort of fan of some obscure metal band, wanting to branch out when it comes to my tastes in music. Now, I realize that was the dumbest choice in my life, and I have made my fair share of them.

 I forgot about the user until the next morning. When I got a dm from the user. Wanting to ask about the band, or whatever the reference was to the queen of the Succubi was. I clicked on the notification. And the user sent me something. Explaining who she was.

She said she was a demon from the darkest depths of Hell. She told me about how she saw Satan himself. And she had taken control of several men, and mothered a race of demons. She called herself the queen of the Succubi, and she wanted a new soul. To get herself out of Hell. She offered me everything I could ask for. All I needed to do was let her in. As you can expect, I didn't buy it. Being a skeptic, and with someone pulling that same exact shit on me when I first got onto Tumblr. I told her that she was crazy. And if she truly was from the darkest depths of hell, I wanted proof. I actually wanted to see what she looked like.  
She didn't bother me for a while. That was until I got a response last week.

I was listening to Hell by Disturbed. While chatting with my buddy. A user called Kidneyizzabone. Someone I consider to be a good friend. I was telling him about my newest Gacha Club Project. When I got a notification from the user. Sw33tDreams4u. She had sent me a picture of herself. I clicked on it. And I am happy that no one was in the room with me, because what she sent; wasn't kid friendly.

 It was a girl, with white hair. She was about 18 from what I could gather. However, her age wasn't what got me. It was how she was dressed.

She was nude. Save for something. Covering her nether regions. I almost fell out of my chair. This picture looked so much like a ref one of my roleplaying buddies used for one of his character. Thinking back on it. This could have been who the ref was based on. Although, this was real. Not an AI drawn image. I practically pitched a tent in my pants. In my rush to get the picture off the screen. I sent a picture of myself. My mom asked why I sent a picture of my self to a random user. So I came up with a lie. I told her that Kidneyizzabone just wanted to see what  I looked like, and she bought it.

 "It seems like you have fallen for my charms. I'll see you tonight." Sw33tDreams4u sent. Before sending a winking Emoji. "Name's Jules, I'll see you tonight." 

 She sent me a picture of my house. 

 I logged off. And use your imagination from there. Being a horny 18 year old, and being stuck indoors. I took that line, and I thought she meant it. Like See You in your dreams. I guess it was flirting. Unfortunately. I found out that she meant it quite literally.

  That night, or was it the next morning, I was having trouble getting to sleep. I was tossing and turning, and I considered listening to some music until I fell asleep. So I looked for my MP3 player. But it was gone. I felt around blindly until I turned on my desk lamp. I still didn't find it. I was thinking that I left it out in the living room. I considered going to grab it. Since my mom was most likely asleep. 

Before I could go out there and get it. I smelled something, something smoky, but sweet at the same time. Then the light bulb in my desk lamp died. Then I felt someone put their hands on my shoulder, and I felt something press against my back. "Hi cutie.." the voice of a girl said quietly.

 I took a deep breath, and I opened my mouth to scream, then someone put their hand over my mouth. I tried to fight her off. I really did. But she was stronger. "Let's play..."  I got a good luck at the figure behind me. She looked just like the picture. Only I saw something that I will never forget. She had white wings, and she had horns, and a halo. 

 "I have waited for centuries for this.......we're going to be so happy together." She said as she pinned me to my bed.  She took off my clothes, she didn't take them off. She tore them off. Then she got on top of me. I don't remember what happened next. Because I passed out.

 I woke up the next morning, my body aching. I was clothed, and I found my MP3 player next to my bed. over top of a post it note. on the post it note was a note.

"Thank you for the fun night. DM me if you want to have fun again. I know I did." 

 I tore the note in half, and I went into the living room, and my mom and Dad were talking. My Dad was getting ready for work. So I acted like everything was okay. I told my dad to have a good day at work. And a few hours later I went onto tumblr, and I blocked the user. Then my mom got my attention. 

"What's that on the side of your neck? They look like Bruises." My mom said as she handed me a cup of coffee. 

"It's fine mom.... I had the same issues when I was a kid. Bruises appeared, and they disappeared on their own." I answered, taking a sip of my coffee.  

  Things were quiet. Until today.

My dad came home from work, and I asked him how his day was at work. And he said it was good. As usual. I asked him what all did he do at work, and if he saw anything cool. He told me that he saw some cool dogs, and a cat. Then he told me that he saw something else. In the woods. There was a girl, with white hair. 

"She was out there with her tits out. I didn't get a good look at them if you want to know... I kept driving. I was running late for a pest treatment. But When I drove down that same road to get to my next Customer. The girl was gone, however. There was a sign close to the road. It read something along the lines of 'Tell your son I miss him'. Or something." Dad said as he put groceries up. "She might have been someone's girlfriend." 

  I laughed. "Yeah, why was she bare ass naked in the woods?"

"Teenagers. However, you might have liked her." Dad joked.
