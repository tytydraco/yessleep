Anyone who thinks working as a barista isn’t hard should try dealing with the mountain of people who come in at 5pm on a Monday evening. It seems like the entire population decides that the best post work or school or pilates activity is ordering the most elaborate handicraft drink known to man. Seriously, I think 90% of the customers had to make a minimum of like 14 customisations to their lattes.

Look I wouldn’t be someone to usually complain about doing the job I get paid for but looking after Ella at the same time as concocting these intricate drinks was really tiring. Yes I know that it isn’t my proudest moment moment to mix looking after my daughter with doing my job but the babysitter said she’d pick Ella up a couple of hours late and Jerry wouldn’t let me reschedule my shift.

Every few minutes, I’d sneak a glance to make sure Ella was okay or walk up to her to make sure her homework isn’t too hard or something. She’s fully engrossed in it of course. That’s an honors student for you.

The woman a couple seats down from her was probably the opposite of engrossed. When you work at a coffee shop so long you start realising that pretty much all customers fit a certain mold: yoga moms, overworked middle managers, gossiping tweens, some young intern desperately trying to finish a proposal. You don’t usually see a twitchy dark haired woman sitting alone for hours.

She’d been there since the morning and she had spent all of that time sipping on the same matcha. Ideally, I should’ve kicked her out for loitering but Jerry isn’t paying enough to do all that. She had spend all of said time analysing a face for a few minutes before moving on to the next one. Doing all this with a straight face. I was all for people watching but this was a little creepy.

The only time she’d broke her straight face was when Tommy came in. Tommy’s a cop and a regular at our shop. A regular at our shop who didn’t even say hi to the barista who’s been serving him every morning for the past year. I gave him a little less coffee for that (I am aware of the childishness of the matter). When Tommy came in, she looked like she’d seen a ghost. Tommy’s a bit of a player, she could’ve been one of his exes for all I knew.

Or she could’ve been a criminal which it turns out was the case so I let my daughter sit a couple seats over from someone who just got  arrested. Mom of the year everyone!

At around 10pm, after the midday crowd cleared out and after Ella was with the babysitter, Tommy and his partner came in to arrest her. Living in a sketchy area of a big city you kind of get used to people getting taken away but the coffee shop is in a nice area and I’ve never had a person getting arrested telling that my daughter’s going to die.

When Tommy came in with his partner and moved towards her she yelled like she was in pain. That’s not all she seemed almost rabid when she was fighting against the handcuffs like an animal cornered. She  started yelling something about how the creatures had gotten  her and how we’re doomed.

Worst of all she looked me in the dead in the eyes and said:

‘That girl you kept talking to with the pigtails, she’s next, I can see it, she doesn’t have much time to live. SAVE HER. YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER’.

I know what you’re thinking, that lady was clearly unstable and I shouldn’t let what she said to me get to my head but Jill, our babysitter just gave me a call.

She called an ambulance to take Ella to the hospital. She had a seizure. She’s in critical condition. The doctors don’t know what happened to her and how to fix it.

I don’t care if that woman’s the craziest mf alive, if there’s even a chance she knows how to save my daughter, I need to find her.

I need to find her.
