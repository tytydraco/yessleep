The clear night sky looked beautiful as i sat outside my Rv.My chest still aching form the monsters claws.These marks just added to my battle scars that were all over my body.

I did something that i don't usually do and drank some whiskey.I just needed to clear my head.As i drank the thought of my last encounter with the Laughing Demon invaded my mind, flooding my thoughts and taking over.I just couldn't forget the laughing of that thing.And the document containing all the pictures of those poor kids that fell victim to that creature.

As i continued to drink i must have passed out since i remember everything going dark.After what felt as hours i woke up on the ground.My head was hurting really bad.I felt the cold wind and the grass i was laying on was wet ,it must have rained at some point.My clothing was damp  but i wasn't cold as the alcohol was keeping me warm but i knew i should go back to the RV.

I stood up and i felt dizzy.I looked around but there was no Rv in sight.There was just trees surrounding me .And there was a mist around me making it hard to see in front of me.

I wanted to see my location by using my phone,but as my hand reached into my pocket only to find it empty.I was lost and confused and all that alcohol in me was making it hard to think.

As i tried to figure out where i was and what happened.I heard a kids voice.It was calling out for help.I ran in the direction of the voice.

I ran as fast as i could,the kids calls for help getting louder,i felt everything spinning around me .As i ran i stumbled and fell to the ground.
I fell right into some mud ,as i got up i couldn't hear the kid.My head was hurting really badly my vision was blurry.I try calling out for the kid.But there was silence.

I felt my heart pounding in my chest.My breathing was fast and rapid.The wound on my chest was hurting making in hard to breathe.

And then i heard it.A laugh,a laugh that i couldn't get out of my head for days since i first heard it.How was it still alive?And how did it escape the Men in black?My thoughts were stopped by a screams of the kid.I ran in the direction the scream was coming form i had to save the kid.

I ran  through the woods all the while the kid screamed making me run faster.But as much  i ran i couldn't reach the kid ,every time i got close it somehow got distant again.I felt as if i was running in circles.

I fell to my knees clutching the wound on my chest.Its getting hard to breathe as time went on.
The laughing never stopped i heard it even as i ran .

I didn't have any weapons other than my dagger.
With adrenaline going through my body i ran but i didn't get far before falling over a tree stump that was covered by some leaves.As i got up i saw something in the shadows.As i looked closely i saw something small huddled in the shadows against a tree.

I slowly started approaching.As i got closer i saw that it was a kid.He had a red hat and a green coat on.And was holding a teddy bear in his hand.He was crying as he looked up at me.

The Laughing Demons  laughter was getting closer.I had to defend the kid.The kid was crying more.

As i pulled out my dagger and readied myself to face that thing.I heard a familiar voice."Dad is that you?" I turned around to see my son standing there.

"Tomy is that you?What are you doing here son?"i ran up to him.

"Please dad help me im scared lets go home"
I looked at the terrified face of my son

 "Don't worry Tomy dad will protect you from the monster."

I hugged my son the need to protect him corsing through my body.Even though the danger was still there i smiled i was so happy.I missed him so much i can't believe he is here.I haven't seen him since the .... accident...

He wasn't really here with me.I took my dagger and stabbed him in the chest.As i did everything seemed to stop.The laughing,the cold wind as if the woods stood still.My vision got blurry.I feel to the ground and i saw a tall humanoid creature falling next to me.

I woke up laying against my RV.As i rubbed my eyes i saw a old man wearing a black suit standing in front of me.

"That was a close one, you almost shared the same  fate as some of our field agents." The man said with a small chuckle.

"We spent so much time ,money and resources trying to eliminate that thing but you did it in just one day.But you are one of our best hunters i knew you could get the job done." The man smiled pulling out a cigar and lightning it.

He looked down at me i was still sitting there my back against the RV.He saw the empty whisky bottle on the ground and picked it up.

"Since when do you drink Henry?The only time i saw you drinking was at the funeral."

He took one more puff of smoke and threw the cigarette to the ground and stepped on it with his foot.
"Go get some sleep and recover we will call you for the next job very soon."

After he said that, he walked away disappearing in the night.
