My grandmother was one of the first female taxi drivers in my city, Zaragoza. Because of that, she had seen and heard a lot of things.

As a kid, I loved staying over at her place and listening to her tell, again and again, the story of the time a robber held a knife to her throat, and she still had the guts to drop him off at the police station and charge him the full fare.

Also, by the time she was eighty, she’d had a tracheotomy and spoke like a robot. It scared me and fascinated me in equal measure.

Throat cancer, seven heart attacks, late-onset diabetes—none of it ever took away her sleep, or her nightly ritual of two glasses of coffee cream liqueur.

She was at peace because, as she often said, *“the radio witch”* had told her the day she would die. And that day hadn’t come yet.

I never asked her about the radio witch. I thought it was just an expression.  
  
Until one summer afternoon, she called the whole family over for lunch.

After dessert, she looked around the table and said: “Tomorrow I’m going to die. Tomorrow is the day the radio witch told me.” We laughed it off. She looked great for ninety, her latest tests were excellent—especially considering her medical history.

She was also a notorious prankster, the kind of person who could keep a straight face while telling you the most absurd lie.

She refused to see any doctor.

That night, as I stayed with her until she went to bed, something about the way she hugged me made my stomach knot. It felt… final. When I asked why she was so certain, she told me a story she had never shared before.

Over forty years ago, during her taxi-driving days, she listened religiously to a late-night radio show that was wildly popular in Zaragoza. One of the recurring guests was a fortune teller who had quite a reputation.

My grandmother had lost a bet with a fellow driver who also listened to the program. The loser had to call in and ask the fortune teller the exact day of their death.

The “witch” resisted at first. But after some pushing, she relented and gave my grandmother a date: **August 12, 2024.**

"That’s tomorrow," my grandmother told me. "And she was never wrong."

The next day, she died.

Her death left us all in shock. There was no real explanation. I mean, technically there was: she was very old, and her body had been through A LOT. But why did she die when she seemed healthier than ever?

Nobody mentioned the radio witch, even though we had all heard it. It became a taboo.

My mother filed a negligence complaint against the doctors, citing a minor dosage error in one of my grandmother’s medications. It was the kind of clerical mistake that had happened before with no harm done. But it was easier to focus our energy on that than face the elephant in the room.  
  
The doctors had to perform an autopsy—something rarely done when someone that old, with so many conditions, dies in bed. But they were obligated.  
  
The cause of death was as strange as the death itself: my grandmother had a piece of metal, thin as a needle, lodged near her heart—overlooked in every chest X-ray she’d ever had. It must have entered her body when she was a child and stayed there her whole life… until, for some reason, on the night of August 12, 2024, it shifted by a millimeter… and tore her aorta.

A year ago today.

Nobody at home wants to talk about it. But I can’t stop wondering: who was the radio witch?
