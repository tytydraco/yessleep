When I was a child, my family moved a lot. I never finished a whole school year in the same town I started it in. There was one summer that I will never forget as long as I live — the summer I spent in Greenville.

We moved to Greenville to sort out my late grandfather's estate. The school year had just finished, so my little brother James and I had the whole summer to get to know the other kids before the school year started — a luxury we were not commonly afforded.

I’d never really had a friend before that summer. I didn't see the point, since we would be leaving in a few months anyway. But Dad had assured us that we would be staying here for a whole year. I figured I could give the whole friend thing a go. That's when I met Braden, my next-door neighbour. He was eleven — so was I — and we both liked playing in the woods. He was my first real friend, and I wish every day that he had never had the misfortune of meeting me.

I was tagging along with Braden's family to the convenience store one day when his brother, an older boy named Justin, started talking.

“They say there is a monster in the woods out past the old church,” Justin told us, gesturing to the derelict, overgrown building. “They say if you ask it a question, it'll answer — no matter what you ask — but it takes something in return.”

“Stop trying to scare them,” Braden’s mum cut Justin off.

“I'm not... I'm trying to warn them,” he replied in an exaggerated spooky voice.

When we got back to Braden's place, we rushed to his bedroom to make our plans for that night. I asked my mum if I could stay at Braden's place. She said yes, and I packed my bag to stay over. We were going to hunt that monster. We packed snacks, a flashlight, Braden's baseball bat, and some of James's chalk for marking a path in the woods.

The clock in Braden's room didn't work, so we just waited until a few hours after dark to sneak out the window. We made our way around to the side of the house where we had stashed our bikes earlier that day and pedalled off into the night.

We parked our bikes at the back of the old church and began to make our way into the woods.

“What are you gonna ask?” I whispered, elbowing him gently.

“I dunno, what are you gonna ask?” he replied.

We spent the rest of that hour or so trying to decide what questions to ask. I don’t remember what we eventually settled on, but whatever it was had no impact on the events that followed.

After a good while of walking through the woods, marking trees with chalk as we went, we saw a light in the woods ahead. We crouched down but kept approaching to see if we could figure out what it was. When we were close enough to see who it was, I was shocked to see my grandfather standing there with a lantern in his hand.

“Grandad, is that you?” I called to the elderly man.

“No,” came the reply a second later — in my voice.

“Dude, that was your voice. What is that thing?” Braden whispered to me.

Then came the reply in my voice again: “I am known by many names. I am that which people of days long gone feared. I am the one that dwells outside of the firelight. I am the one who watches nations rise and fall. I am the origin of fear and the end of reason. I have been here since time began. I will witness the end.” At that, the old man collapsed to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut. Braden turned to me and spoke in my voice:

“You have no further business here. Return to your home now.”

He reached out his hand to touch my forehead. The instant his skin touched mine, he vanished — along with our only flashlight.

“Run home, child. Your mother will worry if you are gone too long,” came my voice from the woods surrounding me.

I ran as fast as I could, but running through the woods at night is difficult in the best of circumstances. And this was hardly the best of circumstances.

As I stumbled through the dark, I began to hear laughter in the treeline — my laughter. The laughter moved all around me. Between the trees, I saw glimmers of light. I ran, my feet pounding against the ground, often stumbling over roots and branches. The clouds had cleared a little, which gave me just enough light to avoid the bigger roots.

Ahead of me through the trees, I could just see the old church under a flickering streetlight. I was almost out of the woods. The footsteps and laughter were right on my heels. I could feel hot breath on the back of my neck as I burst through the treeline.

All the sound stopped at once. I turned to look back and saw the light retreating back into the woods.

I picked up my bike and made my way back home. My family had locked all the doors and windows, so I snuck back into Braden's room through the open window we had used just a few hours earlier.

The following day, Braden's mother asked where Braden was. I tried to tell her, but the words simply wouldn't come out. The whole town banded together to search the woods, but no trace of him was ever found.

In the days that followed, I spent almost every spare minute I had retracing our path through the woods. I followed the chalk marks right up until a storm washed them off the trees. And even then, I kept looking. I knew Braden was gone, but I thought maybe I could find the thing that took him.

I never did.

Braden's family never looked at me the same after that day. I could tell his parents blamed me. They didn't want me to know, but I could tell. Justin outright refused to talk to me. I think he thought I did something. I guess he wasn't that far off.

My family packed up and left Greenville about a month after the official search was called off, though Braden’s family kept looking.

After several doctors, psychiatrists, and speech therapists, I eventually came to terms with my muteness. My family still doesn't believe me, but I don't blame them. It's difficult to believe when they still hear my voice from the woods when we go camping, and from dark corners when the power goes out.

If ever you find yourself in Greenville, beware the thing in the woods. It may offer secret knowledge and truths untold — but when you leave, the voice it speaks with is yours, and in your dreams, the face it wears is your own.
