I've always had a strange fascination with mirrors. Not just the way they reflect our image back to us, but the idea that they might hold some supernatural power. Since my younger days I believed that mirrors could be portals to another dimension, a place where the unknown and the terrifying reside.  
  
But I never thought that my obsession would lead me down a path of true horror.  
It all started when I found an old, ornate mirror at a garage sale. I couldn't resist its intricate design and the fact that it seemed to call out to me. I brought it home and hung it in my living room. At first, everything seemed normal. But as the days went on, I started to notice things on the reflective surface that shouldn't be there.  
  
The first time it happened I caught a glimpse of something in the mirror out of the corner of my eye. When I turned to look at it directly, it disappeared before I could properly register what I was seeing.  
I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but soon the visions in the reflection became more frequent and more detailed. Each time I had the mirror in my peripheral view I saw something twisted in the glass only for it to vanish when I turned towards it but the imagery was already burned into my mind.  
It was a grotesque face, staring at me with sinister intent. The eyes were black pits, and the mouth was a gaping maw filled with razor-sharp teeth. The skin was gray and mottled, and the hair was long and stringy. It was like nothing I had ever seen before, and it filled me with a deep sense of dread.  
  
I decided I had to do something about the mirror. So, I decided to board it up, to seal it off from the rest of the world. But even with the mirror gone, the visions didn't stop. Everywhere I looked, there was a reflective surface, Windows, car mirrors, even the surface of my phone screen, and in each one, I could glimpse the twisted figure, staring back at me. It was like it was following me, haunting me.  
I couldn't take it anymore. I started to have public freakouts, seeing the dark figure everywhere and screaming at it to leave me alone. People thought I was crazy, and I couldn't blame them. But I knew the truth, the horrors on the other side of the mirror were still after me.  
I could feel myself losing my sanity. I had to find a way to stop this, to close the portal and banish the creatures back to where they came from.  
  
I knew I had to confront the mirror, to finally put an end to my torment. So, I unboarded the mirror and waited in front of it, determined to see the horrid figure once and for all.  
And then, it happened. The twisted thing manifested in the glass, and I saw it clearly for the first time. But what I saw was not a creature from another dimension, not a being from another world. It was something else entirely.  
The horror of the realization hit me like a freight train. The creature wasn't in the mirror, it never was. The mirror was never a gateway into another dimension. The thing I had been seeing was something that was attached to the back of my head.  
I watched in horror as the creature silently emerged through my skin, tearing its way out of my face.  
It began to writhe and twist. It looked around for a moment, as if it was taking in its surroundings. The atmosphere grew cold and with slow deliberation, the thing slowly rest its eyes upon me. I could neither move nor scream. I could not take my gaze from it nor quell the way it gripped my heart in a vice.   
  
It's lips suddenly stretched into what might have been a smile, an eerie expression full of knowing intent. It then burrowed back into my head, disappearing as if it had never been there.  
I was left standing the in the empty room, my mind reeling with the horror of what had just occurred. For the first time I noticed I could feel it inside me, wriggling and squirming, making its way deeper and deeper into my body.
