*Well, it’s time to head on home now,* Rachael thought, grabbing her purchases in the check out. She was on her way out the grocery store. *The sun is still up, so I've got some time. I can be home before it’s night time.*

It was a late November evening. The sky was quiet, harbouring a few last clouds. Winter was right around the corner, and with it carried the cold. With the cold came the night, and those nights grew longer and darker. By that time, lampposts lit up the small town, with some folks huddled in a well-known fast-food joint. Others, stuck in their vehicles, glared at the traffic light. They waited for that light to go from red to green, so they could be home and be done with it all. 

And near the traffic light stood Rachael Paterson, young and tranquil. Her darkish hair flowed in the gentle wind, as the cars zoomed off to be elsewhere. She had that smile that made you think she was everyone’s best friend. Standing at the pedestrian crossing, Rachael watched and appreciated the sunset and its many hues. The magenta-shaded clouds. She imagined right there and then that when God made the world, He must have thought the sunset was one of His favourite designs. *It’s beautiful,* she considered, smiling at the sight.

Rachael waited at the traffic light with groceries in her scruffy backpack. Her zealous mother had run out of her low-priced, wholewheat bread and margarine, and she had volunteered to get some more. In truth, she used that as an excuse to buy cookies for her and her only. As cars passed by, two individuals stood beside her. A lanky, hardy cyclist and an elderly woman. The vehicles slowed down as the traffic lights turned yellow – then red.   

She turned to the elderly woman, and she was hunched and mostly reliant on the walking cane. “Excuse me, ma’am,” Rachael called with an affable tone. “Would you like some assistance crossing the road?” The woman looked back at the young girl and grinned. The wrinkled smile looked familiar to Rachael. It was like looking in the eyes of her ailing granddad.

She replied, glee on her face. “Why thank you, my dear. I could use some help. I reckon the bus is coming soon.” The walker sign blinked the same green light, and she and the other two crossed the road, passing by other people.

“I thank you,” said the old woman. “You have a kind heart, dear.”

“It’s not a problem, ma’am.”

The sun was now gone; the vibrant horizon grew weaker; the sky was all shades of blue. At the other traffic light was a bus stop; a couple of passengers waited for the assigned bus to show up. Earlier, Rachael had taken the unconventional route to get to the supermarket. Walking through the meadow, across the bridge, and down the canal behind the fast-food restaurant. She did so to buy some time so that when she got home, her mother would be fast asleep, and Reece would be God knows where.

Standing in front of the foodie establishment, the young girl explored her patched-up pocket to see if she had all her belongings. Her purse? Check. Her cards? Check. Her house-keys? …nothing? She searched her other pocket. Still nothing. Rachael checked everywhere; from her backpack to even the crevices of her pockets. On the brink of losing her cool, a thought popped into her head. She might have dropped the keys in between the aisles while distracted. “Goddamnit,” she muttered.

With haste, she returned to the supermarket, retracing her steps. She briskly walked where she remembered going through: the MRE aisle, the stationery aisle, and the bakery aisle. Making sure to inspect every nook and cranny. She searched far and wide; even lying down, checking down the aisles when no one was looking. They weren’t there. They weren’t anywhere to be seen, and Rachael could not comprehend why. 

There was a large grouping of windows at the front of the supermarket, and she saw what she had been concerned about. Darkness. The night had arrived, taking the sky and covering the land. Though she considered taking the bus home, Rachael guessed it wouldn’t arrive in the next half an hour – and she wasn’t one to wait that long. With no choice and an exasperated moan, she opted for the same route she took to get to the grocery store. 

*I’ve got to find those damn keys, otherwise I’m so, so, fucked,* the young girl thought stubbornly, as she proceeded to walk home at night. Yes, Rachael was an idiot, and it almost came at the cost of her life. 

So, she went walking down the canal at night. Rachael did not know what time it was, but she estimated it was somewhere around 6:00 pm. The cold nibbled at her ears, her nose, the tips of her nails. The premature night so dark, she barely saw the ground before her. She kicked the dried leaves and frail twigs. In search of the keys, she kicked at anything that would produce a subtle clang, and kept doing so to no avail. A few passersby came along. Another cyclist with a frail, white light passed by her, but she never asked for anyone’s help.

Fed up with finding the keys, she proposed she’d go back and search the following day. Rachael accepted the inevitable, mind-numbing lecture by her mom. But to lighten the mood, she thought of happy thoughts. In her mind, Syd Matters played Obstacles, serenading her a little. A friend of hers, Sam, suggested the song some time ago, saying it reminded him of her. Rachael never knew what to make of that, but the thought made her grateful to have friends like him. So, she hummed to the chorus and wouldn’t stop until she reached the bridge.

*How did it go again? Something about playing hide & seek in waterfalls? Probably. We were young... or something like that.*

Now, the bridge had been under construction for three years – well four years, since the idea was brought to life two months before lockdown. It was lit up on its own; emitting a kaleidoscope of colours. These blue and green and purple apparitions lit up the night. The bridge itself was steady and well-built despite Rachael’s doubts. She walked across this bridge a couple of times before and swore she could hear the creeks of the anchors. She stared down the motionless river and instinctively clutched her purse. A thought popped into Rachael’s mind, something about drowning in it, and she immediately dismissed it.  

Behind the main format of the bridge was a hill and a meadow. It was first intended to be a secluded golf course, though that got scrapped who knows how long ago. A miniature construction site was next to the peak of the hill. There was a shortcut which was closed off by the site; a beaten, old path through the woods that led to the hill. Instead, she took the gates. She had to walk through a neighbourhood she never knew the name of to do that. It was most likely the easiest thing she did that time. She reached the corroded gates.

*Here lies a path... to hell,* she thought, joking around. *‘Abandon all hope, ye who enter in.’*

The canal had been too dark to see, but the meadow was practically pitch black. So dark, the abyss itself looked tangible. Rachael questioned if she had to do this; she’d never completely gotten over her fear of the dark. Mustering up what was left of her courage, she knew this was the only way back home. There was no turning back from there. And so, she opened the gates, which let out a squeaky, metallic shriek, and headed into the field.

The sky was a black canvas with a hint of bloody red. It and earth fused to a nightmarish hellscape, and all the earthy colours the meadow had were vacuumed in the endless void. And the pale moon was set on high and at its fullest, and it had a haunting beauty that Rachael could not ignore. She watched it hung in the night sky bold and lurid. No shining star to compete against, nor heavenly body to outshine. Only it.

On a rocky path the young girl stood, and surrounding her were shadows of trees and bushes contorting silently. As she began to trudge into the open land, she beheld the large object in awe. The moon a peculiar oddity in her eyes. She felt like a shrew being stalked by a great horned owl. She continued staring at it when she noticed something. A fuzzy ring that circled it. The 22° Halo. At least that is what she heard from Sam about a few nights before.

*‘I was messing around in my backyard when I saw the damn thing,’* she remembered him explaining. *‘I could barely see it, but it was there. It looked a little unnatural. Uncanny, but kinda beautiful.’*

*‘Sounds creepy, yet interesting,’* Rachael responded. *‘What is it called?’*

*‘Some people call it the 22° Halo. I suppose it’s because it looks like a ring angels have round their heads. Others call it a moon dog, but I like the former more.’*

*‘Hmm, this sounds fascinating, I’ll say. You think I should check it out sometime?’*

*‘I reckon you should,’* Sam encouraged. *‘Although it’s not a for-sure occurrence. So, keep that in mind whenever you take a stroll at night.’* Rachael had seen throughout her teen years countless sunrises and sunsets, witnessed shooting stars and galaxies and the occasional solar eclipse. At that very moment, all those experiences paled in comparison. The 22° Halo was beautiful, Rachael knew that. But under the admiration, apprehension rose in her. 

As she kept glancing at the atmospheric phenomenon, she crept through the tall grasses. She squinted at the vague shape of a bush about 20 yards away. Every step she took made these damp, muddy squishes. Some let out a loud crunch; ice had taken form in the soil. Muddy water entered through her inner soles. Her choice of footwear were drenched. 

By then, she had reached the bush, and next to it were little pockets of white flowers. Here laid a beaten path that someone had made not too long ago. Ahead was a patch of dry grass and seed stalks that resembled wheat, and a tump where Rachael could better see part of the neighbourhood she lived in. She had about to journey to the patch until she came to a halt. 
Looking back, she saw the huge trees swaying in the breeze. Rachael sensed something, a gut feeling. She resumed her journey, but could not help looking over her shoulder. A part of her was convinced something (or someone) was out there. But on the other hand, it might be the anxiety taking its toll on her. Rachael couldn’t tell the difference, and that worried her even more.
 
She arrived at the patch and walked up the tump, and she saw the glittering lights around the neighbourhood. Rachael, a little less tense, looked over her shoulder and stared out at the field once again. She couldn’t see much, so she squinted whilst leaning forward a little. Then she saw it. Something near the pine trees at the far end. It stood out from the background as this bloodless, white speck. To Rachael, it seemed like some dog walker strolling through the field. But where are the dogs? Whatever it was, it remained in one spot just standing still. She blinked a couple of times, further narrowing her eyes. And as she peered to that side of the meadow once more, she couldn’t spot it anymore. It wasn’t there. Though the figure was so vague that she wondered if it was ever there. It might have been a trick of the mind. Either way, she did not risk finding out; thus, she picked up speed.  

She believed she was hallucinating; all the spooky stories were getting to her head, and she reckoned they’re making her see things that are not there. However, she noticed her clammy hands trembled in the quiet, frigid air. Rachael glanced back and forth, squinting over the meadow just to see that white spot. She would occasionally see familiar speckle appear a bit closer than the last. She wore a cross necklace she used as a gimmicky crucifix; whilst clinging onto it, she recited in her heart scriptures of protection. Verses like Psalms 23 and Psalms 91 and Psalms 121. *‘You should use these prayers to chase out the heebie-jeebies,’* her mother told. As Rachael repeated the verses verbatim, she felt at ease at that moment. Still, that doubt lingered, and she could not extinguish it, no matter how many times she murmured, *‘The Lord is my shepherd.’*

Muttering prayers, she descended the tump, briskly striding through the path. She would arrive at a slope alongside a leafless thicket. The naked trees swayed in the rush of wind like a spirit-driven folk dance. There, she could make out the outline of a rusty fence and a couple outworn duplexes beyond that. Letting out an exhale of relief, Rachael cautiously came down the slippery incline. As she got halfway down the incline, she heard some rattling in the woods. Steps… lots of them. She couldn’t move, she did not want to. Her arms were like gooseflesh. She just knew she was not alone. Her hearing heightened, and with it she heard various things around it. Nothing happened for a while. 

*Maybe it’s one of those deer passing by,* she reckoned. Rachael did not know, but then she heard something else. A swift blow behind her until everything settled and complete silence took over. Then came a feeling of something behind her. Rachael did not want to, but she looked behind her. Before she could do so, she suddenly felt a strong strike on the small of her back.  

Knocked out of balance, she went tumbling down the soiled slope, landing on a bed of dry grass and twigs. Upon landing, she bashed her head on some thick tree branch, rendering her momentarily dazed. It was not long before Rachael had gotten her bearings and saw her bag destroyed, spewing out a few slices of bread in a newly ripped hole. She noticed something running down her cheek, and when she inspected it, it smelled like iron with a bit of earth. She heard it again; some wet footsteps that sounded like it was coming at her fast.  

“Nope!”, she shouted in an alert tone, gathering her things quickly in the mud-caked backpack. 
 
The girl arose when she felt a lightning bolt of pain in her left ankle. She tried bearing weight on it, but the pain was too unbearable. Like a stray, rabid dog gnawing at her ankle to the bone. As she clutched her bag, she hobbled to the path that led her home. There was another steep rise closer to the canal, and further to an opening of a dead end. But with that in mind, Rachael was in severe agony.

Resuming her excruciating hike, the wind picked up, blowing at her and causing the streaming liquid to get in her eye. The current was so strong, it made the disoriented Rachael fall on her ass. Moaning and whimpering, she lied on the mud. She heard it again; more of the same sounds. They surrounded her. Footsteps in the mud. Movement within the woods. Something flew by faster than her eyes could see. 

The moon was in her view once more, and it had an eerie shine. The white sphere contrasting with the inky sky looked hypnotic. And that pale ring – that halo, suddenly became two. Then four, and half a dozen, and many more. Rings within rings that grew brighter, circling the moon like an illusion spiral. A beautiful, yet menacing sight to behold. In all the trepidation Rachael, she sensed her consciousness slipping away while looking at the halos. She felt like she was being put to sleep, though not in a relaxing way. As she was about to lose grip of her consciousness, a loud beep from a car snapped her out of the trance.  

As soon as she got back up again, the current picked up once more. Rachael, in excruciating pain, continued her perilous journey, despite the wind seemingly working against her. She limped. Her damaged ankle buckled under her weight. She limped. The wind blew at her as though it itself had a mind of its own. Like a primordial god of the element heaving her with its heavy, invisible hands.  

“Fuck,” Rachael hissed under her voice as she felt that sharp pain at the side of her foot. She had her muddy feet stuck film to the earth as though anchoring them.

Atop the incline, she heard something moving towards her. The wind had stopped then, and Rachael seized that opportunity to get on top of the slope. She knew that whatever was pursuing her wasn’t going to stop. So, she staggered through the rocky path, wincing. There was a florescent lamppost at the end of the stony path; said to be the oldest lamppost in the neighbourhood. Salvation was a couple steps away. She was so close, but her useless, fucking leg kept dragging her behind. Every step she took, she teared up. She felt the agony. That doom drawing near. That dread. 

*I’m gonna die,* she told herself. *I’m gonna die!*

Rachael moved as quickly as her limp could let her. She winced over the pain but knew if she stopped, she would face a fate worse than that. Clarity came into her mind; she was near the asphalt dead end. The lamppost visible from where she was at. Just one more step. Just one more... 

It wasn’t long until she found herself out the pathway. She made it. Reaching heaven in the form of a bygone lamppost. As she shambled to the checkpoint, Rachael dropped beneath the ancient light, sitting up against the wooden barricade. She checked for her belongings for the final time, with her wallet intact and most of the wholewheat bread in place. 

Rachael gathered all her things when she heard leaves rattling from the darkness of the path. Something caught the soft glow of the lamppost. The young girl acknowledged it quickly and froze. She saw what looked like eyes staring back at her with no expression, but the longer she stared, she noticed they were lights. Fiery, white lights that grew in brightness.

Then out the darkness protruded two floating strands of pure white linen slowly outstretched like murderous hands. They were long; stretching about 16 meters and more. But then came more of the slender wraps, worming their way to Rachael. And more came, possibly in the hundreds the girl guessed. So many, to Rachael, all she saw was white. They were so close to each other; they looked like one massive fabric covering part of the sky and land.

“What the fuck?”, she murmured as she desperately tried to crawl away. However, to her surprise, none of them came close to her. Whenever they proceeded to, they seemed to flinch like something was blocking them.

Then all the strands retracted swiftly and she saw it. The thing hovering over the uncut, wet grass. It was dressed in all white; its body was a long, linen fabric that draped from whatever it hung to. Its head was a large bovine skull with two large eye sockets, and in them were blinding orbs resembling eyes. Rachael saw those elongated strands pull in back to its bottom. It was unlike anything she had ever seen or heard of. Any form of comprehension she had seeped through her mind as she cowered before the living nightmare. Terror was written on her face; her breath grew shallow and discomposed. 

The fiend towered over the path, eclipsing the moon. The confused Rachael saw it creepily bend over and scrutinize her, sending trepidation down her soul. It was then the girl saw a circular beam around its horns. A halo, matching perfectly with the moon. A terrible thought occurred to her of what this all meant. Hesitant as she was, Rachael dared to speak to it. She rose up her cross necklace in defence, and proposed the question.

“Are you... are you an angel?” 

The fiend never responded. It never let out a groan or some abominable shriek. She inched backward a little more, only noticing it was not pursuing her anymore. She never knew as to why it didn’t, perhaps she never will. 

Then she saw the fiend descended gracefully, and as it kept its glower on Rachael, it retreated to the field – or whatever hell it came out of. Its halo dimmed slowly and did so until Rachael could not make out the simple shape of it. The eyes were still there, watching her even when it submerged into the darkness. And before she knew it, it was gone. She found it nearly impossible to believe that she was left alive. After all the torment she went through, Rachael got to live to see another day. 

Without hesitation, she got her things and dashed away from the place. She shambled, shrugging off the twinge. Home was around the corner; she thought she could check how bad her ankle was then. But now, she needed to get away from whatever monstrosity she saw. It wasn’t until she reached halfway that Rachael felt worn out. Fighting the urge not to falter, she staggered until her knees tightened like rusted door hinges. She made it to the stairs, tripping over a few steps, but managing. And in no time, she arrived in the comfort of her doorstep. From there, she rang the bell and did not stop until she heard a familiar, baritone voice. 

“I’m coming goddamnit!” Rachael stood on one leg, waiting for the door to be unlocked. A few seconds passed and it did, revealing a stout man with a vexed look in his strained, veiny eyes. His hoodie reeked of long nights with cigarettes and energy drinks; he was holding an opened Red Bull. This was Reece, and despite their feuds, Rachael could not have been gladder to see his grumpy face. 

Reece noticed how much of a mess his sister was; from the dried-up blood glistening on her cheek to the mud everywhere on her body. He eyed her up and down once and saw her balancing on one leg. “You look like you went mud wrestling with Kurt Angle,” he commented jokingly. “Did you have fun?” 

Rachael scowled at him, waiting to get inside. “Yes actually. I did have fun getting ankle locked in mud.” 

“Right. Seriously though, what happened to you?” 

“I tripped.” 

“You... tripped?” Reece questioned, looking unconvinced. 

“Yes, Reece, I tripped. I tripped and I fell and got muddied up.” 

“Well, that’s one long fall you had.” 

“…yeah.” Rachael could not tell him what happened, as she feared she would sound insane. All he did was raise one eyebrow. “Just let me in, alright?!” 

“Fine!” Reece opened the door wider and helped Rachael with her belongings. As her brother locked the door behind, Rachael inspected her ankle and felt it had swollen a lot. “I don’t wanna know,” he said. “I don’t even wanna know what you got up to at this time.”

“Fine; it’s not like you want to know. Where’s mom?”, she asked, wincing when she twisted her bad ankle by accident. 

“In bed,” he gave a short answer. He was gone for a little while and came back with a cold can of cream soda. “Rachael!” 

She looked up at Reece as he approached her. The mad lad tossed the soda pop at her; she caught it with little effort. She set it aside and began to untie her soaked shoes and tossed her socks to the side. It was swollen, and some discolouration ran down the outside of her foot.  

“And before you say anything; no, I won’t tell mom you came home late,” Reece thought to clarify. Rachael nodded in appreciation. 

“Wait, what about my foot?”

“Just tell her you fell or something, I don’t know. Tell her it was a big fall. I’ll get the bath ready. You’re gonna need it... you know... because you look like shit – literally.” 

“Thanks a lot... muppet,” Rachael replied. 

“You’re welcome, ya muppet,” he said. With that, Reece left somewhere, and Rachael limped down the corridor, disgruntled after her treacherous journey. There, she heard her mother snoring and the TV playing. An American televangelist teaching sermons and prayers. Standing there in pain, she heard the geyser turned on, as well as a rush of water in a bath.

“Make sure to use that bath soak I like,” she advised Reece.

“I know.”

“And don’t make it too hot!”

“I **know**, Rachael.”

The fear within Rachael calmed. She took in a few, deep breaths, and had some clarity. She was safe. Everyone was safe. Suddenly she remembered the house keys she had ‘lost.’ She turned back and glanced at a hanger on the wall. It was then she realised she nearly got herself killed for nothing. 

She never lost the keys. Never even had them to begin with as a matter of fact. She must have thought all along that she had them when they were hanging on the wall the whole time. She believed if it had not been for her forgetfulness, she would have gotten home safe and sound. It did not matter anymore. She still lives. Though she lives now with a haunted memory of a fiend that lurks in the woods. A malevolent being of the pale moon ring. She will never forget the night she stumbled across the 22° Angel.
