Whatever you do, don't go to Greece if you want to celebrate New Year's Eve. If you do, it'll be the last time anybody sees you. I know you'll say something like that it'll be fun to go there and explore the ruins and learn the culture and shit. Believe me though, it's for your own safety, just stay at home with the heater on and watch the ball drop at Times Square in New York City with your families. It's been a year since it happened, when I was fighting for my life from the claws of soul-sucking flesh eating monsters that were once known as the Olympians, and if it wasn't for Medusa, I definitely wouldn't be here today to tell you my story.

For starters, my name is Frank Patterson.

My story began last year  with me having a conversation with my parents regarding this vacation in their living room at the house on a Thursday night after dinner. It was a long one.

"So let me get this right, you want to celebrate New Year's Eve in Greece with your girlfriend Helena and your friends Nick and Jack?" my father asked.

"Yes." I replied, "The flight is gonna be early on Friday morning."

"What's wrong with just celebrating it here Frank?" my mom asked.

"Mom, I want to reign in the new year in a different country. I know how we Americans celebrate New Year's Eve, I want to see what it's like over in another country." I told her.

Dad reached to scratch the back of his head. He looked deep in thought.

"Yeah, reigning in the new year by having sex with my girlfriend and boozing it up!" my sister teased standing in the dark hallway.

I let out a huge sigh and rubbed my right hand over my face for a moment. I had gotten drunk and went to jail for it about eighteen months ago, but I have no intention of doing that shit while vacationing in Greece. I turned and gave my sister Cynthia the finger. She let out a soft chuckle as she walked back to her bedroom. My mom narrowed her eyes at me for doing that. Dad was still in thought. 

"Well. if that's what you wanna do son," Dad said, "We just want you to be safe, ya know how much we worry about you Frank." 

After talking for a bit more, we began packing for the four day trip. Clothes, books, bathroom supplies, and a few other things. I had a hard time sleeping due to how anxious I was about having my own trip to another country. My parents and sister woke my ass up and dropped me off at the airport where I met up with my girlfriend, Nick, and Jack. Helena was looking drop dead gorgeous. I don't know what makeup she'd put on this time, but it definitely was starting to draw some extra attention. All four of us quickly went through security and boarded the Boeing 747 outside. The flight itself wasn't that bad, other than the few who got airsick, and some unruly asshole passengers. After eating some snacks and sipping a cold soda, I fell into a deep sleep.

"Hey Dickhead wake up!" yelled Nick. Jolting me awake from my sleep.

"What?" I asked groggily.

"We're here." Helena told me.

"After fourteen fucking hours!" exclaimed Jack, with a hint of frustration in his voice. 

I yawned and stretched out my arms, then looked at the windows to see the city lights of Greece and a twilight blue night sky as the plane was slowing down on the runway of Athens Airport. The plane slowed to a stop at our terminal, and we entered the airport. Unlike the one in Atlanta, this airport wasn't as busy or crowded. Though it took a while to get out. We took a cab to our hotel, The Wyndham Grand Athen. We got into our rooms and unpacked some of our stuff. Helena and I shared one room while Nick and Jack shared the one next to us. After settling down for an hour or so, I looked out the window overlooking the city, and I saw an ancient temple looming on a hill in the distance. Someone knocked on the door, and I answered.

"Yo Frank, do you wanna go out and have a few drinks?" Nick asks. Jack's standing next to him.

Helena and I looked at each other for a moment. "No, I promised my parents that I wasn't going to drink anything involving alcohol due to my record."

"Suit yourself." Jack said.

The next day, Saturday, we toured around the city. I'm not good with the Greek language, so my girlfriend  translated for me as we went to different places. We eventually went to the Byzantine and Christian Museum and looked around at some of the artifacts and Christian influence on Greek culture. We talked for a bit regarding the violent history of Christianity and it felt nice to have someone from halfway across the world to agree with me on religion. After looking around the museum for half an hour, a man came from nowhere and tackled Helena to the hard floor and attempted to stab her with a knife while screaming something in Greek. I quickly ran to her and ripped the man off her. Both he and I struggled on the floor for a bit and I saw Helena get up and run asking for help.

As the man and I continued wrestling on the floor, I managed to knock the knife out of his hand.  The guy then got the upper hand and subdued me, he carefully looked into my eyes, and even though he held both my arms to the floor, he looked like he was trying to tell me something.I tried to move, but this man's grip was pretty strong. He then looked into the direction my girlfriend left before turning  back to face  me. He told me something in Greek, it sounded like 'Medusa' but I'm not quite sure. It wasn't that long before I heard other people running towards us shouting in Greek. It was the police.

The police  yanked the man off me, arrested him, and put him into a patrol car outside. I immediately walked to Helena and hugged her.

"Thanks for getting the police  sweetheart." I thanked her.

One of the cops came up to us, and this cop, a middle aged man, did speak english. "How are you two doing?" he asked.

"As good as expected." We said in unison, turning to face him.

"You know, this is the eighteenth time this year alone that someone had attacked or tried to kill you Helena. Is there something we should know about?" he asked focusing on Helena.

"No officer there isn't." Helena replied.

The officer then left to join his partner in his patrol car and they drove off. The people watching from across the street went back to their daily routines. Eighteen times? What are the odds of anyone being physically attacked that many times within a year? I know back in the US, people are given death threats on social media for absurd reasons, but usually those kinds of things are dealt with very easily or turn out to be empty. I've been in at least three fights myself, twice in high school, and the one that landed me in jail almost two years ago. But one person being attacked 18 times means that either that person has gotten too deep with dangerous people or something else is going on. I gave my girlfriend a questioning look, and as if she'd read my thoughts.

"We'll talk about this later. Right now I want to visit another place before leaving. We still have a whole day left." She told me. 

We left the museum and headed over to a few places before heading back to our hotel room. My friends Nick and Jack had not come back yet from touring the sites. They'd visited Greece a few times before and knew their way around places more than I did. I needed Helena to guide me. The rest of the day passed by and before I knew it, it was nighttime again. Helena was sitting on her bed watching the TV silently. Yet as I lay on my bed watching TV with her, the thought of her being attacked was stuck in my mind. Most importantly, is the fact that it all happened during the whole ten months we've dated and she'd never mentioned any of it. But before I could ask her, she spoke first.

"I'm going to get something to eat downstairs, do you want anything?" she asked.

"Mmm... Yeah." I replied, turning my face to meet hers, "But first we need to talk about something-"

"Yeah I know about the repeated attacks I've suffered this year. I'll tell you more about it after dinner okay?" She interrupted. 

Helena then got up, grabbed her purse, and left the room, closing the door behind her. I turned back to the TV. I heard the door to the next room open and close followed by muffled talking. Nick and Jack had come back and I was planning on talking to them for a bit before they went to sleep. Sadly, I never got the chance.

I woke up after having dozed off for a certain amount of time. Helena wasn't back yet. I jumped from the bed  and searched the room before checking the hall. She wasn't there. I figured that maybe she's still in the restaurant area and so I went downstairs. I'd asked around but no one had seen my girlfriend. I decided to check on Nick and Jack if they'd seen or talked with her.

Knocking on the door, "Yo are you shitheads still awake?" I asked.

No answer. I knocked again before realizing the door was slightly ajar. I started to feel a cold chill run down my spine as I opened the door. What I saw made me freeze in ice cold terror. Nick was sprawled out on his bed, with his face gone, skull exposed, arms and legs almost completely eaten, chest and stomach completely ripped open with the inner organs on the bed half eaten, and his feet exposed. An eye was looking at me on the bed. Fresh blood covered all over the bed, walls, and even the lamp. My mouth dropped. I saw Jack on the floor next to the TV, his body in a similar state, and blood completely soaked the floor and covered the dresser next to him. There was even blood smeared on the windows as well as bloody spots leading to the door.

I backed up a bit, placing my hand over my mouth before vomiting in the doorway. I turned away and backed up against the wall still in shock. My heart was beating hard and fast in my chest. I shut my eyes  in an attempt to erase the horrible sight from my mind. My arms and hands started to feel numb followed by a slight tingle like what happens if you'd slept on your arm for a long period of time. 

"No no no no no." I repeated to myself. 

I don't know how long I kept standing against the wall outside the room with my eyes closed, but it wasn't long before I felt someone tapping me on my right shoulder.
