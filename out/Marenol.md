I've been keeping a daily dream diary for as long as I can remember. People say it can help you distinguish dreams from reality or that it might blur the lines between the two, but for me, it's neither. Some call it a form of psychotherapy, but then again, anything done with dedication could be labeled as such. For me, it's just fun. Rereading my entries makes me feel like I have more memories from the past. Dreams and memories, once past, are almost indistinguishable, both becoming events that happened.

Yet, capturing dreams on paper is no small feat. Dreams vanish from memory swiftly. Even as I write, details slip away like sand through fingers. I strive for brevity. Professional interviewers use unique symbols instead of words—something I can't manage. Consequently, my dream diary is riddled with mistakes. Accurate note-taking is a Herculean task.

Lately, my dreams have turned into vivid nightmares. They feel so real. Often, I die in these dreams, and sometimes I endure endless suffering without the release of death. Upon waking, the pain and fear remain fresh, the sensations so lifelike that sleep has become a dreaded ordeal. Each night feels like a brush with death. Yet, I persist with my diary, perhaps because each waking resets the torment. Maybe one day, it won't.

There's only one culprit I can think of for this surge in nightmares: Marenol tablets.

These tablets weren't prescribed. I bought them myself. I'm depressed. Hospital-prescribed meds failed me, and counseling never earned my trust. I stopped taking my prescribed meds and withdrew from the world, each step outside my room a monumental challenge. I stopped eating, collapsed, vomited even when there was nothing left to expel.

Desperation led me to the internet, where a certain antidepressant caught my eye. I was researching suicide methods—without real intent—when I stumbled upon it on a morbidly helpful page. Marenol promised significant antidepressant effects, mood elevation, and nutritional adjustment. Its side effects? "Severe nightmares that can lead to death." Suspiciously enticing, its main effect recovery, its side effect death—ideal for someone contemplating suicide. I found the prospect of nightmare-induced death almost... amusing. So, I took it, not bothering to read the dosage carefully, as I've overdosed on meds before.

In hindsight, it's clear Meanol was meant for those ready to embrace death. Its nightmares are hellish, each death within as agonizing as in reality. Pills make suicide painful, a fact I foolishly tested. Ironic, isn't it? I wanted to die, but not suffer. Yet these pills have trapped me, making me feel good when awake, filling me with energy and false cheer.

This is the trap: the pills' primary effect is death, their side effects a cruel simulation of life. Dying in a dream might seem trivial, but the pain feels real. Rumors suggest that dreams can shock the brain to death if too intense. Perhaps that's why I wake each time, still alive but carrying the agony of dream deaths.

It's bewildering how I'm still alive. The pain from spears piercing my body, being crushed, drowning—it's all too real, even if it's just in dreams. Now, I endure, waiting for the effects to wear off. It's been days, but there's no end in sight. I'll continue dying nightly until it's over. This is my self-inflicted punishment.

Should I die in reality, my body will bear no scars. My real diary and dream diary, however, reveal the truth of my torment. Each entry a testament to my suffering, a chronicle of my nightly deaths. Good night.
