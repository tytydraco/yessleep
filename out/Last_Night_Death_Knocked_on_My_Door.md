I am writing this because I know I am going to die in a few minutes.

I go out to throw away the trash. Likewise, I want to go back to the series. The front door won't budge. My house is old, and the door is large and heavy. The trash drips onto the floor.

Time stands still. Then I see him: a dark foot, still as a tombstone, blocking my way out. I think I'm going to be mugged.

It's a man in black. Long coat, high collar, top hat.

He shouldn't be there. He won't let me out.

I want to ask him to let me open the door, but the words won't come out. I look into his eyes, and I get even more scared. They are round, intensely black. Two unfathomable wells that trap me hopelessly.

He looks like a raven. No, worse: he looks like something that shouldn't be alive. I freeze.

He speaks and says to me:

“I've come to get you because today you're going to die.”

His voice has a strange echo.

Then he disappears, and the door opens as if it were made of paper. There's no one there! He's vanished. I rub my eyes,

Panicked, I drop the trash bag, turn around, and run up the stairs. My heart is beating like a drum, and sweat is pouring down my back.

When I reach my door, my hands are shaking so much that I can't get the key into the lock. Finally, I open it, close it, and lock all the bolts.

“Calm down,” I tell myself, “it's a hallucination.”

But then I remember when I was little and my grandfather died. Before he died, he told me that a Man in Black had come to find him and announced his death. He died that same day.

Then fear overwhelms me again. I find it difficult to breathe.

I decide to go to the living room. I pour myself a whiskey. I drink it in one gulp. The whiskey glass slips from my hands.

Suddenly, the lights go out, and I'm left in the dark. It's terrifying! Why does the power have to go out right now, just like in horror movies?

I go to the kitchen and flip the main switch on the light panel several times. It's useless; there's no way to turn it back on. The darkness stares at me. I feel it.

I stand there, petrified, while the darkness whispers in my ear with icy breath.

The silence suffocates me. I can't see anything.

I think the Man in Black has entered my house.

There he is, motionless and silent, staring at me from the end of the hallway. I don't know how he got in, but I understand everything when he starts moving towards me.

It's death!

I rush to my bedroom. I close the door and put the chair in front of it so he can't get in.

If I close my eyes, maybe all this will disappear. But I know that's not the case. He's there, waiting...

Why me? What have I done to deserve this?

I'm not special. But he has come.

That's why I'm starting to write this message on my cell phone. I know I'm going to die! I'm sure of it.

Furthermore, I believe in life after death. Is this the moment? And as I write this, I know that I'm no longer doing it to save myself... If anyone reads this, know that it's real.

Ah. Now he's behind me. I don't know how he got in. There are no locks, no walls, no time to stop him.

He's here. He's here, and he says to me:

“Hit send. Because you're going to die...”
