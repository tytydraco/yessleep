I was going on another excursion to my wooden-boarded haunt, there had never really been a choice at all. It was early November back then, and the late night air blew chilly, chapping the skin of my face and hands. I didn't care. All I wanted was another look at it. The House was waiting for me, so serene against the backdrop of the woods in the distance, with its knotted fingers of elm tree and birch reaching crookedly up toward the sky.

There were no clouds that night. I remember because I kept glancing up at all the constellations I knew, the stars that make up Ursa Minor leading me on my way like foreboding points of candlelight on black velvet. My due North, when I had none inside of me.

The House was as it was as always; a too-bright artefact in the night, something exhumed and proclaimed holy by a superstitious mind, like Stonehenge or a small pyramid in the desert of suburbia.

I think that, just for a moment as it first came into view, I felt a strange sense of longing. 

Of love, the way you love poisonous things that hurt you but apologize after, something that sinks its claws into you while making you feel cherished all the while. And then, as suddenly as it had come, the feeling passed, and it was just a house again, no one's home but a pile of wood and concrete. My feet found their way up the road toward it on their own accord. I wanted to go back to my apartment, where there was warmth and some soup in the fridge to eat, but they were not in agreement with me. 

This time, my figure was waiting for me. 

Not only that, but it was outside. Next to the little shed, in the backyard of the House, the figure stood unnaturally still as only something from another reality could. Not a single hair blown here nor there by the wind, not a twitch of its thin, sharp limbs. It just stood there, absorbing all light like a long, dark tunnel leading nowhere, the kind that feels almost creepy to pass through on a highway stretch.

 

As I approached, I was hit by that strange feeling again, prickling the back of my neck, telling me I was doing something stupid. I had to agree with enthusiasm. I felt watched, picked apart, dissected by this creature's pitch black, blank eyes. They glowed the faintest ember in the dim starlight, unsettling like a pair of blood moons, and it made me want to snuff them out somehow. They followed me as I came closer, squinting in the dark. 

It stood by a swingset, one I’d never seen before; a basic, rusty construction with two seats that looked uncomfortable just to look at. It made me think of the ones I’d had as a child in the crappy neighborhood I’d grown up in, another children’s drawing approximation of something that could actually be used. I stood there for a while, and the figure didn’t move until my phone started vibrating, my friend calling me this time, and once I’d fumbled my phone off, it was gone. I looked up and saw nothing, like it had never been there at all. It wasn’t a very eventful meeting. What scared me most was the air of expectation around the thing, as if it had been waiting for me for a while.

What scared me most was the notion that I had been about to sit down on one of those swings had we not been interrupted. The recognition in its holes-for-eyes.

During the next couple of days, I kept on taking excursions to the House. Every time I told myself I'd stop, that I had better things to do, something profoundly creepy would happen, some bad omen or other that brought me right back to the cursed place like a moth to flame.

Once, I saw nothing, nothing but a cat crossing the road, over to the eerie construction lot on the other side, but it was a strange approximation of such a creature that it stopped me dead in my tracks. The cat was sleek, sharp, and moved with animatronic precision, and I know that makes it sound like any other feline, but I swear this one seemed to be even more aware of its surroundings than other cats I knew of. It moved with the utmost of nonchalant indifference, yet I could tell its eyes were fixated on me as it made its fast track to the scrapheap down the road, and I got this weird feeling that it wanted me to follow. I didn't, because I know the rules of horror pretty well and following that little demon underneath a sheet of metal was not on the list of survivor moves, but... but I kind of wanted to. I had some feeling that my fate would be decided there in the dark, and the morbid curiosity I felt made me feel almost feverish with it.

Later, I would think back on the time I saw a cat cross a road and laugh about it. How terrifying, I would chuckle. What would I even call the incident to convey the true horror of it? 'The Curious Case of the Fast-Moving Cat'? It was all nonsense. Still, it scared me off for a few days after that one. It was the closest to something living I had come across at that place.

Something else would happen as soon as I plucked up the courage to go back there, and live inside my head for ages as I turned it over, trying to make sense of it.

There is a shed behind the House.

Rather, sometimes there is a shed.

When I first discovered it, there was nothing but the manicured lawn behind it, stretching far beyond its fenced off borders, flowerless and almost neon green. The third time I passed, a small shed sat off to the side, looking old and worn as if it had been there for aeons.

It was the same unassuming, white color as the House, only much more weathered and fraying. It looked at me with its' one window like an eye, just like that cat, observing me as I passed, open and lid-less.

It was just one large square window, turned on its side, the corners pointed like a star. There was no door. Nothing through which you could enter into the black hole inside, no doubt waiting to swallow you whole. I shivered as I passed it.

I knew that it was staring right at me, following me with its one sole access to vision, and what is it they say about abysses? I kept my gaze resolutely on the ground in front of me, ignoring the same old feeling of being studied – by a shed of all things – even though that familiar feeling of paranoia festered inside of me like a wound. I had never felt so seen, and just like the figure in the window, the shed made me afraid to be trapped somehow. I knew, despite the fact that there seemed to be no entrance into it, as soon as I stepped foot inside, that would be it. No going back from the decision to enter what was surely another realm, a hellscape beyond even my imagination.

I had this thought that it was beyond it because there was nothing to imagine, that the stark lack of assault to my senses would be worse than any horror I could come up with. Imagine being trapped forever in nothing. It made me sick with fear.

I've seen that shed pop in and out of existence since. Sometimes it's behind the House, hiding somewhere off to the side, sometimes in front of it, sometimes it's nowhere to be found. Those times worry me the most. Whatever it's up to, I can't imagine that it's doing any good.

I had honestly lost my mind a little at this point. Sometimes I swore I saw shadows running across the lawn, once I saw a vaguely humanoid shadow scale the wall and disappear before my open eyes. Once I saw…

Well. You wouldn’t believe me. 

And always, always that sense of ‘something bad happened here’ tightening my chest as I walk by.

I’m here to write about the last time I ever went to that place, for the most part. It was one of those moments you can’t forget, can’t get rid of, that reshapes your life in some strange way that’s unavoidable, like it was always leading toward that point.

The shape didn’t move. I raised my other hand, gave that silly little wave I hadn’t last time, wondering if it would copy me as I did. It just stayed perfectly still, watching, blank.

And a thought came into my head, that feels weird to describe, because it doesn’t make sense now as I type it, as I think it over in my head again. I remember thinking:

“Oh, she doesn’t see me.”

I don't know why I thought of it as ‘she’. Here, in the comfort of my home, here in the after, I only think of the shape as ‘it’. Then, however, it was a ‘she’, and I knew for certain that if I just got a little closer to her, she would be able to see me better, and so I took another step, all the way up to the gate again. and reached my hand through the bars this time,like all the way from the floor above she would be able to take my hand somehow. Reaching up like a child, palm open, to be picked up and maybe held. My fingers felt a little colder in the chilly air on the other side of the gate.

It still didn’t move, and it still didn’t seem to see me, so I thought: ‘I just need to get closer.’

Again, fucking stupid. I can't explain to you where it came from, like some wayward rat had snuck inside my head and was chewing on the wires in my brain, a thought that was both mine and wasn’t mine at all.

Acting on this unknown urge, I pushed open the gate door that wasn’t locked, and I walked into the yard.

The path seemed to weirdly narrow in front of me, like it wasn’t just a five meter little walkway dividing the street and the House, like all of a sudden it had width and breadth that it hadn’t just a moment ago, and I swear I walked it for a full minute and I still hadn’t reached the porch, the figure in the window in my sight the entire time. Following my path. Guiding me, like a lighthouse.

And all around me, it was strange and beautiful. Here, the sky seemed clearer somehow, packed with more stars than outside, like there were extra constellations in the sky that I had never seen before. The moon was brighter, fuller – a perfectly round disc of silver in the sky, bathing everything a pale gray. The house shone in it. Its perfect white color reminded me of clean bone, the picked apart carcass of a whale on the bottom of the deepest places in the sea, after all the creatures that live down there have had their fill. A melancholy sight, almost. A little lonely, perhaps.

Beautiful, still, it’s perfect arches and perfectly straight pillars holding up the roof, which in turn was holding up the sky, and the stars twinkled and the figure watching over me was still.

I felt so at peace.

For the first time in forever, for the first time ever maybe, the normally rushing thoughts in my head that roiled and churned were just quiet. Still, like the figure in the window, stilled by this odd architecture and its perfect symmetry. Every blade of grass was a perfect line, like nature never otherwise seems to accomplish, and on them little droplets reflected the moonlight like glass, like pearls of moisture on a spider’s web. It hadn’t been raining. it was too early for dew. the trees were moving, caught in some wind I couldn't feel myself, and they seemed to be swaying, like dancers, rhythmic and giddy. chattering, like a crowd at a concert, right before the act shows up, all loud, excited whispers that bleed together to one loud hiss. Ready for the show.

I kept on, and after a time long enough for me to wonder if I would ever reach the House, I was suddenly at the porch. The porch had been far away, the porch was now at my feet. I stopped for a second. I hesitated, frowning at it, some trace of normalcy kicking back into me. 

‘This isn’t right,” I remember thinking, feeling that car sickness you get when the world in your eyesight doesn’t line up with what your inner ear is feeling, when everything is a too-fast moving blur of unfamiliar shapes. I remember thinking, ‘this doesn’t make any sense.’ 

They say just keep your eyes forward, when you feel like that, look straight ahead and focus on the horizon. Some fixed point ahead, and the nausea will get better. So I raised my head again, up toward the window, up to the figure, who must be able to see me better now.

It didn’t move. It still didn’t react. In fact it didn’t seem to care about me at all, and for some reason I really wanted it to, I needed it to, so I took one slightly wobbly step toward the little stairs, the gravel crunching underneath my boot.

A noise so loud it rang in my ears pierced the serene quiet. My hands flew toward my ears for some reason, hiding away from it, confused. Looking around for the source in panic.

The figure in the window slammed its fist against the glass, so hard it rattled the wooden frame. The first and only real confirmation that it was a person, although of course it was a person, i knew it was, all along i knew, and its white fists pressed against the glass for a second and were gone again. They left no mark.

I should have left, then. If there was any concept of ‘leaving’ still in my head, I would have. I can’t explain it but my mind had shrunk somehow, rooms that had been open and leading into other rooms were shut, locked, and only simple and oddly connecting thoughts were left.

‘She needs help,’ I thought. ‘She’s in trouble. She needs my help.’

It felt so right, that thought. somehow, it still feels right, but everything around it was just a blur, dysfunctional, broken apart. I swear, it felt like that one time my friend and I took an acid trip from hell in the back of her dad’s volvo, and it took us both an hour to figure out how to open the door. like that, but less pleasant. More pleasant. It’s hard to say.

The woman in the window needed my help, and I was right there, and who was going to stop me? The door was open. I knew the door would be open, I just did, and no one could even see me here, standing in the dark at the end of the street. Why would they even try?

‘Don’t worry,’ I thought to the shape in the window, ‘don’t worry, I'm coming,’ and I took a step up the porch stairs, and then another, and then the last. I was on the porch, and I couldn't see the window anymore but I could hear another bang, even louder than before. It made me stop in my tracks for a moment, but only a moment. Then I was at the door, and I realized that i needed to hurry or she might not make it, and i can’t tell you what it was i thought she wouldn’t make it from, but alarms were going off in my head and i needed to get inside. I should get inside. I was invited, wanted, the inside was waiting for me.

Another bang, and this time, a scream.

A bloodcurdling thing, booming noise, a scream so loud it should have woken up the whole street, should have brought out at least one nosy neighbor to investigate, maybe call the police. 

There was no street here. There was nothing here, and everything that had been was far off now. Too far to hear or see.

I needed to get inside.

With every step I took that figure in the window banged, and yelled, and if there were words to it they were unknowable, undistinguishable, muffled, like when you yell underwater and all that’s coming out is bubbles, reaching the surface with nothing inside. Empty. Hollow. Void of meaning.

Still it kept screaming, until i was at the door, and my hand was almost on the handle, was on the handle, and I wanted to leave. I needed to get inside.

Once again I leaned my head back, and through an angle not possible saw the creature right above me. Saw nothing but it, nothing but its blank face and that hair, long and black. Long like my mother's, the way I remember it on those rare days in the summer when she would let it out of her normally tight bun, when she would laugh and seem at ease in her own sharp way, never fully but a decent enough facsimile, and it would shine in the sun and I thought she was so beautiful, that I wanted to be like her when I grew up, that I never could because I was something small and dirty and unwanted – because she told me so – but she would smile then, and I knew she loved me, or the closest she had ever really gotten to that feeling.

For some reason, at that moment, I missed her. 

It was a split second thought, an incoherent echo from somewhere deep inside of me I never feel anymore, somewhere small and desperate and helpless, somewhere I thought was long gone and dead, like her. That died with her, and I was glad that it had, and I was glad she was dead, so glad that it was finally over, and I never thought about any if that because how the fuck do you, how do you have a conversation about things like that even with yourself, those deep dark things that never see daylight, that are pushed beneath shopping lists and buss tables and conversations with people you don't care about, about anything, anything at all that isnt that. 

For a moment I was small again, I regressed years and years and became that girl from so long ago, or maybe someone else entirely, someone who saw clearer than I do and the world seemed huge and strange and utterly terrifying, something with razor sharp teeth and blurry edges, like an old photograph taken in bad lighting you took home from the developer's and stared at, confused, trying to make sense of what you knew were familiar things you yourself had tried to capture, happy moments, that now didn't make sense to you at all, just pitch black and pinpricks of light, and all I saw was black and pins of light, and I knew that they were stars and I didn’t know, and I didnt understand, and I missed my mother, and tried to see but I couldnt, the world was upside down, everything before was everything behind, and the ground had opened up into the sky, and all things were eternal and there was screaming, only screaming and I didnt know if it was the thing in the window or me, and I could taste tears like an ocean on my tongue, and all around me were branches of trees that werent trees but a forrest so dark and deep deep I would never find my way out, that werent branches but teeth at the entrance of a gaping mouth, and a House that was not a house but was that mouth, open and waiting and somehow so inviting, and I would be happy there, I could be happy there, I could learn to be happy there and all things were eternal and I could be happy I could

The thing in the window slammed its fists against the glass so hard that I don't know how it didn't break it, it was only glass after all, and reality slammed just as harshly back into me.

I let go of the handle.

And I threw up, right there on the pristinely white front porch. 

I ran. 

I ran past the trees and out the gate, and was disoriented by how small everything seemed again, how it was only just a little garden with a little fence and I was out in the street in maybe a few seconds, and there was the road looking like any old road and that neighbouring house was lit cozily, and it was safe and it was normal. They were cooking something with cinnamon in it. I could smell the warm scent of it in the air as I heaved, as I cried on the side of the road like a lunatic.

Behind me was just a House. Nothing in the window. No light that wasn't light.

Just a house.

I cried all the way home.

I've stopped going back since. I've only been there once, on an unassuming afternoon about a week ago, just to check. Just to make sure. In that way you pick at open wounds, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't entirely off my rocker and there was a house there at all, that the ground hadnt swallowed it up and left a gaping hole in the ground, or something. I made sure to pick a light, sweet day with pretty sunshine, and people smiling. That smell of almost winter in the air that I love, always reminding me that it's my birthday soon. I never thought I'd get this old, and it's a good thought. and it was right there, clean and white and painfully ordinary, somehow more mundane to me than ever before in the daylight.

Just a house.

I looked at it for a while, and still no lights were on because of course they weren't, and I saw the guy that lives in the neighboring house out on the lawn, doing something to his car. Don't ask me what, I don't know anything about them. He seemed to be cheerfully tinkering under the hood of it, so I hoped I’d catch him in a good mood.

Yes, he said he knew the house. It had remained quiet and peaceful for as long as he’d lived there. No, there wasn’t anything odd about it, why was I asking? 

“It’s just…” I said, grasping at a suitable straw, “I found the cat that sometimes leaves their yard and I was wondering when they’d be around, the owners in that house.”

I had obviously not, and if I had the thing would have probably clawed my eyes out or possessed my soul or something. It felt like a suitably horror-protagonist thing to say, though, and the guy nodded slowly.

“Sure, that,” he said, as if remembering the little beast brought as much anxiety in him as it did in me. It was weirdly comforting that I wasn't alone. He stroked his chin in thought and a black smear of oil was left on his chin. He looked distant for a moment, far off. “I agree they’re not around much, although sometimes I can see… Sometimes there’s a… In the backyard…” 

I knew what was in their backyard. We avoided each other’s eyes until he coughed, snapping out of wherever he’d gone awkwardly. I thanked him for not knowing much but trying, and I grabbed a few apples out of the basket and hurried off, hoping I wouldn’t be ‘that weirdo neighbor’ from now on. Things like that spread easily and I’m already a bit of a peculiar figure, walking around late at night in my vampire coat and docs.

I'm starting to wonder just how much strange shit goes on in this world because I know now that you don't tell anyone about it when it does. You lock it up inside your head, and forget, choose to forget, do your very best to forget. what would I say? If I did say something, you would call me crazy.

So, just this once, I've written it all down, before I let it fade away or really go nuts. I don't have time for that. I’ve worked too damn hard to really let myself slip away, especially to a moment of recklessness and stupid, morbid curiosity. Hey, I guess that's what they'd call progress. a few years ago I wouldn't have thought that way at all. A few years ago I was chasing every socket I could find to stick my finger in, but I'm tired. It does eat at me a little, of course it does, the fear and the doubt, the memory of floating into emptiness like some unholy sea. Of being trapped forever. I'm only human. Sometimes I can't sleep. I try not to think about it too much, not to let me brain do that thing where it spirals into places too deep to crawl out of. I've stopped drinking entirely, and that helps. I've taken up running, would you believe it, I have the stupid shoes and water bottle with a little reflex and everything, and it helps too. I hate it, but it helps. My route is an entirely different direction to that fucking... thing, and I stay as far away as I can.

It helps.

I’ve bought a snowflake string light for my balcony. I vape like a dickhead. I’ve decided to make this place a home, not just somewhere I live.

I hope someone out there maybe gets a kick out of this, because I still love a good story and I always will. and that's what it’ll have to be to me now. Just a story, before one day hopefully I forget all about it, stop sleeping with the light on.

Just a story about a house.

Just a house.

But you know it's not.

The only thing that really keeps me up and frays at my nerve endings are the dreams that sometimes slip through. Flashes of that night, the shape in the window, its screams. Normal enough, and they’re becoming very rare, but every once in a while something slips through and I can’t focus on anything else. The feeling of being sucked underwater stays with me all day. The worst part is the more I analyze everything from a safer distance, the less I believe my first impressions. The more I have them, the more I’m becoming certain of what it was screaming at me, and I don’t think it was threatening. I’ll never be one hundred percent positive, but I’m pretty sure it was… 

“Don’t.”
