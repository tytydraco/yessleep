The sirens of the police car were the only thing keeping me grounded as we pulled into my neighborhood. Every streetlamp I passed felt like a small victory against the suffocating darkness of that school. Finally, we stopped in front of my house. The lights were on, casting a warm, yellow glow onto the driveway. It looked so painfully normal—so quiet. I didn't even wait for the officer to come around and open the door; I scrambled out, my legs shaking, and ran toward the entrance.

I hammered on the heavy wooden door, my sobs breaking the silence of the night. I expected the door to fly open. I expected my mother to scream my name, her face stained with tears, pulling me into a bone-crushing hug. I had practiced what I would say to comfort her.

The door creaked open slowly. It was my father. He stood there in his house clothes, but his face… there was no terror in his eyes. No relief. Just a cold, polite confusion that chilled me more than the night air.

"Yes, young lady?" he said, his voice steady and calm, as if he were talking to a delivery person. "Are you lost? Did you get the wrong address?"

The world tilted. I pushed past him, collapsing into the hallway as he stood there in shock. I screamed for my mother at the top of my lungs. She stepped out from the kitchen, holding her evening coffee. Even in my panic, I noticed how she stayed back, ensuring she wasn't in the direct line of sight of the male officer at the door—a habit of modesty ingrained in our culture. She looked at the policeman, then at me, and asked with genuine curiosity, "Is there a problem, officer? Who is this girl?"

I started babbling, my words tripping over each other. I reminded them of our last family trip to the desert, showed them the initials on my schoolbag, begged them to look into my eyes. They just traded pitying glances, looking at me like I was some poor, mentally ill stranger who had wandered off the street and into their lives.

"Honey, we don't have a daughter named Raghad," my mother said softly, her voice full of a terrifying kindness.

I bolted toward my bedroom. I needed my ID, my childhood photos—anything to prove I wasn't a ghost. I flung the door open and my heart hit the floor. It wasn't my room. It was a storage space. Dilapidated, thick with the smell of old dust and stagnant air, piled high with cardboard boxes I didn't recognize. My bed, my clothes, my posters of the stars… everything was gone. It was as if I had never taken a single breath in that house.

Frantic, I began tearing through the boxes, throwing old papers and junk aside. Beneath layers of dusty curtains, I found a single, framed photo. My parents were smiling at a park, but there was a jagged, faded gap in the center next to them—as if someone had been physically erased from the film.

At the bottom of the box, my fingers brushed against leather. An old diary. The handwriting on the cover was an exact, haunting match to my own. It read: "My name is Raghad. If they forget me… the school is the reason."

The realization hit me like a physical blow, stealing the air from my lungs. The "other" Raghad—the one the girls whispered about—wasn't just a legend. She was a victim, just like me. I understood now. Anyone who is trapped in that storage room after hours isn't just forgotten; they are scrubbed away from the very fabric of the world’s memory.

The police eventually led me back outside, apologizing to my "parents" for the disturbance. They told me I must have confused this house for another in my traumatized state. I’m standing in the street now, the cold wind biting through my uniform. I am completely alone, except for the "Black Shadow." I can see it now, standing just out of reach, its featureless face reflected in the dark glass of the street windows. It’s watching me, waiting for the very last piece of my identity to vanish into the night.
