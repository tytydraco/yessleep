I did it. I killed that dastard, and I feel GREAT! Weeks of torment, of pain, or fear, it’s all over. It was so simple, why didn’t I think of it before? I could have saved myself a whole lot of pain. Let me start from the beginning, I know I haven’t been the most cohesive throughout this entire experience but to be fair to myself I was doodoo pants scared out of my mind the entire process. I tried to be brave and analytical, but I was never good at that crap. It feels so GOOD to be me again! I can laugh! I can joke! I can go back to my wife and kids! My beautiful wife and kid. Kid? I can’t remember how many I have. I can’t remember their names.

I’m sure it’ll all come back to me after a good nap. I’m sleep deprived and stressed out. I’ve been through some serious trauma. Let me regale you with my triumph though. I still haven’t forgotten all of you other people getting stalked out there. Okay. Let’s take it from the top, for real this time.

So, when I left off, I was on the other side of the world. I was still trying to run so I thought that would give me some time, but it turned out to not really help at all. Still, I decided if I was going to suffer, I would rather suffer at home than some place where it rains snakes and tarantulas, so I booked the flight back. While on the plane, I could see that thing running, following me until we got up above the clouds. It was fast. Ungodly fast, like I don’t know that the laws of physics can explain how a 12 foot titan can be that fast but I guess were beyond the realm of science aren’t we? On the plane I tried to figure out what emotions I could still feel. After many movies, I came to the alarming conclusion I was only left with four; nervous, frightened, shock, and rage. Both nervous and frightened seem like subsets of fear, shock is a subset of surprise, and rage is of anger. I wasn’t sure if the Hollower would take both nervous and fright at the same time. Going off of its previous sadistic tendencies I guessed it would drag this out as long as possible.

When I landed, I got my answer. As I deboarded the plane it launched itself through my chest. I felt the hole ripping through me as it dove claws-first through my body as if it were a dolphin jumping through a hoop. I collapsed in pain and was rushed to medical. They said they thought I had a minor heart attack and advised me to take it easy. I assured them I would then quickly went running off. I checked my feelings again, well I certainly felt shock as that thing when through me. I certainly felt afraid at the moment. I thought about my family and how nervous I was about them finding me in this state. How nervous I WAS. I couldn’t feel it anymore. I no longer worried about if they had reported me missing and if I would be detained. The rotten parasitic freak. Yep, rage was still all there and building.

As I exited the airport the voices grew louder, but I knew better than to do anything crazy at an airport. “That’s where they expect it the most.” I thought.  “I’d be better off going to a mall and- NO. Stop that. Those aren’t your thoughts. Those aren’t you.” It was getting harder to differentiate that thing’s influence and my own thoughts. I rushed off quickly even though I knew it would be close behind me. Always right behind me.

Though my soul felt frozen over, I was desperate for any food other than airplane food. I no longer worried about if my car was being monitored and so I took it out of the parking lot and drove to the nearest fast food place. I was starving. Is hunger an emotion? Maybe I had 3 emotions left at the time. How twisted would that be? If it had hollowed me out to the point where I couldn’t care anymore then it took my ability to feel hunger and watched as I wasted away. Man, these are some sick puppies I’m telling you. Anyways, it had just attacked me, so I figured that I had some time. I was SO wrong. Right as I was about to get my food it came through the counter and crushed my head between its claws. The agony was excruciating, and my chest hadn’t recovered yet so, I felt like I was just a walking pair of arms and legs. I grasped onto consciousness but couldn’t hold on and everything faded to black.

When I woke up paramedics were about to lift me onto a stretcher. I screamed at them not to touch me, and it stunned them long enough for me to bolt and get into my car. They tried to stop me; they were pulling on the door handle, but I’d already locked it. In hindsight I do appreciate the above and beyond effort they gave trying to help me. I feel bad now about running two of them over. In my defense, all I could think at the time was if they trapped me in a hospital, it would all be over for me. I hope they both are recovering nicely. I also hope I don’t end up with criminal charges. I hadn’t thought that far until now.

Anyways, I gunned it. I didn’t know where I was going, I just drove. I kept driving and driving until an idea popped into my head. Dance club. It was brilliant! “If I drove my car into a dance club there would be so many people injured and killed that a tragedy of that size would- NO.” I had to shut it out again. Dance club wasn’t a terrible idea though. A place filled with joy and fun might be what I need to shake this monster off. That might be why it eats people’s joy and love first. It is weak to those feelings, and it needs to get rid of them. So, I drove to the dance club and hid myself in the mess of people. I was wrong, again.

While I did notice a lack of other Hollowers in the area, I also noticed the voices getting louder. I tried to shut them out, check my feelings. I’m afraid. I’m afraid of that thing. I’m afraid of what I might do. I want to just rip it apart. I want to tear it limb from limb like it has been tearing me. It then dawned on me; I am no longer shocked. I’m not shocked by my actions. I ran over two people and didn’t bat an eye. I forgot to check myself after the restaurant attack. I’m down to two emotions left. I’m at the same breaking point that Sonny was at.

In that moment I realized I needed to escape. I needed to get as far away from people as I could. I ran out the back door, but the Hollower realized what I was doing. He cut me off at the back door and sank his claws through my eyes. In that moment I no longer felt the panic I had to get away from people. I no longer feared what I would do. The Hollower lifted me off the ground as it spoke venom into my mind. “Rip them apart. Tear their entrails from their bodies and string them up on the ceiling. Drown the floor with their blood. Reduce them to gore and splinters.”  Its deep, distorted voice echoed in my brain growing louder and louder. I’d never lost my temper before, but at that moment my rage is all I had.

I lashed out at the Hollower, and to what should have been my shock, I connected. My fist felt like it was torn down to the bone as it connected with the monster, but all I had was rage. It dropped me, stunned, and I wasted no time attacking its leg. I balled my hands into one large fist and swung as hard as I could at the back of its knee. The blow was successful and brought the beast down. It swung wildly at me, pain clawing through my chest and shattering my legs. The pain only fueled my rage. It desperately tried to redirect me by shouting in my mind. “Kill the dancers, baptize yourself in their blood and you will be freed.”

Its words could not sway me, instead they drove me over the edge. “I’m not a part of your game.” I shouted back at the abomination. I climbed its jagged body up towards its neck, remembering the first strike it landed on me. “Your rage is wasted on me. You will not find peace without blood.” I ignored its words. I did not want peace. I did not want anything anymore. I was reduced to a vessel of pure rage. “You made me this way. You poured this fuel to my rage. Now watch me use it to break you.” I spat my words of spite at it as I went into a frenzy, clawing furiously at the throat of the beast.

It screamed. It flailed. It dug its claws into me again and again. Pain tore my body into two. Pain severed my head. Pain ripped off my limbs, but pain was not physical. I was. My nails tore chunks of black void from the creature and sent it splattering across the pavement. My fists slammed down on its head until ooze leaked from it. Despite the pain making my body feel like it was reduced to atoms, I attacked relentlessly until the Hollower was hollowed. I had carved out most of its neck and ripped apart the final strand holding its head on its body. I broke open its chest and carved out all the void flesh I could empty. I ripped its arm from its body and sunk its claws into its own eye sockets. I felt GREAT.

That brings me to where I am now, in a hotel room surveying my condition before I return to my life. With it dead, my connection to the Hollowers seems to be fading. I can still see them on tape, but I haven’t seen one in person since. I don’t know for sure what I’m going to do. I think I might tell the police I was kidnapped and drugged. That’s kind of what happened, just missing the part that the being responsible is a 12 monster of unknown origin. I feel like myself again. I even got my funny bone back; I didn’t know that was an emotion. I hope this helps any of you who are stalked by a Hollower. Fight back! Take them by surprise though, who knows what would have happened if that thing tried to throw me. Would it just throw my spirit, or would I have gone splat?

 I can’t wait to get home. I bet my family has been worried sick. My only concern is this void gunk/blood/ flesh/whatever, it won’t come off. In fact, the more I look at myself the more I find on me. It’s almost as if it’s growing. I figure it just can’t be scrubbed off with normal stuff but it should eventually fall off, right? I didn’t try too hard to get it off either. The hot water here must be broken because it was ice cold no matter what I set the faucets to. I can’t stand cold showers. I’m hoping that this stuff will be invisible to my wife considering its origin. Otherwise, it’ll be hard to explain why half my body is covered in black ichor. I even have shards of that thing still stuck inside me too. They’re getting bigger so I think they’re worming their way out. I wonder how they got so deep, but at least it doesn’t hurt. Anyways, that’s my saga over. Wish me luck! I hope you don’t see me on the news!
