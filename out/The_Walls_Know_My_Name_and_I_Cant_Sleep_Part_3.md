The neighbor I mentioned in my first post? The house next door with the glowing window? Yeah, he’s had access to our cabin this entire time. I only found out this morning. 



The three of us all slept in the same room last night, huddled on the floor. The air was chilly in the room. Joelaine was shivering uncontrollably. I could feel the goosebumps all down her arms as I held her, even with a blanket. Nothing disturbed us, except the relentless wind of the night. Maybe the prayer I whispered helped.



This morning I woke up feeling stiff. As I sat up, I could feel an indent across my upper back—where I had been resting against the wooden bedframe. I itched it with my hand, looking down at Joelaine hugging my legs. *Don’t even bother packing everything out of the kitchen,* I told myself, *just get in the truck and then we’re out of here. Where’s Edith?*



My muscles groaned as I reached over my shoulder for a pillow on the bed. Reaching under Joelaine’s head I lifted it then replaced my legs with the pillow. She mumbled to herself clutching the edge tightly. I tucked her blonde hair back, out of her face, and petted her head before standing. Maybe Edith had moved somewhere around the other side of the bed. At least that’s what I had hoped. My heart began to beat more quickly as other possibilities flooded my mind. Where could she be? 



I heard someone speaking downstairs. It was my sister’s voice. 



Upon hearing her I rushed out of the room, avoiding the hazardous wood chips still scattered, and halted at the stairwell. There was Edith down at the bottom. She was facing away from me. She was nodding as another, deeper voice spoke. 



“Edith?” I called her in alarm. “Who are you talking to?” 



I must have looked like a mess standing there, all covered in dust, hair sticking up in odd angles. Edith’s tired eyes widened when she turned to look at me. “Th…this is Azrael,” she told me. “He’s the one who’s been putting out the mouse traps.”



I stumbled down grabbing my sister’s shoulder as I faced Azrael. He was a young man, around my age, dressed completely in black. He had a bit of facial hair. Enough that his greasy blonde mustache had begun to curl. “How did you get in?” I demanded looking him up and down. 



He smirked, pulling a key from his shirt pocket. “The old man let me know you were coming. I come in every so often to check in on the place. Make sure everything’s alright during your stay.” 



“Pretty normal to have something like that,” said Edith behind me, “especially a place that spends so long empty. I was telling him we heard people walking around last night. It must have been the cleaners.”



“My uncle didn’t tell me…” I said, “maybe you could have knocked or something? Let us know you were coming in? 



“Are you sure you’re getting enough sleep?” asked Azrael, still grinning as he ignored me. His almond eyes seemed to be laughing as they peered into me. 



I didn’t answer.



He smiled all the way to the front entrance as the floorboards groaned under his boots. He pulled the heavy door open and I followed him out onto the deck. He marched off pushing a yellow wheelbarrow towards the neighboring house. 



“Get your stuff together, Edith,” I told her, “we’re leaving.” 



“Why?” She followed me as stepped down the rickety walkway to the gravel. “This explains what we heard last night. It was nothing.”



I spun towards her. “Did you not see? Remember last night? The voices? What they said? What do you think that thing was that ran past? You must have smelled it.” 



She paused at that last point, thinking it over. “You already had us so scared,” she said “I’m sure it was just the cleaners moving around. You were nervous before we even got here. I know you’re still just upset about George. You got us all scared, so that’s why we saw things.”



“Seriously?” I asked in disbelief, “you think I’m making up all this?”  I shook my head at her, as I continued towards the truck. It was where I had left it, green paint glistening under the light of early morning. I noticed it was leaning forward oddly. With a frown I approached the hood. The front tires had been slashed. I noticed the marks instantly. Thick tears horizontal across each surface. The holes were clean, clearly done with a tool. 



“Damn it,” I cursed under my breath. It was a confirmation of my suspicions. It’s not just animals we need to worry about. 



Edith either didn’t notice or wasn’t concerned. “I’m gonna go in and put my makeup on,” she said in a voice that sounded almost bored. 



I thought I’d be past the point of having to convince her… after what the three of us went through. I didn’t even know what to say to my sister. I love Edith, but I don’t know how there could be any doubts that something was very wrong. I still don’t understand.



“Fine,” I just said, “I think I’m out of wipes though if you’re still using my bag. Maybe ask Joelaine before you take hers.”



“What are you on about?” Edith scowled, “I brought my own purse. Keeping it upstairs with me.” 



“Then who?” I felt myself growing pale. 



“Azreal was right,” she tilted her head to one side. “You look like you really could use some sleep. She headed back to the cabin as I just stood there helplessly. 



Edith slammed the door on the way in. I winced, eyes darting across to the neighbors. It might have been just an animal, but something ducked into the bushes as I looked over… it was watching me. 



I ran into the cabin. 



Climbing the stairs two at a time, I headed towards my room. Joelaine was awake by now, sitting cross legged on the bed. As I barged through the doorway she looked up, alert, her right hand drifting to the ax which lay on the far corner of the bed. 



“Oh,” she sighed with relief, clenching a hand to her heart.



“Sorry,” I gasped. Walking over I went and sat down beside her. I noticed she pulled her left leg closer when I got closer. “Your leg was caught in something yesterday in the pit,” I nodded towards it, “are you alright?”



“Yeah…” 



“Can I see it?” 



“I guess so…yeah.” Sometime in the night she had wrapped in fabric, one of her shirts, pink with white buttons. She was hesitant to reveal it fully. 



“You were bleeding?” I asked, touching it gently. “What do you think it was clamping down on it?” 



“I don’t think it’s bleeding now” she answered slowly, “so if you want maye you could take a look at it? I couldn’t see it well in the dark.”



“Alright,” my fingers loosened the knot and gave it a soft tug. The edges of the fabric were bloody. I could feel it on my skin as the shirt unraveled. The first mark I found was a circular indent. Joelaine looked away as I pressed my finger just beneath the wound. *It doesn’t look deep,* I thought. Even still, a patch of dry blood was plastered over her short blonde hair. I held my breath as the rest was revealed. A horseshoe of circular bloody indents, one set on the front of her thigh, and a second down the back. It was clearly a bite mark. 



We exchanged a glance. The bite looked human. I knew we were both thinking it. “I was thankful the bleeding had stopped.” I wrapped my arms around her, holding her in a tight embrace. “I’m so sorry. I never would have driven us here…”



“It’s not your fault.”



“Edith still doesn’t see anything wrong,” I said, breathing in and out deeply as I struggled to calm the drum of my heart. 



“She must after what we saw last night…” Joelaine lowered her head onto my shoulder. “She’s just putting on a brave face.” 



“Maybe. She’s been acting kind of strange I think.” 



“Something’s alive down there,” her eyes looked frantic then, “whatever bit me… we aren’t safe here. What are we still doing here?” 



“They slashed my tires.” 



“What?” her hand gripped me tighter. 



“It looked pretty bad, I don’t think I can get us out of here. I was gonna try texting Uncle Stan.” 



“That’s still an 8-hour drive for him. What are we supposed to do until then?” 



“The ax, give it to me.” 



“What…” 



I grabbed the hilt, taking it from her. “You’re staying in here. Lock the door until I get back.”



“Don’t leave me…” She grabbed hold of my shoulder tightly. “What are you planning?” 



“We need to protect ourselves before darkfall. Until Uncle Stan can get to us… I don’t know how long before he’ll even get my message. I don’t think the pelts can move during the day, I’m going to get Edith to help me move them. Then I’m going to secure the doors.” 



“I guess that makes sense.” Her grip on me loosened. “Just be careful ok?” 



“I’m going to be back soon. Promise” 



I intentionally failed to mention that I was heading to the basement first. I needed answers. Needed to know what that thing was. Whatever had hurt my sister, I would make it bleed. My knuckles were white on the hilt as I made my way through the house. Everything was quiet. Shouldn’t that have been a comfort? Every step felt like wandering through a crowded stadium of hungry eyes. Walls that knew my name. 



Down into the basement I headed towards the pit, growing ever more tense. As before, the light of the room only lasted so far. I pulled my phone out of my pocket, fumbling with one hand to open the flashlight. The stains on the pale wall were illuminated. Tilting it down, I saw something flash white inside the hole. My thumb swiped to my camera and I took a picture. Nothing. I cursed when I saw it. Just an empty pit in the dirt, a piece of flat plywood at the bottom. 



I had taken a live photo—meaning the camera had recorded a few frames I could choose from. Taping edit I scrolled back, and the glint of white came into focus. I could see it, the thing that bit my sister’s leg. Here’s a screenshot of what I found: ([https://imgur.com/a/3vgN6yk](https://imgur.com/a/3vgN6yk) ). If you can’t see, at the bottom of the pit is a small hole. Under it was a mouth of teeth. 



I slammed the ax into the ground. The blade sliced right through and I heard a gurgling shriek. I pulled the ax free and watched the spurt of blood over the floor. Without hesitation I slashed again. The thin board was already collapsing in on itself as I jumped down. I felt an adrenaline rushing through me I can’t describe. I was angry, to the point that the fear almost consuming me dissipated. 



A mouth lunged up through the ground, then a second, then third, then fourth. The ground was alive, splitting and cracking like dry paint. A fleshy mound. Something bit down on the tip of my shoe. I kicked in its teeth, cutting its face wildly with my ax. The sound of popping flesh and pus erupted. I was almost tripping in gore as the thing undulated beneath me. Fleshy growth grabbed up like living mud tangling itself in my legs. The blade sliced through it before it could scrape higher than my thighs. 



I think I killed it. I don’t know what it was, but it stopped moving. An ooze with many mouths, eyes and limbs. It’s not hurting my sister ever again.   



I wanted to do a quick recap of all the facts I know so far. I know animals are rising from death and wandering our cabin at night. I know there’s something wrong with the neighbors. Now that there’s nothing stopping them from getting inside… hiding in a closet while we sleep. I killed something in the basement. Something with a human mouth that bit my sister’s leg. I’m worried most about her. 



I still have to do the rest. Move the pelts, barricade the doors. Afterwards, I think I’m going to take Edith’s advice. I’m going to bed early tonight, but I don’t know if I’ll sleep. Sorry this one took a little longer to upload; once again, connection isn’t great. 



Thanks for all the support so far, 

Beatrice.
