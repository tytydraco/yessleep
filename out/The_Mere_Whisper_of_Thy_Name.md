*Your mere presence is enough to make reality unravel.*

*The mere knowledge of your existence is enough to grant eternal bliss.*

*The mere whisper of thy name is enough to invite you into our minds.* 

These were the words I found while examining an ancient antique box. Unfortunately, those three lines, which I've translated the best I can, failed to capture the true horror of what lay within. 

I will spare you details such as my name or where exactly I happen to work.

 I wouldn't want any of you accidentally stumbling upon this. After all, it's for your own good. 

Ignorance isn't just bliss, but it is essential to your safety, to your happiness.

There were some other religious symbols scattered on top of the box which I couldn't figure out. 

Within the box, there was a broken idol; the top half of it had been smashed, leaving only a vague mass at the bottom. That's how I could best describe what was left there. I could discern nothing further from that. Not that I had to.

At its base, written in an ancient Phoenician script that I didn't know how to read, was inscribed something.

I would only learn far too late that it was a name.

My only mistake was looking at that name. 

It didn't matter that I didn't understand the language or even the individual letters; the mere sight of those letters meant that I had some understanding of what It was. That is all I will refer to that thing as: 'It.'

And the moment that I understood what It was, It had already invaded my mind.

It started out small: the occasional whispers coming from the shadows, the darkest corners of my house, even though I live all alone. 

The vague sensation that I was being watched, even though there was no one there. And a chill that seemed to envelop me constantly like a blanket made of the cold northern wind even on the hottest summer day.

This went on for a few weeks. I was lucky in that all I had seen was its name; that probably protected me, because the more that you learn about It, the more It learns about you. 

And the more that It learns about you, the more it can invade your mind. However, I'd still invited it inside my cranium just by glancing at those letters. A man's mind is his own fortress, and it had already laid siege to mine, if ever so slightly, and was already working its machinations. It had found a chink in my armor, and it was hammering away at it, wanting to widen this gap. The wider it got, the more it could sink in, and the faster this process became in a quickly developing negative spiral.

It must have been able to influence me subconsciously, because despite these feelings, I went searching for a translation. A translation to that name that I had seen. I'd only translated the first part of it when I fully realized what kind of mistake I had made. However, now that I understood It more firmly, It understood me more firmly as well.

I tried my hardest to not decipher the rest of its name, but that night I dreamed. I dreamed of a figure standing above me. I saw it. It was only the tiniest fraction of it, like the clipped fingernail of a human, and even that is something that I couldn't describe. Even if I wanted to, it's for the best that I don't. Of course I don't want any of you to accidentally imagine what it looked like.

As I saw It, and It saw me; much as gazing into the abyss reveals oneself to the abyss as well it infiltrated further into my mind. It's all that I can think about now. It 

I haven't even left my house in the last three days. That thing... It has no benevolence. If there is one thing I know about It, it's that It is evil - the kind of thing that drives its followers to madness. There is no 'eternal bliss' to be found like the inscription said, only eternal madness. Then again, the person who had written that had likely become completely enamored with It to have written such a thing in the first place. 

I'm losing my mind, trying my hardest to cling to what little shred of sanity I have before terror overwhelms me. 

I don't want to go outside. I'm also going to shut off my internet connection after I'm done typing this out. After all, I don't want to accidentally look up even more information on It.

The reason why I speak of events in such a roundabout manner is just because I know the people who work with me might read this.

 And I implore those people to destroy what I had found. Do not look at the engravings. I've already destroyed my notes, but I'm too scared of what that thing will do to me if I walk outside.

That it might seize my mind and, in a fit of madness, force me into such a condition that I could not destroy that statue. Whatever cult had made that box has long since perished. However, I feel that it will soon rise again if something is not done. It's too late.

You might be able to fix this. 

Good luck, you'll be needing it...
