It’s a story my mother told me and my sister years after it actually happened because she did not want to scare us. 

First of all, English is not my mother language so excuse mistakes in grammar/vocabulary.

My mother, my younger sister (3) and me (7) moved into a small apartment with 3 rooms, around 2005/6. It was an old house, my sister and me shared a room together, my mom had her small bedroom and a big living room. I remember shortly after moving in I‘ve had the worst fever ever, I never felt that sick in my life. I used to throw up, could barely sleep and even started hallucinating. I remember having the weirdest dreams, about dark figures staring at me and walking around my room. It was the time I started sleepwalking, but it never stopped until we moved out. That was the time my mother would already feel uneasy and kind of scared. 

Later she would tell me her point of view:

When I started to sleepwalk, something else changed in that apartment. She could not tell if it was the energy around, but she would say that anytime she would go to sleep, it seemed like a layer of strong darkness was growing around the room. She used to sleep on her belly, but woke up several times each night because she felt a kind of pressure on her back. She was unable to move, she was scared and she didn’t experience something like that before. Also there was little me walking around at night, standing randomly in her bedroom and talking nonsense. It creeps her out to this day thinking about it. 

Once she brought a babysitter to our apartment because she was dating someone. When she came back the babysitter was kinda freaking out „Someone put all water taps on“. My mother told her that I was sleepwalking and probably put them on but the babysitter wasn’t believing it. She would never babysitting us again, unfortunately. 

Another time my mother went to the bathroom, randomly our cat was standing at the bathroom door, starring into nowhere, she started hissing and growling. Nothing was there. The cat kept focusing onto something that wasn’t visible. My mother went back to the living room as fast as she could. Later that evening she noticed a buzzing sound coming from the kitchen. Already scared to look after it she enters the kitchen, looking straight at the clock. The clock hands were spinning and that was the buzzing sound she heard. She directly went out and called her neighbourhood friend to come over. Later, Both were standing in our kitchen, not believing their eyes and mouths wide open. Without words they smashed the clock out the window. She left and they never talked about it again. 

At some point my sister and me slept together with our mom in her bedroom, she was glad we did. My sister woke up one night, she was four at the moment, waking up my mother. „I want to sleep in my own bed“ my mother was curious why she would prefer sleeping alone, she asked what was wrong or if she had a bad dream. "the man is always staring at me, the man with lines above his mouth" my mother did not know what to say. There was no one. "I want to be in my bed". My mother was terrified, but brought her in her room. She would leave a small light on from now. 

A few nights later I was visiting my friend over night, my sister refused to sleep at my mothers bedroom so my mom would sleep there by herself. It was summer and the sun would go up earlier, it was already sunrise when she would wake up from a kind of stroking near her feet. She thought it was the cat. Then she realised the cat was sleeping beside her head (as she would always do). Terrified again, unable to move, too scared to look what was actually stroking her feet, her feet laying near the edge of the bed. It took her a moment but she finally raised her head. She gets goosebumps anytime she speaks about it to this day, she is very sure she was a 100% awake and she did not have sleep paralysis or anything. 

What she saw, it was coming from underneath the bed and as the light from the upcoming sun was lighting the room already, she could see it clearly. It was a foot, not Male not female, and instead of toes it had bony fingers.  It was stroking her feet. She couldn’t scream but quickly moved away. The foot would to the same. Moving away under her bed. It took her a second to catch her breath again. She RAN out that bedroom. She never ever slept there again. No one even really entered it. We moved out 1 or 2 months later. 

My sleepwalking ended directly when we moved out. No crazy dreams like this ever again. My mother could sleep again. I have no idea what was wrong there. We actually don’t want to. I think it wasn’t something good.
