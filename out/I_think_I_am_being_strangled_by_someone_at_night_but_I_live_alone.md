It started with me waking up one day with a sore throat and throbbing head, I couldn't pinpoint what the cause was, I thought it was due to seasonal change and tried to go about my day, praying that the pain wouldn't worsen.

Luckily, it went off by it's own by evening and I felt really relieved but it returned the next day, the pain in my throat more intense than the last time, I thought I had caught cold and took some medicine to help ease the pain.

It seemed to work and the pain seemed to lessen but then I started having nightmares, a hazy hand would try to choke me, I couldn't see the face of my attacker nor where I was.

But I could feel them choking me, I could feel the air leaving my body and blood rushing towards my face, it was all very painful but what terrified me the most was that I was frozen in my place, unable to defend myself, unable to do anything as my attacker choked me!

I woke up in the middle of the night one day, I was literally bathed in sweat, I had the same painful and intense nightmare, it was worse than any nighmare I had ever had!

It hadn't worried me before but now I had started thinking maybe it just wasn't a nightmare, it was too real, too intense, to be dismissed as a nightmare!

The pain in my throat, the throbbing in my head, were all signs of something more sinister and I decided I couldn't take chances and risk my life, so I decided to investigate, I checked my doors and windows, any sign that someone had broken into my home but I didn't find what I was looking for.

As much as I hated to dismiss it, I had to let go of the idea that someone had broken into my home but then I was left wondering what was really going on, was I going mad or was I stressed and the stress was resulting in me having those nightmares?

I could find no concrete answers so I decided to keep a night watch, half of my mind thought it was a wild idea and I was going too far but the other half agreed with me and I decided to go with the latter half.

Three hours passed and my night watch continued but nothing happened, everything was still, as still as a pond, the stillness was starting to become eerie but nothing unusual happened, I was starting to become sleepy and even coffee wasn't much help.

I was nearly about to fall asleep when the light bulb flickered and went off, it jolted me awake and I went and checked it, it wasn't working, as I switched on another light, it flickered and went off too, I couldn't understand what was happening!

I sat down on the couch terrified, my body froze in fear, it was just like the nightmare and I wished nothing unusual would happen anymore but I guess my prayers went unanswered because I felt a sensation around my throat.

It was as if someone had placed a hand on my throat but that wasn't the end, the sensation grew stronger until I couldn't breathe, I wanted to lift my hand, do anything to defend myself but my body remained paralysed with fear.

As I thought this is the end and felt guilty for going down without any struggle, the sensation ceased and it felt as if someone slammed me onto the floor, my head hit the carpet and I gasped for breath!

I was in a lot of pain and coughing badly but I was able to breathe and felt grateful for that, whatever was behind it, decided to spare my life, maybe it was a warning and I decided to take it.

I decided to stay at a friends house and planned to sell my house, nothing happened for the first few days, the only trouble I had was in not finding any buyer for the house but I was alive and healthy and I didn't have the courage to go back to my house.

Everything was returning back to normal when I woke up with a large scratch on my arm, it looked as if I had been attacked by a wild animal, my friend was as shocked as I was and I decided to go back to my house despite my friend pleading with me to not go back, I didn't want whatever it was to mess with my friend.

I knew I was making a stupid decision and my heart trembled with fear but I saw no other choice and went back, I had sleepless nights, I slept with all the lights on but nothing unusual happened until I saw scratches on my neck.

I don't know what it is, I am so scared and I don't know what to do, I see no options, I have to let whatever it is to keep messing with me, I am so helpless but there is no way out of it!
