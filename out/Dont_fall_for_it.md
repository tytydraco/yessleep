I realize now this is all his fault. He made that thing. If you're reading this, stay out of the bush in Australia. It could still be out there, and it’s smart.

This all started about a month ago. I was startled awake from my couch.

Knock! Knock! Knock!

Who the hell is all the way out here banging on my door this early?

I grumbled as I approached my front door and gazed through the peephole. Sure enough, there was a middle-aged man, balding with a wrinkled forehead and not very tall. He noticed the peephole and gave me a wide smile.

Well, this guy isn't creepy at all; might as well see what he wants. I opened the door, and the man greeted me.

"Hey there! I just moved in across the street... just wanted to say hello. I'm Tulio." His aged expression shifted to a grin.

Annoyed but not wanting to be disrespectful, I greeted him back. "Nice to meet you. Name's Ned." Hiding behind him, I noticed a little girl.

"Come now, don't be rude. Ned is our new neighbor," Tulio said. "Say hello."

"Hello..." the girl muttered, then more clearly this time, looked up at me and said, "I'm Olivia."

I smiled. My wife and I were expecting to have a little girl. Olivia's brown hair and eyes reminded me of my wife's—a beautiful shade of orange-brown like that of autumn leaves. I scratched the back of my head and greeted her as well. "It's nice to meet you, Olivia."

I glanced at the house across the street behind them; nobody had lived there for years. My house is in the middle of nowhere, and the other closest house is the one right across the long road that stretches for dozens of miles out of the woods. A strange place to put two random houses, I know. But apart from the terrible phone service and internet, for me, it was perfect.

"If you don't mind me asking... uh, Tulio, was it? What brings you around here?"

The corners of his grin shifted down slightly. "Well... the city life gets kind of overwhelming, you know? I had some trouble at my old job too. I decided to move out here before my old boss started looking to hire me back—haha! Besides, they need some space too." He pointed at the van parked beside the road. "I know. Let me introduce you."

I raised an eyebrow at Tulio. "Don't worry, haha, it's nothing strange," he said, noticing my suspicion. My curiosity piqued, I followed him and his daughter down the driveway leading to my front door and onto the pavement to the back of the van. "They must have grown tired of staying in here by now," he stated as he opened the doors to the van.

My eyes widened. Inside the van were all sorts of birds: parrots, peacocks, many that I'd never seen before. Tulio gave me a pat on the back and smiled. "Beautiful, aren't they? These guys are my whole life... I'm an ornithologist, you see."

"Ah, that explains all these birds then. I'm guessing you couldn't keep all of these back where you lived, right?"

Tulio's dark brown eyes looked down for a bit as if contemplating his next words. "Yes, something like that."

I looked back at the birds. They really were beautiful; all of them had vibrant colors, and there were species I'd never seen before. One of them, however, caught my eye. I'd read about them in a book back in middle school. It was a lyrebird, "nature's greatest mimic," I thought out loud.

"I see you noticed," Tulio said as he climbed into the van and took out the caged lyrebird. "This one is special to me, you see... she was my wife's favorite as well." I noticed Tulio's expression changed to one of melancholy.

"Your wife... where is she now?"

"She passed away not too long ago," Tulio looked down at the cage of the bird he was holding, his gentle grasp tightening ever so slightly on the wooden handle. "This bird has been with us for many years. It's all I have left to remember her by. But I like to believe my wife’s closer to us than you’d think."

There was silence between us for a bit, I knew the feeling he had all too well. I opened my mouth to try and break the silence with some words of comfort when the sound of a woman's soft voice stopped me.

"Tulio... I love youuu," sang the lyrebird. It was a gentle voice; even when replicated by a bird, it could give you a sense of ease. I looked down at the bird, its beady brown eyes staring back with intelligence I didn't think possible of an animal, and then I looked back at Tulio. I could see his eyes begin to dampen with tears, his surprised expression shifting to a grimace as he held them back.

Feeling a bit guilty about what had just happened, I racked my brain for anything I could say. "Wow, that bird's super cool. You're super lucky to have something like this; it's like a living recording of your wife, right?" I stammered.

Immediately, I regretted my words. I'm a dumbass; that was the worst thing I could've said. In what world is he lucky? For crying out loud, I should have been able to sympathize with the guy, and this is the best I could say?

But before I could apologize, Tulio flashed me a smile and wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his sweater. "You're right; this little one is a blessing... it's the reason I'm able to see her again after all."

In hindsight, that was a strange thing to say, but I was too busy feeling relieved he didn't take my words of "comfort" the wrong way to notice the grim meaning behind his previous statements.

Regaining his composure, Tulio spoke, "Now, me and Olivia could use some help bringing these guys inside, if you don't mind."

"Sure," I replied.

Tulio led the way to his house with Olivia following close behind him and then opened the front door. Inside, I was surprised to find that the house was already furnished, and not so surprised to find that everything was painted in a fine layer of dust. Aside from this, the only furniture of note was a large bookshelf and a portrait depicting a white-haired woman, clutching in her hand a long slender blade.

The portrait was beautiful, and as for the bookshelf, its contents were a little odd—books about biology and human anatomy, as well as bird anatomy. A couple, however, caught my eye—strange books about rituals and others about alchemical sciences. I took out another book that seemed the most normal. It read ''Hiding in Plain Sight'' by Susan Lewis. Disinterested, I placed the book back on the shelf and resigned from inspecting it further.

But then something else caught my eye. A small picture frame on a table by the bookshelf—there was something familiar about it. After looking at it for a while longer, I realized it was a picture of a young Tulio dressed in a white lab coat and a woman with long brown hair like that of autumn leaves. Why would he lie about just having moved here? Well, technically he never claimed to have not lived here, but something's off, I thought.

I decided to stay quiet about it and turned to face Tulio, who was admiring some of his "new" free furniture.

"Lucky me," Tulio laughed. "Must be from the folks who lived here. Too lazy to move stuff out, huh? Saves me some money."

"Looks like it," I replied.

Olivia ran up the dusty wooden stairs, yelling enthusiastically, "I'm gonna look at the rooms, Dad!"

"Okay, but be careful!" Tulio yelled back.

Together, we made our way back to the van and began to bring all the birds inside the spacious living room of Tulio's house. But when I was picking up the cage of a large parrot, I stopped to look at something. I put down the cage and got closer to the front of the van, where I saw a large bag leaning up against the wall of the van… in the shape of a human body. A strange smell was coming from it.

My heart sank, and a million thoughts raced through my mind in the span of a second. But my rushing thoughts stopped when I heard the sound of footsteps coming up to the rear of the van.

Tulio's once gentle and aged voice, now sounding cold and empty, called out to me, "Ned, you've been taking a while. Everything alright? That parrot should be the last one."

Deciding the best course of action was to act normal, I stammered, "Y-yeah, sorry, just having some trouble carrying the cage."

"Oh yeah, that one doesn't have a handle, huh? Sorry about that."

I carried the bird past Tulio, his small and unassuming figure now looking much larger in my eyes. Inside the house, I placed the cage down, and then my thoughts once again began to race. That bag could have been anything, but why was it shaped that way? Could this guy really be a murderer? What about his daughter? Does she know about this? When he comes back, what should I do?

The noise in my head was forced to quiet once again as I noticed Tulio returning, and to my horror, over one of his shoulders was the large bag. Act cool. He settled the bag down near the front door. I could feel a cold sweat running down my neck, and stupid as it may have been, I spoke.

“H-hey, uh... just out of curiosity, what’s in that bag?” I pointed towards the large bag he had just set down on the floor. Good going, dumbass, you just asked the now potential murderer about his painfully obvious victim. No way this could go wrong, huh?

“Oh, this?” Tulio looked down at the bag. A pit formed in my stomach as he pulled out a pocketknife from his back pocket. I watched in silence as he sliced open the top of the bag and reached his hand inside, showing me the contents. Seeds. The bag was full of bird feed.

I felt a wave of relief as my tensed body began to finally relax. Tulio put the knife back in his pocket and then approached me. He patted me on the shoulder and said, “Thanks for the help, Ned. My back has been killing me, you know, haha... I’m gonna go ahead and get the birds situated.”

I let out a nervous laugh. “Yeah, sure. Anytime you need anything, just let me know.”

That night, as I lay in bed, I remember feeling glad that my new neighbor seemed like a genuine guy, one that I had something in common with. When my wife and I lost our child, she couldn’t cope with it, and one night I found her hanging from our apartment balcony.

That night, seeing her cold, lifeless body swaying in the breeze, it took every ounce of will I had not to join her. I felt betrayed that she would leave me alone like this, without so much as telling me anything. After this, I became irritable and impossible to be around.

Not a day went by that I didn’t consider ending it all just to see her again, feel her again, listen to her again. I made plans to go through with it, but the day never came. Whether it was because I was too cowardly to end it or courageous enough to keep living, I'll never know.

So, I decided that the best thing for me now was to isolate myself. I had always loved nature and hiking, especially in the woods, and that’s what brought me here, to the middle of nowhere. At first, I thought my peace had been ruined when I woke up to that knock on my door, but now I was thinking maybe I could use the company.

The next few weeks were pretty normal, but now I was spending some of that time playing with Olivia, who I had noticed was always outside with some of the birds. The birds that weren’t good fliers were left outside within the confines of the very tall fence of Tulio’s house, although I never saw the lyrebird among them.

Spending time with Olivia was bittersweet; it made me think of what life could be like if I had my wife and daughter. But something was off. As the days went by, I saw Tulio less often. When I would see him, he had dark bags under his eyes, as if he was staying up all night doing something. The picture frame I had seen inside the house kept scratching at me.

One day I couldn’t put it off any longer. While playing with Olivia and the birds, I asked her, “Have you lived here before?”

Olivia looked at me, raising an eyebrow, and giggled. “No, silly, we just moved here, remember?”

“I know, but I was thinking maybe this was your old house or something. Or maybe your dad lived here before?”

Olivia put a finger to her chin and thought about it for a few seconds. “Nope, I have no idea.” Then she went back to playing with the birds.

I sighed and lay down on the grass. So not even Olivia knows anything. It’s honestly none of my business if Tulio used to live here and didn’t tell me anything, but why lie? And why come back here now, was there something he needed here?

Olivia stopped running around and looked over at me. “Oh, but you know, I never got to have my birthday party before coming here!”

“Oh yeah? Why not? How old are you now?”

“I’m 12! But when we moved out of our old house, Dad said that seeing Mom again was more important or something. He also said we didn’t have much time because the funny men from his job were looking for him. But I think he’s just kinda crazy ‘cause he’s getting old!” She laughed.

“Hey, that’s your dad! Show some consideration. He must have been really good at his job if his previous workplace is still trying to hire him back, huh? And you know what? How about we celebrate your birthday soon? Just let your dad know, and I’ll get everything ready,” I said as I brushed the grass off my clothes and headed home.

“Really!? Okay! It’s a promise then!” Olivia beamed as she waved goodbye.

Walking home, I thought about what she said. Tulio said they were going to see his wife again. He must be going through it still, and if that is his old house, then it must be bringing back bad memories. Maybe having this party will cheer him up a bit.

But the party would never come.

That night, I leaped out of bed to the sound of frantic banging on my door downstairs. I grabbed the bat I kept beside my bed and ran downstairs. As I got closer to the door, I recognized the screaming from the other side as Olivia’s voice. I dropped the bat and opened the door. She had tears running down her cheeks.

“My dad needs help! He’s really hurt!” she sobbed.

“What happened!?”

She struggled to speak through her sobbing and gasping breaths. “He went into the room he always tells me I’m not allowed to go in, but he hasn’t come out, and he was asking me for help.”

I told her to show me, and we ran across the street to Tulio’s house. As I got closer to the front door, I immediately noticed that none of the birds were making any sound. At the door to the living room, I noticed that the same bag of bird feed Tulio had cut open was gone. Although not seemingly important, this bothered me.

Then I heard Tulio’s unseen voice pleading for help.

“Please... help me!” he screamed.

“He’s over here!” Olivia yelled at me as she led me through the house to a basement door behind the stairs of the second floor.

“HELP ME, OPEN THE DOOR PLEASE,” Tulio pleaded from beyond the door, and I had never heard such desperation in another man’s voice before. Then I heard loud creaks come rushing closer to the door, and Tulio’s voice grew even more frantic. “QUICK OPEN THE—” His voice was cut short, followed by loud wooden creaks and thumping sounds, this time moving quickly away.

“Tulio!?” I called out. He must have fallen down the basement stairs, I thought to myself. I reached out and grabbed the door handle; it was locked. There’s no time for this. Tulio could be hurt. I slammed my body against the door repeatedly, and then with a final heave, I saw my world turn black as I crashed down a long set of stairs into an inky dark basement.

“Ned, are you okay!?!?” Olivia yelled down at me.

I got up groggily onto my unsteady feet and yelled back. “I’m fine! You stay up there!”

I looked up at Olivia and the faint light that did little to illuminate the pitch-dark basement around me. However, I noticed that the stairs were splattered with blood. I felt a warm liquid run from my head and down to my cheek. I pressed my hand against it, and sure enough, it was blood. But it wasn’t mine. Tulio must have gotten hurt.

“Tulio! Where are you!? Are you okay!?” I yelled into the darkness. No response. I decided to follow the trail of blood. How the hell did he fall so far from the bottom of the stairs?

The basement was large. It wasn’t a trick of the darkness; it must have been an extremely wide room. The weirdest part was the strange, extremely intricate circles scattered on the walls, with markings and writings I couldn’t recognize or read. The pungent smell of rot grew stronger the further I walked into the basement. Then I neared the end of the trail, where I heard a strange noise—a wet popping and snapping. I could barely make out the figure of Tulio on the ground in a pool of blood, and... some sort of massive, fuzzy spider tearing away at him.

But it wasn’t a spider. The thing’s feathers slowly retreated, revealing those familiar intelligent eyes staring back at me. Even in the darkness, they were unmistakable—except this time, they were much larger. I barely had time to process the thing's appearance before it started to scream.

…I don’t think “scream” is the right word for it, though. The only way I can describe it is that it sounded like a large number of people—men, women, children—screaming simultaneously in a dreadful orchestra of collective agony, so loud that I could feel my very bones vibrate.

I covered my ears as hard as I could with my hands, my fear quickly transforming into terror. I ran back to the door faster than I had ever run. I could only have been running for a few seconds, but it felt like an eternity. The walls of the basement amplified the sound, making it feel as though it was coming from all around me. My vision began to blur, and the pain in my ears was unbearable. I thought my head might explode.

Somehow, in my disoriented state, I reached the stairs, but to my horror, I couldn’t climb them. Every step I took sent me crashing down face-first onto the cold wooden steps as the screams robbed me of my balance. My mind’s pleas to my body to stand and walk fell on deaf ears. I felt the unholy cacophony of voices grow closer... this was it. I reached out toward the light above and felt an arm grab me.

Olivia was pulling me up, yelling something that I couldn’t make out through the noise. I had to act quickly. My senses in disarray, I used all my might to perform the menial yet grand task of crawling up the stairs. I shut the door just in time and locked it firmly in place by resting my back on it. And then, silence. Olivia and I stared at each other in horror for a moment, but the silence was soon broken by slamming on the door.

“RUN!” I screamed at Olivia, and we bolted for the front door and out of the house to the yard. It was at this point I heard the basement door give way with a loud crash, and the birds began going crazy in response to the thing’s presence. I didn’t hear the sound of its pursuit. I didn’t know if it had even given chase, but I dared not turn around. Olivia and I were halfway across the road to my house when we heard the gentle voice of a woman.

“Olivia! Wait! It’s me!”

Olivia stopped running, and I turned back to yell at her not to stop, but it was too late.

What followed is something that will be burned into my eyes for the rest of my life. The thing loomed over Olivia. It looked like a person… but it was wrong. Its long brown hair, like that of autumn leaves, covered parts of its face, with patches of feathers across its sickly frame. Its elegant tail contrasted with the rest of its repulsive appearance. And those eyes… those same eyes of unspoken intelligence gazed down at Olivia. The eyes of a predator.

Olivia opened her mouth slowly... “Mommy—”

Then, in the blink of an eye, the thing leaped at Olivia, its jaw unhinging into a wide, terrible maw, baring long black talons down at her. I ran, not wanting to see what followed. I heard the sound of flesh tearing and bones snapping through Olivia’s muffled screaming.

I reached my house and barricaded the door as quickly as I could, gasping for air.

What the fuck is happening? I have to be going crazy; this can’t be real.

I cried, and my stomach rejected its contents as I threw up all over my living room floor.

I couldn’t just stay like this. I needed help—quickly.

I ran up the stairs to my room and grabbed my phone from my nightstand. I called 000 and told the operator there had been a murder.

“I’m sending help your way, sir. It seems you live in a rural area, so they may take some time. Please be patient and lock your—” The call cut out.

Hello?!... Great. Terrible service just when I needed it. At least I know help is on the way... I curled up against the wall with the shotgun I kept under my bed, praying to every god I knew that I wouldn’t have to use it, that I wouldn’t have to come face to face with that thing again. I tried my hardest not to think about the situation. I felt like I was losing my mind.

I waited... for what couldn’t have been more than 20 minutes, and then I heard them—police sirens. A wave of relief washed over me. They got here quickly… I’m at least an hour away from the nearest town, I thought, but I didn’t care. I was safe.

I rushed down the stairs and began to hear the chatter of radios and cars pulling up to my driveway. Then, a loud knocking at the door.

“Hello!? Sir!? We got your call. Is everything okay?”

Yes, hello! Thank you, God. I need help. My neighbor’s been murdered! I yelled at the officer through the barricade.

“Stay calm, sir. We’re here now. You’re safe. Just open this door so you can explain what happened.”

“Yeah, okay, give me a second...” I walked closer to the barricaded door to unblock it, but a sudden realization stopped me.

Where were the emergency lights? There was no light coming through the gap under the door. And the police had arrived far too quickly… something was wrong. My stomach began to sink, and unease crept in once again. I slowly stepped away from the door.

“Hello? Sir! You need to open this door so we can help you!”

What am I doing? Am I crazy? Help is on the other side of this door, so why won’t I open it? I just need to open this door and it'll all be over.

And yet, I found myself stepping farther and farther away from the door, away from the logical path to safety. Like some sort of primal fear was moving me on its own.

“SIR! OPEN THIS DOOR RIGHT NOW!” the police demanded.

Frustration welling up inside me, I yelled, “I’M NOT OPENING THE DOOR!”

And then it all stopped. The police chatter, the hum of the car engines, and the voices outside... all of it. All at once. My world became quiet.

I stood still, listening… The silence was unbearable. I had to do something, but... I didn’t know what.

“Ned.”

I jumped. Olivia's voice beckoned me from beyond the door. “Ned... are you okay? Please come outside. I need help.”

I felt my chest tighten, and my breath grew short. I needed to get away from that damn door.

I stepped backward, quietly, carefully, as the thing rambled on, posing as Olivia.

But I wasn’t careful enough.

The floorboards creaked beneath me, alerting the thing that its prey had caught on, and the path of least resistance was no longer an option.

I heard the thing groan and whine as if frustrated, and then it began to slam into the door.

Once.

Twice.

Three times.

The makeshift barricade held firm, but by now I was already upstairs, clutching the shotgun close and hiding in my closet.

It's been an hour since then. I don’t know where the hell the cops are, or if they're even coming. Every sound I hear feels like a trick, a lie. Maybe the call was a lie too.

A lie, huh? I bet everything Tulio told me was a lie too—about his city life, about just moving here, maybe even about his old job. Some neighbor he was, that bastard.

I still hear it pounding on the front door… yet moments ago, I heard a door on the second floor creak open. I don’t know how the hell it’s doing that.

I don’t know what to believe. I can’t trust my ears.

It's going to find me, but I’m going to fight back. I’m going to try and kill it. If you hear from me again, it means I was successful. This was the only place I could think to write this. And if I fail—if, god forbid, you encounter this thing—please...

 

Don’t fall for it.
