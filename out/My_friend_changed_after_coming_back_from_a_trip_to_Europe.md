You grow up hearing stories about vampires. They bite your neck and suck your blood, and oftentimes they turn you into just like them. Well, it’s not as simple as fiction claims. As I write this, I’m dangerously close to finishing my transformation, and, as much as I want it to stop, I can’t. So here I am, writing this while the shreds of my humanity still remain so none of you have to go through this yourself.

It all started with my good friend Alfie. We met in college and became close pretty quickly. Fast forward six years later, we were still close and we saw each other very often. I will admit, I had a crush on him for a while, but I had never done anything because I was pretty sure I wasn’t his type. Actually, if I were to be honest, I didn’t have very good self-esteem and I felt like I wasn’t pretty enough for him – or anyone else for that matter.

Back in June, Alfie went on a business trip to Europe. I didn’t remember which country, but I thought it was farther east. He was gone for two weeks, and then I went to the airport to give him a ride back to his apartment. Right then, I knew something was different. He looked paler, and he lost some weight (not that he needed to in the first place, unlike me). There was also something about the way he looked at me when he got in the passenger seat. It was still warm and friendly, but there was something else there that made me feel a little…vulnerable. Exposed. Naked. But I decided it was nothing as we started talking on the way to his apartment.

Once we got to his place, I helped him carry his luggage up to his unit. I then hugged him and was about to say goodbye so he could unpack and relax. Instead, he asked me to stay and watch a movie if I wasn’t too busy. I was a little surprised, so I asked if he was sure he didn’t want to rest. He said he missed me and wanted to spend time together. Then I noticed that…whatever it was…in his expression again, and I found myself saying yes.

We ended up watching a horror movie with vampires. I’m a pretty anxious person, but I do like horror; I just get really jumpy, and I often shriek at jump scares. Alfie knew this, and he usually made fun of me whenever that happened. Not tonight. The first jump scare had me fall over against him, and he grabbed hold of me. “You good, Bethy?”

“Yeah,” I breathed, feeling embarrassed.

He was still holding me against him, almost hugging me. I didn’t want him to let go, but I knew staying like this would’ve been ridiculous. I moved to get off him, but his grip tightened, keeping me in place. I looked up at him, confused, but he just smiled. “I don’t mind if you don’t.”

“N-not at all,” I stammered. His icy blue eyes bore into mine, and I couldn’t bring myself to look away. He had that look in his expression again, and it was making me antsy but not exactly in a bad way. Then I realized that he was moving closer to my face and, before I knew it, his lips were on mine. Alfie. Was. Kissing. Me. And it was honestly the best kiss I had ever had. The next thing I knew, he was carrying me off to his bedroom and my status as a virgin was no longer.

I woke up the next day feeling really warm. Alfie was cuddling me, both of us still naked. He had already woken up but was contentedly lying next to me. “Good morning, sleeping beauty.”

I yawned. “Good morning.”

“Was last night good for you?” He tightened his grip around my waist.

“The best.” I hummed slightly as he started pressing kisses along my neck. I turned around so he could kiss me on the mouth, and we ended up having sex again. After that, I got up and got dressed so I could get ready for work. Right before I left, I turned to look at him. “What are we?”

He smiled, still lying naked on the bed. “Anything you want us to be, love.”

I couldn’t help the smile that spread across my face. I went back to the bed to give him one last kiss. I almost regretted it because we started making out and he pulled me on top of him, as if we were going for another round. But I had to leave for work so I managed to pull myself away. “Later, okay?”

“Tonight?”

“Absolutely.” I gave him one last peck and left, feeling lighter than ever. In fact, I felt so light I could’ve sworn my clothes felt looser. They must’ve been stretched out when he was pulling them off me; he had been rather rough about it.

I ended up going back to Alfie’s that night, and we had sex again. The next morning, Alfie made me breakfast, and I was able to leave with a brief kiss and a full stomach. Our relationship continued, and I honestly was on cloud nine. I had never been so happy with someone in my life.

My best friend Dinah was getting worried, though. One day, we met up for lunch a month into my relationship with Alfie, and she said I looked sickly pale and that I lost a ton of weight in such a short amount of time. She wasn’t wrong; I ended up having to switch to a lighter shade of foundation, and my clothes were all sliding off my body. I went shopping for new clothes and found that I had gone down from size fourteen to size eight in a matter of one month. I went to my doctor, and everything seemed fine; I reported eating slightly less than I used to, but it wasn’t enough to explain the huge weight loss. My doctor ordered some labs and scans, in case something was wrong, but everything seemed to check out. No STDs, no cancer, no unusual blood levels, nothing. My pulse seemed to be slightly lower than average, but the nurse said that it was still fine for now. It was kind of scary not knowing what happened, but I was also relieved that I was skinnier.

A couple of weeks later, my lease was about to end, and Alfie suggested I move in with him, since I spent most nights at his place. It made sense financially, so I packed up my things at my old apartment and he helped me bring them over to his place. I hadn’t even started unpacking before he picked me up and took me into his – our – bedroom. It almost felt like we were married. I told Dinah (who also knows Alfie), and she was completely weirded out. “This is so out of character for both of you. Are you okay?”

“Never been happier.”

As time went on, the sex increased in frequency since we were actually living together. I was still losing weight; the clothes I had bought were getting too big, and the number on the scale continued going down. My skin was still getting paler, causing me to change foundation shades again. Everyone in my life was worried, except for Alfie. Not once had he commented on my weight, but I honestly appreciated him so much for that.

I know anyone reading this is concerned about my physical health by this point. Trust me, this is just the tip of the iceberg, though. Let me tell you what happened last week. We were making out when, right in the middle of necking, he bit my neck hard. It actually hurt, and I pushed him off. To my horror, blood was dripping from his now-pointed teeth. I felt my neck, and it was wet with blood. I stared at him, too horrified to speak. What was happening?

“Sorry, Bethy, love,” he said, slowly crawling back on top of me. I was too shocked to push him off again. “But it’s finally time. In one week, the process will finally be done.”

“Wha-what process?” I stammered.

“Why, to be like me,” he whispered against my ear. His tongue flicked out to lick it. “Bloodthirsty…lusty…young…healthy…for all eternity. Just like the creatures in that movie we watched when I took your innocence.”

“W-what?” I managed to get out. Vampires? Was he actually serious? But the more I looked at his…fangs, a heavy feeling of dread came over me. Holy shit, vampires were real, and my boyfriend was one of them.

“Haven’t you noticed anything different about me, Bethy, love?” he murmured, his lips ghosting along my jaw and travelling back down to my neck. He started licking up blood. “The pallor, the weight, the sex drive? Oh, but don’t worry, I’ve always been attracted to you. It just took two weeks of being seduced by a lovely woman in Romania to give me the courage.”

Romania! That was where his business trip had taken him! “S-seduced?”

“Seduced, love. Don’t believe what pop culture tells you. Vampires can’t just change you with one bite in one night.”

“Th-they can’t?”

“Of course not, love. There would be far more vampires in that case. No, no.” He finished with my neck blood and kissed the wound. “It depends on the human, but vampires need to spend a certain amount of time having…relations with them. You see, vampirism is like an STD. You get it through sex and blood. You have sex with the human enough times until they’re primed enough for the last stage of transformation. Then, you do what they always say vampires do and bite them. You get to feed on their blood and, in the process, insert your venom into the bloodstream. The transformation continues for one more week at a much more accelerated pace. You’ll start craving blood, you’ll get the ability to sharpen your teeth on command, and then your presence will become an aphrodisiac to humans who get too close to you. Except for the ones with incompatible sexual orientations. I myself could not attract a lesbian or a straight man even if I wanted to. Not that I wanted to. It was only you I wanted to take. For now, at least.”

“Wh-why me?” I whimpered. I wanted to push him off, but I was somehow still craving his touch, the feeling of him on top of me. Maybe, if he continued to fuck me, I could forget all of this was happening.

“Oh, Bethy, love,” he caressed my cheek, almost lovingly. “I told you I was attracted to you before the transformation, right? After the transformation occurred, my sire told me that since she already had her lifelong mate, I needed to sire my own. Vampires have this amazing keen sense of whom they’re meant to be with, and I knew right and there that you were the one.”

“What – what if I could stop the transformation from finishing?”

“No can do, Bethy, love. The venom’s in your system now. Now…time awaits, and then you’ll be young and healthy forever. Bonus: the sex will be much, much better. In the meantime…”

I was still horrified by everything I learned, but his vampire aura must’ve been an aphrodisiac, as he said, because I couldn’t help still wanting him. I let him fuck me over and over again until the sun came up. I missed a day of work, having to call in sick because I was so terrified of what was to come.

It’s now the night before the transformation is complete. I can’t stand human food anymore, and Alfie apparently has a secret blood bank stock that I can feed from. I can sharpen my teeth. I attract more attention on the streets than ever before, which strangely doesn’t bother me as much as I thought it would. It’s as if I know I have power over the creeps who catcall me or approach me for my number. I’m scared of this power, but I know I have no choice in taking it. I can only write this down while I’m still sane and before Alfie comes home. Please note that if any of you comment after 24 hours, I will not be able to respond as I will be full-on vampire by then. This account will be locked so vampire-me can’t delete this or terrorize y’all in the comments section.

Whatever you do, readers, if anyone in your life has these vampiric symptoms…

Do not fuck around.
