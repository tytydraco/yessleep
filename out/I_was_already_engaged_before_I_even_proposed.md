It's strange how quickly my life unraveled. Where I am now is comfortable, in a sense, but my body is decaying, breaking down by the second. I feel nothing but warmth—a smothering, all-consuming heat that I'd trade for an eternity in ice. Beside me lies my companion, peaceful and unchanging. She looks serene, her delicate features unmarked, but I can't share her stillness.

I should have thrown the ring away the moment it was given to me.

It started just a week ago.

For my twenty-first birthday, my father gave me the trip of a lifetime: a week in his homeland, all expenses paid. We grew up moderately poor until his import business suddenly flourished, something he never liked to discuss. My father specifically—almost desperately—wanted me to go. His hands shook as he handed me the plane ticket, though he tried to hide it. Looking back, I wonder if he had any choice at all.

My father had come to this country years ago and built a name for himself, creating a business that stood the test of time almost incredibly so. Where others failed, my father succeeded against impossible odds, like finding a needle in a haystack. Now I understand the true cost of that success.

My mother, innocent and proud of his achievements, helped me pack for the trip, suggesting places to visit and foods to try. She had no idea she was helping prepare for something that would take her son away forever.

When I said goodbye, my father hugged me for the longest time, as if afraid it would be the last. His grip was desperate, almost painful. I assured them I would be fine, but even though he smiled, I could see the anguish in his eyes. My mother stood beside him, happily waving, unaware of the weight crushing my father's shoulders. I couldn't shake the look he gave me as I left—like a man watching his world end. It's only now that I'm beginning to understand everything, now that I have nothing but my thoughts to accompany me.

I arrived at the hotel brimming with excitement, eager to explore the culture, food, and sights. The first day passed in a blur of vibrant markets and new experiences. Everything was perfect until the second day, when something began pulling at me, like an invisible thread tied around my soul.

By the third morning, I found myself inexplicably drawn to a shrine on the outskirts of the city. It was a long walk from the hotel, but my feet seemed to know the way, as if following a path laid out long before I was born. As I approached, I noticed people staring, their eyes filled with recognition and pity. An old woman tried to approach me, her eyes tearing up, but something seemed to frighten her away. That should have made me turn back, made me return to the safety of the hotel, but I didn't. Even though I noticed their strange behavior, they seemed like mere passersby at the time.

The journey there was pleasant and calming on the surface, but underneath, I felt a current pulling me forward. The path to the shrine was long, lined with lush greenery that seemed to whisper ancient secrets. Though the roads were confusing, something guided my steps unerringly to my destination.

At the shrine, I saw locals dressed in ornate, elegant clothing that seemed to belong to another time. When they spotted me, they were friendly, their smiles knowing. They spoke to me in my language, though their lips didn't quite match their words.

They were surprisingly willing to guide me, refusing any payment. The children who dragged me along had too-bright eyes and laughs that echoed strangely. Still, I followed, pulled by the same force that had brought me to this place.

Together, we explored the intricate architecture and watched a performance by locals dressed in traditional clothing. Their movements were fluid, their expressions serene, and the music felt otherworldly—because it was.

I must have arrived at the right time, though now I know there was no other time I could have come. It was always meant to be this moment, this celebration, this trap sprung by my father's past.

One of the women, her hair streaked with silver but her steps graceful as a dancer's, singled me out as the other locals danced. She pulled me into the circle, laughing as I stumbled through the steps. When the dance ended, she pressed something into my palm—a ring that felt warm, as if it had been waiting years for my finger.

The ring was silver, delicate, and strangely captivating. Its engravings were intricate, lines weaving into patterns I couldn't quite follow. I thought it was a gift for tourists, but it seemed too precious to just give away, so I assumed it was part of some ceremony. When I tried to return it, she grabbed my hand, her grip surprisingly strong. Her voice was sharp and unfamiliar, and though I couldn't understand most of what she said, she did clearly say, "You keep it." I stammered an apology, and her expression softened. She whispered something under her breath, then released me before kissing my cheek.

I should have pushed her away, but I didn't. I watched helplessly as she walked away, leaving me there.

I returned to the hotel, confused. In my room, I turned the ring over in my hands, marveling at how it seemed to catch the last rays of sunlight. I slipped it onto my finger, just to see how it looked, and was startled by how perfectly it fit.

I must have fallen asleep admiring it because the next thing I knew, there was a knock at the door.

When I opened it, a hotel clerk informed me that someone was asking for me by name. Confused, I followed him downstairs, and that's when I saw her.

She stood in the lobby, her presence both out of place and commanding. Her hair was dark as ink, cascading down her back, and her eyes were a pale, piercing gray that seemed to see straight through me. Her clothes, though faded, were ornate, similar to what I'd seen at the shrine but far more intricate.

When she saw me, she smiled—a small, enigmatic curve of her lips that made my chest tighten and my stomach churn. "You are...?" I managed to stammer, but she interrupted, saying my name in a soft, accented voice.

I couldn't understand how she knew me or why she'd gone to such lengths to find me. But her presence was disarming, and I couldn't bring myself to question her. Instead, I invited her to join me for breakfast.

Over the meal, we talked—or rather, she spoke, and I found myself hanging on her every word. She described her home, a place near the shrine, and her curiosity about the modern world. She seemed out of time, her wonder at the simplest things both endearing and unsettling.

When it was time to part ways, she hesitated. She looked lost, almost frightened, and when I asked if she had a place to stay, she admitted she didn't. Against my better judgment, I invited her to my room.

That night, she insisted on sharing the bed. I offered to take the sofa, but her quiet, pleading expression stopped me. Still, nothing happened. She simply lay beside me, her presence both comforting and unnerving.

By the next day, everything was hazy. My memories of the hours that followed blur together like a half-forgotten dream. She guided me back to the shrine that evening, her hand warm in mine. The old woman was waiting for us, her expression unreadable. She took the ring from my fingers and gave it to the woman. With a smile almost blindingly bright, she slid the ring back onto my finger.

Now I see her—the real her. Decay enriches her features; she looks more like a century-old corpse than the person she was, as the ring settles cozily on my finger. I want to scream but cannot. A smile rises on my lips as my words come out:

"I do."

If anyone finds me—if my parents come looking—tell my mother this wasn't her fault. Tell her my father did what he had to do, made the only choice he could. The success, the comfort, the life we had—it all came with a price. And it seems I was the payment. I know now why he looked at me the way he did. I now know he also didn't have a choice.

But I think it's too late for warnings or regrets. I feel it—the decay, painless but there. I want to scream, but a finger comes to my mouth, and I hear a whisper from the woman beside me, almost comforting:

"You are home, here... let's sleep, dear..."
