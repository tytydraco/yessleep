&#x200B;

As the ball lightning soared towards me, I came to life. It soared through the air with the speed of a cannonball. I heard the screams of Bear and Stephanie behind me, but it all sounded like an incomprehensible jumble. I jumped to the side, but it was far too late. The glowing ball of energy seared the flesh on my right arm. I smelled my skin cooking in its own fats. I landed on the ground as a bolt of agony shot through my body.

Bear had reloaded and sprinted forward towards the broken body of the creature. I raised my head and saw with horror that it had already started to heal. Tiny black veins like worms stuck out of the wounds on the creature’s head and legs, restitching the repulsive bony growths that composed its exoskeleton. They jumped and danced as they worked, the rounded ends of their tiny, leech-like heads performing a miracle before our very eyes.

The dark, fetid blood that gushed from the abomination on the ground had also started to slow significantly. As Bear ran towards it, I saw with horror that it had begun to try to push itself back up on its still-healing, shattered legs. It failed, stumbling like a baby deer taking its first steps, but I knew at the rate it was healing that it wouldn’t be long until its wounds were fully mended.

As Bear raised his .45 ACP pistol, ready to try to blow the creature away again, more green light began to form around its mouth and luminescent eyes. While Bear was preparing to fire at it, it had been preparing its own weapons in return.

Bear shot it point-blank in the face as pieces of the mass of light rippled into a cyclone. The bullet entered through its right eye. Like a jack-o-lantern being smashed, light poured from its ruined skull. The back of its head fragmented as bone splinters and pieces of flesh splattered the stone ground underneath it. The green light disintegrated. It felt like a flashbang had gone off. I was blinded by the overwhelming light that poured from its destroyed body. I also noticed a strange combination of smells- ozone mixed with the fetid reek of a slaughterhouse.

Bear stood there, panting heavily, his face covered in a thick layer of sweat. He looked down at the abomination on the ground. New veins and tendrils the size of a pencil reached out like fingers through the massive hole in its face. I looked down at my arm, wincing as I saw the deep wound. There was a charred, blackened spot about the size of an egg surrounded by patches of angry red tissue that spread out like groping fingers.

“How do we kill it?” I screamed, ignoring the pain. “What if it just keeps regenerating?”

“We should cut off its head,” Stephanie said calmly, a steely gleam in her eye. “Cut off its head and move it far away from the body, so that way they can’t rejoin.” She slung her backpack around and came up with a gleaming buck knife, its freshly-sharpened blade keen enough to shave with.

The creature still lived somehow. It had gone into some sort of seizure, kicking its thick, vampiric legs in violent jerking motions. I noticed it had thirteen fingers and thirteen toes, all crooked and inhumanly long. Sharp black claws grew out of the ends. It shook its head violently from side to side as if it were saying “No”, spattering its dark blood all over the floor and walls. I noticed how its blood glistened in the beam of the flashlights. It shone with oil rainspots, an iridescent pattern of colors gleaming as it streamed from the creature’s broken head.

“Are you sure?” Bear said, still hyperventilating. He looked at Stephanie standing there with the buck knife as if he had never seen her before. I must have given her a similar look. She had a sadistic pleasure in her eyes as she nodded grimly. She stood over the abomination’s writhing body, each one of her feet planted firmly on a side of its head, like a boxer standing victorious over his opponent after a knockout.

Bear and I each stood on one of the creature’s wrists so it couldn’t claw Stephanie out as she completed her grisly task. She knelt down, inhaling deeply. Then, without a moment of hesitation, she shoved the blade into the thing’s twitching neck. It gave an ear-splitting, demonic shriek as it spewed black blood like a fountain. Its jaw unhinged, and the dark blood flowed out of the center of the green electricity like a waterfall descending from an impenetrable mist.

But Stephanie kept cutting and slicing, her face a grim mask of determination. I heard a rending sound as its flesh tore. She had a problem with the spine, but, at least by that point, all the flesh had been sliced through and its movements had ceased. Its chest still rose and fell erratically. It gurgled as it choked on its own blood.

“Here, let me help,” Bear said, pushing her aside. With his thick arms, he twisted the creature’s head, which now only remained connected to its body by the vertebrae and a thin layer of gore around it. With a sound like a tree branch snapping, the head separated from the body. The green light brightened, faded to nothingness, then came back weakly for a moment before finally disappearing forever.

“Holy shit, that was intense,” I said, feeling like I was about to have a heart attack.

\*\*\*

Bear held the decapitated head in his hands, an uncertain expression on his face. The nightmarish visage seemed to stare up at him accusingly, the empty holes of eye sockets sunken and black in the bony face.

“What are we going to do with this?” Bear asked, shaking the ugly bastard for emphasis. I shrugged.

“Use it as a soccer ball, I guess…” I started to say jokingly, but my voice cut off as a soft, angelic singing reverberated down the hall. It was singing in some language I had never heard before, a resonant, humming language that nearly brought tears to my eyes with its beauty.

As the singing abruptly cut off, a figure came around the curving street. I saw it hovering over the ground. Enormous, leathery wings spread out on both sides of its body, extending fifteen or twenty feet in each direction. They ended in sharp points like the wings of a bat. Narrow bones ran along the lengths of the wings, supporting the dark webbing.

It wore a black satin robe with the hood pulled back. When I saw what it revealed, I gasped.

Its head was twisted around 180 degrees. The skin on the neck spiraled around in purple bruises. In the place of hair, it had dozens of writhing, black eel creatures with circular white eyes and dripping fangs. They snapped at each other like wolves fighting over food.

I watched as the approaching figure hovered towards us, feeling slightly hypnotized as the creature bobbed up and down like a buoy on a lake. It moved in a smooth, elegant way.

I stood there in a daze, hoping it would finish its song. I wanted so badly to hear that beautiful voice again. I glanced over at Bear and Stephanie. They both stared in open-mouthed wonder, Bear still clutching the decapitated head of the abomination under one arm.

But that little voice in the back of my head quickly pulled me out of my reverie as I realized that this was the Angel of Death. The Angel of Death glid through the air, its skeletal feet hovering a few inches above the ground. It would fall and rise slightly as it moved. As it got closer to us, the eel-like creatures growing from its scalp started to get more violent, snapping and gnashing their sharp teeth on the empty air, their jaws clacking together with a sound like a gunshot.

Stephanie was actually the first one to break out of the trance. She whispered as if afraid to draw the attention of the angelic abomination.

“There was a rule about this,” she hissed at us under her breath. “We need to cut ourselves and give an offering of blood.” I jerked like a man waking from a nightmare. The Angel of Death had closed in on us now, its face still looking away from us. But I knew without a doubt that it sensed our presence and had likely known we were there for a while.

As if to show us how it was done, Stephanie pulled her folding knife from her pocket and slid it across her palm, opening up a narrow slice that instantly began bubbling up with thin rivulets of blood. She held it up, letting it stream down her arm as the angel got within a few steps of us.

Bear and I quickly followed suit, flicking open our knives and raising our hands. I felt a quick, burning pain as I drew the knife across my palm, holding it up as the eel creatures snapped and hissed. Then she stopped, and the strange snake-like beings growing from her head went quiet. For a long moment, nothing moved. The silence seemed absolute.

“What do you seek?” she gurgled in a low, slowed-down voice. “Why do you foul this holy site with your mortal bodies?” I wondered how she saw us, unless she was able to see and feel through the eels emerging from her scalp. Actually, the more I thought about that, the more likely it seemed. If true, it meant she would be able to see in all directions at once. I imagined no one would ever sneak up on the Angel of Death- as if anyone would ever want to.

“We… we came here by accident,” Stephanie stuttered, stepping forwards as she spoke. “We seek a way out.” The angel went quiet for a long moment. The white cataract eyes on the eel creatures seemed to regard us with a strange intensity.

“What is that delicious offering under your arm, Son of Adam?” she asked. For a second, I had no idea what she was talking about. I couldn’t tell if she was talking to me or Bear. But the eel’s blank white eyes all focused on Bear, snapping to attention like dogs begging for a treat. They stopped their writhing and gnashing, going very still and looking at him for a long moment. I glanced over and saw he still held the decapitated head from the Mark of Cain abomination. He hesitated, looking uncertain. I nodded at him, urging him on. He held the head up high above his head.

“It is for you,” he said in a diffident voice. “We brought it for you as well as our offerings of blood.” The Angel of Death spun around, revealing a skeletal face with worms and larvae eating away at the rotting chunks of flesh still stuck to her cheeks and chin. Her eyes glowed with an inner white illumination like two pale stars spinning in the void. There were no physical eyes in her head, only these strobing and pulsing pits of blinding light.

“It smells… delicious,” she admitted, floating forwards slowly. Her decaying skull of a head drew within inches of Bear’s face. He flinched away, blinking rapidly. I could see him breathing fast as trickles of sweat ran down his face. I could smell the Angel of Death as she drew near- a smell like old leather and rancid meat. But underneath that, there was a sweet, pleasant odor, like an undertone of lavender.

“Your offerings are accepted. I will grant you a single boon for this,” the Angel of Death gurgled in a deep voice. She bent her face towards Bear’s bleeding hand and stuck her black tongue out. I looked at it with horror, seeing its putrefying sores and necrotic tissue. She used the fetid, rotting thing to lick the blood from his palm and wrist. I saw Bear shudder and go pale as her tongue ran over his skin. Then she went to Stephanie, repeating the bizarre ritual. Stephanie didn’t show a scrap of emotion during it, however. Then finally, the Angel of Death came to me.

Her tongue felt cold and soggy against my bleeding skin. Small pieces of the decomposing flesh and larvae were left on my wrist and hand as she moved up and down, sucking the blood caressingly, almost like a lover. I repressed an urge to vomit. My stomach did flips. After what felt like an eternity, she pulled away, spinning around and putting her claw-like hands out to Bear.

“Your tribute,” she demanded. Reluctantly, he gave her the head. Her arms bent backwards in a way that no human arm should bend, twisting and popping with soft cracking sounds. She threw the decapitated head up to the eel creatures growing from her scalp. They cracked open the bony exoskeleton with a sound like a walnut shell breaking open. It revealed the spongy, pink flesh underneath. It seemed infused with some kind of green growth, almost like tendrils of mold that ate its way through its brain and muscles. The eels quickly stripped it clean, sticking their pointy snouts in and snapping up the meat with rabid hunger.

“Mmmmm,” the Angel of Death said in a resonant voice that made her sound almost human. It was as if she could taste the meat and blood that the eel creatures stripped from the decapitated head. Perhaps she could. A chill ran down my spine.

After they had finished stripping the meat from the offering, their gnashing and writhing calmed down. She turned her face back to us and I saw, to my horror, that the offerings of blood and meat had revitalized her skeletal face somewhat. It now had fresh growths of pink skin around her cheeks, mouth and eyes. I heard Bear and Stephanie gasp in unison as they saw her regenerating face.

“Your boon,” she demanded impatiently, the bones now almost covered with new growths of skin that spread out over the rotten flesh underneath. I looked at Bear. He instantly nodded. We were all on the same page without having to speak it aloud.

“We want to know the way out,” Bear said, stepping forward and speaking in a loud voice. “We want to return home.” The Angel of Death nodded as if expecting this, the eel-like creatures on her head drooping lazily as if they were tired after their meal.

“The only way out is farther in, through the center,” she said. “But the true king of the bottomless pit will not let you pass without a struggle. His name is Abaddon, and he is a demon of the worst kind. His kind has always been against mine- since beginningless time, we have fought. For the followers of Abaddon wish to bring about the Apocalypse. They wish to unleash God from the bottomless pit, so that he can destroy his creation before fading into oblivion. They believe that, when the universe topples, they will become gods themselves. I believe Abaddon is insane, however. I do not know who promised him godhood, unless he promised it to himself.”

“And we must not look at his face, right?” I said, smirking. The Angel of Death nodded.

“Mortals must not gaze upon the face of Abaddon. It will melt the flesh off your bones if you do. There are things in the dark that are not meant to be seen by human eyes.”

\*\*\*

As the Angel of Death led us farther down into the pit, past more ancient towers and statues of angels with cruel, arrogant faces, I heard something far away. It sounded like people shouting and guns firing.

The Angel of Death floated above the ground in front of us, her backwards face always staring at us. It gave me the creeps. Her eyes never seemed to blink, and every time I looked up, I always found her staring right at me.

After a few minutes of traveling, she pointed to a dark side street with a long, skeletal finger. The stone road ran steeply down into darkness. It looked slick with moisture, and I saw a small subterranean stream flowing down the side of it. But as I looked closer, I realized the stream wasn’t water at all. The smell of copper and iron in the air was overwhelming as I knelt down, running a finger through it and pulling it up to see the red stain it left.

“Is this blood?” I asked, horrified. The Angel of Death did not answer me, but only continued to stare at me with her blank, dead eyes.

“The center is further down. Follow this road until the end. I wish you good luck, but I think I will see some of you again very soon. The last sands are flowing through your hourglass as we speak. So it is with mortals. Weak, pitiful things, they are. A mere breath of my power could destroy all three of you in an instant.” I couldn’t tell who she was looking at when she spoke these words, but they filled my heart with a sense of dread.

She drifted away slowly, almost lazily, hovering above the ground as she rose and fell in gentle waves, bobbing like a leaf in the wind. Within a few seconds, she had turned back down towards the dead city of Bloodstone, population zero.

\*\*\*

We quickly realized the source of the shouting and gunshots when some agents dressed in gas masks and tactical black SWAT uniforms sprinted towards us. They all had automatic rifles as well as dark green M67 fragmentation grenades attached to their belts.

They froze when they saw us, but they didn’t raise their guns. Their leader walked forwards, hesitantly looking each of us up and down without speaking.

“Sir?” one of the soldiers finally asked in the back after a few very long seconds.

“Let them go,” he said, motioning his troops on. “Not my fucking problem.”

“Wait!” Stephanie cried as they started to run away without giving us a backwards glance. “Are you with Agent Garland?” Their leader froze at the name, turning to face her.

“Yeah, we met your guy in the city of Bloodstone,” Bear said, keeping his hand near his holstered pistol.

“Look, I don’t know who you guys are, but shit is going downhill fast,” the leader said, his voice distorted and eerie through the gas mask. “We’ve lost most of our company down there. We are trying to call for reinforcements. I don’t know who you are, but you don’t belong here. Going down there is suicide.”

“Why are you calling for reinforcements? What’s so important that you would want to sacrifice the lives of your men and risk having even more killed?” I asked. His body stiffened.

“We’re trying to stop the Apocalypse,” he said, turning away and motioning for his men to continue following him. Within a minute, they were gone from sight around a bend in the steep, narrow tunnel. More gunshots echoed up from below. Bear and I looked at each other, exchanging worried glances, but Stephanie seemed unfazed.

“We need to keep going down,” she urged. “It’s the only way out.”

“I wish we had more weapons,” I said regretfully, following her down into the darkness below.

\*\*\*

After a few more minutes, the tunnel started to open up, the river of blood flowing into a swampy mess at the bottom. Strange, writhing vines twisted on its surface. Long, blood-red thorns spiraled around their thick stems.

A bridge made of bones led across the blood-red subterranean lake. I saw arm and leg bones stacked vertically, bound together with narrow strips of silver. Human skulls embedded in the bones formed a pattern, a symbol that seemed familiar. It looked like a backwards seven with a diagonal slashing line through it.

Across the bone bridge, I saw Agent Garland, his face sweaty and pale. He was surrounded by dozens of soldiers, some of them in gas masks and riot gear, others wearing plain black suits. All of them had automatic rifles, and most of them also had grenades and pistols as well.

“Agent Garland!” I cried. He jumped, spinning around and pointing his gun at me. When he saw my face, he lowered it.

“You goddamned idiots,” Agent Garland screamed. “You could have gotten yourselves shot! What are you even…” But his voice was cut off by a terrifying roar from behind him.

It sounded as if thousands of demonic voices shrieked together in a cacophony of alien tongues. It was a language of strange hisses, a language of hundreds of disparate voices screaming in low, slowed-down hisses.

“Another attack incoming!” a man in a black suit yelled, and the soldiers all turned away from us. Across the bridge, past the group of soldiers, I saw a tunnel that looked like a giant, hungry mouth with sharp stalactites and stalagmites sticking up and down like deformed, dripping teeth. An abyss of shadows cloaked the passageway, as dark as a midnight funeral. From the darkness, I saw silhouettes of creatures emerging that would have been at home in Dante’s Inferno.

There were more of the flying locust creatures we had encountered earlier, the ones with hairless child-like faces and dripping stingers. Their wings beat like helicopter blades, slicing through the air in a deafening cacophony. Their strange, white eyes seemed to change into expressions of pleasure and hunger as they drew nearer, their stingers dripping poison faster and faster as they got nearer to their prey. Dozens of them streamed forwards, grouped in packs of three and four flying in tight formation.

Behind these scorpion-like abominations, I saw something huge crawl out of the darkness, its skin the color of a black scab. The first thing I thought of when I saw it was of rat kings, when dozens or hundreds of rats get their tails intertwined and become, in effect, one body with countless skittering legs.

This was a conglomeration of many burnt, blackened bodies melded together with dozens of arms and dozens of legs sticking out of it. Multiple heads on top moaned in agony, their open, toothless mouths drooling blood and black fluid onto the burnt mass of skin below. Their lidless eyes had faded blue irises surrounded by bloody sclera. They constantly cried crimson tears.

These demonic conglomerations towered over the soldiers, each one fifteen or twenty feet tall. Their dozens of legs twisted in peristaltic waves, resembling the movement of some giant millipede. It propelled the entire mass forwards at a superhuman speed. I saw it scuttling towards us in a blur. And even though this happened years ago, I still see those abominations in my nightmares, and I regularly wake up screaming.

The agents opened fire. Bear pulled out his gun, and Stephanie and I took out our knives. My burned right arm shrieked in agony as I reached into my pocket.

&#x200B;

I didn’t know it at the time, but that would be the last time the three of us would stand together in this life.
