part 1.

My name is Alexander, and I have gone through a lot. It all began when I was a kid. Can I say just one thing? My parents were always as lovable as a family should be, but randomly one day, everything turned around. The day I met him, or, well, it, because there's no other word to explain that creature which decided to terrorize a small child.


It all began on a fully normal day. My friend Rasmus, a Swedish guy, and I played at our playground. We loved the game hide and seek, but we never could decide who would begin counting. We finally got together and decided that I would be the one to begin hiding. I ran away into the playground desperate to find a hiding spot when I saw something very weird‚Äîa poster on the side of the playhouse.


The letters were scrappy and looked old, talking about some weird naked man or a humanoid grey-skinned creature in the nearby village. It was wanted, and many people had gone missing after they'd seen this creature. The poster had three different small stories of what kids experienced. For example, most of them described the stories from the kids' eyes. The rest of the poster was probably written by the news photographer. Here's everything that was on it:

That was it. The poster gave me a slight chill down my spine, but I was curious. Then it hit me; it began to get dark. I shouted to Rasmus that I gave up, almost imagining that he would have been taken away by the creature. But to my happy realization, he shouted back, "Oh, okay," and ran up to me. I showed him the poster, and he got curious.

"Hey, should we try to find him?" he asked. "Are you stupid?! Absolutely not! He could be dangerous!" I said to him.


He looked down at the poster and then looked at me. He opened up and began saying, "Yeah, you're probably ri‚Äî" He got distracted by something. It seemed like he had frozen in place. At first, I thought he was joking, so I teased and said, "Huh? Whatchu doing?" No answer. I then realized that he wasn't looking at me; he was looking at the bushes some meters behind me. I turned around, and what I saw didn't freak me out in the beginning.


It was just a fleeting glimpse, a flicker of movement among the bushes. At first, I dismissed it as a trick of the fading sunlight, shadows playing tricks on my eyes. But then, I saw it again‚Äîa subtle shift in the foliage, like someone or something was lurking just out of sight.


Rasmus was still frozen, his gaze fixed on the mysterious disturbance. I felt a knot tightening in my stomach, a sense of unease settling over me. The air seemed charged with an otherworldly energy, as if the very atmosphere held its breath.


"Rasmus, let's go. This isn't right," I whispered urgently, but my words seemed to dissipate in the air, swallowed by the gathering darkness. He didn't respond; his eyes remained locked on the ominous rustling.


Against my better judgment, I took a step closer to the bushes. As I approached, the air became colder, and an unsettling quiet descended upon the playground. The poster's warnings echoed in my mind, but curiosity held me in its grip.


I peered into the shadows, squinting to discern any movement. That's when I saw it‚Äîa pair of glowing eyes, piercing through the darkness. A shiver ran down my spine as the creature revealed itself, its grey, humanoid form materializing from the obscurity.


It stood there, an eerie silhouette against the dimming twilight. Its eyes seemed to hold a knowing gaze, as if it could peer into the depths of my soul. Fear gripped me, but a strange fascination also took root.


Rasmus finally snapped out of his trance, his eyes widening in terror as he saw the creature. Without a word, we turned and fled, the creature's shadowy figure disappearing into the night. As we ran, the playground transformed into a maze of fear, every rustle of leaves sending shivers down our spines.


We reached home breathless, our minds reeling from the encounter. We both couldn't stop breathing hard. We weren't out of breath; we hadn't even run that far. We breathed loudly because of the creature. We couldn't get it out of our minds. But suddenly, a smile appeared on Rasmus's face.


"What‚Ä¶ did‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ HAPPEN!" he shouted excited. "We saw a naked dude. Or at least I hope he was human," I answered. "Nah, brother. Those eyes were shining yellow, and that mouth, no. Not from a human," he said. "But‚Ä¶ what was it then?" "I don't know. Do you know the legend of the rake?" he asked. "No. No, Rasmus. This creature had a completely different appearance. It was absolutely not the rake," I said. "No. Okay, that's true."


We chatted for a whole 4 hours about this thing. I tried to look happy, but just the sight of‚Ä¶ IT in my head got me wanting to cry. Rasmus needed to leave a little time later, and we said goodbye to each other, and I went to bed. I stayed awake all the way until 3 am. I was reading book after book after book, unable to sleep, but I finally fell into a deep sleep.


I woke up in the middle of the night. I didn't know why I woke up. Yeah, sure, sometimes you can wake up by yourself, but I was sure that something woke me up. The more time that went on, the more awake I got, and the more I thought that "no. Something woke me up," and then it came to me‚Äîthe window. I glared at the shadow that the light outside made up, and I saw movement. And then, out of nowhere, a long arm with sharp fingers grabbed the side of the window. I later saw the same shape I saw at the playground in the shadow. It was him. It was it. The enigmatic figure from earlier.


My heart raced, and a chill ran down my spine as the creature's elongated fingers crept into view. I lay frozen in my bed, unable to look away from the nightmarish silhouette that haunted my window. The room seemed to close in on me, and the air felt heavy with an oppressive stillness.


In that moment, I wished for the safety of daylight, but the oppressive darkness outside seemed to conspire against me. The creature's eyes, now a piercing yellow, locked onto mine, and an unnatural hush settled over the room. It was as if time itself had halted, leaving only the distant sounds of my frantic heartbeat.


Fear and curiosity waged a battle within me. I was terrified, yet drawn to the mystery of this unearthly being. The poster's ominous warnings echoed in my mind, urging me to report all sightings anonymously, but the allure of unraveling the secrets overshadowed reason.


Summoning every ounce of courage, I slowly approached the window, compelled by an inexplicable force. The creature's face came into clearer focus, revealing an unsettling blend of humanoid features and otherworldly attributes. Its eyes held a haunting intelligence, and its mouth twisted into a grotesque semblance of a smile.


I couldn't tear my gaze away as the creature began to communicate without words. Images and emotions flooded my mind‚Äîvisions of hidden realms, ancient mysteries, and a connection that transcended the boundaries of understanding. It was as if the creature sought to convey a message, a cryptic narrative that left me both bewildered and captivated.


Abruptly, the spell was broken as the creature recoiled from the window, retreating into the shadows. The room returned to normal, and the weight in the air lifted. I was left alone in the darkness, grappling with the surreal encounter.


Morning sunlight eventually pierced through the curtains, bringing a semblance of normalcy to my surroundings. I questioned the authenticity of the previous night's events. Was it a vivid dream or a manifestation of an otherworldly reality? The poster at the playground had hinted at an ongoing investigation, and I couldn't shake the feeling that my life had become entwined with something beyond comprehension.


This was the first meeting of hundreds throughout the year I had with it. Every night it came back, and we repeated every meeting over and over again. After a month of these meetings, I got really scared and decided to tell my parents. My parents thought that I must have gone crazy. Every night, I ended up shouting for my parents. Then, one night, my true nightmare occurred.


I was ready for our normal meeting and just waited in my bed, but he never came. Hours passed by, and nothing happened. I thought everything was over. But now, is when the real nightmare happened. I noticed why he never came to my window‚Äîit was because he was under my bed. My curiosity disappeared fully, and I lay there terrified.


How do I know he was there, you ask? Because I heard a growl from beneath me, and I started seeing images in my head again. As usual, he tried to message something to me. This time, the images were of me. I saw each image, a photo of me laying on the ground without a head, and the creature next to me smiling with red substance that I believed was blood dripping from his mouth and his sinister smile. I just had one thought in my head.


Could I escape?


I got two scenarios in my head. What if I were fast and were able to turn on the lights? Would I be able to escape? But then the thought of me moving would set off the creature to fly onto me, killing me there and then.


What if I grabbed the glass on my nightstand table and threw it in a corner? Would it attack the glass, just giving me time enough to escape? And then the thought of the creature seeing through my bluff and attacking me instead grabbed my head.


Then something weird happened. I noticed something grabbing my leg. Four claws that twisted into my leg, and I felt blood running down my leg. It had me. It had grabbed my leg while I was thinking about how to escape it.


It heard my thoughts. It knew what I was planning. And now I only knew one thing. Either I wait for the sunrise and risk being ripped apart by IT, or I run for it to the light switch and risk being caught by it. I felt terrified, with the thought of death in my head. Then I noticed something. The creature started roaring; it jumped up from under my bed, jumping around in what seemed like it was growling in pain.


The creature's agonized roars reverberated through the room, and I could see its shadowy form convulsing in apparent distress. The images of my demise faded from my mind as the creature thrashed beneath my bed. I clutched my injured leg, feeling a mix of fear and confusion. What had caused this sudden change in the creature's behavior?


With trembling hands, I fumbled for the bedside lamp, desperately seeking a source of light. As the room illuminated, the creature recoiled, its grey, humanoid features contorting in discomfort. The glow of the light seemed to repel it, creating a small sanctuary around me.


In that brief moment of reprieve, I seized the opportunity to scramble away from the bed, my eyes fixed on the creature's writhing form. The pain in my leg intensified, a stark reminder of the creature's earlier grasp. But the urgency to escape overshadowed the physical discomfort.


I reached the light switch, hesitating for a moment as I debated whether the creature's aversion to light was real or merely a temporary reaction. The creature, sensing my hesitation, emitted a guttural growl, a warning that echoed through the room.


Summoning courage, I flipped the switch, flooding the room with brilliant light. The creature let out a high-pitched screech, shielding its eyes from the brightness. It retreated further, dissolving into the shadows as if repelled by an invisible force.

 
My heart pounded in my chest as I stood there, panting and bewildered. The room, once a battleground of fear, now basked in the safety of light. The creature let out its highest roar before darting into a dark corner, appearing as frightened as a cornered dog. It curled into a ball, and despite my initial fear, a twinge of sympathy tugged at me. Ignoring better judgment, I approached it, eager for a closer look.


Within a meter, it slowly lifted its head, and I found myself locked in the piercing gaze of its yellow eyes, glowing with rage. Its mouth dripped with a red substance, and with a sudden burst of energy, it leaped out of my window and vanished into the night. Only then did I notice the pain in my leg, and a scream escaped me when I saw the sizable bite mark ‚Äì a chunk of flesh missing.


My parents rushed into the room, their own horror mirrored in their expressions as they beheld the gruesome sight. We endured one more month in that house before relocating. Fifteen years had passed since that harrowing encounter, and it was far from the last time I would cross paths with that mysterious creature.


but The story has grown longer than anticipated, and family duties call. Until next time, I bid you farewell ‚Äì duty beckons, and tonight, I must protect my family from IT. Wish me luck.
