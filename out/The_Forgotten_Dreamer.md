Dr. Samuel Reed adjusted his glasses as he scanned the file in front of him. The latest subject, Daniel Holt, had checked into the Institute for Sleep Research three nights ago, suffering from chronic insomnia and vivid nightmares. The experimental treatment involved deep sleep stimulation—a method designed to enhance REM cycles through low-frequency brainwave induction. The project had shown promise in preliminary trials, but Daniel’s case was unique. His insomnia had worsened over the past year, and none of the conventional treatments had helped.

Dr. Reed glanced at the clock. 11:45 p.m. It was time.

"Are you ready, Daniel?" Dr. Reed asked, his voice calm yet clinical. He had conducted this experiment multiple times before, but something about tonight felt different.

Daniel nodded hesitantly. "Yeah… I guess." His voice wavered, betraying the nervous energy beneath his composed exterior. He adjusted his position on the hospital-like bed in Room 306, exhaling shakily. The sterile white walls, the constant beeping of monitors, and the scent of antiseptic made him uneasy. He had always hated hospitals.

A nurse, Clara, approached with a clipboard. "Just relax, Mr. Holt. We’ll monitor everything. If anything feels off, we’ll be right here."

Daniel gave a weak smile, but deep down, he wasn’t so sure. His nightmares weren’t just bad dreams. They felt real. Too real. He had woken up screaming on multiple occasions, drenched in sweat, unable to shake the feeling that something had followed him back from the dream world.

Clara gently placed a set of electrodes on his temples, pressing them into place with careful precision. "All set. Dr. Reed, we’re ready."

Dr. Reed tapped a few commands into the terminal, and the overhead lights dimmed. A low-frequency hum filled the room as the sleep-inducing machine powered up, its rhythmic vibrations syncing with Daniel’s brainwaves.

"I need you to take slow, deep breaths," Dr. Reed instructed. "Let yourself drift."

Daniel did as he was told. His eyelids felt heavier with each passing second. The room faded into a blur. The last thing he saw was Dr. Reed scribbling something in his notes, his face unreadable.

As the sedation took full effect, Daniel's body relaxed completely. His heart rate slowed. His breathing became deep and even. The monitors registered stable readings.

But then… something changed.

A flicker on the screen. A brief surge in brain activity. A spike that shouldn't have been there.

Dr. Reed frowned, his fingers tightening around his pen. "That’s unusual…" he muttered.

Clara leaned in. "What is it?"

"His readings are off the charts. I’ve never seen brainwave activity like this before. It’s as if… he’s entering a REM state faster than normal."

The monitor beeped faster. Daniel’s eyes darted beneath his eyelids, his fingers twitching.

"Increase observation frequency," Dr. Reed ordered. "Let’s see how deep he goes."

Clara nodded, adjusting the settings on the machine.

Inside Daniel’s mind, something shifted. He felt like he was falling—faster, deeper, through an endless tunnel of darkness. Distant whispers echoed around him, voices he couldn’t understand. Then, just as suddenly as it began, the falling stopped.

He was standing in a room.

But it wasn’t Room 306.

It was a small apartment, dimly lit by the flickering glow of a neon sign outside the window. The hum of city traffic drifted in. A coffee table sat in front of him, covered in scattered papers and an empty whiskey glass. A framed photograph rested on the table.

He picked it up.

The picture showed a man and a woman, smiling. The man looked… familiar. Daniel's heart pounded as he traced his finger over the image. It was him. But not him.

The woman in the photo? He had never seen her before in his life.

Then, from behind him, a voice whispered.

"James… you’re home."
