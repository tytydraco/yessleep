The next thing I knew, I was in a cave of some sort, lying down. The cave looked like it had been just settled, with items strewn haphazardly around on the bare, rocky ground without any semblance of a layout. Just one detail was distinguishable: A pink sign hung from the wall, with ‘Aurora’ spelled out in gold calligraphy lettering.

Oh, and where was I lying down?

As I looked up, I realised that my head was lying on Aurora’s lap. She looked somewhat different though, as I only just noticed that her face was laden with make-up. Of course, while she made us struggle, she had time for a beauty makeover.

“What the hell?!”, I exclaimed in shock as I tried to get up. I then realised that my hands and feet were tied together, and I could not move.

“Hey dear!” Aurora brightly greeted me. “Awake now?”

“Don’t call me that”, I croaked, my voice hoarse from what was probably hours of rest and no water.

“Whatever, Margaret. Anyways, want to hear a story?”

“No.”

“No? Wrong answer. I don’t care about your willingness anyways, you’re stuck in here with me!”

Well, she was right.

“Once upon a time, there lived a girl with four loving parents. Of course, they were controlled by an organisation.”, she practically spat out the word. “But regardless, they loved her, took care of her, taught her everything she wanted to know about the wide world.”

“One day, she went snooping around in places she wasn’t supposed to be in. In corners of her very own home, corners which she was told to avoid. By the parents. And guess what she found?”

“What?”, I nervously asked. Now, there were storage areas and labs we forbade her from going into, so this question made me incredibly nervous.

“This!”, she said, holding up a triangular flask of black liquid. 

“What’s that?”, I asked.

“Don’t play stupid!”, she snarled, before returning back to the story.

“That day, she found a liquid in a glass jar. Labelled ‘mind agent AX-V45’. Of course, the girl was curious. Very curious. So the very same day, she opened the computer of one of her parents. The girl, you see, was very smart, and realised that the password was her own name with 123 added behind it!”

Well, knowing what I knew then, it sounded plausible.

“She went to the organisation’s database, and looked through the notes for that liquid. Turns out, when it’s injected into someone, within an hour their mind is completely under your control. To heed your every command. Like what I did with your Sam here.”

“What?”, I asked, horrified. “Is this what happened to Sam? Is this why he helped kill Raj?”

“Yes. That’s what I did.”, she confirmed.

“And the girl continued reading. And reading. And reading. And at the end, she found a damning note, written the previous day. ‘To be used on subject 5, 17/11/18’. And that’s when she realised that it was to be used on her. To take away her personality. To leave her dancing to the whims of OTHERS!”, she screamed, her voice echoing off the bare rock walls of the cave.

“Of course, she bided her time, while hatching a plot to escape. Day by day, she planned and planned and planned. And on the planned date to control her, she decided to give them a little gift of their own.”

“The cupcakes?”, I asked.

“Very good! You’ve been paying attention, then.”

“But we didn’t have any such plans for you!”, I retorted. And I meant it, for she was not subject 5.

“Whatever. Anyways, she ran from the place that she called home for her entire life. Oh, her parents came running to stop her! But the girl was smart and strong. Smarter and stronger than the people who chased after her!”

“And in the chase, she found freedom. And soon, she wanted lots of freedom. Lots and lots and lots of it!”

“She wanted a chance to grow, to thrive, to live her life to the fullest. And above all, she desired POWER! But first, she had to find the organisation.”

“And oh, their agents and moles were everywhere. Of course, they underestimated the girl. And the girl, she found those little rats one by one, and she siphoned off all the resources they had. Money, underworld people, weapons, everything! Eventually, from afar, she destroyed them, ripped apart their labs and centres, and danced on the ashes of their destruction! They didn’t. Stand. A damn chance!”

“And that’s how right now, at this very moment, the girl has broken the shackles of her past life as a *lab experiment*.”, she ended the story, practically snarling the last two words.

“How’s the story?”

“It’s a terrible fucking story!”, I yelled, finally finding my voice.

“Regardless, I don’t care. Anyways, I’ll be keeping mom — I mean, your Diana. And your Sam is fully mine now.”

“And, well, I need an external observer who will see my eventual success. To tremble in my wake! And that’s why you are going to be let go.”, she said as she untied me.

“Let… go?”

“Yes! I have some people ready to bring you back home. After this, you’ll probably lie low anyways. See you never, then!”, she explained before bringing me outside. True enough, there was a helicopter with green, yellow and blue stripes, probably a military helicopter. Inside, five people wearing Indian military fatigues jumped out.

“A patrol reportedly went missing last week. Of course, they weren’t missing. They were found by me! Ha ha!”

The men ushered me into the helicopter on the cliff, and the rotors began beating as the helicopter rose. 

“Bye dear!” Aurora called out after me. I opted not to respond to her, happy to be away.

Multiple planes later, I was back in sunny Florida. 

All of this is not recent, rather, it happened four years ago. I could have gone back, maybe moved to the region to observe Aurora. But I’ve always been a coward, no matter what facade I put up. Instead, I simply moved back to my hometown in Georgia, picked up a couple part-time jobs here and there, subsisted on my savings and put my head down. I simply didn’t have the will to do anything else.

A few times, I did try to contact the corporation by calling them, hoping I could make some sense of things, but I received no response. Once, I even mustered up the courage to drive back to our Miami lab, but I didn’t find anything there. The building was left abandoned, and the equipment was broken and scattered everywhere.

So, why am I telling you guys this? Well, I just got an update.

A few days ago, I got a message from Diana’s number. While I changed my number and haven’t really been keeping in contact with them, I knew her number by heart. When I opened the message, a video was attached. Of course, I watched the video, wanting to know what was up.

In the recording, Aurora stood on a mountaintop looking down on an isolated valley. While this was not the same place I last saw her in, it must have been somewhere in the nearby Himalayas. The valley was jam-packed with people of all races and genders, and most people were teenagers and adults with a few smaller children here and there. If I had to estimate, there were maybe upwards of three thousand people there. All of them were bustling about, carrying little metal devices and other items here and there.

All of them had the same distinguishing feature, though. Their eyes looked rather… dead.

So all I’m saying is, something big is going to happen soon. I tried my best, but I couldn’t stop it. Be prepared.
