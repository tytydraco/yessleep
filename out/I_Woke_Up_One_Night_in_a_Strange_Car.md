All I did was fall asleep on the toilet. It was in one of those mucky middle of nowhere gas station restrooms and I needed to take a crap, but I was feeling ill, and I didn’t have any spare change for coffee at 2 in the morning about 50 or so miles away from home. The gas station was being operated by an old Hispanic lady at the counter, so I figured that I’d be alright to doze off for a bit and wait for that lady to wake me up when she inevitably came into the restroom to clean it.  
  
   I was wrong to assume that though, and not because of the probability that she never came into that room since the place looked like it hadn’t seen a mop and disinfectant since Kurt Cobain blew his brains out.   
  
   When I woke up, the first thing I felt was an insufferable throbbing headache, and my ass rubbing against jagged and torn leather, because my pants were still down to my feet. I couldn’t see anything at first, but I knew immediately from the humming of some troubled sounding V8 and the rough undulating of my surroundings that somehow while I was passed out I had been dragged from the gas station and was now riding in some stranger’s car. Maybe not the weirdest thing to happen to me whilst traveling through the desert, but jarring nonetheless.   
  
   I realized I was in the back seat of the car when I put my hands forward to feel the back of the passenger seat, and I could see the lights of the dashboard coming from the gauges up front, though I couldn’t see the lights from the center of the dashboard with the radio and A/C. The driver of the car was a completely dark silhouette that I wouldn’t even be able to tell was there if it weren’t for the dashboard lights, the cigarette that was lit in his right hand lying on the center console, and the shadowy figure of his left hand gripping the steering wheel.   
  
   Though I was unsettled by this change in surroundings, I didn’t really feel as though I was in any kind of danger, since otherwise I’d be sideways in the trunk all tied up with rope and tape over my mouth (which I’m well familiar with). I attempted to get the driver’s attention. “Hey! Who are you? Where the hell am I? I’m gonna be really pissed off if you didn’t wait for me finish shitting myself before dragging me into this goddamn thing.” I already was kind of pissed off since I hadn’t gotten the chance to wipe before I fell asleep, and I could still feel the consequences of that. . .  
  
   The driver didn’t respond however. He kept staring dead ahead without a single flinch into the abyss, speeding forward through a darkness so intense that not even the headlights of the car could penetrate. That was the most frightening thing of all, because earlier when I was driving myself it was one of those picturesque nights in the derelict part of the country where the sky and the ground were both being illuminated by the stars and the moon. Now, no matter how much I tried to squeeze my eyes into adjustment, I couldn’t see a damn thing out of the window.  
  
   I couldn’t see what the speedometer was saying, but I could tell by the pitch of the gurgling engine and the intensity of the car’s rocking motion that we were moving pretty fast. “Hellooo??” I blurted out at the man again. I felt for the red button that’s supposed to eject the seatbelt buckle, but when I found the button, it was completely jammed. I was locked in place. “Um. . . .can you at least pull over and undo this seatbelt so that I can get my ass off this seat and put my pants back on?”. Still no response from the man. “. . . .I mean it’s. . . .hell it’s not like I can just run off through the desert. Who am I gonna ask for help, the vultures?” I said, getting the impression that the man still thought of me as just one of those scummy coward thugs who’d kill a whole family before I’d let anything bad happen to myself.  
  
   “. . . .Oh believe me. . . .”, the man finally said before taking a drag off his cigarette, “You’re way better off in here than out there. . . .”. The man then took his cigarette over the passenger side of the car, the ashes still glowing, and flicked the ashes off into the footwell.   
  
   I knew that I had no right to argue with someone who would be insane enough to drag some seeming nobody into his own car and as a result probably outgunned and outwitted me, so in response to his statement I simply laid back in my seat with a sense of inadequacy, and stared back to my left where the window was, and it was all still pitch black. My head, still throbbing with a tremendous headache, was swirling with the thoughts of who this man was and what he planned to do with me, and I thought about what I would do if I somehow made it out of this situation alive and how I would explain to the boys in Pie Town that I spent several hours with my ass exposed in the backseat of the boogie man’s rotten old sedan without them thinking that I had fucked around with my drug collection whilst traveling. . . .again.   
  
   “. . . .How about some music?. . . .” Said the man spontaneously, and then he reached into the glovebox and pulled out an 8-track which I couldn’t see the label of in the darkness. He then said, “I could go for some noise right about now”, before inserting the thing into the darkness of the dashboard. What began blasting from the crunchy speakers of the car was what I could only describe as a caterwauling cacophony of rock instruments playing alongside multiple bellowing vocalists shouting impromptu gibberish.   
  
   That’s not what bothered me though. What bothered me was that this was one of MY songs. In my youth when I was still with my high school friends, we decided that one day, when the mayor imposed some toothless noise regulation on our neighborhood, that we would form our own little garage band in an act of rebellion called “Dissonance”. The one song that we “wrote” was exactly what the name of the band implied. Borrowing equipment from the local college with the help of older friends, we settled into my garage and organized all of our instruments; each with our own microphone for us to vocalize. Then on the count of three we would use our instruments and our voices to strum and bash and scream a supreme shockwave of sound throughout the entire damn neighborhood.   
  
   We never recorded the song though; it was just one of those neighborhood anomalies that we never committed to recreating again when all the neighbors came bashing at our doors. So, realizing that the  
man had just pulled out a fucking 8-track of a song of mine that should be more lost and forgotten by the world than the whereabouts of J. J. Harding’s 157^(th) toe-nail clipping, I was actually starting to get somewhat frightened by this man.  
  
   “How the hell do you know about this song!?” I said, yelling over the speakers which were blasting my ear-raping song at full volume, “Where did you get a recording of this!?”.  The man ejected the cassette from the player and said, “I guess I was just in the right place and the right time. . . .”, and then I said, “You’re freaking me the fuck out man, what do you mean by that?”  
  
   At this point, since I started to sense that he was willing to converse with me, and at that point I was completely losing my cool, I started bombarding him with repeated questions like some overbearing news reporter. “Would you shut the hell up?” He finally responded in a scolding tone of voice. “What I mean is, I was there to witness all of it. . . . To watch the whole shit-show unfold.” I barked back at him, “How? I didn’t see your ass around anywhere when we were doing that, I don’t fucking know you man!”   
  
   “Well then, you slewy chicken-shit bastard. . . .let me shed some light on the matter for you. . . .” He reached his hand up to the roof of the car and turned the roof light on. My heart sank as I saw just how dirty and rotten the interior of the car was. Where there was once the plush and lustrous red leather interior of a classic Ford Galaxie was now a filthy metal cage, battered and torn by the rage of some suppressed rabid animal. In every corner of the car were cobwebs and rat nests of varying sizes, which were tucked behind piles of lousy woman clothing, beer bottles, ammunition boxes, lottery tickets, and many, many old receipts. . . .   
  
   That's not what bothered me though. What bothered me is that this was MY car, and I was responsible for everything; every last speck of dirt. . . . I looked up at the driver, and was horrified to see that he was still completely pitch black despite the luminosity of the light above him. I couldn't even begin to process everything that I was seeing as I slowly turned and tilted my head towards it all. As I felt the crushing weight of hopelessness mashing and churning at my soul I screamed and thrashed all around me, but it was as if the abrasive seatbelt seemed to firm it's grip on me the more I struggled.

"You better try to get comfortable back there, cause it's gonna be a looong ride. . . ."
