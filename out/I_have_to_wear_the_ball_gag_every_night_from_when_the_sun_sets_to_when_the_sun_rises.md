My demonic predicament's been going on for a week now.

On that day one week ago, I could have sworn I had sleep paralysis. I had no idea how to move. As I lay in bed helplessly, *he* came. *He* appeared before my eyes, and *he* had an appearance that was scary enough that it'd make you think of Freddy Krueger, but with horns.

I desperately wanted to wake up from it, hoping it was merely a nightmare.

*He* put the finger to his lips. I desperately tried to scream myself awake. And yet I could not scream. *He'd* disabled my voice temporarily.

And this is what *he* said that night, in a tone of voice that was ethereal, creepy, and like many voices. The voice reminded me of the Candyman from that horror film.

*"From sunset to sunrise. Keep it strapped. Do not take it out, for you may draw your end ever closer. This shall be the norm, from this day forth, for all eternity."*

I was still unable to move, but I felt something different. As I tried to speak, scream, *something* to figure out if my voice still worked, it sounded quieted.

It dawned on me that *he* put on me whatever it was.

The next morning. I woke up feeling something off. As I went to the bathroom to take a leak and then take a shower, I noticed something in the mirror that was somehow *different*.

I decided to take a closer look at my reflection. I nearly hit my head on the floor from jumping at what I saw.

A ball gag had been strapped onto me.

I looked out the bathroom window, and found that I was up real early. My clock read 5:00 a.m.

I unstrapped that strange ball gag, hoping I was just pranked and that I just had a sleep paralysis nightmare.

Major mistake. My mirror reflection changed dramatically. I looked... haggard and burned beyond recognition.

I wanted to scream. But then my reflection *moved*! It fucking moved on its own!

I was about to run out the bathroom when *he* came again. I was frozen in place. Unable to move.

Then, *he* touched me. *He* turned my body towards the mirror. Then, my horribly distorted reflection moved again on its own.

Blood poured from its eyes when it brought out what looked like a bloody and rusty cleaver. It got ready to cut. I was both paralyzed from fear and from *him* when it just swung the cleaver down, and all it did was hit the sink.

I was so sure it was going to cut a part of me off.

*"Two seconds and you already break the rules. Consider this a warning. Next time, I won't let you off so easy. Wait until the sun rises."*

And then *he* disappeared, and my reflection went back to normal, almost instantly after *he* finished saying *his* little spiel.

But the ball gag had been strapped back onto me. Again.

I turned off the bathroom light, and looked out the window. Still dark out. I turned on the light again, and undressed to take the shower. Then, while I felt the relief of the hot water hitting my body, I kept looking out the window, hoping the sun would just hurry up and rise.

&#x200B;

The sun rose after about an hour while I was in, and then I got out and got ready for the day. I was sure that the sun would have to fully be in the sky before I could unstrap that thing, and I was about to get to the kitchen when *he* showed up again, paralyzing me again.

I decided to try thinking to *him*, to see if *he* could hear me from that.

I thought, "Would you please not paralyze me so suddenly? You made me jump!"

Then *he* spoke again.

*"The sun has arisen. You may now take it out. Remember, Dorian, that you must put it back on when the sun sets over the horizon, lest your end be drawn closer."*

&#x200B;

I went to the office. I'm in my company's Accounting department. In the break room, I was going to tell the coworkers about what I experienced the previous night when I suddenly couldn't move, again. And right as I was going to pick up my coffee cup.

*"Dorian, it must be kept a secret. Should any other person learn of me, that will also draw your life's end ever closer."*

I was awoken after *he* left, and my coworker and only friend Skye had a hand in getting me to move again.

"Dorian! Are you alright?"

"Yeah, Skye. I don't know what happened. I was--"

"Frozen in place? This is very unusual. Do you think you can go to a doctor?"

"I don't think I need a doctor at this point, Skye."

"Well, if anything gets worse, call me. I'll get you to the hospital."

I could trust Skye more than the police and the firefighters and so forth. She is my inexpensive alternative to the ambulance. I have a family history of cancer, so I have to go to the hospital sometimes for cancer checks.

By the time I was finished with my work for the day, I realized I hadn't watched the clock.

*"Dorian. Do not fret. It is in your pocket. Strap it on, now."*

I tried thinking to *him* again, while I was frozen in place.

"But I worked overtime. Won't the others notice when I put it on?"

*"Strap. It. On!"*

My reflection in the monitor of the computer, which I had turned off, began to move by itself. And it looked worse than when it was in my bathroom mirror.

"I need to move to strap it on. Could you let me move?"

*"The sun has just begun to set. Do not worry, you can move. Put it on. Now."*

Then my computer's reflection held the same rusty cleaver. It held the weapon high, like it was going to do something with it.

And as it semi-climbed through the monitor, I noticed that it looked bloodier, its skin looked more dissolved, like something out of a horror film. I was about to scream in terror.

It was just about to swing down the rusty cleaver when I moved my arms quickly out of the way.

And I felt around my overcoat pocket, and sure enough, that weird ball gag was there.

*"Good, Dorian. Now strap it on. Right now."*

And as I was going to, I was looking around to see if anyone was noticing what the fuck was going on.

*"Do not worry. Our secret will be kept. Dorian, I have something for a situation like this."*

And then I felt something manifest in my suit coat pocket. I was about to search it when *he* spoke to me again.

*"Strap it on first. Then, I will assist you."*

I could no longer hold myself back as I was doing from fear, and I went under my work desk and just strapped that ball gag onto myself. I was sweating, as though my whole body just became the plaza fountain.

Then *he* crept up to me. Because I'd been paralyzed again, I wanted to scream. Then, *he* put *his* hand in my suit coat's pocket and pulled out what looked like a KN95 mask.

And *he* then put the mask on me.

*"Go. You will be protected while it is on. Dorian, head home."*

&#x200B;

For one week now, I had to follow *his* rule for every night. When the sun rises, I'd be allowed to take it out. When the sun sets, I have to put the ball gag back on, or else I'd die.

And because it was *his* order to keep it secret, I think it'd be worth shaving off some of my own lifespan to tell you about this. My reflection has begun trying to kill me every night. And what *he* is making me put on every sunset is the only thing saving me.
