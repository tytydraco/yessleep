Do you ever wonder how different your life might have turned out if you changed just one small detail? Changed one seemingly minor decision? I never really considered it, until I found Luci's Cafe. 

I may never have noticed it if I hadn't been looking in the recessed doorways along that sidestreet downtown for a place to spit out my gum. And I wouldn't have been walking down that sidestreet if I hadn't left my headlights on and killed my car battery the night before. And I wouldn't have done that if I hadn't answered when my ex called as I pulled into the parking lot of my apartment building. But, all of those things did happen, and that's how I ended up there.

After I spit out my gum in the garbage can outside, I glanced up at my reflection in the unique storefront window, as pitch black as if  it had been cut from volcanic glass. Old english lettering spelled out 'Luci's Cafe' in firey hues that seemed to shift like glowing embers. I had never seen anything quite like it. I just had to have a look inside. 

The interior of the little shop was not as interesting. It looked more like a dingy waiting room than a coffee shop with a couple of chipped formica tables and yellowing linoleum. I might have turned to go if not for the barista behind the peeling laminate counter, a slender young woman with nervous hands.

"Good morning!" She greeted me with a little too much enthusiasm, as if she had never seen a customer in her life and hadn't particularly expected too. "Please, have a seat!"

"Good morning," I replied, already beginning to regret having opened the door. "I'm already late for work, but maybe I'll take something to go." I squinted around at the walls but found them blank except for a couple of generic art prints.  "Got a menu?"

"Don't need one," she replied, already pulling a mug from behind the counter. "We only serve black coffee, but it is a very, uh, unique blend."

"I don't know," I said, smiling politely as I stepped backward towards the door. "I'm more of a cream and sugar type of guy."

"You don't need that!" She nearly shouted throwing up her hands in a halting gesture as my fingers groped behind me for the doorknob. 

"Maybe another time. Have a nice-"

"Wait! Please!" She cried, her voice shrill with desperation which she tried to cover with a hollow, humorless laugh. "It's very smooth! Just try it! You'll see!" 

Pity for this obviously struggling business owner was beginning to win out over my own good sense, so I approached the counter. "Alright, Luci. Can I have it to-go, please? I'm late for work," I repeated, beginning to get annoyed as I watched her pour a steaming liquid into a chipped porcelain mug.

"No need!" She exclaimed, shoving the mug towards me with a smile that was a bit too wide and toothy. "It'll only take a second!"

I frowned as I looked at the dark liquid in the mug. It was black, alright. Not the rich, warm brown-black of every other coffee I'd ever seen, but a thick, inky black that more closely resembled oil. I took the mug by the handle and swirled the contents which coated the sides like thick paint. It certainly didn't smell like coffee, either. I wrinkled my nose at the smoky smell of charcoal and pushed the mug away. "You know what... I'm gonna pass on that," I said as I turned away. "Have a good one, though."

"Wait! Please!" She cried again, but I ignored her and continued towards the door. I only turned when her hands closed around my arm and she tried to physically pull me back inside with surprising strength for such a petite girl. 

"What the hell is wrong with you," I said, finally raising my voice as I wrenched my arm away from her clutching fingers.

"Please, you don't understand!" She cried just before I slammed the door behind me.

"Crazy," I muttered to myself as I pulled my coat around me and hurried the few remaining blocks to my office building. Little did I know what an understatement that would turn out to be. 

...

"Hey, Cheryl. Good morning," I smiled as I passed the receptionist, a sweet older lady known for her ever growing collection of colorful cat-eye glasses. 

"Morning, Sam," she said, returning my smile as I made my way to the elevators.

"Have to go back and drink that coffee, Sam," she added cheerfully.

I stopped in my tracks and whirled around to face her. "What did you say?" I asked.

"Um... I said have a nice day?" She said, looking at least as confused as I felt. 

"Oh, right. You, too," I said as I turned back toward the elevator. Must've imagined it.

The elevator was empty except for the quiet janitor leaning against his cart. The usual canned music was suddenly interrupted by a commercial. For coffee. "When did they start running ads?" I laughed, gesturing to the overhead speakers. 

The man, who had previously been fiddling with his phone glanced up at me and shrugged, but I got the distinct and uncomfortable impression that he didn't have the first idea what I was talking about. That notion was soon confirmed by the way he glanced at me over his shoulder as he got off on the floor below mine. Whatever. Just a coincidence. 

On my arrival to the office, I ducked past my boss's office and made a beeline for my cubicle. 

"Morning, guys," I said to my desk neighbors, Brian and Pete.  

"Morning," Pete said without looking up from the puzzle game he was playing on his phone. 

"Nice of you to finally join us," Pete grinned as he leaned back in his chair so far it looked like he might tip over. "You know how we hate to suffer alone."

"Least I'm not already taking a break," I said, gesturing at Brian who remained hunched over his screen scowling down at the kalediscope of candy graphics.

"He's been on break for, like, ten years at least," Pete chuckled. "Right Bri Bri?"

"Don't call me that unless you wanna be called Pee Pee," Brian retorted without so much as moving anything but his thumbs.

I snorted with laughter at that. The banter went a long way towards reestablishing normalcy. I was already starting to forget about the strange beginning to my day. 

I opened my email and turned my attention to a message from an important client. The message started out normally enough, just a request for some adjustments to the usual weekly order, which I added into the flowsheet I'd send to the warehouse.  I almost didn't notice the post-script:

'P.S. You really should have drunk that coffee, Sam. You better go back before it's too late.'

"What the fuck," I said loud enough to garner the attention of the guys. 

"What's the matter?" Pete asked. 

Brian actually put his phone down and peered around the divider, frowning. I moved to the side so he could see my computer screen.

"Am I losing it? What's this say?" I asked him, pointing to the post script.

He scooted himself closer on his rolling chair and pushed his glasses up on his nose.

"Says, 'Good morning Samuel...'"

"Samuel," Pete chuckled next door. 

"Not that part," I said, ignoring the latter. "Just the post script."

Brian leaned forward more and squinted at the screen. "Post script?" 

"Right there," I said leaning in next to him, intending to point at the message, only to find that it was no longer there.

Brian blinked at me as he wheeled himself out of my cubicle.  "You okay man?"

"He just needs to go back to Luci's and drink that coffee, right bud?" Pete chimed in.

I stood up and peered over the divider at Pete, who seemed thoroughly engrossed in whatever he was typing. 

"Pete?"

"Yeah?" He said without looking up.

"You say something just now?"

"Nope. Guess you really are losing it." He said, eyes still fixated on his screen as his fingers flew over the keyboard.

I turned to see Brian still frowning at me from his chair. "You sure you're alright, man?"

"Actually," I began, "I'm not feeling so hot, I think I'm gonna head home. I'll see you guys tomorrow."

I grabbed my coat off the back of my chair and shrugged into it as I headed towards the door before anyone had a chance to say anything else about -

"Make sure you go straight to Luci's," Brian's voice called out just before I shouldered the office door open. I didn't even bother looking back. 

And there was no way I was going back to that place. I didn't even take the same street on my walk back home.  So imagine my surprise when I tripped over a crack in the sidewalk and caught myself on a window of odd, black glass with shimmering red lettering. Guess I don't even have to tell you what it said. 

I spun away and speed-walked the rest of the way home without incident. I thought that perhaps I hadn't been sleeping well lately. Maybe if I just lay down for a while, maybe if I could get some sleep, I'd wake up and never hear about Luci's Cafe again.  Never even think about it, ideally. 

So, I headed to the bathroom to wash up and change before I lay down. When I twisted the faucet on, I jerked my hand away as if burned. The substance that  flowed from the tap was just as thick, oily and black as the coffee at Luci's. I squeezed my eyes shut against the vision, shook my head as if that could rid it of the memory. "Not happening," I said out loud to no one. "Not. Happening."

When I finally gathered the courage to open my eyes, the water flowing in the sink was as clear as ever. There was not so much as a grey film in the basin. Still, I cut off the tap without washing my face. Maybe later. 

I plugged my phone in before slipping underneath the covers. It vibrated as it always does, but this time, the little notification bar along the bottom of the screen read 'go back, sam. 57 minutes until it's too late.' I closed my eyes and shook my head again, since that seemed to turn the tap water back into tap water a few minutes ago. When I peeked at the screen, it read, 'super fast charging. 57 minutes until full.'

"Jesus, I am really psyching myself out," I mumbled to the empty room. 

For several minutes, I laid in bed listening to the pounding of my own heart. 'Too late for what?' I thought over and over. I reached for the remote on my night stand. Perhaps a comedy would help get my mind off of-

"LUCI'S CAFE!" The television speakers bellowed in a car salesman's thundering baritone. Although my fingers frantically smashed the power button, the screen continued to glow and promptly displayed a model leaning against a  brand new honda. She smiled and held out a steaming, chipped mug. "We're waiting for you, Samuel," she grinned. Unable to tear my eyes away, I noticed that she bore a striking resemblance to the barista from ths morning. Although perhaps that was just the too-wide smile. 

I got up and uplugged the television, only to find that it continued to implore me to return to the coffee shop of horrors. I stood with my arms crossed and stared at te image on the screen: thick, ink-black liquid tumbling from a carafe into the chipped ceramic mug that never filled up. It did not look appetizing in the least. 

I stood in front of the rogue appliance in my boxers and stared at it with my arms crossed for several minutes. Finally, I made a decision. I picked it up and crossed the apartment and set it outside in the hallway. My elderly neighbor, who happened to be standing in the hall with a fistful of mail stared at me with her mouth open.

"Don't mind me Ms. Ellie," I said with a smile that I'm sure looked at least mildly deranged. "Just taking out this piece of shit!" I cackled and kicked the screen until the image of the never-full mug splintered into a kalediscope of never-full mugs. "I never want to fucking see it ever again!"

"Sam?" Ms. Ellie said, her soft voice quavering as her hands shook and her letters fell to the floor. I felt instantly guilty and took a step towards her, forgetting that was sweaty, disheveled and nearly naked. 

"I'm sorry, Ms. Ellie," I began. "I've just had a really rough mor-"

"Maybe it would get better if you'd just fucking go back to Luci's instead of scaring old ladies in hallways you piece of shit!" She shreiked before slamming the door to her apartment. 

I stood in the hallway between Ms. Ellie's abandoned mail and my ruined television shaking with laughter. I laughed until I thought I might vomit. I was still laughing and clutching my aching guts as I turned back toward my apartment. I wasn't even surprised to find that it was made of black glass, the name of the coffee shop smoldering in red. I laughed some more and wiped the tears from my eyes before heading inside.

Everything looked the same as it had this morning. The barista stood behind the counter, the chipped mug still sitting in front of her, still steaming as if I had only just left. I looked her right in the eye as I strode toward the counter. She smiled at me. 

"You win, Luci," I said as I picked up the mug and drained the contents in several long gulps. The barista smiled wider and I soon wished I'd savored the beverage. It didn't taste at all like coffee. It was delicious, sweet and earthy. It warmed my throat and belly pleasantly, like wine. The barista clapped and shrieked her gratitude. She ran around the counter and hugged me tight before running towards the door. 

"I'm free!" She shouted. "Free!" And then she was gone.  I tried to follow and that's whe I learned Luci's first rule: I can't leave, not until I convince a customer to drink the coffee. I can step through the door, but I'm right back inside the cafe. 

I have learned several things since then. Luci is not the barista, as I assumed. Luci lives downstairs. He's  teaching me things. He talks to me all day, although I've never seen him. He just kind of puts the words into my head, you know? No. I guess you don't, at least, not yet.

 He says I'll learn the magic the barista used to get me here, eventually. But first, I have to learn to read the strange symbols his books are written in. Must've taken the old barista an eternity.

I would really prefer not to wait that long. Its boring as fuck here, if I'm being honest. Luci says I will live forever now and never age. Once I find my replacement, I'll be free to spend my eternal life as I please. He even provides you with a small fortune when you earn your freedom. Call it a severance package. 

It's not such a bad deal, really. 

Anyway, I'm glad I grabbed my phone before I left my apartment so I could tell this story and invite you to try this coffee for yourself, if you ever stumble upon the place. Which, now that it's in your head, you will. At least, that's what Luci says.
