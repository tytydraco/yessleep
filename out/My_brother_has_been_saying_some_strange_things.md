My brother has been saying strange things

I have an older brother named Jeremy. Jeremy is normally super sociable and an all around nice guy so it was very surprising when in the last couple of weeks he’s been barely talking to anyone at all. I mean seriously he won’t talk to me, our parents, his girlfriend, anyone. Hell his best friends came around the other week asking if he wanted to play some basketball but he didn’t even come out of his room. That was the last straw for me. Jeremy normally loves basketball and he treats his friends like family, not once in my 15 years of life have I ever seen him not want to hang out with people.

After dinner yesterday, I went up to his room and knocked 3 times on his door. No answer. I knocked 3 more times. No answer

“Jeremy, it’s me Logan can you please open the door”

Just as I said that the door creaked open despite no-one being anywhere near the door, the only person in the room was Jeremy, but it wasn’t Jeremy. I knew it wasn’t. He was curled up in a ball next to his bed sobbing uncontrollably, but the sobs weren’t sadness like his girlfriend broke up with him or something, they were what I can only describe has pure and utter pain. Agony.

I was so focused on Jeremy that I hadn’t even taken the chance to look around the rest of the room. The walls were covered in pentagrams that sent the most spine-chilling feeling down me that nothing else has ever done before. On the floor there was black sludge that smelled like absolute dog shit. The wooden planks that had once been a floor were torn up everywhere so I had to be careful where I stepped as to avoid getting splinters.

“Jeremy what the fuck is going on” I said with my voice shaking in fear

No reply 

“Seriously Jeremy are you alr-“

I let out the most bloodcurdling scream I have ever produced. I don’t even know if it was a scream since all my strength was going to my legs to keep me held in position.

In the blink of an eye Jeremy had gone from the fetal position sobbing next to his bed a few feet away to standing millimeters away from me. Jeremy has always been taller than me, but the height he was standing at now was nearly impossible for a human being. That wasn’t even the most terrifying part. His eyes were. His eyes were pitch black. An endless void of pain. Then he smiled. A toothy grin filled with sharp fangs and a mouth with that same endless void black. His smile went from one ear to the other. Seriously, it had cut open his face so the corners of his smile stretched from one end of his face to the other. And with a voice I can only describe as the devil speaking through Jeremy, he said “don’t worry Logan he takes care of me now” and then he began contorting I could hear his bones crack and snap as he struggled and then with a flash of black smoke he was gone. A few seconds later I fell to the ground unconscious.

I woke up in my room the next day with my mom and dad on the side of my bed. Outside it was a beautiful sunny day.

“Logan finally you woke up” my mom said frantically.

“Here champ have a glass of water” my dad said handing me a glass of water.

I put the glass down on my bedside table and muttered “what happened”

“Well we found you knocked out cold in the guest room”

Then I remembered what had happened the night before.

“Wait Jeremy, is he ok” I asked shaking with fear

“Who’s Jeremy” my mom asked with confusion in her voice.

“You know my brother Jeremy” I replied not knowing what they meant.

“Son you never had a brother, I think your still a bit tired come on Susan let’s leave so he can get some more sleep” my dad said.

My parents left the room but I was so full of questions I didn’t really care. A few minutes later however, I got the feeling that everything was ok. I felt fine, I looked fine. Hell I even forgot all about Jeremy for a minute.

I am now writing this a few hours later, you may be wondering if I’m ok. But don’t worry I’m fine.

After all, he is taking care of me now.
