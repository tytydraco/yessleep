The "Familiar or Men in Gray Suites' that is  Mill West  
    
	  
    
 Hello my dear /eerrh well, that's too much for right now/. Just \\\_hello\\\_ I guess. She's not been in the picture for a while you see and I am starting to get anxious, but more on that later this story has to start not finish. I am Mill West, this is my account, and well, I am familiar to fewer than the title entails. "They" call me West though. She-  
    
 He smirked.  
    
 "She calls me Mill" he said outloud in a whisper for the first time, and happily too.  
    
 /Another first/ he thought with her by his side only in the mind.  
    
 "I didn't know she did that" he slipped past his tongue commenting on his strange manner of speech while by /her/ side.  
    
 I guess I should explain what going on already, but too much happens for this to happen in the typical format. To be concise I am talking to you with my brain more than letters on a page and by doing this I end up missing most literary cues that normally occur.  
  
 "That's what he says but I disagree" she projected into his mind.  
  
    
 I hope this is alright as my work is too mysterious to be talked, written, and (especially for me) even thought.  Just clarifying I will do my best but my tone may seem off, just readwhat is written and hope that /he/ makes enough sense \\\_eerrh sorry again, /that/ was HER talking\\\_.   
    
 "Quite embarrassing" he thought hoping that his makeshift /italics/ and \\\_bolds\\\_ didn't clash with their inability to appear in this ancient format. The MIN-\\\*cough\\\* Notepad \\\*cough\\\*-D.  
    
 His brained cried at him that he should WRITE this out but his handwriting was too illegible, it cried again for HER as it might just be the job she would have to take on with her MD worthy chicken scratch handwriting.   
    
 Still better than mine he thought.  
  
 "I just wish she was here" said almost too audible drawing some attention from his fellow train riders.    
    
  
    
 I can't say where I am as its work and like I am trying to get to; it is both dangerous and mysteriously macabre in nature. Like the insanity causing whispers that drive would be politicians  
    
 to madness. Or the things that drive sailors into dangerous waters, Siren Songs of unknown origin. I argue that it is just the mind and that's not just me \\\*wink\\\*. Anyways, now is the time for sharing and I am   
    
 finding myself unable to elaborate. I guess we will start with the broadcast /or maybe not/ she chimed. The Mill West one /STOP/ she projected into my head, or at least I hope it was her. Maybe these thing have already seized my and her consciousnesses…  
    
/Sorry/ I projecte into her head/  
    
 Why'd I throw her under the bus? Just to make me feel less alone I guess. Might just be m- and a cold electric shock flew up his spine and spun his eyeballs almost out of there sockets  
    
 like a sneeze with your eyes open. With two broken orbitals he added wickedly; smirking en toe disturbing his fellow train riders. Was he getting too roudy.-e.  
    
 "Might just be m, m, m, me e, e, e!?!" he stutter horribly and far to loudly for his now snickering audience on the train.  
    
    
    
 I, uhm, pardon me this will be for another time. Its time for me to talk about me. Not those retched primordial demons from space...(I assume at least, I guess we will move along to the first part then).  
    
 Just after I get safe. You never seem to know who's safe these days. And in a flash he moved seats and hoped for her to chime in with some wise crack about how he always knows what to do, but nothing   
    
 came, not even a My Dear.  
    
  
    
 "Now that we are aquainted, at least as much as I am with anybody. We can discuss my work." he growled carefully but somehow rudely.   
    
  
    
 The attention from his fellow passengers scared him but before it got to him he was speaking, eeerrrrh, uhhh, writing, or aaahhh, telecommunicating via the mind. I don't know just listen.   
    
 My work is political, but where it takes me is a bit more grand. The types of people that you meet in my line of work vary far and wide. Spies, bonafide politicians, barons of industry,  
    
 ecofascists(some of whom I think to much alike), and even a few women someof whom are the preceding, but all of them tackle the world in a much stranger way. Some are madames of brothels, cartel personnel and even Lily(she's HER). These people tend to be unsavory to most but I have found them to fit quite nicely into my humble little life as a familiar, ghost, or a singular men in gray suites(which ever you prefer).  
  
 "All three!" she spoke to me softly from wherever she was now.  
    
This concludes the Mill West Broadcast Thank you for listening and remember  
their watching:)  
    
   
  
  
  
  
    
Day 1:  
    
To the man seeing burning treez,  
    
I know who you are and that they are looking for you. These ancient psuedo-hallucinations that attack the mind not unlike a parasites or even a predator. Perhaps these /things/ are  
    
just ancient whispers of human evolution projecting themselves into existence to any given individual in the gene pool like a genetic puppet show (or A-T:G-C kabuki theater as I like the  
    
call it). <<More on that later please  
    
Anyways Mill or erhhh aahh... West, as they call you out there. I glad you finally made contact with me.  
    
Can we chat somehow a little more private, please and thank you, oh you done it. That great me boy now just keep knodding and talking. What do /we/ do next.  
    
This concludes the Mill West broadcast. Thanks for tuning into the show tonight and remember we're watching you. :)  
  
    
Day 2:  
    
To the man who sees treez on fire,  
  
I usher you to look away now as these brain bugs or demonic genetic projections are getting close. They are hoody things that appear in trees and along fixtures.  
    
They are not just harmless as our genetic code expresses itself but they are something more than that and just as much more harmful in tandem;at least for those in the know.  
    
I now I must slow my speech as things get farther away. the trees almost smile now.  
    
Come closer again we must one again meet in privacy. Thanks again Mill always so expeditious.  
    
Chesire in nature; you know like... well... this; faces; cats; trees; chesire in nature. They whisper; and stutter; and jab at the; mind; in; a; way that  
    
is;;;;;;aaaaehhhgch;;;;; to hard to explain.  
    
My next clue awaits and \\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*\\\*

Day 4:  
    
To the man at the Sleepy Hollow Inn,  
  
"\\\\I KNOW WHO YOU ARE MILL WEST\\\\" said the primordial demon and her(notice the \\\\  \\\\ )from wherever they are...   
    
  
    
"They seem too old to be anything but some sort of permutation from space." thought Mill in his expositional way or did he ever so softly speak it.  
    
The waitress had returned with a pot of coffee.  
    
And after some eye dancing or silent film magic she whipped out her notepad for taking his order.  
    
\\\\He was sitting at the Sleepy Hollow Inn\\\\ permeated the room in her voice.  
    
The waitress took his order.  
    
"The Sleepy Hollow Special, does it really come with two drinks?" he said  
    
The waitress simply nodded at this hoody character. He had sat and waited for half an hour just drinking coffee before she took his order. He seemed to be upto nothing. No phone, no pencil, no writing, just gazing around ever so randomly as to not attract any attention in his corner.  
  
"Milk and OJ then..." He muttered   
    
"\\\\Please\\\\" she(not the waitress but HER; and no not the demons that we spoke of earlier either) whispered to him in his head.  
    
"Please" he finally spat out.  
    
The waitress was \\\\somehow\\\\ already three paces away.  
    
"Thanks, hun" she said with a splat.  
    
He simply waited.  
    
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE" they shouted at him.  
    
"Get out of here" the demons shunned at him. Panning between both ears striking him over and over again with his own voice.  
    
 Then out of the blue while these demons berated him appeared a large plate of butter fried honey french toast with a: a carmelized exterior from the sugar; and fluffy, airy interior almost eggy; and syrup on top making a decadent meal by it self. In addition he had a side of eggs cooked to perfection in bacon fat, sunny side up in fact runny almost surreal yellow yolks and albumen still jiggly from its mere basting in oil. And next to it on the plate was the missing bacon in which the eggs were fried; crunchy meat with soggy delicious fat. His meal came with the promised glass of cold milk 2% and other drink but it was a full jug of O.J. placed on table with its freshly squeezed pulp and juices still circulating in the jar.  
  
    
This full jug defied his expectation and must have been a flirt from the waitress. It was far too big to drink out of.  
    
  
He, \\\\or uhhh Mill\\\\, decided that since his juice glass was absent he would just finish the milk in one quick chug and use the now empty glass for the OJ. He finished almost the entire Pint leaving his plate untouched for now as he was to busy writing or thinking or whatever he does. \\\\Quite possibly her talking here and now\\\\. Anyways. He had work to do.   
    
And he sat and drank his coffee. They'd both agreed that's what he would do. Leaving his food untouched for an hour. Mainly ignoring the now belligerent waitress besides his refill of course which he kept needing to ask for. Not just by talking but by waving so widely across the resturant  that it created an awkward wiggle with his whole being. Inapporiate they thought. Everyone(the waitress, him, and the girl in his head) but the space demons or {Primordials} as I will refer to them from now on.   
    
    
He left and that was it..,  
   
This concludes the Mill West Broadcast. \\\\Thank you and goodnight\\\\ Stay away from her,  
    
\~The {Primordials}  
    
  
P.S. It is almost a play and should be taken quite literally with \\\\slash slash \\\\meaning her speaking; italics being his thought ; and quotation marks “for talking and/or diaglouge”. The {primordials} talk in bold and are curly bracketed for stylistic purposes.
