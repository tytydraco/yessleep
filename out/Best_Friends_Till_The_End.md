I’m sitting across from my best friend, Nora, at our usual diner, a greasy little place tucked between a laundromat and a pawn shop. She’s stirring her coffee too fast again, the spoon clinking violently against the ceramic. I don’t say anything, just watch. It’s a small thing. Insignificant, really. But I’ve started paying attention to the small things lately.

Nora looks up and smiles. “You’re quiet today.”

I shrug and force a smile back. “Just tired.”

It’s not a lie, but it’s not the whole truth either. I’m tired of the late-night news alerts. I’m tired of hearing that another woman’s body has been found—strangled, staged, scrubbed clean of prints. I’m tired of feeling like I know something I’m not supposed to know.

Three murders in six months, all within ten miles of our apartment complex.

“I think I’m gonna head home early,” I say, pushing my half-eaten pancakes to the side. Nora frowns for a fraction of a second before she composes herself.

“You sure?” she asks. “We were supposed to go thrifting after this.”

“I’ve got a headache,” I lie.

She tilts her head. “You’ve had a lot of those lately.”

I nod and stand, reaching for my coat. I can feel her eyes on me as I turn to leave. That’s new, too. The way she watches me when she thinks I’m not looking.

At home, I open my laptop and pull up the article again—Victim #3, blonde, early thirties, last seen at a gas station on the outskirts of town. There’s grainy security footage: a woman in a red hoodie stepping into a silver sedan. I’ve looked at that video at least a dozen times, and I’m starting to believe I’ve seen that hoodie before.

Nora has one just like it.

Of course, it could be coincidence. Lots of people have red hoodies. But Nora’s been acting…off. She disappears for hours without explanation. I’ve seen her come home with dirt on her boots. One night, she left a duffel bag in the trunk of her car and snapped at me when I offered to carry it in.

She’s never snapped at me before.

The next time I’m over at her place, I ask to borrow her charger and pretend I forgot mine. She waves toward her bedroom. “Should be plugged in by the nightstand.”

I enter slowly, like the room might bite me.

I’m not sure what I’m looking for. I open drawers without touching too much, check under the bed, behind the closet door. I don’t find anything… until I reach the back of her closet.

There’s a plastic storage bin with a broken latch. I pry it open.

Inside: a folding knife, a stained rope, and something that makes my stomach drop—a set of driver’s licenses. Three different women. Three different faces. All now dead.

I nearly drop the lid as I close it.

When I return to the living room, Nora is watching me.

“Find the charger?” she asks, her voice light, playful.

I nod. “Yeah. Thanks.”

She smiles again—too wide this time—and I realize something else.

She knows I know.

And now I’m not sure which of us is going to make it through the week.
