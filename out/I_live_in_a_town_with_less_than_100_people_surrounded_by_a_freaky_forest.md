I've been here for as long as i remember, not that i can remember much but i've fully familiarized myself with the laws and overall rules of the local flora and fauna. It appears alive, which you could say is natural - that's the whole point, but not alive in a typical way, it's like this forest is a Russian cemetery. With creepy framed pictures and black grave stones made out of marble. Where you know you'll get violated by something sooner or later, an animal or a person, or the secret third option. Regardless, this metaphor id say fits the forest perfectly. Despite being isolated in the middle of it, with a path barely showing through the unkept grass, which leads to the rest of the recluses, i haven't felt alone. There's always a presence. Sometimes i swear i can see the trees moving, only to realize that it's more like a giant mix of a human and a moose...or an elk? A deer? I don't know the difference. Ideally i should know it, but i guess i'm too invested into engraving all of the mushroom types that grow around these parts into my brain. 

Oh well. 
I've started this story just to share the peculiar notes i write down in the middle of the night, or day, when i see these abominations running around my humble cottage. Not literally 'around' as inside of my house, that sometimes too but i digress, 'around' as - outside, out there in the forest. 

The only...person? I don't know if you can consider a six feet tall woman with horns and badly masked hooves to be a person, but i digress. The only person i talked with properly, for the last few years was this woman simply known as Madám. You'd expect a continuation but that's simply what she's known as. Makes me wonder if she was named that, or if she named herself? Trust me, i'm no expert in social cues and human laws but i assume this is a weird name for a woman of her status to hold. After all, she is adored and feared by all of the local residents. At least the ones in the minuscule town. She owns the one and only pub. It's open 24/7 as far as i'm aware, although this one guy with a horse tail tried convincing me that sometimes it's open for longer than that. Wasn't sure what he meant by that, and i also couldn't relate him to any of the houses, not even number 40 - which for whatever reason repeats. It's not the same house by any means, but still. 

Right now i wanted to focus on Madáme, excuse my rambling but i can't stay focused with all of the pandemoniac noise coming from inside my attic. Haven't touched that place in a while, maybe the weird glowing spider mutated from that funky looking caterpillar that i forgot to lock away. It was already dead. Taxidermy, i mean. I don't just have a random dead caterpillar up there.. 

As i was saying, i last visited the pub two days ago, i was unsure if i was welcome to return any time soon as we had an akward interaction with Madáme... 
 You see - the customers don't seem to notice how her 'costume' is so realistic and  on point every day, they also don't question as to why she's working 24/7 and only leaves the pub to run around the forest. I guess if i was one of those people i wouldn't exactly question my only source of entertainment, however the issue i have is that she covers up those goat horns of hers. She always wears big, extravagant, elegant straw hats to take away the attention from them, but i can't help but notice them staring at me through the mended grass layers. I never pointed this out to her - didn't want to make her "uncomfortable", whatever that means.  Despite our relationship being pretty close, to the extent that she makes time to guide me around the forest to help me finish my map, i never tried addressing the elephant (or should i say goat) in the room. 

Well, all the 'efforts' went to shit just two days ago, as my beloved brain forgot to register the difference between a male and female bathroom and guided me to the closest one in order to rid my hands off the sticky sensation which pub tables seem to have engraved into them. I was having fun with the soap, as it wasn't liquid but those fun bubbles - the glory of civilization - and the woman herself walked in. She seemed tired and i felt bad for looking up into the mirror, as she clearly wasn't paying attention to who was in there. In the reflection i saw her lean  against the wall, crouching down and slowly sliding the grand hat off her head. At this point she couldn't see me stare at her unless i just turned around, so i outlined my presence by turning on the tap and seemingly minding my own business as if the mirror wasn't there. I heard her spring up, her hooves hitting the tiled floor as she tried stabilizing herself. 

"Taika?", she called out my name,"why are you in the woman's bathroom?"
She seemed to have composed herself, but i felt a sense of unease, she sounded distrustful...or maybe concerned? I'm new to this whole concept of human emotions and feelings so forgive my ignorance. 

"Sorry...forgot there's a difference," I mumbled as my mind was once again preoccupied with the bubbly soap, "I just needed to get the sticky mystery liquids off my hands and it was the closest one to me."
I looked up as i felt the air shift with her approach, she stood behind me with a dazed look and the hat back on. Didn't seem like she had a conversation starter in mind so i helped her get her thoughts back to the 'women in stem' mentality.
"Did you want something?" 
"No. Not exactly. Not from you anyways.."
I turned around as I started drying my hands on one of my lacy, patterned handkerchiefs. 
"I see. The smoke getting to ya?"
"Yeah, i told them to not smoke that weird assortment of grasses inside but they don't listen anymore."
"The white ones?"
"What?"
"The white coat people?"
"Sure, i guess?" She seemed unsure if i knew that she knew that i knew that we're both talking about those cultists which live around the huge oak tree. Atleast i think they do? Surely they don't live in the oak tree? Now i'm actually uncertain..
She continued to say that she's rather them have smoking weed but they're too sheltered to actually buy any. Now that i think of it, i haven't looked into whether any one of those 73 people have secret meth labs or at least some kind of illegal drug facilities. Then again, wouldn't want a repeat of last time. I don't think they can keep blaming the raccoons for what i left of the garage in house 11... 

Anyways, sorry for the abrupt end but i have discovered a new mission which simply can't be delayed. See you later if i remember about this new online endeavor of mine. I should write it down before i forget..
