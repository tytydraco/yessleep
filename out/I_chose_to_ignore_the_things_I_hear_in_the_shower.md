I’m sure we’ve all had that one experience where we think we hear screams or loud noises while being in the shower and think our family is arguing or being murdered. God I wish I wouldn’t have ignored them that night.


It’s a typical Saturday evening, no school, playing video games all day, going outside, all that good stuff. I went out to play football with my friends Jimmy, Declan, and Jack. This is a normal thing for us, we meet at the neighborhood park every Saturday around 6:00 and we all get called in for dinner at 8:00. I’m always on the same team as Declan and Jimmy and Jack are together. I always play wide receiver so I come home extremely sweaty. When we heard Jimmy’s Mom call him on his phone, we all knew it was 8:00 and time go in for dinner. We all parted ways.



My Mom and Dad are my favorite people in the world. We do everything together and that’s how we’ve always liked it. I walked in the house, took off my shoes and barely made it up the stairs from exhaustion. My parents claimed I smelled from all the way down stairs and to go take a quick shower before eating with them, so I did. 



I turned on the shower, hopped in and started washing myself. Strangely enough, about halfway through, I start feeling like I’m hearing my parents either argue or scream in terror. I brush this off because they never argue nor scream, we like to keep a pretty quiet household. Not creepily silent but not overly loud either. I washed my hair and body and started drying my body. Combed my hair down, put on some deodorant, and started heading downstairs. 



No no no, “WHAT THE FUCK!” I screamed in terror. I’m sure the whole neighborhood heard me. My parents were..dead. How could this have happened? Did I not lock the door on my way in? I immediately started sobbing as I dialed 911 into my moms phone. “Come immediately, my parents are dead!” I shouted while sobbing into the phone. I wait patiently for the police to arrive then I remember the noises I heard in the shower. I hear these noises often and it’s never anything wrong. But then again, why was this time different? Perhaps was the screaming I heard in the shower my parents begging for help?




The police arrived and carried the bodies outside and into an ambulance. My thoughts were racing in my mind I couldn’t stop and think about what was happening. Was I dreaming? I was interviewed by police a few days after the incident. They asked if I heard or saw anything that could have hinted this incident. I told them no. If I told them about the screams, they’d think 2 things. One being that everyone hears those things in the shower, and two getting mad at me for it and blaming their death on me.



I was placed in an adoption center and was later adopted by my new parents. I could never play football with my friends again, what if I came in 5 minutes early? Declan, Jimmy, and Jack all felt terrible for me. I can’t blame them. 



It’s been 10 years since that incident. Im 17 now and I just heard screams in my shower again.
