I’ll start by saying this: I travel a lot.

I’d also lost my phone the day before my flight. Not ideal, but I didn’t think much of it. I actually liked being disconnected while away. Of course — the one time I’d really need it...   


This was my first time in New York City. I’d flown in from London and landed around 7:30 p.m. I’d booked a transfer in advance from JFK to my hotel — a fairly new 5-star place near Times Square.



It was January 2023. I was 27 (M) The weather was surprisingly mild, but it was pouring down. My driver didn’t speak much English, which I was grateful for. I hate forced small talk, I was awkward and shy, especially when I’m tired. The car was electric, so the only sound was the tires rolling through puddles — rhythmic and calming, like waves at sunset.



As we approached Manhattan — A soaked, dark, miserable evening — I couldn’t believe I was actually there. NYC had always been a dream destination of mine.

The hotel was huge. Sixty-one floors — something my European brain just couldn’t process. I tipped the driver, grabbed my suitcase and laptop bag, and ran inside before the rain could soak me.

I went to check in. They explained that the elevators had some issues so you don't need to scan your room key to select your floor at the moment. 

By the time I checked in and got to my room on the 18th floor, it was around 8:30 p.m. The corridor was full of random memorabilia — old guitars, framed records, pictures of rockstars. Like a themed museum.

I set the air con to 17°C (I do that in all hotels — I can’t sleep unless it’s cold), got comfy, and realised how starving I was. With the rain still hammering down outside and my body clock saying it was 2 a.m., I decided to order room service: a burger, fries, Pepsi, and New York cheesecake. Nothing fancy — just comfort food.



About 30 minutes later, I heard a knock.



"Room service,” said a soft female voice.



I opened the door. A hotel staff member rolled the tray in, set it on the desk, smiled, and left. I tipped her, shut the door, and dug in.



It was amazing. American food has always been my favourite. I savoured every bite — especially at those prices.



After eating, I got up with the tray in hand to leave it outside the room. But as I reached the door, about a meter away, I froze.



No sound. No movement. Just... a feeling.



Something deep in my gut screamed don’t open that door. No reason. No logic. But I obeyed.



I quietly backed up and set the tray back down. My heart was pounding. I told myself it was jet lag. Paranoia. Exhaustion.



Still... I crept toward the door, leaned in, and looked through the peephole.



And my stomach dropped.



There was a man standing outside.



All black clothing. A red baseball cap pulled low over his face so I couldn't see it. Clothes dry and clean — he didn’t look homeless or desperate.



Then I saw his hands.

Black gloves.



And in one of them...



A long kitchen knife.



He wasn’t hiding it. Just standing there, head down, knife in hand.



I don’t think he knew I was looking through the peephole.



I didn’t move. Didn’t scream.



Turns out, I have no fight-or-flight response. Great time to find that out.



My only thought: I’m fucked.



Then my brain kicked in. He wasn’t breaking in — the door was chained. I had done that after room service arrived.

He must’ve seen my room service get delivered. He was waiting for me to open the door again — tray in hand, tired, vulnerable.



I peeked again.

Still there.

Same spot.

Still.

Waiting.



I had no phone. No window escape. No way to scream without him hearing me.



So I waited.



Ten minutes.

Twenty.

Forty-five.



Then — another knock.



My heart almost stopped. I peeked again.



This time, he was looking up.



I saw his face.



His eyes.



Black, dilated pupils. Cold. Empty. Evil.



He raised his hand and knocked gently again. Then, in the calmest voice:



“Room service here… just collecting your plate.”



He knew I was in there.



He wasn’t trying to rob me.



He was trying to kill me.



I started crying. Quietly. Shaking.



And then — I remembered something.



The connecting door.



I’d noticed earlier that my room was connected to the one next door by a solid wooden door. I crept over and quietly unlocked it.



It opened into a tiny closet-like space, and beyond that, another door — the one to the neighbouring room.



I pressed my ear against it.



Voices. Talking. People.



Relief hit me like a wave.



But I couldn’t knock — I didn’t want them to panic and think I was the psycho killer.



So I crept back across the room, grabbed the hotel notepad, and scribbled:



“CALL FOR HELP — THERE’S A MAN WITH A KNIFE AT MY DOOR.”



I slid the note under the door and prayed.



Meanwhile, the knocking at my own door got louder.



More aggressive.



He was jiggling the handle now. Pushing. Testing.



I sat on the edge of the bed and cried. I’ve never felt so helpless.



Then — footsteps.

Heavy ones. Many of them. Charging down the hall.



Followed by shouting:



“Police! Drop the weapon! Get on the floor!”



A scuffle. More yelling. Then silence.



A knock at my door followed.



I looked through the peephole — POLICE!



I opened the door, still shaking. One officer said something I’ll never forget:



“We’ve got him in custody. We also found a shopping bag outside your door… it had bin bags, a small axe and cleaning supplies inside.”



He came prepared.



To kill 



And clean up after.



The guests next door — the ones who called for help — checked out the next morning before I ever got the chance to thank them.



But they saved my life.



So, to the psycho on the other side of that door:



Let’s never, ever meet again.
