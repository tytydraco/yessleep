Last week, the distance between the perimeter walls of Wyre Forest and the forest proper was eighty-seven metres, thirty-three centimetres and six millimetres in length – that’s four millimetres longer than the day before.

 

I’ve been living in this village for the better half of a decade with my wife Susan and our Jack Russell, Barney.  Wyre forest is a short walk from our house; one left turn and a few minutes of walking takes you to the waist-high cobblestone wall encircling the woods. Once you’re adjacent to the wall, take a left and soon you’ll be at an opening. From this opening a dirt path splits a thick field of grass until you reach the tree line, typically taking a minute to clear. Your reward for this journey is a sprawling coniferous woodland that greets you with the scent of pine and earthiness, and a chorus of songbirds chirping the hours away. This immediate area of the forest was quiet save for neighbours on their own walks, which was ideal for us. Barney was very selective in his friendliness. If he warms up to you, the biggest risk he poses to your health would be licking you to death, but he isn’t afraid to challenge most dogs that crossed his path – even those the size of a small bear.

 

Wyre Forest is also idyllic for my hobby in photography. I found peace in snapping pictures of the scenery and fauna I’d come across then sharing them on the internet, although many of the animals I come across have a sixth sense in detecting when someone’s about to take their picture; woodpeckers are particularly camera-shy.

 

Two months ago, when walking the dirt path towards the forest I first felt something was off. I paused for a moment to look back towards where we came. Susan took a few steps ahead and tried continuing our conversation about our latest binge-watch before coming to a halt upon noticing I was distracted.

 

“What’s up?” she asked.

 

“Nothing, I just thought… is it me or did it take a tad longer to walk that path?”

 

Susan shot me an incredulous smirk. “We’re getting slower Frank, that’s why.”

 

I chuckled in agreement and dismissed the thought, continuing our walk into the forest. I didn’t think about the path again until a couple of weeks later. Once again, we cleared the same dirt path as we do every day, and once again I stopped at the tree line. I looked back at the cobblestone boundary; at this point in my life I’ve done this walk over a thousand times, but I could have sworn it took me an extra step or two more than it usually takes walking this path.

 

“You haven’t forgotten the doggy bags again, have you?” Susan asked. Dappled sunlight painted her stare as she watched me.

 

“No, I just- I swear it took us longer again to walk that path.”

 

“Oh not this again,” Susan said with slight exasperation. She went to say something, but I started back down the path again. “Where are you going?”

 

“I won’t be a minute Suze; I just want to check something.”

 

Once I’d backtracked to the other end of the path, I stood on the precipice of the pavement and dirt and stared at the forest. This isn’t normally the type of thing I actively pay attention to, but it definitely seemed like the trees were slightly farther back than I’ve seen them in the past. That’s when I had an idea; I took the camera strapped around my neck and placed it carefully on the corner of the left-most wall. I repositioned it until the camera base and stone below were aligned. Then, I focused the camera properly, adjusted the settings to account for lighting and snapped a picture.

 

From this point on, every day we went for a walk I developed a routine – align the camera on the same part of the wall, take a picture of the tree line with the same settings as always and continue our walk as normal. Upon my return home I would upload the pictures to my computer and compare them. I layered the pictures over each other on photoshop and scrutinised them, ensuring they were perfectly aligned. Looking at the three pictures stacked on top of each other distorted the trees into a blur, making it look like an abstract painting. When I zoomed in on the picture, I could see that the newer the photograph was, the more distant the trees appeared, albeit minimally.

 

Susan brought up the idea that maybe the camera wasn’t perfectly aligned each day I took a picture, which could account for the discrepancies. I disagreed; maybe the camera wasn’t perfectly positioned each time, but even still the way the pictures routinely shrunk each passing day confirmed in my mind that something was off. Still, she unintentionally brought up a valid point – I needed an alternate way of measuring the distance between the wall and forest.

 

That same night I ordered a surveyor’s wheel online. It arrived that very weekend, so I tested it out in our back garden. A surveyor’s wheel is a device used for measuring distances across ground; it comprises of a long pole with a wheel connected at the bottom sort of like one half of a bike. The wheel’s fender has a digital screen attached to it; this screen breaks down the distance the wheel travelled in metres, centimetres and millimetres. I took the wheel for a spin around the garden with the audience of Susan and Barney sat at the patio table, watching me walk back and forth across the lawn with equally baffled expressions.

 

“Having fun?” Susan asked playfully.

 

“No,” I lied.

 

The following day after our morning walk, I returned home to grab my surveyor’s wheel and headed back to the wall alone. “Put the kettle on for when I come back,” I called out before leaving the house.

 

Once I reached the dirt path, I aligned the starting arrow on the wheel on the boundary between the pavement and path. Then I marched forward in the straightest line possible. The wheel made a satisfying click with each other step taken, like a ticking clock counting down the walk. Towards the end of the path a tree root snaked across the forest floor. As soon as the wheel connected with the root I stopped. I marked where the wheel met the root with a sharpie and noted down the measurement on the screen: Eighty-six metres, seventy-seven centimetres and five millimetres.

 

I did the walk a few more times to make sure it was conclusive. The path was mostly straight, however lumps and stones in the dirt could cause discrepancies in my findings. Three times I walked from the very start of the path until the wheel stopped at the mark on the root. The measurements varied by millimetres, so I decided to find the average between them, note it down then finish my research for the day.

 

This became somewhat of a daily ritual. I think I must have built a reputation with my neighbours as the crazy wheel guy, but I didn’t care. This research added a bit of excitement in my life - the mystery of the receding woods. Every day I’d measure the path several times, take a picture of the tree line and study the pictures at home on my laptop. True enough the forest in each photograph gradually shrank with each one I took, and the measurements I noted from the dirt path were steadily increasing by millimetres. One day it was two millimetres, another seven. It was inconsistent metrically, but the fact remained; each day I measured the path, it was always slightly longer than the last. But how?

 

I wanted to bring my research to the attention of the local rangers from the Wyre Forest Trust - I didn’t understand the phenomenon, but what I understood was the potential threat posed to the forest. If Wyre Forest was gradually shrivelling away inch-by-inch, what if the rate of its receding escalates? What if it eventually faded into nothing but a grassy field over the years? It was as if some mysterious force was sapping the forest away until nothing remained. The problem was I could foresee this case being thrown out instantly if I bring it to the rangers’ attention too early. If I garner a reputation as ‘that crazy old man who rambles about the forest disappearing’ I doubt my grievances would ever be taken seriously again. I had some photographic evidence and the path measurements, but I felt like I needed one more strong piece of evidence to hammer home my findings. Fortuitously, I stumbled across a third piece of the puzzle the following day.

 

The three of us were on our usual walk - Susan by now was subscribed to my research once she couldn’t dispute the evidence further. We would regularly chat and joke about theories on what could be causing this phenomenon: invasive flora? Pollution? Aliens? Okay, the third thing was a joke, but I wasn’t prepared to throw anything out.

 

We deviated from our usual route into the deeper area of the forest where the trees were more condensed, and the birds sung louder than ever. Whilst my latest research had become something of a new hobby, it could never replace my first love of wildlife photography.  I was adjusting my camera lens to snap a picture of a preening jay and cursed under my breath as it abruptly flew off, making a series of rapid caws like an old hag’s cackle as it left. As I let the camera go slack around my neck, I noticed something odd in the distance.

 

“Let’s go over there a sec,” I said, heading further into the forest.

 

“Come on Barn,” she said, gently tugging the leash to entice Barney away from a stick he took interest in.

 

What I’d seen was what can best be described as a lump of earth around ten feet high in the centre of a clearing. The mound was covered in decaying fir needles and branches that speckled the body of earth in varying shades of greens and browns, its colour palette reminiscent of the camouflage pattern on a soldier’s uniform. I drank in the sight for a moment, then walked a lap around the base of the mound until I stopped at where Susan and Barney were standing.

 

“I don’t think I’ve seen that hill before, have you?” Susan asked.

 

“No,” I replied, then after a pause said, “it’s weird, it almost looks too perfect.”

 

“What do you mean?”

 

“Most hills are uneven and lumpy, right? This one doesn’t to me. It’s like someone caked half a sphere in mud and smoothed it over. Do you see what I mean?”

 

Susan tilted her head a bit at the sight. “Yeah, I think I do actually.”

 

We examined the mound for a moment before curiosity overcame me once more. I approached the mound and started to climb up. The mound was a bit too step for feet alone to conquer, so I got my hands dirty and scrambled up to the peak on all fours. Once I was on the top, I tested the ground with a few stomps, sounding nothing more than a few dull thuds. The ground was firm, far firmer that the soft earth we usually trod in these woods - it was almost like stomping on a boulder.

 

“Frank… I think we should go.”

 

Susan’s tone was a jolt of ice that snapped my attention towards her. She sounded worried all of a sudden. I wanted to crack a joke but stopped myself when I saw her expression of dread. I slid down the hill and approached her.

 

“What’s up?” I asked, wiping my palm on my coat before tenderly grasping her hand.

 

“I don’t know, there’s just something about this area specifically - it’s making me uneasy. I mean just look at Barney.”

 

I looked down at him. Barney’s tail was between his legs. I could see the whites of his eyes as he tilted his head away, but his pupils were laser focused on the mound. Barney was a little warrior; I’ve seen him scare off a rottweiler before. If he was unsettled, something was clearly wrong with this mound of earth. I knelt down on one knee and gently scratched the top of Barney’s head, which he reciprocated without taking his eyes off the mound.

 

“Okay, let’s go.” I said as I rose, before ushering the two with me away from the mound. But then I stopped at a tree stump on the edge of the clearing.

 

“Frank, please-” Susan protested, but I interjected.

 

“Go on ahead, I won’t be a moment,” I said as I set the camera onto the tree stump. I angled it so the mound was centred in frame, marked where the camera’s base was resting on top of the stump, then took a picture. After that we briskly left the clearing and headed back. We didn’t talk much until we arrived back at the house.

 

Susan made it clear she didn’t want to walk Barney near that hill again, a sentiment I agreed with. I still wanted to further investigate that mound, however. From that moment on, every day that I could I’d take a picture of the forest, measure the path, then I would walk to the mound and take a picture of it from the same tree stump as before. I would also do a lap around the mound’s circumference with the surveyor’s wheel. Susan didn’t like me going there alone but at this point my curiosity had curdled into an obsession; I had to know what was happening in this forest and I firmly believed that this mound may be the epicentre of the mystery.

 

When I loaded the pictures of the mound onto photoshop, it was like the tree line pictures all over again but in reverse; every day the lump of earth got slightly taller and closer to the camera, albeit minutely. The measurements I took from the wheel also indicated it was gradually getting wider; two millimetres, five millimetres – one day it was even one centimetre wider.

 

I began to gather an understanding of what was going on; this growing lump served as a tumour pulled the out-rim of the forest inwards. It was like a giant, invisible hand had pinched this part of the forest and was slowly pulling it up. I decided that now was the time to share my findings; I began writing up a document on what I’d discovered, breaking down the timescale and measurements I’d taken as well as piling together the photographs I’d snapped with annotations detailing the date taken and height of the canopy. I included my contact details at the end of the document and emailed the Wyre Forest Trust. Now I just had to wait.

 

A few days later, I got a call on my mobile.

 

“Hi, is this Frank?” a gruff, northern voice spoke.

 

“Speaking.”  
 

“Hi Frank, this is Evan from the Wyre Forest Trust.”

 

I lurched forward in my armchair a little bit, almost spilling my coffee in the process.

 

“Oh uh, hello! Thank you for getting back to me.”

 

“First, allow me thank you for the email - however I’m gonna need to be blunt here; my colleagues haven’t taken that much interest in it.”

 

I couldn’t help but deflate at this comment, especially after how much work I’d spent looking into this the past couple of months. I began to protest: “But I’m telling you, it’s real I swear-”

 

“Let me finish.” Evan interrupted. “My *colleagues* haven’t taken much interest in it. But I have. See, I’ve been walking the same path to work for years. I too had this strange feeling that the path was getting longer but shook it off as a false alarm. Your email changes things though.”

 

“I see. May I ask, where do you live?”

 

It turned out the town where he lived was on the opposite end of the forest from where I live.  If Evan noticed the woods receding as well, then that meant the entire radius of the forest could be shrinking into itself.

 

I cleared my throat before speaking. “So, my theory is this: the mound I pictured in the document, I think that’s the epicentre of this phenomenon.”

 

“How so?”

 

I paused to think about how I was going to phrase this, then came up with an analogy.

 

“Imagine a deflated balloon underneath a blanket laid out flat. If you gradually inflated that balloon, the ends of the blanket would gradually recede right?”

 

“Hm. So you’re saying there’s something under that mound that’s physically pulling the forest into itself?”

 

“Yeah, I know it sounds crazy but…” I trailed off, expected Evan to dispute me.  
  
  


“…but something has to be causing this.” Evan finished for me.

 

The line was quiet for a moment.

 

“Do you have a shovel, Frank?”

 

I smiled to myself. “Yeah. Are you free later?”

 

I could feel Evan’s smile through the phone. “I finish work at five. Is six okay for you?”

 

After the phone call I set to work gathering important equipment; two shovels, a pair of gardening gloves, a notepad and pen, a flask of tea and spare plastic cup for Evan, a large bottle of water, a bag of peanuts and of course my camera. I debated bringing the surveyor’s wheel but at this point felt it served its purpose. The answer to our mystery lay underneath the earth; we just had to dig.

 

Susan tried to dissuade me from going to the mound with a complete stranger, especially as night was drawing quick. I reassured her that everything would be okay and promised to deck Evan on the head with the shovel should it turn out he’s a serial killer. I really wish I’d heeded her warning now, but not because of Evan.

 

Six o’clock rolled by and blanketed the forest with the shadow of a cloudy dusk. Evan was waiting by a parked car next to the dirt path. He was a stocky, bald man in his forties sporting a heavy black beard and a thick green coat jacket with the Wyre Forest Trust logo plastered on its breast. He reintroduced himself and clasped my hand with a firm handshake.

 

“Nice to put a face to the name,” he said flashing a grin. “Lemme get my things from the trunk.”  
  


After Evan gathered his belongings, the pair of us walked into the forest. There was still enough daylight to see, but we had torches on hand for when night inevitably took over. I got to know Evan a bit more during our walk; he’s a very kind and sincere guy with a passion for his work; the time slipped by as he regaled a couple of stories from his work-life. Before I knew it, we’d finally reached the mound.

 

“Here it is. Has that hill always been there?” I asked.

 

Evan started setting his things down, then surveyed the area. His gaze fixed on the lump of earth for a short time. “I don’t know,” he finally said. “I’ve never *noticed* it before, that much I can say.”

 

We studied the mound for a few minutes and debated where our dig site should be. I suggested we start digging on top of the hill, but Evan disagreed.

 

“We don’t know what’s under there. Say it was an air pocket or something; we could risk collapsing the entire thing and falling with it.”

 

He picked up his shovel and tested different points of the slope with quick, efficient jabs. After a few moments of prodding the mound, he came back to me.

 

“It all feels the same consistency. The ground’s firm – it’ll take some time to break into.”  
  


“Well then…” I said with a grunt as I lifted my shovel, “we’d better get to work.”

 

The two of us agreed on the same spot in the slope and began digging our shovels into it. The problem with digging into the slope was with every successful shovel full of earth scooped away, more dirt from above would crumble and fall into the hole.  We were making small but gradual progress on the mound, but the labour was taxing. I felt sweat pool across the back of my t-shirt and had to take constant breaks for tea and water. Evan, being the more athletic between us, fared much better and was kind enough to not get frustrated at my frequent breaks. By this point the dig-site was around four foot deep, yet we’d unearthed nothing peculiar so far.

 

Evan took his first break as I was on my third. I swigged the dregs of my tea to the view of the forest away from the mound. Darkness was slowly seeping into the woods, and the sound of chirping birds was beginning to fade into silence. Evan came to a stop next to me, embedded the shovel half-way into the earth below and leant on its handle, studying the mound as he did.

 

“This is taking longer than expected,” he sighed. He spat phlegm to the ground besides him and continued: “Let’s do this for, say, fifteen more minutes before it gets too dark. We can always continue this another day.”  
  


I was a bit disappointed by the slow progress we made but reluctantly agreed with Evan. There was no need to rush this. “I need another minute, then I’ll carry on.” I replied.

 

I turned my gaze back into the forest and gulped down some water. When I finished, Evan started digging again; I heard lose dirt spilling in droves behind me. *That was a quick break Evan*, I thought to myself as I set the water down.

 

“Help yourself to some tea if you need it,” I called out. “There’s plenty left.”

 

Then, I felt a slight but frantic tapping on my shoulder. “Frank. *Frank!*” I heard Evan hiss.

 

I turned. Evan was stood right next to me, shovel still embedded in the ground. He hadn’t moved from that spot since we just spoke a moment ago - yet I could still hear digging coming from the mound.

 

I spun around to face the noise. Dirt and small stones were spewing out of the hole we made in sporadic intervals, landing on the floor several feet away from the mound. Something was burrowing *out* of the mound. No, not burrowing - the dirt was bursting out the hole too violently for that; whatever was under that earth may well have been punching the earth out of its way, like a hatchling breaking out of its egg. The hole was widening at an alarming rate, but the lack of sunlight and amassing lose dirt in the opening concealed whatever was disrupting the earth. I could just about make out the shape of a large, rounded head or appendage taking shape underneath the lose layer of dirt when Evan spoke up.

 

“We need to go. NOW.”

 

He didn’t need to tell me twice. With no time to grab any belongings, I spun around and bolted into the woods by Evan’s side. When we were around ten metres away from the clearing, I heard an eruption of earth from behind followed by the most shrill, screeching trill I’d heard in my life, a sound so piercing it caused my ear drums to twinge painfully in response. Then, what followed was what I can only describe as four legs heavily bounding off the dirt in intervals, each thump of the ground dangerously closer and louder than the last. That thing had to be size of a horse or bear based on how heavily it connected with the ground each time it landed, and judging by the breaks between landings I hazarded a guess whatever was behind us was clearing a good distance with each bound, and it was gaining *fast*. I dared not turn around – each root and tree I leapt over and swerved around threatened to bring me to a halt and if that happened, I was dead. I just focused on sprinting for my damn life. But the bounding only grew closer and closer, until I could hear enraged grunts and snorts as the pursuer drew near. I left the shovel back in the clearing and nothing else on my possession could be feasibly used as a weapon – I had to think of something, fast.

 

The camera drummed on my chest with each step I took, and that’s when an idea hatched. I grabbed the camera and hastily flicked through the settings to turn on the flash. Trying to split my attention between the run ahead and my camera, I activated a three second delay for the next picture taken. At that moment my foot caught a root - I stumbled but managed to maintain my balance and avoid falling face first without slowing down. I clicked the shutter release and spun the strap around my neck so that the camera was facing from my back - the next bound was so close to my rear that the impact kicked up debris into the back of my calves, and at that moment when I swear I could feel a warm, heavy breath waft on the back of my neck was when the camera flashed. The backlight from the flash illuminated the woods ahead in a split second, casting wild shadows across the tree trunks. I heard an otherworldly shriek as the flash went off, followed by the sound of a heavy mass falling to the ground and thrashing around violently, kicking up detritus as it threw whatever limbs or appendages it had around in a fit of either rage or confusion. I still didn’t dare to look behind me; I just kept sprinting ahead.

 

Evan and I made it to the dirt path and continued our sprint until we reached the cobblestone wall. I had to steady myself on the stone to catch my breath and took this moment to listen to my surroundings. My chest started to release a cold ache across my body as the exertion from sprinting caught up with me. Evan too had stopped and swiveled around to scan the tree line like a deer on high alert. The air was silent save for our laboured breaths and a distant car humming across the tarmac in the distance. There was no sign of movement in the shadows cast by the forest, no sound of bounding nor hideous screeching. The forest was silent.

 

“Evan… what the fuck… was that…” I panted through breaths.

 

“I don’t know,” he rasped. “Get in the car. I’m gonna drive us further into the village just in-case that thing’s still following us.”

 

I skirted around the back of the car, pulled the camera around to the front of my body again and sat in the front passenger seat. The two of us sat in silence for a moment before Evan turned the keys in the ignition. The car trundled through the neighbourhood for a few minutes, and every time we drove down a road adjacent to the cobblestone wall, Evan would slow to a crawl to watch out for any movement amongst the woods. Once I’d caught my breath the adrenaline spike faltered, and an overwhelming sensation of nausea, exhaustion and fear washed over me. My neck still tingled from the sensation of that… *thing’s* breath.

 

I held the camera in my trembling hands and stared at the blank screen. Whatever that thing was, there’s a damn good chance the camera took a picture of it; the monster that almost killed me, confined within a tiny screen. But the thought of opening my pictures rattled me; did I really want to know what was chasing us?

 

After a minute of deliberation, I reached a decision - I’d come this far for this moment, Hell I nearly died for this. I must know what was under that mound, what the source of the receding woods was. I scrolled through the camera options until I came to the picture folder and opened it. The second I laid eyes upon the latest picture taken, I let loose a withered gasp.

 

“What? What is it?” Evan said as he parked up. He lurched forwards over my shoulder. His eyes widened; jaw went slack. “Dear God…” he muttered.

 

Unsurprisingly, the picture was heavily blurred; the camera was swinging against my back during the snapshot - but it did capture something. One half of the frame was a blur of shadows and tree trunks that melted into the background on the righthand side of the picture, encapsulating the motion of the swinging camera and my frantic sprint. The other half was dominated by what I can only describe to be part of a pale, deranged looking face belonging to some kind of grotesque beast. Its face and what I assume was either its shoulder or body behind it was a greyish white, glowing with over-exposure from the flash; it was difficult to tell whether it was fur or skin from the picture alone. From its pointed snout a wide maw lined with jagged fangs gaped open, primed to latch onto its prey. One small, pink, pupilless eye could be seen glaring at the camera; the blurriness made it look like a small orb of fire fueled by pure rage. From atop its rounded head was the stump of what I assume was its left ear, but the rest of it was out of frame. The ear could resemble that of a hare based on what can be seen in the picture, but I couldn’t tell for certain. I studied the picture in silence for a few minutes. I was trying to absorb as much detail from the image as possible to try and recreate the beast in my head, but there was one thought that clouded all others: had this picture taken a second later, I’d be dead.

 

Once we were certain we weren’t being followed, I gave Evan directions to our house. I invited him in to recuperate and call the police about the situation, an offer he abruptly accepted; I think he just wanted to delay driving home alone at night after that ordeal. My hands were still trembled as I fumbled to get the keys into the front lock, but after a struggle of a few seconds it opened. The sight of Susan caused me to burst into tears as I rushed to embrace her.

 

Evan called the police and briefly summarised the incident to the operator. Around ten minutes later two policemen knocked on our door. Once they heard us detail the full events and I showed him the picture of the beast, it was painfully obvious that they were sceptics to say the least, but our desperation and state of shock when they began to cast doubt on our story must’ve swayed them into taking us seriously. They assured us that they would investigate the forest the following day, gave us a case number and left. Evan followed shortly after; I sent him off with a firm hug which included copious hearty back patting, then asked him to text me when he got back to his hometown. He agreed and also promised he’d call me tomorrow as well.

 

Susan heard the full story the same time as the police did. When I described how close the monster got to me, she broke down into tears as well. After dinner we retired to bed early for the night. The warmth of Susan nestled into my chest and Barney curled up on the blanket over my legs was what finally set me at ease somewhat. I kissed Susan on the head and whispered softly: “We’re gonna have to move again.”

 

Susan looked up from my chest and gave a sad smile. “I know,” she whispered, before kissing my cheek.

 

The day after the incident I got a phone call from Evan. Earlier on that same day, police patrolled the forest with Evan as their guide. They investigated the site of the mound but found only a mess of churned earth where it once stood. Our belongings were still there, although something polished off the peanuts I’d left behind. There was no sign of any large animal being in the area; Evan scrutinised the vicinity for tracks or markings but came up blank. Either the tracks were lost to the elements, or the creature somehow didn’t leave any trace behind. The police seemed to believe in the story less and less as the day went on, trying to explain away the incident as our imagination or a stray farm dog giving us chase or something. Evan tried to argue, but without further evidence there was nothing he could really say to persuade the police into taking him seriously.

 

“One last thing, Frank; I’m resigning from the Trust. No way in Hell can I go back into that forest after last night’s ordeal.”

 

“I don’t blame you, Evan,” I said with sadness. I could tell Evan truly loved this job, it was heart wrenching to see it come to an end like this.

 

“I’m gonna send out a warning to my colleagues and show them the picture of that beast you took. Maybe they won’t believe me like the police didn’t, I dunno. I’ve gotta try though, right?”

 

“Yeah, you’re doing the right thing. I’m going to start sending letters out to warn my neighbours; most if not all of them walk the forest frequently, they deserve to know what’s out there. After that, Susan and I are moving somewhere far *far* away. I don’t wanna be within fifty miles of that thing again.”

 

With that, we wished each other luck in our future endeavours and ended the call.

 

It’s been a couple of days since that fateful night.  I’m currently sat at our patio table sipping a cup of tea looking out into our garden. Susan’s whistling a tune as she tends to one of our flower beds a few steps away from me. Barney’s rolling around in the grass further down the lawn, limbs splayed out into the air, his mouth open and grinning at the sunny sky above. I regret that we’re going to have to leave this village, let alone our home. I’m dreading the time we’ll have to pour into finding a new place, selling our current house and packing all our things; time I fear we do not have.

 

I don’t know how I’m going to break this to Susan, but that flower bed is two millimetres further from the house than it was yesterday.
