As a kid, I always had these terrible nightmares. The kind that makes you question reality, like a vortex of madness pulling you into slumber every night.

From clowns jumping out of a matchbox toy play set like a clown car and eating you to the most incomprehensible concepts and landscapes, it's all there.

I had gotten home on a bright October day. Having had a long day, I simply made a cup of noodles and retired to my room. After many hours of gaming, I left my cup noodles half eaten on the desk and went to bed.

It took me a while to fall asleep, but eventually the sweet embrace of dark nothing took me in. Not remembering I was dreaming per usual, I found myself next to the ocean. What seemed to be traditional Japanese houses lined the coast for what appeared to go on for infinity.

The waves crashed behind me, and suddenly, as if on beat with nature, all the buildings lit up. Drawn in by the majestic glow of a paper lantern, I entered the closest one to me.

Walking in, you could tell there was a strange feeling in the air. The bright lanterns lining the wall, although welcoming, seemed almost ominous.

I approached the desk, finding a creature of which I'd never seen before. With a head like an upside-down pyramid, it simply gave me a blank slip of paper and pointed me to the door.

Entering the bright golden door, all I was met with was a hall. The longest hall I've ever seen in my life. So deep that the end appeared to be a black vortex.

At the realization of the depth of what I was seeing, I turned back to leave... finding nothing but an equally endless hallway.

Panic set in suddenly as I began to sprint frantically. Lantern after lantern passed by me in a flash as I rushed to escape this confinement.

Running myself to the point of exhaustion, I finally leaned my back against the wall and slid down to rest. That's when I noticed something strange... even stranger than this infinite hallway itself.

It was barely noticeable at first, but it began to get closer and closer. From the far end I came from the lanterns seemed to be extinguishing themselves. Followed in the darkness by a being I couldn't even see to describe.

Slowly the darkness crept in towards me, my unknown antagonist always just beyond that dark veil, pursuing me for reasons I couldn't conjure.

Breaking myself from the trance of watching the shadows, I finally stood back up and began my run once again despite the heaviness of exhaustion on my chest.

At that moment the entity began to run as well, giving chase in this endlessness. Words of ancient, inutterable chants reached me from behind, getting closer by the minute.

In my panic I tripped over myself and slammed headlong into the ground, drowned by the darkness I was trying so desperately to escape.

Whether I was out for a minute or days, I don't know. When I awoke, I felt as if I had fallen off my bed, but as I reached either way, all I felt was the walls of this nightmarish hallway.

"Tmp tmp tmp"

The footsteps of my pursuer sound off clearly from much closer than I'd like to have realized.

"Tmp tmp tmâ€¦"

The footsteps stop right beside me. Heated breath on my face, I lay frozen, unable to even imagine what sort of being stood above me.

I felt it wrap its hands around both of my arms and slowly grip tighter and tighter, lifting me up. It began shaking me. Harder and harder speaking those same chants I had heard earlier.

As if my eyes had been closed the whole time, I finally opened them to find my mother shaking me awake as I screamed uncontrollably.

When she finally calmed me down, the sunlight streaming in through my window overtaking the darkness almost seemed poetic from the visions I had experienced.
