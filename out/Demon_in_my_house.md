Hey guys, so I live in a fairly big house, I got a built-in movie theatre (projector broke) and it's completely black and sound proof.

Last night I was listening to my horror stories in total blackness as per usual, with my dog snoring outside the door and my dad on the other side of the house.  
My other dog had died 2 weeks ago, we had him put down because of the pain but he knew he was loved.

As I said, I was listening to the horror story, when I heard the door creak open very loudly, and then I heard something \*heavy\* step onto the leather couch, it wasn't human because today I tested to see what sound flat feet would make on the couch, it was more towards the sound of hoofs? I'm not too sure... But it was definitely something in the room.

Everything went quiet except for this

When the door opened, I heard  
\*STEP\*  
...  
\*STEP\*  
...  
\*STEP\*  
...  
\*STEP\*

Each step got closer and closer to me

And then it stopped. Something in my head told me "Don't move and don't make a sound, no matter what." and I even considered calling out to my dad, but listened to the voice in my head instead.  
Another word popped into my head immediately - "Demon" along with an image.  
It was an image of a tall (maybe 8 feet tall) white, pale creature. It was thin, the skin looked like that of a leper, diseased and raggedy, almost as if it was falling off. It had deer-like back legs, bent backwards at the knees and I didn't see it's feet in the mental image. The arms were long, almost as if it could run on all four limbs if needed. It had the bones of its vertebrae almost protruding from the skin. It had black hair covering its face.

After five minutes, the sounds of the house returned, and after another five minutes I got the courage to grab my phone and turn on the flash, it was empty and the door was closed as it had been, slightly ajar as I had left it.

Everything was in place except for one. Tiny. Thing.  
A dog treat, on the step of the entrance, in front of the closed door.

It sure as hell wasn't there before, and when I looked again today (I closed the theatre door and slept in the room with my dad instead) the biscuit was gone, and my other dog sure as hell didn't get it. And it was there! I took a picture of the treat before I left the room.

Some of you might say it was my dead dog visiting me to make me feel as though he's okay? But that isn't the case and I just "know it". The absolute terror and genuine fear I felt weren't that which I would feel for a beloved pet returning to assure me of his passing, instead it felt like I was prey being hunted.

I don't know if maybe it was trying to communicate its sympathies for me or was pitying me or taunting me, but my dad said that demons are pretty intelligent so I doubt it's the last one... Maybe it wants to communicate with me, although with the amount of fear I felt, I doubt it...

If it happens again I'll post again, but I doubt it, maybe this time I'll feel like attempting to communicate? I don't know.

This all happened last night.

Any help / advice / information about this would be really appreciated, I would also like to know if anyone knows just what this thing is and maybe where it comes from. This was my first encounter with this thing, I have had other supernatural encounters before, but all of them felt oddly warm and almost inviting.

This isn't some creepypasta, if some of you think that, because I know what I heard and felt and thought last night, I have no mental illnesses nor sleep deprivation and was definitely awake, I didn't imagine it either.

Sorry if I maybe did some repetition in the post
