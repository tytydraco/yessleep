I shouldn’t have gone hiking in the forest by my house. But it was hot out and I wanted to dip my feet in the creek. 

I had just started my lunch break when I squeezed through the gap in the chain link fence, cut through the trees, and found the water.

That’s when I heard a disturbing sound come from the bushes. 

Ka-crack.

It sounded like something being ripped apart, like bones or…

Ka-crack. 

I knelt behind a tree. Glanced over my surroundings to witness —

— Something huge framed between two pines. Hunched over its prey in mid-feast.

I couldn’t tell what it was, but it had horns, a long snout, and an arched back like it had endured years of hard labor. 

Whatever it was, it was feasting on something… 

I remained frozen, completely shocked by what I was seeing.

It wasn’t a grizzly bear… 

… or a mountain lion.

Ka-crack. Ka-crack. 

The animal devoured its catch, ravenous. 

I waited several seconds, then crept away, careful to not make any noise. 

I’d barely crawled out from the fence when I heard —

“What are you doing in there?”

I spun around and saw — 

— Ralph, my cranky war veteran neighbor. He was still in his bathrobe and slippers, sipping a mug of coffee.  

“Ralph!” I gasped. “I saw something… in the woods…”

“You’re not supposed to be back there.” 

“I know, but… it was—“

“Big like a bear?”

“Y-yes…”

“Hunched over?”

“Uh huh!”

“Had horns?”

I nodded.

“What you saw was the Jabber. Don’t ever go back there. If it knows you’ve seen it, it’ll hunt you down and kill you.”

What?!

Ralph shoved past me and continued on his walk. 

I was so shocked. I didn’t know how to respond. 

On my way back home, I wondered, Did that really happen? What was that animal? Why did Ralph know so much about it?

***

That afternoon I paced in my living room, contemplating Ralph’s words: “If it knows you’ve seen it, it’ll hunt you down and kill you.” 

I tried to remember what he called it: The Jabber!

But what was a Jabber?

I remembered the stories from my childhood, a legend forced on us kids to make us compliant. 

I rushed to my office. Started searching online. 

I was shocked to see thousands of gruesome, horrifying pictures. Each in some way looked like a cross between a wolf and a wendigo.

Beneath one photo was the text: “Old Wintu Legend.” 

This specific picture looked like the creature I saw. But it couldn’t be possible. 

These things weren’t real, right?

***

The next morning, I visited the historical society. I wanted to ask the owners about this animal. 

The place was run by an old Wintu named White Horn. I found him in the back organizing books.

“Excuse me, sir.” I said, trying not to appear desperate. “I’m looking for information on an old Wintu legend.”

“Ah, yes. Very popular subject.” White Horn set down his book. “Which legend?”

“The Jabber.”

As soon as the words left my mouth, his eyes narrowed: “What did you say?”

“The… Jabber?”

His eyes turned cold, with an expression more serious than death.

“Did it see you?” 

“No…”

“Does it know you’re looking for it?”

“I don’t think so —” 

He shoved me to the door.

“Wait — I want to know —“

“Go home and pray it never finds you.”

BAM. He shut the door after me, flipped the sign to “Closed.”

***

That night, while sautéing dinner and ruminating over the day’s events, I heard my sliding door open.

Ka-creak.

My body tensed. I reached for a knife. 

Ka-creak.

I poked my head into the living room.

It was Ralph. 

“Ralph, what are you —”

“Sit down.”  

He had a shotgun in his arms. 

“Why do you have a gun?!”

“I need to tell you something.” 

We moved into the garage. Ralph made sure the door was locked and the windows covered. He spoke in frightened whispers, like he’d been keeping a secret for years and was about to explode. 

“What I’m about to say cannot leave this room. Understand?”

I nodded vigorously. 

“It’s about the thing you saw.” He paused. “Years ago, this place used to be Wintu country. When the White Man came and drove the people away, something evil took their place.”

“The Jabber?”

Just hearing the name made Ralph flinch. 

“This creature lives in the woods. It’s a manifestation of the Wintu’s hate. If you’re lucky, it’ll move on to the next wilderness area before it realizes you’ve seen it. Just make sure you don’t tell anyone about it. The monster demands secrecy.”

“So that’s why no one talks about it.”

“Everyone who does ends up dead. If the Jabber knows you’ve seen it, it’ll kill you.” 

“Why hasn’t it hurt you?”

Ralph smirked and lifted his shirt to expose a nasty scar. “It tried once. But I gave it a headache it never forgot.” 

He tapped the shotgun at his side. 

“But here’s the real secret.”

He pulled a purple crystal out of his pocket.

“An old friend gave me this. It wards off evil spirits.” 

He offered it to me. 

“I keep them all over the house. Seems like you’ll be needing some now.”

*** 

After we finished talking, I let Ralph out the back. He pressed a finger to his lips.

“Remember, stay quiet. We don’t need any more problems in the community.”

Any more problems? I thought: How has this thing lived here for so long? How have I just now seen it?  

Ralph waved goodbye and meandered down the street. 

I watched him disappear, then returned to my kitchen, finished dinner, and got ready for bed. 

Around 10 PM, I heard a blood-chilling scream. Then, a gunshot.

I raced outside to find — 

— neighbors scrambling up and down our street.

I swiveled my gaze to each house. 

Then I saw it. An ambulance parked outside Ralph’s place.

I rushed over to June, my next door neighbor. She was clutching her chest, petrified beyond belief.

“I don’t know what happened. I heard Ralph rambling about something, then he shot himself.” 

I noticed she was wearing a necklace with a large purple crystal. An amethyst.

I reached into my pocket. Pulled out the gem Ralph had given me…

Coroners emerged from Ralph’s house, pushing a cart with a body bag. I couldn’t believe it. I had just talked with him. He didn’t seem suicidal.

After consoling June, I crept back into my driveway, mortified. 

I glanced back at Ralph’s house, sorrow filling my lungs. 

I could see something on the roof, almost hidden in the shadows —

I could barely make it out, but I swear —

— it had large horns, a hunched back, and a long snout. 

It was looking right at me.
