I grew up at the winkler schoolhouse in Cut Bank Montana. Well until I was 10 years old anyway, I learned a little about the schoolhouse and why it was called that but I’ll get to that later on. 
Part of the schoolhouse was turned into a shop for my father to work on vehicles, hang deer or elk that he harvested. 
I never thought much of it I’d only go out into the shop area when my father was out there, It was dark and spooky otherwise being the only lights were in the shop part of it. 

The schoolhouse consisted of 4 maybe 5 large rooms besides the shop, it was run down looking as we didn’t do much to the other rooms, one of the back small rooms was converted into a chicken coop with a small door that the chickens could leave to go out to the pasture if they needed. 
We had a pasture the size of a football field that had horses at one time. Caragandas surround the property, if you don’t know what those are, they are bushes that grow pretty big with thorns all over them. When I’d have friends over it would make great for places to hide during hide n seek. 

The house we lived in was 3 bedroom house about 10 feet from the old winkler schoolhouse. The schoolhouse hadn’t been used for school since the 1920’s thru the 1930’s. 
It was vacant since that time so a pretty old building besides the rooms I already mentioned, it had a basement or old boiler room, when it rained we would get salamanders in there because there was constant water on the floor about 3-12” deep. It was pitch black in that basement had to use flashlights even during daylight to direct your footsteps without falling. 

I converted the room next to the shop into a gaming room had an old tv with an extension cord to the shop to plug it in to play regular Nintendo or Super Nintendo on, yes this was the early 90’s when this happened, Anyway it was a dark rainy night when my mother n sister both came in pale as a ghost n breathing heavily into the house from the schoolhouse, my sister 7 years older than me I was 5 at the time. This got my heart racing asking what happened, they were going to look for something in the shop/schoolhouse. 

After they calmed down a little bit which seemed like an eternity, they said they were approaching the back room which contained the stairs to the basement. They heard moaning and what sounded like chains rustling as if a beast was chained up using its last bit of energy to try n free itself. 
They were curious so they put the flashlights on and made there way cautiously towards the stairs, The moans got louder, and as scared as they were they approached the top of the stairs. They could see a red animated glow and what they seen burned a memory into them for a lifetime.

It was a humanoid looking figure badly burned with red skin and yellow eyes chained to the wall. It looked right at them and said “get out now” taking the things advice they quickly ran back to the house to tell us what they had seen. My dad was still at work, being he worked two jobs and none of us were going to check to see what they saw.
They told me and my older brother the story and it was enough to have the hair on our neck stand up. 
None of us could sleep that night, my dad got home around midnight not believing the story went out there and well nothing was there but the standing water and salamanders.

A couple weeks went by and just before the clock struck midnight my mom and I were in the living room waiting for my dad to get home from work. She was on the phone the storm door was open about 10 feet away from us the screen door closed but it had a window in it. 
I was watching that window in hopes of seeing my dad walk thru, but what I seen still scares the crap out of me to this day. A tall red skinned thing with thin long white hair no facial features but big yellow eyes looking right at me. Wearing what looked like a big white sheet blowing in the wind. 

I quickly nudged my mom, “mom” “moooom” I said she looked at me and said “what son I’m on the phone” I said “look” and pointed at the door but nothing was there. 
She continued on the phone as I watched the screen door patiently expecting to see it again. Then all the sudden the screen door opened and closed on its own. Like that thing opened the door and came inside our house unseen. 
My mom watched in awe too speechless. We moved within the next six months never again to see or hear anything like that again. But we knew as a family that the winkler school house was haunted. And whatever I seen that night, got what it wanted, by either possessing me, or by gaining entrance into our home, or coming thru an inter dimensional portal, that pastors and priests somehow closed when they came out and blessed the property with holy water and verses from the Bible.

Before we moved I did something unknowingly thinking a chicken wanted to go for a swim I drowned it in a bucket full of solvent. My aunt was visiting at the time caught me but it was too late the chickens body went limp. She ran to the house telling my family I was some devil child. 
I couldn’t recall doing any of it.
I was told what I done was wrong but I had no feelings of remorse, it was a damn chicken for fuck sakes. 
The house on the property still stands to this day, but the schoolhouse was torn down back in 2003-2004. 
 Could it have been the work of that demon attaching itself to me? I have never been baptized, avoid church at all costs, and have an ultra religious sister whom I quit talking too, because all she does is talk about god and sends me religious sermons via Facebook. I can’t stand them I find that all religions are based off a book that man has written. I can still believe if I wanted without going to church or praying to god daily. 

I do believe in god, for the simple fact I know evil is out there and comes in many forms due to this occurrence that happened at a young age, as children we are more susceptible to seeing what adults cannot.
