So, there’s this house.

Kind of.

I dunno if you’d really call it that anymore. It was probably was, once. Some landowner’s gabled mansion sitting atop a hill and overlooking vast swaths of nature’s finest. Then maybe over time it was too expensive to run, so it became a convalescence home, or a sanitorium, or a motel. Truth is, I don’t know really know what it once was. I’m just painting a picture.

These days, it’s called the Halfway House. The ‘house’ part is up for debate, but *halfway*, well. Turns out, that’s right on the money. But I’ll have to explain some things before it makes sense to you, too.

I showed up at the Halfway House on November 17th, 1996. My first real memory of the place in steeped in exhaustion; hair wet, arms aching, looking around the lobby and feeling depressed. Gone were the days of upper-middle class grandeur. I was looking at a room dressed in thin brown carpet worn bald in patches, water-damaged ceiling tiles betrayed by the procession of blossoming mould, and a smell that lived between mildew and old soup.

The receptionist didn’t look up when I walked in, juggling two cardboard boxes and walking blind, entirely incapable of peering over the top. He made no move to assist, even as I crab-walked awkwardly towards him, breathing heavily.

‘Hi,’ I introduced myself, stooping to place the boxes carefully on the floor. ‘I’m Ray.’

The receptionist lowered the magazine he was reading and turned pale eyes towards me. To this day, I've only ever met the man once. He doesn't exactly keep to a schedule. I wouldn't even call him a receptionist, if the other's didn't. *The welcome party*, might be a better title. He's the most ordinary-looking guy in the world. So unremarkable, there's not a single person in this place who can describe him with any degree of confidence.

‘Ray,’ he echoed. Thin voice, hoarse. Like he didn't use it much.

‘Ray Toohey. I called ahead.’

He held up a finger, cut me off.

‘Oh, I know,’ he replied. He bent to rummage through a drawer for a moment, before emerging with a thin manila envelope. He flipped through its contents silently, until he gave a small, satisfied *‘aha’*, then settled back in his chair and began to read.

‘Ray Toohey,’ he repeated again, his pale eyes sliding down the page. ‘T-o-o-h-e-y. Hm, I see. Oh *my.’*

I remember standing there, feeling inexplicably anxious as he read whatever it was that was on that sheet. At the time, all I knew was that the Halfway place was some kind of shelter, which would inevitably host unusual characters within its walls. Maybe prospective residents had their police files pulled, in which case, I was fucked. But when he finished reading and slid the paper across the counter towards me, all I saw was a check-off list.

‘If you could just sign here to confirm you’ve picked up the key,’ he prompted, and produced said key from the pocket of his shirt as though it'd been there all day, just waiting for me. Large, bronze and almost comically stereotypical. 

I took the pen and scrawled my name in the messy block letters of someone who never finished school. I could feel his eyes on me as I marred the paper with my chicken-scratch scrawl, and when I looked up, he gave this crooked, satisfied smile, as if he were a car salesman and I, the moronic buyer who’d dropped a premium on a bucket of shit.

‘So,’ he said, getting to his feet and stepping out from behind the counter. He was short, his black trousers and button-down heavily creased and slightly musty, as though he’d forgotten he was working that day and sourced them from the bottom of a laundry basket. ‘What’d you do to end up in this place?’

He didn’t wait for my reply, just bent down to pick up one of my boxes and set off in the direction of an elevator, a dingy flickering light reflecting off its battered chrome surface.

‘What do you mean?’ I asked, hurriedly bending over to scoop up the remaining box and trotting after him. ‘What did I *do?’*

‘Yes,’ he said, lifting one leg and jabbing the elevator button with the worn toe of a scuffed loafer. The button let out a reluctant ding, followed by the groan of pulleys grinding somewhere in the guts of the building. ‘Nobody ends up here if they had a choice in the matter.’

I remember glancing around the lobby and thinking he had a point. The Halfway House had the defeated air of a place that had given up trying.

‘This place is just temporary,’ I replied.

I'd honestly believed that, too.

‘Uh-huh,’ replied the receptionist in a tone that suggested he’d heard it all before—'cause he probably had. ‘Well, you’re in good company.’

'Just a building full of degenerates, huh?'

He gave a little laugh. ‘Well, that remains to be seen.’

The elevator opened with a reluctant *ding*. We stepped inside. The space was barely large enough for the two of us. There was graffiti scratched into the surface in jagged loops: names, numbers, a few slurs, and a total of six floors you could choose from. At the bottom was a single button labeled *B1*, the sticker half-peeled.

The fifth floor button lit up under his thumb.

‘Got a name?’ I asked awkwardly as we began our ascent.

‘No,’ he said. So we rode in silence.

*Ding.* The elevator shuddered to a stop, and the doors began to creak open—only to hesitate, then slowly inch shut again.

‘This way,’ the receptionist muttered, jamming his foot between them and kicking the doors apart with a practiced sort of violence. He shouldered his way out without a glance back.

I followed, wedging myself through the narrow gap, the box in my arms bumping the frame. *He’s an asshole,* I decided. This is a sentiment that has yet to change.

The hallway beyond was just as cheerless as the lobby. A jaundiced row of ceiling bulbs cast everything in sickly yellow light, and the carpeting, a mottled weave of brown and mustard, smelled faintly of mildew.

We walked all the way to the end of the hall, stopping in front of a door the colour of dried blood, its patinaed brass plaque reading: **9**.

‘Here were are—oh, for gods sake,’ the receptionist muttered, looking down.

I was ahead of him in this, already shifting from foot to foot, listening to the thick carpet squelch beneath my feet. It was wet.

The receptionist unceremoniously dumped my box on the ground, then took two side-steps across the narrow corridor and rapped sharply on the neighboring door, number 10. The numbers hung crooked on their plate, one screw missing, so the whole thing dangled.

After a few seconds, the door creaked open. A pale, mousey woman poked her head through the gap, her hair limp, her expression so soft and automatically apologetic it was like she’d been born that way.

‘The kids are asleep,’ she whispered, voice feather-light. Her eyes flicked to me, and a faint smile surfaced. ‘Oh, hello! Are you my new neighbour?’

‘Yeah,’ I said, trying to peer past the receptionist. ‘I’m—’

‘Ms. Reid, the carpet is wet again,’ he interrupted.

‘What? No, I fixed it! Just a few days ago, I swear!’ Her eyes darted down to the sodden carpet and her face fell. ‘I haven’t noticed any—’

‘Get this sorted, Ms. Reid,’ the receptionist snapped. ‘I won’t have disorder in the Halfway House.’

The way he said it—*disorder*—like it was a slur, made my jaw tighten.

‘Shouldn’t that be… I mean, if it’s the plumbing, isn’t that the building’s responsibility?’ I asked, feeling my voice grow small even as I pushed forward. ‘That’s… like, tenant law, right?’

They both looked at me. The receptionist’s expression didn’t shift, but the temperature in the hall dropped.

‘This isn’t the sort of problem a plumber can fix,’ he said, eyes still locked on Ms. Reid. ‘The solution lies with *you*.’

Then he turned his back on the distraught woman, his expression cold. ‘Ready to go inside?’

Before I could answer, he turned and walked back to door 9.

Ms. Reid lingered in her own doorway, her shoulders slumped, toes turned inward like a chastised schoolkid. I gave her a look that was meant to be sympathetic but probably came off more like a grimace. She returned it in kind, then gave a limp wave and closed the door softly behind her.

The receptionist waited while I fished the key out of my back pocket, my box balanced precariously on one knee. After a fumbling few seconds, the lock gave way with a sticky click and I pushed the door open.

The apartment was a one-bed, one-bath unit. Small. It might have been charming once. Now it just looked tired.

‘Well,’ I said, trying and failing to muster some optimism. ‘It’s not too bad.’

‘Give it time,’ replied the receptionist with a little smile. ‘Now, you’ve met Ms. Reid, she lives opposite. She had two children, but I wouldn’t worry, they don’t make too much noise. Directly beside you is Dale. Happy for a chat, that one. Been here for a while. Most people come and go, cycle through, but not Dale. A Halfway veteran, he likes to call himself. If you have any questions, he’s your guy.’

‘Aren’t I better off just heading down to the front desk?’ I asked.

‘Why would that be better?’

‘Well, so I could ask *you*.*’*

‘Oh no,’ he shook his head, dismissing my suggestion as though it were a vaguely irritating fly. 'No, this is your mess to sort out.’

My stunned silence was ignored, and he followed it up with: ‘Right. I’ll leave you to get settled in. Need anything else before you get started?’

‘Uh,’ I said, the litany of questions I had stored in my brain annoyingly absent now that I needed them. I supposed there was always tomorrow. ‘No, I’m good.’

The receptionist nodded and headed for the door.

‘Thank you,’ I added to his retreating back, unwilling to make enemies.

The receptionist lingered a moment too long in the doorway, his hand resting lightly on the frame. He didn’t look around the apartment. He didn’t offer a ‘not a problem’ or a ‘good luck.’ Just stood there, backlit by the dim hallway light, as if considering whether to say something else.

Then he nodded once, absently, like he’d settled a private thought, and left. I kicked the door shut behind him. The apartment swallowed the sound.

I set my box down on the cracked kitchen counter and stretched the ache from my arms. The light switch fought back with a reluctant *click*, and the kitchen light buzzed on.

Unpacking didn’t take long. Two measly boxes contained everything I owned. A Bible, bound in old leather with a spine worn soft as fabric. Pots and bowls, forks and spoons. Some clothes, mostly thrifted. A chipped mug. A bar of luxury soap wrapped in wax paper I’d smuggled out of a gift shop.

And a framed photo I’d wrapped in a dish towel. I sat it on the kitchen counter, stared at it a moment. Then turned it around, so that the occupants faced the yellowing tile of the backsplash.

The bedroom was empty but for the mattress, already in place, no sheets. I spent some time unpacking and refolding what little I had in the way of manchester, making the bed and putting the rest away in the cupboard. By the time I was finished the sun outside was beginning to dim.

The bathroom mirror had warped around the edges, like water had gotten in behind the glass. I turned the tap on. Water gurgled and spat out in thick brown spurts, then cleared.

I filled the sink and splashed my face. That’s when I smelled it.

Gasoline.

Not strong, not enough to panic. I checked the stove. Electric coils. No pilot light, no gas line that I could see. I even opened the cabinets, half-expecting to find a leaking can, nothing. I sniffed my sleeve. Nothing there, either. Just in the air.

*It happens,* I thought. Old building, probably soaked into the walls.

Eventually, I decided I couldn’t go another day in the same clothes. I’d been sleeping in bus stops for the better part of a week.

I gathered my dirty laundry. Shirt, jeans, socks rolled like stones in a grocery bag. I left my unit, taking care to lock the door behind me, and walked back to the elevator. A yellowing guide was tacked beside the metal doors.

**BASEMENT LEVEL 1 – LAUNDRY / STORAGE**

I pressed the call button. The elevator moaned, then clicked open like it had been waiting.

I stepped inside, alone. The mirror in the back wall was cracked, spider-webbed from an old impact. It gave my reflection a dozen extra faces—mine, but fractured and stretched.

I looked away and jabbed the ‘B1’ button. The elevator groaned to life and I began to descend. Overhead, the fluorescent light gave a single, lazy flicker before settling back into a dim buzz.

I leaned towards the mirror and started picking at a small blemish that had been forming all week.

That’s when I felt it.

A heat at my back. Not the kind that comes from old wiring or a bad air vent, this was the kind you feel when someone’s standing just a little too close behind you on a crowded train. Except I was alone in an elevator.

And then I heard it. Faint and wet and coming from nowhere: a low, breathy sobbing.

My hand froze mid-pick. I stared hard at myself in the mirrored panel on the elevator wall, heart climbing its way up my throat. I didn’t move. The pressure behind me increased, grew warmer, more solid. Something hot, puffing and damp, coated the back of my neck.

I looked.

And for one, blinking heartbeat, she was there.

A woman standing directly behind me.

Just the briefest, fleeting glimpse of her. Pale, dark hair, a horrible face staring back at me, her left eye bulging out of its socket, jaw hanging slack like someone had taken a crowbar to it. When she sucked in breath, blood bubbled from a hole in her neck.

I screamed and spun, hand flying up like I could block whatever was about to happen.

But there was nothing, just the empty chrome of the elevator, the humming light, the cold.

I stood there panting. My meds maybe wearing thin. Thought maybe I’d been off them longer than I realized.

*I was an idiot then, I'm an idiot now.*

The elevator shuddered to a stop. The doors groaned open, revealing the damp-smelling dark of Basement One. I practically threw myself out and watched the elevator doors close after me, making sure nothing followed.

Basement One had the still air of forgotten places. Cement pillars cast long shadows under dim fluorescent lights, half of them blinking or dead. Storage cages stretched out in narrow rows, chicken wire enclosures padlocked and filled with mouldy treasures like mattresses, broken prams and soggy cardboard boxes.

The laundry room was tucked into the back corner, a metal door propped open with a brick. Inside, the space was narrow and lined with old linoleum. Four washers, four dryers. Each coin-operated with instructions half worn off from a decade of fingernails scratching over the plastic.

I dumped my clothes into a washer and patted my pockets for change. Found a few coins. Not enough.

Muttering, I crouched to check under the machine for a stray quarter. That’s when I heard it: *ding*.

The elevator.

I straightened up, brushing off my knees. Probably someone else doing a late load. I stepped to the doorway and peeked around the frame, expecting to see a neighbour wheeling a basket.

The elevator doors stood open at the far end of the basement, but no one stepped out.

No footsteps. No voices. Just the slow mechanical exhale of the elevator doors beginning to close again. They sealed shut with a sound like teeth clicking together.

I retreated back into the laundry, definitely on edge, cursing creepy old elevators and damp, tiny apartments and bitchy receptionists and a life of hard knocks and evangelical parents and the stupidity of youth and wasted potential and forced myself to dig around for more coins, hating everything.

Once I’d found enough I shoved my clothes in the open mouth of the most reliable-looking washing machine I could find and fed in the coins.

When I looked up, there was a man standing in the doorway.

I hadn’t heard him come in. No jingle of loose change, no cough, no rustle of footsteps over concrete. Just there, still and silent, framed by the weak light and the darker corridor beyond.

It was apparent from the offset that this man was unwell. Not a tweaker, exactly, but not all there either, something half-fried behind the eyes. I knew the type. Had lived around them, with them, *been* them once or twice in another life. Broken minds tend to cluster.

He was twitchy, kept jerking his head to the side as though constantly responding to a voice sounding from right behind him. His skin glistened with sweat despite the chill, a sickly sheen that caught in the laundry light.

Then, without warning, he walked right over and sat down beside me, despite the empty stretch of bench next to us. We sat so close our shoulders almost touched.

‘The air is nice up here,’ he said suddenly.

I shifted away, subtle as I could.

I gave a non-committal grunt, trying to discourage him from talking to me further, but too cautious to cause outright offense. Something wasn’t right behind his eyes. He smelled sour, like he hadn’t washed in a while. Had shadows so dark beneath his eyes they looked permanent.

‘Yeah,’ the man nodded and wiped his running nose along the back of his sleeve. ‘It’s nice.’

‘I guess,’ I muttered. ‘Bit musty.’

‘Nah, I love mustiness,’ he replied, apparently oblivious to the absurdity of this conversation. ‘I’m tired of open fields and summer air.’

‘Fair enough.’

We fell silent. It was in this silence that I noted he did not carry any laundry of his own. No other machines were in use, no sopping pile awaiting transfer to a dryer—he had no obvious reason of being there. His leg jiggled like a jackhammer beside mine.

We sat like that for a while. He twitched. I tried to think of excuses to get away.

Then he asked: ‘What’d you do to end up here?’

‘Sorry?’

‘What’d you do?’ he repeated, louder this time. The nodding had stopped. His eyes were locked on mine now, too hard and too bright. ‘Everyone’s done something.’

‘Huh? Oh—’ I recalled the receptionist asking the same question*.* I remember thinking, *damn, this place has to be really bad. Were there bed bugs? Black mould? Crack addicts littering the stairwell?* ‘Just trying to get back on my feet. I shouldn’t be here long.’

‘No,’ he said, his voice suddenly sharp. ‘I mean, what did you *do?’*

‘I dunno what you mean.’

He picked up his incessant nodding, staring at me like one would a curious bug. Suddenly, he clicked his fingers as though experiencing a private *eureka!* moment. ‘New are you?’ he asked.

‘Yeah.’

‘What floor?’

‘Five.’

‘Ah,’ he replied. ‘That’s not so bad. Not like me. I’m floor two. Doesn’t get worse than that. Well, except floor one. But I’ve never met anyone that lives on floor one.’

‘So… two’s bad, huh?’ I asked, not knowing what else to say.

The nodding started again. Faster now. I could hear the clicking of his neck with every dip. ‘Oh yeah. Two’s real bad.’

A few more minutes trickled by, and my patience for entertaining the madman burnt through the last of its fuel. I climbed to my feet, deciding I’d pick up my load early in the morning, figured it wouldn’t smell too bad if I left it for a few hours.

‘Well,’ I said. ‘It was nice to meet you—’

His hand clamped around my wrist.

Not painful, but firm, wouldn’t have been able to buck him off without some fight. His eyes searched mine with a wild kind of desperation. When he spoke again, his voice was soft.

‘I’m really sorry,’ he whispered.

‘It’s chill, dude, you didn’t do—’

‘But I did,’ the pressure of his grip increased. I winced. ‘You don’t understand how sorry I am. I think about it all day, I think about it all night. I ain’t slept in *years*. But I don’t need those dreams, you understand, ‘cause I’ve never woken up. I’m sorry. Oh God, hear me, I am sorry. I want it end. I want out. I know I did bad, I know it, okay? So I’m gonna go, man. Yeah, I think I’m done. I’m gonna go, and I don’t want you stopping me*, okay?’*

My mind was blank. What the hell were you supposed to say in this situation?

‘Okay?’ he repeated, now squeezing me so hard my knees buckled slightly.

‘Yeah, yeah, okay,’ I nodded rapidly, wincing. ‘Fine with me, dude.’

He stood and released me, sudden and sharp. I jerked back, stumbled, landed hard on the bench again. He didn’t notice. Or maybe he didn’t care.

‘I think it’s time I go now,’ he said.

‘Okay,’ I replied, voice thin. ‘Good night.’

He turned halfway to the darkened garage, then looked over his shoulder, still nodding. ‘I hope this place is kinder to you.’

And then he stepped into the shadows.

No footsteps. No creak of the elevator. Just silence. And then, after what felt like a full minute, his head popped around the corner again like a jack-in-the-box and I jumped, heart skipping like a needle on a record.

‘It’s getting late,’ he said. ‘I’d take the stairs, if I were you.’

Then he was gone.

*What the shit?*

The washer dinged first. Then the dryer. I sat through both, curled up on the cracked plastic chair with my face in my hands. Eventually, I closed my eyes. The hum of machines and the warm gusts of dryer air carried me into a shallow nap. When I blinked back awake, the laundry was done.

I gathered my things and made my way back toward the elevator, footsteps echoing. I hit the call button and waited. Watched the floor numbers slide slowly down.

3…

2…

1…

The doors didn’t open.

They just stopped. Stuck, like the thing had given up halfway. I pressed the button again. Nothing. Not even a whir. Not even a ding. And then I heard the man’s voice again, not out loud but deep in the space behind my ribs: *It’s getting late. I’d take the stairs, if I were you.*

I stared at the elevator. Then at the hallway behind me. Then back at the elevator. My hand hesitated over the call button once more, before dropping.

At this point in time, I wasn’t a superstitious man. But I also thought it best to hedge my bets.

The stairwell door was rusted at the hinges and opened with a squeal when I stepped in. It was empty, silent, save for the gentle drip of some unseen leak echoing down the stairwell’s throat.

I climbed slowly, balancing the laundry basket on my hip. One flight. Two.

When I reached the landing marked *Floor 2*, I hesitated.

This was his floor. Where the man from the laundry lived. *Floor two. Doesn’t get worse than that*, he’d said.

I should’ve kept walking. But curiosity, well, it’s like an itch behind your eyes. You know scratching it will make it worse, but you scratch anyway.

I reached for the door.

The hallway beyond looked completely ordinary. Identical to mine on Floor 5. Same yellowed wallpaper, same threadbare carpet, same sickly fluorescent buzzing overhead. No smell of sulphur. No screams from behind locked doors.

I stepped through anyway, walked the length of the hallway. Apartment numbers, most with the same worn-out ‘NO JUNK MAIL’ stickers. I paused outside one unit that had a dead plant outside its door, all crisp brown leaves and bone-dry soil, but otherwise, nothing caught my eye. Maybe every tenant thinks their floor is the worst.

I rounded a corner.

A door was open at the end of the corridor. Just barely, just enough to see the slice of darkness behind it. The carpet outside the apartment was darker too. Wet. Spongy underfoot, like someone had spilled a bucket of water that hadn’t dried. I wondered if the pipe problem plaguing Ms. Reid on floor five was down here, too.

I looked up and down the corridor for a sign of life, some evidence that the tenant was nearby. Nobody in their right mind would leave their door unlocked in a place like this; the crumbling walls and yellow stains painted a vivid and undeniable picture of the kinds of people that lived in the Highway House, myself included. A sliver shy of homeless, probably hungry, probably angry, and definitely poor.

I gave the door a gentle knock and it creaked open further at my touch.

‘Hello?’ I called. No response.

I pushed it fully open, the hinges groaning with slow, arthritic complaint.

The apartment was wrecked.

Not messy, wrecked. Furniture flipped. Broken glass glittered in the carpet. A TV was lying face-down in a pile of clothes. There were bottles everywhere, some empty, some still weeping liquor onto the ground. The smell was a mixture of stale sweat, rot, and something sour. Like a fridge had died and no one noticed.

I should’ve turned around right then. But my feet moved on their own, carrying me in through the detritus.

I found the man from the laundry in the bathroom.

He’d used a belt and looped it over the curtain rod, the kind that was barely screwed into the drywall to begin with. It had held, somehow. He hung there with his back to the tiled wall, feet just shy of the floor, toes pointed down like he might’ve changed his mind at the last second and tried to touch earth again.

The sound that came out of me wasn’t a scream. More like the breath caught sideways in my throat and tried to leave as a word, but found nothing worth saying. I turned too fast and caught my knee on the edge of a fallen laundry basket, pitching forward. I stumbled, only just stopped myself from stumbling straight into the dead guy.

The basket had tipped, spilling its contents in a slow-motion avalanche across the floor.

Not laundry. Paper.

Loose sheets, some stained, some folded and refolded to softness. Legal documents, envelopes splotched with old water damage, carbon copies, receipts. The kind of documentation that follows a life lived off-grid and underfoot.

And then, a journal.

I stood there for a while, trying to avoid the feeling of the dead man hanging just inches from my back. I knew I ought to get help. That I had no business rifling through the private belongings of the poor, unstable dead man I’d been talking to just an hour earlier.

Then, without really deciding to, I reached out, turned the journal over and opened to the first page. It read:

>*‘My name won’t save me, so it don’t matter. What matters is that on February 2**^(nd)**, 1986, I murdered them Buchanan girls, just eight and eleven at the time. What follows is a guide to basement levels two through eighty-four of the Halfway House.’*
