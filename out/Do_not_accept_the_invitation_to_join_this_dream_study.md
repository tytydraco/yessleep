“Are you ready?” the lab assistant asked.

“Never been more ready” I replied. I looked to my right. Katherine had also put on the helmet. To my left, Hector was fiddling with his. To his left, Steven had put his on and was waiting for it to activate.

The neurosurgery department at our university was making breakthroughs with a new piece of technology that they thought would be revolutionary. It was a machine that, when put to your head, can totally immerse you in another space. When multiple machines are connected, it could allow you to explore the dreams of other people. I heard that gaming companies and police investigators were already eyeing the entire project.

Me, Hector and Katherine were a group of friends in college. We met each other through a class camping trip and had many things in common. One of which was that we were all broke college students, so when the professor handed out flyers for taking part in a dream experiment, we all agreed. I meant $300 for half a day’s worth of lying around on some brain machine? Easy money. At least that was what I thought.

Me and my friends were pumped to explore each other’s dream. The only odd one out was Steven. The team of scientists said something about wanting to test different relationship dynamics when multiple people are connected, so we reluctantly agreed. We knew nothing of Steven, but he looked harmless enough. Also joining us was Professor Wilkin – the entire machine was his brainchild. He wanted to showcase how confident he was in his creation by being among the first to experience it.

Our contraptions were fastened. The scientists gave us a small pill and told us it was to aid in our sleep. It smelled of mint. Once we were all finished, the scientists told us to just lie still and the machine would take care of the rest.

“Once more unto the breach, dear friends” Professor Wilkin said before we began. After a couple of minutes, my hands and feet got tingly. Then, the scenery outside started to blur and I fell asleep.

I opened my eyes. The scenery was a mix of purple and orange haze. I pinched myself; the stinging sensation was distant but present. I was standing near a water fountain that spouted purple water. I walked around for a while before finding an old man, playing a guitar. His hands were strumming, but no sound came out of the guitar. Instead, colorful shapes of notes flew out and dissipated into the air.

“Where am I” I asked the old man. There was no sound. Instead, the words flew out in letters of various fonts.

“Where music is silent” the old man replied, the word “music” turning all sorts of different colors.

I left the old man and searched around. Soon, I found Hector. He was watching a team of mermaids near a purple lake singing out their notes, the shapes of their notes round and long. I patted him on the back. He turned back and put a finger across his mouth in a “shh” motion. I asked him anyway whose dream he thought this belonged to. He turned back and said “Isn’t it obvious, it’s Katherine’s.” and he pointed towards the middle of the mermaid group. Katherine was sitting there, singing and brushing her hair. In real life she was a brunette, but in this dream her hair was scarlet red. The words flying over our heads alarmed the group of mermaids and they dove underwater. Katherine saw us and her fish lower body turned to legs. She walked towards us.

“How are you guys finding my dream?” she asked, her words appearing a mix of purple, pink and orange.

“Interesting” me and Hector said in unison and our words collided before disappearing like a puff of smoke. We walked around for a while before the sky started pulsating. The colors started shifting to a green hue. We found Dr. Wilkin next to a small lake, he was standing on the side, observing something. As we got closer, we realized what was happening. Steven was beating up a mermaid. He stomped on her fish tail, slapped her face and touched all over her. The mermaid was still smiling and didn’t seem to react to his actions. Seeing us, he stopped.

“What the fuck do you think you are doing?” Katherine asked, her words were red hot.

“What do you care? It’s not real. Nothing we do inside here is,” Steven answered. He stood up and gave the mermaid a final kick before approaching us.

“It’s still my dream you creep,” Katherine said. “Why didn’t you stop him?” she faced the professor.

“I’m strictly here to observe,” he answered. His words were plain white.

Katherine moved as if to say something. Then a door appeared from nowhere. It was just like a regular wooden door, except it had no handle. The door opened.

“You guys coming?” Steven asked and walked in first. We soon followed and the professor walked in last.

The sounds returned. In fact, they were the first of my senses that I felt. I opened my eyes. I was in a cubicle. Surrounding me are the sounds of keyboards and mice, clicking away in a constant drum. The colors drained away. Everything was black and white and drab grey. I stood up and looked over the panels. All around me were cubicles, as far as the eye could see. The people were all wearing short-sleeved shirts, black pants and grey ties. They all had the same hairstyle, but none of them had a face. Or they had faces but no features, no eyes, no nose, no mouth and no brows. I leaned over and asked one of them where I was. He made a shush motion before going back to the blank computer screen, clicking away endlessly.

I walked around for a bit before hearing some commotion. It sounded like arguing. I approached the noise. It was Katherine. She was arguing with one of the faceless workers. I tapped on her shoulder. She turned back, startled.

“Damn, you scared me. I was arguing with this moron, there’s no point to him working. It’s not real. He wouldn’t listen,” she gestured to the worker who had returned to his screen. “Strange place huh, whose dream do you think this is?”

“Let me see, endlessly repetitive work. Boring desk job. Colorless world. Pretty sure it’s Hector’s dream”

“Where is he anyway? How can someone’s dream be so boring?”

“Guessing this is more of a nightmare. Come one, let’s find him,” I told her.

We soon found Steven. He was, once again, beating on someone - a worker this time, smashing up his computer, using the keyboard to hit him in the face and cursing him out.

“What’s his problem? Will this guy just destroy everything wherever we go?” Katherine asked me. I shrugged. Steven was a riddle. None of us knew anything about him, save for Professor Wilkin. My guess was that they chose a violent man to see how we would react to him in our dreams.

On seeing us, Steven gave the worker one final punch and stood up.

“Hey, found your guy, but he’s busy” he said and gestured to a direction with 4 long lines of people all converging on one point. We skipped through the line and received boos and yells from the workers in line. When we arrived at Hector’s cubicle, he was typing away at his keyboard, his fingers punching the key like he was angry. He seemed like he was filling out a form on the computer screen. As soon as he was done with one form, the people at the top of the line soon gave him 4 more. The pile at his desk grew so tall that it touched the ceiling, but Hector wasn’t done typing. Besides him, Professor Wilkin was again observing without saying anything. His eyes followed Hector’s movements.

We arrived. I tapped Hector on the shoulder. He didn’t react. Katherine did the same thing. Still no reaction. He was typing away, his eyes focused on the computer screen.

“Gotta finish the forms” he muttered.

At that moment, Steven jumped in and kicked the computer screen to pieces. Hector snapped out of what he was doing and looked at us. He looked terrified.

“Oh my god, thank you for getting me out of that” he told Steven and even shook his hand. Steven gave us a self-assured look, as if taunting us that his violence actually helped.

Soon, another door opened. This one was made of old wood with the finish full of scratches. We followed the door and as always, Professor Wilkin was last.

I opened my eyes. I was lying in a child’s bunkbed. I felt small. Somehow, I fitted into the mini bed. I put my hand in front of me. My fingers were small and tubby. I was definitely a child again.

“Hey, anyone else here?” a voice rang out. It was Hector’s. What was strange was that the voice sounded adult-like.

“I’m here,” I answered with my own voice, feeling the treble and the bass ringing. Yep. No doubt about it. I was a child with the voice of an adult.

“Where the hell are we?” Hector asked.

I looked around. We were in what looked like a regular child’s bedroom. There was a wardrobe, a book case, a desk, some posters of Paul Bunyan and one that reads: “American Tall Tales: Paul Bunyan” with an image of him carrying a deer on his shoulder.

I jumped down from the bunk bed. Hector rose up from the bed beneath mine. He had short hair that looked like they were beginning to turn brown. On seeing each other, we broke out laughing. I guessed seeing tiny version of ourselves was an unintended side effect of the dream machine. Soon, Katherine walked in. Her hair had reached a bit below her ears. She wore a yellow dress. We laughed at each other for a while.

“Steve, you home?” a harsh voice called from downstairs. No one answered.

“Steve, where are you? Don’t let me come up there, boy,” the harsh voice repeated, the sounds slurred. It sounded like whoever said it was three sheets to the wind.

We heard sniffles. It came from the wardrobe. Katherine opened it. Inside it was a boy. I realized it was Steven, though what confidence he had was gone. He was cupping his hands to his face and crying.

“Steven, is that your father calling you?” I asked him. His hands were still cupping his face and started shaking.

“Stepfather” he replied.

“Steven goddamn it you dumb ass. You forgot to mow the lawn again” the voice was closer and closer. The sound of feet striking the wooden stairs reverberated throughout the room and made Steven jump. The door sprang open. A man walked in. He was a mountain of meat wearing jeans with a belt and a checkered shirt. His beard was thick and smelled of alcohol. He looked just like Paul Bunyan. To us, the man looked like a giant. He pushed through us all and looked around the room. There were sniffles again. The man turned to the wardrobe and found Steven, who cried louder. In the commotion, I realized that right behind the man was Professor Wilkin. He was still an adult.

“What did I tell you? You mow the goddamn lawn when I told you to. You disobeyed. Do you know what that means?” Steven’s stepfather asked and took off his belt. Steven put up his arms to cover his head. We moved to stop him, but he pushed us away like toys with just a simple wave of his arm.

Then he started hitting Steven. *Swish. Thwack. Swish. Thwack*. The sounds were crisp and clear. The man brought up the belt, holding the buckle. Then he brought it down. *Swish. Thwack. Swish. Thwack*. With each strike, Steven’s arms grew redder and redder until they bled. The man only stopped after that. He gave Steven a final warning look before going away.

Steven got up and got out of the wardrobe.

“I’m so sorry,” Katherine said.

“It’s nothing,” Steven replied.

We stood around for a good while. Then, another door opened. Katherine turned to Steven and asked him before we entered.

“I know it’s awful to ask, but why did you dream of mermaid when your step father was hitting you?”

“What do you mean? I’m not thinking about some girly mermaid in my dream.”

“Because I saw them in the other room.” Katherine replied. At this, Professor Wilkin’s face darkened.

“Are you absolutely sure that you saw a mermaid? Like the ones in your dream?” the professor asked.

“Pretty sure yeah”

“Then maybe the spillover effect happened” Professor Wilkin sounded serious.

“What’s the spillover effect?” I asked him.

“It’s only a theory, but it’s when dreams spill over and start affecting each other.”

“Why didn’t you tell us about this before we went in?” Katherine asked.

“This is the first time for a lot of things. I’m sorry, I’ll adjust the machine when we get out.”

“When are we getting out of this anyway?” I asked him.

“When we have visited all of our dreams. We got two left. Yours and mine,” he looked at me.

We walked through the door. The landscape was desolate. I immediately looked at myself. I was a cartoon character. The shapes that made up my body were constantly moving and reshaping just like a cartoon. I spoke and there was sound, but there were also shapes of letter above my head. Soon, I found Hector. He was also drawn like a cartoon character, with shapes constantly moving. He was watching a team of mermaids near a purple lake singing out their notes, the shapes of their notes round and long. I patted him on the back. He turned back and put a finger across his mouth in a “shh” motion.

Wait, this felt familiar. I asked him anyway whose dream he thought this belonged to. He turned back and said “Isn’t it obvious, it’s Katherine’s.”

“Wait a minute, I told you that already,” he added, his face perplexed.

“Trippy. Let’s go find the others” I told him. We walked around for a while before finding an old man surrounded by mermaids. We approached the old man, asking him where we were. But before we could reach him, the mermaids looked up. They all had the same hairstyle, but none of them had a face. Or they had faces but no features, no eyes, no nose, no mouth and no brows. They said in unison “where music is silent” before dragging us both down. Our lower bodies slowly sunk into the ground and before I could notice, I was once again in an office, surrounding me were the sounds of keyboards and mice, clicking away. I stood up and pinched myself. The sensation was distant but present. Hector was in the next cubicle and he jumped over to mine.

I stood up and looked to the center. There were endless lines of bearded men, mountains of meat each wearing jeans with a belt and a checkered shirt. They all looked like Paul Bunyan. They were lining up, belts in their hands. Steven was in the center, where the lines converged. The men at the front of the lines were beating on him. *Swish. Thwack. Swish. Thwack.* After they were done, they were replaced by those behind them. We approached to stop the beating, but soon the men dragged us down, our lower body sinking to the ground. Steven sunk too.

I opened my eyes. I was a child again. My fingers were small and tubby. Next to me, Hector became a mermaid, his face a mismatch with the rest of his body. I spoke, but my words were slurred together as if I was drunk. Hector’s mouth spoke, but only words flew out. We walked on to find others.

Soon, we saw the sounds of “Pow”, “Whack”, “Thud”. And we saw who was behind it. Professor Wilkin was beating on a mermaid.

“What the fuck do you think you are doing?” I asked him.

“What do you care? It’s not real. Nothing we do inside here is,” he answered and as if realized something, stopped and looked at us. I looked at the mermaid, she was Katherine. Her facial features seemed to change by the second, swirling around like a Rorschach test.

“I’m so sorry. This wasn’t supposed to happen,” he said.

“What is going on?” Hector asked him, his words a wobbly mix of purple and orange.

“The spillover effect is getting stronger. The dreams have mixed with each other. If the effect is strong enough, we could experience dreams within dreams. There’s no telling when we will get out” he added.

“Okay, this is really freaking me out” I said to them. No one replied. We stood there for a while before another door opened. Behind the door was a tunnel. The tunnel was made up of endless doors. I rushed into it, hoping to escape this dream.

I stepped out of the tunnel into a brick floor. I was once again near a water fountain, spouting purple water. It was nighttime. I looked up. There were countless brick floor platforms with water fountains above me in all sorts of directions. I walked behind one fountain and ended up on another platform perpendicular to the one I was at. I stepped back, parts of my body appeared on one platform and the remaining on another. I stepped through fountains after fountains, ending up at platform after platform, until I heard something. I looked up. No, the sound was to my left. I looked up, to my left. Someone was beating someone. I moved through the platforms until I got to a parallel platform. It was Steven. He was a mountain of meat, wearing jeans with a belt and a checkered shirt. He was beating on his dad. They both looked like Paul Bunyan. I hopped platform to get closer to them. No, it wasn’t his dad he was beating on. It was Professor Wilkin. I stopped Steven’s hand. He was crying.

“It’s okay” I told him.

I looked at Professor Wilkin. “Where are we now?” I asked him. “Where there is no music,” he replied and his face turned into a tunnel. The tunnel was made up of endless doors. I was sucked in. I flew through the endless doors and ended up at the lab. Tied to the machine.

“Thank God! You guys gotta get me the hell out of this thing now!” I screamed at the lab assistants. But they had no face. Or rather, they had faces but no features, no eyes, no nose, no mouth and no brows.

They said in unison “Once more unto the breach, dear friend” and my head swirled.

“No no no” I roared before I was plunged into another dream.

I was looking at a mermaid. The mermaid looked up and she was Katherine. No, she was Hector, then Steven, then Professor Wilkin now. She dragged me into the ground. I sank through the ground into a purple and orange landscape. No, it was drab grey now. All surrounding me were rows of people. One row was an infinite number of Katherines. Another was an infinite number of Hectors. Then endless rows of Stevens and Professors Wilkin. They all screamed at me. “Once more unto the breach, dear friend.” They were mountains of meat, wearing jeans with belts and checkered shirts, Paul Bunyans. They took out the belts and the world melted away.

I was on a precipice. Beneath me were jagged stone edges, at the tip of them were mermaids. But in the bottom were a blurry mix of swirling colors and faces. Hovering in the air was a door. Before I knew what I was doing, I was doing a running jump. I sprang with all the force I had left, screaming. One of my hands reached the lower door frame and I caught on. I slowly crawled up and got in the door. Suddenly, everything was dark.

I woke up screaming. I was in the real world. The lab assistants rushed to remove the machine from my head.

“Are you okay? Your brainwaves just spiked for a minute there,” one of them told me. I said I wasn’t sure this was real. I pinched myself and it hurt. I looked at my friends and Professor Wilkin. They were still hooked up to the machine. The lab assistant caught my look and told me that their brain waves were still too high, if they disconnected the device that would cause a sudden change and they may not be able to adjust to reality.

I went outside for fresh air.

The others woke up soon after. They all did so screaming. The lab made us sign a non-disclosure agreement. But I couldn’t do it. I had to tell you, other someone was foolish enough to take part in that experiment again. I wouldn’t do it again. Not for a million bucks. Consider this my warning, stay away from it.

There were times when I sit alone and my head would swirl, and my vision would flicker. I pinched myself and my heart jumped whenever the sensation felt distant. Sometimes, I heard the familiar saying rang out in my ears “Once more unto the breach, dear friend.”
