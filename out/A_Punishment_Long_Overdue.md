They shoved me roughly onto the table, hair getting matted in fists and the soft fat of young, still child skin getting handled. My head slammed against the table and I howled, hands roughly pinning me against the burning cold metal table until metal restraints closed and locked around my arms and ankles. My legs were spread wide open, the hot air of the room feeling as though it were boiling my naked skin, vagina exposed to the audience in the room. My hands, too, were held above my head, unable to move.

Humiliation burned at my face. I was entirely naked, my youthful body exposed to the onlookers. The leering faces of my mother, my father, my older sister and my younger brother loomed over me. Malice and disgust lingered on each of their expressions, disgust at me. Disgust at my body, disgust at my actions, disgust at my promiscuity.

Tears bubbled over my cheeks and I begged them to let me go, to tell me where I was. My head snapped around the room, unable to recognise where I was. The room was a sort of sickly grey-brown and made of wooden panels, chipped and dirty, much like the singular yellow, flickering fluorescent light that hung from the ceiling, a few flies buzzing around it. Built into the wall was a blacksmithing forge, and next to it a tray of various tools and what seemed to be piercings.

A large, overshadowing man stepped into my line of sight, his body covered by a black leather boiler suit and his head hidden by a welding helmet. The only part of him I could see were his eyes through the glass, but they were deeply unsettling. Unblinking and inhumanly wide. He motioned to my mother and father and they moved.

Two sets of hands roughly grabbed the folds of my labia majora, stretching the skin backwards until I was painfully exposed. Humiliation made me thrash, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t seem to move due to the restraints. My head snapped up to look at the blacksmith and I screamed as red hot metal pressed against my clit.

It burned so hot it felt cold. Screams turned to screeches as he pressed harder, the smell of burning and bubbling flesh filled the small room. He changed the angle at which he was pressing the needle, creating an “X” shape on my clit. I begged, howling, for him to stop, for my family to help me. The needle penetrated my clit horizontally, slow and dragging. A piercing. The blacksmith jiggled the needle and I threw my head back, screaming more. The needle was extracted but instead replaced with a thick, heavy ring piercing, also red hot. It seemed to sear my skin from the inside out.

When I turned to beg my mother for her to make it stop, begging like a child inconsolable over a skinned knee, her face contorted into rage. Leaning down, she hissed into my face. *“Maybe that will teach you, you fucking dirty whore. You’ll never want to be touched ever again. Never. It’ll hurt if you even fucking think about it, you whore.”*

The faces of the people around me began to twist, to deform. The heat of the room intensified and their skin began to dry, dehydrating and shrinking into their bones, crackling and turning black. Hair fried and eyelids rolled back until their eyes were wide, too wide, as though they were scared to miss any of my torture. Lips peeled back and teeth yellowed, some falling to the floor with an ore clang. Their faces crackled and crinkled from the wide sneering grins, tearing the sides of their mouths. It was a transformation that terrified and disgusted me to my very core, seeing their decomposing, dehydrated bodies laugh and sneer and grin at me. Even as I turned my tortured attention back to the blacksmith, I couldn’t ignore them. Their sharp, blackened fingertips with nails that seemed to snap off holding my throbbing vagina, prodding at the new piercing. Their burned flesh fell off in huge chunks like charred tree bark, flaming onto my sweaty, heaving flesh.

The blacksmith had turned his back to me, to the furnace. My thighs shook with agony and fear and every possible thing I could feel at that moment. When he turned back to me, he brought the tray with him and in his hand he held a pair of burning pliers. All of his tools and piercings seemed to be eternally glowing red from heat.

My begs turned into incoherent babbling and screams as he neared between my legs with his pliers, inserting them into me. My eyes rolled back as the electric, constant pain flooded my system. It didn’t stop. It didn’t get better. It scorched my sensitive insides, melting them closed. The pliers were jiggled around roughly, making me thrash to no avail, before being removed.

My eyes opened to the realisation that the room was more populated than it had been before. More of those crispy, shrivelled beings seemed to infect the room, the smell making me choke. Hands tugged at the clit piercing and I begged them to leave me alone, but to no avail. I wasn’t even aware of my own talking anymore. I was just hoping I’d black out soon from the pain.

The pliers were ran down the skin of my lanai minora, melting the fragile skin before they were pushed together to fuse, the only gaps allowing me to be able to urinate. New piercings were being made with the needle, around ten through the labia majora. One after the other, rings were inserted into the piercings, effectively sealing me closed. The burn was all I could focus on. My eyes wouldn’t open and I howled and screamed and screeched with every breath. Blood streamed down my wrists from my nails digging into my palm.

The hands of the dehydrated, burned corpses touched me. Yanking at piercings, sticking through the gaps to poke at the melted inner labia, twisting skin, pinching nipples. Anything to cause pain. Burning pliers pressed repeatedly against my sensitive thighs, my skin sizzling audibly. 

The pain was just too much, too much. Too much. Screams began to die off as my eyes rolled back and it faded into nothing, finally some respite from the onslaught. But who knows what tomorrow will bring.
