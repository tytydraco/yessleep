I was raised in a backwoods town by a young single mother, the only friend I had for much of my childhood. She'd had me in her early teens, raising me entirely without help in the house her estranged parents had left behind when they skipped town, and with it any responsibility to their daughter.

"I don't need them," Mama always said. "All I ever wanted was you. I asked for a son and you came to me. Isn't that a beautiful thing?"

The neighbors thought my father to be some teenage boy my mother had gone with, or a husband that had strayed from his family, and had abandoned my Mama as soon as I was born.

We let them think so. As soon as I was old enough to understand things my mother had taken me to visit my father in the forest, warning me never to go there on my own.

“You could fall and end up hurt,” Mama said. “Or likely pester your daddy with questions or favors of some kind. You leave him in peace.”

Only she could be trusted to speak to my father, which she did as gently as any lover, kneeling down in the dirt by him, her hands knotted in the grass.

My father, you see, was a pit in the earth six feet long and wide, a well bucket hung on a length of rope over it, though there was no structure of any kind to suggest that hole had ever been used to draw water from. How deep it was I didn’t know, for I’d never seen the bottom of the well even on the brightest day, nor heard any of the stray stones or spilled earth that happened to fall into it reach its end.

My Mama told me she’d found my father in the woods as a young girl and had fallen for him from their first meeting, the strangeness of which I’d never dared question. They’d spent days and nights talking with each other, and though I’d never heard that hole speak in my presence I always had the feeling it, or he, was listening to us, that it looked on at where we stood over it.

In conversation with him my mother learned that if she placed something my father wanted in the well bucket and lowered it down the shaft what came back up would be something different, something she had asked for in return. In that way she made requests for all kinds of things— food, mostly, in the beginning, then other necessities, though never of such worth she’d up and leave town with them.

She loved my father with all her heart and swore she’d never leave his side.

One day Mama asked the hole to give her a son, though what she offered in exchange she’d never say. For almost an hour she sat waiting to pull the bucket back up, then from the bottom of the well she'd heard a baby cry and yanked on the rope till she had me in her arms.

“If my daddy’s a pit in the dirt,” I said once, “then what does that make me?”

“That’s not what he is,” my mother snapped at me. “And besides, you’re my boy, that’s all. I don’t want to hear you talk like that again, you hear?”

I understood from the murmurings I’d heard around town that there were a lot of things in that part of the country you weren’t to speak of out loud, or if you did only in some sideways fashion to avoid bad luck of some kind. Being that I’d never made any friends my exposure to other kinds of thinking was little to none; I didn’t question the life I was living, or where I’d come from for the longest time.

When I’d watch my Mama conversing with the hole, or loading up that bucket with dead magpies in return for coins, I was only grateful I had a father that provided for us and expected so little in return.
 
This couldn’t last, of course, not when I got old enough to see my life for what it was and acknowledge that it was not right.

I was eleven years old when it first occurred to me that I should fear my father, though the notion did not come to me of my own merit. Our furthest neighbors, the Guillot family, had started showing an interest in me around that time, staring whenever I went by the house or making passing comments where before they'd kept their distance.

"They're cousins of ours," Mama said when I asked her about them. "We don't have nothing to do with them folks. You leave them be."

By then I'd learned that whenever my mother warned me away from something it meant that there was some secret behind it I wanted to know. So when, one day, Eddy Guillot came out of his front yard to talk to me I lingered, curious about the man my Mama had nothing but harsh words for.

"You take care of yourself out there in them woods," said Eddy, jerking his head in the direction of the trees. "I've seen Beatrice taking you out there with her. She ought to know it ain't safe."

I thought of the disquiet I felt around the pit, and the guilt that came afterwards from not loving my father the way Mama did.

Eddy squinted at me, his tanned face lined with concern.

"You know what I'm talking about, don't you, Bertie?"

I shrugged. Mama had always told me to keep my mouth shut about my father if people came asking, and though she'd never so much as raised a hand to me I was afraid of crossing her. All she'd have to do is give me a certain look and I'd hush up or quit whatever it was that I was doing right away. 

Looking back I suppose I had a fear she'd put me in the well bucket and ask my father to take me away again. She'd threatened to, after all, from time to time when I’d acted up. 

Eddy leant down over his fence, the wood creaking under his hands.

"Look," he said. "If you ever want to get out of this place just say the word and I'll drive you out to the city. We got family over there that'd take you in and won't mind where you came from."

"Mama don't want to move away," I said. "She says she don't want to leave the forest behind."

There was a sadness in Eddy's eyes, then, and something fearful, too.

"I ain't taking your Mama nowhere,” he said. “Figure she ain't told you why our family don't talk no more."

"No, sir," I said.

I hoped Eddy would tell me, filling in one of the many holes Mama had purposefully cut out of her history, but he only turned and spat into a patch of wildflowers.

"You ask her, sometime," he said. "Maybe she'll tell you the truth if you keep at her enough. She takes you out to that place, after all. You know what she's been fooling with."

I didn't reply, only looked down to watch a spider crawling over a rock.

"We all knew not to go out there when we was all kids together," said Eddy. "All the old folks told us stories about the goings on there used to be back before people knew better. But then some are just stupid and don't see no problem with what they do."

Suddenly I couldn't resist my curiosity.

"You're talking about the pit," I said, and Eddy nodded.

"That's right. The Well Man, only there's no man down there. That's just all we knew to call it by."

By the matter-of-fact logic of a child I figured that it if there wasn’t any kind of man in that hole then surely it couldn't be my father, but I believed what my Mama had told me, had seen things brought up out of the black with my own eyes.

"What’s in the well?" I asked. "Magic?"

"No," said Eddy. "Not the good kind, anyway. Some folks call your mama a witch for dealing with that thing, but she's just a slave. Without her going to it the Well Man—or Well King—can't get what it wants. It just sits, sleeping in the dirt, till somebody makes their way over there again. So it made Beatrice keep coming over. Told her just what she wanted to hear so she didn’t know how it was playing her."

I didn't like having the trees at my back, then, nor the pit, which though miles into that wood seemed closer now, as though it had heard its name and was eavesdropping on the two of us.

"There’s something down there in that hole," I said. "I hear it moving, sometimes. But I never saw it or nothing."

"Hardly anybody does," said Eddy darkly. "Not unless they go down that well, and if they do they ain't coming out, least not as they were. So don't you think of doing it, not even if your Mama's with you."

"I won't," I said.

I meant it. I'd started to wonder what my mother did by that pit when I wasn't with her, and now I got to thinking about what had been sent down and brought up out of it in the past that had Eddy so afraid.

"If it's not a man in there," I said, "what is it?"

But Eddy had caught sight of my mother coming out of our front door and backed off across the yard and up onto the stoop out of sight.

"You get along now," he said. "You just remember what I said, alright? I don't want to see you get yourself hurt."

I wandered over to my mother’s house before she saw me lingering by the Guillot property and got wind that I'd broken one of her rules. She was stood waiting for me, swaying the way she always did when she was worked up about something.

"Now just where the hell have you been?" she asked. "I thought I told you to stay home today."

"I got bored," I said honestly enough. "Sorry, Mama."

She relaxed, but only slightly, fussing over me as though I'd been gone for days.

"Don't do it again. I thought—"

Here my mother glanced off out of the window at the woods, catching herself a second too late.

"Well, I thought you'd run off on me, that's all," she said. "You come on inside, now."

I did as she told me, but all the rest of that day into the night I thought about my father, wondered if my Mama had truly chosen to love him or if, like Eddy said, he'd made her feel that way, somehow.

I still cared for my mother, felt sick at the thought of anything bad ever happening to her, or ever having to leave her. But speaking to Eddy had opened my eyes in a way they’d never quite shut again, and I was drawn to him and the knowledge he had to give.

I had to wait till Mama was sick with one of her headaches to see him a second time. Eddy’s wife had just had a baby girl not long since, and when I passed their yard I saw Eddy holding her, pointing to a bird that had landed on a fencepost. It flew off when I got near, and Eddy looked over at me, his smile falling.

“Your Mama ain’t been letting you out of the house much lately,” he commented. “I’ve been looking out for you. How you been holding up?”

“Fine,” I said.

Eddy nodded.

“You ain’t been fooling around by that well any?”

“I know the way there,” I said. “But I ain’t ever been without Mama with me.”

I saw Eddy’s shoulders ease slightly.

“That’s good. And it ain’t ever let you see it, what’s down there?”

“Not even once.”

At this Eddy seemed to make some kind of decision.

“Hold on a minute.”

He took the baby inside the house and came out with a glass of orange juice which he held out to me.

“Rose made a jug fresh,” he said as I took it and drank. “Don’t tell your Mama I gave you any.”

I gave Eddy a look.

“You don’t like her, do you?”

“I did when we was all growing up together,” said Eddy. “Then she turned strange. Started thinking she was hearing a man calling to her out in them woods. I heard her telling her Ma about it. ‘Sometimes it sounds like there’s more than one man out there,’ she said. ‘All calling my name.’ ‘Don’t you go near,’ Aunt Jeanette told her. ‘No matter what you hear, or what he tells you’.

But Beatrice wouldn’t listen. She went on out there and met with the well. Started dealing with it. Brought it all kinds of things, only it was her it really wanted. The Well King— they say it does something to them that serve it. Brings something dark out in them. Makes them do worse and worse things until one day they go down that pit themselves to be with it and don’t come back.”

I imagined my mother sitting in the well bucket, smiling as she lowered herself down into the shaft, and felt a cold break out across me.

“Mama says he loves her,” I said, and Eddy snorted.

“That thing down there ain’t ever loved in its life.”

“You ever seen him?”

“No, and I’m glad I ain’t. But I had an uncle that did. He said it was just like the stories. Scared him so bad he never went back. Your Mama, though. If she seen it and stayed she ain’t never gonna leave. She’ll go down that pit and take you in with her.”

“She wouldn’t,” I said, without much certainty.

Eddy sighed and sat down in a deckchair he had out in the yard.

“Back when she started seeing the Well King her Ma and Pa were fixing to cover it over or close it up somehow, whatever they could to keep it from getting to anybody. Figured maybe it’d die off if they did. They followed Beatrice out into the woods, and that was the last anybody saw of them.”

My mouth opened, but I couldn’t ask the question on my tongue. Eddy answered it anyway.

“How she got them down that pit I don’t know. Pushed them, maybe, or killed them somehow and lowered them down after. All I know is when she came back she had two mutt dogs with her, both of them vicious and crazy as anything.

They’d bite folks, fight each other and neighbor’s animals at all hours of the night. Wound up both getting shot by somebody, and we all figured it was a mercy. The things that Well King makes. Most of the time there’s something wrong with them, or maybe it’s they remember what they were and it drives them mad.”

Alarmed, I asked, “What about people? You ever hear about the pit making a person and them being alright? Or are they bad, too?”

A strangeness passed over Eddy’s expression.

“I ain’t heard enough about it to say. Lot of babies born over the years without a mother or father, a lot of them strange. Some of them turn to doing things you’re too young to hear of. Ain’t no way of knowing why they went that way, or if the pit had anything to do with it.”

My stomach turned with the same cold that was all around me. 

“What is he?” I asked.

Eddy shrugged.

“They say you can see it for yourself if you ask it right. Take it some sort of gift, and it won’t be so dark down there. It’ll let you look.”

I understood from this that Eddy did not wish to tell me, for what reason I did not know.

“If he’s got magic why does he stay down there in the well all the time?” I asked. 

“Been down there so long in the dirt and the dark it don’t want to be no place else,” said Eddy. “Folks say it was born down there, ended up fused with the walls so it couldn’t climb itself out. And then—”

He paused, searching for the right words.

“It got all twisted up in its mind, too, so that it ended up with powers of some kind. Powers it used to bring people to it and play with them. That’s all its ever known. You ought to go see it yourself so you know I’m telling you the truth. Then you come by and see me again.”

Before I could say anything more Eddy stood up, folding his chair in two. 

“I got to see to Marie. Rose has been rushed off her feet since she was born. I got to do my bit, now don’t I?”

I was jealous, suddenly, wishing I had a father like Eddy, not the hole in the earth I’d grown up with instead. But I only went away, saying nothing of this, only thinking Marie was lucky without her even knowing it yet.



Again I was slow to make any kind of move towards the well, half frozen with the guilt of everything I'd been doing behind Mama's back and half afraid of what I was to find about myself and the pit.

What stirred me to act in the end was my mother and what I caught her at one afternoon when she thought I was playing in the house, out of her way.

As it was I'd seen her from the window, walking out to the woods with a bundle in her arms I guessed was rags until a white arm stuck out of the end of it.

Seeing it I remembered something she'd said that morning—"How about we get a pig? A cute little pig we could raise, and then we can eat it right up when it gets too big to keep."

I ran out to the treeline after my mother, then, faster than I’d run all my life.

"Mama," I said. "What are you doing with Marie?"

She jumped when she heard me, but her eyes were empty, no shame there in having been caught, no fear that I'd tell.

"She was in the yard," was all Mama said.

"So you just took her?" I asked in amazement. "You gotta give her back. Please, Mama."

For a minute I thought she'd ignore me and keep on walking into those woods, but she must have figured I'd follow her as in the end she strode back to the Guillot house and put the baby back in her stroller where it stood in the yard. Seeing her Eddy and his wife started yelling and cursing, anger in their voices like I'd never heard before or since.

Mama just stood there, her face still blank, taking every harsh word they had for her without saying a single one in return.

Eddy glanced over at me, and I accepted that what he'd said was true. My mother wasn't right in the head, and was only getting worse as time went by. She didn't care what anyone thought of her, only for herself and the pit she'd married. Even I couldn't reach her anymore. 

Still I tried.

"You got to stop going out there, Mama," I said. "Daddy ain't good, like you think. If he was he wouldn't ask you to give him that baby."

"He gave me you," she said quietly. "Who am I to argue with what he wants?"

I let her go, after that, so disturbed that all I could do was watch as she slid away between the trees.


I knew then that I had no choice but to do as Eddy had told me and try to learn from the Well King what he was, and who I was in turn. I couldn’t have left town not knowing, and though the pit had never talked to me I’d learned from my mother what things were considered high value to trade.

There were chickens in our yard she kept to feed us; I caught three of them and put them in a box with holes in it, thinking my father would be more agreeable to answering my questions if I kept him fed.

“The stomach’s the way to a man’s heart,” Mama said once. “Your daddy’s no different in that way.”

Being that flashlights and lamps my Mama had taken to the well on gloomy days had never touched it I didn’t bother bringing either. The dark was part of my father, and I had some idea he’d move it apart so that I could see inside.

The walk out to the pit was hard, my arms wrapped tight around the box slowing me down. The noise the chickens made seemed so loud in the quiet of the wood I was sure the Well King must have known that I was coming, waiting for me out there in the earth with the patience only something old and strong can know.

When I got to him I felt the usual grim presence surrounding the pit tugging at me like a chain. I was careful putting the squirming chickens in the well bucket, which was bigger than any used to pull water up, being nearly as wide as the hole itself.

I kept thinking I'd lose my balance and pitch down over the edge, clinging to the frame the bucket hung from with a hysterical grip.

"I brought you something to eat," I said to the pit as bravely as I could manage. "Can you show me what my Mama gave you to make me with? She won't say. I hope the birds are enough. I don't have anything else."

As usual the well didn't answer me, but I began to lower the bucket anyway, watching the chickens flap their wings against the side of it with a squeeze of guilt. Soon the dark took them in, and I felt the give of something pulling at the bucket, heard the squawk of the birds as it grabbed on.

Feathers fluttered up from the well shaft, some of them stained at the tips with blood.

My mouth was rancid with bile, and still I stood bravely drawing the rope back up, sensing a new weight on the end of the line. As I tugged hard on it daylight touched the bucket, and I saw that it had been filled up with rodent skeletons, their tiny skulls ending in curved white teeth that flashed in the sun.

I sat down hard by the pit, feeling dirt and grass come loose under my fingernails as I scrambled back from the edge. Tears fell down my face, provoked by shock and revulsion and bewilderment. 

"What am I?" I asked. "What are you?"

At last a voice came up from the bottom of the shaft, more like the primal shrieks of some wilderness animal than anything human.

"YOU ARE MY SON," it said. "AND I—"

As I watched the black of the well dissipated before my eyes like something in a dream, only I'd never dreamed anything like what I saw down there, not even when I woke myself up screaming, sometimes.

Pressed tight to the walls of the pit were hundreds of rats, some so small that their bodies were crushed and deformed by the weight of their brothers against them, others nearly as big as dogs, raising their heads to look at me with crazed, but intelligent eyes.

At the heart of the well all their tails were knotted up together in a pink ball of flesh that throbbed like a beating heart, and beneath them lay what was left both of people and animals, all eaten down to their bones.

What living creatures had been sent back up in the bucket in place of those things had their broken souls in them and nothing more, for nothing more was left. The Well King—Rat King—watched me with its many heads, and I stumbled further back from the hole, aware that I remembered being rats too, once, deep inside me.

And like a rat I ran.

I went straight over to Eddy's house, soaked so badly with sweat that it looked like I'd been caught in the rain, and so exhausted from how fast I'd gone through the woods that I had no air left to speak with. Eddy came out to meet me like he'd been expecting me to call and put a hand on my shoulder.

"You saw it," he said simply.

I nodded. He didn't ask anything more, only walked me round to his truck and opened the door for me to get in.

As he pulled out onto the road I saw my mother standing by, watching us go without trying to intervene. She looked beaten down by defeat, the lost little girl she must have been all those years ago when she'd traded for me.

What became of her after I left that day I never tried to learn, not wanting to know whether the townsfolk had taken things into their own hands and killed her like her dogs or if, like the other servants of the well, she'd gone down to the Rat King to be with what she loved even in death.

I'm fortunate I never felt her need to serve, that learning what I was disgusted me rather than making me feel any kinship with that creature. The rest of my childhood was spent living with an uncle I had in the city, a good man that, like Eddy had promised, didn't poke around into my past, only accepted me as I was and even taught me a trade. He made me the man I am, one as good as he is, I hope.

But as hard as I work, and as clean as I try to live I've never been able to shake the crawling, dirty feeling of meeting my father, or of learning what I was built from. I keep waiting for something to rot inside me like it did the other creatures the Rat King made, but it's been twenty years since I saw his many faces.

If he’s in me still he works slow.
