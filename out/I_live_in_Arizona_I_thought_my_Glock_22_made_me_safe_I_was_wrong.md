I’m writing this because I can’t sleep and my hands are still shaking. I live in a rural part of Arizona, Maricopa County. For those who don't know, we have Constitutional Carry here. No permit needed, no questions asked. I’ve always been a "good guy with a gun" type. I own a Glock 22 (.40 S&W) and I’ve spent enough hours at the range to feel confident.

Last night, that confidence died.

At exactly 2:10 AM, the floodlight in my backyard snapped on. I know the time because I have a digital clock right next to my bed that glows neon blue. My bedroom window faces the rear of the property. I sat up, reaching for the Glock before I was even fully awake.

The way my house is set up, I have motion sensors on the corners. If someone walks from the front toward the back along the side of the house, the lights trigger in sequence. First the side, then the backyard. Both were blindingly bright.

I thought it was a tweaker or a burglar. I crept to the side window, but the gravel path was empty. Then I ran to the front of the house and looked out toward the street.

Standing under the yellow hum of the streetlamp was... something. It was at least 8 feet tall. It was impossibly thin, like a stick figure made of shadow. It was wearing something that looked like a black tactical suit, but it was too tight, like a second skin.

It didn't have a face. Just a void. And it was waving at me. Not a friendly wave, but a slow, mechanical tilt of its arm, back and forth.

I lost it. I started yelling, trying to scare it off. I ran back, grabbed the collar of my Doberman, Brutus, and kicked the back door open. The thing had already moved—it was sprinting around the other side of my house with a weird, jerky gait. Brutus didn't even hesitate; he launched himself into the dark.

Behind my property is about 650 feet of desert scrub and dead brush leading down to the river. Right in the middle of that wasteland is an abandoned farmhouse, a ruin from the early 1900s.

I chased them. I was in my boxers, barefoot, stepping on thorns and sharp rocks, but the adrenaline was too high to feel it. I saw Brutus disappear into the tall grass near the old house. I stopped about 60 feet out when I realized I couldn't hear his bark anymore.

The tall thing was just standing there by the riverbank. It didn't look like it was breathing. I didn't wait for it to move. I leveled the Glock and fired three rounds.

Bang. Bang. Bang.

I’m a good shot. I saw the shadow flinch. Then it just... melted into the darkness of the mesquite trees.

Ten minutes later, two patrol cars from the Sheriff’s office pulled up. In our area, we have ShotSpotter technology—acoustic sensors that pick up gunfire and alert dispatch immediately. They didn't even wait for a 911 call.

The deputies were cool at first, probably thinking it was just another guy shooting at coyotes. But then they went out into the brush with their high-powered flashlights.

They found my brass. Then, they found the bullets.

All three of them were lying in a neat row on a patch of flattened grass. They were perfectly mushroomed. For those who don't know ballistics, that’s what a hollow-point bullet does when it hits high-density organic tissue. It expands to do maximum damage.

My bullets had hit something. They had expanded inside flesh.

But there was no blood. No trail. No body. The forensics guy looked sick. He told me those bullets didn't fall there. They looked like they had been manually pulled out of a wound and placed on the ground as a "thank you."

The deputies didn't even cite me for discharging a firearm in a residential zone. They just told me to go inside, lock my doors, and "maybe buy a shotgun."

I’m looking out my window now. Brutus hasn't stopped whining since we got back. He’s staring at the backyard. And the motion sensor just went off again.
