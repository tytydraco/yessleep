I’m Raghad. We recently moved back to my father’s hometown to settle down with his family. I was genuinely excited for a fresh start, a new school, and new friends. But the moment my teacher announced my name to the class, the atmosphere shifted.

The girls didn’t just look at me; they looked through me, their eyes filled with a deep, silent fear. It was as if my name was a forbidden word they hadn't heard in years. I sat down, feeling like an outsider in a room full of secrets. Only one girl was brave enough to talk to me, which made me feel a bit safer, but even during recess, I could feel dozens of eyes tracking my every move. My heart couldn't find peace.

During our activity period, a girl approached me. She pulled me to a quiet corner and whispered words that made my blood run cold:

"Do you want to know why they are all avoiding you? Eleven years ago, there was another girl here named Raghad. Her life ended right here in a tragedy so dark, no one dares to speak of it. They say she never truly left... that she still wanders these halls at night. Everyone has seen her."

I stood there, frozen. I went back to my friend, my face pale as a ghost. She asked if I was okay, but I couldn't find the words to explain. I tried to ignore it, but the feeling of being watched only grew.

By the last period on Thursday, a teacher—who always seemed to look at me with unexplained resentment—sent me to the old storage room to fetch some supplies. The room was dark and cramped. As I climbed a box to reach a high shelf, the entire unit gave way. Everything went black.

When I finally woke up, my body was aching. I struggled to my feet and pushed the heavy door open, only to be met with a terrifying reality. The school was deserted. It was 8:00 PM. The halls were swallowed by an intense, suffocating darkness.

The girl’s warning echoed in my mind: Raghad comes out at night.

I was terrified. Why hadn't my family come looking for me? The school was far from home, but surely they noticed I was missing? I started to cry, praying for a way out. I ran to the principal's office and miraculously found a key left in the teachers' room. Inside the office, I searched frantically until I found an old mobile phone in a box. It only had 7% battery.

I called the police, and thankfully, they picked up. Even they were confused about why no one had reported me missing. While I waited for them to arrive, just as I was about to step toward the exit, I saw something that shattered my mind.

In the flicking shadows of the corridor, a figure appeared for a split second before vanishing. It was a dark silhouette, a head with no features... no eyes, no mouth, just a void. It was the exact shape they had described to me. It was her.

I am safe now, but I can't stop thinking about it. Did that teacher intentionally leave me there? And how could my own family completely forget I existed for those hours? I feel like the nightmare hasn't truly ended.
