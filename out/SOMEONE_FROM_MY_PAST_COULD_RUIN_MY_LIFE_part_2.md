Hi...

I have an update. a really weird one. 

If you didn't read my first post, here's all the background on what's going on...

[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13vdgwn/someone\_from\_my\_past\_could\_ruin\_my\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13vdgwn/someone_from_my_past_could_ruin_my_life/)

Basically, there's someone in my past who knows too much about me. Like, she knows everything. Really damaging shit that could fuck up my whole life.This is someone who I very intentionally left in the past. This person has re-emerged and wants my help with something. I'm not sure what. At least, not yet. 

I was planning on meeting this person, Melissa, later this week...But things have gotten really weird.

So… I looked into it.

I started looking, found no social media. No insta, no facebook, no twitter. I guess we were in college before that stuff really took off but I’m surprised Melissa isn’t anywhere online. Not even LinkedIn.

I started to google “Melissa…” but then realized without her last name it’d be tough. So I started trying combinations. “Melissa (university name)” “Melissa (university name) 2011” 

What was her major again? I couldn’t recall. I guess I didn’t really know or remember most of my friend’s majors, but still. I was a little on edge. Had she even had a major? I mean, was she even enrolled at the school? Or was she just some grifter who’d come on campus posing as a student? I’d never seen her dorm… no, that’s a lie. I had. I’d seen it. But only the outside, we’d suntan out front of the residential hall she lived in. So maybe it wasn’t her dorm. Maybe she just said it was.

Okay. Sorry. I’ll stop. I get like this sometimes. Paranoid. I went through a lot of trauma as a kid and without getting into too many details, the kind of trauma I dealt with is the kind that tends to fuck with your memory/ability to self soothe/ability to be discerning/all sorts of shit. So I’ll spin in circles about stuff I can’t quite recall all the details, worried I did something bad or wrong or said something mean, you name it. 

But anyways.I was typing Melissa’s name into the search engine with every combination I could think of, to no avail. Then I thought of one that might yield a result. “Melissa Car Accident” nothing. “Melissa Car Accident Injury” “Melissa Car Accident Law Suit” then...

I remembered one of the handful of times *she’d* opened up to *me*, when she talked about how much she loved her hometown. Well, suburb, more like it. I typed in: “Melissa Agoura Hills Car Accident”, along with a few other words I won’t retype here for discretion/to preserve my/her identity, but basically a few other key details she’d told me about the accident. A description of the location. The car make and model. What the accident scene looked like. The one time she opened up to me about the accident, she’d talked for hours and actually cried. From what I gleaned, it seems like her whole family may have died in it (not 100% sure though, she spoke about it vaguely and she was so emotional that I felt I couldn’t ask questions or pry).

So. I typed in the key words. But before I could hit enter, google auto-filled the next word: *death*.

Melissa Agoura Hills Car Accident *Death*.

Look. I’m open to the idea that the supernatural could exist. Sure. Why not. I can’t prove it doesn’t. And if I can’t even rule out events that may have occurred in my own memory, with certainty, how could I possibly rule out the supernatural with any degree of certainty? (If you’re getting the vibe that I’m not someone who has a whole lot of certainty in their life/mental headspace you’d be right).

So, extremely creeped out, I hit enter.

An archived article came up after a bit of scrolling. (Omitting some of the headline to protect identities): “Crash kills Lindero Canyon student, rest of family in critical condition.” I pulled it up.

The victim was 12-year-old Melissa Gomez.

The thing is, Melissa Gomez died at 12-years-old in 1990, when the article was written. And she was Hispanic. While the details matched up pretty exactly to what Melissa had told me about her accident… The Melissa I knew was a white blonde girl. She's my age… 34. The Melissa Gomez killed in the accident would’ve been like 46 today.

So now I’m thinking maybe Melissa – my Melissa – wasn’t in the accident at all? Maybe she just ripped off the story, and took it as her own, to make me feel bad for her and manipulate me? I’m really not sure what to think. Or what she wants to talk about Thursday. But I'm scared.

The thing I can't really wrap my head around is, when Melissa talked about the accident all those years ago, her language was so vivid. Like she could close her eyes and see it all playing out again and again, like she was tortured by it. Maybe she’s just a really good liar.

I don’t know what to do now. I want to cancel but Melissa has been continuously pestering me on text. More than that. She’s been asking about (my best friend) and wants to know if we’re still close, if I still feel the same way about her I did all those years ago (when I'd revealed some very dark things about our friendship to Melissa). I get the feeling if I try to cancel on Melissa, my best friend will be the first person she goes to, she’ll start there and continue cutting a path through my closest friends and family, not stopping until she’s burnt it all to the ground.

There’s one other thing I can’t put together. What could she possibly want from me?

ISO: advice. Thanks for all your advice on the last thread. I just can't bring myself to come clean to my fiancé or best friend. It's just too bad. I didn't mention everything I did/said with/to Melissa on the last post, mostly out of shame, but suffice to say, the things I did and said during the time of my life were really fucked up.

Thanks again.
