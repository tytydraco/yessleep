So when i was a young boy of 5 to 6 years of age. I woke up in the middle of the night when i heard crying in my room. I was a brave kid so I didn't think much of it when I saw a boy crying in the corner of my room. I got up from my bed and walked over to the boy. The room was hot and I was sweating a lot. When I got to the boy I notice he was in a robe curled up in a corner. 

"Um are you okay." I said as I touched his shoulder.

Suddenly the boy's cry changed to a sigh. Suddenly the boy stood taller then I could imagine. Maybe 8 foot in height if I had to guess. When it turned all I saw was a skull with two eyes.

 Red eyes

I felt nothing but fear. I screamed for my father but there was no answer. Just a twisted smile as a boney finger placed on its skull teeth. 

"You're not supposed to be here." It said in a voice far from human. Far from anything that can be descided. "You need to leave now."

It pointed a long boney finger towards me. Fire shot threw my windows and the heat in the room grew ten fold. I ran towards my bed then suddenly I tripped over a toy in my room. I got up just as it stood over me and jumped onto my bed. I pulled the cover over my head and began to cry.

"You must leave this place for it is not your time." The two eyed skull of fire said. "I will give you a gift. a gift like no other of my kind has given. You will know the true concept of time."

Suddenly I felt a finger touch my head. It burned and I screamed. After it stopped I threw the cover off. Though it wasn't night. It was morning. I got up and ran in the living room and saw the clock read some time around 8am. My dad looked at me with confusion. 

"You don't usually get up early unless its a school day." He said "what's wrong?"

"I had a really bad nightmare dad. It really scared me."

"Don't be a pussy. Go in your room and clean it up." He looked down at my leg. "And clean up that bloody knee."

A shiver went down my spine as I looked at my knee then turned to my room. I ran in and saw the toy I tripped over and a blood spot on the ground. I cleaned the blood of the floor and cleaned off my knee.

'Was it real?' I thought, 'Was what happened with the skull guy real?'

That's when I saw it. In the corner of my eye, just out the window, I saw a tall thin shape. I turned and saw two piercing eyes in a bare skull with a boney finger over its teeth. It smiled that same twisted smile as it waved goodbye. Suddenly it was gone. 

I'm now 20 years old and I turn 21 next year. A lot has happened but I don't have the time as of now to explain it all. It's almost 4am and I haven't slept because of something recent. Though I do have a question for who ever is reading this. It said there was more of his kind. More skulls with piercing eyes and a voice unheard by the ears of men. So my question is this. 

What are they and who else was given a 'gift' like me.
