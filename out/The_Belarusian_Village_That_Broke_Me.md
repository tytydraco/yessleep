I haven’t shared this story in a long time. Not in full detail. At first, I tried to tell people about it, but no one wanted to listen. A psychologist back in Minsk told me it was just trauma. A hallucination. Maybe it was. But certain smells — mold, burnt wood, damp earth — still make me freeze. Some sounds still make me quietly cry when no one’s around.

I’ve tried to move on, or at least act like I have. But that place… it never left me.
If you ever hear about a place called Lisoviya Haty — the Forest Huts — near the borders of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine… please, please don’t go there.

May 2015 — When I Was 17

Back then, I lived in Minsk. A noisy, gray city full of cold buildings and harder people. But I always loved escaping to the countryside — the forest, the silence. Near the border, there was a forest where my friends and I used to camp as kids. I had vague memories of an old village somewhere inside that forest. No one was sure if it was still in Belarus or had slipped into Ukraine. It was the kind of place people forget, a no-man’s land where time seemed to have stopped.

One weekend in May, I decided to go there alone.

I packed a small backpack: some clothes, food, my wallet, cigarettes — and my sketchbook. Drawing old houses and nature was the only thing that calmed me. I wanted to be alone, away from the noise and the pressure of the city.

Entering the Village

The forest grew darker the further I walked. The air thickened with dampness and an unsettling smell — like rotten earth hiding something dead beneath it. I told myself I was just imagining it.

After hours of walking on a forgotten gravel road, overgrown with weeds and moss, I saw the rooftops peek through the trees.

The houses were not ruins, but they looked far older and more rotten than time should allow.

Mold crawled over window frames, walls, and even the ground, a thick black, gray, and green web that seemed alive.

I sat by one house and started sketching, trying to calm my nerves. Then I saw something move.


---

The Creature

At first, I thought it was an animal — a dog maybe. But it was too tall, moved too silently, like it weighed nothing.

Its legs bent in unnatural ways.

I barely caught a glimpse of its face — pale, moldy skin stretched over something that wasn’t human.

I froze in place.

When I looked away for a second — it was gone.

I ran.


---

The Forgotten Bag

In my panic, I realized I’d left my backpack by one of the moldiest houses — at the foot of a rotten staircase.

My wallet, ID, money, phone charger — everything — was inside.

I should have just left it. Run and never looked back.

But something inside me forced me to go back.


---

The Second Encounter

It was getting dark, and the trees felt like jaws closing in.

I reached the house — worse than any other — walls swollen with water damage, ceiling covered in mold, stairs rotting beneath me.

I reached down and grabbed the bag.

Then I heard it.

Squash. Squash. Squash.

Footsteps in the mold.

I turned around.

It was there.

Closer than before.

The creature.

Its skin gray-green and wet-looking, its eyes black and empty.

It smelled like death mixed with damp earth.

It moved with jerky, unnatural motions, like it wasn’t bound by the laws of nature.

I ran.

Barefoot, stumbling, heart pounding.

It chased me for a moment but stopped before the tree line.


---

The Bag at Home

When I finally got home, I opened the bag.

Everything inside was covered in a thin layer of mold — not just on the surface, but deep in the fabric.

Even my cigarette pack was damp.

My sketchbook pages had warped.

The drawings inside had changed.

Faces I never drew.

One looked like the creature.

I was terrified.


---

The Mold Spread

I wanted to throw everything away.

But something stopped me.

The mold spread to my clothes.

To my room.

The kitchen table started to rot.

At first, I thought it was coincidence.

But every day it got worse.

Eventually, I took the table outside and burned it in the garden.


---

The Breakdown

I couldn’t sleep.

I heard sounds in the walls.

The smell of damp earth lingered in my room.

I was afraid of the bag.

One night, I walked to the lake near my home.

I threw the bag into the cold, dark water.

When it hit the surface, I heard a low, wet gurgle — like something alive drowning.

I stood there, frozen, watching it sink.


---

The Years After

It only got worse.

I started drinking heavily.

Smoking weed to calm my nerves.

Using amphetamines to stay awake.

I know it sounds like I lost my mind.

But something latched onto me.

My mother kicked me out after I started burning furniture and saying it was “infested.”

No one saw what I saw.

Months turned into years.

I tried to live normally.

But I always felt watched.

In mirrors.

In dark corners.


---

Now — 2025

I’m 27.

I live in Denmark.

I fled Belarus when Russia invaded Ukraine.

I’m scared.

Still broken inside.

Sometimes when I sleep…

I wake up smelling mold.

And when I turn on the light, there are damp marks on my door.

Like someone — or something — is trying to get in.

I don’t know what I brought back from that village.

But it doesn’t want me to forget.

Every time I see an old backpack, I smell mold.
