Chapter 1: Bursting the Bubble

To all listening on this broadcast, I have been to their realm. What’s happening now is their idea of sport until their invasion begins. We need to identify them and the breaches before it’s too late!

You might have noticed disappearances all over the country. Hell, they’ve been happening worldwide, but it seems to have started in Russia near someplace called Dachnyye Goryachiye Istochniki. Obviously, no one took it seriously, except the Russians after odd reports of rabid humans sprung out of nowhere. That’s around the time the first video dropped. The problem was, well, it was dark. Pitch black. But we could hear the screams. There were those unlike anything I’d ever fathomed from any animal, then there were those that were unnaturally long and loud. Apparently, a man was pleading for mercy. Now no one can contact a single town within 20 miles.

Well, it wouldn’t be long until I learned that for myself.

It started on a cold winter morning. I made two cups of coffee to force my lazy self out and into the tundra of Wisconsin. I thought Ohio had it bad in my younger days, but global warming seems to have forgotten this state. That being said, I didn’t mind it at all. I had been living in Columbus after my contract in the Navy when I decided to peace out for the second time. Now I'm a software developer working from home, except Mondays. Sadly, it was Monday. That meant a team meeting that we could one hundred percent do online, but our company and my project manager thought face-to-face interactions were healthy. I’d normally agree, but considering the lazy members who put everything off, ask others to do their work, or simply make excuses, I didn’t really have anything I wanted to say that was professional enough for a meeting. 

I hated everything. The fake friendliness, pizza or group parties, and the “we’re family here” that implies I wanted another. I should be grateful, but everything and everyone just seemed so lifeless. So fake. Everything felt like it was HR approved before it was spoken. No one could be offended or good luck when they let you go on the next set of lay-offs. 

When I headed out the door, it was still fairly dark and snowing. With my coffee in one hand and my laptop bag over my shoulder, I pushed onward toward my glorious whip, an HR-V 2016. It’s the first Chevy I’ve owned and hasn’t let me down yet. 

I walked to my parking space to reach the door. Before I opened it, something brushed against my back. I immediately turned with a bit of my coffee leaving my mug. There was nothing. I looked right, left, right again, then decided I was going crazy. My car wasn’t warm, yet, though I immediately pressed the brake and button to start it. My air was already on max from the previous my last time driving it blew out cold air just to reignite my shivering. I had become accustomed to warmer and humid climates. This winter and all was beautiful, as long as I didn’t have to leave to confide in my small, cozy house. Just as I put the car into reverse, a weird noise came from the trees. It sounded like a howl of some kind, but raspy and freakishly weird. Then I saw something. It seemed like a mist, but I couldn’t tell. It didn’t matter. My house was locked and I didn’t have much to steal. I also had cameras installed at every corner around the house, with two more inside. If anyone snooped around, let alone broke in I’d have everything I needed to identify them. Unless they wore ski masks and acted quickly. 

After overthinking and worrying, I decided to quickly run in and get my Glock 43 looked around, then jumped back in. I finally left my long gravel driveway and onto the road. It was odd, though. I still felt like I was being watched, but I was driving. There were no other cars around.

I had left early, as usual. It was an old habit and a hard to break even if I wanted to. But at least that meant I could relax when I arrived and make myself another cup of coffee. A friend of mine always told me my addiction to caffeine would be the death of me. I’ve learned that there are far worse ways for one’s life to end. But that hadn’t crossed my mind yet. I was concerned about parking closest to the exits so I could be one of the first to leave the corporate office. It was just outside of the downtown area.

“Good morning,” I greeted the secretary before scanning in.

“Good morning, Dev.” She replied kindly.

I returned a smile and nod before heading to the elevator. I remember there were balloons with all sorts of prizes. One sign said, “Party Tonight at Frank’s Family Home! Win up to $100,000. Earn $10,000 for showing you care for the WinTyme family!” I stopped, reread it, then read it another dozen or so times before I chuckled at the absurdity of the company’s CEO offering ten thousand dollars to EVERY single person who showed up. I knew there had to be a catch, but what was it? There’s no way anything this good would just be handed out. I know some people in my position are spoiled and have absolutely no concept of money, just buying a new car and iPhone every year. But I did. At least, I’d like to think so. And there’s no way our CEO would’ve done this out of the goodness of his heart. Two years ago was our best year and he laid off anyone with 15 years of work experience at the company. I took the elevator up three floors and was excited to find even more weirdness that I didn’t understand. A sign hung from the ceiling with rushed print, “Take off today if you sign up to come tonight.”

Okay, something was up. I suspected we were all getting laid off. There were outings here and there, but this was a full-on shutdown if I’ve ever seen one. I muttered curses just thinking of applying for another job. Thankfully the house I bought was a fixer-upper or my money would run up dry faster than I could get another job. Health insurance wasn’t a huge worry for me since I did have the VA to a small extent, but- fuck this shit.

Me being early, there’s usually Russell from another team and Joyce, an older project manager who was far smarter than you’d initially assume. At least, more than I realized. She notices the dirtbags, the backstabbers, and the good workers, but she keeps it to herself. It wasn’t until she gave a bonus only to Russell. He was the only one who finished his work, taking on other tasks depending on how far behind the others were. The other team members talked like they were the smartest and hardest working people in the department, but I could see Gloria on her Twitter and Facebook anytime I passed her desk. 

So those two weren’t a surprise to see here. What was a surprise, however, were the four women and three men in the big boss’s office. He was there, too, and I swore I could see watery eyes. Was he crying? 

One woman's head turned sharply towards me with her eyes piercing into my own. I began to feel similar to how I had this morning. It would’ve triggered every alarm in my mind if she hadn’t formed a long smile, showing white teeth that seemed impossible for a normal person to have. I forced a nob and then continued towards my desk. Before I sat down, my phone beeped. Once seated, I opened it. 

Russell texted, “Frank had been crying before I arrived. See the 10,000-dollar prize for showing up to his party?”

Right now nothing made sense. An odd urge told me I’d be better off leaving, but I couldn’t. I needed a job and money. Hell, if they were going to lay us off, I’d want that 10k, assuming no stipulations were attached. If I had known.

“What are the chances we are all getting laid off,” I texted, then added, “most of us, at least.”

Though I was tempted to look over, I waited for his response, seeing he was already typing.

His next message had me puzzled, “Frank just told Joyce he brought on three new employees and wasn’t letting anyone go until next year. She said most teams aren’t in any position to lay any members off, though I think a couple in mine wouldn’t be missed.” 

I thought for a moment before responding, “But that doesn’t explain the money rewards and party.” I sent it right after the office door cracked.

Frank formed a big smile, but his eyes were still slightly red. “Mornin’, Dev! Today’s gonna be a great day!”

Bewildered and uncertain which of my dozen questions I should’ve asked first, I decided to nod and go straight to the point, while leaving out his crying, “Why the rewards celebration, Frank? Are we getting cut?” 

I really shouldn’t have just asked, but he chuckled at the question, “No, not at all! We’re doing great and I’ve finally decided the best employees are the ones that feel valued.”

It took all my will power and focus to hold back a laugh. There is no way this was happening. None! Something wasn’t right. Maybe I was being paranoid, but my gut told me that a man with three offices, a Yacht, and a Porsche would never do this. Hell, how could he afford to? 

“I can see this seems a bit far-fetched to you,” he looked at me with a concerned look.

“It just seems a little much,” I replied.

“How about I give you a check for the 10 thousand right now if you promise to come to the party tonight,” he replied. 

The thing is, I didn’t want a handout. All I wanted was to earn my money. Granted, it would’ve been nice to receive a large bonus no matter what, but it didn’t feel right. Just as I was about to say no, one of the women came over to his side. The same woman who smiled just a few minutes ago looked absolutely stunning. Almost unnaturally so. Her hair was an ash blonde with bright red lips. She was also tall. I don’t mean your normal tall woman that’s 5 foot 9, but taller than Frank. I’d once asked him how tall he was after he said he didn’t believe I was 5’11. 

‘6 foot 3,’ he had told me. Not only was she at least a couple of inches taller, but somewhat muscular, too. I was beginning to feel like a dwarf below two giants.

“This must be-Dev, yes?” She replied in an accent I hadn’t heard before. Something absolutely alien to me, but I understood what she said.

“You would be correct, Miss-?” I asked.

“Carmille,” she replied with a long smile. “I would like to invite you, as well. We’re going to be workin with you all and we should get to know one another. Th-Frank is happy to be you! He wants you all to be happy working together.

I nodded, “Okay, ya got me! I’ll be there tomorrow.” Both their smiles widened as more people began to enter. While Frank turned to the others, she winked at me. 

Other people suspected the same things I had, but Frank tried to settle their concerns. Though me and Russell weren’t convinced, everyone else went home. All except us, until Frank insisted we leave in a nice manner unbecoming of him. Another woman talked to Russell before Frank kicked us out, but Joyce refused to talk to any of the new people. However, the most important people to socialize with for a good start would be the senior developers, engineers, and managers. Joyce hadn’t been approached once. Her years gave her extensive experience. I'd think they’d at least pretend they care, especially since the others went home. 

Just to be clear, I had no intention of going, but I needed to get out. To put it frankly, I had almost no family, no date for almost a year, and spent most of my time doing more computer work. Though I lifted and ran almost daily, I was a hermit. That gave me the thought to call an old friend, who I explained the situation to.

“Yup! You’re all getting canned, Johnson! Hate to break it to you,” that wasn’t exactly the input I was looking for.

“Then who are these other people? How experienced are these models? Something doesn’t add up,” I replied.

“I don’t know man, but you said the woman winked. I know she tall, but who cares?”

“Easy for your 6’4 ass to say,” he laughed at my response. 

“Treat yourself, man! What’s the worst that could happen,” his would come back to bite me in the ass soon enough, but I was unaware of just how large this problem was. 

“Thanks! Hopefully, I’m just being paranoid, but if I am getting laid off, a night out might not be so bad.”

“See, just start filling out applications the next day when they break the news,” he said and I chuckled.

That afternoon I bought protein pasta, chicken, and rice. I also snagged some Trojans and wine. Who knows what would happen? There were other women I barely talked to, so I decided this was the time to break out of my bubble. 

Frank's home was marked by a huge gate with a long driveway. I’ll say it was anything but modest. Now my anxiety was stronger than ever, wondering what this was about. I was beginning to think we were going to be scammed, but that seemed a bit much. Despite my reservations, I drove to the house. The snow had melted, so there was no problem. I was one of the first ones, again. At least there was no trouble parking here. Strangely, I remember Frank having pictures of him and his family outside his house and I could’ve sworn this wasn’t it. Was this a wealthier CEO’s place he knew? There was an unreasonable amount of parking space, even for a wealthy family. Then again, it wouldn’t have been the first time a rich family bought far more than they needed.

Still gawking, I followed a man waving towards the left side near a large lot. Past the side was a pool with a dive board, two boats, and a few cars. Nice of the owner to move his expensive stuff in the dirt. I had to be overthinking this whole thing. 

So I relaxed, let the man guide me back, and parked my car. I smiled and waved and he returned the gesture. He appeared to be anxious, but it wasn’t a big deal.

After leaving putting on only my favorite cologne and combing my hair, I passed a few strangers and entered the house. My first order of business was to drink something to calm my nerves. Second was to look for people I knew, especially Russell, Joyce, or Mac. Mac didn’t come to the office much, but he was a solid guy. Also, a Marine that I could shit talk with.

I had found wine, cheese of all assortments, and delicious steak bites that I’d happily helped myself to. If this was my last day on the job, I was going to get everything I could. You might say, “You’re not working,” but I’d argue that anytime I have to see the faces of my coworkers is me working. Excluding the previously mentioned. Funny enough, I couldn’t even see the tall blonde from earlier. Just as I was about to message Russell and Mac, a young redhead approached me, smiling. Her stare almost pierced my soul with green eyes. Eyes that I would’ve sworn transformed to slits for a moment. 

“Hello! I have not met you, yet. Dev, is it?” She asked in a nice, but odd tone. She also had the same accent as Carmille. Not Slavic, Italian, Romanian, or Japanese. I’d heard quite a few in my thirty years and this seemed truly foreign to me. Almost alien.

“Carmille told you?” I asked.

“Yes! Yes, she did!” she reached her hand out, “call me Lilith!”

I chuckled, taking her hand, “Lilith, I don’t suppose you know what this is all about?”

“About what?” she asked giving me a confused look.

“This party and, well, everything. It’s not usual. At least, I’ve never seen a CEO invite his employees, and offer a 10K bonus while providing wine, steak, and cheese,” I remembered just how insane this all was, making me reconsider staying here. At the very least I decided to stop indulging in the wine.

“I don’t know. Carmille invited me, though I was playing Road of Exiles and watching corgi videos before I arrived here,” she said.

“One, Corgis are adorable and I want a couple. Two, I just started playing it again. Early access comes out this coming month.”

“I would love to play it sometime. Maybe you could make me a better player,” her words made me question so much. Was she implying what I thought she was?

After some more chatting, she gave me a number. The reason I say it’s a number instead of her number is because it wasn’t a real number. 666-1289. When I asked if the area code was the same as the area, she seemed confused, but eventually answered with a yes.

More and more guests piled in. Only a handful, however, were from my job. I asked a woman where her friends worked and she asked if I was invited, like I was a weirdo. All I wanted to do was to get an idea of where everyone was coming from, but I gave up. When I looked for someone I actually wanted to talk to, I noticed the stares of other tall and oddly perfect people. They are what I imagined an android to look like. One moment they’d converse with the guests, the next they’d scan the crowd like a cat would a field of mice. One of them licked his lips standing behind a decent-looking fellow that struck me as a sales and business guy. I turned to look behind me and there she was. 

“Mr. Dev. How are you this evening?”

“I was just about to leave, to be honest, but nice to see you,” I lied out of my teeth. 

By this time I had realized that there were two groups. Us and these strange people. I felt an urge to run. To leave this house, get in my car, and drive away.

“You can’t! The party is about to begin. Frank will be here any minute, now with your reward,” the way she said that felt inhuman. 

“Okay. I’ll stay,” I replied.

Her grin became wide. Almost unnaturally so, “Good! I promise this will be an unforgettable night.”

I nodded with a smile, then turned around. I had absolutely no intention of staying. I just wanted her off my case. However, before I made it to the door, Russell flagged me down, possibly drawing attention I didn’t want. 

“How’s the night, Dev?” he asked.

“Russell, something’s not right here. I think we should leave immediately.”

“I can’t! I met a woman and,” he turned his words to whispers, “I think I might be onto something.”

“Oh, yeah? You know her name?” I asked hoping it wasn’t one of the perfect people.

“Lilith,” he smiled. “She said she didn’t know anyone, so I introduced her to a few people, even the woman from this morning.”

My heart dropped. Everything seemed more wrong than ever, but I still couldn’t put my finger on what was about to happen. “Carmille,” I replied, slowly.

“Yep! That’s her name! I keep forgetting it,” he said. “She also loves cats and The Expanse of Space.”

“Russell. She told me she likes Corgis. I’ve been looking into getting one or two for the past week. You like cats. She’s also interested in things, I’m sorry, most women do not like. Also, there are others like her that look too,” I struggled to finish my sentence, but he understood what I was saying.

”Perfect. Too perfect,” he replied. We looked at each other before looking towards the door.

“I still have my Glock, Russell. Follow me to my car. I’ll drop you off next to your car then we can drive the fuck outta here,” I said and he nodded. 

When we got to the exit, those men and women stared at us. Smiling. If you thought a McDonald’s employee's smile was fake, you haven’t seen anything yet. It creeped me out enough to pick up my pace. Russell followed my lead without hesitation. We exited into the night. Men began to trail us. I pulled my coworker to the right. As we picked up our pace, they did theirs. By the time we passed the first set of cars, we were power walking to my vehicle.

“Get in my car and I’ll get us out of here,” I told him.

“My car’s closer, Dev. I should just go to mine and you yours,” I didn’t like the idea of separating, but I didn’t have time to debate or think. 

“Alright. Go!” I responded.

He began veering to the left, as did one of our pursuers. Then I noticed them. There were a dozen or so people surrounding the lot. And the house. Russell pressed the unlock button for his car, but the man sprinted towards Russell. That run was like no other I had ever seen. I wasn’t even sure if we had running so much as gliding after a point. I didn’t bother to look behind me. I just ran, hoping to make it to my car in time. Then I panicked. I didn’t have a round in the chamber. I focused as I closed the distance to my car. The chasing footsteps behind me disappeared, and then a scream erupted. 

“Help,” Russell cried.

I wanted to help, but I couldn’t stop. I slowed down just to grab the door handle. As soon as the door opened, I reached into my side seat and pulled the gun. I reached to remove the holster still attached, but the thing pulled me away. The thing’s face changed. Its teeth were now razor sharp. 

“Where are you going, human?” After he finished taunting me, his mouth opened, darting towards my neck. 

But not before I chambered a round and began firing. The first rounds were in the chest. The last four rounds were placed in his skull while I pushed my gun from under his head. Though he dropped to the ground, his chest wounds were healing. At that point, I was shivering and my nerves were firing on all cylinders as I struggled to get inside my car. That’s when all the creatures began to converge. My foot hit the brake then I turned the key. As I put my car in reverse, I reached into my glove compartment for another magazine, preferably the one with ten rounds. 

My car tilted and grazed a few others in my attempt to escape. Screams erupted from inside the mansion. Tears were flowing down my eyes. I couldn’t help them. I wanted to, but I couldn’t. That’s when one of those things ran into my car, causing it to spin before flipping in the air. I held onto my gun for dear life feeling it was my only chance of making it out alive. Everything after that became dark.

The first thing I remember from when I regained consciousness was a salty smell. One vaguely familiar. Once my eyes opened, I saw the reason for this extreme stench. It was blood. An arm in front of me. I felt sick. My body was already weak, but this was almost too much. I closed my eyes for a moment to help myself cope, processing the events that had transpired. I took a deep breath.

“Alas, he is awake,” I knew that voice all too well by now.

“Fuck you,” I said. Then I remembered hearing Russell scream, “Where’s Russell?”

“He was an appetizer before the feast,” she replied in a disgustingly seductive manner.

“So you’re just going to eat people?”

“What can we do? There’s got to be something-” I man pleaded, but was cut off quickly.

“Please! We will do anything to save ourselves. That’s what your leaders said. Just before we had lunch,” she said followed by the creatures laughing. 

“Then why are we still alive?” a woman asked. 

I don’t know why she asked that. Probably fear and panic, but I had no desire to find out. Unfortunately, none of us were that lucky.

“You shall be sent to our reality at midnight, darling. There, you’ll see absolute beauty!” she replied like a mad woman on a high.

I wasn’t restrained, but my glock was gone. I had no idea how I would escape. My mind began to race with all sorts of ideas. I couldn’t have imagined what awaited on the other side and if I had known, I would’ve fought tooth and nail against those creatures.

Another said something in another language. It fit their accents perfectly, but I swore it wasn’t a language made by humans.

“Are you vampires? Aliens?” I asked, trying to stall.

She chuckled and ignored my question, responding in the language.

Looking around me, I saw at least a few dozen people. Granted, evidence all around us said some met a grisly end, but they spared most of us. Though I hated the question a minute ago, I was beginning to wonder what they had blamed for us. Looking around I saw more blood, limbs, vomit, smashed furniture, and those vampires staring at us. Everything except a weapon. I just realized I killed one with rounds to the head. But he could’ve healed. Then again, bullets to the head make more sense than a stake to the heart. I wasn’t sure what I should use, but I could snag a piece of a wood table leg broken off. Then I saw a kitchen knife against my leg. 

I realized looking around I couldn’t retrieve it just yet or one of those things would notice. Unfortunately, Carmille began a ritualistic chant, cutting her henchman’s throat before tossing it into a weird mist. It absorbs the creature, and then explodes everywhere. Some sort of particles fly outward, sending a dry warmth everywhere. A whole wall formed in front of us. When I noticed the vampires were looking at the portal, I grabbed the knife, and tucked it into my sleeve. People were being lifted on their feet before being dragged to the entrance. 

Though I desperately didn’t want to go through, I waited for the right moment to strike, but it never came. One of them began pushing me forward and I didn’t know if I could take him, let alone the others. Once at the edge, my skin began to tingle in pain. I turned while pulling the knife, but one of them kicked me through.
