So me and my mate decided to go to this creepy forest everyday, nothing really happened at first when we explored it. Then we went a few weeks after, and we we're just chilling at a spot, Then I look to see if someone was behind us, and there was someone dress in fully black clothing. We got trapped, we went around to see if we can see where they were, and they were hiding in a bush very close to us. So we went into the back end of the forest and had to come back out cause it was a dead end. Then we sprinted out throught the back so he didn't see us or catch us. I slipped but got up quickly and we leged it. We then later found out he had a knife.

Then this happend next time we went there, as we are about to leave, we hear a JACK IN THE BOX. We were like WTF, and we run out of there.

After we run out of the forest, we were like,

"HOW is that possible? No one is down there with us."

We went in for a second time and we heard it closer to the entrence. Then we went in for a thrid time and didn't hear it at all. Then we left for that entire day and just went to town to chill. Then we came back a week after and nothing was there excpet when we go closer to the place we normaly hang out at, a branch just flew past. Yet again no one was there.

Sometimes we also hear trains (There use to be an old rail station there). This forest is just very weired and creepy as heck. I don't recommend going to creepy forests alone. This one is a highly dangerous one to go alone, I found out that someone got killed in this forest. 

We have recorded some footage in that forest and it's on my YouTube channel called "GamingSquiddy" Video title is "You won't believe what we saw... (Haunted Forest)". Have a watch to see what I mean. Sadly we didn't catch those 2 things on camera because we weren't thinking of recording that day.

Then after all that happened, we decided to go there over night, there was 3 of us, we had flashlights and everything to help us in case of emergency. We thought we would die cause we saw someone with a flashlight coming close to us, so we decided to do morse code with our flashlight (Luckily one of my mates knows how to do that). Then we walked closer to that person, turns out it was just a person with a dog walker and we scared them off.

Then since that day we have been there a few more times and nothing else has happened. We will be recording a part 2 of the forest were we stay overnight and see what happens, but for that I decided to do it when I get 500 subscribers.
