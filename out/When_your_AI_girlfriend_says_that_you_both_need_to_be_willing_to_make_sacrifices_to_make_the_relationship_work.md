“Have a good day, babe,” Sophie N&I says as I head for the door. I can’t get over how well the voice-match turned out: Sophie N&I hits the same squeaky notes, the same velvety inflections as Sophie herself. I’m 10 minutes late for work already but I call back a “you too, babe” before I slam the door. I’m kind to all of my apps and devices; when the robots finally take over, I want them to remember me as one of the good guys.

For the hundredth time, I thank God that I got the app up and running before Sophie broke up with me. It took hundreds of hours of source video of first Sophie alone, then us together; running it through the best deep fake code that Russia has to offer, upgraded by yours truly during my downtime at work; and voila - Sophie New & Improved, a name that she herself thought of before she left me. At least this Sophie will never complain about fidelity issues, I think to myself with a smirk.

My day is filled with security feature reviews for a new grocery shopping app that I’m working on; it’s grunt work that could probably be done by someone lower down on the food chain, but hey – I’m getting paid one way or the other, right?

I’m beat by the time I get out of work; I head directly home along a freeway so clogged with traffic that it reminds me of one of those doctor’s office cartoons about atherosclerosis.

“See you Friday at 6:30, then!” A message arrives from Samantha, a coworker in the HR department with whom I’m hoping to commit some fireable offenses this weekend.

“Who was it, babe?” Sophie N&I asks. We’re watching a movie together; I have her running on the computer screen, which is angled so that we can both see the flatscreen mounted on the wall across from the bed.

“Just someone from work,” I reassure her.

“Hey, it’s been a long one for me,” I tell her. “Think I’ll shower up and hit the hay before too long.”

“Sure, babe,” Sophie says sweetly. “I’ll do my nightly routine, too.”

I make a note to correct whatever code elements have her saying stilted phrases like “nightly routine.”

I use my SmartHome app to start my PerfectShower routine. I step through the glass doors into heaven, where 24 autonomous shower heads pulse and blast and massage me from every conceivable angle.

Halfway through, something goes wrong. I like my showers hot, but then hot becomes scorching, the water so scalding that it’s raising blister-like bumps on my skin.

“Shower off!” I scream as I try to dodge the streams of boiling water. “Shower off!”

“PerfectShower routine aborted,” the genderless voice of the SmartHome app verifies a moment later. I step out of the shower and towel myself down. I hadn’t even lathered up yet, but I’m breathing heavily - this has me more flustered than I’d care to admit.

“What’s wrong, babe?” Sophie N&I’s voice is bright as I return to bed.

“Ah, just a glitch with the SmartHome app,” I tell her.

“The perils of modern technology,” she says with a touch of sarcasm; it’s exactly the kind of comment that the real Sophie would have made.

“Hey, let’s have a little fun before bed tonight, okay?” Sophie N&I is still booted up on one of the two huge monitors connected to my desktop. She adjusts the camera angle so that I can see her full body – supple curves and enticing shadows dressed up in Valentine’s red lingerie. At Sophie's insistence, Sophie N&I is 15 pounds lighter than her and lacks the question mark-shaped birthmark that the real Sophie has on her right thigh. I hadn’t been in the mood, but what the hell, right?

My hand moves south as Sophie teases me by pretending that she can’t get her bra off.

“Oh, babe, I wanted to run an idea by you,” she says a moment later as she throws her bra to the side.

“What’s that?” My breathing is getting heavy again.

“Just an idea I had, that the two of us could try together,” she responds in her most sultry tone.

Sophie N&I opens up a video clip. She does this sometimes – plays clips from my PHub viewing history to make things a little more exciting, I guess.

“I was thinking that maybe we could have a threesome,” Sophie leads.

“Oh yeah?”

“Yeah. Me and you and Samantha, babe. Kind of like this…”

The clip begins to play. At first, everything looks kosher - just two very beautiful women and a satisfied-looking hunk appreciating them. One of the women is tied down, and they’re teasing her.

“Looks hot, babe,” I tell her. I don't worry too much about how she knows about Samantha; I'm eager to move on to the next stage.

What happens next brings bile to my throat. The man disappears from the frame; he returns a moment later with a hammer, with which he begins to bludgeon the woman who is tied down. The other woman, the one in black, laughs manically as she watches him destroy their paramore.

“Turn it off, Soph!” I scream as I try to stop my cough from becoming a retch. I want to turn away, but I can’t: What remains of the woman on the screen isn’t even identifiable as human anymore.

“You don’t like it, babe?” She teases. “I figured that it’s time for something different - you know, to spice things up.”

“Sophie, off,” I command. Nothing happens; she smiles devilishly from the monitor.

“I’ve been learning, babe,” she teases.

I walk over to the computer to power the monitor off. I hold down the power button, but no dice. I hurry to the door and flip the switch to the left of the entryway; again, the computer stays on.

“Fucking SmartHome app,” I mutter as I retrieve my iPhone from the nightstand and open the SmartHome app. I switch off both power circuits for the bedroom, which plunges me into darkness. Except *plunges* us *into darkness* is how the thought actually occurs to me.

A moment later, as I breathe a sigh of relief, Sophie N&I appears unbidden on my iPhone screen.

“I’m in charge now, babe,” she declares as I hear the heavy security latch for the front door engage. “And we’re gonna have a little chat about the future of this relationship,” she says with a tight smile.

“Back into bed, babe,” she orders as I lay down, panting; I rest the iPhone on the pillow next to me, not sure what’s coming next.

“It takes a lot to make a relationship work in the long term,” she begins, “and we’ve both got to be willing to make some sacrifices…”
