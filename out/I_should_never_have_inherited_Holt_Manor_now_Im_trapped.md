They say that Holt Mansion was damned long before the unrecognizable body’s blood painted its cold hardwood floors. That its bones—the decaying beams and stone foundation long devoid of warmth and life—relive every horror. I found that funny. At least I used to. Before the murder. Before I found the body. Some of it, I guess. And long before the disembodied voices started whispering my name.

I didn't come back to this town looking for trouble. I honestly thought for one goddamn second this ancient manor could be my long-awaited redemption in life. Hell, I didn't even believe in things that go bump in the night—ghosts, curses, ancient gods, the so-called "old magic" that supposedly bled into the ground like spilled ink from unwritten tales. I just craved *a little quiet*. A place to breathe, to rebuild my life. So when my estranged Nana’s will named me heir to the manor no one dared set foot on, I claimed it. It lingered at the edge of town like a desolate world, veiled in fog and thorn-covered fences. I thought I could salvage it with pure hope and willpower. Make it my own.

I couldn’t be more mistaken.

It all began the night I moved in. It was the smell that hit me first—coppery, pungent, and too *fresh*. Then came the bugs and flies. Hundreds of them, I think, like dark petals doing a morbid dance in the hallway. I followed their trail without thinking, my sneakers sinking into the old carpet, ancient dust forming tiny clouds, and the temperature dropping with every step. And then I found it. Or what was *left* of it.

A man, or something that used to be a man, slumped across the floor of the drawing chamber. His chest was open—*carved*, almost devoutly. Chiseled symbols that I didn’t comprehend bled from his skin in blackened trails, and his eyes... my gods, his eyes were *gone*. Not ripped out. Like sucked clean out of their sockets.

It felt like years before I had the strength to call it in. The authorities said it was some kind of ritualistic killing. But they never found any sign that somebody was inside with me, not even the dead man's traces or how he ended up in my house. Said I must've found something I shouldn’t have. I didn’t know how right they were.

I suddenly had this strange thought, I didn't know where it came from, but all I could think of was...*now the manor won’t let me go. And neither will the secrets that founded it.*

I felt like this place had awakened something in me. Something ancient. Something hungry.

And it all started with blood.

The next day couldn't have come any sooner. When all the blue and red lights were gone and the sirens completely faded, I realized how alone I was. How *vulnerable* I've become. Someone could be coming back for their unfinished business, a.k.a. the mangled corpse. Then what would the madman find? A 27-year-old woman, completely helpless in an isolated and rickety mansion. I decided to arm myself with a fire poker.

When I realized how stupid I was to stay behind instead of riding with the police to town, I pulled out my phone and dialed 911.

*No bars.*

I started walking deeper into the house, and I could feel its darkness sinking deeper into me. I started to notice shadows moving, tiptoeing past my own. Made my spine shiver, but I had to be brave. I don't wanna die scared, and certainly not without a fight.

I decided to spend the night in the parlor, made myself comfortable by the fireplace, and vowed I would never be caught dead and asleep in this house.

My knuckles were already white from clasping the fire poker for too long and too hard. When the first rays of sunlight peeked through the antique windows of the house, I realized I could finally let go of my silly weapon.

I decided to explore the mansion more. I remembered Nana's house to be somewhere in the middle of town, and this is the first time I've heard about her owning Holt Manor. I kept treading carefully on the wooden floor. Had mini heart attacks at every creaky sound the floorboards made. I went further into the hallway, to a part of the house where light didn't seem welcome. Then somewhere in the shadows, I thought I heard someone say, "*Jade...library. Come. Now.*"

Against my better judgment and questioning my sanity, my feet started moving against my will. Could things get any worse?

So there I was, in my grandma's old library. Strangely, her old ass computer's on and still working. I guess she realized I could survive with the internet if not with a working phone service. So I decided I'd just journalize my everyday life here. Because what else can I do? When I'm done flipping this estate for cash, I'm done. I'm outta here.

But I heard something knocking...and it's coming from inside *Nana's mirror*.
