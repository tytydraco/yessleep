#  “I time traveled to one second in the past. I discovered the origin of everything.”

**Chapter 1: Transfer Initiation Protocol**

I saw fit that I should write my testimony after the events that unfolded, at least, such chronologically regimented events were, to me, an unhappening process when I first saw the clock that had struck at the last second of all existence.

In 2010, I was hired by a fusion research institute in Boston, Massachusetts after I graduated from Oxford University with a double major in theoretical nuclear physics and engineering. On my first day on the job, I clocked in that morning on time quite perfectly. “8:00.01,” I thought, “just one second off par.” After nearly a decade of research at WardenClyffe Scientific’s FuseTech division, our research committee achieved the first efficient magnetically confined fusion reaction capable of boiling water hot enough to spin a 1200 Megawatt turbine, equating the MW per hour of a normal fission reactor’s turbine. This breakthrough was only the beginning of the clean energy frontier, earning the inventor the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Nuclear Instrumentation. In 2018, our next project included doubling the size of the steel torus chassis, installing eight magnetic rings each twice the diameter of the length of an 18-wheeler trailer, and sixteen thermo conductive heavy water pipes through the center of the donut, each running to two 1400 Megawatt turbines and four cooling tanks. With over a year of assembling tens of millions of custom-manufactured parts, this 30 billion dollar project became the world’s largest fusion reactor, about 25% larger than ITER’s Tokamak.

Our goal was to produce heat. Lots of it. Exceeding the highest temperature ever produced by a factor of five: 1.1 billion degrees Fahrenheit. In three years, new developments allowed the reactor to push its temperature higher than previously thought possible, apt to turn ten turbines at 16% greater efficiency than the average American fission plant, producing one hundred times the power required to run it. The greatest flaw was maintenance. Due to the extreme temperatures, deformed aluminum tiles had to be changed every day, which was soon replaced with glass silicon fiber shingles. One day, an operator forgot to calibrate the magnetic strength of the giant coiled rings before the ignition, which usually does nothing but spark helium-3 gas. The reaction instead successfully bloomed into two bright violet bands.

Once the operator quickly turned the knob, the violet bands of ionized Helium-3 collapsed into each other into one band, releasing a surge of power directly from the machine. Upon discovering residual electricity at much lower temperatures, the use of the steam turbine was rendered economically obsolete. At just under 1 million degrees Fahrenheit, we designed the magnets to direct a string of ion bands moving clockwise at the roof of the chamber, then ignited a string of bands at the floor moving counterclockwise, milliseconds before smashing both bands together tightly around the center of the chamber’s donut hole. Each burst of energy burned at billions of degrees, generating vast amounts of power, earning our committee a Nobel Prize in Renewable Clean Energy and a multinational award.

Everything was great. We saved trillions of dollars in petroleum mining and coal-burning plants in the U.S. And then we discovered something bizarre that we would later regret having ever invented the reactor. Because the polarized plasma bands collided within 100-microsecond intervals, like two rivers fighting against each other’s currents, the Helium-3 protons created billions of microscopic black holes, firing out and hitting the chamber walls, each lasting as long as 10\^-30 seconds compared to the Large Hadron Collider’s 10\^-83 second black hole lifespan. Little did we know our institute hopped on a playground of dynamite when our new clean energy vision got dumped by endeavors to study black holes. Why cut off our decade-long project in the process of revolutionizing modern civilization? Nobody is certain, except perhaps to expediently excite third-party financial investors a third time with some grandiose idea that black holes will solve the energy crisis. Lo and behold, we did just that.

By combining black holes, electrons and radiation was released into the flow of Helium atoms and their fused protons. Then those holes grew to sizes large enough to consume those protons until the current emitted a stream of electrons straight into the chamber walls. The temperature at ignition begins at 1 million degrees, then cools down to only 500 degrees Fahrenheit. While the power generated was significantly lower than expected, the power required to perpetuate the black hole stream for one hour would equate to a single AA battery, breaking our previous record for the world’s most efficient clean energy producer.

The reason this great discovery became tragic news to us was that the fate of the world would forever be in the hands of the control deck, and we would be liable should the facility or the city of Boston, or the entire earth be sucked into a black hole. But even that would have been a better alternative to what I alone had discovered. You see, mass publicity of the most successful institute in the world breaking its world records leads to scientific arrogance in a frantic race to make history, reminiscent of the atomic bomb, the ICBM, and the Arms Race of the Cold War. Rather than a race driven by intercontinental pressure, ours was entirely a business show, like kids dissecting and showing off the coolest parts of a pressure-gauged warhead. FuseTech had unfortunately fallen victim to this ancient, intellectual arrogance.

One of the most terrifying projects I was involved in, titled, “Event Horizons,” endeavored to open and manipulate a black hole for one second before evaporation. Members of our committee included Simon Beavers and Christopher Hopkins, two field inspectors slightly younger than me, and Dr. Gertrude, an older lady in her mid-sixties who worked as both a secretary for Dr. Manry and an operations manager. I began the first phase of ignition. All the orbiting black holes combined into just two, each the size of a grain of sand, lasting 676.6 milliseconds before both evaporated simultaneously. Then I began the second trial, forming exactly two holes orbiting opposite to each other for 950.9 milliseconds. Then the third test, 999.3 milisecs. The fourth, 999.9 milisecs. Then the fifth, barely at 999.8 milliseconds, ready to shut off.

“Keep going,” Dr. Fisher Manry, the chief executive of the FuseTech division’s experiment, insisted, “we’re only at 200 megawatts. Shoot for 225.”

The machine boomed with a deafening hum, occasionally crackling and popping like a rocket. Bright sparks of white fire in the two opposing streams of violet-ionized gas flashed sharply on the camera monitor. I computed the collapse sequence and pulled the trigger. 1000.0 milliseconds; the one second. That instant, the chamber flashed with a loud POP of gunfire before the black holes evaporated.

“Shut it down!” commanded Dr. Manry.

I quickly brought the reactor to a halt, turning the chamber lights on. The CCTV monitor depicted what appeared to be a thin, perfectly circular, black ring around the chamber midsection.

“The camera sensor must have been fried,” I suggested, “beta particles can knock out light receptors and punch holes in the image.”

Dr. Manry said, half-listening,

“Interesting. Open the bay windows.”

The thick steel doors over the control center’s circular windows were hydraulically pried off. There it was. Floating in mid-air, wrapped around the torus center, was a black line no thinner than a hair.

Dr. Manry, looking nervous, turned to me, “Okay Isaac, this is where you come in. The field inspectors will meet you in the clean room to suit up. Recover a sample of the anomaly. Gertrude will be on the line.”

Gertrude overheard from the machine diagnostic computer and said, “Yup. And radiation levels are safe. Temperatures are cool enough now for entry,” then she asked Dr. Manry, concerned, “maybe we should wait and call authorities.”

“I will if the situation calls for it. The anomaly should just be compacted diamond or dense carbon, or at worst, an unknown, highly radioactive element.”

As a physicist, I was no fool to not find that theory strange, as none of the elements ionized could fuse into carbon-based configurations unless Dr. Manry had already simulated the particle statistics.

Wearing lime green trash sacks for HAZMAT suits, Simon and I climbed up a four-foot ladder under the chassis, opened the bottom hatch, threw the sample kit up through the door, and climbed in.

“Surreal,” I thought, as the echoey charred tile walls welcomed me with an unnatural sound reverberation you would only hear in skydome theaters elsewhere. The line was ten feet above our heads, with a radius of sixteen feet. I pulled out a Geiger counter from the supply case.

“No reading,” I tuned in.

“Strange. I’ll measure again,” Dr. Gertrude said through our headsets, “try setting your ladder up to get a better ping.”

“I’ll be careful not to touch it,” I promised.

I climbed up the ten-foot ladder, meeting the phenomenon at eye level. Oddly enough, no radiation was detected.

I tuned in, “Hey Gertie (short for Gertrude), what is the gauss on the magnets?”

“They’re zero.”

“Alright. Hey Simon, can you hand me the EMF detector?” I spoke as he handed it to me, “I want to see if our magnets electrostatically crushed our particles into carbon, seeing as it is completely black.”

“Why do you think it's carbon?” Simon asked me.

I thought, as though mentally doing chemistry math,

“Dr. Manry did, actually, but the only carbon fused here would be in the silicon shingles. I bet that’s the problem.” I continued as I climbed the ladder, “Besides, since switching from aluminum panels, we’ve always had problems, and… uh… well that can’t be right.”

Gertie tuned in, “What is it, Isaac?” asking me condescendingly.

“There is absolutely no electric field around the hairline. It just looks like a razor’s edge… totally motionless. I won’t touch it, but you could cut your finger right along it.”

She remained silent for a moment before I continued,

“Okay, we are attempting to take a sample of the specimen with our handy-dandy wire cutters.”

I climbed down the ladder, got the tool, and climbed up once more, with Simon holding up a test tube for me to drop a thread of wire in.

Simon warned me, “Careful. Slowly cut with your eyes closed in case it flashes again,”

I hovered the cutters around the hairline, shut my eyes, closed the blades, and suddenly, the ring loudly popped like a firecracker, flashing a torching white light like a magnesium oxidation reaction. I pulled back the tool, my hands stuck motionless. No. I feel my arm moving. Where did it go? Am I frozen? Paralyzed? Simon screamed when he caught sight of me, so startled he fell off the ladder.

“Report Isaac. What’s going on?” Gertrude demanded me.

Before Simon could get the words out, I realized I was not a statue.

Simon exclaimed,

“Isaac! Your face. Your arm. It’s stretching out. Crap. Don’t move!”

I stepped down a rung of the ladder, looking up in shock as though my right arm had fallen off. I was looking up at myself, completely motionless, holding the tools at the exact moment the cutters touched the line. I lifted my hands to see them in utter disbelief. My whole body made millions of copies of itself wherever I moved, leaving a grotesque trail of my stretched anatomy suspended motionless on the ladder. I heard fierce arguing in the control deck.

Gertrude commanded me in a trembling voice,

“Isaac, whatever you do, do not move. Do not get off the ladder. Do not touch Simon or anyone. We are sending a team to escort you out of there safely. Simon, leave all the supplies, leave the door open, and exit now.”

A long pause weighed on my traumatic situation as I saw through a thick cloud of my bright lime green suit and body parts clinging to the ladder. I saw my nose stretch when I tilted my head back, then I reinserted the nose going forward. I consoled myself with funny thoughts to distract my shaky trance, like, “I’ve worked here for ten years and still can’t get my head outta my butt,” as my head was currently inside the butt of my suit. Paramedics in lime green HAZMAT suits arrived outside the chamber with a stretcher.

“Isaac,” Dr. Manry tuned in, “slowly climb down the ladder, go around all the supplies. Do not step over them.”

I did, seeing my body stretching a long trail behind me. He continued, “Descend the ladder carefully.”

When I climbed out of the chamber, officers, paramedics, and security personnel stood around me at a distance.

“Hold it. There. That’s good. Stay where you are,” an officer commanded.

The officer then proceeded with questions while Simon scanned me for radiation,

“You are considered too dangerous to be questioned anywhere other than where you are standing. Is that okay?”

“I, uh…”

“Are you okay?”

“I think so. I feel like I’m in shock,” I said.

“How’s your pulse? Any heart palpitations, fibrillation, trouble breathing…”

“Fine. Really. No different, except my body is everywhere. I’m scared now. My knees are knocking,” I blurted out without qualms of being terrified at the sight of my hundreds of very stationary legs.

I saw a horrifying lime-green worm of body parts spilling out of the reactor hatch. I wanted to say something funny to console their terrified expression just so they would know I was still human, but I knew this was more serious than I was able to fathom, so overwhelming in fact, my mind broke, drowning in diverting thoughts into an intoxicating, enigmatic hysteria like a traumatized soldier laughing at his decapitated comrade.

Three men dressed for business rode with technicians on a roofless utility fleet cart through one of the side garages of the assembly building toward the crowd forming around me. I saw people begin recording me. Any attempt to cover this up has already failed at this point. Maybe they won’t need to. The technicians set up infrared cameras around me and a bomb rover with a built-in X-ray camera. Within thirty minutes, every worker on and off duty stood at a distance to record on their phones the horrifying frozen snake of arms and legs drooping out of the reactor chassis like an amalgamation of wet laundry hanging out of a washing machine. Every breath I took was ice cold, or at least, I felt my warm breath turn cold enough to sink to the floor.

“Isaac, do you feel close to hypothermia?” one of the technicians of the infrared camera asked me as others gathered around to see its screen.

“Not at all. Kinda hot in this suit, actually. I’m light-headed and my legs are tired. I think I need to sit down for a minute.”

A moment after I sat on the cold concrete floor, I heard a bomb rover squealing its motorized chain wheels, steering itself towards me. I overheard the technicians’ conversation.

“He doesn’t seem to have a clear heat signature. His remaining body is extremely cold. See. There’s Issac… on the floor…we need X-rays.” One of them called out to me,

“Isaac, hold still real quick. We’re taking your X-ray… in three…two…one…” The rover snapped photos, retracted its camera arm, deployed a laser thermometer, and aimed it along my elongated mass.

“How?” the bewildered operator said, “He’s deadly cold. Below freezing. It’s reading -271.1C.” Dr. Manry stood behind the operator and technicians, staring dumbfounded at the screen, postulated,

“His atoms appear frozen in time. Thermal radiation can’t emit from them. No radiation except visible light seems to reflect off of his suit.”

The rover touched one of my contorted gloves that protruded from the ladder.

“Solid,” the technician said, “like a solid wall. His hands are firmly stuck to the ladder. I don't know how we’re going to get it off.”

The rover poked at the sleeve, expecting the plastic suit to wrinkle, but it was frozen, as though I had bathed in liquid nitrogen. He then began a second phase of experimentation,

“Isaac, we’re taking a sample of your suit now. To be safe, we will cut some rubber off your boot and the tips of your laces. Extend your leg and don’t reach out to assist the robot.”

The rover cut rubber from the sole of my left boot, then it cut and pulled the shoelace out, leaving trails where they lightly swung from the toy claw, and dropped each into separate test tubes. He said,

“Crap. I didn’t think this through. The tube is stuck.”

Dr. Manry corrected,

“Turn it on its side, in his direction, and pull it out.”

The rover drove away, carrying the glass bottle with the opening facing toward my boot, drawing a dark rubber line in mid-air. Then the bottle shattered when the shoe lace’s trail filled its volume. After a quarter-hour of recovering the samples uncontained on ceramic dishes, Dr. Manry made a call after some dispute of how I would be moved without leaving streaks of my every atom in the facility.

“Feds are on their way,” I heard him murmur.

I sat for three hours, buried in not-so-solid parts of my body. It was dark in here. Outside voices became muffled. I heard an affirmative call,

“How are we doing in there, Isaac?”

I felt crippled like I had lost eyesight, coping with thoughts of an unforeseen lifestyle I now have to endure.

“I’m worried I won’t ever leave this place again. I think I’m going to die. The more I move, the more ‘me’ there is.”

I could tell no one was listening. I was, in their eyes, just a circus anomaly. I lay on my back, dizzy from existential stress. Gertie was right. We should’ve waited to call the authorities.

I heard a helicopter beating wind on the roof of the enormous assembly building, landing somewhere near the parking lot. I heard news crews gather at the site. I slowly crawled out of the amalgamation to see hundreds of photographers outside the building fenced behind police tape. Flashing red and blue lights flooded my vision as black vans swarmed the grass lot, and multiple military helicopters landed close to the building as I overheard the distinct chatter of, “President.” The Massachusetts state governor with the state attorney general arrived shortly after.

An hour later as the sun was setting, there he was. U.S. President Conner Reinking flew from the White House, arriving in Boston in the Marine One helicopter, landing on one of the empty lots. I never felt such surreal notoriety before upon seeing the man of America duck under the police tape, saluted by the marine corps as the green alien beast befell his eyes. Then I heard a distinctly familiar female voice calling my name.

“Isaac!” she called for me.

I stood up, completely obscured by my bodies, and inched myself forward to see her. I thought I must be dreaming. My wife stood in front of a crowd of over a hundred scientists, police officers, military personnel, paramedics, doctors with radiation equipment and satellite dishes, and men in black.

“Amelia?” I called out, but the crowd was too loud to hear me.

The President greeted Amelia, standing next to her to speak first before handing a megaphone to her. The crowd silenced, and the teams stopped what they were doing. He then turned the volume up just enough to hear him address me, stepped up on a soapbox, and said,

“Mr. Coffman, this is the President speaking. Can you hear me?”

“Yes Mr. President,” I said enthusiastically.

“I came to inform you that five research institutes from around the world are working tirelessly, determined that they will not stop until they have completely restored you back to your family. Mr. Coffman, I give you a word of hope for you and your family and encouragement in this arduous situation. America bends a knee of prayer that you return home safely.”

I responded,

“Thank God. Please get me out of here! My face is in my crotch, I think. I will be okay for a while.”

The President chuckled, affirming me,

“Now, Mrs. Amelia, your beloved wife, has some words for you,”

She stepped up, megaphone in hand, and said anxiously,

“Isaac. Isaac, wherever you are, I’m here for you. I’m scared. Be strong for me, okay?”

I inched forward, revealing my form outside the floating lime-green mass, hearing her lightly gasp.

“I’m here, honey,” I said faintly.

I unzipped the suit’s head and took off my mask, showing my rapidly smearing face.

“I’m coming home. Don’t worry. I’ll be strong. They’re gonna get me out of here,” I bravely ascertained through the frozen statue of my face.

“Hoo-rah,” all the rescue teams cheered, along with members of various divisions and first responders chanting, “USA! USA!”

I then asked Amelia, “Where are the boys?”

“In the lounge. I can bring them here.”

“Please do,” I said as my voice broke into a cry at the thought that I was standing inside my grave, ready to be buried alive.

They came, and I wanted to hug them. A single handshake would fuse their hands to a freezing claw. The boys spoke to me like I lived to hear my eulogy. My oldest son said,

“Everyone is in the lounge.”

“Really? Okay. Can you tell grandpa I’m alright? Also, there is a soda machine down the hall on the right. Can you roll me a can?”

He chuckled, “I’ll tell grandpa to get you a pickle, ‘cause you sure look like one.”

“Ha!”

“Any flavor?” He asked.

“Yeah. Except for Fanta. I don’t like sour juices. Grandpa might have some cash.”

I then asked Amelia, “Hey honey, what time is it?”

“It’s almost eight o’clock,” She said before the President got word of tonight’s plan.

She gave him the megaphone and he announced,

“Mr. Coffman, I got good news and bad news. I’ll tell you the bad first. You are going to have to sleep where you are tonight while the international society of nuclear science pulls an all-nighter to assess possible solutions. The good news is, a report will be written and ready to begin trials tomorrow.”

At around 11 pm, the news and press crews began to leave, then the men in black with the President and the marines thirty minutes later. All members of the science community left by midnight.

I could not be any more grateful to Gertrude and the rest of my team, because hours after their shift ended, they stayed here to support me until all was assessed for the night. I was given a mattress, sheets, and a toilet sheltered by a curtain rack. I laid my head down, unable to pull the blankets over me. I wondered where my family slept. They probably went home. Nonetheless, I was alone in the dark, seeing only a green ceiling alarm light flash occasionally and hearing the motors of ventilation units starting and stopping.

Then came the silence.
