To provide some context me and my friends are Urban Explorers. We go to abandoned locations in hope to find something crazy. Sadly the craziest thing we have found was a working mall pony.

My friend Devon and girlfriend, Lex often accompany me. Devon had a successful youtube channel with around 500 followers. The videos were of our adventures. 

One day while Lex was scrolling through some Urbex chat server, she found a location. This was how we often got our spots and usually they were pretty cool. Nothing could've prepared me for this. 

Lex said it was an old theme park from the 1940s. It was themed as Olympus. I was surprised given the fact that it was built in '45 and still standing. Apparently the park closed down in 1949 because a kid fell off the ferris wheel.

The drive was about 2 1/2 hours long, luckily since I was a dirt poor college kid, Devon drove us. Devon came from a more well off family. His parents were both heirs. Dont get me wrong Devon was loaded but he wasn't a snob. He was quite generous, honestly.

Anyways, when we arrived, we were disappointed. The place was more rust than a site. Still, we checked it out. If I went back in time I would've gotten right back into that car. But I didn't. 

Lex being the one on the computer was the most knowledgeable about the place, even more so because of here degree in religion. She begged me to go because she was interested in the Greeks and, at the time, learning Greek.

We walked around for a while not seeing much but some over grown rides and restaurants that were literally falling apart. Then we decided to split up. Before we did, I took Devon's keys because I had a bag. Lex went towards the famed ferris wheel which they had fittingly named "Mount Olympus".  Devon went inside an old resteraunt, and I wen towards the rest of the rides to test if anything worked.

I was always the one testing to see if things were working since I was getting my degree in engineering. I also always had a tool bag. I went over to a ride called "Flight of Hermes". It was your typical up and down spinning, kiddy ride. Its cups were shaped as Hermes' winged feet.

I pressed the lever and the machine whirred around, creaking and rattling. I was very surprised. This thing was almost 50 years old (to give you a refrence to the time). But as I was about to stop it, i heard Lex's blood-curdling screech.

I ran towards the ferris wheel to see her shocked.  I looked down. I was shocked but not, bloody-murder-scream shocked. It was a pool of dried blood. Presumably where the kid had landed. I then remembered Lex's biggest fear was blood. I calmed her down, not voicing my concerns as to how it was still here, given that it had most-likely rained here at some point.

I started to get bad vibes. Something was off about this place. Then I remembered, the ride was still on. I told Devon and Lex to follow me. I showed them the ride. As they looked in amusement the ride started to get really fast. Not like, normal fast, more like 100 mph fast.

A thunderbolt struck and it stopped. 
"What the hell just happened?" Devon exclaimed.
We decided since it was about to rain we should head out and come back again.

We were about to hit the parking lot when we heard an enthusiastic, "Hi there".

It sounded like some cartoon character. I turned around to see a man probably in his mid 20s to early 30s. He has a red and white toga on. 

"Uh who are you" Lex said.

"I'm Tommytheus!" He shouted to us, like we 
were little kids.

"Do you work here?" I chimed

"Duh silly!" He said.

"Isnt this place abandoned?" Devon asked.

"Well kinda... I'm the only one here," He said sorrowfully "Just follow me!"

Of course we followed behind, very confused.
He or should I say, it, led us to a little stand that I swear we had walked past. It was brightly lit with a gold and black color scheme. It wasnt easy to miss. 

"Were selling Nectar!" It piped

"Nectar?" I said.

"Yes! The drink of the gods!" It giggled

I saw Lex's eyes light up knowing she loved this topic. 

"We have free samples," It said "YOU try some!" It pointed to Devon. Weirdly its voice got much deeper, so much I flinched, it's like it wasnt asking Devon, It was demanding him.

"Uh... ok" Devon was the shy type he didnt like being pulled into things or being in big groups, that's why he enjoyed Urbex so much.

I watched as Devon pulled the paper cup towards his lips. It was filled with a liquid that could be mistaken for honey, I assumed it just WAS honey, it sadly was not. It was indeed the real nectar. 

The cup touched his lips as he sipped. 
"Mmm-" He looked pleased, then pained. He let out the most horrendous wail, like a beast was clawing out of him. He rose above the ground, like he was possessed. He was screeching, wriggling, clawing! As he let out a louder yell he began to turn yellow- no, gold. He looked like pure metal and then he dissipated like paper on fire. He was dead. His blood had turned to Ichor. 

I screamed. Me and Lex ran and the thing went from a smiling man to a black, shadowy creature. It chased us down, floating. It was so fast and then it grabbed onto Lex. She was suspended mid-air. She was choking. I then remembered my tools. I grabbed my favorite hammer which Lex put some hellenistic spell onto. A luck spell. I threw with all of my might hitting the thing square in the head. It yelped, suffering a similar fate to Devon. Dissolving. Lex took a breath realizing she was alive. She hugged me and the ground opened up swallowing her. Like a well.

I had no time to grieve. I ran, crying to the car, remembering I still had the keys. I drove so fast, weeping the whole way. I stille havent recovered because nobody believes me. The place is gone. It's not on any map, forum or chatroom.
