I am posting this here because I have heard of people asking for help and advice when strange things happen to them and they don’t know where else to turn. That is not what I am doing. It has been a long night. My head is still ringing with pain. I could be wrong and my lived experience fades into the abyss. But if I’m right… well maybe this saves some of you. This is not a plea for help or advice, no, this is a warning. Below I have chronicled everything I can remember from my experience last night.

“Reed, you aren’t even on your way yet are you?” I practically shouted into the phone as soon as the call was answered. After a couple seconds of silence I started to think Reed had hung up on me.  
  
“Im rounding the block now but I’ll turn around and head back home if you’re gonna give me shit for being two minutes late.” he finally snarked back.   
  
“Yeah yeah. Well when you actually head this way, stop and grab us some beers.” I said through a laugh.   
  
“Yeah right.” Reed scoffed with an audible grin, and hung up.   
  
The sudden end to the call brought another laugh out of me. Knowing there would definitely be longer than two minutes until Reed arrived, I grabbed a beer and flipped on the TV before parking myself on the couch.  
  
I was excited for the evening. Knowing it would consist only of drinking beer and playing shitty video games didn’t damper the mood. Despite life getting in the way more times than not, Reed and I have always tried to hang out regularly. Though it was much easier when we were both in high school and lived just down the street from one another.  
  
A loud thud broke through the dull murmuring of the TV and my thoughts. Nearly jumping out of my skin I lurched from the couch, immediately turning to face down the hall. The sound could have come from the bedroom or from just outside the house. I was sure it originated from that direction at least.   
  
I worked my way down the hall slowly. The squeaky wood floors outside the bedroom ruining any attempt of sneaking around. Opening the door and quickly scanning the room nothing looked out of place. The wind audibly howled outside the bedroom window. Maybe a tree limb blew into the house and caused the noise?  
  
The open curtains revealed very little of the night happening beyond the glass. Approaching the window I crouched down, resting my hands next to my face, directly on the glass. An attempt to block out the reflection coming from the lights down the hall. Through the fog on the glass from warm breath, faint outlines of trees and bushes were visible. Just as my eyes fully acclimated to the darkness a loud rapping came ringing through the house. Immediately jumping out of my skin, I was much too close to the window to avoid making contact as I turned to face the direction of the sound.  
  
The dull thump of my head against the window sill didn’t hurt as much as it just caught me off guard. Awkwardly falling sideways I landed cross-legged on the floor. The metal clicking of the front door handle took my attention back down the hall. I was on my feet moving down the hall, heart pounding, as someone came around the open front door into view.  
  
I couldn’t help slumping against the hallway wall when the realization hit me that it was Reed. My sharp exhale also told me that I had been holding my breath since, at least, the knock on the door. Reed still stood in front of the open door, clearly confused.  
  
“Uh, Jake?” He said, raising one eyebrow.  
  
I rolled my eyes.  
  
“Oh, I see. I’m interrupting something.” Reed chuckled. Shutting the front door behind him, he walked to the kitchen and sat a 6-pack of beer on the counter. All while side-eying me with a look that could only say he was in the middle of thinking up his next quip. The lightbulb must have gone off because his small smirk creeped into a grin and the blue of his eyes sparked with excitement.  
  
“Like that time y-…”  
  
“Fuck off.” I cut him off as I righted myself and walked to the kitchen counter, opposite Reed, who was still laughing at the joke he didn’t get to tell.  
  
“You good?” Reed asked. Sincerity in his voice.   
  
“Yeah, just tripped.”  
  
“Ah, started without me huh?” Reed eyed the beer on the living room table.  
  
“Not even. But we can start now, it’s been a while.” I opened one of the beers on the counter and handed it to him.  
  
“Yeah… Yeah I know.” Reed sighed. “I really just haven’t had the time between work and school.”   
  
“You don’t have to explain yourself to me. I’m just giving you a hard time.” I said.  
  
Reed nodded and tipped his drink back.   
  
“Speaking of not hanging out, I don’t see Grace.” I stated inquisitively.  
  
“Is she coming?”  
  
“Well you were supposed to pick her up.”  
  
“Better call her and tell her I ain’t coming then.” Reed chuckled.  
  
Already pulling out my phone, I just rolled my eyes at him. When the phone started ringing I sat it on the counter in front of us.   
  
“Jake?” Grace answered the phone quickly.   
  
“Yeah, bad news. Reed decided to pick beer up on the way here instead of you.”  
  
“Not even surprised.” She laughed, but she sounded disappointed.  
  
“Think you’ll be able to make it?”  
  
“No, I don’t think so. You know the rain stresses me out.”   
  
“The roads aren’t going to get slick or anything, you’ll be fine.”   
  
“I really think I’ll just sit this one out. Maybe next time. Sorry guys.”   
  
“Okay, well, feel free to show if you change your mind!”  
  
“Roger that. I’ll let you know.Y’all have fun!” Grace said.  
  
I sighed and looked at Reed “Just us for this one.” He shrugged. He seemed unbothered but I knew he felt really bad forgetting to pick Grace up. He always had a tender spot for her, even if he wouldn’t admit it.  
  
Reeds attention shifted quickly. He moved from leaning on the countertop to moving through the kitchen. He shuffled around, through the cabinets and shelves before spotting the lunchbox on top of the fridge. Taking it and putting icepacks from my freezer in it. Moving back around the countertop he caught my, obviously confused, stare.   
  
“What? If it’s just going to be you and I, I’m not planning on leaving your couch.” He dumped the pack of beer that he brought into the lunchbox, and ambled across the room, before dropping himself and the lunchbox onto the couch.   
  
Following his lead I made my way into the living room. Reed was already fumbling with the TV remote trying to wake it from sleep mode. Knowing how these nights usually go, we would probably bicker over a video game until one of us were too drunk or tired to do so. I lowered myself down and started pulling the video game controllers from the drawers of the TV stand. Although Reed must have accidentally muted it, the TV whirred to life. He grumbled something incoherent behind me as I stood up, turning to face him. He looked frustrated.  
  
“I don’t know why anyone watches this shit. Especially you, you’re already depressed enough.” He spit out.  
  
After moving a few steps towards the couch to allow an actual view of whatever Reed was talking about, I turned toward the TV. In the split second of seeing the TV before Reed flipped the channel I recognized it was the news station I had turned on before he had arrived. Only now it was not the weather forecast. Aside from the Local 8 tag in the top right and the scroller at the bottom, the screen was filled with small squares. Each a picture of a person. The channel turned too quick to make out anyone individually or what the scroller at the bottom was saying.   
  
“What was it?” I asked as I looked back toward Reed.  
  
“I don’t know with the sound being muted and I missed what the headline was, but the scroller at the bottom was talking about missing people.” He paused, inhaled deeply and sighed. “I don’t know and I don’t care to find out. Theres too much negative shit out there in the world and it can really get to you if you surround yourself with it all the time.”  
  
“Damn. No I definitely get it.” I agreed, just the mention of missing people left me unsettled. Slumping onto the couch next to him, I threw a controller onto his lap. “BUT the only negative thing you need to worry about is me beating your ass on the game all night.”   
  
Reed shrugged. “That would be a first.” He cracked open two more beers for us and booted up the game.   
  
Being inebriated definitely increased the difficulty of the game. A game that wasn’t all too easy to begin with. Between that and the conversations happening concurrently, very little focus was actually lent toward winning. This was very evident as after only a beers worth of time, Reed was beating me 8-2.   
  
“What happened to Mr. Winner!” Reed said through a laugh.  
  
“Same as always. I’m letting you win.” I said while being as deadpan as I could. Reed immediately turned and punched my arm.   
  
“My ass you are! I’m beating you so bad I’m getting bored with it.”  
  
“Yeah yeah. Sore winner. But speaking of getting bored with it. I’m gonna take a break and get a snack. Want anything?”   
  
“Thats a damn good idea. I wonder if Grace would come over and bring a pizza with her.” Reed said, almost giddy at the idea.   
  
“It’s not super late yet, I can give her a call and see if she’ll change her mind about coming over.”   
  
As I pulled my phone from my pocket three loud knocks rang out from the front door. Quickly looking over at Reed, we both shared the same confused look before turning our focus to the front door. Another set of knocks rang out and snapped Reed out of his trance.   
  
“Well well well.” Reed chirped in a sarcastic tone. “Speak of the devil and he shall appear.” I was still glued to my seat as Reed stood and hurdled the couch in nearly one motion. I stood to follow him. Reed was still talking as he turned the lock and began to open the door. “Looks like Grace decided to show her face after a-… oh… Hi.” He paused for a moment. “Hey Jake!” He said loudly, never turning away from the door. Covering the few steps to the front door in a second, I stood next to Reed. Looking into the night at the stranger outside.
