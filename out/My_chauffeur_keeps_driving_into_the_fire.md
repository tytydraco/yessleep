There was a man behind the turnstiles.

A plain-looking man, tidy, lean, with a languid expression across his face. He waited amongst the flood of professionals scurrying through the lobby in all directions. Had it not been for his crisp suit and flat cap he may have faded into the background, lost in the flurry of activity and the din of the lunch-hour traffic.

I wouldn’t have noticed him, had it not been for the sign he was holding with my name on it.

“How long has he stood there?” I asked.

Judith popped her head up from the classified ads and replied, rather disinterested, “Oh, just about an hour now, surely.” I had known the head of security for years, but could never picture her laying herself on the line for the safety of others. She rarely left her stool. And her co-worker was a new face, but he seemed more of a boy than a man.

There was no reason to suspect this man of anything other than jamming up my Monday afternoon. But still…something felt off about the man, and I was not the type for surprises.

I took him in a moment longer. He greeted me from afar with the tilt of his hat.

“Can we not send him away?” I asked Judith, dialling my voice down to a polite whisper.

“We’ve tried,” she responded, “short of ushering his ass to the curb there’s really nothing we can do.” She glanced back at her partner playing on his phone and looked up at me with an abrupt confidence. “We’ve got no problem doing that though. Just give us the word.” She returned to her paper, casually turning the page.

I managed to fight off a chuckle, but a rogue smirk emerged.

“He’s adamant he was sent to get you,” she mentioned tauntingly. “Says he can’t leave until he sees you.”

I sighed, muttering under my breath. “I *really* don’t have time for this shit, Jude.” Not with the mountain of emails flooding my inbox. Not with the back-to-back conference calls and meetings. The news had hit last week, but the aftermath had a cascading effect that seemed to be endless. It meant a lot of late nights and splitting headaches.

The gates beeped as I swiped my card and walked through. I stormed the desk from the other side.“If I’m not back by 1:30 PM, please give Stella a ring.”

Judith mumbled something back in the vague spirit of yes. The boy didn’t even look up from his phone.

“Mr. Mooney?” Tucking the sign underneath his arm, he graciously held out his hand.

“Can we not send him away?” I asked Judith, dialing my voice down to a polite whisper.

“Splendid,” he replied, turning for the exit.  “We’re rather late. It shouldn’t be a problem if we leave now.”

“Hold on a second, will you?”

The man’s forehead bunched up.

“Who sent you?” I asked.

The thin smile was wiped from his face. Stroking his bottom lip, he seemed to ponder a response, but no words were offered in return.

“Who sent you?” I repeated.“It’s a simple question, really. My assistant has no memory of an appointment over lunch hour and my calendar remains empty. Quite frankly, I’m inclined to send you on your way.”

More stroking, his fingers now migrating to his chin. After another pause, he spoke softly, “We really must be going, sir.” For a second, I detected a hint of fear.

“And where would we be going?”

His mouth opened, albeit brief, before regretfully clamping shut. More silence. Averted eyes. I scoffed and left him in his place. I made it down the hall and halfway up the lobby stairs, the smells of the food court on the tip of my nose, before I felt a firm grip on my shoulders.

His words were sheltered under his brown leather glove, but his voice was brash and urgent. “Shall we step outside, sir? So we can talk?”

I studied the man as lunchgoers continued to pass. Appalled by his sudden use of force, but intrigued by the veil of secrecy, I stepped out into the brisk wind with him. The sounds of the city followed us to the polished limousine. Snow fell delicately from the cloud-filled skies.“This better be good, or so help me God.”

He leaned against the vehicle with slumped shoulders, and I could feel it in his gaze.

It was the look of a man just trying to do his job.

“It’s Mr. Walter Whaylen, sir,” he whispered. The breeze nearly blew the hat right off his head.

*Walter Whaylen, you dirty dog*. The name stirred up some unforeseen butterflies in my stomach. Amid a potential sales process, competitors would do just about anything to sweeten the deal; the line between “gift” and “bribe” were blurred, which didn’t bother me in the slightest. I had fought tooth and nail to rise to my position, there should be a little whipped cream at the top for executives, as far as I was concerned. That was how negotiations worked.

But Walter Whaylen was an unlikely buyer. Somewhat of a mystical entity, known for being a cutthroat and ruthless bastard in his consolidation approach; it was a name often feared, and a face rarely seen. A powerhouse in the asset management territory, but entirely absent in the insurance space, from what I could remember. But maybe that was the point. Everyone needed life insurance. And I welcomed the challenge with open arms. I had been known to be a shrewd, stubborn bastard myself.

“It was meant to be a surprise, sir,” the man added, nervously. “So, please…no mention, will you?”

“Of course. My lips are sealed.”

There was a sudden breath of relief from the man. “Come along, then,”  he urged, holding the door open. “We mustn't keep him waiting.”

I slid into the back seat, as the last gust of winter air and city racket swept into the vehicle. The smooth heated leather welcomed my frigid fingers. The door shut with an empathetic thud.

The engine hummed as he turned the key. Then a grin poked up at me from the rearview mirror.

“You’re riding in the T4 S-Class,” he said, his pale eyes glimmering with pride. He continued to rattle off the extensive upgrades the vehicle offered. Bulletproof windows. A complimentary bar, stocked as generously as a nightclub. Shelving units stored with snacks and beverages. Everything one could wish for. The glee seemed to ooze out of the man in this environment where everything seemed to dazzle, and he was in control.

I caught a glimpse of him searching my reflection in the mirror, looking for some sign of acknowledgment or recognition. My eyes were largely fixed on my phone. An email regarding the Woodworth estate had just popped up. Another requesting updated powerpoints for the upcoming board meeting. I told him it was all very nice and tended to my work.

I hate to admit it, but I had become accustomed to certain luxuries. It was where we were going that got my juices flowing. Lunch at a Michelin restaurant? Box seats for a home game? Greg had stories of hush-hush underground strip clubs. What kind of man was Walter Whaylen?

“You know, the president hasn’t ridden in something like this,” he noted, sharply, pulling the vehicle into motion. “The president, Mr. Mooney.”

The man’s smile vanished as he placed his finger on the button. The privacy screen vibrated upward.

\*\*\*

In the end, it was a phone call that woke me. I wiped the trail of drool from my cheek and patted the damp collar of my dress shirt. How long had I been out? I panicked. For the first time in a long time I had dreamed—the bleary visions left vague wisps of something dark, something sinister, the details of which eluded my memory but left me with a groggy mind and pounding heart.

The heat was turned up to an uncomfortable level. Sweat pooled up in dark stains around my pits, beads dripping down my brow. But most of all, I felt disconnected. I clawed at my pockets, the ringer still dancing its merry jingle. I gawked in horror when I realized where it was coming from.

The tune sailed back to me from the front seat.

The eyes of the driver met mine, gleaming in the rearview. The look was far from dull now, it was something frightening, a look ablaze with something…something I didn’t quite trust.

“Nice nap, Mr. Mooney?”

The ringer died.

“Yes…thank you,” I mumbled back, still stunned by the strange predicament. With the privacy screen lowered a crack, I could just make out the hazy beams of the headlights chopping through an otherwise crippling darkness. The road was rocky, bobbing the vehicle from side to side as the gravel and lack of street signs sent me into a flurry of distress.

*How long had we been driving?*

“We’re getting close now. Don’t worry.”

“Where the hell are you taking me?” I probed.

*…And why was it so dark?*

The tint was impossible to see through now, but what I could make out around me left me wary. Strange greys, flickers of discolored shadows, splashes of faint light dancing behind the shaded windows.

And the suffocating blackness up ahead.

“Well, Ken—” the driver started. The car suddenly lurched to the left, steamrolling through something solid. “The truth of the matter is we’re almost there. But you’ll need to be making a decision.”

“Give me back my phone,” I ordered. “I’ll dial Walter Whaylen directly. Wait till he hears about this wild goose chase you’ve put me through. You need to stop this. Now.”

“There’s no stopping here, sir,” the man laughed, madly. His eyes were wide and alert, both hands gripping the wheel with tense wrists. “No, you wouldn’t want that at all.” It was as if the flat road had disappeared, the car was now bumping and jerking its way down a tiny hill of moguls.

He reached over his shoulder and lazily tossed back my phone. It toppled backward, inches from my lap. “It won’t do you much good, but here.”

Scrolling past the emails and missed calls, the worrisome text messages from Stella and my wife, I found myself in tears.

“Tell me what you want?” I begged. “If it’s money, you can have it. Just let me go...Please...”

“It’s not what *I* want,” the man said, “it’s what *he* wants. And please, consult whoever you need to make your decision. It’s a big one, after all. And Mr. Whaylen drives a pretty hard bargain.”

My hand shot to the door handle. It didn’t bulge. It burned. I recoiled from the touch, the skin on my palm raw and searing with pain. Something guttural escaped from inside me, whimpers mixed with moans of dread.

We were heading down an unsteady decline. It felt like a cruel ride, the roller coaster creeping inch by inch before the inevitable drop.

“Where the fuck are you taking me—” I yelped, searching for a name and realizing there was none to speak of—no name tag clipped to his lappel. No company logo. No identification.

“Who are you?” I trembled.

“Names,” he shook his head, “names like Walter Whaylen, Mr. Mooney…These things are just labels. Pseudonyms,. Something to serve the higher calling. What you need to be concerned with is your decision.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” I sneered.

“Are you willing to sell?” he smiled, a nasty, conniving grin. “He wants everything.”

I kicked at the window, my feet pounding against the glass like a tantruming little boy. Each stomp bounced back, the scent of burnt rubber in the air. “Let me out!”

“Or we can keep driving. You choose.”

“Let me the fuck out!” I screamed, emptying my lungs in a shrill shriek that dissipated into a fit of sobs.

“We’re about to hit the tunnel now,” the man warned.  “I’ll need an answer...and quickly.”’

The darkness gave way to haunting flickers of light off in the distance. As we approached closer, I could see the glowing eyes. Millions of cloudy beads, their ghoulish skeletons and the *thump* and *whump* of the vehicle running over their outstretched gnarled hands. Their flesh slipped off their bones like goop. An arc of flames steadily approached, plumes of brimstone and clouds of souls whisking around the entrance in billows of demented faces. They floated towards the vehicle as the rusty gate slowly swung open. More bodies approached the vehicle, bringing their choruses of wails. There was scratching at the windows now, on the rooftop, the undercarriage. The creatures clung on, clawing desperately to get in.

The man placed his sunglasses on and took a heavy breath. He made one final glance in my direction and shrugged:

“Suit yourself.”

Then we passed through the gate.

\*\*\*

There was the phone in my palm again. The sunlight, the sounds of the city pouring in before the door slammed shut.

 This time, I noticed the light dusting of snow that trickled in from my suit. The flakes sparkled as they fell before melting away into nothing by the heat of the seat warmers. The simple beauty almost brought tears to my eyes.

The driver's eyes stared back at me in the rearview, flashing with eagerness. “You’re riding in the T4 S-Class,” he continued…a chill sweeping through me. My eyes followed every feature, in order, highlighted with great enthusiasm by the man, and I could do nothing but merely blink. Blink in the hopes that everything would rinse away, that I would be back in the corner office with the drab walls, where nothing seemed to stop, but at least it all made sense.

The driver kept talking while I escaped into my phone. There was the Woodworth estate email. The board meeting request. Every word had been memorized to the punctuation marks. But there was a new notification that leaped forward on the screen. 

*Have you come to a decision?*

I lunged at the driver through the gap in the compartment. My body wedged into the gap, my hands wildly clawing at his back.

Always just out of reach.

“Mr. Mooney!” the man growled. “What has gotten into you? Get back, for God’s sake, sir. Please!”

 My fingertips slipped against the waxy twill of his coat. His chest lay flat against the steering wheel, his index finger placed firmly on the button. The swipes were futile, but the effort gave me a sad semblance of control.

The screen rose, the pressure constricting my midriff against the thick sheet of glass and the roof. It forced the air out of my lungs, my teeth gnashed and snarling. 

It kept rising, the car still moving. 

My head began to swim in flashes of dancing lights and stars. A fierce bolt of pain shot through my midsection as something cracked.

 “Sit back, Mr. Mooney,” the driver advised.  “We’ll be there, soon enough.”

\*\*\*

I awoke to a phone call sailing in from the front seat. 

Mr. Mooney’s eyes were bright and wide with a shimmer of that woeful, impending doom that he seemed to enjoy.

 They jumped playfully from the rearview and back to the darkness up ahead. 

The grin slowly came back to his face.

 “Nice nap, Mr. Mooney?”
