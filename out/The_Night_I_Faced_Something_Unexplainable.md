I never really believed in ghosts. I thought they were just stories, things people talked about to spook each other or get a laugh around a campfire. But after what happened to me, I’m not so sure anymore. I don’t think I’ll ever be the same.

It all started when I moved into this old apartment on the edge of town. I needed a place that was cheap and close to work, and this building fit the bill. It was old, maybe from the 1950s, with creaky wooden floors and peeling wallpaper, but it had character. The landlord seemed okay, and the rent was right. It felt like the perfect fit, a bit worn around the edges but livable.

The first week was quiet enough. I spent my evenings unpacking and getting used to the place. But then, things started getting weird. At first, it was little stuff: doors that I’d closed were slightly ajar in the morning, lights that flickered unpredictably, and a constant creaking from the floor above, even though I knew no one lived up there. It could have been nothing, just the quirks of an old building, but it started to get under my skin.

Then the noises began. It wasn’t just creaking anymore; it sounded like something heavy was being dragged across the floor above me. It started around midnight and continued until just before dawn. It was relentless, this dragging sound, like a giant burlap sack being dragged back and forth. I tried to ignore it, convincing myself it was just old building noises or maybe even rats in the walls, but the sounds were too rhythmic, too deliberate to be anything but unnerving.

One night, after a particularly restless evening, I decided to investigate. I was fed up with the noise, and I needed to find out what was going on. I grabbed a flashlight and headed up to the top floor, the creaky stairs echoing with each step. As I climbed, the air grew colder and colder, until I was shivering despite my hoodie. When I reached the top, the hallway was dimly lit by moonlight filtering through a grimy window. All the doors were closed, except for one at the end of the hall. It was slightly open, just a crack, and the darkness beyond it seemed unusually thick.

I felt a shiver run down my spine as I approached. My instincts screamed at me to turn back, but curiosity—or maybe just stubbornness—kept me going. I pushed the door open and shone my flashlight inside. The room was empty, with bare walls and a dusty floor, but the cold in there was suffocating. There was a smell too, faint but unmistakable, like rotting leaves or something decaying. I should have left then, but I felt compelled to step inside.

The moment I crossed the threshold, the door slammed shut behind me, making me jump. I spun around, but the door wouldn’t budge. I was trapped. The flashlight flickered and then went out, plunging me into darkness. I could hear that dragging noise again, but it was right next to me now, closer than before. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst.

Then I felt it. Something cold and heavy brushed against my arm, just for a second. It was enough to send my panic through the roof. I couldn’t see anything, but I could sense a presence, something oppressive and malevolent. I was frozen, my body paralyzed with fear, as the noise grew louder and more frantic. The cold seemed to seep into my bones, and I felt like I was being suffocated.

Just then, a voice, not really a voice but more of a whisper in my head, said one word: “Leave.” It wasn’t a voice you’d hear from a person. It was more like a hiss, a groan, a sound that sent a shiver down my spine. I didn’t wait. I bolted for the door, desperately trying to open it, and somehow, it finally gave way. I stumbled back into the hallway, barely able to catch my breath, and fled back to my apartment.

I don’t remember much after that. I was too shaken, too scared to think clearly. I spent the rest of the night in my living room, every light on, my eyes fixed on the door, waiting for something to happen. I must have eventually fallen asleep from sheer exhaustion, because when I woke up, the world felt different, heavier somehow. The noises stopped, but the fear didn’t.

The next morning, I woke up feeling like I’d been hit by a truck. My chest felt like it was on fire, and there was this horrible, rotting smell in the air. I looked down, and my heart nearly stopped. There were scratch marks on my chest, long and raw, like someone had used their nails to claw at me. They were fresh, and by the size and spacing of the scratches, it was clear that whatever had scratched me was human-sized. Fortunately, they weren’t deep, but they were enough to make me feel sick. The pain was burning, a constant reminder of what I’d encountered.

I packed up what I could and got out of that apartment as quickly as possible. I didn’t even bother telling the landlord—I just couldn’t face going back there. I moved in with a friend until I found a new place. I never told anyone the full story. I just said the apartment didn’t feel right and I needed to move. But the truth is, I’m still haunted by what happened. Even now, months later, I sometimes feel that cold, oppressive presence, like it’s waiting for me to slip up so it can come back.

The nightmares haven’t stopped. I still wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like something is watching me, waiting for me to be alone. I’ve learned that some stories are more than just stories, and once you’ve had an experience like that, it changes you. I don’t think I’ll ever be free of it, not really. And now, when someone starts telling a ghost story, I just listen in silence, because I know there are things out there that are far more real than anyone wants to admit.
