For the past few months, I have been hearing crawling on my roof and scratching under my bed. Food started going missing, and the trash can emptied out on the floor.At first my family and I believed we have another stray cat situation since this isn't the first time this happens, however that theory was quickly discarded when we found egg shells the size of my chest laying around in random dark corners. 

Now I'm a fairly tall person so seeing the shells made my skin crawl.Soon we started hearing the sound of skittering from large insect like creatures on the tile floor and by the sound of it whatever it was, was in a rush. I tried running to where I believe the sound to be coming from, but by the time I get their it was quiet, so quiet in fact that you get the feeling that something is seriously wrong. 

As a group we searched the house from top to bottom. The creatures were smart, only moving when we weren't close and taking little bits of food at a time. Occasionally we would hear insect chirps but it would echo so we couldn't tell where it was coming from. 

My dad getting restless he placed rat traps everywhere. We would hear the trap go off but with nothing inside it as if we were being taunnted. Until we heard a loud agonising screech shattering the kitchen windows. In the trap was... something unexplainable... it was the size of my brother and its head... it's head haunts my nightmares.

This was no insect, it had a face like it was a person but with the body of a cockroach... it had no eyes nor teeth but some how it saw me as I approach and its mouth unfolded revealing six mandibles and it screeched like a banshee making my ears bleed. I stomped on its head leaving black ooze all across the floor.

My mom, brother and sister rushed into the back yard while my dad and I was surrounded by dozens of these abominations as they appeared out of thin air. Quickly running out of energy we fended them off one by one until what seemed like the matriarch storming us from my room. It had the face of a woman but its body was as big as a door.

Stopping right infront of us almost sliding on the massacre of abominations it spoke in a voice that made a banshee sound like an opera singer. "Stop murdering my children!" My dad was out of breath so I replied "Leave our house you and your spawn are not welcome here !" It's expression was that of a child not getting its way and it tried to attack while screeching "My hive will feast on your remains!" 

As it charged at me I angled the shovel I was using as a weapon in such a way that the momentum of the matriarch would split it in half. Lucky for me, it worked perfectly. As the matriarch lay dead, the whole house shook as thousands of insects screeched in an ear, splitting harmony. Then there was nothing...

Took a pretty penny to repair the damage that was done and a full weak to clean every corner of the house, but there was no sign of the abominations. However, since then, I have the feeling of something watching my every move and that this wasn't the last time something unnatural happens to me...
