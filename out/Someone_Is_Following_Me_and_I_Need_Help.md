I’m going to try and find a spot in the woods that maybe has service so I can send this out to anybody who could potentially read it. I think I’m somewhere in western Pennsylvania at this point but I’m not entirely sure. Once this post goes through I’m going to try and make a call to the police to try and set up a search and rescue but I have to keep moving so I’m not sure how well it would work. 

My name is Trevor Adams and I was going into the Appliachian trail from where it starts in Springer Mountain in Georgia, hoping to complete the whole thing. I had gone on a hiatus from my job to live out my dream of hiking the whole trail on my own and at this point it’s starting to look like I should have listened to my damn mother and not gotten into my own head about needing to prove to myself that I could do some kind of famously difficult thing before I died. Now I think I might die in the next few hours.

Someone is following me and they’re not right. I wish that I could make this sound less stupid than it sounds, but I’ll start by telling you my experience from the beginning, so if I go missing and I can’t contact the authorities beforehand, my parents will know what happened. I’m walking as I type this. Apologies if it sounds rushed. I need to get this out as fast as I can. 

I pulled up at the entrance to the trail around 7:30 am. I had stayed in a hotel about a mile away the night before to check all of my gear and food supplies for the trip. I let my friends and family know that I was about to head in and parked and locked my car. The first few days were about what I expected them to be. Beautiful forest, nice people walking along the trail. Several of them wished me good luck when I told them I was out to do the whole trail on my own. A few recommended places to rest and gave their opinions on the rest stops and resupply points. The trees were gorgeous and the hills were steep. At the top of every one I was rewarded with more beautiful views and more opportunities to take pictures with my phone. 

I’m by no means a professional, but I thought I did pretty well with the ones I did take. I had packed 3 spare battery packs in my backpack just in case of emergencies, and now I’m so thankful that I thought ahead enough in that regard. 

Around the third day I was really feeling the exhaustion of the trail so I decided to set up camp a bit early. Typically I would have liked to find a designated camping site with other hikers, but I thought that a night choosing to disperse camp would be better for me then. I set up my small tent and got to relaxing. Around 8 pm the sun had begun to set and I was getting tired so I put my book back in my bag and crawled into my tent for a long night’s rest so I could feel refreshed for the morning. I checked the batteries in my lantern, and then crawled into my sleeping bag. 

When I woke up it was pitch dark and the sound of a night wind was slithering through the trees. I’m normally a deep sleeper so waking up in the middle of the night was an odd occurrence. I instinctively began to move and reach for my lantern but something told me to stop. It was a gut feeling, a sense of pure wrongness. I had never felt that way before in my life but it felt so deeply primal that I had absolutely no choice but to remain completely frozen where I was. It didn’t help that I had an overwhelming urge to go to the bathroom. I listened, and waited. At first it was only the wind, but then I heard a barely perceptible rustle of movement through the grass right next to my head separated only by the thin fabric of my tent. 

I’m not a small guy so typically I wasn’t afraid of most things, but it occurred to me then that whatever was on the other side of the tent couldn’t be a wild animal. Wild animals sniffed, rustled, even if they were being quiet there was some indication of the fact that it was an animal. But this thing had made a sound despite deliberately trying to be quiet. I stayed still as stone, waiting for whoever it was to move along but they didn’t. I stayed still so long that I was wondering if anything had actually been there at all, until the clouds that were covering the moon parted themselves and a shadow painted the side of my tent. 

It was hard to make sense of at first, because it was so low to the ground. Maybe it was a stick, or a branch that had fallen and rolled to a stop beside the tent and that’s what had woken me up. It made perfect sense. I started to sit up, but the thing twitched what appeared to be a head in response. I froze again. Then, I started to make it out. It was a person, on their belly in the grass, but holding themselves up by its hands and toes. Still as death. To hold yourself at that position for any length of time with just your hands, arms and your toes would be difficult, but the way this person’s shoulders seemed to collapse downward and the perceived ropeyness of the muscles in the limbs… 

I swallowed, throat dry with panic. Its head twitched again but unnaturally to the side this time. I heard a dull crack. Holding my breath, I continued to remain still as I possibly could while it listened. And then, it moved in a way I could only describe as a slow loping, towards the trees, remaining belly down on the ground the whole time. When I hadn’t seen any shadows move for a long time I gained the courage to move again. As I reached for one of my empty bottles to finally relieve myself, my mind raced at what the thing could have possibly been. I didn’t want to consider what it truly looked like so my brain started trying to rationalize any possible normal explanation. I’d rather delude myself than believe there was some kind of maniac crawling around in the Appalachian forest. It just wasn’t normal, it wasn’t right. I wanted to forget about the experience as soon as I possibly could, if I could at all. 

It’s safe to say that I set out the next morning feeling exhausted, and not a bit rested. 

I was beginning to pass fewer people the further into the forest I moved. I was incredibly thankful for interaction with others when I could get it and I happily stopped to chat when they seemed willing themselves. The deeper I moved into the trail though, I kept thinking I was seeing things. Through particularly dense patches of trees I thought I saw movement of something between the branches, high up. I stared once or twice and thankfully it turned out to just be birds but I wasn’t entirely sure. I decided that it would be best not to camp on my own anymore and would strictly keep to the designated camping areas and resupply points. 

Over and over my mind replayed the night that I saw them. And the more I thought about it the more I couldn’t accept the person on the ground to be a person at all. It LOOKED like a person, but no decent person moved like that, and I’m not sure if somebody’s body would even allow them to move like that, even after years of doing it to themselves. Either they would have had to have been moving like that since they were a child or they were something else. Something not right. 

I’m not one to completely disregard the odd things in life, but I lean more towards rational explanation. I’m always willing to say that unexplainable things exist in a world as big as ours, but unexplainable things are only unexplainable until we find a way to figure it out. Was I just supposed to accept that there was some kind of inexplicable human being in the forest of Appalachia that crawled on the ground like an animal? Was it a spirit of some kind? A manifestation of a curse laid deep within the earth from the hearts and minds of a much older people? 

I don’t know. I started thinking about the movie The Ritual a few times and had to completely push it out of my mind before I decided to turn around completely and quit the whole journey. I should have then, I know that now. 

When I made it to the next rest stop there were a few people camping there so I set up my tent farther away from the trees, close enough to others to be polite, and started a fire. Warm food usually helps everything in my experience and I felt much better after I ate. I went to bed early, taking comfort in the sound of distant conversation and good natured laughter, closing my eyes without a single thought of the thing in my mind. 

I now understand that what I experienced that night was a dream, but even now I’m not entirely sure that it was. I awoke to the sound of my name being whispered sharply at the foot of my sleeping bag and when I opened my eyes it was there. Staring. There was only the extremely dim light from the moon coming through the tent fabric but it was enough to provide a dull outline in the dark of the thing crouching inches from my feet. I remember my heart starting to pound and breathing rapidly through my nose as panic overcame me once again. I couldn’t see its face, but I saw the suggestion of wide, hollow eyes in the shadows. 

It was speaking. It was saying the names of everyone I had ever known. My parents, my little sister, my best friend, my best friend’s girlfriend, my co-workers, even my childhood best friend and the names of the people I had once known in middle school. Names I no longer remembered. Its voice sounded like the whisper of leaves over dry bark; a light and horrible thing, insistent but sharp. I don’t remember passing out, but I must have, because the next time I opened my eyes, I could hear the sound of other campers packing up their things to continue on down the trail. Cool, grey, dim light washed over everything in the tent and I tried to ignore the sight of the muddy footprints at the foot of my sleeping bag. 

What was at first an exciting and positive experience had turned into something much more terrible, and as I walked through the forest I no longer could recognize the beautiful landscape as being beautiful. All I saw were trees for the thing to hide behind, to watch me from. There were trees in all directions, growing out of the earth in different angles. Deep copses and spiralling visions of ferns, bushes, and briar patches. It continued on, and on. Every step I took I knew I was moving even farther away from people. I was in the middle of it all now, and if I went back I would be going back towards IT. For the next few nights I stopped as frequently as I could at rest stops and camping grounds, hoping that I was moving further away from its territory. If it even had territory. 

One of the nights I remember being approached by a friendly looking man and his dog as I sat with my back to the other campers, facing the woods. I was sure I looked halfway to a madman then, my stubble grown into a patchy beard and my eyes framed with dark bags indicating poor sleep. The stranger’s expression suggested he thought so too as I turned stiffly to acknowledge his greeting. 

“How is your hike going?” He asked me conversationally as his dog sniffed my hand that held the hot dog and bun I had just finished cooking. I managed a smile and tore off a piece to offer the dog to which he accepted with the voracious appetite only dogs seem to have. 

“It’s going well enough.” I said, aware that my appearance indicated that it wasn’t going well at all. 

“Are you attempting the whole trail?” He asked then, observing my face a little bit too much for my liking. 

“Yes sir.” I responded, nodding my head in the direction I came from, “Started from the entrance down in Georgia.” 

He let out a sharp exhale in surprise, “You’ve made it farther than most then!” 

We talked about our experiences hiking before and how he was still a little bit of a beginner, but his wife who had remained over by the campfire had been doing it all her life. He invited me to sit with him for a while and I accepted gladly, happy to be of decent company for the first time in days. And for the first time in a while, I didn’t look into the trees, searching for something that was looking back. 

As we talked into the evening hours, my new friend explained that he had hit his limit, and he and his wife were going to head back the way they came. 

“It’s an intense experience.” his wife had comforted him, patting his leg, “It’s a huge commitment to take.” 

I nodded in understanding, smiling sympathetically. He shrugged in slight embarrassment and scratched his cheek as he explained that he needed to work on his stamina training. They both were comfortable with the idea of attempting again maybe next year in the late spring. His wife told us both stories of how she would go hiking for hours in the local parks with her sisters when she was younger and how she would see all kinds of wildlife. She had loved it so much that it became her hobby. 

“It’s like a compulsion.” She spoke hurriedly, “I have always naturally felt drawn to nature, but lately-”

It occurred to me then to ask a question. I didn’t want to ruin the mood of the conversation which had been mostly, if not all, positive. But a part of my mind needed to be consoled in the potential fact that…

“Have you seen anything weird on your trips through the Appalachian trail?” I interrupted suddenly. They both fell immediately silent and looked at me with wide eyes. The dog pushed at my hand with his wet nose and I rubbed his soft head to comfort myself. 

“Well…” The wife said quietly, then trailed off. 

The man’s eyes flicked to the entrance of the camp and I swallowed deeply in regret. 

“I’ve seen some things.” She said in a hushed voice. The man’s leg began to bounce where he sat and he bent forward, knitting his fingers together and staring into the fire. An odd sort of conspiratorial silence fell over us, as if we were the only ones who knew of what lived, and crawled, through these woods. 

“Like what?” I pushed. 

She seemed uncomfortable, “It’s…not safe to talk about it here.” 

“So you’ve seen it?” 

The woman pressed her lips together and refused to meet my eyes. The man continued to stare into the fire. It was all the confirmation I needed. I slowly sat back into my chair and rubbed the coarse hair along my jaw as I thought of going back with them. Safety in numbers. Right? I brought up the idea nervously, and the two looked at each other briefly and then nodded in agreement. I felt much better then. 

That night I had no dreams, and slept peacefully knowing that the fear of being alone in this place would soon end with the company of experienced hikers. 

When I woke in the morning, I found them gone. They had left me a note next to my tent on a piece of what appeared to be sketchbook paper. In delicate, cursive handwriting the woman had written me a warning: 

Trevor, 

I’m so sorry that we couldn’t take you with us, but I need you to know why. The fact that you’ve seen what you think you’ve seen at all is enough for me to know that you’ve been marked. I need to protect myself and my husband, and bringing you with us would be putting us both at risk. What you have seen is something older than most of us alive and I desperately urge you to call for an emergency extraction immediately. It has no name, but it hunts. I know it exists, because it took my sister years ago, and it was coming for me. Now it’s been passed along to you. My life will be spared, but the price is steep. Please, get out of these woods as fast as you can.

I crumpled the note up and threw it over my shoulder. Enough was enough. I didn’t need a crazy woman telling me I was being followed by something supernatural. What I needed was to get the hell out of here. I would heed her warning about leaving, but I wasn’t going to let her tell me that I was being hunted by anything. It occurred to me then how stupid it was that I didn’t bring a gun with me for safety. I remembered battery packs, but not a gun? Stupid. Stupid. 

As I packed up my things I pulled out my map and compass and mapped a route to the nearest town by the trail. There I would be able to call for help if they had cell service, or if they had emergency services there. I wasn’t going to die for pride. Finishing the trail meant nothing when it came to my place in my family’s lives. There was absolutely no way I was going to risk that. 

I set off then, moving quickly along towards the nearest town. It was about six miles away, and I had plenty of time if I just stuck to the trails. The main rule of hiking is to never, ever leave the trails. Even if you think there’s a shortcut in a certain direction, don’t take it. The landscape of the forest looks so similar that you risk getting disoriented even a few feet from the path. Even if you think you have a great sense of direction, don’t leave the trail. Ever. 

You have to understand that I had no choice. 

Around two hours after I left the campsite I heard footsteps echoing behind my own. When I turned there was no one there. I kept walking, and the footsteps resumed. Against my better judgement, lack of sleep, and acute stress I whirled around and screamed an empty threat into the thick, chokingly close trees. Nothing but silence answered me and the knowledge that not even the insects were chirping in the grass. I began to jog up the trail, looking down at my compass periodically and not even bothering to look behind me anymore as the footsteps resumed in equal stride with mine. They were beside me, behind me, above me somehow. The tree branches rustled and I could detect the faintest movement of a long, white arm out of the corner of my eye.

As I’m writing this now I realized I need to rephrase what I wrote in the beginning. It isn’t that it’s ‘someone’ following me, it’s something. Usually you can feel a malicious intent from a person, an ill feeling or a gut presence of want of harm. I feel nothing from this creature; it only wants. It stalks, it watches. It seems to be biding its time. It’s certainly fast enough to overtake me but this seems to be it’s way. Following, shadowing, watching and waiting. The exhaustion is wearing on my mind and my body and I can’t move for much longer. Eventually I’m going to run out of food. My feet are ruined in my hiking boots and with every step my legs burn. I think I’m close to where I want to be. The compass is reading the right direction. The light is fading, but the sound of pursuit has never slowed. I’ve seen its face. It has empty, wide eye sockets, staring from tree tops, from behind bushes, around trees. Always at changing angles. How is it moving this fast? I don’t understand it. 

Maybe that girl was right…I just hope that I can find somewhere with data so I can send-
