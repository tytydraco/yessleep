Where to start, where to start? 

I could start with the cult or Capella or any of the other million horrible things that have gone wrong. But maybe I should introduce myself first.

Name's Sycamore. I'm twenty-five, and I've been twenty-five since 1952. 

The first thing people do when they find out how old I am- the ones who believe me- assume that since I was alive in the fifties, I must be a bigoted asshole. Actually, bigoted assholes are the kind of people who I hit with the nearest available object. I don't care who you are, if I'm in a bar with you and you start spewing racist, sexist, Nazi-ass BS, you're going home in a full-body cast. If not a damn hearse. 

Ah, but I'm getting off track. 

Let me take you back to where this hell started- the tiny town of Saker Keep, West Virginia, circa 1952. Population 250, and no longer exists on any map. Known for absolutely nothing but being this tiny town in the middle of nowhere. And Tusie Ann, but that is an entirely different story that would take too long to explain. 

Saker Keep consisted of five streets, a church, a tiny one-room schoolhouse, a gas station, a jail, a few stores, an apartment building, and about three dozen or so cute little houses, occupied by cute little nuclear families. There was exactly one African-American person in the whole damn town, who also happened to be gay, and as such he was paraded around as their progressive flaghead. "Look! We support homos and Black folk!" Y'know, if by "support," you mean "don't actively harass most of the time." They even let him eat at the "white people" counter. 

So, yeah, that's about the shape of things. A town of mostly bigots- although I'm sure they considered themselves very progressive for their time. Truth be told, I never understood racism. If God made us all, surely he made us all alike. 

Ah, I'm getting sidetracked again. But the Black gay guy is very important to this story, you see.

His name was Marion. Marion Bailey. 

Let me rant about him for a moment. Take the tallest, hottest Black guy you've ever seen. Now multiply that by the power of the sun. When I say he was fine, I mean he was so gorgeous that if he'd lived in present times, he'd've been named the hottest man alive. You do not get more gorgeous than Marion Bailey. 

It was a hot June day when me, Sheriff Harrison Redford, and Deputy Sheriff Beef Arlen rolled into Saker Keep. We'd been cooped up in a cop car all the way from New York. We were heading back down south to our jurisdiction, but it was getting late, so we pulled into the smallest motel I have ever been in. 

I was the first one out of the car when it stopped. I was still recovering from surgery, in quite a bit of pain, and nauseous from the long car ride. I almost took a tumble, but Beef caught me.

"Woah, Sycamore. Careful there." He said in his big, deep voice.

"Yeah, I got it, thanks." I grumbled. 

The first thing I did when we got in the motel room was flop down on one of the twin beds and shove a pillow over my chest. Redford carried in the cooler- minifridges weren't a thing back then, so we kept my medication in the cooler during road trips. 

"Is my chest going to feel like Satan stabbed me forever, or just until I pass out?" I grumbled.

Redford chuckled and lit up a cigarette. "The doc said the pain will go down in two weeks or so."

"I ain't waiting that long. What does that Yank know, anyway?" I grumbled. 

"Nothing, apparently, since he didn't notice that you forged five damn psychologist letters." Beef rumbled as he switched on the TV.

Redford raised an eyebrow. "Damn, *five?*" 

I shrugged, which caused me to wince. "I wasn't about to let him weasel his way out of treating me."

Redford chuckled and shook his head. "You know that's a crime, right?" 

I smiled. "So's homosexuality, but that doesn't stop you."

Redford snorted. "Touche."

"Oooh, are the lovebirds having a little spat?" Beef said teasingly.

"We are not together!" I said. "We're just friends!" 

"Friends who're necking." Beef muttered. I threw my pillow at him, and we all burst into laughter.

Yes, even in an era where being queer was societally scandalous and illegal, a couple of gay guys and their straight friend could laugh it up in a motel in the middle of nowhere. Community and allies have always been here and always will be. 

Our evening passed uneventfully. A little boring. 

And that's when midnight hit and everything went wrong forever.

A knock at the door. 

"Ugh. I'll get it." I grumbled.

Picture this: a 5'6 white dude, dressed in nothing but a pair of boxers and a bathrobe, opening the door to reveal a big Black man at least eighteen inches taller than him, in a pink shirt, with a scarf tied around his neck. A pink shirt! In the fifties! How was this man not dead?!

"Uh... Can I help you?" I said. 

He looked around nervously. "Yes, I believe you might be able to."

This, of course, was Marion Bailey. 

I woke up Beef and Redford, and a moment later, we were all sitting on the floor. Marion kept glancing at me with those melty caramel eyes and their long, gorgeous eyelashes. 

"I'm the janitor at the church," he began, "and lately, things have been... Less than satisfactory."

"What do you mean?" Redford put in. 

Marion hesitated.
"Well, the First Paragons of Mother Mary-"

"Hang on, the what? That's not a denomination I've ever heard of." I said, the hair on the back of my neck standing up. 

"No, you wouldn't have. Their only church is this one here." Marion replied.

Alarm bells. I must've looked awful, because Redford took my hand. 

"What're their policies?" I said.

"What?" Marion said, confused.

"Their policies! Their core beliefs, their rules, how they treat their congregation-" I said. Redford looked at Marion. "He's a cult escapee." He explained.

"Ah." Marion nodded. "No, they're... Well, they don't torture anyone or anything like that. They're no worse than any other Christians. I dunno if they're a cult or not, but they don't seem... Well, too odd."

"You're hesitant." Beef noted quietly. 

Redford leaned forward and gave Marion a smile. "Look, Mr. Bailey. You come knocking on the door in the middle of the night, asking three strangers for help, and you're being very skittish. Now, it don't take but a man with half a brain to notice something ain't right."

Marion sighed. "Okay, fine. It's the angel."

We all paused. Beef raised a massive eyebrow. "Angel? Like the statues they got in the courtyard in half the churches 'round here?"

Marion shook his head. "Not a statue. Trust me, I wish it was."

If my hair hadn't been standing up before, it was surely on end now. "No. You mean to tell us there's an actual genuine angel in that church?" I exclaimed.

"Yessir." Marion replied. He was unhappily looking at his folded hands. 

Redford fell silent. Beef snorted. "Yeah. Angel. Right."

I looked at Marion. "You're joking. Please, tell me you're joking."

Marion shook his head. "I really wish I was."

I must've been a sight to see, because Redford half-scooped me into a hug. "Calm down, Sycamore. Nothing's going to happen to you." 

Beef snorted again. "So what's wrong with the angel?"

Marion was very hesitant. "It's dead."

I was about to bolt. "Oh, so, so you're coming and asking for our help with... A dead angel? Some kind of divine cadaver? Great! Wonderful! Someone please shoot me and put me out of my misery." I laughed hysterically. 
 
Beef looked at me like I'd lost my mind. "Even if there's really a dead angel in the church, it can't be any worse than the bodies we've dealt with over the years. Just a person with wings."

I laughed. "Oh, you've never actually read the Bible, *have* you?" I said. 

Redford sighed. "He means that some angels in the Bible are described as... Burning wheels of eyes and crratures with the heads of lions and eagle wings and things like that."

Beef shrugged. "It's not one of those."

---

Reader, it was one of those.

The four of us stood in a tight circle on the church basement. Beef was staring, eyes bugged out. Marion's lips were pressed into a grim little line. Redford was tapping his foot nervously.

And I was jittering like an anxious caffeine addict with ADHD. 

Between the four of us was a creature the size of a horse, dressed in a robe made of what appeared to be layers of spiderweb, with six arms, four huge wings, the face of a bat, the body of a woman, and white rams' horns. It lay there limply, unmoving and unbreathing. 

"The hell happened to it?" Redford muttered.

Marion shook his head. "I dunno. I was cleaning upstairs and then I heard the loudest crash of my life. Next thing I knew, there was a holy corpse on the ground and a hole in the ceiling." 

I slowly knelt down next to the head of the dead angel and looked at its glossy, lifeless white eyes. Despite the adrenaline fueled terror running through my body, there was a lump in my throat. 

With a trembling hand, I pushed its eyelids closed. "We have to bury it."

Redford looked at me and nodded silently. 

Beef looked at the dead creature. "I don't understand. How the hell does an angel die? Aren't they supposed to be immortal?" He said.

Marion sighed, and for a second I almost forgot my fear. "It doesn't matter. We have to dig a grave."

I nodded. "I'll get a shovel."
"No, you won't." Redford stopped me. "You just had surgery, remember? The doctor said no lifting heavy things for two weeks. That includes shovelfuls of dirt."

I groaned loudly. "Damnit, Redford, I'm a grown ass man!"

Redford crossed his arms. "And I'm your boss, in case you forgot."

I rolled my eyes. "Ooh, forgive me, *Sheriff.* I forgot you were the king of the entire fucking world."

Beef snorted. "Sycamore, get your ass back to the motel before Redford decks you."

I grinned. "He'd never."

"I might." Redford responded.

Chuckling, I stood up. But a glance at the dead angel sent a wave of panicky sorrow through me again.

"At least let me help you carry it outside." I said. Redford was about to protest, but Beef stopped him. "No, let him." He said, rolling his thick arms. Beef knew that he was going to be doing moat of the heavy lifting and I was probably going to contribute nothing. 

"C'mon, I can carry it! Look, I'll even start right now!" I hooked my arms under the angel's midsection and lifted it. 

Something wet flopped out of its back and landed on the floor with a squelch. There was a moment where I stared at the giant, ragged, bloody hole in the angel's back with an expression of almost comedic surprise. 

Then I dropped the corpse, screamed, and took off. 

Sure, I'd seen corpses before. All part of the job. Mangled by dogs, mutilated in car accidents, made unrecognizable by twisted killers- occupational hazard of being a cop. But hooooly shit, I was not dealing with a divine cadaver. No thank you.

I was halfway to the stairs when I saw it.

There was a ripped leather messenger bag on the ground. At the foot of the staircase. Despite my initial terror, the odd placement of the bag stopped me. Where the hell had this come from?

I paused, picked up the bag, and turned. "Does this belong to our dearly departed mangled corpse?" I said, more shrilly than I liked.

Marion looked at me with those heartmelting eyes. "Uh... Probably? I've never seen it before."

I picked up the bag. And then I realized it was also bloody and dropped it. "Ahh! Ew, ew, ew!" I shrieked.

"How are you having this much trouble? Sycamore, really. You've seen blood before. A lot." Beef said as he manhandled the angelic corpse. 

"Well usually, the blood isn't from a *literal angel*!" I shrieked. "How are you *not* freaked out?!"

Beef shrugged. "I'm just pretending its any other crime scene."

Redford came over and put his arms around me. "I'll walk you back to the motel room, yeah?" He said soothingly. I nodded. 

It was a short walk back to the motel room, where he left me. Before he went, he gave me a kiss on the cheek. "We'll be back in a couple hours. Why don't you take a bath to calm down?" 

My hands opened and closed like I was squeezing the air. "I don't... Harry. Harry, I'm scared."

Redford smiled. "You'll be fine, Sycamore. You're a big, brave man. A big, strong police officer. Nothing's gonna hurt you. Promise."

I shivered and held him. "Okay. Okay."

With another kiss, he left. I watched him go, with those beautiful broad shoulders and chiseled jaw and those gorgeous red sideburns. God, he was spectacular.

Alone in the motel room, I fumbled through the drawer for Redford's cigarettes and lighter. I smoked one to calm myself down. Then another. Then six more. 

Yes, I have a problem. A lot of them, actually. 


Anyway, my brain kept coming back to that torn up messenger bag. Something... Something was nagging me. Some urge was telling me to open it. To see what was inside.

I spent an hour pacing, wrestling with my thoughts like Jacob with his angel, as I stared at the bag. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. 

Finally, I figured, what the hell.

Even as every rational sense I had, from my cop instincts to my primal reptile brain to just plain common sense screamed at me not to open the bag, that something was terribly wrong, I reached out. 

Opened the bag.

What was inside it was a scroll, about the length of ten regular sized pages. It was sealed. I unsealed it. I unfurled it. 

I read the top line. The title. The Tetragrammaton Apocryphon.

I read every line that came after that. 

I'm not even going to try to explain to you what was contained within that scroll. You wouldn't understand, anyway, even if I tried for a thousand years. 

Look, imagine the most beautiful poetry you've ever read, something so heartwrenching that it moves you to tears. Now imagine it was written by H.P. Lovecraft, with all his little nondescriptions and vagueness. 

No? 

Alright. 

Imagine that you are in the exact center of the universe for a moment, and you understand it's movements and machinations. Imagine that for a second, you fully comprehend and understand everything about everything, down to the tiniest subatomic particle. It's beautiful. It's terrifying. 

That's what reading the Tetragrammaton Apocryphon feels like. 

No? Still not enough for you?

Let me put it this way. In that exact moment, I understood exactly how Adam felt after he bit into the forbidden fruit. 

The Tetragrammaton Apocryphon is so beautiful, so terrible, and so utterly alien that I cannot explain it. I would say it describes reality as an observer from the outside, but that's a bastardized oversimplification. It's like having the best LSD trip and the worst LSD trip simultaneously. 

I will not utter a single line. What I read in that scroll is my burden and mine alone. You wouldn't understand any of it, anyway. 

Back to the story.

There I was, shaking and trembling. It felt like my mind had expanded a thousandfold. I was full of both boundless exhilaration and existential dread. 

And that's when I got the papercut.

My thumb slipped from all of the shaking. The paper's edge split my mortal flesh and spilt my blood. And I, like a fool, pressed my thumb to the paper to staunch the bleeding.

It was instantaneous. 

You know that feeling, when you get a cut dirty? One moment, it was that. In the span of a heartbeat, every vein, artery, and capillary in my body felt like it had been filled with boiling lava. Every damn nerve I had flared with pain. I screamed, fell to the ground. I shook. My sinuses boiled, my nose began to recede and flatten into a pair of long, hideous slits. My hair stood up on my head. The hairs, like magnets, stuck together, forming two bundles on my head. The keratin fused, melted, formed into two fin-like appendages. My face deformed and stretched, my jaw unhinging and my bones popping as they lengthened and reformed themselves. My gums receded and my teeth grew into jagged points. My eyes bugged with pressure, became larger and flatter, glowing an eerie amber. My bones stretched out, lengthening far beyond the limbs of normal humans. Each fingernail grew into a thick claw, each finger into an emaciated talon. My skin lost it's pigment entirely, becoming white as death. My spine was stretched to its limits. Every muscle was strained, tore, and reformed itself. Every tendon and every ligament shifted positions. My skin seemed to shrink to fit my new frame. 

It was utter agony.

When it ended, I was lying half-conscious on the floor, in terror and pain. 

Slowly, the pain ebbed. 

And all I felt was aching hunger. 

I don't remember what I did. All I remember is that I woke up to a horrified  Beef standing over me.

"What the *fuck,* Sycamore?" He whispered.

Dread and terror were etched throughout my entire body. I looked for a mirror.

Why was I in the church?

"Beef...? What... What happened?" I whispered. 

I looked down. Whatever had happened, I was a person again, and not the thing.

Wait.

Who's clothes was I wearing?

I didn't recognize the blue button-down I wore, or the brown cargo pants. 

Beef looked at me. "What did you *do?*" He whispered.

I was so confused. "I have no idea! Beef, I don't remember anything that happened last night!"

I took a step towards him, and he stepped back. 

That sent dread and fear, true fear, throughout my entire body. Because if Beef, Beef who had seen men gunned down in Germany, Beef who had pulled the woman who he'd marry, bald and emaciated, out of a cell in a death camp, Beef who'd been a police officer almost as long as I'd been alive, if *he* was scared of *me...*

*What the fuck had I done?*


I heard a groan nearby, and I turned. "Marion! Marion, what the hell.."

My words died in my throat as that sick since of dread twisted in my gut again. 

Marion's left arm, from the elbow down, was gone. It looked like a wild animal had gotten it between it's teeth and torn it off. There was only a shard of bone sticking out of that red meat.

That *delicious,* absolutely *perfect* red meat, mouthwatering, with just a little yellow fat, meat that would taste absolutely *divine* roasted till it falls apart on the fork, all tender and juicy, served with buttery loaded baked potatoes and creamy yellow macaroni and cheese, or ground up with garlic and pressed, cooked, and sat on a bun with pickles and ketchup, mustard and cheddar cheese, with deep-fried potato wedges and a nice frosty glass of root beer, or grilled to perfection, seasoned, sliced up, and stuffed in a tortilla with cheese and sour cream, beans and rice and guacamole, or cubed and boiled in broth, with carrots, potatoes, onion, served with buttery sourdough, or rolled into balls wkrh breadcrumbs and baked, then dunked in rich tomato sauce with spaghetti cooked just right and garnished with just a hint of basil and a lot of cheese, and a nice piece of garlic bread...

Sorry. Got off topic there. 

I tried to step towards Marion, but he scooted back. "G-Get the hell away from me... Oh god. Oh god, what are you?"

I was so confused. "I'm just me. I..."
I stepped in something. Something meaty.

I looked down.

It's been years since that day. Marion recovered well from the loss of his arm. Went on to become a teacher. Ended up getting together with a nice lumberjack and spending the rest of their lives together in the countryside- which was another thirty years. They both died from AIDS. But I hear those thirty years were full of love and laughter, and a girl who spent more time at their house than she did at her home. She's in her sixties now, but she recalls them fondly. Says they raised her more than her own mom did. 

As for Beef, he went on to become the Sheriff back in our jurisdiction. We maintained a cordiality, since we had to work together, but I left the force in 1957. I've worked for other forces since then. Among other things. He had a kid, Abram. Abram went on to be a police officer, and his son, and his son, and his daughter. Five generations of police officers. Let me tell you, when I hear "All Cops Are Bastards," I think of the Arlen family. They're always the exception to that rule. Anyway, Beef died in 1997. He was in his eighties. 

As for me?

I live in fear.

Yes, it gets better from time to time. I do have kids. And grandkids. I don't always see them, but... Well, I have a family. A web of connections, who always have my back.    

But it's meaningless. I'll outlive them all. I learned that when I went back to the motel room. I saw my lavender hair and amber eyes, once brown and hazel. I broke the mirror. I took a shard of glass.

That was the first time, it wasn't the last. Many times I've tried. It doesn't matter. Whatever damage I take, my body repairs itself. I've been burnt to ashes and scattered across the world, sliced into pieces, drowned, shot, stabbed, pushed off a roof and out of a plane, vivisected, electrocuted, beaten to death, frozen, thrown in a woodchipper, run over, blown up, I've even had my very atoms torn apart. It doesn't matter. My body will regenerate, sooner or later.

And the entire time, I am fully conscious and fully lucid. I can't pass out. I can't even lose my mind, no matter how much physical pain or psychological damage I take.

For the past seventy-two years, I have been facing the same fear, the same terror, that I did when I looked down and saw the mangled corpse of Harrison Redford, face eaten to the bone. 

I cannot die. 

*No matter how much I want to.*
