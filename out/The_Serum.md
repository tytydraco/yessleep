 I awaken to find myself in a room, scanning my surroundings brings me only more questions
the one stomping around my mind the most is

“where am I?”

I try to stand in the lit empty room to find my legs feeling less alive then usual
“Guess I’ve been out for awhile”

 Wondering the room I can’t help but to start to panic as my mind realizes what situation I am in
As I think about the pros and cons of calling out to see what’s going on a older voice speaks from an intercom 
“Micheal” the mystery man says in a melodic tone
“Get up Micheal, you got debts to pay”

“Debts” I wonder to myself
“who are you, what is this” I scream out 

right then a portion of the wall forms into a door 
Puzzled I step towards the door
Knowing whatever’s out there would have to be faced eventually I slowly open the mystery door to a dimly lit hallway with with one door to the left and one to the right.

After fighting with myself I choose the left door, slowly creaking it open I see not much but green and purple stripped wallpaper, pushing the rest of the door open reveals a room similar to the one I woke up in besides the wallpaper and the oldish plastic wrapped furniture 

Stepping into the room I look around for anything useful or out of place before sitting down when the floor opens up underneath me faster then I could process what’s going on 
After falling and screaming for what seemed like hours but was probably only minutes I hit something soft although it still knocked the wind out of me 
“.Watch your step” the mystery man says with an odd cackle then adding on “come forth and take the trial”

Picking myself up all I see is the mattress I fell on and a door, on the door theres a sign saying
“be bold and fearless or suffer and perish”
“Cheesy” I say more to myself then out loud 
Thinking at this point I have no choice I brace myself and open the door and see what looks like a forest as far as I can see, no roof,no walls, nothing to show that it’s still inside the building, stepping through I turn to see the door I came through now gone.

More confused then I’d say any person has ever been I walk forward before hearing that familiar booming voice
 “survive for 10 minutes to win the game, understand?” 
But before I could even comprehend that I stepped through a now non existing door onto a rain forest I hear 
“good, time starts now!”
Confused I look around not seeing anything until I hear a crashing coming from my right, turning I see trees being swung left to right as something hidden behind rushes towards me

Screaming I turn and run for my life before seeing a tree with thick vines going down the side, grabbing one I hurriedly start pulling myself up the vine, once I’m about 13 feet of the ground the creature now roaring like a lion send a tree barreling across the ground before stepping into sight.

Horrified I see what could only be described as a gorilla/spider hybrid, it had 3 humongous ripped arms that hung on each side, with a sickly looking row of teeth looking like they belong more to a piranha then ape, covered in ripped blood stained black fur

When it reaches up and grabs me accepting my fate I hear one last cackle before everything slowly fades to black

“MICHEAL!”
A women in a lab coat with 3 arrows yells next to me 
“Micheal what happened, what did you see?”
After coming to the realization it wasn’t real and catching my breath
“The SCP is a fear serum I stutter” 
She looks at me with this look that seemed like joy?
If someone could feel joy after realizing they discovered an unnatural and inhumane fear serum
“Good now describe the events back to me, as clear as possible” she says pulling out a recording device 
“Sighing, I wish I never got pulled for d class”
