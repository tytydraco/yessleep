The rifle scope glinted in the moonlight, a cold, glittering eye against the velvety darkness. My finger jerked on the trigger, adrenaline rushing through my veins. This was the end of it. The last shot. The one which would put an end to it all.  
  
I'd seen the reports, the security footage. Shots fired, and the man moved in a way that defied all logic, leaving a trail of bewildered assassins in his wake. He shouldn't have been anything specialâ€”just a regular guy, living a regular life. But then again, who wants a simple man dead?  
  
My employer called him a glitch in the matrix. I preferred "a pain in the ass". Our firm had seen the best try and fail. Professionals, veterans, and even someone rumored to be ex-special forces. All returned empty-handed, their bullets lying where the man's body should've been.  
  
But I? I was different I wasn't just good, I was meticulous. I spent months studying him, analyzing his every move, and predicting his unpredictable movements. I knew his entire routine, the barista he'd try to hit on every other day, even his preferred underwear brand.  
  
Tonight, was the night. He was alone, predictable, a sitting duck. I had the high ground, the element of surprise. This time, he wouldn't escape. This time, he wouldn't be able to dodge.  
  
I lined up the shot. No red dot on his back. I didn't want to take any chances. I didn't need to. My heart hammered in my chest, not out of fear, but out of an odd mix of thrill and macabre intrigue. It was more than just a job; it was a test. A puzzle, begging to be solved.  
  
And then, with a single breath, I squeezed the trigger.  
  
The bullet cut through the air. A silent predator darting towards its prey. The bullet connected and blood flew out of his back. That's when I saw it. I couldn't believe my eyes. What followed distorted my mind as for the first time in my life, I'd seen a man survive my killing shot.  
  
He moved.  
  
An invisible shift. A blur. He, no it moved. Its eyes met mine through the scope. I was covered by the shadows. I froze, the rifle slipping from my grasp. My mind raced, trying to comprehend what I had just witnessed. Was it a trick? A hallucination?  
  
It didn't attack, didn't even speak. It simply tilted his head, a silent question hanging in the air. It was like a child, looking at an adult in confusion.  
  
I stood there, motionless, the sheer weight of the situation stunned me. I had aimed at a man, but what I shot was not human. I had encountered a mystery.  
  
It laughed.  
  
Then, my rifle's magazine fell out by itself as that thing turned and walked away, disappearing into the night as a phantom. I stood there, motionless. The story of the man who dodged bullets was just the beginning. And I, the mercenary was about to become an unwilling participant.
