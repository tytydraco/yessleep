"You see that's why I want you to Investigate that town. "the mother with that worried mother type face said. "You make a fair point Marie, ok I will have a look." "Thank you Andrew oh my god thank you, how much do I need to pay. "Marie said flipping through her purse. "It's fine Marie, don't pay me."

"Why though?" "Finding your daughter matters more then me." I say and trust me I mean it. "Oh Andrew thank you. "Marie says crying. But all I can do is hug her tight. Marie has a teenage daughter. Last week her and her friends went on a trip to the woods. Later that night she went missing .The closet place near them was a small woodsy town.

The next day I woke up at 4:00 am ,got in my car and drove into a dirt path in the woods. I drove and drove and drove all day. Once I got to the town with no name I found out there where no roads. I decided to park near the woods. I got out with my notebook and umbrella due to the rain poring down the a stampede. I walk up the the first person I see...a couple or siblings. I couldn't tell. "Hello you 2." I say "umm Hi." the girl says.

"I'm a detective and a girl went missing around here, so I'm just looking around. "I say trying to calm them down since they both looked very worried, as if I caught them doing something."Ohhhh." the girl  says. She then turns to the boy next to her and starts to doing sign language. "Sorry my brothers deaf." "No problem, it's not yours or your brothers fault." And then silence. "Well if you want to talk to someone about that talk to our mayor." "Where's he?" The girl thought for a second and then replied with "Most likely up there in the garden." she says pointing to her left. I start to walk to the garden.

This is...not a town, it's more of a village. They do have buildings but there more spread out. Once I got to the garden, I saw only one man working his ass off in the garden. "Hey are you the mayor?" I say. An old man slowly turns around and says "That would be me." "Hello umm a young lady went missing around here and I was wondering if I could stay here for a while." "Oh sure be my guess but just where are you staying?" "Just in my car, it's parked at the edge of the woods." "Okay then...you can stay." he said sounding a bit hesitant. "Thank you, very appreciated." I start to walk to my car when I hear the mayor yell. "hope you find her!" "Me too!" I yell back.

Walking to my car though was strange...every time I saw someone they where frightened of me, as if I caught them doing a crime. some even ran away. I don't know what the hell is happening here...but all I know is that they had something to do with that girls disappearance.
