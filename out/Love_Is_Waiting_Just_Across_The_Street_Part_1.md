My family was going on vacation for a few months so when they called me to look after the house I agreed, but I’m starting to wish I hadn’t.

I woke up one night around 12-1 AM feeling like the inside of a volcano and covered in sweat. The tv and the fan In my room were both off which was unusual (I never went to sleep with the tv off) but in my waking stupor I realized the power must have turned off. This also wasn’t unusual because the house was pretty old and the breaker tended to switch the power off pretty frequently so I knew I was going to have to go turn it back on. Now you might have guessed with it being a breaker it was outside which meant I had to go outside to manually switch the power back on.

Because the power was off and it was the dead of night the only life that came through the windows were the dancing rays of moonlight. Now I was afraid of the dark so I decided to grab my phone that was next to me in bed, turn on the flashlight and stumble down the darkness of the hallway where the moonlight didn’t reach. When I got to the front door I grabbed the key for the breaker off the wall and put on my shoes, then I headed outside and around the other side of the house to where the breaker was. 

This is where things started getting really bad though because when I approached the breaker I noticed the lock was gone and the door was slightly opened. When I saw this I nearly melted into the dirt but I quickly put it behind me as I remembered my family told me the power went out a lot so I thought maybe one of them just forgot to put the lock back on. When I opened the door to the breaker I noticed about ten switches and I didn’t know which one to flip so I kinda just looked around for which one looked off.

While I was doing this though, out of the corner of my eye I noticed someone across the street. I couldn’t make out if they were a man or a woman but they were in dark clothes and they were sitting on a bench smoking a cigarette. I didn’t think too much about this though as I was focused on this damn breaker but I finally found the right switch and flipped the power back on. When I glanced over at the figure across the street their eyes were completely fixated on me like they were watching my every move, they had their hands on their knees and were completely leaned forward as if trying to get a better look at me. This terrified me but still not being able to completely make out the figure across the street I just hurried back into the house without a word and locked the doors as fast as I could.

Not knowing if what I just saw was real, or not wanting to accept it, I tried to shake the feeling of terror, and headed back to bed. That didn’t last long though because while scrolling through YouTube for a few minutes I heard a knock at the door and with each knock I felt dread hit me harder into the ground. Not knowing what to do I crept down the hallway back to the front door and tried to get a look at whoever was at the front door through the curtains. I stopped myself from opening the curtains though because through them I saw a silhouette of a face and hands trying to peer through the window to which I started panicking and getting teary eyed but I knew I had to keep quiet.

I tried reaching for my phone in my pocket but I realized I had left it in my room when I came back inside but I was so scared at this point I couldn't move. Then I heard another knock and a voice, “Eve… Evelyn.” It was a man’s voice and his demeanor was calm and familiar as if had talked to me before. That was my name! How did he know my name! I started to cry even harder. Then he said, “Evelyn, do you believe in love at first sight, that your true love can be just across the street.”

“Because I do Evelyn, I love you Evelyn.”

I was in complete and utter horror at this point but the last thing I remember him say was, “I know you’re In there Evelyn, I know you’re awake.” This time his voice raised with anger, and in that moment I knew it was anger I didn’t reply to him. After a minute of nature's silence and mine, I heard his shoes crunch the dirt into the midnight.

After I sat on the floor hysterically crying for thirty minutes I finally texted my family but I got no response as it was around 2:00 AM at this point. Reluctantly I eventually fell asleep after I couldn’t stay awake anymore.

That was yesterday I’ve also told my best friend Riley and she said she’s coming over on Friday after school. So in the meantime I’m starting a Reddit post to make myself feel better and hopefully get other thoughts on the situation. What should I do? I will update this post after Riley comes over.
