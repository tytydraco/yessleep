I hadn’t slept in three days. Not a wink. At first, it was just a few restless nights, too much on my mind. But now, as the shadows stretched longer and the days blurred together, I felt my mind slowly unravelling.

I was staying at my uncle’s cabin up north, far from the city. He’d gone out for a few days, leaving me alone with nothing but the rustling of trees and the occasional howl of wolves. It was peaceful at first, a welcome change from the constant buzz of city life. But then, something shifted.

It started on the second night. I woke to the sound of footsteps outside the cabin, slow, deliberate, and too heavy for the wind. My heart pounded as I listened, straining my ears to hear if it was just my imagination. I grabbed a flashlight and crept toward the window, careful not to make a sound. What I saw made my blood run cold.

In the clearing just outside the cabin, a figure stood under the dim moonlight. At first, I thought it was a person, but as my eyes adjusted, I realized it wasn’t quite right. The figure was too tall, too hunched. The shadows seemed to cling to it unnaturally, like the thing was part of the darkness itself. Its head was oddly shaped, too large for a human, and its eyes glowed faintly, like burning embers.

I froze, my breath caught in my throat. It moved toward the cabin, its steps unnervingly deliberate. I bolted back from the window, heart racing, but the cabin was silent again. Too silent. I had to get out. But when I grabbed my phone, the screen flickered and died. No signal.

Panic set in. I knew I was alone, but that thing outside didn’t feel human. My mind raced, trying to make sense of it. The stories my uncle used to tell me about skinwalkers, about creatures that could wear the skin of animals, or even people, came rushing back to me. I’d always dismissed them as folklore, something to scare kids around the campfire. But now, with my pulse pounding in my ears, I wasn’t so sure.

The thing outside circled the cabin. The sounds of it scraping against the walls and scratching at the door kept me wide awake, each second more unbearable than the last. I couldn’t tell if it was real or if my lack of sleep was playing tricks on me. My vision blurred, and the edges of reality began to fray. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw it again, closer, its grotesque face looming just outside my thoughts.

By morning, I was a shell of myself, nauseous, dizzy, my hands shaking. I hadn’t slept at all, and the world around me felt wrong. My uncle’s truck was still missing, meaning he hadn’t come back yet. I was alone in the cabin, except for… the thing.

I thought I saw it again that afternoon, standing just outside the treeline, watching me. It was crouched down now, more animal than human. But something about it, the way it moved, the way it lingered, told me it was waiting for the right moment to strike. I had to leave, but with no vehicle and no phone signal, I was trapped.

The hours stretched on. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. It wasn’t just outside anymore. The air in the cabin felt heavy, oppressive. I couldn’t escape the sense that something was inside with me. I heard scraping sounds on the walls again, but this time they came from the inside. I turned, and there, standing at the door, was a figure I knew all too well...my uncle.

But it wasn’t him.

His eyes were dark pools, his face gaunt and stretched, his mouth twisted into a grin that was too wide, too sharp. And then I heard it: the sound of bones cracking, flesh tearing. The thing’s skin shifted, the texture changing, until it was wearing my uncle’s face like a mask.

“Sleep, child,” it whispered, its voice a horrible mockery of the man I once knew.

I ran. I don’t know how long I’ve been running now, days, maybe weeks. The sun never seems to rise, and the thing is still with me, wearing a thousand faces, trying to catch me. I don’t know if I’m awake anymore or if I’ve fallen into some terrible nightmare from which I’ll never wake up. But I know this: I haven’t slept. And I never will again.
