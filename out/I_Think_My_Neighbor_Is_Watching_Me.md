Okay, Reddit, I have to get this out because it's getting under my skin, and I do not know who else to tell. I moved into this small apartment a few months ago, excited to finally have my own place. It is a nice neighborhood, quiet and safe, or so I thought.

The trouble started about a month in. I'd been coming home late a lot, thanks to a new project at work, and I guess I'm a creature of habit. Every night, I'd unlock my door, toss my bag on the couch, and go straight for the fridge for a snack. One night, I got this weird feeling that someone was watching me. I laughed it off, but as I stood there, that uneasiness wouldn't go away.

I have this big sliding glass door that goes out to a tiny balcony. It's supposed to give you this nice view of the complex courtyard, but that night, it only made me feel exposed. I could almost swear that somebody was standing in the dark, out there, staring at me through the glass.

The next night, same routine, same creepy feeling. So I thought, all right, I'm going to be smart about this. I turned all the lights off and just stood there by the glass, waiting for somebody, anybody, to move out there. Nothing. Just my imagination, right? I almost laughed out loud at myself for being paranoid.

  
But then… maybe two weeks ago, I started noticing weird things in my apartment. Just little stuff that was out of place. A few photos on the wall were crooked. My toothbrush was damp even though I hadn't used it. A couple of drawers were open when I distinctly remembered closing them.

  
I thought, maybe I was just stressed, forgetting things, whatever. But then, one morning, I wake up and my kitchen counter had a cup on it. Full of water. And it wasn't mine. Now, that sounds stupid, I know, but I am a coffee drinker. I don't even own a cup like this. It was plain, clear, like a glass you'd find at a bar, and I've never seen it in my life.

The cup thing freaked me out enough that I went to the front office, trying to sound casual, and asked the guy at the desk if I could review the tapes from the past few nights. He gave me this look, like he wanted to know why, but just nodded and led me to the back room.

We pulled up the footage for my floor. I was watching, expecting nothing. Maybe some random maintenance guy would walk by or something. But then, there was this man, he was just standing outside my door. He'd stand there for a few minutes at a time, occasionally with his head cocked to one side, as though he were trying to hear something.

It gets worse. I keep watching, horrified, as he reaches up, pulls a key from his pocket, unlocks my door, and slips inside. I sat there, frozen, my whole room suddenly too hot, too small. This wasn't some maintenance guy; it was my neighbor. The man I had seen so many times before, always courteous, always affable, who would acknowledge me in the hallway with a nod and say "hi" as if we were just two ordinary people.

I tried to keep watching, but I couldn't. My brain was just looping through memories of him, the times he'd helped me with my groceries, held the door open, always so damn nice. How many times had he been in my apartment without me knowing?

  
I confronted him, or at least I tried. I stood outside his door shaking, rehearsing what I'd say. But when he opened it, he just looked at me with that blank smile, like he knew exactly what I was going to say and didn't care. So I ended up mumbling some sort of incoherence and backing away. He didn't say a word, just watched me leave.

It was stupid, but what else could I say? Stop watching me? I've decided to go ahead and move now, starting in a few weeks. But now I'm afraid he might, somehow follow me.
