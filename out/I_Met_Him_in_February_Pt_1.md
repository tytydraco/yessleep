This isn’t a campfire ghost story. A fabrication. Everything here is 100% true. I just want to emphasise that. It’s inevitable I share this, since I cannot share almost any of this with the few people I know. I've even made a throwaway reddit account to so this can't be traced back to me in any way at all. If the veil of anonymity the internet offers is best for one thing, it’s building a chasm for you to just scream your frustrations into. If you let feelings and thoughts and memories so visceral fester and build up, you’ll die. They’ll cannibalise you whole; you’ll be dead before you even knew you were alive. I’m writing this for *myself* and *myself* alone, in what’ll ultimately be a misguided attempt to cleanse my consciousness, which I’ll probably regret. I want to apologise if anybody else is reading this – this is lengthy and the unabridged recount of this story. I’ve never written before, so there’s the very real chance this is just incomprehensible.

When you see people discuss being socially maladjusted, normally it’s in reference to some kind of trauma. Some kind of disadvantaged position socially or financially, a parent using your infant head as an ashtray, a medical condition or two – but it’s almost as sad, and a lot more pathetic, when it’s just the way you are. My whole life, I’ve been shy, withdrawn, never understood or gotten along with people. I was, as a little girl, virtually friendless, and achingly lonely. Even now, in my contemplative mind set, I wouldn’t be able to tell you which came first, the depression or the anxiety, but eventually they had conjoined into some Siamese twin chasing it’s other half, an ouroboros just in perennial devour. Without going into specifics, that shit hit me *hard*. Self-harm, suicidal ideation, almost psychotic episodes of derealisation - it became unmanageable to hide.

My parents are an interesting couple – long-married, though I think sometimes it’d have been better for them both if they had thrown in the towel a while back. Middle-class, though that’s very relative, and fiercely catholic. My mum and I weren’t unclose, though I couldn’t speak to her even if I needed to, and my father was an emotionally absent alcoholic. I was an only, and very late, child.

Try as I might, my internal struggle inevitably spilled out, and they decided, after scrounging up and divesting what loose finances they could, they’d send me to a Catholic boarding school far away from home. I think it was their way of saying they cared, a normal human gesture of compassion refracted and warped through years of religious dogma as if it were some fun-house mirror. Contrary to how I was raised, I’m not a Christian, I’m not a Catholic - and try as I might, and I absolutely *did*, I didn’t have much say in the whole matter. I barely had much stake honestly, it wasn’t like I was abandoning some vivid and flourishing life.

The school was exactly as you’d expect and nothing more. An olden-times, borderline-derelict chapel crudely integrated into a big, Victorian-era brick school building. There were some much smaller and clunky, industrial-looking concrete buildings, studded in cheap gravel, and nothing else in a million-mile radius, unless you count forest and fields and the occasional sheep. The facilities were decently equipped. Ignoring the occasional religious piousness, the staff and teachers were nice. The lessons were survivable. The dorm rooms were acceptably sized, though horribly plain, and always never quite warm enough. I remember sitting down on the bed for the first time, and locking glares with the crucifix opposite me. His weary, pained expression, his drooping eyes, his stooping neck, his rippling muscles tensing across every grain of lacquered wood. As off-putting as it was, you couldn’t deny the craftsmanship.

Initially, I didn’t have friends. I just counted time, haunting the labyrinthine hallways like some wayward, listless cartographer. You’d never expect a building so square to be so impossible to navigate. Corridors would lead to doors which would lead to more corridors which would lead to dead ends. In the early morning, or the evening, the windows would cast the red bricks and dark wood boards with an amber hue, which’d make them warm to the touch. When I was out of sight, I’d lie against them, and just feel the sun on my face and the warm on my back. Sun always feels the warmest when it’s rising up after the night or sinking down to make way for the moon. Nobody really spoke to me, and I was, essentially, completely alone. My life was ascetic, and solitude was my default state. I was expecting these two years to pass quickly.

For someone so pivotal, meeting Emma was incredibly mundane. We just got paired up in class. You tend to never notice it, but the most important relationships tend to be born from convenience and obligation. It didn’t take long for us to hit it off, though. For two drastically different people, she and I shared so much in common. We liked the same movies, the same video games, and the same music. We made each other playlists of indie rock and folk songs, shared hip-hop music videos. We’d send each other texts and memes and paper notes in class. We’d eat lunch together. She laughed at my jokes, and told me I was the funniest person she knew. She was lying, of course. She accepted me for being different, and occasionally difficult. She was kind.

Sometimes, we’d talk over the custom messaging software the school employed. Picture Microsoft Teams, by way of AOL. It was a relic of a bygone era, amateurishly built and easy to exploit. Tabs and menus were a watery green - it was, honestly, impressively gross. We’d say the crassest things we could, knowing we were being spied on, for the thrill of pushing the boundary, the high of flying too near the sun. Every account was tied to a school email, displaying student and staff names, though that wasn’t tough to change if you tried.

--- --- --- --- ---

Out of all the months at the school, February was especially cold. The floorboards would settle like they were bearing the weight of footsteps, trepidatiously testing for creaks as to go unnoticed. Damp would clot in the corners of the tall classrooms; it was worth layering over your uniform. One day, I got a message from a new contact on the shitty SMS, which was new for me, since I didn’t really speak to anyone outside of a single person. I barely even called or texted my parents. They didn’t have a profile picture, just the default green back with the first letter of their display name - in their case *B*, for *BluFebruary15*. I asked him who he was, what he was doing:

*BluFebruary15: Killing time. I’m very bored.*

*You: Are you someone I know lol?*

*BluFebruary15: Not yet.*

Automatically, I had met the most interesting person in school.

If you’ve ever had rusty social skills or you struggle with meeting people, you’ll know it can be very hard to know what to say when you’re not forced to talk with someone. Conversations become some herculean effort, with you micromanaging how transactional your input is, how many questions you’re asking, getting paranoid over talking about yourself too much despite it being your only frame of reference. Being desperate to not say the wrong thing. When talking to *BluFeb*, though, it came naturally. They were a male student, he had friends, but he wasn’t immensely popular. He struck up several conversations with people on his anonymous account, but found they weren’t too interesting. He had caught wind that the school didn’t actually admin the software.

*You: So was I just some random choice then*

*BluFebruary15: No, your friend Emma told me about you.*

This came as a shock to me, since she never mentioned this guy. From this point on, whenever I’d press her about him, she’d just coyly shrug it off or joke that I was delusional. For a little window, I actually assumed that it was somehow her, as part of some elaborate joke, which made much more sense than the possibility I was genuinely this interesting to a total stranger. That was, until one time, when she admitted that she spoke to him too, though I could tell there was a bit of hurt on her end for some reason, so I figured to leave it unmentioned.

It wasn’t long after we started talking, though, that I gained confidence. I’d dump him huge walls of text about whatever movie I had just seen or album I just listened to, and he’d read it and respond and engage with it, and share his thoughts and feelings and tastes, and it just so happened they often aligned with my own - like he was mining my brain. He’d listen to me rant and rave and in turn, he’d always find something incredibly trivial to bitch about with vitriol – it was like we were soulmates. He always typed in full sentences, with perfect grammar and punctuation. Sometimes, he’d occasionally refer to himself in the third person. Honestly, I just assumed he was on the spectrum or something, though *glass houses* and all. We’d gossip about our classmates, as removed from them as we were, and our teachers – basically anyone or anything we could. Eventually, we’d discuss ourselves.

I’d tell him about my home life, how I imagined my parents sat at that table eating dinner, alone, in silence, and how, in my mind, it seemed even bigger than it did when I was little. Watching my dad come home as a kid and watching him slur and sputter and fall asleep lying on the floor. Watching my mum sat vacantly gazing into space, her eyes glazed with this non-descript sadness. It was an unknowable sadness, but I always read it as grief over a life unlived. That was probably projection, though. I’d share the time a kid pissed in my water bottle in school and got me to drink it. I told him about me falling out the open back of a truck and breaking my wrist when I was 9. Anything and everything I could, I would share. He’d reciprocate with something personal to him, but *just* vague enough it wouldn’t clue me into his identity. I’d just bleed my secrets like a sieve.

He’d never reveal who he was, no matter how hard I’d try to trick him into slipping up, or try to goad him to let loose some defining physical trait. He’d normally play it off as a joke – he *was* quite funny in that awkward, stilted way. Other times, he’d just be direct:

*BluFebruary15: This just loses the magic that way.*

He was probably right.

--- --- --- --- ---

Over the rest of the school year, nothing particularly changed. People’s emotional response to me was, at best, total apathy, and at worse, genuine dislike. I tried my best, though it never seemed to work. I did perfectly acceptable academically, landing just under the radar of attention from anyone. Life was ok in the day-to-day, but achingly uneventful. Someone got busted having sex in the toilets, *allegedly*. It was in the main one by reception, with the stained glass window. *Allegedly*. No idea who it was, though I’m sure Jesus was disappointed. Either that, or he had a great view.

More noteworthy, a student had tried to kill themselves. It was off campus, in the nearest town some ways away, of which they were a resident. Nothing to do with the school apparently, though admittedly I had zero knowledge of what actually happened. Rumour said the police found some *really* scary, fucked up things in her dorm room, though at the time, that seemed a little unlikely. All we knew is that she didn’t return, and they held an assembly for mental health awareness. I remember sat with Em at lunch, speculating what happened on the phone with her parents (we ended up talking quite a bit). They seemed so worried. The general consensus we all agreed on was some kind of mental breakdown. Something life-altering, yet something totally mundane.

--- --- --- --- ---

Once the next school year had started, Em and I established a little ritual. We would watch movies and shows, sat on her floor, or nestled against the wall on her bed next to each other, any chance we could. She had a shitty little TV in her room, though we’d usually use her laptop. We’d watch anything, and everything. I remember watching all of *Twin Peaks: The Return* with her, and she gave me a little episode guide she hand-wrote and illustrated for the original two seasons, for my own viewing (though, I’ll admit, I only got around to those this last year). We watched all of *Hannibal* twice.

I had never smoked, but she had one of those strong incense jars in her room to hide the smell at least a little. I remember sitting on the floor one night, very stoned, both of us splayed and sprawled in the most uncomfortable shapes. She sat propped up against her bed in this diagonal half-slump; I felt her toes fold and dig into my stomach. I remember looking up into her brown eyes – they were just these starry pools of cosmic, unbridled compassion and vulnerability. These moments were special – Em made time for them, and we’d sneak between each other’s rooms past curfew, like so many do, just to share them. So much of her life was surrendered to my company. She had friends that weren’t me, and though she wasn’t super socially in-demand, she was popular. Her being best friends with me was the weird part. We were opposites in every way. She was tall, I was just shy of five foot. She was achingly pretty, I was achingly mundane. She was confident, and funny, and knew how to talk to people. She had long brownish-blond hair and was half-Chinese (on her mother’s side). She even smelled good – I didn’t even realise that was a real-ass thing until I met her. She was all of these things, yet so unashamedly herself. So unashamedly weird as shit. So unashamedly open with me. I was jealous.

A child of the internet generation, I had the words I needed to articulate and label how I was feeling, and the self-awareness to apply them if I wanted. I just didn’t want to use them. I wasn’t – I’m not - *gay*, but in retrospect, I had the biggest crush on her. I had never received friendship like this at an adult level, and I thought I never would have. Beyond having the hots for her, I still don’t understand if I was just conflating platonic love with romantic connection, coming from a lack of both – she didn’t like girls like that, so it wouldn’t have been reciprocated anyway. I felt like so abjectly wrong, so guilty, like some perversion of the soul. Impure. I wasn’t used to being treated like this, like another human. I was so used to feeling like someone alive past their own funeral, just watching a world without them - not a living, tangible thing. Usually, I didn’t feel like a girl – I fantasised a lot about being a guy, and I’d sometimes wish I had the body of a hot one, but I don’t think that would realistically fix anything. It wasn’t a gender thing. I just felt like I slipped between the binaries of personhood and un-personhood. I was so used to being this abstraction of form. Someone who failed to be human. I was disgusted with myself, meeting her gaze and feeling like I just want to kiss her and hold her and never let go. My eyes were watery, red, and heavy.

I’d share this with *BluFeb*, of course, just because I needed to tell someone. I’d tell him how ashamed of myself I was, how scared it made me feel. I don’t quite know how I felt so comfortable. Anonymity does crazy things to people, even though I wasn’t even anonymous. He was indiscriminate, and didn’t judge me, and he was a very good listener through all the bullshit I’d spew. He liked my jokes, and between the things we’d divulge, he’d share piecemeal parts of him too, faceless as he was.

I’d often dream of him around then. Sometimes we’d just, like, hang out, and talk about our emotions and shit. Other times, we’d fuck, as embarrassing and wrong as it is to say now. I never had the clearest picture of him, but I’d never imagine a student. Sometimes, whenever we’d just hang out, he’d just be a goat. Like the animal, silently trotting about. Usually, he looked like an early-30s, Caucasian male. But not a human, at least not a real one. Just something wearing a man. 

His body was chiselled as if it were sculpted in the image of antiquity by Michelangelo, his face was swarthy and handsome, and his hair was tousled and shaggy. He was *very* attractive, yet he posed like his body didn’t *fit*. He moved with a slump and a limp. His muscles deformed and sagged like thick and firm and puffy clothes. Something about his face was so close to human you’d notice the fraction of a thing that was off even more. His eyes didn’t glint in the light.

I wasn’t ever scared. He looked strange, but he was a calming presence. There’s much more to be scared of in this world. They were just dreams.

--- --- --- --- ---

With Em and *BluFeb*, time passed the quickest it ever had for me. Before I knew it, it was February again. As the month went on, the wintry weather began to clear. For context, it was still shit - of course it was, it was Britain - but instead of sleet and hail there was just downpour and more *grey-skies-with-the-sense-of-maybe-rain*. Em and I hung out more. We caught a bus and watched *The Elephant Man* in 35mm. I almost kissed her on her bed. 

Not soon after, she had killed herself.

In stories, this is where you’d be the first to find them. Fuck, maybe you’d even get a chance to hoist them up by the legs and make some crazy declaration about the value of life and save them. But the commotion ensured I was far from the first there. By the time I got there, the scene was teeming with people trying to keep order. Nobody was really trying to get in, nobody really stopped me walking up.

I remember seeing her, just hanging there. Weight slouched, the fray and the torque of the braided cable. Her long ribbons of hair draping her face. Her skin sallow and pale, her eyes glassy and saddened and bulging as if they were breaking free from the prison of her form. Her neck was crimson and smeared and her fingertips were bloody and lacerated. She died in pain. She was naked from the waist down. I remember the smells. The pores of the beige brick doorway I leaned on, the touch of the stray sunbeam from that slit of a window. It was warm and pearlescent, and cast a shithole room with a cosy morning glow.

I’ve never heard anyone mention this, so as far as I know, I am the only student who knew. She had that wall-hooked crucifix on the ground between her bare legs. I still don’t want to think that she *did* what I think she *did*, but seeing it there fucked me up the most.

I don’t want to cast my feelings into melodrama, but I was impossibly hurt. I was sad she could do this to herself. I was scared she could do this to herself. I felt angry and betrayed that she could selfishly leave me to my lonely and broken self, and then I felt guilt over being so selfish.  

They said she got into an explosive argument with another student over basically nothing at the canteen the evening before, and then promptly went to her dorm and didn’t leave. It just was like that. She was simply dead. I’m well aware of how you never truly know how someone is feeling, but I felt like she could have told me anything. I *hoped* she would have told me anything. I’m *well* aware a cursory glance won’t clue you in on anything, but through all our time together, she really just didn’t seem the type.

At first, I didn’t really notice anything aside from nausea. You only have the immediate absence of experiences, and eventually, that’s when you realise what you’re now feeling instead. I only ever spoke to her mum and dad twice again. I expressed my condolences like an answering machine and not a person. They were pretty beaten up about it and *shit*, I wonder why. About a week later they called and asked how I was doing, which was really sweet. I saw them once down the distance of a corridor, but they didn’t acknowledge I was there. And that was it. Their lives went on, completely separate from mine.

I was withdrawn. I’d go to my classes. That was it. I didn’t talk to teachers, to students. Not that I would normally anyway. I’d quietly and passively nod and nervously laugh away their occasional affirmations of strength or their supportive testimonies of how good a friend I was. I wouldn’t eat, really. I looked like utter shite. A living, dishevelled bag of shit. I didn’t go back to self-harming though, which in retrospect is something I’m pretty proud of.

--- --- --- --- ---                                                               

The lonelier I grew, the more I bonded with BluFeb. He offered me a (digital) shoulder to cry on. He innately understood how I felt, and how to tell me what I wanted to hear. How to get me to address my feelings. I stopped engaging with the few things I liked. For about, like, two or three weeks, he was my whole world. When I wasn’t in a class, I was talking to him. His schedule was the same as mine. I held onto my life in the glow of my monitor. The muffled purr of my little PC felt comforting, like a cat curled in your lap. You’d feel it warp its elastic-y body into all these shapes, the pressure of its paws kneading your thighs, the weight of it against your bones, the warmth of its body against your skin. The love you gain and get from it. My soul crawled out of my body and nestled in the liminal space between pixels. It was sanctuary. Fleeting, incandescent sanctuary, washing its hues across my lonely, dark dorm.

Looking back at it, I don’t really recall when the conversations turned sexual, but I rebuffed him almost instantly. We’d talked about that stuff before in the most platonic context you could, but at a certain point, it clearly became about his gratification. He tried requesting I send a video a few times, I’d tell him no, and then he’d get a little pushier through a mask of irony. I could just picture him sat on the other side of his screen. It didn’t bug me, honestly. I’m not stupid, I instinctively knew something didn’t add up, but I didn’t want to jeopardise whatever I had, whatever *that* was, whoever it was with. It didn’t take long for him to follow cue and drop it altogether, electing to pretend it didn’t happen at all - which, obviously, was fine by me.

--- --- --- --- ---

It was cold as always in my dorm room. It was April now, though you wouldn’t guess it. Greasy night-time rain beat on my window, and slicked the mosaic of cobbles outside. I’d been talking a lot about Em to him, though not in a way I’m sure she’d have appreciated. He’d get me to pull every fibre of my body out my mouth and spill my soul to him, to spew repressed vitriol fuelled by sadness, and to wallow and fester in it. It felt cathartic, but I felt empty, like my insides were shovelled out by a gravedigger. Repressed in the pit of my body, I still felt some reservations though. Mostly, I only felt a little hurt by him. He was invested and would always initiate, but he seemed irate. He acted desperate for something from me, which I’d just clock to personal life troubles. It devastated me, and I’d try everything to make our conversations reciprocal and worthwhile and equal and prove my appreciation. Eventually, we got into a fight, but I can’t remember what it was about. I tried so hard to appease him, I could only guess it was over some trivial bullshit.

I asked him if he was ok, he told me yes. He asked if I was ok, I told him yes. He said that it was April now, he didn’t have a lot of time to talk anymore, and that he was going home. He said he’d felt like he’d failed to properly make a friend. I asked him what he meant. He took a minute, and he responded.

*BluFebruary15: Want to see something cool?*

*\[1 image attached\]*

The image shows as a little thumbnail before you click it, so I could see what it was. So I don’t know why I did. It wasn’t like I’d forget it. I felt nothing, I felt everything. Mostly fear, a bit of sadness. I wanted to cry, but I didn’t, I wanted to just scream and vomit, but I didn’t. I didn’t know how to respond, so I just sat there, still, eyes trained. It was *Em*, hanging there.

I just stared at my screen. Didn’t know what else to do. I couldn’t move even if I wanted to. Her body was suspended in the perfect centre by the braided cord. The image was out of focus and very grainy, and poorly lit by the dim ceiling light, its beam intruded by her shape. It was black and white, and looked the difference between authentic film and some shitty app filter. The dark probably didn’t help. Holy shit, it was *night*. I felt by chest tighten. Deep shadows ganged and congealed together in the corners of the room, like some smoky, monochrome miasma. He was there *with* her.

*BluFebruary15: I’m an analogue person myself.*
