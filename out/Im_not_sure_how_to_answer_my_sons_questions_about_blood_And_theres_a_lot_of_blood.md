“Damien, you and I need to sit down and talk.” I folded one leg over the other, then switched legs, then leaned uncomfortably back on my arm in a desperate attempt to appear casual.

“Is it about masturbation?”

My stomach melted. “No, Damien.”

He stared at me inquisitively. “Jeffrey’s dad had an uncomfortable talk with him recently, and it was about-”

“[It’s about the rituals you’ve been having late at night in the living room](https://redd.it/187gzbp).”

“Oh.” 

“The ones with all the blood.” My neck got hot, and my underwear was uncomfortably sweaty. I was not enjoying myself. 

My son stared at me expectantly, as though getting caught performing violent rituals wasn’t a “but I’ll explain” moment. 

I cleared my throat. “You shouldn’t do that.”

“Why not?” He cocked his head. “I cleaned it up.”

I wanted to pull out all of my hair and shove it up my own ass in frustration. Gritting my teeth, I unbuttoned my shirt and pulled it open. “Because of *this*, Damien,” I huffed.

He stared at the three deep claw marks on my chest; for the first time in our conversation, he showed at least some level of reaction to what I was saying. The wounds burned red-hot as his eyes traced their contours.

“Why’d you go and get those?”

My eyes bulged. “I didn’t do this to *myself*, Damien! But I strongly suspect that it has *something* to do with the occult sacrifices that you’ve been practicing in the living room!”

His eyes flashed up to stare at me. “Did you disturb it?”

I took a deep breath, controlling my inhalation. “I couldn’t help stepping in the *blood* you left on the floor in the dark-”

He jumped back like he’d been burned. “You touched the blood?!” Without waiting for an answer, he grabbed my wrist and pulled me toward the front door.

I jogged halfheartedly behind him. He wasn’t very strong, so it wasn’t that difficult to pull back against his efforts to heave me forward. 

“Father - *oof* - we have to move-”

“Damien, before we go anywhere, you need to-”

And then it happened. 

The living room had been spotlessly cleaned since the night before. But overwhelming fear and dread washed through me as we passed by it nonetheless. As I set foot on the spot where the blood had been last night, icy hot pain drilled into the three claw marks on my chest. The agony was so overwhelming that I couldn’t breathe.

“Father, did you cross the bloodmark? Did you even *try* to cleanse yourself first?”

I wanted to scream in pain and frustration, but was too busy desecrating my underwear. I lurched forward without speaking and staggered behind Damien toward the open front door. The pain receded with each step – but the wetness and copper smell on my shirt told me without looking that I was covered in my own blood.

We were nineteen steps past the living room, and just thirteen from the front door, when it happened.

Thick, dark, scaly fingers curled around the frame. The claws on their tips looked remarkably similar to the deep cuts across my chest. 

Whatever stood outside wasn’t human or animal. 

The fear skyrocketed and bounced through my ribs; I didn’t know whether to keep running from the living room or to turn back in fear from the thing on the other side of the door. 

But it didn’t matter. The scaly hand drew the door shut. The daylight streaming through every window immediately switched to night. I slammed to a halt and pulled my son close.

“This is bad, right?” I whispered.

“Yes,” he answered. Cold mist now rose from both our mouths as we spoke. “This is very, very bad.”
