Last week was a real change of pace

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/6o9FIzqLF4


 It’s been a long time since I’ve been behind a keyboard so excuse me if I’m a little rusty. Of course, then I was at least talking about things that were grounded in science and logic. 

It’s Mike, and to sum up what was a very complicated decision, I stole Punch’s phone and took off on everyone in the middle of the night. 

I know, fuck me.

You guys are rooting for that little fella and you have every right to. But sometimes, you just have to do what you have to do. 

Why take the phone? To be honest, I’ve wanted to try and reach out to the world since I got tangled up in this. But this is the first time in a long while that my thoughts have been anything approaching coherent.

Why did I leave everyone? 

I need to find out what Demi is up to. I know who he is, I know how he thinks. Everything is at scale, his plans are never small. 

He’s my problem, and I can’t have him biting us in the ass. 

So now is the time to face what’s waiting for me. If I die, at least I keep it away from everyone else. 

 Following him is easy, our similarities are what let him worm his way into my brain without me realizing it after all. Catching up on the other hand, that’s the difficult part. 

After a couple of days of dodging creatures I’d rather forget and eating stolen MREs (what I know about hunting and foraging fits in a thimble with room to spare.) I see my first body. 

Human, not one of the lost. Saying he’s been killed would win me understatement of the year. He’s been disassembled, at first I think his bits and pieces have been scattered at random, but as I survey the scene, I see it. 

It's an arrow. With one word underneath it, “Waiting.”.

He’s getting off on this. The bastard loves death. 

Believe it or not, I never have. I’m not some lunatic destined to kill. I stumbled into a violent life and ever since it’s been taking little pieces of my sanity. 

Not here though. Over a decade of mental and physical trauma just, gone. A fresh start in a rotten world. 

With my burst blood vessel and flensed arm, I’m fucking that up already. 

I decide to change up my look a bit. Demi is going to be where people are, and I don’t know how much blending in I can do looking like a clown. 

I manage to do a little bit of wartime tailoring and hope it’s enough. I’d be more worried, but “Stuck in a paranormal dessert.” Isn’t a hard fashion statement to mimic. 

The walk is lonely on more levels than should be possible. I’ve spent the last few years hopping from one paranormal shitstorm to the next. A bit player in the struggles of a half dozen different groups. Losing pieces of myself and watching people die. 

But Punch and the guys, I don’t know. As fucked up as I am, it’s the first time I feel like I’ve fit in. I miss them. 

Then there’s the sudden near-silence in my skull. I’ve been hearing voices since I first watched the light fade out of someone’s eyes. Now, silence. 

I know a lot of what I am is the result of my brain not wanting to deal with the horrific crap I’ve seen, and done. But not them. Those 2 are, something else. Over time, I’ve grown to rely on them. 

Then again, isn’t that the type of backwards rationalization mentally unwell people make all the time? 

Either way, I find myself alone in my own mind as I find the next bodies. 

It was a struggle this time, on the open plains. A couple missing pieces from people who aren’t the deceased, deep pits in the gravel, this was an attack not a murder.  He’s either getting sloppy, or brazen. 

One thing I don’t notice are signs of, I don’t know the technical term, but, magic. No scorch marks, or anything else unnatural. Seems strange to me. From everything I know and have seen from Demi, that kind of stuff is his bread and butter. 

I pass the hours wondering if everyone else is all right. I know I don’t exactly pull my weight, but I hate the idea of leaving them alone. 

Have you guys ever wondered about clown college? 

A lot is what you’d think, the basics, learning routines, acrobatics, makeup. But really, that’s all stuff that any birthday party pretender can learn with a week and a Youtube account nowadays. 

The things you might be surprised by are the psychology, anthropology and first-aid courses. It’s the blending of all of this that gets you the right to have your face on an egg. 

Despite how it may seem, it’s really easy to fuck up being a clown. Now, that’s fine if you’re the cool uncle dressing up for a Bar-Mitzvah, but if you want to make things into a career, you need to understand people. 

Not only that but you need to be able to do it at a glance. Which kid is going to piss themselves when you walk over? Which bored dad is going to give you a tip, and which one is going to throw a drink in your face after a gag? My favorite professor had a great way of putting it, “Showmanship is fast-food psychology.”.

So I watch the groups of wanderers around me, looking for which ones may have been hit by Demi. Or which may make the most inviting target for his next violent urge. 



“Easy, I come in peace.” I say with a friendly smile. Holding up my hands and turning in a circle. 

“What’s in the bottle?” the young man, in his 20’s but with eyes that have seen a lifetime’s worth of horror, replies. He levels an old, worn rifle at me. 

“Seltzer, tastes like hell, but it’s safe to drink.” I explain. 

The group of ten people are guarded, but inviting none the less. Wounds over most of them, they’re all so young. The rifle wielding man, Nathan is the oldest of the bunch. 

“Sorry about the gun, got attacked a while back, thought you might have been the same guy.” Nathan explains, offering me what he vainly calls stew. 

“Was he taller than me? British accent?” I ask. 

Nathan looks suspicious, I hear another member of the group readying something. 

“Friend of yours?” The worn man says. 

“Not in the slightest. I’m looking to find him though.” I say, darkly. 

“You’re going to need more than a bottle of water. The guy is a monster. Killed two of ours. Had to shoot him three times to get him to notice, even then, didn’t find a body.” Nathan explains. 

“Any idea which way he went?” I ask. 

“East, for all that’s worth around here.” Nathan answers. 

“Much appreciated. The food as well. 

How did you guys end up here?” I inquire. 

“My college is partnered with a high school. Every year we do an event where we take a bunch of kids for a week and show them the college life. Let them sit in on a few classes, go to some events, get a taste of what they have to look forward to.

Day 5 we went to an amusement park, took them into a maze. Last thing I remember was touching two walls, then we were here. That was about a month or so ago.” Nathan replies. 

I pump the group for information in the guise of swapping war stories. I make up a name, a life, I tell them what they want to hear. I become a person they’re comfortable with, even though I’m not. 

 Demi hit them like a tiger. Breaking apart two members of their group in front of them. 

Nathan says it seemed like he was asking the victims questions, but they didn’t make sense. 

Something feels off. Why leave the rest? If it was supposed to be a message, why not have them relay it? 

But that’s the problem dealing with someone like Demi. I’m trying to outwit a brain with a couple extra centuries of processing power in it. 

None the less, come morning, I’m following the lead, and heading east. 

As I watch a Grasping in the distance, I find myself laughing. There was a point in my life where I couldn’t wrap my brain around being involved in a couple of minor conspiracies. Now I’m watching a giant set of clawed hands pluck people from the desert like popcorn. 

I heat my second to last MRE in an island of brittle needle-leaved trees. Things with large reflective eyes stare at me from high branches. I haven’t caught a glimpse of one yet, but as long as they don’t get any closer, they can keep being spooky all they want. 

Movement in the trees in front of me. I get low, slinking to the edge of the firelight. 

I clutch what’s left of my walking stick. One end jagged, my heart races. 

What comes out of the disintegrating needles of the forest floor, doesn’t really strike fear in my heart. 

Makes sense, I guess not everything “That never was” is going to be that way because it’s horrifying. 

4 Large black eyes, six stubby, arachnid-like legs covered in long, black and white fur. It stumbles, and I notice it’s bleeding. 

 I know, you’ve all read stories of angler-fish like things. And the internet tough guys are going to be ranting about how stupid it was to go up to the thing. But the human brain is set up in a certain way, we have empathy for a selection of features. Call me a caveman, but I didn’t like seeing the little thing in pain. 

No real teeth or claws I can see, I kneel down, expecting to see some kind of bite or lodged object. But as a guy who knows his wounds, the two inch gash on this creature looks…

“Purposeful.” I say feeling a long, cold knife press itself against my throat.

“Don’t worry Michael, she’ll be fine. You on the other hand, I’m not so sure.” Demi growls into my ear. 

 The wide bodied, needle pointed dagger is sharp enough to be drawing blood already. I can smell the reek of Demi’s breath. 

My heart pounds, I start to pour sweat. As I see the massive, scarred hand holding the knife, I’m at a loss as to what I could do to stop him. 

“What do you want?” I say, calmly, trying not to upset the ancient killer. 

“I don’t think we have that long Michael. I’m a man of grand aspirations.

But what I need from you is my pound of flesh.” Demi says, angling the blade so it’s tip rests under my jaw. The pain as the immaculate point hits bone is stunning. 

I stay silent. I’m overwhelmed, outmatched, and unarmed. It’s all I can do to not piss myself. 

We stand in silence, I fail to remain stoic. Tears start to fall as I think of the fact this is where everything ends. 

I feel the knife move, Demi growls, I wait to feel the blood pour down my chest. Hoping a slit throat is as far as he takes it.

With a silver blur Demi strikes me in the forehead with the flat of the blade. The pain is unbearable, I hit the ground clutching my skull. 

I hear Demi walk to the other side of the fire, mumbling something I can’t quite make out. 

Red spots in my vision, “ Fuck!” I scream trying to focus beyond the nagging pain. 

“There was a time when you would have heard me coming a hundred meters off, and would have bitten off my thumb instead of submitting to me.” The Ripper says in a disappointed tone.

“That’s paranoia and delusions for you.” I spit. 

I’m going to have one hell of a bruise, but all things considered, my head is fine. 

“Is it really paranoia when they’re out to get you?” Demi asks with a smirk. 

“What are you getting at?” I reply, annoyed. 

“I’d think it’s obvious. 

Your friends don’t need a well adjusted Children’s performer. They need someone who can do the wrong thing for the right reason.” Demi says.

“He’s called Leo, and he does it ten times more effectively than I do.” I explain. 

“Leo is the issue. 

I’m not blessed with foresight. In fact, here, I’m blessed with nothing. 

But I’ve always been a little faster, stronger, smarter, and keener, than most. That, is my essence.

This place is making him see things in very black and white terms. He cannot abide the creature below the sand.” Demi says. 

“And? Him, Sveta, and Punch? I wouldn’t want to be Mr. Sandy.” I reply dismissively. 

“Take it from someone who has been watching. 

That lot has been bludgeoning their way to unlikely victory. The thing below is not going to be overpowered, tricked, or scared into submission.” Demi says. 

“So, what’s the scam Demi? Can we bypass all of the manipulation? I’m saying yes or dying, I get that.” I ask.

“The thing below, it’s getting tired of the millennia of eating scraps. It’s begun to overstep it’s bounds.

It speaks to people, convinces them to lead their fellows into it’s eager maw. 

It’s only a matter of time before Leo figures this out and leads you all into a half-planned march to death. 

Personally, I say we mind our own affairs and make it to the city post-haste. But none of them are going to listen to me. Nor would they be willing to do what needs to be done if they did.” Demi explains. 

“You’ve got a plan and it’s going to involve casualties is what you’re saying, right?

I can’t, I’m not going to do that to myself, again.” I reply. 

Demi stares at me, minutes of silence, nothing to do but notice the barely restrained rage in his heavy features. 

“This isn’t real, you fucking twit. 

There isn’t enough of me left to rattle a chain or fog a window. Your mind has been torn apart in ways that will never heal. 

If you don’t accept that, you will wind up destroyed entirely. Or worse, you’ll embrace this place, and become a resident of the city. 

I know you’re thinking of it. But understand, for all the blood I’ve spilled, for all the lives I’ve ended. That was a bridge too far for me at my worst.”   Demi growls. 

The realization hits me. I’m sure I’d have caught on quicker if I sprouted a screaming second head, or my mind somehow got worse. But that’s how insidious this place is. 

“You could be lying.” I say, weakly. 

“No, I simply want this to be over. I want us back trying to figure out how we can go our separate ways. 

I’m sick of being used as some kind of McGuffin when you find yourself in over your head.” Demi replies. 

“I’ll keep you trapped there as long as I can. Whatever you do, however you help, you’re Jack the Ripper.” I state. 

“Bully for you. 

Now that we’ve both stated our opinions, and future plans, are we in agreement on a course of action in the present?” Demi asks. 

I don’t give him the satisfaction of an answer. The worst part of all of this isn’t that I don’t have a choice, I could walk away right now. It’s that I know he’s right. The fact I think like the monster in front of me, looming in the firelight like death itself, makes me sick. 



As we begin our journey, Demi catches me up on the group he’s been following. Six massive guys, wearing sports jerseys of some form. Even from a distance I can tell they’ve been here a while, they way they’re built that doesn’t come from training. 

One of them has the thing below deep in his mind. He’s intent on collecting others, and delivering them to it’s waiting grasp. 

“So, we figure out which one, you kill him, we’re done. I don’t see where the moral ambiguity comes in.” I say as we watch them from afar. 

“I don’t care about saving some morons who couldn’t avoid a pit to hell. 

This peon, has a connection to the one below. We’re going to need to get information from him, in ways that will make people likely to want to stop us. 

Beyond that we have to actually figure out who he is, which we can’t do without mingling with the meat.” Demi explains. 

“It’s shit like calling people ‘meat’ that makes trusting you impossible. I just thought I’d point that out.” I reply. 

By the time we catch up to the group they’ve joined with another half dozen or so people. Demi does sweet fuck all to try and appear as anything other than what he is, while I put on my friendliest face and lie about who we are and what we’re doing here. 

A man standing as tall as Demi walks over. Clapping him on the shoulder. From this close, the sports team members are freakishly large. Borderline inhuman. 

“Bro, sick hat. Looks like you shoot hoops? Am I right? 

Name’s Moussa, means Moses in Arabic.” The man says with level of enthusiasm that borders on stimulant driven. 

“Good thing we’ve came across you in a desert then.” Demi says dryly.   

Moussa laughs, a barking obnoxious sound. 

“This Guy? He’s a G!”  Moussa replies with another slap on the back. 

We find out that they were part of a rugby team, The Seattle Sturgeons. Their bus went through a tunnel, and before it came out the other end, they found themselves here. 

I pick out a couple of interesting individuals in the second group. 

We’ve got a survivalist type, with enough gear he wouldn’t  miss a couple of pieces. 

And a scrawny meth-goblin looking guy with a drug-aged face, and a backpack he is guarding like his life depends on it. 

Otherwise, as night falls, I find the dynamics of the groups themselves more interesting. 

A camp is set in an area of metallic looking overgrowth. A fire, too large to be sensible is made, and friendships begin to quickly form. Food is shared, and from somewhere bottles of liquor, cigarettes and other good-time fuel is passed around. 

I see it and it chills me to the core. The thing below the sand set this all up, picked out these two groups to be lead to their demise. Everything goes a little too well, with a lack of the suspicion that breeds during this kind of trauma. 

 A deep longing, a demon more realistic but just as insidious hits me as I see the bottles of generic looking booze being passed around. I struggle with myself. Real or not, I want to try and enjoy this reprieve from my mental and physical issues as long as I can.

As I observe, looking for the Judas sheep, I hear a strange, repetitive noise. A pressurized sound, like a muffled spray can. I track it to the underweight addict, who also seems the source of the party’s healthy supply of inebriants. He’s taking huffs from a can of computer duster, puling the cans from his backpack along with the more common ways of dulling one’s senses. 

“That one.” Demi says, pointing to a member of the Rugby team. A pale skinned man of about 40 built like a Canadian beer bottle.  

I don’t disagree. The guy has been mingling like he’s at a job fair. 

“Let me try and talk to him. Having something in your head asking you to do fucked up things is something I can relate to.” I say. 

Demi sighs, annoyed. 

“Fine.” He says simply, I can practically hear the eye roll. 

I’m sober as a judge but multiple decades of a drinking problem lets me put on a very convincing act. I watch the stout man, waiting for liquor to take it’s inevitable toll. 

I follow him outside of the camp. 

“I’d ask if you were breaking the seal, but around here that seems kind of sinister.” I say with a mild slur, laughing at my own joke. 

“Yeah, don’t want to be inviting any bad Mojo I guess. I’m Kyle.” The stout man says, relieving himself. 

“So, Kyle, once we’re done I want to run something by you.” I say, keeping my tone friendly, and neutral. 

“Flattered man, but not my thing. You probably have a shot with Eric though.” Kyle says. 

I chuckle as we both finish up. 

“Not quite what I wanted to talk about, but it does have to do with having something inside of you.” I say, calling out his deflection. 

I notice a shift, Kyle stands defensively, keeping his distance. Suspicion washing over his face. 

“Easy, I’m here to help. 

That thing in your head isn’t in control. It might feel like it, but you’re still at the wheel. 

I just want to see what you…” I’m interrupted by Kyle drawing a wide spring-assisted knife.

Kyle stands in silence. I look to the knife, then back to him. 

“It’s been a long time since I’ve worried about a pocketknife. Let’s keep things civil.” I say coldly. 

Kyle thinks for a moment, his grip on the blade tightening. Tension rises, my heart begins to pound. 

Then he does something unexpected. 

Instead of lunging, or grabbing me, he slashes himself across the face and arms, throwing the knife at my feet. He grins to me, face streaming blood before he screams. 

“Help, he just pulled a knife on me, he’s crazy!” 

He sprints back to the camp, I know exactly how coming in hot behind him is going to look, but I see where this situation is going and it’s nothing but pain for everyone involved. 

Kyle gets to his friends before I can catch up. He’s putting on a great act, and as i get to the group, they form a protective semi circle. 

“Guys, I didn’t lay a hand on him…” I begin before a man with short blond hair and a last name of “Milton” emblazoned on his jersey shoves me. 


He doesn’t brace himself, he doesn’t step in, but none the less, I hit the ground ass first. I smack the back of my head off of the course sand, and can feel a hematoma start to form on my chest. 

I struggle to breathe as I get to my feet. I’m scared shitless, Milton here just hit me like a baseball bat without trying. 

“Stay back and get the hell out. We don’t want any trouble.” Milton says, fixing me with a steel gaze set a little too far back in his skull. 

I wheeze, feeling the situation start to spiral out of control. 

What’s worse is that the rugby players, they don’t want to hurt me. This place has done a number on them physically, but besides their corrupt companion, they’re all good guys. 

I stumble backwards, toward Demi, my overworked brain trying to come up with some way to get this situation under control. No one has to get hurt here, I know it. 

The players keep their distance, but the scuffle has started to attract the attention of the rest of the group. 

“Demi, I need help.” I manage to say between gasping breaths. 

He’s close enough to me I can hear his whisper. 

“I meant what I said. I’m tired of being your Deus Ex Corydon. 

Make your own way this time you ungrateful little louse.”

The next words he says are screamed and directed toward the group. When he wants to he does a damn fine impression of fear.

“Please, he has a pistol and has been keeping me hostage. He’s dangerous!”  

And that was the spark this powderkeg needed. 

As a group the crowd advances toward me, but Moussa sprints out ahead, eager to stop my imagined crimes. 

He’s drunk, low and clearly intending on a tackle. His jaw is wide open by the time he gets to me. 

The impact sounds like a gunshot in the suddenly quiet night. The blow makes the tanned giant stumble, but it’s more out of confusion than pain or impact. 

He’s with it enough to wrench out a bloody fistful of my hair as I stumble backwards clutching my throbbing hand. 

I have the delicate hands of a stage magician, honed by palming coins and repairing watches. Not the scar layered brawler’s meathooks I’ve built up over a decade. 

Demi casually sits on a chrome colored tree stump. Shaking his head at my attempt to keep things PG.

All I’ve succeeded in doing is trapping and wounding myself. Moussa on one side, the crowd on the other, and my right hand starting to go numb. 

I can hear my heart pounding in my ears. My vision starts to narrow, my body trembles. If this were an action movie it’d be the precursor to me pulling off some kind of miracle and destroying these half-human hardmen. 

But it isn’t. This is me, without the years of coping mechanisms and experience  being thrown into certain death. I freeze. I don’t feel like I’m really there anymore. I struggle against my fraying mind. I try to stay in the fight, but suddenly there is a ringing in my ears, pain in my face and I’m on the ground. 

The punch puts me out for a second, I come to arms pinned by 300 pounds of athlete. 

Another blow, the world seems far away now. My sight is a cotton wraped haze. I taste copper. 

I try to raise my shoulders. 

“Stay down!” Moussa yells, throwing a punch hard enough to pull a muscle in my neck. 

I can tell though, he doesn’t want to kill me. He’s pulling these punches, brutal as they are. 

I get a leg under me and push. I manage to turn my body, use the shifting sand below me to my advantage. With every bit of flexibility I have, I manage to push myself, squirming out of his grip. 

For about a second and a half. 

He grabs my ankle in a crushing grip, yanking me backwards. My face rebounds off of the course sand large particles chipping teeth and tearing flesh, smaller ones grinding into the wounds. 

He falls on me like a lead blanket, one massive arm locking below my chin. Still trying to avoid anything permanent. 

I panic, my mind failing to draw on instincts left half way across reality. 

“Just go to sleep bro, you lost it is all. Chill!” Moussa says, mouth fractions of an inch away from my ear. 

I sob, understanding that I’m going to die here. While that evil piece of shit watches, and probably cuts some kind of deal with the thing below us. 

The chokehold is sloppy, Moussa in a terrible position. 

I don’t know If I’m being literal or metaphorical, but a part of my soul dies as I feel the eyeball burst under my thumb. I feel the electric zap of brain chemistry starting to fail. 

The eye itself doesn’t feel much pain, but the nerve behind it, and the thin wall of bone behind that, are a whole different story. 

I break my own kind of seal then, knowing that I can’t take back what I did, and the only hope of not having to do worse, is to make it count. 

Moussa scrambles away, toward the crowd, but I keep pace, thumb twisting and scraping. The shrill screaming from him hits me worse than his fists. I feel dizzy. 

The crowd is a few feet away now, I turn toward them, forcing myself through the pain and trauma, to grin. 

I hold the giant athlete’s head like a loaf of bread I’m about to break, my left thumb pressing down on his remaining eye. 

I don’t want to be the bad guy, the lunatic, the psychopath. In fact, I’m not. I shiver like a junkie as every instinct demands I stop this brutality. 

But right now, it’s the only thing keeping me alive. It’s the only hope my friends have, if Demi is to be believed anyway. 

“Next person to take a step gets to teach this asshole how to read braille.” I say, trying to drive my malfunctioning brain to some kind of plan beyond convincing these people I’m scarier than I am. 

I know, I hate cliffhangers as much as the next guy, but believe me, you guys are going to need a break. 

After this, things get really fucked up. 

Till next time. 

Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do. 

Mike.
