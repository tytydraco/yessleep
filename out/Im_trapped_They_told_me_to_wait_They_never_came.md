It’s been three days. I think.  
Honestly, I don’t even know anymore—I stopped keeping track.

No food. No water. Not even light.  
Just me, alone in my bedroom, sitting in the dark, surrounded by bottles full of my own piss.

The brightness on my phone is all the way down. I’m saving the battery—what little I have left.

It’s quiet. Too quiet.  
Except for the occasional fly...  
And *the whistle.*

It's becoming unbearable now. I can't sleep anymore. Can't ignore it anymore. It's getting louder every single time I hear it. I know it's getting closer. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Call 911? I have tried that. Guess what they said?

"Alright sir, we'll send a deputy right over there. Just keep waiting patiently."

It was assuring at first, but something felt off. I did not have to wait long to realize what was going on. Still, I tried again.

"911, what's your emergency?"

"It's outside my fucking door. I called you guys before, where's the deputy. You remember, right?"

"Just keep waiting sir. Be patient, stay calm"

"But---"

They hung up.

That's when I realized. They weren't going to come. They never meant to come.

I called my friends. They were sympathetic, until they heard about the whistle. 

Click. 

Instant hang up.

I called my dad. Maybe he could bring the Winchester. He said he would be right there.

He didn't come.

I called the others.

They didn't even pick up.

I had no choice, not anymore. I had to stay or fight my way out. I decided to stay. Call me a coward, but I like to stay alive.

I wasn’t always in the dark.  
The first day, maybe the second, I kept the curtains open just a bit. I wanted to know what was making the noise.  
Wanted to *see* it.  
Stupid decision.

The street outside was empty. No wind. No movement. It was as if the whole world was hiding from it. But I still kept the curtains open, just to see the sun.

Then one night, I finally saw it. Not clearly. Just a glimpse.  
Across the road, behind the neighbor’s car. Something felt off.  
The car looked… wrong. Slightly stretched, too tall on one side. I thought maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me.

Then it moved.  
Or maybe it *unfolded*.

A tall figure pulled itself away from the car, like it had been glued to the metal.  
Its red coloring faded, slowly draining to a pale, almost sickly white.

That's when I realized what it was. It was fucking camouflaging. And maybe... it too realized that I.... realized. 

It turned towards me immediately.

No face. No eyes. No nose.  
Just a wide, open mouth, and a long, snake-like tongue slowly writhing from it—feeling the air, as if tasting me.

I dropped behind the bed so fast I cut my hand on the frame. I didn’t scream. Didn’t cry.  
I just pulled the curtain shut.  
Tied a hoodie around it.  
Shoved a chair in front for good measure.

I haven’t opened them since.

But after this, the whistle started. Not a tune. Not like a person whistling.  
It was like… wind through bone.  
Or someone dragging their mouth across a hole in a flute, slowly.

Then just today, my phone was vibrating. I picked it up and realized that it was 911.

I didn't know whether to feel relief or to be more scared. 

"Hello?"

"Hi, we have a deputy outside your house. Please open the front door."

"Really? Oh...thank god. I thought you guys would never come."

"Yes. Please just open the door. Or make a noise to alert the officer where you are."

Something felt off about this.

"Uhm...no. That puts me in danger."

"Do it. Now"

I hung up. 

That voice wasn’t *right*. It was too flat. No static. No typing in the background.  
Just... *empty air.*

But I had to be sure. So, I peeked through the curtain.

Sure enough, it was there.

Closer than ever.  
Standing motionless on my porch,

That’s why I’m in the dark.  
Not because I’m scared of the dark.  
I’m scared of what’s looking in.

And now it won't leave me alone. It's definitely in my house. Where? I don't know. But I can *feel* it when I blink. I can *hear* it breathing, just barely, when I hold mine.

You all know what it is. The whole internet knows. I had seen videos of it, before the lockdown. Before I got into this situation.

Now I have only 2 choices.

1. I stay trapped here, slowly waiting for my death like a fly caught on a spider's web. And even if it doesn't catch me, I would still die of starvation.

2. I go out. I try my best to run. Not to fight, oh no no. Just to run.

  
The only reason I am posting this here is so that others don't do the same mistake as me. Stay in your home, keep the curtains closed, and most importantly, if you live in \[\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\] MOVE OUT NOW.

But if anyone still lives nearby, please try to help me. I know I'm asking a lot. I know I'll get downvoted into oblivion. But if you see this, pls just try.

There's not much time left. The whistling keeps getting closer.
