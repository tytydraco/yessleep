Hi my name is John Davies and whoever finds this please stop what you’re doing and hear me out. 

Im lost. I don’t know where I am. I need help. It all started when I met Jessica, the most beautiful woman i’ve ever come across 

I was working late in the office, when a woman approached me and introduced herself, Jessica Carter. I saw astounded by her natural beauty but didn’t let it show or so I thought. I wanted to talk to her a bit more, so in lunch break I asked if she wanted me to introduce her to the business a bit more, she said “sure!”. While talking I found out she’s into writing books, which I was working on a novel myself. I got my notebook out of my backpack and showed her some ideas I had thought of for a new book and she loved my ideas, so we decided to meet for coffee to share ideas. 

I won’t give all the details because that’s not important right now. After a while, we start dating. Everything was going perfectly. I have had my fair share of exes and they would break up with me after about 2 months, we had been together for 6.  I thought something was wrong with me but now I guess not.  She really improved my self esteem. 

After a while, I introduce her to my mom, dad and Mike, my younger brother. They all like her which is good. She feels comfortable around them.

She introduces me to her parents and sister Sophie, they were all so nice.  Made me feel so welcome. I thought to myself how are things going so perfect considering my past relationship history?

I can’t run out of character limits, I’ll just get to it. We planned to have date night at her apartment. I saw her text and I said I was staying at my parents for the night, Mom and dad are on a date and little brother just left she can come here if she wants. She replied “Ok! Sounds good.” and was about to leave, I thought.   I waited an hour and nobody showed up. I realise I’m eating all the popcorn we were supposed to share and the clock struck 8:00 when she was supposed to be there at 6:30. I called and called but no answer so I decide to go to her apartment to apologise because she’s probably mad I suggested coming here. My ex would always complain about “me changing location” and I thought i’ll just go and apologise. 


The door is unlocked, so she was expecting me to turn up. I walk in and there’s no sign of Jessica. I get so confused but then i hear the house phone ring, I pick up. I say “hello?” they say “No sign of Jessica hm?” My face looks confused and shocked. I say “What? Who is this!?” They pause for a moment before hanging up. I get so scared and see a note on the fridge saying “Hi, I have a surprise, meet me at the beach.” I go into my car and drive to our favourite beach, where I see no sign of Jessica or anyone there. It’s almost 9pm, and nobody is in sight. I see the canoes, but that’s it. Suddenly this person comes out of nowhere and stabs me at the side of my stomach. I start screaming and all I see is a guy with a mask on with a bloody knife. I try to run but the person tackles me down. He said “Do you know why you never get to keep any girlfriends?” I say “What?” “What’s going on?!” He says “Because I show them my knife collection, some with blood and say it’s yours.” I get so confused, before recognising the voice, it’s my younger brother. I scream and try to run to one of the boats. I hear “Don’t run John, remember when we used to be best friends?” I grab the canoe and row into the ocean. There was nowhere else to run. I see my brother staring at me as I boat away, still holding the knife.


 I wrote all this on the boat and I just reached land. It’s only been an hour. I’m lost, I don’t know where I am but i’m on a beach. Please show this to the police because my girlfrien
