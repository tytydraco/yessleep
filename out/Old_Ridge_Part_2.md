PART TWO:



The drive was excruciating. I was exhausted, but I couldn’t sleep. Every time I shut my eyes, there she was, laying there on the road in between her car and the white van. Her small car’s front end was completely obliterated in the crash, making the engine and car itself unusable. The side of the van didn’t take as much damage, but was still caved in. The image of my sister’s mangled body stuck to my brain like gum on the bottom of my shoe. I just wanted to forget, I needed to. But I never will. My dad glanced over periodically and noticed my antsy movements and behavior. 



“You doing okay son?” 



“Yeah… no.”



“I’m sorry… good news is, we’re almost there. We can try and get comfortable in the new house.”



The next exit sign showed ‘OLD RIDGE PIKE’ in big white letters. I was excited to see civilization. This whole time, I’ve just been looking out the window, only to see either trees or areas of flat grass. While I was excited, I was still nervous to know what kind of town Old Ridge was really like. Maybe the old man was just losing his mind, but I still don’t like the implications he made about this small town. We got off the exit and I instantly felt a pit in my stomach. It was as if an energy field was surrounding the edges of town, the borders not able to contain whatever was lurking inside Old Ridge.



The town looked as normal as any other. But at the same time, it looked a little too normal that it looped back around to being strange. There was a gas station off the exit that I had never heard of before, there were no fast food chains, only local restaurants. Every shop that we passed by were miniscule, grocery stores were local as well. The town was small, but I didn’t expect it to be a ghost town. There were zero cars driving past and no signs of life in any parking lots.



We drove past the strip of stores and commodities and got to the neighborhoods. It was a small road that split off into separate sections of houses. The road had so many twists and turns that it felt like we would drive off into the adjacent forest any second.



We turned into a neighborhood named ‘Woodwind Drive’, our new living space. The houses looked all too simple, all having the same core features: Comprised of brown bricks on most of the walls, white garage doors and roofs, windows spaced evenly around the outer walls. However, there was one anomaly within each house. At the top left corner of each garage door was a different, vibrant color imprinted into the dark brown bricks. Every house I saw was a different color hue, every color you could think of was in this neighborhood, displayed on each and every person’s home.



My dad pulled into our driveway, the house looking like all the others. The color on our house was a bright cyan. The house’s color on the left and right of ours were a darker magenta and a deep orange respectively. Dad pushed open the door and jumped out.



“We’re here! It’s quite… homey.”



“Yeah, looks super original.” I said as I looked at all the other identical houses.



“Hey, chin up! Let’s start moving these boxes inside.”



I got out and popped open the trunk to see our boxes still semi-intact. I grabbed the closest one with a bit of a struggle as I brought it to the front door. My dad was close behind with another box and set it on top of mine. He looked at the giant lock on the front door.



“Ah, the realtor said the key should be in a bush near the front walkway…”



We both looked around the front to see five bushes, all of identical shape and size. I searched around the leftmost, while he searched the right. I felt around in the second one and touched something cold and metallic. I pulled it out from under the bush’s leaves and branches.



“Got it.”



I handed it to my dad who inserted the key into the lock. He turned the key with force and the lock came open with a loud click. He turned the knob and opened it sluggishly. The inside was completely empty, devoid of any life or personality.



“C’mon sport, let’s move in!”



I gave him a small eye roll for his impossibly positive personality. I felt bad about it after the fact, he’s just trying to cheer us up given the situation. We both started moving the boxes into the house, going back out to grab another from the car, and bringing them in again like an assembly line. Once my dad grabbed the last one, I shut the trunk door behind him and followed him back in the house. We placed the boxes in the kitchen near the island. I looked around my new surroundings. The kitchen looked like a dream compared to our old one, practically double the size. The food cabinet was so spacious that I could’ve fit inside it and easily shut the door. The living room was massive, enough to fit two sets of couches and TVs.



The back door was a glass sliding door that viewed a beautiful backyard, with perfectly cut grass and a forest beyond it. There was a small porch that the doors led out to, just a slab of concrete to put a table and a few chairs on, though. 



“Dad, are you sure you were able to pay for this?”



“Of course! What, you think I stole it or something?” he snickered.



“No, no… it’s just that this place is amazing compared to before.” He nodded in agreement and gave me a light-hearted smirk.



I walked up the stairs, and to my surprise, they didn’t creak in agony as I stepped on them. It was as if I became as light as a feather. There were two bedrooms upstairs: a master and a regular. Across from the regular, which is where I assumed I’d be staying, was a decently sized bathroom. The master bedroom wasn’t all that much bigger than the regular, it was just the fact that it had a bigger bathroom inside. I looked at my room and planned out where everything would go. The bed can go in that corner and the desk and computer can go across from the closet door. My dad came up the stairs and awed at the rooms.



“Wow, it’s even better than the pictures!” He walked in the master bedroom and spun around, eyes darting around the room. I walked in behind him.



“Yeah, I like it.”



“Whaddya say we go out and get some food and furniture?”

  
  


\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

  
  


First, we wanted to find a restaurant to eat at because we haven’t eaten anything during the car ride. We found a place named ‘Charcoal Grille’. We didn’t need to make any reservations and sat ourselves. I took a look at the menu and they had your run-of-the-mill items you’d find at a grill place. When the waitress came to us for menu orders, I asked for the ‘Grilled Chicken Char-Wrap’. She gave me a puzzled look.



“…Char-Wrap? I don’t think we…” She took a quick glance at my menu.



“Oh right, sorry! It seems like they change this menu every day at this point!” She made a soft chuckle and proceeded to look at my dad. 



“And you, sir?”



“I’ll have the… ‘Salmon On the Rocks’ please.”



“You got it! I’ll have those out to you two shortly!”



Her reaction to my order was confusing to me. How does a waitress not know what items are on their menu? They didn’t seem like they were inexperienced; there wasn’t anyone training her while taking our orders. Even if they change the menu frequently, you’d think she’d be told the new item on the menu beforehand. I shook it off as maybe she was tired or just not up to it that day.



We left the restaurant after filling our bellies and our next stop was for furniture. My dad stopped at a place named ‘Andy’s Furniture’ for two bed frames, two mattresses, a couch, a small dining table with two chairs, and maybe a porch table with two chairs. The store clerk greeted us and we looked around for what we needed. The prices seemed to be decently cheap, I just hoped that my bed frame wouldn't collapse below me during my slumber. We managed to get everything we wanted for around $650. We then realized after the fact that we couldn’t bring all of this home, not in one trip anyway. My dad spoke up to the clerk.



“Do you guys happen to have a moving truck we could borrow for all of this?”



“Why yes we do! Although, it does cost an extra $20 for gas and other fees. Is that okay?”



“Yeah that’s perfect.”



My dad handed the clerk the extra $20 and he gave dad the keys to the moving truck in return. The man offered to help move the boxes into the truck and dad accepted. The two of them picked up the couch, one on each end, and headed to the truck, which was parked near the side of the building. I picked up two chairs and trailed behind them. Oddly, the moving truck’s back door and ramp were already open and set up. They carefully set the L-shaped couch down in the back corner of the truck. I set the chairs on top of the couch to conserve room. We made three more trips and fit all of the items inside.



“Alright, you’re all set! Once you’re done, just park it back here and leave the keys inside. Make sure to bring back the truck in the condition you found it! Be safe!”



The clerk waved us goodbye and walked back inside the store. We hopped in the truck and made our way back home. The ride was bumpy, and I especially thought anything that was made of glass in the back would instantly shatter once we got on the windy road to our neighborhood. We got to the house and my dad backed into the driveway. I opened up the back door of the truck and surprisingly, everything was perfectly fine. My dad punched in the code to our garage door that the realtor gave to him. The door slid open with a jolt and made a grinding metallic sound as it slid all the way up. I pulled out the ramp and we started to take everything inside. First the couch, which took the both of us to move. Everything else was pretty easy, but awkward to move individually. Some items had to be pivoted sideways through the door to even fit, like the tables and bed frames, but we managed. Once all the furniture was inside and in place, my dad let out a long sigh.



We drove back to the furniture store to drop off the loading truck, left the keys in the cup holder, and went back to his car. The last stop for the day was groceries, but my dad said something about a surprise on the way there. The surprise turned out to be a bike shop named ‘Gavin’s Bikes and Skates’.



“I just figured with this town being so small, you could use a bike to get around, y’know?”



“Aw sweet, thanks dad!”



“Oh, it’s no biggie, anything for my little boy!” He let out a belly laugh and ruffled my hair.



He let me pick one out from the racks. One particular one caught my eye. It had black as the base with red and orange streaks going around it like flames in the wind. It was the perfect size for me. He bought it and stashed it in the trunk. I was pretty ecstatic, I would be able to ride the bike from my house to the core of the town in a few minutes.



We quickly got the groceries, only grabbing the core ingredients: bread, eggs, milk, deli meats, cheese, etc. We quickly got home and put all the cold ingredients in the fridge. I decided to get comfortable and throw myself on the new couch, bathing in the soft pillows and cushions. My dad sat across from me, looking at me seriously.



“Look son, I didn’t tell you this before, but I have to go out to my new job for training tonight. I’ll be there for a few days, so you’ll have to fend for yourself. I’m sure you’ll be fine, I know you’re not a kid anymore. You got that bike, if you need anything from town you can just zip up there real quick and come back in a jiffy.” A long pause drifted throughout the living room.



“Alright, yeah, I’ll be fine. Maybe I’ll take my bike out to town to find a job while you’re gone.”



“Oh buddy, you don’t have to. Trust me, I’m able to take care of the money, promise.”



“I know, but I’d still like the money.”



“Fair enough.” He stood up from the couch and let out a yawn. “Welp, I best get going now.”



“But I thought you said you’re leaving tonight?”  
  


“Well y’know, the earlier the better. I might get lost in this new town. I’m gonna leave $100 in the kitchen for food and anything else. If you ever need anything, just call me, okay?” I gave him a nod.



He got dressed in formal black and headed out the door after saying our goodbyes. For a while I just sat on the couch thinking about this weird town. But about ten minutes after he left, I decided to use my new bike to go back into town. I did want to look for a job, but wasn’t really interested in searching on the first day in town. I brought $20 from the $100 on the counter with me in case I found any interesting shops. And that I did. A little shop named ‘Ceramic Souvenirs’ with large text below it saying ‘INDIVIDUALLY OWNED!’. I decided to check it out and opened the door. The man at the counter seemed to be in his eighties and looked like the biggest bundle of joy a man could show on their face.



“Why, hello there young man! Is there anything I can interest you in?”



“Not exactly, just looking around.”



Most of the items for sale were pottery; what did I expect when I saw the name of the store? Many flower pots, plates, cups, that sort of thing. There were also a bunch of random dated objects around the store. I guessed that it was everything this older owner gathered over the years. Nothing really stood out to me. Until I looked in the leftmost corner of the store. There was a maroon colored jewelry box, and what was inside caught me completely off guard.



It was a necklace. A silver necklace with a golden heart charm. I looked on the back and it said ‘I love you most’. I looked down at my chest to see that my necklace is the exact same, other than the writing. Sure, I know it’s not one-of-a-kind or anything, but still, it’s weird to see in a pottery shop. From what I saw, it was the only piece of jewelry in the whole place. I brought the necklace up to the owner.



“Hey, do you know where you got this necklace?”



The old man examined it closely after putting on a small pair of prescription glasses.



“Hmm. Well, I’m not sure! Been living for many years, you see.” He put his index finger to his temple. “The thing up here ain’t working like it used to!” He let out a weak laugh.



I was interested in buying it. Just the thought of a necklace so similar to mine, and in a ceramics shop of all places, really sparked my interest.



“How much are you selling it for?”



The old man lifted the jewelry box to examine the price tag on the bottom.



“This beauty costs $30.”



It was surprisingly low, even for a small shop run by an old man. The one I got for my sister was at a jewelry store for $120. Even though the price for this imposter was incredibly low, I only brought $20 with me. I suspected that maybe I could haggle for it.



“You think I could take it for twenty?”



“I’m sorry young man, but I don’t negotiate. You could always come back tomorrow, I’ll be here, same time!”



I accepted, but was still annoyed that I’ll have to come back for it. I don’t know exactly why, but something was compelling me to get that necklace, I just couldn’t put my finger on it.



I left the store and rode home on my bike with the intention of coming back for it tomorrow. It was around 7:00 PM by the time I got home, still a couple hours before sundown. I didn’t want to call it a night just yet, so I racked my brain for anything to do. I remembered the backyard leading to the huge forest. I looked out the glass door to see a dirt path carved into the ground leading deep in the forest. I decided to make a turkey and cheese sandwich and took it with me as I made my way into the mass of trees. 



It was mostly peaceful, the sounds of birds chirping and leaves rustling all around me. The chill evening breeze cooled me off of the summer heat. The sound of my slow paced footsteps hitting the dirt path. As I looked around I noticed that most, if not all of the trees seemed to be centuries old. Loose pieces of bark falling off the wooden statues swaying in the wind. Peaking through the leaves blowing in the wind, I can see the sun near the horizon, accompanied by the deep orange sky. 



I was walking for about half an hour, my turkey sandwich already devoured, when everything seemed to go dead silent. The sound of leaves shaking in the breeze disappeared, the breeze itself dissipated into nothingness. It was almost as if all the birds had died in the sky, no longer making a single chirp. The sudden absence of sound caught me off guard and I stopped in my tracks. Looking around me, it was as if time stopped. The trees no longer creaked as they swung left to right, instead, they were frozen in place. Not even a single leaf caught my eye. 



That’s when I saw the figure standing about fifty feet in front of me on the dirt trail. Even at my 5’9” stature, he was several feet taller than me. I say he, but I have no clue what it is. It looked like the shape of a tall man, but it had no outstanding features, it had no features at all. Its entire body was pitch black, as if a shadow of a man was standing up on its own. It was imposing, and the moment I saw it, the energy I felt when I entered this town came back to me in a flash. Every hair on my body stood up at the sight of it. Even though it didn’t have eyes, or any facial features, I knew it was staring directly at me. 



I was able to tell that the thing turned its head to my right. I looked where he turned and I saw a deer. He was looking around towards the two of us cautiously, moving around sporadically. I looked back at the shadow creature to see its arm raising towards the animal. It slowly uncurled one of its fingers, and in doing so made the deer disappear in an instant. I jumped back in horror, wondering if I was dreaming or not. It slowly veered its head to look back at me, then vanished shortly after.



I didn’t know what to think. This couldn’t be real, maybe this was all in my head. Or maybe I was dreaming. I pinched my arm, no luck. After finally taking in what I just saw, I ran back towards the house as fast as I could. The sun was more than half way past the horizon and it was getting harder to see. I made it back to the house and locked the glass door behind me. I stood there looking out the glass for minutes, but nothing came. The trees were back to normal as they swung in the wind, leaves falling to the forest ground. After I realized that I was being crazy and nothing was coming for me, I realized that I desperately needed sleep. My eyes fluttered frequently, making it hard to keep my eyes open. I went up to my room, loosely set up my sheets and pillows on my new bed and flopped down on it. I made sure to take off my necklace and put it on the ground next to me. 



Next thing I knew, I drifted off to sleep. I was relieved, because that night, I didn’t have any nightmares of my sister and that fateful night. Instead, I had nightmares of that thing I saw in the forest. Making everything around me disappear into the void, leaving me and only me. I didn’t know what it wanted or why it was doing it. I just knew I needed answers.
