My name is Jonathan, what's yours?

My son's voice echoed through the house.

I turned off the TV and went to his room to see who he was talking to.

Hey bud, who are ya talking to?

My friend!

Friend?

Yes dad! Don't you see him?

No, I- I don't...

He's right there dad, he's playing with my toys!

I glanced at my son's toy box to see the toys moving by themselves, I grabbed my son and rushed out of the room

DAD! WHY DID YOU DO THAT?! Now Billy is crying!

I didn't speak a single word, I rushed to my bedroom, grabbed my car keys and we were out of the house.

I got in the car, put my son next to me, as I turned the car on and got ready to drive something caught my eye in the rear view mirror, I saw a shadowy figure in black robes glancing at us from my son's room through the window, you better belive me when I say I  STEPPED on that pedal, hell in a few minutes we were going 120 kilometers down the high way, hah! I never even knew my old rusty bucket of a car could go that fast.

It was 2 in the morning at the time we left the house so I really couldn't do a thing but stay in a hotel until we can sort this whole mess out.

We got to our hotel, booked a room and slept till 9, got up, ate breakfast and got in our car. We went to a church and got a priest to bless the house.

The man's name was brother Rob, little did he know going to that cursed house was a mistake that would cost him his life.

We got in the house and I took brother Rob to the room, I still can't get that horrific scene out of my head to this day... brother Rob opened the door and walked in the room, as soon as he put his foot inside that room his head blew up right infront of me and my 8 year old boy.

I sprinted out of the house with my son, got in the car and drove out of there, only this time the demon wasn't looking at us from the window, it was right behind us, day turned into night as I drove and this thing still followed us. My son started talking to me

Dad, why are you scared of Billy? He just wants to play with us!

I didn't know what to say, I just kept on driving until we seemed to have lost it, I did not know what to do. I couldn't sell the house and I couldn't live there, what do we do? Are we gonna stay on the street? Can the demon still find us?

I slept in my car that night with my son right next to me, I held him tight fearing that the thing might come for him.

Later that night I felt something grabbing my son and taking him from my arms, I woke up immediately when I saw it, itshideous face and its stretched limbs.

WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH US!!!!

I shouted..

It stayed quiet, it held my son in its arms and plucked his eyes out. I passed out...

I woke up in a bright room. I opened my eyes and it was standing right infront of me, it placed it's hands on my head and I passed out again...

I woke up in a house, I felt like I saw it before. Is this my old home?
