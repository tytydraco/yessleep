In prison, the last thing you want to do is ingest a bad batch of acid.

That said, you get what you get, and you don't get fucking upset, even if your entire existence is flipped upside down, turned inside out, and ripped to shreds right in front of your eyes... Right?

Maybe.

I'm no stranger to tripping. Acid, mushrooms, and DMT became my daily cocktail of choice during the pandemic, in various doses. Somehow, drugs hit a lot better when they were government funded. 

I've done more psychedelics than man was ever meant to withstand. I have watched on as reality falls apart, crumbles, and redefines the shattered tapestry of our little slice of the galaxy, on more than one occasion. 

The darkest corners of existence couldn't escape the burning light that brightens our universe, even if it threw it's body full force against the confines of our universe. The come down always happens. It is inevitable.

Yet sometimes, something slips through the cracks and enters our world through our minds and through realms and power we may never understand.

For me, that sometime came last Wednesday.

My guy on the outside sent me a care package. I remember feeling elated, on top of the fucking moon as I looked down upon a sheet of what was supposed to be some of the hardest hitting LSD to ever exist.

"It's pure, right from the source," he said. Whatever that meant, I didn't give a fuck. I wish I hadnpressed him for answers then and there.

That night at about 10 p.m., I dropped ten hits of that acid. Hardly my largest dose, but after being dry for awhile, I expected to be hit pretty hard. I waited five minutes. Then ten, and twenty. 

Nothing.  The ice cold air of the night propelled itself down the concrete halls and through the iron bars that keep me locked up like a dog, only to bring an indescribable shiver to my spine, dragging with it a dread I did not yet understand had nothing to do with my getting fucked over with some useless pieces of paper.

I cursed into the inky black shadows that conquered the corners of my cell, pissed at my dealer for bringing me some weak product. In an act of defiance and stupidity, I tore another bar of ten tabs from the sheet of paper and plopped them under my tongue.

One minute later, the voices started.

At first, I thought the guys in the cell next to me were whispering to each other. It was a gnawing sensation that slowly gripped the back of my mind. They weren't even saying words, just gibbering uncontrollably to each other. 

I got off my bed and went to grip the bars of my cell. I was going to tell them to shut the fuck up, but as I approached, I realized the sound was actually echoing down the long concrete hallway. 

The once familiar grey hall lined with barred cells looked... Off, to say the least. Far longer then I remembered them being. The acrid smell of iron penetrated my senses, making me gag for a moment.

Then it hit me. The visuals crept up on me without warning, no body high whatsoever beforehand. 

They were the fractals I usually saw when I was tripping hard, but with this menacing jagged and imposing structure to it, as if something distant was using my memories to paint a kaleidoscopic interpretation of what tripping might look like to a human. 

The longer I stared, the more details my mind picked up.

The fractals on the walls were oozing and shifting into elongated clumps of skin, with no rhyme or reason to their amorphous flesh except the vague resemblance of faces. Some were clearly humanlike, while others held qualities that could only be described as otherworldly.

Some had no eyes, but jagged and sharpened teeth that mashed viciously together with an insatiable hunger. The ones that did have eyes were all staring right at me. 

An amalgamation of human, animal, and unrecognizably alien eyes that pierced my very soul and mind like I was nothing more than hastily drawn concept art on some cosmic entity's sheet of scribble paper.

I tried desperately to calm my nerves with some deep breathing exercises. They always used to bring my mind back down from the ledge of infinite insanity when the drugs were kicking me in the head too hard. 

Now, it seemed to only escalate the situation as it dawned on me, to my grave dismay, the walls were breathing with me. Deep, purposeless breaths, like the very prison walls themselves were drawing in air for the express purpose of providing me with an uncontrollable mental break down.

It was working.

I began to pull at the bars, hoping the warped rules of reality would also apply to my own strength and actions. If I could only just peel them apart far enough for me to get a guard to send me to the psyche ward, then maybe they could help end this nightmarish hell that I found myself diving into head first, cascading deep into a nightmarish world of empty shadows and eyes and mouths.

I tried my best to push my face through the bars. If I could even just get a glimpse of another person, maybe it would all end up fine in the end. 

Even then, I knew better. 

Something was fundamentally wrong here. Whatever I took was now riding along in the darkest reaches of my soul. Memories of those I love began to fade and fall apart at the seams as I begged God to save me from myself.

As my face stretched back, my head pushing forward into the bars, I felt a slip and heard a sickening squelch, like flesh melting into metal. My head popped through the impossibly narrow gap between the now rust and blood covered iron that kept me locked in my cage of cold, uncaring stone.

In a frenzied panic, I tried to pull my head back through the bars. They squeezed tightly on either side of my neck, causing me to choke in their freezing cold grasp. The faces chittered and jeered louder as the concrete walls slowly transformed into pasty yellow flesh that writhed with every move I made.

The more I moved and struggled, the tighter the metal bars became. As I swung my head left and right, I could see the other cells were all empty. I was alone, save for the fleshy demonic faces that were now peeling themselves from the walls with agonizing expressions permeating their now impossibly structured faces.

The rotted fleshy substance that became the surface of the prison's inner chambers fought to keep the many shaplmbling forms from escaping, as if it understood that the sights unfolding before me were entirely unnatural to this realm.

Frantically, uncontrollably, I shook my head from side to side, both searching for help and rejecting this new reality. If I could just get someone, anyone...

Then I saw it.

At the end of the now impossibly long hall of iron and flesh, a pure black form begins writhing and clawing it's way across the flesh and vein covered floor. The being was hard to decipher from a distance, and I had no interest in getting a good look at the thing that could create all of this chaos.

I pulled my body as hard as I could, the bars causing my neck to crackle with the pressure as my animalistic instincts screamed within, begging for some sort of solution to the madness I found myself being buried alive in. The fiery hot pain in my throat was becoming unbearable.

As I struggled for my life, the sluggish mass of blackened flesh and dried blood approached,  finally revealing it's jet black form up close and under a light that flickered wildly as the impossible being inches it's way closer, and closer.

It's wriggling mass stopped just feet away down the hallway as the flesh faces tried to pull themselves away with their jaws and flailing movements and blood curdling screams of agony, whispers of deceit, their cries for mercy... The smell of rot and decay was so strong that I had to stifle the bile plunging up into my throat.

In the black form, a maw of impossible size opens up into three sections, splitting like some sort of horrible monstrous mandible. Rows and rows of arm-length teeth freely rotated around the mouth like a vortex of bloodied daggers, and a sickly sour smell erupts from the depths of its bowels, or innards, or whatever such a being would contain. It's form kept morphing from fractals to extremely intricate shapes, back to fractals.

Those damn fractals...

Blobs of flesh begin tearing in strips from both the walls and the faces that were trying to escape. Their eyes all stare me down, a pitiful and visceral fear scrawled across their features. The world around me began to melt as I realized my face had begun to slosh and slide off of my body. 

I screamed for help at the top of my lungs until what felt like searing hot liquid began to fill them to the brim. It felt like magma was pouring onto my head and pulling the humanity out of my spirit and out of my every breath.

My sight breaks into fractals as I feel my essence being ripped from my very body. I splattered against the flesh covered ground, now just a piece of my former self. As if gravity itself shifted to pull me in, what's left of me was slowly dripping into the splintering maw's gaping jaws. As my consciousness faded into the black abyss, I got one last look at my body.

It hung lifelessly from between the bars by the throat, the head no longer waving side to side. The body slumps to the ground, hopeless and shivering, as the last teeth slide my formless flesh into it's vile gullet.

I slammed my eyes shut, and everything went completely black and still, save for the sounds of what I can only guess to be digestive fluids melting me alive, shooting an unshakable hot pain through my nerves and into my psyche and soul. 

After centuries of imperceptible suffering and pressure, I finally heard a voice of what can only be described as the lingering lifeblood of every evil soul, every fallen angel to ever travel the universe. What it said to me will never leave my mind.

"You brought yourself here."

Then, in an instant, I was being shaken and slapped by one of the guards, his features petrified by the ramblings pouring forth from my mouth with the fluidity of melted wax. More guards entered briskly, flooding in with a stretcher to transport me to the infirmary.

It's been almost a week and a half. Every day, that thing comes back to me in a different form. The world around me shifts constantly. I no longer connect with humans, as if part of my soul was forever changed by what happened that day. 

In my dreams, the splintering maw communes with me, tells me to expand others' realities so that I may not suffer alone when the end days of armageddon finally arrive. It will devour us all, one by one, and we will be wrenched violently from our fragile existence, kicking and screaming every  inch of the eternal journey into the abyss itself.

The fragile psyche of human kind is only truly apparent once the veil has been lifted. For me, it has revealed humanity is hardly the darkest entity in all of creation, despite our best efforts to claw our way into evil's heart and wield it as our own.

I leave this message as a warning, and a bid for forgiveness. I just put the rest of those cursed tablets in the water pumps below the prison, in an attempt to appease the Splintering Maw. 

I only wish for mercy as I wait for the poison to work it's magical properties within my veins, freeing me from this horrible plane of existence. 

And the worst part? It was right. I brought myself here. We brought ourselves here.

May God save your souls.
