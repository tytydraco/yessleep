I have always been one in communion with nature, the occult, the supernatural. I read my horoscopes daily (they’re always so frickin' accurate???) and frequently create spells and other concoctions to bring about positive vibes, well… unless you piss me off. Look, it’s not my fault I put a hex on my UberEats driver for being a few minutes late. I was really hungry and they seemed to not realize they were serving Agatha Nightshade! What hex did I give them? The one called *NO TIP! TIP RESCINDO!*

Because I dabble with the dark so often, I light sage in my apartment every few hours, even if it sets off the smoke alarms and my neighbors complain (ugh… like… I’m trying to ward off spirits here???).

Anyways, I have an up-and-coming TikTok account where I give tips and lessons about being a TikTok witch, but lately, my content has dried up. I don’t have much to say about mercury being in retrograde or how to augment your aura because I’ve said it all already! I’m tired of making moon water! I’ve done so many tutorials about charging crystals that I feel like no one cares anymore, especially when I tried that spell where I advised people to supercharge them in their microwaves which I guess caused some explosions?? Look, it’s magic, people. You can’t always predict what will happen!

Like do you guys remember in 2020 when WitchTok cast a spell on the moon to bring about bad luck and things just never stopped being like… *major ick*?? The vibes… never recovered!

Anyway, I was walking home after my shift at Jersey Mike’s, looking at my phone and subtly throwing shade at other WitchTokers with my second account, only meant for trolling, when I came across a worker from my local animal shelter panting in the back alley by the shelter door. They were covered in scratches and bruises and bleeding from their ear which seemed to have a piece missing. The blood extended to their apron and streaked across the “*DOG SANCTUARY*” logo.

“Whoa,” I said. “Isn’t it a bit early for a Halloween costume?”

The lady jumped at the sound of my voice. “T-T-The dog in there,” she stammered. “He’s… out of control. Like… they’re not a normal dog.”

She held up a hand and I could see blood spurting from a partially missing finger. I suddenly got their Halloween costume. They were dressed as a shelter-worker that had also been mauled by a dog! I laughed because it seemed way too on the nose. It would like me showing up to work tomorrow dressed up as Jersey Mike’s employee that had been stabbed by a sub sandwich. Actually, that could be genius. I filed it away into my memory for later.

I ignored the obviously fake prosthetic spurting blood on the sidewalk and on my shoes and asked the shelter worker more about the dog. Like… was it up for adoption?

They looked at me like I was insane, but then their eyes seemed to light up a little. “F-Free…” they muttered. “Just take the dog.”

“No cap!?” I said.

Well, I always wanted a dog! I thought about all the cute and adorbs content I could make with them. If they were a really rude dog, then I could easily correct that by casting a spell of pacification with some cinnamon sticks, cream of wheat, and a dash of aged rosemary. This was going to give me content a HUGE BOOST. People frickin’ love dogs, especially when they’re needy rescues.

The worker led me into the back room of the shelter where a dog was yapping its head off. The dog was a small corgi, covered in brown and black spots, the absolute cutest! The fur around the dog’s mouth appeared to be red and I wondered why the shelter-worker let it drink so much fake blood. Corn syrup couldn’t have been good for a dog but it’s also like… I’m not a vet, lol.

“Oh wow, look at the heckin’ pupperino!” I said. The lady, terrified as she seemed, appeared to cringe and die a little inside as I said this.

“Y-You have to… sign his contract,” she said. “Or else… he’ll keep coming back… I thought we… put him down but he kept… biting… biting at my toes and fingers until-“ She held up her bloody stump that was now wrapped in a white towel, going on red. “He also ate… ate the mailman…”

“**Shmorshifir oordic van shizor tiel zifel zalomen urcanis**,” said the dog in an impossibly deep voice that made my ears hurt a little, then licked his red-stained chops.

I know what you’re thinking. Shouldn’t I have been scared? Well, there’s something you have to understand about me. I’m a witch and I’m always *always* incredibly high on weed and other hallucinogens, like the mushrooms I foraged from my apartment’s basement. The ones that grow behind the washer? Those really get me *jonesin'* beyond the fade. So I couldn’t be 100% sure if what I was seeing was reality or y’know, just magic. Dogs are also really getting smart these days, so it only seemed like a matter of time before they would start talking anyways.

This shelter worker also seemed like a total diva. I just knew she was exaggerating and trying to get out of work early to go trick or treating or something, even though she was super old and probably in her 30s. The dog might have chewed on the mailman a bit, but there was no way this little doggo ate him, shoes, bones, mail bag and all!

While I was signing the papers, the dog appeared to levitate past us. The shelter worker looked up anxiously, her face the color of fresh snow. She was biting her nails on the hand not wearing the prosthetic and kept making the sign of the cross.

The shelter worker said his name tag read *Balthazar*, but I thought that was major ick, not cute vibes, so I renamed him to Barklazar. Isn’t that so adorable!?

She gave me a food and water bowl for free (!) and a leash and some dog toys, and as soon as I walked out, locked the door and turned off the lights.

When we got back to my apartment, I realized I didn’t have any dog food, so I took Little Barklazar for a car ride.

He started barking in the backseat, but eventually the barking turned into a sort of human cadence. I’d heard of the dog whisperer before, but never thought it was totes a legit thing!

“**Human**,” the dog said in a booming, cavernous voice. A voice so deep I could feel the windows of my car shake like the bass at the dankest rave you’ve never been to. Let’s not pretend you’ve ever been invited to one... (:/). “**I require sustenance. Take me to the nearest drive-through, or I will eat you.**”

I could hardly believe myself and the dog were hitting it off so well! I pulled into Mickey D’s and asked the guy working if there was something little Barklazar could snack on.

“Uhh,” replied the guy on the intercom. “I have no idea, ma’am, we don’t serve animals.”

“**Bring me to the window and hold me up**,” said Barklazar. “**I wish to eat this man**.”

“Barklazar!” I said. “We don’t chew on people that are alive, okay? Totes not the vibe. Like… read the room, dude???” Barklazar said nothing, but I could see his shrewd puppy eyes glaring at me. Almost looked sort of red? I booped his bloody snoot though and that seemed to calm him down (:D).

Barklazar leaned out the window and started chanting again, like he had at the dog shelter. I’m guessing it was Pig Latin or something? I’m not a nerd.

The worker ended up handing me a bunch of food for free which was so kind! I tried to remove the buns from the meat to make the food healthier, but Barklazar nipped at my fingers and growled at me. Then he seemed to unhinge his jaw and inhaled everything in the back seat, wrappers and all. I think he ate about 40 sandwiches, 40 chicken nuggets, and one large diet coke that was supposed to be for me (:/).

Anyway, Little Barklazar has been running around on the ceiling since we got home, and it seems like he’s scratched some sort of star into the ceiling. I can only imagine it’s some sort of protective sigil! Does anyone else have advice about being a first-time pet owner or ideas for vids I should throw up on the Tok? Man, I don’t know why, but Barklazar is also starting to smell REALLY BAD. Like fermented gym socks. Gonna have to bathe this little dude right away! OH, I should def order some cute outfits for him from the ‘Zon as well. Imagine if I put a little wizard hat on him? Def could be a vibe. A total mood.
