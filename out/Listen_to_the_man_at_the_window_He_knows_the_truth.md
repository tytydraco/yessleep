I woke up with a start, my heart pounding in my chest. The room was cloaked in darkness, the only light filtering in through the gaps in the curtains. I glanced at the clock on my bedside table. It read 1:00 am. It was that time again. The time when the tapping on my window would begin.  
  
For weeks now, I had been tormented by a humanoid figure that would appear every night, tapping insistently on my window. Its skeletal fingers drumming against the glass echoed in the stillness of the night. Each night, it would whisper to me, a chilling voice that wormed its way into my mind.  
  
"They're not who they say they are. Your parents are hiding something."  
  
At first, I dismissed it as a prank or a figment of my imagination. But as the nights went on, doubts began to seep into my consciousness. What if there was some truth to those words? What if my parents were hiding something from me? I had never questioned their identities before, never thought twice about who they really were.  
  
With a trembling hand, I reached for my phone and turned to the all-knowing oracle, Google. I typed in my parents' names, expecting to find a trove of information confirming their existence. But to my bewilderment, there was nothing. No social media profiles, no articles, no proof that they had ever existed beyond my own memories.  
  
Panic gripped me as I searched for my own name. Again, there was nothing. No digital footprint, no evidence that I had ever lived. It was as if I were a ghost, erased from the annals of the internet. My breath came in short gasps as I stumbled out of bed and made my way to the window.  
  
Summoning the courage, I pulled back the curtains, peering into the darkness outside. The moon hung low in the sky, casting an eerie glow over the world. But as my eyes adjusted to the dim light, I began to notice something peculiar. Faults in the fabric of reality itself.  
  
The streetlights flickered intermittently, their glow wavering in and out of existence. Shadows twisted and elongated, dancing with a life of their own. The once-familiar houses seemed distorted, their angles askew. It was as if I had stepped into a nightmare, a world that was slowly unravelling.  
  
Fear consumed me, and a new thought entered my mind. What if this was all a simulation? A glitch in the system? I stumbled backward, my mind spinning with questions and uncertainties. Was any of this real? Were my parents real? Was I real?  
  
Days blurred into nights as I grappled with my crumbling reality. The world around me continued to warp and distort, the glitches growing more pronounced. Every day, I searched for answers, desperate to understand what was happening. But the internet remained silent, offering no solace or explanation.  
  
Then, in a moment of clarity, I realized that I needed to seek help. The only place I could turn to was a laboratory nearby, renowned for its ground-breaking research in the field of consciousness. I walked through the hallowed halls, my footsteps echoing in the sterile silence.  
  
Inside the lab, two scientists stood hunched over a table, their eyes fixed on three glass jars containing floating brains. The sight sent shivers down my spine, but I knew I had to press on.  
  
"I need your help," I pleaded, my voice quivering. "I think I'm living in a simulation. Everything is falling apart."  
  
The scientists exchanged glances, their expressions grave. One of them turned to me, a mix of sympathy and trepidation in their eyes.  
  
"We know," they said softly. "We've been monitoring you. We believe YOUR brain in this jar, has become too aware, too self-aware. It's realizing the nature of its existence, and it's destabilizing the simulation."  
  
A surge of terror shot through me as I looked at the brain in the jar. One of them twitched, its neural connections firing erratically. The scientist continued, their voice tinged with sorrow.  
  
"We have no choice. We must terminate it, reset the simulation. It's the only way to maintain the integrity of the program."  
  
A wave of despair washed over me as the scientist reached for a button, their finger poised to initiate the brain's destruction. I tried to scream, to protest, but no sound escaped my lips. The button was pressed, and with a flash of blinding light, the brain ceased to exist.  
  
The world around me disintegrated into a maelstrom of chaos, collapsing upon itself like a shattered illusion. And in that moment, I understood. I was never real. My parents were never real. We were nothing more than fragments of data in a simulated universe.  
  
As the simulation reset, I found myself back in my bed, the clock reading 1:00 am. The tapping on my window began anew, and the whispers echoed in my ears. But this time, I knew the truth. We were all trapped in a never-ending cycle of existence, forever tormented by the knowledge that we were nothing more than lines of code, doomed to repeat our lives over and over again.  
  
And as the tapping grew louder, I closed my eyes, praying for release from this simulated nightmare, hoping against hope that one day, the cycle would break, and I would be free.
