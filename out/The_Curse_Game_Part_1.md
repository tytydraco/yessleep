  
We were having lunch in some restaurant that looked vaguely Italian. I’d forgotten the name by the time we went through the doors. A waiter had escorted us to a table in a dimly lit corner. I guess we didn’t look like locals, since she instantly spoke English to us. My phone was laying on the table when its screen lit up with a text from Chrissie.



\> sooo. hows the lads trip goin?



I didn’t like it when she called it a lads trip. Made it sound like we were some chavs from up north who’d come to drink and treat the place like an adults-only playground. But I guess there was some truth to it–we were lads, and we did do quite a bit of drinking.



\> all good! having some lunch. not sure what the plan is yet for today. maybe just fuck around until we find something cool to do. 



I took a sip of my beer. Somehow it was already my third one of the day. That made me feel a bit self-conscious (am i an alcoholic?), but then again, we were on a trip and the beer was cheap as hell. Chrissie wasn’t online anymore, so I put my phone down and tried to catch up with whatever Case and Trevor were talking about.



“Just saying, we could get there early for cheap. Then just wait until the chicks start rolling in,” Trevor was saying.



“You’re the only one who needs chicks,” Case said, turning to me with that fucking-around smile of his. His facial expressions seemed to only go between a blank slate that seemed like he hated everything, and that weird smile where you weren’t sure if he was masking irreverence or actually enjoying himself more than anyone had ever before in the history of humankind. It was like a ying-yang, except you only saw one half at a time. “Me and Luke are happy in our partnerships. Isn’t that right?”



“Damn right,” I said. My phone buzzed and lit up again, but I didn’t look at it.



“So we’re not going to just be your wingmen at some shifty fucking club all night. I mean, you’re welcome to go by your lonesome, but you’ll be battling against the fine men of Budapest for the attention of said chicks. And I’m not saying you’re not a handsome lad yourself, but…”



“But that’s why I need you guys with me,” Trevor cut in, smiling. “Between you two, I’ll look like a Scandinavian Hunk.”



“More like Scandinavian Hulk,” Case said. We all laughed, even though Trevor looked nothing like Hulk. 



We’d known each other since we were teenagers. Our group used to be bigger, but life happened, and people took different routes. It was kind of amazing that the three of us were still so tight. But it also felt so natural, like it couldn’t be any other way. 



Everyone sipped on their beers for a while, texting whomever. Me and Case our girlfriends back home. Trevor to whoever had matched with him on whatever dating app people used these days. 



“So,” I said, and waited for the guys to put their phones down. “There’s this antiques shop I might wanna check out.”



“Sounds interesting,” Case said.



“Yeah. It’s not too far from here. Just a little walk. The reviews were good.”



“Any particular reason for going there?” Trevor asked.



“I wanna get something for Chrissie. Something that’s not some stupid fridge magnet.”



“Hey, good idea,” Case said. “Might do that too.”



Trevor sighed. “Fine. But then we’ll go do something actually fun.”



After paying for our meals, I escorted our little group to the shop. It was located on a busy street filled with restaurants, but down a flight of stairs. The inside was halfway underground, the windows lining the upper edge of the walls like a basement. Well, it was technically a basement, I guess. 



The cashier greeted us with a mumbling of words in their native language. When we replied with an amiable *Hello!* in chorus, they simply smiled and returned with a well-rehearsed *hello* back to us.



We politely rummaged and giggled our way through the store, picking up weird books and lamps and pointing at the many paintings on the walls. That’s until Case found something and went “Whoa,” uncomfortably loud, like a stoner taking a hit of some really good weed.



“Whatcha got there?” I asked as I made my way to him. 



He was holding a stone statue, two palms tall and a fist’s width. It was dark, but not exactly a uniform black, more like black paint that had chipped off, revealing speckles of red underneath.  Looking at the ragged and haphazardly cut edges, it was definitely hand-carved. Like either the stone was so dense and hard it’d been difficult to crack pieces off it, or the maker had made it in haste. The latter seemed ridiculous, but somehow not totally unbelievable.



The form itself consisted of a creature with long limbs, and a torso like a bag of railroad spikes. Its head was an oval, with a sharp jaw and two eyes that sunk in like puddles inside a dark warehouse. Some sort of horns, long and almost stringy, reached from its head towards the sky, separating into strands that prodded at the air like tiny knives.



Something about it gave me a bad vibe. Made my stomach twist ever so slightly, and a headache began to form at the back of my head.



“Now this is a cursed fucking object if I’ve ever seen one,” Case said, turning the statue carefully in his hands, like he was afraid to break it. 



“Yeah, that’s bad vibes central. Wouldn’t want to bring that back on the plane, or we’d end up on the fucking Lost island.”



“Uhh, spoilers,” Trevor said, appearing next to Case like a ghost.



“That’s not a spoiler. It’s literally the whole premise of the show,” I said.



“Still.”



“Wonder how much it costs,” Case said, his attention firmly on the statue.



“Anything’s too much,” I said, but he was already off to the cashier. Me and Trevor followed, exchanging a look. His was confused, mine concerned. I’m not sure he got why.



“Hello,” Case said again to the cashier. “This statue here, I’d like to buy it. How much is it?”



“Is there a price on it?” they said.



“I can’t see one,” he said, handing it to the cashier, who inspected it from top to bottom. I was trying to see if something changed in their face, if they reacted to the statue as I had. Either they didn’t, or they were simply too focused on the job at hand to give a shit.



The cashier made a sound like *hmm*, and put the statue on the counter. “No price on it. Is fifteen euros good?”



“I’ll take it,” Case said, turning to us with that shit-eating grin. Like he’d just made a huge score.



Case insisted on going by the hotel to drop the stone statue off before we headed out further. I didn’t really feel like backtracking, and thankfully Trevor was insistent that we’d go to a pub just the two of us and Case could catch up. So we parted ways, and Trevor promised to send Case our location once we’d settled somewhere.



The rest of the night was much like all the other nights we’d had in Budapest. Going to different pubs, trying out some more-or-less interesting food, politely gawking at the dissimilarities and similarities between this new country and the country we’d come from and grown up in. Case took his sweet time joining us, but I figured he’d just taken the opportunity to have a wank back at the hotel. God knows I would’ve. He had a plaster on his wrist when he came back though, which gave me the somewhat funny idea in my mind that he’d stroked himself to a chafe.



We were all pretty tired once we got back to our AirBnB, Trevor somehow getting more drunk as he tried to brush his teeth. Or maybe just really tired. Anyway, he finally stumbled his way to the pullout couch in the living room, wearing nothing but boxers and a hoodie, and promptly started snoring facedown. I nudged him to his side so he wouldn’t be breathing through the couch all night.



“You know,” Case said from the kitchen. “I think that thing really is cursed.”



“The statue?” I asked, making my way to the fridge for a bottle of water. Case was leaning against the countertop, a glass of coke in his hand. It may or may not have had some rum in it–he liked to drag his nights out and start his days late.



“I did some sleuthing when I brought it back here. Apparently, it depicts some old creature that used to haunt people.”



“Oh yeah?” I said.



“The story goes,” he said, taking a dramatic sip. “The creature could be beckoned by a witch to stalk a person. Or more like a family, I guess, since that was how it was mostly described. Anyway, the witch would get a piece of hair, strap it to some piece of wood they got from the family’s house, and drench the whole thing in blood. Then they’d lay the bloody stick in the woods, and the creature would come, take its scent, and hunt the family.”



“And then what?”



“Then it would kill whoever’s blood was on the stick, I guess. The stories were basically–” and he put on his best-bad Hungarian accent, “The creature would go to the family home, pillage and draw blood, slay the young and old, and finish before the morning came. When the sun came up, they would be found dead.”



“Well. Cool,” I said. Something in his eyes was bothering me. He wasn’t smiling, but I could feel a grin creeping up behind his retinas, like he was about to pounce on me like a predator.



“It is,” Case said. “And you know what I thought would be fun?”



“What?”



“To test it out.”



“Uhh, what?”



He slowly lifted the glass to his lips, then chugged the rest of his drink in one big gulp. 



“Yeah. Just, you know, seeing if it's real. I got some of your hair and cracked off a piece of wood from the skirting and… bled on it a little bit.”



Anger plumped up behind my throat, burning like alcohol. “Case… what the fuck?” 



“Don’t worry! The skirting was already coming off, and I just took a little piece. No one will know.”



“It’s not that,” I said. The words came out louder than I wanted them to, so I made a mental note to keep it down. Not because of Trevor, even–he wouldn’t wake up if a bomb went off–but because I didn’t want to sound too harsh. “It’s the fact that you just took my hair, put it around some stick and fucking bled on it. Isn’t that a bit fucking weird to you?”



He thought for a moment, or pretended to. “Yeah, I guess. Sorry. I thought it’d be funny.”



“Jesus, Case. Well… it’s not. Where is it?”



He smiled sorry, and a wave of tiredness hit me then. The whole conversation just dropped a ball of lead inside me, and I was too tired and too drunk to continue it. Whatever I would’ve said wouldn’t have come out the way I wanted it to, and I was sure Case would feel like an idiot in the morning anyway. But I felt like ripping into him, but knew that wasn’t the right choice. I didn’t want to ruin the trip.



“Look, it’s fine. Let’s just go to bed, okay?” I said. 



Case put his glass in the sink. “Alright. Just thought you’d find it funny, but sorry anyway.”



“Sure.”



Case was sleeping in the master bedroom on the other side of the house, and I had the smaller one next to the kitchen. Case had really wanted the bigger room, and I didn’t really understand the point of having a lot of space when we’re just staying for a week anyway.



Case went to the bathroom while I brushed my teeth in the kitchen. When he came out, I asked him again where he’d put the stick. *The bloody, stolen-hair stick*, I thought, but didn’t say.



“Oh, it’s in the drawer in your nightstand. Sorry, I’ll come and get it.”



I waved him off. “It’s fine. I’ll throw it out.”



“You sure?” he asked, some disappointment in his eyes. Maybe the weirdness of what he’d done had finally sunk in a bit.



“Yeah. Night.”



“Night,” he said, and went to his room.



The stick was exactly where he’d said it would be. It looked a bit silly, with the ripped-off skirting having one side painted white, and the other a pale, splintering wood. The hairs were few and far between, lazily tied around it, and some dried drops of blood were splattered along it. It looked like someone had had the unfortunate idea of using the stick of wood as a makeshift dildo. 



I grabbed it with a piece of paper and threw it in the bin, making sure the paper covered it so I wouldn’t have to see it the next time I opened it.



When I lay in bed, the whole thing kept me awake. The tiredness I’d felt had gotten lost somewhere along the way. I thought Case saying he was sorry and me throwing the thing away would give me enough resolve to sleep through the night.



I opened up my phone and responded to Chrissie’s message: “Have fun!!” and started Googling. 



It took a while to find the exact creature he’d referred to. I had to first use basic terms to find the general idea of it, then copy-pasted some Hungarian terms that led me to some old, historical sites that had no references or outside links. I had to translate everything, so the English was a bit shoddy. But one of the sites had a picture of a very similar looking statue, and a wall of plain text in a too-small font underneath it. I started reading it.



It seemed that Case was more-or-less right about the creature and the legend. Where the story had come from–or what it meant–the website didn’t say. And all it had to say about the statue itself was that whoever had found it thought it was from the 1550s. 



I heard a click, and then the slow, whiny buzz of my door sliding open. My heart almost jumped out of my chest, and I stood up from the bed. My door was slightly ajar, with the hallway and kitchen beyond veiled by a sliver of darkness.



The pumping of blood in my ears quickly subsided. It was probably just Trevor, getting up to piss but opening the wrong door by accident. The crime fit the perp.



I checked my phone. It was almost four in the morning. I threw it back on the bed, breathed in quickly and slowly out, and walked up to the door. 



All the lights were off, and just the faint flecks of moonlight shone through the cheap curtains behind Trevor. He was sleeping soundly, huffing with each breath like he was about to start snoring. Nothing seemed amiss, but an oppressive feeling crept up my neck. Not exactly the feeling of being watched, but someone seeing me when I couldn’t see them.



When I took a step outside my door, I hit my foot on something hard. I almost yelped, but kept it to a long inhale through my teeth as I cursed in my mind. 



The shape was easy to make out even in the dim light. 



It was the fucking statue. 



Anger bellowed within me, instantly conjuring up ways to get back at Case. Or at least yell at him. He’d thought it’d be so fucking funny to keep the prank, or whatever this was in his mind, going. And now I got a fucking bruised pinkie toe that hurt to walk on. I stormed into his room and opened the door. I’m not sure if he’d been sleeping or not, but the room was dark as he sat up and turned his bedside light on.



“What the fuck dude?” I yelled.



“What?” he said, blinking at the bright light, a confused look on his face.



“Don’t fucking be like that. Just fucking stop.”



“Stop what?” he yelled back.



I had to take a breath not to simply start yelling, forgetting to use actual words. As I exhaled, I could feel my toe swelling up, which mad it harder not to just fucking slap him.



“The statue. Outside my door. You *know* what I’m fucking talking about.”



“Uhh. I actually don’t? The statue’s in my bag last I checked. I wrapped it up in a towel.”



“Well why is it outside my fucking door, then?”



“Is it?”



I grunted and turned to walk out. “Let’s have a look then, shall we?”



He followed right behind me. I turned on the kitchen lights on the way. Trevor didn’t seem to notice the change in light. Or the yelling.



“Look,” I said.



“I didn’t put that there.” 



His face was red, and his eyes glassy. “I didn’t put that there,” he repeated.



“Well who the fuck did?”



“Uhm. Trevor? You? I don’t fucking know. But dude, I swear on my mother this wasn’t me. I got the message, okay. I’m not fucking with you. This isn’t me.”



I looked him in the eyes, and he stared back, unblinking. If he was lying, he was doing a really good job.



“Okay. Okay, fine. So what happened, then?”



He looked around. “You didn’t hear anything else? Someone coming in?”



“Like someone breaking in, sneaking into your room, quietly taking the statue from your bag, then sneaking their way back and placing it behind my door?”



“You know what I mean.”



“Well,” I said. “The door opened.”



“What do you mean it opened?” There was concern in his eyes now. He looked down the hall at the front door.



“I mean it opened. Just a bit, you know. Like someone was there. I thought it was you.”



Case took off to the front door. He turned the lights on, checking the door, the locks, and I guess for any muddy footprints on the ground, judging by the way his head was twisting and turning.



“Are you *sure* you didn’t hear anything else?” he said. “Because Occam’s razor isn’t giving me the best options right now.”



“I’m sure. And what do you mean?”



“Well, either Trevor did it, which we both know he didn’t. Or the weirdest stalker ever with extraordinary capabilities came in and did the best prank in the history of pranks. Or…”



“Or what?”



He shrugged the tiniest bit and turned himself away from me. “Or there’s something to that curse.”



“Oh.” I said. “You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me.”



He turned and lifted his arms in surrender and looked straight into my eyes. “I swear on anything and everything, this wasn’t me. We’ve been friends for a long time, and I know I can be a bit unpredictable. A dick, I guess, sometimes. But I fucking swear, I *promise*. This. Wasn’t. Me.”



I looked at him, then back down the hallway to the statue.



“Uhh, dude?”



“What?”



“Where’s the statue?”



I was hoping it was a trick of the light. Or maybe we’d picked it up in fervor and just forgot. But nope, it was just *gone*.



“Dude… what the fuck,” Case said.



Something between fear and rage overtook me, and as if in defiance of whatever powers were playing with me–earthly or something else entirely– I stomped back down the hall, swaying my head from side to side, checking to see what had happened. Hoping to find some logical explanation. 



I didn’t see it anywhere. Trevor snored, and at that point it felt wrong to keep him dreaming. Something was happening, and he should know. And maybe–just maybe–he’d just been pulling the prank of a lifetime all this time.



“Trevor! Wake up,” I said, shaking him by his shoulder.



“Uhh, what? What?” he groveled, halfway asleep. “What’s going on?”



“Something really fucking weird,” I said.



“What *weird*?”



“Well,” I said, pausing for a moment for Trevor’s eyes to focus. “The statue that Case bought from the antique store, it’s not here. I mean it was here, and then it moved, and now it’s not there anymore. Or where it was. It moved.”



Trevor sat up and rubbed his knuckles on his eyes, then sighed. “So… Case is fucking with you.”



“It’s not me,” Case said, walking up next to us. “I fucking swear dude.”



“You swear on anything, anywhere, anytime.”



“Listen,” I said, coming between them, and looking into Trevor’s eyes. “If this is Case’s doing, he’s got a whole fucking team doing it, and with the precision of fucking Catwoman. I’ve been with him the whole time. He’s not fucking with me, not this time.”



Trevor stood up, looked around the room. He looked quite silly just in his boxers and hoodie, obviously trying to figure out the level of worried he should be. How dire the situation was.



He nodded. “Well, fuck. I knew that something was wrong with that fucking thing. So, what do we do?”



“We look for the statue, I guess,” I said.



“Shouldn’t we, like, fuck off from here?”



“We’re not gonna fuck off because of a ghost,” Case butted in. 



“Well, it’s not technically a ghost. It’s a fucking weird, lanky creature that’s supposedly out to kill me,” I said.



“Kill you?” Trevor asked.



“Yeah. It’s a whole thing. I’ll tell you later. Case isn’t fucking with us, but he definitely fucked up.”



“What the fuck, Case?”



“Dude,” Case said. “Let’s just fucking deal with this, okay. I thought it’d be funny.”



“You thought cursing your friend with some fucked-up Hungarian statue would be *funny*?”



“Guys!” I yelled and clapped my hands, which got their attention. “Let’s just figure out what to do, and beat each other's asses later, okay?”



They both grumbled something like an agreement. 



We spent the rest of the night looking for the statue, going through every corner. Turning pillows, looking inside the actual pillowcases, moving furniture. We gave the gist of what Case had done and the whole story about the creature to Trevor while we were at it.



The place looked like we’d been robbed by the time we gave up. The sun was starting to come up, bathing the apartment in a gleeful yellow, tamped by the curtains and drawn blinds.



We all sat down on the couch, tired and annoyed. At least those feelings, and the simple act of doing something with a purpose and nothing else weird happening, made the initial fear and anger subside a bit. Like it was all a bad dream. Something I could tell at campfires as a ghost story.



“So, it's not here,” I said.



“Duh,” Case said. I gave him a look: *you don’t get to say that.*



“What else can we do?”



“Well,” Trevor said, his eyes already halfway shut. “Maybe nothing. I mean, this supposed creature hasn’t come and eaten your insides. All that’s happened is some creepy shit, and now that creepy shit’s missing.”



“Maybe,” I said, but that didn’t mean I could sleep the next night without some pills to accompany the booze. 



“Occam’s razor,” Case said. “With what we know, Trevor is probably more-or-less right. Besides, my brain’s too mushy and hungover to think of anything else at this point.”



“I’d still like to do something.”



Case made a face, and his eyes burrowed into me. “Do what?”



“Hey, you have no fucking right to be mad at me,” I said, then took a breath. “Can we… I dunno. Undo the curse?”



Case shrugged. “I dunno.”



“Well, fucking Google it,” Trevor said. “Jesus, couldn’t either of you have come up with this like, two hours ago?”



Case lifted up his middle finger at Trevor, but he had the tiniest smile on him. “Fuck you.” He took out his phone, the bags under his eyes extra dark in the blue light.



Trevor fell asleep soon after, still sitting up. Case was still reading, until he said “Oh.”



“Oh?” I asked.



“So I went from the site that had the thing about the creature and searched for whatever came up. Anyway, according to the lore of the time, to get rid of a curse given to you by a witch… you need to curse the witch back.”



“Ooh-kay. That sounds way too easy.”



“I mean, yes and no. Back then the regular people were so against all the black magic or whatever that, were they to do a curse, it’d basically mean exile or death. That you’re one of the witches, y’know. Plus, I’m assuming it needs to be a real curse.”



“Well, I’m not a villager from the year fifteen-fucking-fifty-two, so I’m not going to get killed for being witchy. And I don’t mind cursing you.”



“What?” Case said, finally putting his phone down.



“Let’s just figure out a curse. A *real* curse. You know, something that’s not too bad. And then I’ll curse you, and you’ll deal with it, and that’s that.”



“I don’t want to get cursed.”



“Well, me either, but I didn’t even get to choose that, did I?”



“It’s probably not even a real curse,” Case said. He reminded of a kid throwing a tantrum.  “Nothing’s gonna happen.”



“How do you know? Besides, how would you know if the curse I’d put on you wouldn’t be the same? Just some bumps in the night and you’re sorted, and then we’d both be fine.”



Case straightened out his spine and stretched his shoulders wide. “Look, man. I don’t think it’s cool of you to go and curse me with whatever. I’m not okay with that.”



“Well I’m not okay with you already cursing me! Are you hearing yourself?”



“How was I supposed to know if it was real?”



“You bled on a fucking stick and stole my hair! What the fuck do you mean?”



“This is stupid,” Case said, and got up to leave.



“What, you’re just walking away?”



“Dude, let’s just talk this through in the morning.”



“It *is* morning,” I snapped.



“You know what I mean.” He sighed and walked towards his room. “Look, you’ll be fine, nothing more’s gonna happen, and we can forget about this. I’ll buy you a beer tomorrow, okay?”



Before I could answer, he’d shut the door.



I tried to get some sleep, but every little sound (Trevor snoring, the wind blowing, the walls creaking) brought my heart that much closer to my chest. Maybe I fell asleep for a while, but I felt like I was awake through it. Never not outside myself. My muscles not quite relaxed at any point.



I got up when I heard Trevor going to the bathroom. It was a bit past 1 PM. My head throbbed.



“Hey,” I said.



“Hey. Slept at all?”



“Nah.”



“Figures.”



He seemed a bit annoyed, like a kid who got caught up between their parents having a fight. 



Before I even knew what I was going to say, the words spilled out. “I think I’ll go for a walk.”



He said “Sure.” I thought Trevor would ask questions, or even tell me not to, but he didn’t. Probably because he didn’t know what I was actually going to do. But I did. 



Or maybe he just didn’t care.



I showered and brushed my teeth quickly, hoping that Case wouldn’t get up before I left. I really didn’t want to see him for at least a few more hours, and going out was a good excuse to do just that. The *only* excuse, besides staying in my room I guess, which would’ve been infinitely worse.



As I put on my shoes, I could hear sounds from Case’s room. I got out before he did. 



The city was bright like freshly sharpened knives, pricking at my hungover, sleep-addled mind with its hustle and bustle. But at least I could breathe, and the strangers around me, living their lives as they always did, gave some respite to the still fear of last night that I seemed to drag behind me with each step, nipping at my heels.



I stopped for a coffee and some breakfast on the way. The coffee was sweet and mildly warm, going down smooth, trying its best to jolt me awake. The sandwich tasted good until I tried swallowing, and each bite was like a firecracker waiting to burst out with a splattering of bile. I finished half of it and breathed slowly.



I found my way back to the antique store. This time, an older man stood at the register. He didn’t look up when I entered.



I wasn’t exactly sure what I was looking for. What even is a cursed object? How would I know when I found one? And even if I did, how do I know it would actually curse someone, and how?



As I picked up things and put them back down, I started to feel really stupid. Maybe Case was right: maybe it was just a fluke. That I’d be fine and the curse wasn’t really a curse and there exists no ancient monster thirsty for my blood. And it started to feel like it, like he just might be correct. A fading nightmare, cracking open in the sunlight, exposing the ridiculousness of it all. Burning to nothing under the dome of reality.



There was an assortment of candle holders on a shelf, big and small, silver and tarnished gold. The way they were placed drew my eye, like dancers on a stage. And the stage: a dark brown rectangle made of splintered wood, painted with a familiar pattern.



I moved the candle holders out of the way, revealing it bit by bit. It was the oldest, most haunted looking ouija board I’d ever seen. I’m not kidding when I say it looked like a prop from a movie, stained and worn and entirely captivating to look at.



It held quite a bit of weight when I picked it up. It wasn’t as thick as a cutting board, but close. And the wood was one whole piece, perhaps maple, not curved in the slightest. It didn’t have a price tag, which was unsurprising. Maybe all the cursed things were missing a price tag. At least that would make finding them a lot easier.



And when I touched it, it just felt… bad. Like rot and decay and the slightest feeling of oncoming doom.



What was obvious was that I wasn’t going to find anything more cursed than this, so I took it to the counter. The man behind it first looked at the ouija board, then lifted his eyes up to meet mine.



“No sale,” he said with a thick accent.



“Huh?”



“No sale,” the man repeated, just a bit louder than before. He took the ouija board and placed it under the counter. “Sorry. Maybe something else for you?”



“Why can’t you sell it?” I asked.



“It is part of store. Not supposed to be for sale, so no sale.”



“I can pay.” I took my wallet out, taking out a chunk of bank notes. “I can pay extra.”



The man waved his hands and shook his head. “Sorry.”



I let out a sigh and put the wallet back in my pocket. “Okay, so do you have something else like that?”



“Wooden board? Yes. Many cutting board, serving plate, other board.”



“No, no. I mean, like *that*,” I said, enunciating with the hope that the man would get what I was saying. Unfortunately, he stared at me with a confused look on his face.



“Like,” I said. “Like my friend bought a statue last night. From here.”



“Statue?”



“Yeah. Like a small, stone statue. It had this long… monster or animal or something.”



“Oh,” the man said, and took the smallest step away from the counter, letting his eyes fall somewhere else. Thinking.



“So. Something like *that*.”



The man shook his head, but still didn’t look at me. Like he was running through something in his head. Finally, he sighed and looked me in the eyes again. “Is it gone?”



“Gone? What do you mean?”



“Is statue gone now?”



“Well… yeah. It got lost soon after we got it. Wait, why do you ask?”



“Lost?” the man said, ignoring my question.



“Yeah, it was misplaced or maybe stolen or something,” I lied.



He looked at me, his eyes squinting ever so slightly. I think my hands were trembling a bit, and I suddenly had an insatiable need to swallow, but I fought not to.



“Who?” he said. “Who did it?”



“Did what?”



“You are taken now. Taken by it. I can see. Who did it? It is important to know who did it.”



“What do you mean–”



The man slammed his palms on the counter. “Who did it?”



“Shit, okay. Okay. It was my friend. The guy who bought it.”



“Okay. Where is your friend from?”



“Uhh, we’re all from London. Tourists.”



The man lifted his palms from the counter, leaned back and rubbed his chin idly. “How he know?”



“Know what?”



“Know how to do it. Make you taken. I know what has happened now. You do not need to lie. Did someone teach him? Help him? Is he who you think he is? Is he really your friend?”



“Geez,” I exhaled. “Yeah he’s my friend. I’ve known him forever. He just looked it up online. You know, the… the ritual, I guess. Whatever you’d call it. Wait, what do you mean *taken*?”



“Okay,” he said. “Okay. I believe you.”



He lifted the ouija board back up and spread his arms. “This not help you. Maybe help, but more likely you get in more trouble.”



“Okay. So what do I do?”



The man shrugged. “Wait. Hope it does not succeed.”



Not the answer I was looking for. “Or I curse him back.”



He looked away for a moment and squinted, slowly letting his gaze fall back on me. “Yes. That should work.”



“So. Can you help me with that? Hence the ouija board and all.”



He sighed. “Normally, no. But I do not know why that statue was out. I don’t know how it was sold. It shouldn’t have been for sale. And not this board either. Shouldn’t be out. Or here, either thing. But I feel responsibility for this situation. So I will help you to break the curse. But after that, I can no longer help.”



“Great,” I said. Only then did some higher level of tiredness escape me, revealing a slightly more critically persuasive part of my brain. It said, *what the fuck have you gotten yourself into?*



But I ignored it. I would reconvene with it once this was dealt with and I got some sleep. 



“You do not need an object. But here’s what you can do…”



The man gave me instructions which seemed suspiciously simple. If I did it right, he said, it would curse the target with bad luck for a year. He said it should be enough, and the effects wouldn’t “ruin his life.” He insinuated that there are curses that could do exactly that.



I thanked him and walked out into the now blistering sun. 



The thought that it was all just a bunch of bullshit never quite went away, but also… fuck it. I might as well perform a little curse, just for safety. Because either curses are real, and this would save me from some malicious evil witch-pet, or they’re not, and none of it mattered. 



I went inside a shitty looking cafe a few blocks off, away from the busy streets. I ordered a steaming coffee, sat down, and drank it quickly. The roof of my mouth went numb. 



I put the cup inside my bag and walked to the handicap toilet. I locked the door behind me, and twisted the handle a couple times to make sure it wasn’t broken or loose.



The man at the antique store said it should be done somewhere quite dark. In the bathroom it was nearly pitch black, but I still needed to see, so I took my phone out, tapped the torch on and placed it on a paper towel on the floor, pointing upwards. The bluish light made the dust look like sprinkles floating in the air. I took the coffee cup from my bag and held it before me with both hands.



I looked into the mirror above the sink, breathed in deep, closed my eyes, and exhaled, counting to ten. Then, I began the ritual. 



First, I opened my eyes slowly and looked into my reflection. I stared into my own eyes, each blink slow and meditative, until the shape of my face began to malform. I pictured a flood of darkness growing just beyond my reflection, like a dam. I don’t know how long I did this for.



Once I no longer recognized myself (and frankly got quite scared of my own reflection), I spit into the coffee cup, still looking at the mirror. With my right index finger, I swirled the thick mucus in a circular motion. Three times right, two times left, four times right.



Then I closed my eyes and dropped the cup on the floor, smashing it into pieces. Then I ducked, still keeping my eyes closed, so I was no longer in the reflection. When I opened my eyes, I was very careful not to look at the mirror. The man hadn’t said why, but that was the one thing he insisted on.



Slowly, I picked up the pieces of porcelain, and carefully put them in the bin. Still crawling, I picked up my phone and bag, made my way to the door, and exited awkwardly into the cafe. A man was waiting outside, confused and annoyed. He said something pointed but I just booked it out of there.



Things felt different as I walked out onto the street. Before, it was like I’d been looking up at a huge tidal wave rolling towards me, blacking out the sun. Readying to swallow me; bludgeon my body into red and yellow pulp.



Now it was like I was inside the wave. Calm and steady. And whatever came upon me, I would crush like it was nothing. 



I wanted to do something, but I wasn’t sure what. Talk to a stranger, drink something weird, get into a fight. But the unfounded confidence became a burden as I found no place for an outlet, so I decided to just head back to the AirBnB and see if it held up. As I walked, I fantasized about how I would act around him: all confident, not scared at all. Not like a little bitch, as he had insinuated.



When I opened the door, I could hear the rapping rain of someone cooking with oil. I made my way in, my shoulders squared and my chin level. It was Trevor, cooking up some eggs. I was a bit disappointed not to see Case around.



“Hey,” he said. “Good walk?”



“Uhh, yeah. Got some breakfast.”



“Cool. Where’d you go?”



At first, I thought he was asking about the antique store. That he’d somehow known. But he couldn’t have, so I acted casual.



“Some cafe, can’t remember its name. Wasn’t that good.”



“They can’t all be winners, right?” Trevor said, giving me an apologetic smile. 



“Guess so.” I returned the smile. “Hey, where’s Case by the way?”



“I think he’s still sleeping.”



“Still?”



“I know, right?”



I shrugged and looked at the eggs. They looked delicious, and I wanted to grab them off the pan with my bare hands. Let the oil scald my mouth and the yolk run down my throat, coating it. The feeling was almost arousing, so I forced my mind someplace else.



“I’ll go wake him up,” I said.



“Uhh, sure,” Trevor said. “You’re not gonna fight again, are you?”



“Nah. We’re good. Just thought we shouldn’t maybe let him sleep the whole day away.”



“Fair.”



Case’s room was quiet from the outside. I knocked and called his name. Then again, and a third time. No answer.



“Must be dead asleep,” Case yelled from the kitchen.



I turned the handle and slowly opened the door. It was dark. The old, worn blinds only let enough light through to paint thin lightsabers around the walls. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust. 



Case was in the bed, tucked under the covers. I couldn’t see his face. I called on him again. Told him to get up, that it was late. 



I stepped inside the room, and the lightsabers flickered out, but the blinds didn’t move. A creak came from behind me, and as I turned I saw the door latch shut. An unnatural darkness, like the sky without the stars, enveloped everything. The confidence I’d had didn’t drop away fully, but it was challenged by something. By fear, distilled into needles, pushing into my arms with pinpricks that made my skin crawl and the hairs stand up.



Something swooshed and thumped behind me. I turned back around, and saw two red spots light up near the roof. Eyes. They glimmered, casting ambient light and faint shadow down below. Staring at me.



Around them, a mangled face. Skin stretched and ripped to accommodate the large, round eyes. Below, a set of sharp teeth, gnawing at the undersized lips, drooling with spit and bright red.



And below, the ragdoll body of Case, still wrapped up in his pajamas. His legs didn’t reach the floor. He was floating. 



The thing opened its mouth and murmured through its ragged mouth, trying to piece something together, but it came out as a wet grumble.



I said something. I don’t remember what, or how loud, but it was loud enough that Trevor ran in. He stopped behind me, and the light of the hallway pushed in like a thousand neon yellowjackets, giving form to Case. To what he’d become. 



“Holy shit. What the fuck. Fuck! *Fuckfuckfuck*,” Trevor screamed, his breath stealing syllables from the words.



The floating thing bellowed a scream that sounded like it was tearing Case’s lungs apart, pushing them to the point of blowing up. 



In the span of less than a second, it turned around and pushed itself headfirst through the blinds and through the window. A crash so loud it could cut, followed by a splat.



The fire alarm went off. Trevor’s eggs were burning, and he said something obscene and ran back to the kitchen.



I stood, staring at the yellow light pouring through the broken window, sliced in odd angles by the crooked and broken blinds. We were on the second story, but it was still quite high up. I thought Case was dead. That something irreversible and horrible had just happened, and I was just waiting for it to resolve. For the next scene to begin, the one where I had to explain to Hungarian cops how our friend died. And why they had big, red eyes. 

From outside, I heard a moan, followed by cracks. Then the [*step, step, step* ](https://wintersnoah.wordpress.com)of feet on asphalt.
