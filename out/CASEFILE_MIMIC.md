# CASEFILE: MIMIC

# #MIMIC-9

Sarah first heard it on a Tuesday night. A soft, rhythmic tapping, barely audible beneath the hum of her refrigerator and the creaks of her old apartment. She dismissed it as pipes settling or the wind rattling the brick exterior. But when it came again the next night—closer, more deliberate—she sat up in bed, listening.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

She pressed her ear to the wall, holding her breath. Nothing. Just silence stretching too long, waiting for her to let her guard down. She pulled away, heart racing, and forced herself to sleep.

By Friday, the tapping had turned into a scratching, slow and deliberate, as if something inside the walls was trying to find its way out. Sarah told herself it had to be rats. That’s what her landlord would say if she called. But deep down, she knew it wasn’t. The sound followed her. From the bedroom to the bathroom. From the living room to the hallway. It was aware of her.

One night, she worked up the courage to knock back. Three sharp raps against the drywall.

For a long moment, there was nothing. Then—

Tap. Tap. Tap.

The exact rhythm of her own knocking.

Sarah’s blood ran cold. She backed away from the wall, her breathing shallow. Something was mimicking her. Something inside her walls.

By Sunday, she couldn’t take it anymore. She grabbed a flashlight and a kitchen knife—because what else could she do?—and pried open the vent in her bedroom. The dark cavity of the air duct gaped back at her. The air inside smelled stale, thick with dust and something else—something rotten.

She shone the light inside.

At first, she saw nothing but darkness. Then, just as she was about to pull away, she saw it. A single eye staring back at her, too wide, too human. And then, impossibly, a grin stretched across the shadows.

The voice that whispered from inside the wall was her own.

**“Let me out.”**

# #ECHO-2

It started with a newspaper article.

“LOCAL MAN PRONOUNCED DEAD—FOUND ALIVE DAYS LATER.”

Ben read the headline twice before clicking on the link. The article was short and unsettling. A man named Daniel Whitaker had been declared dead in a car accident last Friday. His family identified the body. The funeral home received him. Everything followed the usual grim routine.

Then, on Monday morning, Daniel Whitaker walked into his office as if nothing had happened.

Ben frowned, scrolling through the article. Coworkers said he looked the same, talked the same—except for one detail. He didn’t seem to remember the crash. Or the hospital. Or dying.

When his wife confronted him, he only blinked in confusion.

“I was never in an accident,” he had said. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

His fingerprints matched. His dental records matched. Every test confirmed he was Daniel Whitaker. And yet, his body—his original body—was still in the morgue.

Ben’s stomach twisted. He shut his laptop.

The article didn’t have an explanation. Just a final, eerie line:

*"The man known as Daniel Whitaker continues to live his life, seemingly unaware that he already died."*

Ben sat in silence for a long time. Then, slowly, he pulled out his phone and searched for something else.

Another name. Another obituary.

His own.

Dated five years ago.



# #RECURSION-16

Dr. Ellen Hayes first noticed the copy when she was brushing her teeth.

She leaned over the sink, spit, and wiped her mouth. When she looked back up, her reflection hadn’t moved.

It was still brushing.

A slow, deliberate stroke. The toothbrush dragged against its teeth, foam spilling over its lips.

Ellen froze.

The reflection caught up in an instant, snapping into place like nothing had happened.

She told herself she was imagining things. Stress. Lack of sleep. It had to be.

Until it happened again.

At work, in the elevator, her reflection hesitated just a second too long. In her office window, it turned its head *before* she did.

By the third day, it had started smiling.

Ellen wasn’t smiling.

She stopped looking at mirrors. At windows. At polished surfaces. But that didn’t stop it from looking at her.

One night, she knocked over a glass of water, and in the reflection of the spill, she saw it.

Standing behind her.

Not in the mirror. Behind her.

She turned—heart hammering, stomach twisting—

Nothing.

But the next morning, when she stumbled, half-asleep, into the bathroom, she found her reflection already waiting.

Standing still.

Smiling.

And when she turned to run, it stepped out of the glass.

# #FRACTURE-01

It started with a crack in the mirror.

Small at first—just a hairline fracture running through the glass in Ben’s bathroom. He didn’t remember breaking it. But as the days passed, the crack spread.

By the end of the week, it wasn’t just the mirror.

The glass on his phone screen split down the middle. The window in his bedroom developed a jagged line that hadn’t been there before. The windshield of his car—cracked, webbed with fractures like something had struck it from the inside.

Then it wasn’t just glass.

Ben’s coffee mug splintered in his hand. The tiles in his kitchen broke under his feet, fissures creeping across the floor in patterns too deliberate to be random.

His bones started to ache.

One night, he woke to a sharp, splintering sound. Not from the mirror. Not from the windows.

From inside his chest.

Ben clutched his ribs, his breath coming in ragged gasps. Something was breaking inside him—he could feel it, hairline fractures racing through his bones like cracks in ice. His fingers trembled as he pressed against his skin.

Something shifted beneath it.

A deep, silent pressure, like something inside him was trying to get out.

He staggered to the mirror, sweat dripping down his face. His reflection was cracked beyond recognition—dozens of fractured lines splitting his features into pieces.

And then—

The cracks moved. The reflection smiled.

Ben didn’t.

He felt it then—a final, deep snap in his chest. A shattering from the inside out. His body collapsed inward, breaking into a thousand jagged shards—bone, flesh, and something else.

Something that had been waiting beneath his skin.

The thing that looked like Ben stepped out of the mirror.

The real Ben was just pieces on the floor.



# #RECURSION-00

The first sign was small. A misplaced cup. A chair slightly out of place. Things Sara couldn’t remember moving but convinced herself she had.

Then, it got worse.

One night, she found her phone on the kitchen counter. She never left it there. When she picked it up, it was still warm—like someone had just been holding it.

She lived alone.

By the end of the week, she noticed herself out of the corner of her eye.

Not in mirrors. Not in reflections. But in places she wasn’t.

A glimpse of movement at the end of the hallway when she was in the living room. A shadow sitting on her bed when she was in the shower. A figure standing in the doorway when she turned off the lights.

The worst part? It wasn’t just watching.

It was *practicing.*

It touched her clothes. Sat in her favorite chair. Used her voice when no one else was around.

The night before she disappeared, a neighbor heard something through the walls—Sara’s voice, laughing softly. But when they glanced through the window, they saw her standing perfectly still in the dark, staring at nothing.

The next morning, Sara was gone.

The police searched her apartment. Everything was exactly as it should be. Except for one thing.

The mirror in her bedroom had been shattered from the inside.

And whoever cleaned up the glass—it wasn’t her.

# #FALSE AUTHOR-19

Incident Location: \[REDACTED\] 

Secure Archives Facility

Date: Ongoing

Status: *Compromised*

The Secure Archives Facility was established to document, analyze, and contain information regarding anomalies deemed high-risk for memetic spread, replication, or contamination. Access is restricted to Level 5 personnel only.

However, a breach was discovered when a classified file was found in the system that no authorized personnel had written.

Discovery of FALSE AUTHOR-19:

* The document appeared suddenly within the archive, properly formatted and categorized.
* No logs indicated who created it.
* The file referenced cases that had not yet been recorded.
* The writing matched the style of the Archivist, the individual responsible for compiling the most sensitive case files.

The Archivist denied writing it. Swore they didn’t.

Then—more files appeared.

Each one described a new case, always with precise detail. Locations. Dates. Descriptions.

And then those cases began happening.

Incidents described in the files manifested in the real world *after* documentation. Events that should have been impossible to predict. It was as if the act of writing them down was bringing them into existence.

At first, the Archivist thought they were prophetic—some kind of unknown precognitive ability emerging.

Then they found the file with their own name on it.

It described them sitting at their desk, reading a file they didn’t remember writing, their fingers hovering over the keys, unsure if they should continue.

Exactly what they were doing at that moment.

The last line of the file was unfinished. It simply read:

*"The Archivist realizes now that they are not the one writing this."*

The Archivist has ceased all documentation.

But the files keep appearing.

The above selection of files are reports filed by agents of the Anomalous Detection Agency, the ADA, an independent organization that chronicles paranormal, supernatural, and other reality-bending entities and events. I was once a part of the ADA, working under the code name AUTHOR-2, successor to a longstanding member of the organization: ARCHIVIST. My job was to classify and identify patterns in paranormal events to create profiles for particularly hostile or dangerous entities. 

The files above represent all that we know about the behavior and attitude of the entity codenamed Mimic. Mimic’s actual manifestations are, by its very nature, somewhat variable. However, they share certain characteristics which I believe make them one and the same entity, although my predecessor didn’t share my view. I’ve removed agent information and locations from most of the files. Although my time with the ADA has ended, I still have obligations of confidentiality. I’m posting these files here because I’ve come to believe people need to know what’s out there. They need to know about the Cycles.
