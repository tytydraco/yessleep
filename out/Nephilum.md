“What- wh am I…..
I was born, I had a mother, a father
But I never died
What does that make me
A monster, a person 
No, I never died, I can-can’t be a person 
But did I do anything wrong, what is a monster 
Do I need to kill to be one or does simply existing be my sin”
I awoke to a crash, my eyes beating in a harsh flashing light, w— where am I—-. I look around blood stains my coat and forehead. No, no no no, fuck not her. I crawl over the broken glass, taking off my seatbelt with a strength I didn’t have. I gently caress her face. Not my Charlie, god, no no no, fuck, my daughter, the one thing that loved me.

The days flash and turn. The arguments, the crying. I can’t stand to look her in the eyes. She calls me a coward, a fucked up bastard that let our daughter die. I take it, having nothing to say, it was my fault after all, why should I have any right to say.
I stare at the glass of whiskey, it empties and fills like the ryrhmn of a heartbeat, 1,2,3,4 fuck. I get dragged out of the bar screaming and crying for no one, anyone to bring her back, to please just let me have her, or take me too. Praying for her, praying for the first time in my life.I walk out drunk as a sailor and don’t even notice the car-

I wake up, next to my wife, her body cold from the room around her, I tap her shoulder, she’s dead asleep, I roll to my side before going to the one room I want to, Charlie is asleep, so quite and peaceful , her birth was a miracle the doctors said, she should have died but my little angel lived. I breathe a sigh of relief and wander to her side.
“ how am I still alive, I died, I saw it
How many times 
What am I becoming “
I wake up, palms shooting with pain, I rub them, soothing them before looking over to the cradle. I made a promise, if it was me or her, I’d let her live, I’d save her. I walk out of the room. I go into the bathroom and swallow my medication, and read the label, but I can’t read it, I’m so busy trying to reading it I don’t even feel the pill get wedged in my throat, I gag and cough and wheeze. But no one comes, no one did.
“No no no not again 
I can’t”
I wake up next to a car, the driver walks out and checks me out, minimal damage to the car, the guy is young and pale, clearly shaken by something , he apologizes profusely, I just laugh and walk away, I don’t know why I do, but I just keep walking . Tears flow freely now, what a joke, apologizing, pfft. I walk to a bench and sit. The air is cool, even in my state of inebriation I can see and feel it. I lean back taking a long draw on my cig.A man sits next to me handing me a cig, I look at the cig then him.
“Mind giving me a light”

I laugh and hand him the lighter, focused on the sky around me.
“Nice night”
I simply nod

“Now what brings you out here”

I hiccup before responding 
“Got nowhere else I guess “

The stranger smiles , I barely notice
“Yeah, I get that, what can I do for ya”

I look at him for the first time, he’s a tidy man, clean shaven with a suit a pure white that radiates light off the barely lit backdrop. His suit is accented with gold bands and ribbons, yet he gives off a simple look, not overly flashy but enough to give a presence.
More pressing is his eyes. A piercing blue that radiates charisma.

“What do you mean”

He breathes in before checking his watch and turning his head back to me.
“What is it that you want most”

I give a hearty chuckle 
“My daughter “

He gives a warm smile, feeling genuine
“ and then?”

I stare at him intently, sobering up for a second 
“Then, I don’t fucking know, then I’ll do whatever it takes, I’d give everything, even, even me”

He is not even taken aback as he sits and pats my shoulder letting me cry.
“ tell me how many people have you walked by, openly in trouble, dying, poor beggars “

“I I don’t know, too many”
I look down in shame

“And did they deserve my help, my love, my passion “

I look at him confused 
“Yes I suppose “

He smiles 
“Then you have your answer “

A ripping pain shoots in my chest as I fall to the floor. Grabbing my chest I feel palpitations as I fall.

I wake up sitting at the table, wife a soft smile playing across her face

“Well well how did you sleep sleepy head, I saw you this morning with little Charlie”

I look over to Charlie sitting in her booster seat a happy smile on her lips as she eats her dried apple chips

“ I slept well, just nervous with the baby I guess”

She laughs
“She’s more of a toddler now babe, isn’t that right all grown up”
She teases Charlie as Charlie laughs.

Something isn’t right here. She was a bab-

My wife’s grin turns gleeful, a maniacal laugh darting from her lips 
She rips and tears layer and layer, skin muscle then she stops, eyes a crimson red
“Tell me what is it that you desire “
The thing muses
I back away
“Come onnnnn now, don’t bE shy TEll ME”

“L leave”
I whimper

“wHyyyy, yUo LOve me rightttt, like you lovedddd our daughterrrr”
It smiles fiendishly before taking a knife and gutting her palm, marking the floor in a sigil as she mops her blood into something Runic.

In an instant she’s gone and a charming dapper man is in her place. Sitting calmly as he points to the chair. I didn’t even realize I stood up. I darted my face to the chair Charlie sat in, she’s-she’s gone.
“Yes your daughter is gone, Charlie was it”

“What the fuck you do to my daughter”
I slam my palms on the table

He hisses a laugh, demeanor never changing
“Now that’s no way to talk to a visitor, I thought your father taught you better, or did he not beat you hard enough “
He chuckles
“What the- fuck, how you know my father, where is my daughter!”

He smiles as he replies 
“ I know because I have spent so much time getting to know you, how tragic that he blamed you, blamed you for being born, for the crash that took her. Mmmm so unfortunate, unfair. You were just a boy, weren’t you”

“Shut up!”

His eyes glow a burning red that seeps of fire
“Now I am not so kind as my father, I will tell you this as a courtesy, you may not belong to me, but you are far from safe”

“W-what are you “

He gleens a smile
“ well aren’t we full of questions, but to get that let’s play a game, you win and I will answer one thing honest, if you lose I will lie, now the kicker, you won’t know if you win or loose”

“And if i don’t play”

“I didn’t ask, now you may sit down or I can force you if you won’t behave”

I sit

“Good fella, now let’s play, rules are simple, I will pick a card, you pick a card, I will ask you a question, if your wrong no matter what, I lie, if you answer right, you get a chance at the truth, pick a card and if you guess right, you get the truth, wrong and I lie. Now if you fail more than three questions by the end of the game, then I will guess your card, then if I’m right, you are mine, fair”

I nod,shocked

“Alright first question, who was at fault for the car crash that took your mom”

I go pale
“Answer who I feel is at fault”

He smiles, unreadable 
“ well of course. What else”

“Or who they said”

He is blank and unreadable 
“I can’t say, I gave you my question “

“Was it Tyler Joen , the other driver “

He hands me the cards, offering them, I pull the ace of spades. He smiles then leans back

“Now ask your question “

“What are you”

“I’m a being as old as time, something that is fear”

“Okay, what does that mean”

“You asked your question “
He smiles with a clear glint of annoyance 
“Now who is the current president “

“Biden right”

He smiles before offering a card
I take the ace of hearts and he smiles, one of these is the wrong card but better to get one right and one wrong to figure it out

“Ask”

“Where is my daughter”

“With her mother”
He smiles slyly

“But that tells me nothing “

“You asked, I answered “
“Now what country were you born in”

What it can’t be this easy
“Germany, my mother was stationed there”
“What is your name”
He hands the cards and I pick tha ace of spades

“I have many, il uni Caduti, rigini di dimonio,Samuel “

“Samuel, like the angel?”

“Once yes”
He smiles wickedly 
 
“And now…?”

“That’s another questionnnn”
He teases
“Now who am I really?”

“Is, is that my question?”

“Of course, you may not use any of the names I gave you but rather my most common nomination “
“For this I suppose a hint is fair, I am often considered a deadly sin, and confused for the sin of wraith satan and sin of gluttony beelzebub”
“I am neither “

“Earlier you said my father? What did you mean?”

“Mmmm yes my father, you met him, I can’t tell you who that was tho or it will take all the fun”

“Are you the devil…. Lucifer “

“Pick a card child “
He offers them 
I pick spade
“Ask”

“Where am I “

“You are home”
He smiles deviously 
“Now you have won, enjoy your fun”

“Wait no!”
But he’s gone, leaving the bloody scene on the ground 
I sat there for days processing, nothing happening but me sitting, frozen. I then noticed the cards, he left them, I looked them over before noticing something I was sure was not there before. A message, two words long “ Charlie’s Room”
I ran to the room finding it… empty. I wanted to give her the life I didn’t , the life free of so much pain. I wanted her to feel loved, to not feel bad for existing like my father made me feel. I dug around desperate for anything, something, finding a door that wasn’t there before. I dug and slammed into it before it creaked open, the room was old and dirty, filled with cobwebs and dead insects, in the center was a photo. This picture, dated December 15, 2023 “like mother like son” was a car crash, one that I faintly remember , one that I don't think I ever woke up from.
