For years, the students at our high school called Mr. Fuller ‘Bucket Man.’ We did so because everywhere he went, he carried a five-gallon paint bucket.

No one knew why he hoisted it around or what was in there. We just knew his favorite form of punishment was to bring students into his office and force their hands into the gallon drum. 

Today, it was my turn. All because I had been thirty minutes late to gym class.

“Do you know why you’re in here?” Mr. Fuller asked. 

“Yes.” 

He slid the bucket in front of me and tapped the lid.

“Mr. Fuller, I understand what I did. I’ll never be late again.”

“Open it, Bobby, or I swear you’ll never leave this room.”

The muscles in my body tensed. Mr. Fuller was six foot three, built like a semi, and had all the credentials of a well-respected member of society. I didn’t have much physical or relational capital to resist his demands.

*Come on,* I thought, *what’s the worst it could be? Just take the lid off and stick your hand in.*

I secured my fingers around the lid, then pulled.  

*Damn. It’s on tight.* 

“Is that the best you can do?”

Mr. Fuller shoved me aside, gripped the lid with both hands and — 

POP!

— ripped it off like it was nothing.  

By now my fingertips were creased from the pulling. My clothes were drenched in sweat. 

“Put your hand in.” 

I shuffled to the bucket’s edge, my feet as heavy as cement blocks. 

When I peered inside, my eyes went wide with horror.  

The thing before me resembled a mass of pulsing yellow flesh. Its single, bloodshot eye rolled around its body like a billiard ball. Slimy tentacles smacked against the sides of the tub, trying to get out.  

“What is it, Mr. Fuller?”

“Your punishment.”

He grabbed my wrist and shoved it into the goopy flesh. I tried to resist but his strong grip held me in place. 

“It hurts…”

A burning sensation started in my fingers, then moved up my arm.

“It’s pulling me in…”

Mr. Fuller yanked me free, shoved me in my seat, and snapped the lid back onto the bucket.

By now the skin on my arm was hot pink, like a first-degree burn. It hurt so bad I could barely breathe. 

“Have you learned your lesson, Bobby?”

“Yes.”

“Someday this creature will return to you and continue your training.”

*My training?!*

Mr. Fuller pointed to the door and said without emotion: 

“You can go now.”

***

I never found out what was in Mr. Fuller’s bucket. He died several weeks after our encounter in a car accident. And his creature? It was gone too. 

Years passed and I relocated across the country for university. I was eager to start my new life. 

But then, several weeks into my first semester, I saw something… 

As I stepped out into the student quad area after my last class, I spotted an odd shape squirming in the grass. 

It was the yellow blob. Its single eye was focused on me. Its maw of needle-like teeth widened hungrily. 

I remembered Mr. Fuller’s words: *Someday, this creature will return to you and continue your training.*

Before I could do or say anything, it slid into a nearby storm drain and was gone.
