It was a complete accident. I had no intention of actually joining a sick and twisted Discord group full of incels. I wish I could take back what I saw… Or what I did because of what I saw. Or what I’m about to do after I finish typing this final farewell because of what I saw and what I did…

&#x200B;

  
…Late one night, 2 weeks ago, I just finished my shift early. I work graveyard shifts at a local grocery store, restocking and organizing shelves. That night, since we had less merchandise to stock and more workers than usual, we finished 4 hours early. My supervisor asked me if I wanted to go home or stay behind doing little tasks to get my full 8 hours.

&#x200B;

  
I asked to stay. If I were to leave early, there was nothing to do in my shitty one-bedroom apartment. Plus, my co-workers—though they're older than me by decades—are cool to hang out with. I had no social life outside of work.

&#x200B;

  
My supervisor said okay, at first, but then saw that there were too many people staying and decided to send me home. He said since I’m the youngest—20 years young—that I should leave. I didn’t know what logic he was going off of, but I left for the sake of not arguing.

&#x200B;

  
I hopped in my beat-up Toyota Camry, with different colored door panels resembling a quilt, then drove home. The roads were cold and empty roads—empty besides littered trash floating and gliding in the breeze. Homeless people slept on ice-covered sidewalks with grocery carts full of their belongings. This whole town was an eyesore. 

&#x200B;

  
I sped up, desperate to get home and drink myself to death. Wind whistled through the crevices of my cracked windshield like a boiling teapot. The sound combined with the rattling engine and the eyesore surrounding me made my blood boil. *How did I end up like this?* I thought, *Just another grain of sand surrounding an ocean—a toxic, radioactive ocean with mutated sea life.*

&#x200B;

  
To calm the impulses that popped up in my mind, I reached into the glove compartment for a packet of cigarettes and lit one.

&#x200B;

  
I finished 2 cigarettes by the time I pulled into my apartment complex. I parked under a flickering street lamp and shut off the engine. It started to drizzle at that moment. It was as if the sky was waiting for me to park, with a clear view of my apartment, only to send down rain and remind me how pathetic I was.

&#x200B;

  
I sat in the driver's seat, staring out with empty eyes. Empty eyes that twitched. I suppressed the anger by lighting another cigarette. Part of me hoped I got lung cancer, so I died a slow death.

&#x200B;

  
After sitting there for a while, breathing like an empty shell of a man, I got out and entered my apartment. The claustrophobic feeling I’ve gotten so used to hit me like a truck as I stood at the entrance and glanced around. There were only 4 walls with a bed somehow cramped by the back wall—how they managed to fit it there, who knows? Besides the bed was a plastic bucket with a roll of toilet paper next to it. And besides the bucket were some dumbbells, varying in weight. Finally, next to the dumbbells, there was a mini fridge. That was it.

&#x200B;

  
I shut the door behind me with a disappointed sigh and went straight for the fridge. I grabbed a Hennesy bottle and sat down in my rough bed. As soon as I did, all the tormenting thoughts came back to haunt me: *You’re worthless.* I shook my head at that thought. *Get a new job.* I nodded. *You’re just drifting in the breeze like that littered trash you saw on your way here. Why not just end it?* I replied to that thought, “No, I’m not. This is… just temporary.”

&#x200B;

  
I drank and drank, but the thoughts were still there. I reached under my bed and pulled out the dust-covered laptop my mother bought me, hoping I would use it for college or to meet new people. Just then, I got a thought…

&#x200B;

  
*Omegle.*

&#x200B;

  
I booted up my laptop and connected to the hotspot on my phone, since I didn’t have Wi-Fi. I opened up Omegle and typed in a common interest: ‘Making New Friends’ 

&#x200B;

  
Looking at myself through the webcam, my eyes were bloodshot. My curly hair was ruffled up and my facial hair was overgrown. I looked like a caveman. So, I quickly shaved my beard into stubble and gelled up my hair to make myself presentable. 

&#x200B;

  
A woman around my age popped up on my laptop. She was smoking a vape and scrolling through tik tok with the side of her face facing me.

&#x200B;

  
“H-Hello!” My voice cracked.

&#x200B;

  
She looked at me and burst out laughing before pressing skip. *Okay…*

&#x200B;

  
The next few people were the classic disgusting masturbators or some trolls attempting to roast me. I was just about to call it a night when a stoner popped up. He had a bowl-cut with a neatly trimmed beard.

&#x200B;

  
“Hey,” he said.

&#x200B;

  
“What’s up man,” I said.

&#x200B;

  
“Not much. I just got off work and now I’m smoking my ass off.”

&#x200B;

  
I chuckled. “What do you do?”

&#x200B;

  
“I work graveyard shifts at a warehouse.”

&#x200B;

  
“Yooo, same. I work at a grocery store though. I just got off work myself.” I took a sip from the Hennesy bottle, my stomach and heart feeling warm. “We got out early.”

&#x200B;

  
“That’s crazy, we did as well. There were more than enough people tonight. Where are you from?”

&#x200B;

  
“From Cali.”

&#x200B;

  
His blue eyes widened. “Same…”

&#x200B;

  
“I live in a shitty part of Cali, though. The roads are full of scum,” I said.

&#x200B;

  
He laughed. “Oh man, tell me about it. Same where I live.” He sat there for a second, stroking his beard. “You seem like a cool dude. I have a discord group with another person from Cali who hates scum just like us. You wanna join?”

&#x200B;

  
“Yeah sure, man. What’s discord? Is it like Zoom?”

&#x200B;

  
He looked at me and chuckled. “You don’t know about discord?”

&#x200B;

  
“I’m not much of a social media guy.”

&#x200B;

  
“Oh you’ll fit right in with us,” he said. “Make a discord. It’s fairly easy, just type in your gmail and make a password. When you do, press this server link.” He sent a discord link through the chat. I quickly copied it. “Nice meeting you…?” He asked.

&#x200B;

  
“Zayn,” I said.

&#x200B;

  
“Nice meeting you, Zayn. I go by Remly. I’ll be waiting for you in discord.”

&#x200B;

  
“Cool, man, thanks for this!”

&#x200B;

  
“No problem,” he said. “Fuck the scum.”

&#x200B;

  
“...Y-Yeah,” I said indecisively. The tone in which he said that sounded like a mantra of sorts. It was as if he’s said it millions of times before and lived by it. He gave me a wave and pressed skip, leaving me to stare at static.

&#x200B;

  
*Weird, but cool dude,* I thought, *Ehh, who am I to judge? I'm weird myself.*

&#x200B;

  
I made a discord account, naming myself **‘DonQuixoteZo’**. Then, I copy and pasted the link into a new tab and pressed search. The page took a while to load, but when it did, an invitation popped up: **You’re invited to join The Necrotic Brotherhood. 2 members. 2 active right now.** The profile picture was an eagle flying in front of an American flag. Millions of thoughts and scenarios crossed my mind in a fraction of a second.

&#x200B;

  
*What the hell is this? Brotherhood? …Is this some sort of racist group? If so, why would they invite me? I’m a Mexican. Well, a light skin Mexican, but still.*

&#x200B;

  
I went against my gut instinct, prioritizing the urge and desire to socialize.

&#x200B;

  
**Invitation accepted. Loading…**

&#x200B;

  
**Loading…**

&#x200B;

  
**Loading…** 

&#x200B;

  
**DonQuixoteZo joined the server. Say hello!**

&#x200B;

  
I pressed the little sticker of a dog-looking creature who was waving. It sent in the ‘general’ chat. On the sidebar, there were only two text channels and one voice channel. The text channels were titled: **General**, and, **Meet-ups.** The voice channel was titled: **Discussing Business.** There were two people in the voice channel.

&#x200B;

  
**RemlyTheFriendly:** *Hey, welcome! Feel free to look around and get a feel of the server. Join the voice channel once you do. I want you to meet someone.*

&#x200B;

  
**DonQuixoteZo:** *Thanks, will do!*

&#x200B;

  
I scrolled through the general chat. Most conversations were normal, just like any conversation me and my coworkers would have: TV shows and Movies they’ve seen and recommended. Encounters they had with annoying people at work or in public. Their family and home life. Hot woman they saw.

&#x200B;

  
*Okay, okay. Maybe I was overreacting, I thought. The name and profile pic are both still a bit odd, though.*

&#x200B;

  
I joined the call. The ding of my joining cut off their conversation.

&#x200B;

  
“H-Hey,” I said.

&#x200B;

  
“This is Zayn, the one I met on Omegle,” said Remly.

&#x200B;

  
ExoticKitten69 spoke up in a deep, raspy voice, “Greetings, Zayn. I’m Exotic. Nice to meet you.”

&#x200B;

  
“Nice to meet you too, Exotic,” I said. *Shit, I absolutely suck at small talk.*

&#x200B;

  
Exotic continued, “I’ve heard you despise Californian scum as well?”

&#x200B;

  
“Uh, y-yeah. There is so much trash littered in the streets. Don’t even get me started on the homeless people.”

&#x200B;

  
“*Trash*,” Exotic echoed. “What trash do you refer to?”

&#x200B;

  
“Well, the trash bags, all the littered garbage, the smell, etc.”

&#x200B;

  
Exotic chuckled. “I see Remly taught you the terms we use when referring to scum. What is your least favorite?”

&#x200B;

  
*Terms? What the hell was he on about?*  “...Uhh, I-I guess the trash bags? They smell ridiculously bad and there’s a lot of them ”

&#x200B;

  
“Very good,” Exotic said. There was a child-like happiness to his tone. “That’s our least favorite as well!”

&#x200B;

  
*Wha-What?*

&#x200B;

  
Remly unmuted himself. “Yeah, we dispose of them once a week—”

&#x200B;

  
“Silence,” Exotic demanded. “Can you not see we’re having a conversation? What did I tell you about interrupting?”

&#x200B;

  
“I’m sorry, your grace,” said Remly.

&#x200B;

  
*Your grace? What the fuck did I get myself into? No, no, this is not normal at all.* 

&#x200B;

  
“Sorry you are.” He cleared his throat. “Anywho, back to our convo, Zayn. Remly took a liking to you, but how can *I* know you mean business?”

&#x200B;

  
The casual tone in his voice shook me to my core. At this point in the conversation, I had three likely meanings behind this group: 1. They are a racist group, like I thought before. 2. They are referring to homeless people as scum. 3. They mean actual littered trash, which is highly unlikely given their demeanor.

&#x200B;

  
*I’m so fucking stupid. I knew something was up yet I still went ahead and joined. All because I wanted to socialize. Stupid, stupid. I have to find a way to get out of this group.*

&#x200B;

  
“...Zayn? Still there, buddy? I really hope you’re not thinking of turning back. Because it’s too late for that now.” His tone got less friendly.

&#x200B;

  
“Y-Yeah. I just went to grab some more liquor.” I stuttered and took a long sip of the same Hennessy bottle I had.

&#x200B;

  
“I see,” he said. “What kind of liquor?”

&#x200B;

  
“Hennessy.”

&#x200B;

  
“Hennesy, huh? Yummers,” he said in a sarcastic tone. “I’m more of a clear, white Tequila guy myself.”

&#x200B;

  
“Cool, Tequila isn’t so bad.”

&#x200B;

  
There was an awkward silence. Exotic spoke up, “I just got a brilliant idea. This can prove you mean business.”

&#x200B;

  
*Do I play along with them? Do I leave? What would they do if I left? They don’t know my address, only what state I live in.*

&#x200B;

  
“Do me a favor, Zayn. Go ahead and join my stream.”

&#x200B;

  
A rectangle popped up which said ExoticKitten69 was streaming. Hesitantly, I joined it. A mouse was moving around a desktop with the same eagle flying in front of an American flag as the wallpaper.

&#x200B;

  
“Can you see my screen?” Exotic asked.

&#x200B;

  
“Y-Yes,” I stammered.

&#x200B;

  
“Very good. Now, what I want you to do is turn on your webcam. I want to see your live reaction to our last disposal.”

&#x200B;

  
*Leave, now!* My brain told me. *Get the fuck out!*

&#x200B;

  
“Just so you know, we have your IP address. Don’t try anything stupid, okay?”

&#x200B;

  
*How? When did they… That’s right, fuck! The link I pressed.*

&#x200B;

  
“Okay,” I said, turning on my webcam. My eyes were droopy from the absurd amount of liquor I consumed. Whatever he was gonna show me, I’d have to react normally. They couldn’t suspect a thing. That was the only way I could think of at the time to get out of this situation.

&#x200B;

  
His mouse hovered over a desktop folder titled: **Disposals.** He pressed it and 5 video files popped up. He clicked the first one and opened it up.

&#x200B;

  
**Loading…**

&#x200B;

  
**Loading…**

&#x200B;

  
The video played. I saw a man walking with the camera being pointed down at the sidewalk with two pairs of legs in the frame. Inaudible chatter could be heard from behind the camera. One deep, raspy voice sounded familiar. Exotic.

&#x200B;

  
He whipped the camera up, showing an empty dumpster with moldy stains on the exterior.

&#x200B;

  
“Pay attention, this is the good part,” said Exotic, commentating over the video.

&#x200B;

  
The camera man stepped back, giving me a wider view. They were in an alley. A hooded figure walked in front of the frame. Though there was a shadow cast over his face, I could make out a neatly trimmed blonde beard, Remly. Remly was holding a black garbage bag.

&#x200B;

  
The man behind the camera did a countdown. “3… 2… 1… Go!”

&#x200B;

  
Remly hurdled the bag over his head and into the dumpster. The two laughed like idiots in the video.

&#x200B;

  
Exotic giggled like a girl as the video ended. “You should’ve seen the look on your face!” He said cheerfully.

&#x200B;

  
I stopped grimacing. I was expecting to see some horrid sight. Instead, I got two jackasses pulling a prank on me. I shook my head and smiled at the camera.

&#x200B;

  
“Funny, huh?” Exotic asked.

&#x200B;

  
“You got me, I’m not gonna lie,” I said with a chuckle.

&#x200B;

  
“Here, check out video 2. It’s even funnier.” His deep voice had an excited tone. It was as if he was waiting to unravel some Christmas presents.

&#x200B;

  
He pressed the ‘next’ button and video 2 popped up. I leaned back in my bed with a smile.

&#x200B;

  
**Loading…**

&#x200B;

  
**Loading…**

&#x200B;

  
**Loading…**

&#x200B;

  
The video played. The camera was still, like it was mounted on a tripod or leaned against a sturdy object. Darkness engulfed the frame. Blue moonlight shone down, barely outlining a silhouette posed in front of a brick wall. They were in an alley of sorts. The same as the previous video.

&#x200B;

  
“Action,” a deep voice said.

&#x200B;

  
The click of a flashlight echoed. Light from behind the camera illuminated the figure. The camera had to take a second to adjust to the sudden light contrast. When it did, Remly was visible. He wore the same black hoodie with black gloves and pants. He was crouched down, holding something just out of frame of the camera.

&#x200B;

  
The camera whipped down. I gasped.

&#x200B;

  
A homeless man was squirming around with Remly’s hand around his neck. The man had an overgrown and tangled up beard. He wore old, torn clothes. There was a thick rope tied around his mouth. His yellow teeth were clamped down on it, lips moving desperately as if trying to talk—trying to plead for his life.

&#x200B;

  
“Watch,” commentated Exotic, “this is my favorite part!”

&#x200B;

  
With his free hand, Remly reached behind and pulled out a big hunting knife. He swung it down. It dug into the man’s eye. Blood squirted out, staining Remly’s clothes. There was a fleshy squelch as the knife was slowly being pulled out. The man kicked and let out a muffled scream. A deep, raspy voice giggled from behind the camera.

&#x200B;

  
I wanted to look away. Wanted to leave this call and group forever. Wanted to go back to my normal miserable life. But something in me didn’t want to look away. I wanted to bear witness to this and have a reason to go after these sick men. To avenge everyone they’ve done this to.

&#x200B;

  
I felt my face cringing. So, I made the expression vanish and put on a serious face. They wanted that reaction out of me. I’ll give it to them—along with justice for what they did.

&#x200B;

  
Remly carved out both of the poor man’s eyes and raised it up like a trophy. The video abruptly ended.

&#x200B;

   
“Huh,” said Exotic, impressed, “get a load of that.”

&#x200B;

  
I stared, unblinking, into the webcam.

&#x200B;

  
“You passed our test,” he said. “Welcome aboard!”

&#x200B;

  
Remly unmuted himself and cheered with Exotic.

&#x200B;

  
I sat there in silence, smiling at the webcam as all their death scenarios played through my mind. *Exotic will die slowly. Remly, I’m gonna hang him.*

&#x200B;

“When can I join one of these disposals?” I asked.

&#x200B;

  
Their laughter dwindled away. Exotic spoke up in a serious tone, “Next week.”
