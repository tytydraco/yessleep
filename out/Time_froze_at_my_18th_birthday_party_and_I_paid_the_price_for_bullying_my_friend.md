This subreddit might not be the right place for my story, but I just experienced a fundamental fracture in reality. And now I really want some comforting comments. Tell me I hallucinated the entire thing. I wouldn’t believe you, but you could try.

I invited some friends to my parents’ house, and we were chilling in the garden. Sitting on rickety deck chairs. Blasting Alt-J through a tinny Alexa speaker. Nursing canned cider that Dad bought for us. I often try to be aware that I’m a socially-inept, acne-ridden teen. But knowing yourself to be something doesn’t make it any less true. My impulses often get the best of me.

And that was what happened during a game of Dare/Spin the Bottle last weekend.

“It’s you, Lila!” I cackled. “And the dare is that… you’ve got to kiss John.”

Lila turned bright red. “I didn’t really wanna play this game, Mike.”

“Boo!” John cried, pursing his lips. “Give me a smooch.”

“Don’t be arseholes, guys,” Katie groaned. “She doesn’t want to kiss John, and I don’t blame her.”

“It’s the rule!” I said, laughing callously. “Or would you rather go home, Lila?”

I’m deeply ashamed of that emotional manipulation. Lila is a reserved, introverted person with deeply-rooted anxiety, and I used that to my advantage. There was no way she could refuse. She wouldn’t want to be kicked out of the group.

For a fleeting moment, tears filled her eyes, and I felt a piercing pang of guilt. She leaned in to kiss John, and then a terrifying thing happened.

Time halted.

Or, rather, my friends halted. The tree leaves and grass strands continued to flutter in the ever-quickening gusts of howling wind.

“Er… Guys?” I whispered, frightfully clambering to my feet and waving my hands in front of their frozen faces.

Then I heard a distorted chuckle, which sounded eerily like my own, and my neck hairs stood to attention. Other than the whistling wind, the laugh was the only sound in that haunting realm.

I spun around to face the back of my garden, and I saw a shape behind the fence. Something was peering through the gaps between the panels. I saw an eye — almost human, but far too wide and stretched horribly out of shape.

“It’s you, Mike,” A petrifying voice taunted, parroting my own words.

I screamed as the figure squeezed itself through the fence panels, slithering its misshapen, half-human body into my garden. And there, standing at the edge of the lawn, pointing a gnarled finger at me, was a jumbled version of Lila. Limbs disfigured, one eye larger than the other, and crooked, colourless lips.

I turned to view the real Lila, who was still stuck in time, and then I returned my gaze to the smiling monstrosity that was slinking towards me.

“And the dare is that… you must remove a finger, Mike,” The horror wheezed in an inhuman voice. “It’s the rule.”

Existential dread consumed me. I was certain that it must be a psychotic break, born from guilt of what I’d done to my friend. I still would believe that, were it not for what happened next.

Lila’s spectre seized me by the neck and hoisted me from the ground. I shrieked, gazing into the eyes of the girl’s embodied trauma. A malevolent demon of my own creation.

“Please…” I begged, choking.

“It’s the rule!” Lila bellowed.

With unnaturally long, sharp fingernails, the creature tore at the flesh on my chest. I walked in excruciating pain at the deep gashes, which released pools of blood into my shirt.

“Or would you rather go… home?” Lila asked, looking down and cackling.

The lawn caved inwards, revealing an endless void beneath the surface of the Earth. Lila hurled me to the grass and smiled, laughing as I crawled away from the ever-expanding hole in the ground.

Wailing, and terrified beyond measure, I took a look at my left pinky finger and wondered how I could remove it to free myself of that frozen nightmare. The searing pain from the claw marks on my chest made it difficult to think coherently.

In a moment of insanity, driven by a primal urge to survive, I placed my pinky finger in my mouth. I thought of something I’d heard about the strength of the human jaw. We can tear through flesh and bone with our teeth. It’s possible. But it’s a question of mentality, rather than physicality.

I bit.

I could attempt to describe the pain, but words would be insufficient. I nearly blacked out, and all I remember is Lila’s ghoul grinning at me with those haunting eyes as my pinky tore free from my hand.

And then my friends were screaming.

“Mike?” John yelled, jumping to his feet. “How did you get over there in the space of a second?”

They ran over to my bloodied, mangled body several yards away.

“What the fuck happened to him?” Katie screeched. “Call an ambulance!”

That’s how I know I didn’t imagine it. And Lila looked just as perplexed as the rest of my friends. I truly believe she had nothing to do with what happened. I think reality broke for a moment. Her pain caused it.

I caused it.

Whatever the case, I learned something on my 18th birthday:

Actions have consequences, even when others don’t see them.

Lila hid her pain, but that didn’t make it any less real. I saw the terror within her mind.

I apologised to my friend, and I pray I’ve fixed the glitch in reality. I pray her fractured self never haunts me again.
