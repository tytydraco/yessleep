[I didn’t think my first night in my new home would be like this…](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z7wwqi/many_sons_had_father_abraham_1/)

&#x200B;

I didn’t sleep a wink after the whole incident with Minnie and Patrick. The fact that he’d been the one to answer after I’d called 911 disturbed me. Had he rigged the phone in the house somehow? Or was his phone the only phone 911 calls in this place went? I tried to tell myself that everything was going to be okay. I mean, Patrick probably had just taken Minnie back to her husband Bill and that was the end of it… It should’ve been the end of it, right?

&#x200B;

Oh God, I wanted that to just be the end of it…

&#x200B;

Come morning, Joel was up early along with the rest of the family to get ready for Church. I lay in bed as he got up to get dressed and from where I pretended to sleep, I watched him open my side of the closet and look through my dresses before picking one out and laying it on the bed for me.

&#x200B;

I’d never seen Joel pick out an outfit for me to wear before… I didn’t know if I should read into this or not. It’s not like there was anything wrong with the dress he’d picked it’s just… He’d never done that before.

&#x200B;

Once he’d put on a suit jacket and button down shirt, I watched him step out of the bedroom, calling for Patrick. I could hear Briar in Shannon’s room helping her get dressed, and I listened, trying to make out any bits of clear conversation. I heard nothing. I would’ve thought Minnie’s singing last night would’ve woken up more people than just Patrick, but…

&#x200B;

I didn’t know what to think…

&#x200B;

*‘You’re being irrational.’* I told myself. *‘You don’t want to live in this stupid fucking farmhouse in the middle of Alabama, so you’re looking for reasons to be uncomfortable.’*

&#x200B;

Was I?

&#x200B;

My eyes were heavy and my body cried out for sleep as I sat up in bed and slowly started to get ready. I showered and put on the dress that Joel had picked out for me, and hoped that maybe with enough coffee, I could at least get through the morning before finding an excuse to take a nap. The upstairs was quiet as I prepared to go down. Briar had already helped Shannon downstairs. I could hear them in the kitchen. I was about to go down and join them when I heard a voice from one of the nearby bedrooms.

&#x200B;

“Morning, sunshine.”

I paused, feeling a fresh chill run through me at the sound of Patrick's voice. Slowly I looked over at him. He was wearing a green button down shirt, with the same vest over it that he’d worn to my wedding. He was adjusting his cufflinks as he leaned against the doorframe of his bedroom. Behind him, I could see an unusually clean room.

&#x200B;

“Patrick…” I said quietly.

“I just wanted to apologize for last nights mess. I might’ve come off as a little cranky. You did right by Minnie and Bill, bringing her in like you did. He says ‘Thanks’ by the way.”

“I just wanted to make sure she was okay.” I replied.

“Oh trust me. She is. We look after our own out here. I’m glad you’re willing to be part of that.”

“Yeah, of course.” I said, before deciding that this was probably the best time to ask questions.

“When I called 911 last night… I didn’t mean…”

&#x200B;

“It’s fine.” He said, cutting me off, “I imagine I didn’t come across as the best person to leave the poor girl with… And she tends not to like me much when she’s having one of her little episodes. Not entirely sure why. You were worried. I can respect that.”

“Yeah.” I said, “Why did it go to your phone when I called, though?”

Patrick cracked a knowing smile.

&#x200B;

“Well more or less I’m the law in Smokey Falls. I’ve got emergency numbers for some state troopers and the nearest hospital if we need ‘em. But most of the time, folks are only calling because they saw some animal or another out on their property, and they want somebody to go and shoot it. We figured it’s easier if the number goes right to me, instead of bothering the police in the next county over who’re gonna take an hour to get here anyways.”

“I see…” I said quietly.

He reached out and put a hand on my shoulder, probably as a reassuring gesture.

&#x200B;

“Anywho. Just wanted to clear the air after last night. We didn’t exactly leave things in the best way. So. You and me. We’re alright?”

“We’re alright.” I said and Patrick gave a nod, before pushing past me.

“Good. Then let’s get us some breakfast.”

&#x200B;

I watched as he lumbered down the stairs without a care in the world and as I did, I couldn’t help but think that half of what he’d just told me was complete and utter bullshit.

St. John The Baptist, Fontanist Church sat along the bank of a river on the far side of town. It was a large, boxy building made of stone that looked more like a community center than a church. There wasn’t a lot else nearby. The church was fairly isolated. The only thing around us was more or less just endless forest, stretching on seemingly forever.

&#x200B;

Judging from the architecture, I got the feeling that it had been built sometime in the 1960s or 70s and that it hadn’t seen a lot of updates since. The pattern of the carpet in the lobby was dated and the walls were covered in antique wood paneling. Walking in almost felt like taking a step back in time.

&#x200B;

I remained close to Joel’s side as we went in, with Shannon being escorted by Patrick behind us. Briar on the other hand seemed to keep her distance, going in before any of us.

&#x200B;

Joel, Patrick, and Shannon mingled with some of the well dressed strangers, most of whom seemed overjoyed to see Joel again, and who fawned over me like a new baby. They all introduced themselves, but I don’t recall most of their names. It was just a parade of strangers I’d likely never see again.

&#x200B;

After socializing for a bit, we went to the chapel to get a seat. The chapel almost reminded me of a high school gymnasium. The floor was faux wood, there was a raised platform at the end with a truly massive cross hanging from the wall above it, and an altar where I saw an old man with a bushy white beard and shiny bald head making his preparations. Something told me that this was Father Abraham. From where I sat, I could see that he had intense blue eyes and a slightly red face. He actually reminded me a little bit of Santa Claus, for some reason. It was probably the beard.

&#x200B;

He was dressed in all black with his clerical collar almost completely invisible underneath his beard. I watched him prepare for the sermon, lighting the incense before donning a pastors robes. He approached a podium up by the altar and placed his hands on it, before finally leaning in to speak.

&#x200B;

“All rise.” His voice was deep and seemed to fill the room.

At his request, all rose and Father Abraham began his sermon.

“Heavenly Father, we give thanks only to you. And we thank you once more, for permitting us all to come together in your Holy name. Blessed be our Lord, amen.”

“Amen.” Came the reply.

&#x200B;

Father Abraham surveyed the crowd before him thoughtfully, before speaking again.

“What a… Sorry state, we find our world in today, Brothers and Sisters. You all see it. I know you do. Each day, our nation… Our world, creeps further and further away from the vision held for it by the Lord. Each day, the talons of evil sink deeper and deeper into the hearts and minds of mankind and turn redemption from a promise… Into an impossibility. Jesus Christ promised salvation to those who believed in him and Satan… Satan seeks to make a liar out of him. Snatching good souls from salvation. Corrupting them. Twisting them to his evil purposes… And because he does it so well. He believes that he is winning. ***Is he, Brothers and Sisters?”***

&#x200B;

***“NO!”*** Came the reply which was so loud that it echoed off the walls.

&#x200B;

“That’s right…” Father Abraham continued, pacing like a lion up on the altar, “*He is not.* He can not win. Because he does not comprehend the power that he stands against! An unstoppable force, far greater than we can comprehend! The time will come… The time will come when Jesus Christ, the King of Kings squashes his evil empire like a bug! It will come soon! Sooner than the sinner thinks! Sooner than we think! It is at hand. We know not His plan, Sisters and Brothers. But we know it comes so long as we are loyal… Are you loyal, Sisters and Brothers?”

***“Yes!”*** Came the cry.

Father Abraham smiled.

&#x200B;

“Yes… You say…” He repeated, before staring into the crowd, “Anthony Walker… Did you say Yes, just now?”

I saw one man in the middle row squirm uncomfortably.

“I did…” He said quietly.

“Are you loyal?” He asked.

“I am, Father Abraham!” He said.

“You’re so sure of that? Because I myself… I’m not so sure…”

&#x200B;

Abraham descended from the altar, walking between the pews, his eyes never once leaving Anthony Walker.

“I cannot help but notice… The tithe from your household was light, last week.” He said, “I have said before… And I will say once more. The tithe is important. It is necessary. A show of faith. Faith is not shown in silence it is shown by deeds. Actions. To tithe is to support your community. It is to support this one true house of God… The Bible says; ‘*God loves a cheerful giver*.’ Are you not a cheerful giver?”

“I… I apologize, Father… I gave what I could!” The man stammered.

&#x200B;

“God does not take excuses, Anthony…” Abraham said softly, “And neither do I… You do not give what you can. You give what you are obligated to give. You render unto God, what is rightfully his. What was always his! If you only plant what you can, then you don’t reap much, do you? But if you plant what you *must*… Then your harvest shall be bountiful… Amen!”

“Amen!” Came the cries from the congregation.

&#x200B;

Father Abraham turned and stode back up to the altar to continue his sermon.

“Pray for America, my children… Only God can save us from the evil that knocks upon our doors. But God will only save us if we demonstrate our unyielding faith in him and in Jesus Christ! *Salvation is not for all! Salvation is not unconditional!* And those who are not saved… *Will burn*.”

&#x200B;

As the sermon continued, I sat and listened uneasily. I’d been willing to give this whole thing a chance… But seeing the way Abraham had torn into that poor man set me off. I couldn’t help it! He’d given the man so much shit just for not paying a big enough tithe, and I could see that poor man still pale and shaking slightly as if he’d been convinced Abraham was about to tear his head off! That didn’t seem particularly righteous to me. If there was a God, I can’t imagine that was how he wanted to be worshipped.

&#x200B;

The rest of Father Abraham's sermon wasn’t much better either. He went on, diving deep into the topics of sin and Hellfire… But everyone seemed to hang on to his every word. At one point, I even looked over at Joel and saw him staring at Father Abraham, truly transfixed, as though he was buying into this stuff!

&#x200B;

Near the end of the sermon, a collection bowl was passed around, and I watched everyone depositing checks into it. Not cash. Checks, as if they wanted the exact scale of their contributions to be seen. I only caught a glimpse of the contents as the tithe bowl passed me by, but I could see some of them were for about two hundred dollars! Two hundred dollars tithe? What the hell? That seemed crazy to me! Who in their right mind was paying two hundred dollars per sermon to this guy? I tried not to let myself dwell on it, but it was admittedly kinda hard not to…

&#x200B;

After the sermon came a short lunch.

&#x200B;

The congregation shuffled into another room next to the chapel with a somewhat bare bones kitchen, a puke green carpet, and faded beige walls. Most of the furniture looked quite old as well.

&#x200B;

The lunch spread looked about on par with what you’d find at a cheap hotel's continental breakfast, with fruit, bagels, juice, and little ham and cheese quiches in a warmer, along with roast potatoes. The whole thing tasted like I was going to have horrible diarrhea that evening. Patrick helped Shannon over to one of the tables, and I went to fix her a plate before getting one for myself.

&#x200B;

As people shuffled around the buffet, I watched Father Abraham himself come in to mingle. A few of his more enthusiastic followers shook his hand, thanking him for his sermon and he seemed to just drink up their praises with a smile. I wasn’t that surprised when he made for our table.

&#x200B;

“Well, well. Shannon Anderson. So glad to see you can still make it.” He said warmly.

“Only thanks to your grace, Father Abraham.” She replied, grinning stupidly up at him.

“Not my grace, child… Thank the Grace of God.” He patted her on the shoulder, before looking over to Joel who seemed like he’d been waiting patiently for Father Abraham to notice him.

&#x200B;

“As I live and breathe, little Joel! You’re looking very good! Oh, and this must be the wife. Danielle, right? I’ve heard a lot about you.”

He fixed me with a warm, fatherly smile as he put a hand on my shoulder.

“It’s just Dani, actually.” I said.

“Dani? Like a boys name. I like Danielle more… If that’s all the same to you.” He said, but didn’t give me a chance to tell him that it really, really wasn’t.

&#x200B;

“Well. So glad you’re a part of our flock now. I’d always known Joel here would bring home a good woman. Our boy didn’t disappoint.”

He still had his hand on my shoulder. I shifted slightly to get away, but he kept it there.

“So, how’d you like your first sermon?” He asked.

“Um… It was great.” I said, “I think… I think you’ve got a little more spirit than the priest at our parish back home.”

&#x200B;

He laughed.

“Darling, I’ve got more spirit than ten city Priests… I’ll admit, a lot of what I say is intimidating. But I know well that a little fear of the Lord can push good people into greatness.”

“God talks to Father Abraham directly.” Shannon interjected, “He knows his voice well.”

“God talks to us all directly.” Father Abraham said, “You just need to know how to listen, and you will hear His voice, when you need to.”

&#x200B;

“Oh, I’m still listening.” Shannon said, “And I hear the whispers… But I haven’t heard the voice quite yet.”

“You will, sister. You will.” Abraham assured her before his attention turned to Patrick.

“So good to see you today, my boy. So good. I heard you had a little trouble with Minnie again last night.”

“Nothing I couldn’t handle.” Patrick assured him, “Dani actually was the one who found her out in the woods.”

&#x200B;

Abraham's eyes shifted back to me.

“And you took her in?” He asked.

“I was just trying to help…” I said quietly.

“Well you certainly did. Minnie’s a very sick girl and I’m afraid she hasn’t quite been herself since our last prayer session the other month.” Father Abraham said, “Some people don’t react to these things quite so well. It’s a mental thing, I suspect. Something in the mind… Ah, but I’m rambling now. Left alone out there, she could’ve been hurt in all manner of nasty ways. Bill owes you his thanks!”

&#x200B;

His eyes lit up suddenly as if he’d just remembered something.

“Ah, and speaking of prayer sessions… Joel, will you be joining Patrick and I tonight? We were doing a prayer circle for some members of the community, your mother included, although we’ve also invited the Walters boy, at the request of his father.”

“I wouldn’t miss it for the world!” Joel said.

“That’s the Joel I remember! We’ll be seeing you tonight then! Six o’clock!” Father Abraham said and gave me a parting look.

“I’ll be seeing you soon, won’t I, Danielle?”

“Um… Yeah…” I said, forcing a smile, “Of course.”

&#x200B;

With that, Father Abraham excused himself and went to mingle with some of the other members of his congregation. As soon as he was gone, I gave Joel a wary look. He was still grinning from ear to ear.

&#x200B;

“So… That’s Father Abraham?” I asked.

“Yup. He’s great, right?”

“Yeah…” I mumbled halfheartedly, “So, you’re going to a prayer circle tonight?”

“Yeah, Father Abraham hosts them for community members in need. It’s just sort of a little social gathering. You really don’t have to come. It’s sorta a boys club anyways.” He said with a sheepish smile, “It’ll be nice to reconnect with the guys in town though!”

&#x200B;

“Well, I’m glad… I hope you enjoy it.” I said quietly, before deciding I might as well ask the question on my mind.

“So, did Father Abraham say that Minnie was at one of those prayer circles? Did something happen to her there?”

Joel shrugged.

&#x200B;

“Hun, you do know that I kinda just got back into town, right?” He asked, “Although Minnie was always a little… Off. You know how some people are. They get sorta weird with these kinds of things. Father Abraham means well, but the prayer circles don’t always help. I mean… Look at Mom…”

“Makes sense.” I said quietly, “Well, you have fun then.”

“Course I will.” He promised me, before giving me a kiss on the head.

&#x200B;

After Church, we headed home. Joel and Patrick dropped Shannon, Briar and I off before heading out to do some work down at Smokey Oak. I helped Briar get Shannon back inside, and then spent the better part of the afternoon finishing our unpacking.

&#x200B;

“So… What’s your thoughts on Father Abraham?” Briar asked me as I set things up around the bedroom. She leaned in my doorway, watching as I worked.

“He’s… Nice.” I said, “I can see why everyone likes him.”

She just laughed.

“No you don’t.” She said, her tone plain and blunt, “You know you’re not a very good liar, Dani.”

&#x200B;

I paused for a moment before forcing a smile. No point in keeping up the facade.

“Alright, maybe he’s not my cup of tea.” I admitted, “A little too ‘Hellfire and Brimstone’ for me. “And the way he talked to that one guy, the guy who didn’t give him enough money… I don’t know…”

&#x200B;

Briars face remained stoic. She didn’t return my smile.

“Just do yourself a favor and don’t say anything about it around Mom or Patrick. Mom’s convinced that Father Abraham is going to cure her and Patrick…” She trailed off as if she wasn’t sure exactly how to finish that sentence.

“They really buy into this stuff.” I said. She hesitated for a moment before nodding.

“Yeah. Patrick’s been leading Father Abraham’s little prayer circles for the past few years.” I noted a hint of disgust in her voice.

&#x200B;

“You don’t sound like you approve,” I noted. She paused, before softening her tone a little.

“He’s trying to do some good for the community… Helping people like Minnie and Mom. Moreso people like Minnie…”

“What exactly is wrong with her anyways?” I asked, “Do you know?”

“I do. But it’s not polite to gossip like that.”She said, “Bill wouldn’t like me getting into his daughters' private affairs.”

&#x200B;

I raised an eyebrow. Hadn’t Patrick said that Minnie was Bill’s wife the other night? I was about to ask about it when Briar started talking again.

“Anyways, I suppose what I’m trying to say is… My advice is to keep quiet about this sort of thing. Let the boys do their thing. Leave Mom to her… Beliefs and keep your head down. It’ll make life here a whole heck of a lot easier.”

“Well, I appreciate the advice.” I said, and as Briar turned to leave, I hit her with one last question.

“These prayer circles, what do they do there anyways? Joel said it’s some sort of boys club?”

&#x200B;

Briar paused, tensing up a little before looking back at me.

“See, that’s the kinda question you’d probably be better off not asking.” She said, “Best to leave that kind of thing well enough alone.”

I forced a laugh, but it didn’t sound very sincere.

“You’re making it sound a little ominous, Briar.”

&#x200B;

She just kept staring at me. She seemed like she was about to say more before I heard Shannon calling her from downstairs and without another word to me, Briar was gone. For a moment, I stood alone in the bedroom. Absolutely nothing that Briar had said had set me at ease… If anything I almost got the impression that she was going out of her way to creep me out. Maybe she was? Maybe this was all some sort of weird prank she was pulling? While that didn’t really sound like Briar, I also couldn’t say that I knew her that well considering we’d only met a handful of times before Joel and I had moved in…

&#x200B;

My higher brain told me that there probably was nothing to worry about. I mean, what could possibly be so bad about a community prayer circle?  What could possibly be so bad about a community prayer circle that Minnie had come out of. Minnie… Who’d mindlessly been wandering through the woods, singing ‘Amazing Grace’ last night.

&#x200B;

There went my imagination again. Jumping to wild conclusions. Obviously, nothing weird was going on at this stupid prayer circle. Joel was there for Christs sakes! I could hardly imagine Joel partaking in anything that messed up, and for all his preaching of hellfire and brimstone, I doubted Father Abraham was up to anything sinister either. Frankly, the man struck me as little more than just another money hungry pastor milking his congregation simply because he could. He wasn’t anything more than your garden variety religious huckster, the kind of Priest that gives religion such a bad name in the first place. Even if this prayer circle was nothing more than an excuse for some of the guys in town to get together, there probably wasn’t any bad that could’ve come out of it!

&#x200B;

But… Would it really hurt for me to stop by? I could bring something over as an excuse. Maybe some stuffed mushrooms or something, a nice little appetizer to say: “Thank you so much for welcoming me into your community.”

&#x200B;

That seemed harmless enough. Joel would probably see right through it, but if he asked me I could just say that I was curious. It wouldn’t exactly be a lie. Yes… The more I thought on it, the more it seemed like a good idea. I’d bring over some snacks as an excuse to visit the Church and see just what they were up to over there… Then, once my curiosity was finally sated, maybe I’d take a nap and put all this behind me.

&#x200B;

That sounded nice.

&#x200B;

I offered to make dinner for Shannon and Briar that night as a ‘thank you’ for inviting me into their home. I didn’t just make the offer as a convenient excuse to use the kitchen either, I genuinely did want to express my gratitude. Much as I thought Shannon was unhinged and Briar was a little ominous, they had still been pretty good to me so far.

&#x200B;

I popped down to the grocery store for some ingredients and settled on a favorite comfort food of mine. A sort of one pan chicken, broccoli and rice with cheese. It’s simple and filling. I roasted some potatoes on the side and did the stuffed mushrooms as well, putting a few extra aside that I could take to the Church later.

&#x200B;

Dinner was a fairly uneventful affair. Shannon spent most of it rambling on about a pastor she’d watched on TV and I admittedly didn’t pay much attention. Briar sort of kept her distance from both of us, eating quietly and helping Shannon back to the living room before retiring upstairs. I was as close to well enough alone as I could get, so I took the mushrooms I’d made, told Shannon I was heading out to run some quick errands, and drove back to the Church.

&#x200B;

Dusk had settled in as I drove down the dusty roads to the Church. I couldn’t get any radio stations other than gospel music, so I’d sort of just accepted the one that was currently playing, since I couldn’t be bothered to go looking for the aux cord. I had the sneaking suspicion that the songs they were playing were more for kids than adults. The song that was playing was something that straddled the line between catchy and annoying. A man with a very irritating voice was singing it with what sounded like a brass band in the background. I can only remember the lyrics:

&#x200B;

*‘Father Abraham, has many sons,*

*Many sons has Father Abraham.*

*I am one of them, and so are you,*

*So let's all praise the Lord.’*

&#x200B;

If I didn’t vaguely recall hearing the song before, I probably would’ve paid more attention to it. Instead, I just got a little laugh over the fact that this just so happened to play while I was going over to visit a Father Abraham. Life is funny like that sometimes, I guess.

&#x200B;

I turned down the road towards the Church and against my will, found myself tapping my fingers against the steering wheel to the beat. All in all, I was feeling a lot better about this little visit of mine. I expected someone to meet me at the door, take the mushrooms and then send me on my way. Maybe I’d see Joel and get some quiet reassurance that he wasn’t involved in anything strange, then have a good laugh on the way back about how I let my anxiety get the better of me.

&#x200B;

Ha ha! Very funny! That’s when I saw the light.

&#x200B;

It came on so suddenly, a flash through the trees just ahead of me. It was blinding enough that I hit the brakes and forced the car to a stop. The afterimage seemed seared into my retinas for a moment.

&#x200B;

What the hell was that?

&#x200B;

I blinked slowly. The light was still there and it was still blinding… And I could’ve sworn that it was coming from the Church. For a moment, I was worried that the building might’ve been on fire or something but no… No, as far as I could see… (Not that I could see much.) It almost looked fine…

&#x200B;

I shielded my eyes from the blinding glow. It was like someone had shone a floodlight into my eyes, and slowly began to creep the car closer.

&#x200B;

It’s hard to describe just what I was thinking in that moment… Moments like that tend to go by in a blur and your thoughts can get lost in your stream of consciousness… I suppose the only justification I can offer for why I kept driving forward is because I wanted to see what the hell was going on over there!

&#x200B;

The car kept forward at a snails pace. I ended up putting the sun visor down just so I could keep the light out of my field of view and just focus on the road. As I got closer, the radio seemed to cut out. The song seemed garbled and chopped up as some other sound drowned it out.

&#x200B;

Not static… I don’t know how to describe it, other than trumpets, or someone hitting every single key on an organ at once. But it just seemed to get louder and louder until I finally turned off the radio entirely.

&#x200B;

My head throbbed with a pain that hadn’t been there before… Was it the light? I swear it was hurting my eyes?

What was it?

&#x200B;

What was going on?

What about Joel? Oh God, was he alright?

&#x200B;

As the car inched closer, I felt myself starting to get a little woozy. My foot slipped off the gas pedal as I tasted copper in my mouth. The car still inched forward, but I wasn’t moving it. It just sort of drifted closer to the Church. With a shaking hand, I shifted the car into park and felt it lurch violently. I flopped against the steering wheel.

&#x200B;

I felt sick like I was about to vomit. I fumbled with the car door before pushing it open and tried to get out, but hadn’t thought to undo my seat belt. Instead, I just lay helplessly against the seat and vomited there. It ran down my chin and my shirt, but I didn’t have the brain capacity to even care in that moment. I was drifting away.

&#x200B;

Even though the radio was off, I could still hear that droning, organ noise… I felt dizzy and sleepy. My vision started to fade as I began to slip into unconsciousness. I could hear the snarl of an engine beside me followed by the feeling of hands on me.

&#x200B;

I felt someone undoing my seat belt and pulling me out of the car. And in between the moments of blackness, I felt myself being dropped into the back seat of another car. Finally, my mind faded away entirely. I was gone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wake up.”

&#x200B;

I felt someone lightly slapping my cheek and shifted a little. My eyes fluttered partially open. My head was still throbbing and I still tasted blood in my mouth. Everything around me seemed a little too dark still, and it took a few moments for my eyes to adjust. I was in the back seat of a car still, only now I was sitting up. I was also still covered in my own vomit. Lovely.

&#x200B;

“I told you to leave well enough alone.”

I recognized the voice as Briar’s and tried to focus on her. I weakly said her name but she didn’t respond.

“What… What the hell just happened…”

“You did exactly what I told you not to do. That’s what the hell just happened. And if I’d left you there, you’d probably be brainlessly wandering around the goddamn woods just like Minnie.”

&#x200B;

I blinked slowly and tried to focus on Briar. I saw her leaning against my car, the tray of stuffed mushrooms I was bringing to the Church in one hand. She’d eaten most of them.

“What was that…” I murmured, “The light…”

She didn’t answer me.

&#x200B;

“Bet you thought they’d find it cute, right? Joel’s little wife, stopping on by with some snacks, checking in on the boys. Maybe they might’ve acted that way… But Patrick would’ve been furious. Dunno if he’d have said anything to you or not. He’s still putting on a face for you since you’re still brand new. But I know my brother. He would’ve been furious.”

She popped another stuffed mushroom into her mouth.

&#x200B;

“Where are we?” I murmured.

“Down at the end of Church Road.” She said, “I moved you away from the light soon as I found you, then I went back for your car when I had a moment. Not sure if I’m impressed or pissed off that you got as close as you did. Course… I also wasn’t entirely sure you’d wake up without your brains fried… I’m still not sure.”

&#x200B;

She popped the last mushroom into her mouth and set the plate back in my car. I was starting to come back to full consciousness again and tried to take a step out of Briar’s car. My legs buckled like jelly underneath me and she caught me, stopping me from falling.

“Sit.” She said, “You’re gonna need a sec for your strength to come back.”

“What happened?” I asked again, “What was… What was that light?”

Briar still didn’t give me an answer.

&#x200B;

“Y’know, Patrick was worried about this… Joel marrying some city girl. But Joel swore up and down it wouldn’t be a problem. Guess he was wrong.”

“What are you talking about?”

“I like you Dani. I really do. So I’m gonna give you one last tidbit of advice… Go home, change your shirt. Pack your bags and be gone before Joel gets home. Don’t look back. This town ain’t for you. It ain’t for me. It ain’t for anyone sane.”

“Can you just answer my goddamned questions, please?”

&#x200B;

Briar paused, and for the first time I saw her crack a smile. It looked more sad than anything else.

“Sorry honey… But the less I say, the better. I know you want me to sit you down and talk through it all with you. But you don’t want these answers…”

&#x200B;

She took me by the hands and gently led me back to my car. She helped me into the drivers seat before handing me a clean shirt.

“Best you change before coming home and throw the dirty one in the wash before anyone sees it… Oh, and Dani?”

&#x200B;

I looked over at her as she opened the drivers seat of her own car.

“You don’t breathe a word about tonight to my brothers or to Mom. You don’t even say a word about it to me. We clear on that?”

“I… Yes…” I said softly.

Briar gave a curt nod, before getting in her car. A moment later, she was gone again, leaving me alone on the darkened road.

&#x200B;

As she instructed, I changed my shirt before driving back home. I kept a white knuckled grip on the steering wheel as I drove and could feel my hands shaking a little. I kept thinking about that blinding light at the Church… And I kept thinking about Briar.

&#x200B;

Whatever this was, whatever the hell was going on here, she didn’t seem to want to discuss it with me… And I suspected that it wasn’t because this was just a prank. I suspected it was because whatever this was, she was terrified of it. And that left me terrified too.

&#x200B;

When Joel got home that night, it was already past midnight. I hadn’t slept a wink. I’d just laid in bed silently waiting for him. I still pretended he’d woken me up when he turned on the lamp on his bedside table to get changed for bed.

&#x200B;

“Hey…” I said, “How was the meeting?”

“Just great!” He said, putting on a big smile, “Reconnected with a buncha the guys, it was nice. You have a good night?”

“Yeah… Great…” I said.

&#x200B;

That smile on his face… That warm, loving smile.

&#x200B;

It used to make me feel safe.

&#x200B;

Now I couldn’t help but notice that it didn’t quite seem to reach his eyes.
