I was mowing the grass when it happened.

It was approaching July and Grandpa's property was small but in constant need of a cut. The rains had been numerous in the last few months, the lightning cutting the sky with long forks that shook the mountains most nights, and Grandpa's grass would be ankle-deep by next Friday if this kept up. I didn't really mind mowing the half acre that held Grandpa's house, but the acre in the down below that he also owned was full of stones and roots that would make the endeavor treacherous. 

I was cutting around the back of the house when I suddenly heard the sound of a flute.

I picked my head up, the setting sun making me squint as I looked into the woods. The flute was high, something about it sounding almost magical, and I felt my feet taking me towards the dark mouth of the woods. I was like those children in the story about the mice, and with each step, I felt less in control of myself. I began to sway a little, the charms and wards that had been slow to come to my mind now falling hollowly away in the face of such a draw.

I had just passed into the shadowy embrace of the forest canopy when someone tackled me around the waist and pushed me to the ground.

I struggled against the person, my feet jouncing to the tune of the flute, but as the music began to move away, I looked up to find that Glimmer sat atop me.

"Hell of a greeting, Glimmer, as usual."

I expected to see her childish smile full of mischief, but her face was dower. 

"You are lucky I came to your rescue, Hunter. What were you thinking? Following the fairy pipes into the woods, you could have been killed!"

"Good thing you were here to save me from the woodwind section," I said, a little flippantly though I meant it in jest.

"What's all the ruckus?" Came a voice from the house and Grandpa came stumping onto the porch. He looked concerned but it was tinged with good humor at the sight of us rolling in the grass clippings. Clearly, he thought he had come across something a little more intimate, but one look at Glimmer cleared that up.
"Hunter was about to follow the Faye Music into the woods." Glimmer stated matter-of-factly, getting off me so she could help me up.

"Jesus, boy. Didn't I teach you better than that?" 

"What in the hell is the Faye Music?" I asked, now completely confused as I swiped grass clippings off myself.

Grandpa started to look cross, but then scratched his chin as he thought about it, "Have...have I never told you about Faye Music?"

"Fairy LIGHTS, yes. Faye Music, no." I said.

Glimmer turned her angry look towards Grandpa now, "Fisher! How could you not warn him? You know how devious they are."

"Excuse me," Grandpa huffed, throwing his hands up, "There's a lot of things in the woods that could kill any one of us and not all of them are magical or unknown."

A few minutes later as the sun settled into the dying light of the day and our drinks sat sweating in their cupholders, we sat on the porch as Grandpa told me about what had nearly ended my life.  

"Faye Music isn't actually of the Faye," Grandpa amended, "but that's what Glimmer has always called it."

"It is what Father always called them, and just because it is not connected to the fairy courts doesn't mean it isn't of Faye." Glimmer said a little haughtily. 

"Are you ever going to elaborate on these Fairy Courts that you keep talking about?" I asked, more curious about them than weird forest music.

"Focus, haus." Grandpa said, "We ain't talking about fairies tonight. The Faye Music is disembodied music that guides people into the woods so that whatever is causing it can take them away and do whatever it intends to do with them."

"Wait, so does it kill them or just take them?"

"No one knows," Glimmer said, "Those who are taken never return. Whether they are devoured by whatever plays the music or it simply takes them to Faye for sport, no one ever returns."

I took a long sip as I thought that over, not sure what to say about that.

"It isn't even native to the Appalachian area. I first encountered it in Alaska and other people have reported hearing it in the desert, while at sea, and one in the tundra of Siberia. Whatever it is, it's greedy, and it's hungry."

Glimmer looked up from the condensation on the side of her bottle, loving to watch the moisture trails as they slid down it, "Wait, you never told me that you heard the Fairy Pipes in this Al Aska place."

"Yup, one night while I was drinking with John, actually."

He started to take a sip but stopped as he noticed us eyeing him intently.  

"What?" he asked.

"Nothing," Glimmer said, "This is just usually when you tell us another of your stories about times gone by."

"Yeah," I added, "We assumed you were setting up a Grandpa Story."

Grandpa drained his beer in a single long pull before tossing the bottle over his shoulder where it bounced off a tree and fell without breaking.

"I mean if you insist. It all started much like this, with lukewarm beer and good friends telling tales on Johns Porch."

John and I were sitting on the porch with two of his younger cousins. Both were in Highschool and were visiting for the summer, and the four of us were sharing stories. The oldest of the two, Maus, was telling us about how he had been fishing in his kayak when something had bumped him and made him lose his paddle. After a few hours of aimlessly floating, he had been pushed back to shore by something and hadn't taken to the water again since.

"It could have been a whale or an orca I suppose, but Da always figured it was the Kushtaka. They had probably taken my oar to begin with and then felt bad about it after the fact when they realized I would drift out into the ocean." 

We sat in silence for a few minutes, sipping our beers contemplatively, but only one great mystery had my mind, and that was whether I could make it to the edge of the woods before my bladder burst. I had become gripped by a sudden and monstrous need to make water, and now that the story was told, it had reared its head like a breaching whale to remind me that it was here and must be served. I excused myself, leaving my bottle on the porch rail and high-stepping it to the wood as my drinking mates laughed behind me.

I hit the edge of the trees, unzipped, and let fly as my groaning innards sighed happily. The night beyond the porch was lit by little besides the moon and as I watched the trees sway in the light wind I couldn't help but shudder a little. After the Fairy Lights, I didn't much like to be in the woods at night, and these woods were as far from my woods as they got. Everything from the stony soil to the strange trees made me feel like an explorer in a foreign land.

I had just finished, my zipper half up, when I heard the first halting refrains of the last thing I would have expected.

It was a piano and it was playing something deep and haunting.

 I looked back towards the collection of houses, expecting to hear it coming from someone's open window, but when I looked back, I realized it was coming from the woods. It was music played by a master, someone who had perfected their craft over years and decades and millennia. I took a curious step forward, wanting to see if it was a real piano or just someone with a radio, but that step became another as my curious feet brought me into the dark woods. The moon was muted here, the ground a mystery that my feet seemed to understand better than I did. I went a little deeper, the music calling me to explore and before I knew it the warm glow of civilization was nothing but a suggestion behind me.

That was when I realized something more than piano music might be going on.

Whatever curiosity had taken me was beginning to ebb as the memories of my last moonlight stroll reasserted themselves. Had my chase of the Fairy Lights really been so different? My drunken friends and I had gone tripping through the woods as we chased our death, and only I had come back again. Whatever this was, I feared it meant to do the same thing, and though I pulled against it, I was powerless to stop my feet from pulling me ceaselessly forward. I tried to reach out for nearby trees, but it appeared my arms were outside my control as well. I was a fly in the spider's web, a bug in the mouth of a fly trap, and I was walking straight into danger. 
The song played on and on, never-ending, and although I had to be getting closer, the volume of the music never increased. It was like the insectile reee of the cricket, and it seemed always out of sight and out of reach. I went on and on, the piano and its player never coming into focus, and that might have been all that saved my life in the end.  

I don't know how long I walked, but it had to be about an hour. I had been barefoot and though my feet knew the path, they didn't seem to care if the path took us over sharp rocks or through summer thorns. I tried to cry out, but my mouth didn't work either. My legs and feet were soon battered and bleeding, and I supposed that if they noticed me gone, their dogs might have a very fresh trail to lead them to the scene of my demise.

As if summoned by my thoughts, I began to hear voices.

I wondered if it was part of the music for a moment, but when John's voice rose to call my name, I tried to call back to him. My vocal cords, however, were just as useless as they had been when I stubbed my toe or cut my legs. I could only manage a useless mulling sound and prayed that maybe my feet would lead them to me as they crutched along. John's voice sounded miles away, his cousins farther than that, and as they continued to cry out, I tried to get control of my body again. Just my voice, that would be all I would need. Just a yelp or a yell and they would be able to find me. Just a shout or a noise and they would know where I was. I could hear them getting closer, at least John was, and the more I tried to yell the less seemed to come out.

I closed my eyes, trying to summon up all my strength, but I was powerless to stop this.
Was this really how I was going to die, I thought. I had stood against the Bone Collector, I had stood up to ghosts and survived, and I had been brave enough to sign up to take part in a war that took me farther from home than I had ever been. I had done all those things and this was how I was going to shake out. It didn't seem fair. Why let me overcome so much just to die like this?

Little did I know that dying wasn't what fate had in mind.

"You lost, boy?"

I opened my eyes just as something poked me straight in the forehead. A little old man was standing in front of me, his weathered face looking like a canvas of the ages. He was stooped, his gnarled hand wrapped around a wooden walking stick, and my eyes crossed as I tried to focus on the large wrinkled finger that sat square in the center of my forehead.

It took me a moment to notice that the music had ceased to be replaced by the sounds of insects as the forest came back to life.

"What did you do?" I half whispered, stepping back with a harsh jerk as I pulled away from his finger.

"Got them out of your head." The old man said.

John called out again and I found that I was able to answer him this time. I called out, letting them know that I was there. I expected to turn back and find the old man gone, that was usually how it works, but I jumped a little when I turned back to find him still standing there. He was looking at me strangely, his head cocked a little to the side like a dog with a scent.

"Not your first time stumbling across the unknown I'd say?" the old man asked, and he grinned toothlessly when I nodded, "You must be the young man living with my nephew and his family."

I started to ask what he meant, but John came out of the brush then and asked if I was okay.

"We got scared when you never came back. Then Maus started heading into the woods and I suspected it might be," but he noticed the strange man then and his face split into a smile, "Great Uncle Nat! It's good to see you again. Did you have a good trip?"

"I did, nephew. I see you've made a new friend." He looked at me then, smiling wetly before saying, "Come by my trailer when you have a free moment, I would be very interested to know what sort of knowledge we might trade."

He stumped past us, making his way easily through the woods as John and I watched.

That was how I learned about the Faye Music, what the Natives call Spirit Music, and met John's Great Uncle Nat.

He was a man I would come to admire and learn much from.

The crickets in our own wood made a fantastic background as Grandpa's story came to an end. We were left sitting there, listening to the night unfurl around us before it was broken by the sound of a smashing bottle. Grandpa had launched another beer bottle into the woods before settling back in his lawn chair.

"Nat would sort of become my mentor, as Grandma had once. I would learn a lot from Nat, and it was all things I would bring back to Appalachia when I eventually returned. I would hear the Faye music again when I returned, but I was ready then and it never trapped me like that again."

I leaned my head against Glimmer's, listening for the music I had heard earlier and glad not to hear it.

Appalachia is a magical place, but it can be unforgiving.

I resigned myself to be more steadfast in my studies with Grandpa.

I wanted to be ready too the next time I heard the pipes.
