I never thought I’d write here, but it feels like this is the only place that people will even believe me. 

My brother, Alex, was a freelance documentarian with a knack for finding the unfindable. He spent years traveling to remote parts of the world, chasing folklore and forgotten histories. His last expedition was two years ago. He went to the Canadian Rockies, chasing rumors of an abandoned mining town that didn’t appear on any maps

That was the last time anyone heard from him.

He vanished without a trace. His team, two guides and a cameraman, were never found either. Search-and-rescue missions combed the region, but after months of searching, the case was closed. “Natural causes” was the official line, but I’ve never believed that.

Then, a week ago, I got an email from Alex’s old account.

It only contained one thing: an attachment labeled Echo13.wav. No text. No subject line. Just the file.

It’s important to know that Alex was meticulous about his work. He named every recording carefully, using specific codes. I recognized the format instantly. “Echo13” would mean it was an audio file from his 13th documented lead on that expedition.

I didn’t open it right away. I was too scared. The email itself was unnerving—how could Alex have sent it when he’s been missing for two years? His account had been deactivated after the investigation.

When I finally gathered the courage to play the file, I almost regretted it.

The recording starts with static—faint, crackling, like an old radio struggling to find a signal. Then, Alex’s voice comes through, distant but unmistakable:

“This is… Echo 13… recording… location…”

His words break apart as if he’s speaking through layers of interference. I can barely make out what he’s saying, but there’s one part that chills me to the bone.

“I don’t think… we should be here… it’s watching us… I…”

The static swells, drowning out his voice. Then, faintly, in the background, I hear something else—something not human. A low, resonant hum, almost like a growl, but too deep and too… calculated.

The file ends abruptly.

I thought about sending it to the authorities, but what would I even say? "I got a ghost email from my missing brother?" They’d think I’m insane.

Instead, I started digging into the history of his last expedition. The mining town he was searching for was called Haven’s Hollow, though records of it are sparse. It supposedly operated in the late 1800s before it was abandoned under strange circumstances. Workers reported hearing voices in the tunnels and seeing “shadows” that moved against the light.

The deeper I looked, the weirder it got. I found an old newspaper clipping from 1897, a miner’s wife claimed her husband had been “taken by the echo.” She described it as a voice that didn’t belong to anyone, calling out from the dark.

Here’s the thing: in the days since I listened to the file, I’ve been hearing things.

It started small. Faint whispers when the house is silent. A tap-tap-tap on the walls at night. I’ve checked every possible explanation, loose pipes, neighbors, even mice, but there’s nothing.

Last night, I woke up to the sound of static.

It was coming from my laptop, which was shut and powered off. When I opened it, the file was playing on its own. This time, the static was louder, and I swear I heard Alex’s voice again:

“You have to listen… It’s the only way…”

I can’t make sense of it. I haven’t slept since. My phone battery drains faster than normal. My reflection in the bathroom mirror doesn’t look... right. It lingers for just a split second too long when I move.

And now, when I close my eyes, I see the shape of a tunnel. It’s dark, impossibly long, and something is moving at the end of it.

Two nights ago, I made the mistake of listening to the file again, desperate to find something I might have missed. This time, I could hear more of Alex’s voice—or maybe I’m just imagining it. He said something that sounded like:

“The echo isn’t a sound… it’s a doorway…”

The hum grew louder, and then there was a scream. Not Alex’s. Something else, high-pitched and shrill, like metal grinding against metal. It made my ears ring for hours after.

Yesterday, I found scratches on the walls of my living room. They weren’t there the night before. They’re deep, jagged, and look like they were made by claws. But here’s the thing… they’re not random. They’re forming shapes, letters. I’m not sure what they say yet, but I’m afraid to try to read them.

And the whispers… they’re getting clearer. Last night, I swear I heard my name. I’m too scared to sleep, but when I’m awake, I’m not sure I’m alone.

I think the echo followed me. Or maybe it’s always been here, waiting for someone to listen.

I don’t know how this will end, but if anything happens to me, I’ll leave the [file](https://youtu.be/1OYZqrKVKzY) here for anyone brave enough to listen. Maybe you’ll hear something I didn’t. Maybe you’ll understand.
